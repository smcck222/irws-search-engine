JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: THE MEET OF THE MATTER;

HOW DO I LOVE THEE? LET ME COUNT THE SPARK PLUGS

<P>
BEING SAFELY REMOVED by age and commitment from the singles dating scene, I do 
not haunt singles bars or read the dating ads in throwaway newspapers. Besides, 
if I were looking for a mate, I believe I'd trust in the cute meet, on which so 
many movie romances were based in the 1930s, rather than a want ad or 
computerized dating approach. 
</P>
<P>
In the cute meet, two persons of obvious compatibility are brought together by 
some minor contretemps -- she drops her ice cream on his lap in the subway, or 
the leashes of their dogs become entangled in the park; the first reaction is 
embarrassment, then anger, then interest, then love. 
</P>
<P>
However, John P. Nelson of Encinitas has sent me a page from the San Diego 
Reader, a newspaper that offers a "Phone Matches" service -- personal ads whose 
authors are identified only by a phone number connecting the caller with a 
recording. The caller hears the author's "introduction" and has time to answer. 
</P>
<P>
Several ads are typical of the genre: 
</P>
<P>
"Abandon loneliness forever! Male, 38, 6 feet, seeks relationship. Caring, 
affectionate, romantic, great sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
"Accomplished executive, 27, 6 feet, 179 pounds, loves symphony, workouts, fine 
art, cities. Prefers extremely sophisticated 'professionelle.' " (I have an 
idea that an extremely sophisticated and liberated young woman might be turned 
off by the word "professionelle.") 
</P>
<P>
"Are you the playmate who can become my soul mate? Outgoing, fun-loving, female 
professional looking for adventure with the right guy." 
</P>
<P>
"Attention professional women: Want it all? Career, family? You need a house 
husband; so let's talk." 
</P>
<P>
But the ad that Parker had circled for my attention was longer than any of the 
others. To convey its full flavor, I am obliged to quote it all: 
</P>
<P>
"Could this be her? Smart, 23-year-old, atypical, Japanese-American woman, 
5-foot-5, 104 pounds, who grew up on the beaches of Southern California. I'm 
bright, energetic and look at life with a wide-eyed curiosity. I love history, 
peanut butter, vanilla Haagen-Dazs, running along the coast at dusk, and I'm 
Jack Smith's (the columnist) biggest fan. I am the world's worst skier and my 
singing voice could probably evacuate a tall building in a single note. 
However, I do love music. Musical interests range from Steve Winwood and 
pre-1980s Rolling Stones to Talking Heads and Joe Jackson. Dislikes: synthetic 
fabrics, local news and fast foods. I am a woman who feels equally at ease in a 
black, strapless evening gown as I do tuning up my car in worn-out jeans (now 
how often do you find that?) Looking for the special, witty, educated man, 
25-35, who can appreciate my inquisitive nature. Could that be you? Call and 
tell me a little about yourself and answer the following questions: (1) Of all 
people, living or dead, whom would you most like to meet and why? (2) What is 
your idea of the perfect first date?" 
</P>
<P>
Parker, who is also eliminated from Miss Curiosity's consideration by age and 
marital status, observes that "her preference for your work is listed at the 
point at which religion and politics are listed in other ads." He wonders what 
that means. I assume it means that Miss Curiosity is apolitical and 
non-religious -- qualities that would not lower her in my esteem. 
</P>
<P>
Since I am not eligible as an object of her romantic interest, perhaps there is 
no point in my answering her two questions. However, like her, I am incurably 
curious, and I wonderhow I might answer them if it mattered. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, I said here that given the chance to meet any woman, living or dead, 
I'd take one of the living. But since none of those I named has called, I'm 
reverting to Cleopatra, assuming that we could somehow overcome the language 
barrier; and my idea of the perfect first date would be drifting down the Nile 
in Cleo's barge, sipping champagne and popping peeled grapes into my mouth, 
listening to Cleo sing love songs while she accompanied herself on the lute. 
What happened afterward I would leave to the gods. 
</P>
<P>
Considering her singing voice, Miss Curiosity doesn't fit into that picture 
very well. But then Cleo wasn't perfect, either. I have an idea that she was 
arrogant and a bit headstrong and liked having her way. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't call Miss Curiosity's number, for obvious reasons. But we do have a 
few things in common. I like history; I look at life with a wide curiosity; I'm 
bright and atypical and I grew up on the beaches of Southern California. I love 
to walk, not run, along the coast at dusk, and I'm a peanut butter junkie. 
</P>
<P>
However, I'm afraid her taste for the pre-1980s Rolling Stones and the Talking 
Heads would rule me out. I have no doubt, though, that her Mr. Right will share 
that affliction. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, I do wish my wife could tune my car.

MAN BITES TOWN: IN DEFENSE OF DIRT;

CODE OF ETHICS? WE DON'T NEED NO STINKING CODE OF ETHICS

I don't remember who said it, and one of the perks of being a columnist is that 
you don't have to retain petty journalistic details, but an L.A. City Council 
member made this comment just before that body thoroughly deveined the most 
recent attempt at a code of ethics for city officials: 
</P>
<P>
"Just because Mayor Bradley made a mistake in judgment, that doesn't make all 
of us crooks." 
</P>
<P>
Now, obviously, it doesn't make Mayor Bradley a crook either, unless his 
mistake in judgment involved violating a criminal statute or two. But there's a 
larger point here. The councilman -- and I really wish I could remember who it 
was, but they all kind of blend together -- was saying, I think, that just 
because we elect a person to hold power over us; agree to be forced to fork 
over the money that goes for, among other things, his salary; and empower him 
to render decisions that can make other people very rich, there's no particular 
reason why strictures against accepting bribes should apply to that person any 
more than to you and me. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, in the eyes of the law, the odds should be assumed to be equal 
that Occidental Petroleum would pay you, or somebody at City Hall, to undergo a 
sudden attitude change about oil drilling in the Palisades. And, really, that's 
only basic fairness. 
</P>
<P>
The real problem here is that, as another council member pointed out, L.A. is 
the cleanest city in the nation. He wasn't referring to the sidewalks or the 
bookstores; he meant his and his colleagues' particular nest. An ethics code 
would only make matters worse. 
</P>
<P>
Because what makes other cities' politics so vibrant, so interesting, so 
capable of competing for air time with grisly serial killings, is dirt. Think 
about it. How many of us would spend a substantial part of our waking lives 
paying attention to show business if the real scoop were that it's the cleanest 
industry on the planet? This, in fact, is the reason celebrities telling us 
about their recoveries from addiction to disgusting habits are such thorough 
bores. They seem to miss the crucial point: It was their disgusting habits that 
made us love them, or at least remember who they were. 
</P>
<P>
People in New York or Chicago can tell one city councilman or alderman from 
another. They know exactly who's on the take from whom, which guy or gal is in 
the pocket of which developer, union or mobster. Only in Lake Woebegon is the 
public's consciousness sufficiently becalmed that one pol can be distinguished 
from another by which church he chooses to favor with his faith. 
</P>
<P>
So it's not accidental that the cleanest city in the nation also has the fewest 
people who know or care about what goes on downtown. Being the cleanest means 
being the most boring, which in turn means we pay so little attention that even 
if it weren't the cleanest, we wouldn't know. It's what the computer people 
call synergy, or telesis, or something. 
</P>
<P>
This was why hopes were raised so high last year when the mayor had his little, 
you know, mistake in judgment. But even after we learned that possible 
indications of culpability had been whited out, we weren't so much roused to 
indignation as nudged into the kind of tolerant disappointment you feel when an 
expensive, old bottle of wine, upon opening, turns out to be headed around the 
vinegar bend. "It's too bad," we thought as we opened a bottle of younger stuff 
and turned our thoughts to "Batman's" grosses. 
</P>
<P>
So the watering down of the code of ethics is a promising first step. In 
conjunction with the yawns that greeted the mayor's, you know, mistake in 
judgment, it may embolden our city fathers and mothers to more provocatively 
flagrant misbehavior. But high public awareness of local politics depends on 
another development: the arrival in town of an ambitious egotist with a catchy 
moniker who figures that a hot new way to make a name for himself in local TV 
news is to know, and say, where the bodies are buried. Is there a Geraldo Jr.? 
How could there not be? 
</P>
<P>
It's probably fortunate, though, that he hasn't hit town yet. If, let's say, 
the airline pilots who live around here had heard the councilman's "crooks" 
remark, they might get carried away and refuse to take random urine tests. 
"Just because the captain of the Exxon Valdez made a mistake in judgment, that 
doesn't make all of us drunks or dope fiends." And where would that leave the 
War on Drugs?

WILL DIANNE FEINSTEIN PLAY IN PACOIMA?;

<P>
SAN FRANCISCO'S EX-MAYOR FINALLY VENTURES SOUTH -- AND INTO THE DOWN-AND-DIRTY 
WORLD OF BIG-TIME POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

research librarian, contributed to this article.

<P>
DIANNE FEINSTEIN'S Tudor house in the gated cul-de-sac of Presidio Terrace is 
right out of a European storybook with its rolled eaves and soaring gables, its 
tiny windows in odd places. Built in 1910 and purchased by Feinstein six years 
ago, it is paneled with finely grained oak, and from the formal parlors on the 
ground floor to the canopied beds and cheerful reading room above-stairs, every 
part of the house has her touch. Ancient Tibetan scrolls, some purchased during 
her treks in the Himalayas, adorn the walls. Upstairs, the Webster of London 
clock over the fireplace emits a measured, stately tick. Fresh tulips burst out 
of a crystal vase on a massive mahogany desk. 
</P>
<P>
Housekeeper Shirley Gilbertson attends Feinstein as though she were her 
daughter. Cookies and pots of coffee and tea are trundled up and placed on 
lacquered trays. Lying around the reading room are lavishly illustrated tomes 
about the world, as well as the book Feinstein is currently reading, Antonia 
Fraser's "The Warrior Queens." There are photographs of Feinstein with Queen 
Elizabeth, Bishop Desmond Tutu, the Pope. And there are personal notes from 
such frequent house guests as Sir Edmund Hillary, the first Anglo to climb Mt. 
Everest. 
</P>
<P>
This is Dianne Feinstein's world, one so removed from the rest of California as 
not to be in the same state. But into this secure, sophisticated environment, 
the uncertain and often grubby business of big-time politics now intrudes. 
Feinstein, who dominated San Francisco's life as mayor from 1978 to 1988, is 
running for governor of California, the first woman ever seriously to seek the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
She is learning that this cannot be done from her refuge on a hill in San 
Francisco, that it means living for much of the time out of a rented condo in 
vast, rude Los Angeles, a city she has visited rarely during the past decade 
and has never liked. It means pressing the flesh at a thousand little 
get-togethers from San Diego to Fresno, a process she does like once she gets 
over the hurdle of shaking that first hand. And it means trying to convince 
campaign donors that she, not Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, would be a more 
formidable Democratic opponent in the fall for the presumptive Republican 
nominee, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson. This last part is the hardest because Feinstein 
hates asking for money and especially hates doing so in Southern California, 
where Van de Kamp built a network of donors during all those years she was 
sticking close to her cozy City by the Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably misjudged one thing," Feinstein says. "Southern California, among 
the political insiders, is a much more closed community than I thought it was. 
It is not as easy to break into as I thought it was. There is a certain liberal 
chic down here connected to Hollywood that is daunting. So it's been a much 
more lonely situation than I had expected." 
</P>
<P>
For months she has badly trailed Van de Kamp and Wilson in the polls, but the 
most recent California Poll shows that she has pulled even with both, largely 
because of a strategic $600,000 TV buy. Although the race will continue to be 
volatile, Feinstein's gain impressed political insiders, who point out that she 
squandered most of the past two years when she should have been laying the 
groundwork for the campaign. "We underestimated how hard this was going to be," 
admits Feinstein's husband, Richard C. Blum, a wealthy investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
Like the men she is up against, Feinstein hasn't articulated a cohesive vision 
of the state's future or been associated with any compelling political idea. 
Moreover, the professionals gossip privately that she is politically inept, 
that she doesn't have a clue about how to run statewide and won't buckle down 
and do the tough slogging that goes with campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is a quality about this pragmatic, efficient, experienced 
middle-of-the-road Democrat that keeps the pundits from writing her off. They 
all talk with a little awe about the special attraction of this 56-year-old 
woman: "You get her up there on that tube, and whoa, you've got something," 
says Washington media consultant Ray Strother. "Most politicians come on and 
you hit the zapper. But Dianne talks, you watch." 
</P>
<P>
Simply stated, the television camera, that cold arbiter of modern political 
campaigns, likes Dianne Feinstein, to borrow the description used in Hollywood 
to explain star power. Van de Kamp and Wilson must battle the perception that 
they are two boring white guys trying to bury each other with policy papers; 
Feinstein, in contrast, has an arresting television presence not unlike that of 
Ronald Reagan or Gary Hart or Jesse Jackson. She uses it to the hilt and was 
the first candidate to broadcast commercials, boasting of her mayoralty and her 
toughness in backing the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
And there is something else that keeps Feinstein in the game, something more 
that keeps driving her out onto the hustings when she would rather hibernate 
with her books. Her years as mayor showed that she is an able administrator who 
brought together competing groups, improved city services and started tackling 
the city's AIDS crisis. She has a passion for public policy, one that she got 
from the lively dinner-table discussions of her childhood in the elegant 
mansion across the street from where she now lives. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein is a self-confident, slightly shy woman who is almost 6 feet tall in 
high-heeled shoes -- an arresting presence in expensive, boldly colored 
conservative suits. She is fairly good at small talk and has a quick, bawdy 
laugh. But this is sometimes undercut by an aloof -- even regal -- bearing that 
may have to do with the manners she was taught as a child. "Goody Two-Shoes," 
some have called her. There is clearly an "executive" style about her : She 
once shared her rules for getting ahead with a business magazine (put in more 
time than anybody else; be a team player; thank those who help you; never cry). 
She clearly sees herself as more cut out to be queen than one of the courtiers. 
She likes to argue, to bore in and say things like, "Now why is that? Tell me. 
Help me understand it." One is convinced she is giving you undivided attention. 
</P>
<P>
She is public spirited, she is marketable, she is interesting, a swatch of red 
in the drab world of modern politics. Yet there are fundamental doubts among 
her friends and foes: Can Feinstein leave San Francisco behind her and make her 
pitch across the stupendously varied landscape of this state? Does she have the 
steel to go out, day after day, and really chase after the job of governor? She 
became mayor, after all, by a tragic fluke. But no one will inherit or have 
thrust upon them the top job in California. 
</P>
<P>
FEINSTEIN'S POLITICAL career was reborn just as it was withering away. As a 
member of the city's Board of Supervisors, she had run for mayor twice, losing 
badly both times. Crushed by the second defeat, Feinstein announced that she 
would not run for mayor again. And by November, 1978, depressed over the death 
of her second husband from cancer, she wanted out of politics altogether. 
</P>
<P>
But within hours of informally telling reporters she was getting out, 
everything was turned upside down by an assassin's bullets. Mayor George 
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, a leader in the city's large gay community, 
were shot down in City Hall by a disgruntled former supervisor, Dan White. As 
board president, Feinstein automatically became acting mayor. She rose to the 
challenge with strength and grace. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand what an awful time it was then to appreciate what 
Dianne did," says Airport Commissioner Mo Bernstein, a longtime city power 
broker, who is often critical of Feinstein. "The gays were up in arms because 
of Harvey's killing. We'd just had the Jonestown massacre (in which 900 members 
of the Rev. Jim Jones' People's Temple, most from the Bay Area, died in a mass 
suicide). The city was in shock. And I don't think you'll find many people who 
won't agree that Dianne did a great job of pulling us together." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein was a reassuring presence in the days after the assassinations. She 
spoke soothingly but firmly on television. She retained most of Moscone's 
staff. She reassured gays by appointing another gay man to Milk's seat. "Mrs. 
Feinstein provided a voice for the city's sorrow and its aspirations. She was 
poised. She was eloquent. She was restrained. And she was reassuring and 
strong," the Chronicle editorialized. 
</P>
<P>
In the next 18 months, her leadership style became familiar to San Franciscans. 
She expressed her views with verve. She worked long days. Moscone had been a 
casual leader, but under Feinstein, the staff was told that coming to work in 
blue jeans was not acceptable. She immersed herself in the issues of the city, 
although questions since have been raised about her budgetary acumen. Although 
she had widespread support in the influential gay community, she avoided being 
tied too closely to interest groups. She was not averse to seeking compromise. 
</P>
<P>
As her daughter, Katherine, 32, puts it: "My mother is very tough and at the 
same time very compassionate, very caring. What I admire about her most is that 
she thinks things through for herself." 
</P>
<P>
But others detected a shortage of political savvy. Some officials complained of 
a tendency she had to become ensnared in minutiae. "Dianne could never 
delegate," Bernstein says. "She had to have her hands on everything in City 
Hall." 
</P>
<P>
And she was well aware that she was navigating in a man's world. As she puts 
it: "I think being a woman politician is a special problem. You have to know 
what you are talking about because the press will always challenge what you say 
in a way they do not challenge a male politician. I drive my staff crazy, I 
want every fact checked, every fact sourced." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein says that she had no plans to run for mayor in 1979 but did so 
"because, as a lame duck, I couldn't hold the city together." She needed help, 
though. Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, the shrewdest politician in San 
Francisco, had to take over her campaign after she failed to escape a runoff. 
Their alliance went back to Feinstein's strong support for the civil-rights 
movement in the 1960s and to the common ground they share as outsiders -- a 
Jewish woman, a black man -- in a world dominated by white men. To help 
Feinstein, Brown brought in political operatives who knew how to reach key 
people in the powerful neighborhood groups, and they put hundreds of volunteers 
on the street. It was classic machine politics, something Feinstein had no 
grasp of, according to Brown. The result was election to the mayor's job at 
long last. 
</P>
<P>
As Feinstein began developing her own agenda and revealing more of her 
executive style, it became clear that she was neither interested in nor skilled 
at backroom politics -- or in the grass-roots work of electoral politics. It is 
a trait that goes to the heart of her slow-starting gubernatorial campaign. 
"Dianne," Bernstein says, "doesn't know any more about politics than a mouse 
running across this floor." 
</P>
<P>
Brown agrees, although he puts a positive spin on it; after all, he is 
supporting Feinstein this year, as he has supported her political career since 
it began. "Yeah, . . . Dianne is almost unsuited to politics," he says. "She's 
too candid, too direct, too incapable of game-playing. But I think that's why 
she'd make a good governor. 
</P>
<P>
"She genuinely cares about issues; she's almost a social worker in that regard, 
a Florence Nightingale. I mean, she once got out of her car and gave some bum 
in the Tenderloin mouth-to-mouth resuscitation." (Actually, it was an elderly 
man who had collapsed on the street.) "Ain't no way that Willie Brown or most 
of these other politicians are going to do something like that," he says. "No 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein moved cautiously through her first term, finding support among her 
friends on the Board of Supervisors for several significant accomplishments, 
including putting more police on the street and improving garbage pickup and 
public transportation. But almost without warning, a fringe group called the 
White Panthers, angry because Feinstein supported strict controls on handguns, 
forced a special recall election. Once again, Brown waded in to help her, and 
Feinstein also hired a crafty local consultant named Clint Reilly. She turned 
back the recall decisively, thus discouraging serious opposition in the regular 
election of 1983. 
</P>
<P>
In her second term (by law she could not run for a third), she overhauled the 
city's waste-treatment system and lobbied for federal money to help rebuild the 
fabled cable-car system after many residents had sadly concluded that the cars 
would be lost forever. And in perhaps the most contentious battle, she helped 
draw up the "Downtown Plan," a growth compromise that gave high-rise developers 
some of what they wanted but restricted the proliferation of skyscrapers that 
had changed the once-quaint city. Some of the city's most powerful people, such 
as the developer and Democratic Party financial angel Walter Shorenstein (who 
no longer speaks to her), wanted to build and build and build as the city made 
a halting bid to become a major financial center. The developers were opposed 
by the neighborhood groups that have surprising power in a city where land is 
so precious that the dead are buried elsewhere because there is no room for 
cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein spent four years crafting the compromise, which limited the tallest 
new buildings to a four-block area and set other restrictions. But to get the 
plan past the supervisors, she had to allow some high-rise projects already on 
the drawing boards to go through. The neighborhood groups never forgave her and 
eventually got tougher restrictions through a ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein also confronted the AIDS crisis, pushing city bureaucrats -- 
unsuccessfully at first -- to close the bathhouses where many experts thought 
the disease was being spread and lobbying for more federal aid to the city's 
AIDS treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
Some gays think Feinstein is too "goody-goody," according to James Haas, a 
prominent gay political activist in the city, who said, "I honestly think she 
couldn't care less what we do in bed. It's just that she wants everybody in bed 
by 11 p.m." But many were furious with Feinstein on one major issue in the 
mid-1980s -- when she vetoed a "domestic partners law," which would have 
granted city benefits to live-in companions of city employees. 
</P>
<P>
She is proud of her relationship with the gay community, saying: "I was the 
first major candidate in the city to go to a gay event. It was when I ran for 
supervisor in 1969; I think they were surprised I accepted. Later, I was the 
first supervisor to hire openly gay staff people. In 1970, I sponsored the 
first amendment to the city's anti-discrimination ordinance to provide that you 
shall not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein was generally well regarded when she left office in 1988 -- shortly 
before she stepped down, 66% of the city's voters said she had done a good or 
excellent job. But that was before her successor, Art Agnos, looked at the 
books and realized that the budget she'd left behind had a deficit of $180 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The city's chief financial adviser, Sam Yockey, says Feinstein created the 
deficit by using a mid-1980s surplus for day-to-day expenses. Feinstein says 
the deficit was caused by factors beyond her control, among them shrinking 
federal aid, a new local law increasing benefits for some city employees and a 
repeal of a utility users' tax. But Van de Kamp is expected to hammer Feinstein 
on the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"The other thing about Dianne," Yockey says, "is that she gets these pet 
peeves. She'd come to budget hearings and intimidate the hell out of people. 
She'd focus on the micro stuff, like how much was being spent by various 
departments on training and travel. But there was no macro vision." 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Brown, too, mentions Feinstein's tendency to drift, her lack of 
discipline. "Dianne's talent is not rooted in creativity. You have to call her 
attention to the issue and make a case and even offer a solution. Once she 
focuses," he says, pausing. "Once she focuses, the results are probably 
unmatched." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, who once said her long-range goal is to become "the first female 
chief executive of this country," was seriously considered for the national 
Democratic ticket in 1984 and gained important national exposure. Her husband 
worked quietly to position his wife to be chosen for the job by presidential 
nominee Walter F. Mondale. Mondale publicly named several leading contenders he 
was considering, including Feinstein, who gained added attention as the host of 
the party's convention. But the spot ultimately went to New York Congresswoman 
Geraldine A. Ferraro, who was being pushed by party insiders such as 
then-Speaker of the House Tip O'Neil. 
</P>
<P>
There are other explanations for Mondale's decision. "Dick (Blum) asked me in 
late '83 if I thought Fritz would win the nomination, and I assured him he 
would," says Mickey Kantor, a well-connected L.A. lawyer who is supporting Van 
de Kamp. "Dick asked if I thought Fritz might consider picking Dianne as his 
running mate, and I said he might, but what she should do is endorse him right 
away and then let us put her on the campaign trail for us. She endorsed Fritz 
and I set up a speaking schedule for her," Kantor continues, "but she never 
left San Francisco, never did anything for us down here or anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
In Kantor's mind, as in others' before, Feinstein was either lazy or unwilling 
to venture beyond her secure world in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
FEINSTEIN WAS reared in a comfortable, well-connected family, but her childhood 
also had its pain. Her Polish Jewish grandfather had immigrated to San 
Francisco early in this century. Her father, Leon Goldman, became a noted 
surgeon and a beloved professor at UC San Francisco Medical School. He married 
Betty Rosenburg, the daughter of Russian Christians who fled St. Petersburg in 
1917, and settled in Eureka before moving south. Leon and Betty, who are now 
dead, had three daughters; Dianne is the eldest. 
</P>
<P>
When Dianne was a young girl, her father's brother Morrie came to live with the 
family, and it was from Leon's and Morrie's nightly arguments that Feinstein 
first got her taste for politics. Leon Goldman was a Republican, a believer in 
self-reliance, suspicious of unions. Uncle Morrie was more of an urban 
populist, a clothing manufacturer with little education but plenty of smarts. 
He walked all over the city -- often with Dianne at his side -- delighting in 
the swank hotels off Union Square no more than the scruffier establishments of 
the Tenderloin. 
</P>
<P>
There is a bit of both men in Dianne Feinstein. She flies first class, likes 
such Republican concepts as "management by objective" and has no apologies for 
her wealth. Asked if it hinders her ability to connect with voters, she says : 
"I would like for everybody to have what I have. I know that's impossible, but 
there is one thing government can provide and that is opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, she also likes to drink beer and watch pro football. And she 
has taken under her wing a black youth, Anthony Bell, who grew up far from her 
life of privilege. Anthony, whom she met when she began going to the city's 
poor Hunter's Point section, often visits her and calls seeking advice about 
schoolwork and jobs. His picture is on the mantel of her rented condo in 
Century City. 
</P>
<P>
As a girl, Feinstein was horse crazy, getting up before dawn every day to go to 
the stables down in the San Francisco flats. It was one way to get her mind off 
a difficult relationship with her mother, who had a brain disorder that was not 
discovered until the CAT scanner was invented. According to Feinstein, Betty 
Goldman's mood swings were terrifying. "My mother was difficult," she says. 
"There were things I don't want to go into -- alcoholism, suicide attempts. We 
didn't know that a part of her brain that governs reason just wasn't 
operating." Once, after a row, Betty locked her daughter out of the house for 
the night even though Dianne had to take her college boards the next day. 
Dianne spent the night in the family car. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein says that although her mother's illness made things rough at times, 
she does not think she had an unhappy childhood. Her father and her uncle doted 
on the young tomboy. "It was not always easy with my mother, but she was still 
a good mother. She took good care of me and my sisters. I think I can say I was 
happy growing up." 
</P>
<P>
She was educated in public schools until she was ready for high school, when 
her mother insisted that she attend Convent of the Sacred Heart, a favorite of 
wealthy San Franciscans. Since even wealthy Jews in those days were rarely 
admitted to the top social circles in the city, Betty Goldman's choice was an 
attempt to help her daughter crack those circles. To please her father, 
Feinstein also went to Jewish religious school. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the first Jew at Sacred Heart," she says. "And it turned out to be a 
pretty good recipe. In Judaism, you believe in a code of morality and ethics to 
live as the one God would have you live. In Catholicism, it is more a 
day-to-day code, and I eventually found a lot of solace in the Catholic 
Church." (She does not attend services of either faith regularly but says she 
draws strength from both; when her second husband died, she went to church to 
light a candle.) 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein says the nuns at Sacred Heart spotted a lack of discipline in her 
that they tried to cure, without much success. In college at Stanford, she 
played golf and partied too much. "I was not a distinguished student. I took a 
course called Western Civilization and I really applied myself in the first 
quarter and got an A-plus. So they put me in independent study, a big fat 
mistake," she recalls. "I went and played, didn't study at all." She planned to 
study medicine but got a D in genetics and switched to history and political 
science. "I got an A-plus in American Political Thought and realized this was 
my aptitude." 
</P>
<P>
The good-looking young woman earned some extra money modeling, showing off furs 
on a local TV show her uncle started. She was elected student body vice 
president at college and thought about how to buck the unbroken tradition of 
male presidents. She claims that she conducted her own informal poll and found 
out that the men "would rather elect a duck or a pig than a woman." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating, she returned to San Francisco to take a Coro Fellowship, 
which allowed her to spend a year studying the district attorney's office. 
There she met Jack Berman, a prosecutor 11 years her senior. Within months, 
they eloped -- to Los Angeles, because no rabbi in San Francisco would dare 
marry Leon Goldman's daughter in secret to an older man. The couple had a 
daughter, Katherine, who today is an attorney on leave to work in her mother's 
campaign. She is Feinstein's only child. 
</P>
<P>
The marriage to Jack Berman, now a Superior Court judge, foundered when 
Katherine was a baby. "He was brilliant, worldly," Feinstein says. "But he 
wanted to keep me barefoot and pregnant. I could not be that kind of wife." 
They divorced in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
On her own with a small child, Feinstein got an appointment in the early 1960s 
to a state board that handles prison terms and parole requests for women. One 
night at a party in San Francisco, a nice man stooped to shake little 
Katherine's hand. He was Bertram Feinstein, a top neurosurgeon and a man 20 
years older than Dianne. They began dating and soon were married -- this time 
with her father's blessing. Bert Feinstein put Dianne back into the kind of 
secure world in which she had grown up. 
</P>
<P>
"Bert was like a father figure to Dianne," says Henry Berman, a family friend 
who is now Feinstein's campaign treasurer. "He was a doctor, and doctors are 
busy seven days a week. That was great because Dianne was never cut out to be a 
housewife." She didn't have to wait to cook dinner at an appointed hour. "She 
can't even boil water. So she created a life for herself in politics." 
</P>
<P>
In 1969 she announced for the Board of Supervisors. A number of powerful men, 
including former Mayor Elmer Robinson, tried to discourage her because there 
was a woman on the board and they thought that one was enough. Feinstein not 
only ran but, relying heavily on television ads, received the most votes. As 
the top vote-getter, she automatically became president of the board, the first 
woman in that job. Duane Garrett, a San Francisco lawyer who is Feinstein's 
campaign chairman, recalls that as a supervisor, "she was a League of Women 
Voters politician," concerned about good government issues and obscure 
neighborhood disputes. But Feinstein was more ambitious than Garrett and others 
had expected. In 1971, she challenged one of the city's most powerful men, 
Mayor Joseph Alioto. He trounced her. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein met Dick Blum while heading a board of economic advisers for the 
city. They began dating in 1978, after his divorce and after Bert Feinstein's 
death. Blum and Feinstein were married in a City Hall service in January, 1980. 
Blum, 54, is a tall, aggressive man who led the first American climbing party 
to approach Mt. Everest from the Chinese side. His father once sold underwear 
in San Francisco, but today Dick Blum sells an investment banking service that 
has made him and some of his clients very rich. 
</P>
<P>
He won't say how rich, but last year Richard C. Blum &amp; Associates 
participated in the leveraged buyout of Northwest Airlines by putting in $100 
million, or 11% of the deal. The firm's other clients include Firemen's Fund 
Insurance and BankAmerica. The company's annual return has averaged 37% in the 
past five years, of which he gets a fee of 1 1/2% of the money managed plus 15% 
of the profits. The couple is worth many millions -- how many millions may 
become clearer when she releases their tax returns in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Blum has been Feinstein's closest adviser in her campaign for governor. It was 
he who persuaded her to hire Clint Reilly as campaign consultant even though 
she detested Reilly. And it was Blum who told her it was "good riddance" after 
Reilly quit in a noisy huff a year later. 
</P>
<P>
CLINT REILLY, a political battler who sounds like Jack Nicholson, is one of the 
few consultants in America who ever fired a candidate; usually it's the other 
way around. Last August, after months of bickering, Reilly left, charging that 
Feinstein lacked "the fire in the belly" to make the run for governor. Over 
dinner at Postrio, Reilly is still seething months later. He brings stacks of 
documents to show "that Dianne's candidacy is a hoax." Whenever Reilly says 
"Dianne," the whole restaurant seems to lean his way as in the famous E. F. 
Hutton commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly offers a memo from Feinstein telling him he could not spend money on 
telephone calls while she was hospitalized for a hysterectomy last summer. 
"Dianne wanted me to do everything for free while she spent most of her time in 
her big house on the hill. She would never do the work you've got to do to 
raise money for a race like this. She's lazy." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Feinstein also takes odd positions for a Democrat with statewide 
ambitions. For example, she sided with insurance companies during the 1988 
battle-royal over auto insurance reform in California. She backed the 
industry's proposition because it called for tort reform and spurned the 
grass-roots Proposition 103, which won, because it was supposed to lower rates 
in Los Angeles while raising them elsewhere. Van de Kamp's campaign likes to 
point out that some of her husband's top clients are insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Feinstein told the San Mateo Chamber of Commerce that what 
California needs is an Office of Economic Development. But California already 
has one. It is called the Commission for Economic Development. 
</P>
<P>
William Carrick, Reilly's replacement, shrugs at the mistakes and Reilly's 
charges. "Ah, 35 people in the state of California care about the inside 
baseball of politics," says Carrick, a folksy South Carolinian who has been 
asked to turn the campaign around. "When the voters begin to pay attention to 
this thing, Dianne is going to be ready. She wants to learn, she got some bad 
advice in the past, she got kicked around (by Reilly) and she was told she 
didn't know what she was doing. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen, she is a natural leader; she is one of the best natural political 
talents I have ever been associated with," says Carrick, who ran the 
presidential campaign of Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) in 1988. Carrick and 
partner Hank Morris spent $450,000 in Los Angeles alone airing Feinstein's 
first TV ad. 
</P>
<P>
The ad apparently had an impact: In the latest California Poll, taken earlier 
this month, Feinstein moved slightly ahead of Van de Kamp, by four points, 
after having trailed him last October by 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Feinstein acknowledges that she misjudged the difficulty of raising 
money and getting becoming known in Southern California, but says it has 
nothing to do with laziness. "There is a big advantage, for one thing, in 
running for governor from another office, as John and Pete are doing. It's 
having a platform, which is naturally covered by the press. The argument that I 
should have gotten down here and gotten going sooner is correct, but I couldn't 
do it, largely for health reasons," she says, referring to the operation she 
had last in August. (One of her top advisers privately disputes this 
explanation, saying she Feinstein did little politically even before then 
because she assumed that Republican Gov. George Deukmejian would run for a 
third term.) "I also think I have to maintain a Northern California base; the 
majority of my funds come from the north, and you can't just leave it 
entirely." 
</P>
<P>
Her opponents foresee problems -- and opportunities -- in trying to knock her 
out of the race. Having to run against a woman candidate presents special 
problems, says Wilson campaign manager George Gorton. "The voters expect the 
male candidate to be a gentleman and the female to be a lady. But you have to 
point out the flaws in your opponent and we will do it. I think if we faced 
Feinstein, we'd go after the budget deficit she left the city of San 
Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
"For someone running in a Democratic primary, Feinstein is just wrong on too 
many issues," Van de Kamp campaign manager Richie Ross argues. "She vetoed 
comparable worth when she was mayor, she supported the insurance industry in 
the prop battle in '88, she took a walk (by not actively campaigning for the 
anti-toxics) Proposition 65 four years ago. If I can keep the campaign on 
substance, we'll be fine. I don't want it to be all glitz and star-quality 
stuff because that is the way she has always tried to run." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's people are concentrating on raising the funds they will need to 
take advantage of her mediagenic personality and in getting across her message, 
such as it is, that she is a tough leader in tune with the average voter and 
not beholden to special interests. 
</P>
<P>
She formally announced her candidacy this month, promising an activist, 
accessible administration she said would contrast with the past seven years 
under Deukmejian. Her priorities would include a comprehensive mental health 
plan that would remove some of the homeless from the streets; guaranteed health 
insurance for all working Californians and early education for all 4-year-olds. 
Feinstein suggests that bonds might be one way to finance such programs without 
raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
In a tranquil setting over lunch in Beverly Hills, she explains, as all 
candidates must at some point, why she is seeking this job. "I'm a native 
Californian, I've lived here all my life and I see what is happening. The state 
is drifting. Growth is increasing, crime is increasing, the livability of the 
state for most people is decreasing," she says. "I also believe that I think 
like most Californians, that I want what most Californians want. 
</P>
<P>
"My vision for the state is very simple: It should be a state where your kids 
can get a good public education; you should be able to walk to your home or 
your car or your business and use your parks without living in fear. It should 
be a state where you can breathe clean air and drink pure water. It should be a 
state of opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
She gives an example of how she would approach being governor : Mindful of the 
Medfly furor building in vote-rich Los Angeles County, she cites Deukmejian's 
relative quiet on the the current infestation. "What the governor ought to do 
is have a fireside chat with the California public in prime time and explain 
the realities. We cannot ignore the Medfly or our agriculture will be badly 
hurt. Obviously people are upset about the spraying, especially in parts of Los 
Angeles, and they should not be ignored. But it takes a special touch with 
people; you have to let them know you do care about what is upsetting them." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein is strong in Northern California, but Carrick knows that the 
challenge is to duplicate that strength in Southern California, where a 
majority of the state's voters live and where Van de Kamp, a lifelong resident 
of Los Angeles County, has a huge advantage. 
</P>
<P>
That's why the campaign spent nearly half a million dollars airing its first TV 
commercial in the Los Angeles media market. With crime being a major issue 
among voters in this market, Feinstein took a swipe at Van de Kamp by pointing 
out that she is for capital punishment while he is not. But if Feinstein is to 
win the Democratic nomination, political experts believe she'll have to spend 
at least another $2 million airing ads in Southern California. Blum has loaned 
the Feinstein campaign $1.3 million, and another $1 million has been raised 
from other sources. "Dianne's biggest fund-raising event was breakfast with her 
husband," Ross says sarcastically. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein also has begun a direct-mail campaign that is pulling in more money 
than she had expected. One such mailing features the photos of Feinstein, 
Ronald Reagan and Clint Eastwood on the envelope. It is supposed to stress 
Feinstein's toughness. "It would make my day," Feinstein says in the letter, 
"to say a resounding 'NO' to those who would dictate to the rest of us on 
issues like birth control and abortion. . . . It's about time we drew the line 
on offshore oil drilling and toxic waste . . . and also about time in this 
state to get back to the good old-fashioned American ideal that government 
works for us." 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere does she mention that she is a Democrat, an acknowledgment that she has 
always done almost as well with independents and Republicans as she has with 
Democrats. "Dianne is trying to go beyond the traditional constituency-based 
Democratic campaign," Carrick says. The problem: Independents and Republicans 
can't vote in the Democratic primary. But Feinstein can rightly claim that if 
the Democrats want to scare Wilson in November, she may be their best chance. 
Wilson aide Gorton frankly fears her: "Feinstein is more meteoric, more 
mediagenic, more able to break out of any box you try to put her in than Van de 
Kamp." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles political consultant Michael Berman, who is neutral in the race, 
says, "Dianne has the perfect profile for a Democrat. She is a conservative who 
looks like a liberal." He explains that because she is a woman from San 
Francisco, Feinstein has a liberal image that should help her in the primary. 
But once in the general election she could move right by stressing her support 
for the death penalty, a reduction in crime in San Francisco while she was 
mayor and her studied lack of interest in the Democratic Party's liberal 
interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
Few people know California's demographics like Berman, who drew up California's 
election districts after the 1980 census. In his mind, a major "swing area" in 
the governor's race will be the rapidly growing San Joaquin Valley. It is a 
more conservative area than San Francisco and Los Angeles, and Republican 
candidates usually thrive there in statewide races. Berman says Feinstein's 
conservative side could be marketed in the Valley well enough to undercut 
Wilson. "No Democrat," Berman says, "can win statewide without getting within 
10 points of the Republican (candidate) in the Valley. I think Dianne could do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, as time grows shorter, she is honing her message. "The 
politics of the past is the interest groups: Are you pro business, are you pro 
labor, whatever? The politics of the future, which I represent, is the politics 
of the individual and of the family," she says. 
</P>
<P>
And her spirits appear to be good as she gets ready for more of the handshaking 
and money soliciting and repeated interrogations that are required of anyone 
who wants to govern California. One day recently, as she was waiting to tape a 
cable television show in Los Angeles, she chatted with a woman reporter, 
lightly poking at the men in the room. "Do I look OK?" she asks the reporter. 
"You know, men will never tell you your blouse is unbuttoned. But it's funny 
about men, they always tell each other when their fly is unzipped." 
</P>
<P>
The doubts that she would even stay in the race have now disappeared. At last, 
she has assembled a top-flight campaign team. Perhaps most important, this 
former empress of San Francisco has finally found her way to Southern 
California. And now this woman whose whole life has been lived in and shaped by 
that glittering city will begin testing her strength and her wits on a far 
bigger turf. Oddly enough, she is confident about that, too. She believes 
voters will come to see that she's not a conventional Bay Area liberal. She 
says, with some justification: "My thinking is more in sync with mainstream 
California than it is with mainstream San Francisco."

THE WINNINGEST COACH IN L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
CRENSHAW'S WILLIE WEST KEEPS CREATING CHAMPIONS -- WITHOUT STARS, WITHOUT 
STATS, WITHOUT SHOWING OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, Eric Shepard covered high school sports for the Herald 
Examiner and now contributes to the sports section of The Times' Valley 
Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IT'S A COOL WEDNESDAY afternoon in January, but the action inside the Banning 
High School gym in Wilmington is heating up. Despite having the home court 
advantage, the Pilots have trailed the Crenshaw Cougars most of the game. Now, 
in the last minute of the last quarter, they rally furiously and pull even at 
72-72. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing an upset, the fans come to life. Amid the cheering sits a calm figure. 
He's the man with the most to lose -- the coach of the favored Cougars. In his 
neatly pressed jacket and slacks, Willie West is as cool and still as a 
glacier. No ranting, no raving, no pointing, no pacing, no ref-baiting, no 
play-acting -- none of the theatrics that seem to be expected of today's 
big-time coaches. 
</P>
<P>
With two seconds left, the Cougars bring the ball up-court and get it to 
forward Aaron Arch. He turns and nails a 12-foot jumpshot -- and a last-second 
74-72 win. The Crenshaw bench goes wild. Some players drop to their knees; 
others jump in the air, and all of them whoop with delight. 
</P>
<P>
West, without so much as a smile, quietly rises from his seat and heads 
straight for the locker room. This outward indifference is rooted partly in his 
natural reticence. And partly in the fact that he's grown so accustomed to 
winning. Though he doesn't act like it, Willie West is the winningest coach to 
ever walk onto a Los Angeles basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last 20 years, his teams have had a virtual stranglehold on Los 
Angeles high school basketball, claiming 11 city championships and four state 
titles. They have advanced to the semifinals of the city tournament 18 times 
and reached the finals 15 times. With 433 victories against only 48 defeats as 
of early this month, they have won a staggering 90% of their match-ups. 
</P>
<P>
West's success has been achieved through a combination of factors, the most 
important of which is his system of emphasizing the team over individuals, 
discipline over showboating and the work ethic over freeloading. It's no 
coincidence that West doesn't keep track of players' personal statistics and 
that he's played as many as 14 players in a single half. Neither is it a 
coincidence that the young men indoctrinated in West's philosophy have grown up 
to be winners as much as his teams. 
</P>
<P>
In short, while West has been building a basketball dynasty unrivaled in the 
annals of Southern California high school athletics, he's also been molding 
young men able to overcome the obstacles of the inner city. Whether it's 
conducting grade inspections or helping fill out applications for college 
entrance exams, West instills in his players an appreciation that academics, 
not sports, will probably be the key to their future. Although the names of 
professional athletes such as NBA forward John Williams, ex-NBA forward Marques 
Johnson and National League outfielder Darryl Strawberry -- Crenshaw's most 
illustrious graduates -- may be better-known, West is just as proud of the 
players who have gone on to become doctors and lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"We just care about our kids," he says in his characteristically matter-of-fact 
manner. "It's more than basketball. We care about them after high school. We 
prepare them for life." 
</P>
<P>
WEST WORKS OUT OF an office just a free throw away from the Crenshaw gym. It's 
a small, dingy and windowless room. A space heater in the corner is reserved 
for chilly mornings. A large picture of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. hangs 
on one wall. The desk is cluttered with memos. The telephone has a long 
extension cord that snakes into the modest gym for whenever someone wants to 
reach West during practice. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the 49-year-old coach-cum-drill sergeant is putting the varsity 
players through their paces, calling out offensive play after offensive play. 
The athletes move on command, silent but intent. If West spots a person out of 
position or a low-percentage shot, he orders the team to start all over again. 
Perfection is what these hourslong, after-school workouts are all about. So the 
players won't shower until they've shot dozens of free throws and sprinted the 
length of the court several times. 
</P>
<P>
West has had to be a particularly harsh taskmaster this year. "This team 
doesn't have a lot of natural talent," he says. "They haven't come together as 
quickly as I would like. But we had similar problems last year, and everything 
worked out." 
</P>
<P>
They worked out so well that the Cougars were crowned state champs after 
beating Oakland Skyline, 70-63. Of course, West's teams have known the thrill 
of victory for years. In his first season as head coach, back in 1970, the 
Cougars not only played in the city championship but also won it. And in his 
second season, they seemed to be headed toward an undefeated year -- until it 
was spoiled by an administrative oversight in the front office. 
</P>
<P>
"That's still a thorn in my side," West says, recalling the incident. "I've had 
some good teams over the years, but the '71-'72 team may have been my best. 
There were two games left in the regular season, and we were undefeated. That's 
when I was told by our athletic director that we would have to forfeit all of 
our (previous) games because we used an ineligible player. Apparently, the kid 
had gone to school too many semesters. Without him, we whipped our last two 
opponents." 
</P>
<P>
That is the lone blemish on West's record. The Crenshaw gym may be small, but 
the interior decoration is something any coach would covet -- a rainbow of 
championship banners. As school divisions have changed throughout West's reign, 
Jordan, Fremont and Manual Arts high schools have been Crenshaw's most 
persistent challengers and have won city titles. But their moments in the sun 
have been short-lived. Under West, Crenshaw teams have played in 15 city 
championship games, and they have yet to be defeated in the state 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
"All the kids know that if you want to be a winner, this is the school to be 
at," says senior forward Omar Williams. "You know about the tradition before 
you ever get here. You just have an opportunity to continue it." 
</P>
<P>
The temptation is to attribute West's success to better athletes, as if his 
coaching ability was simply incidental. After all, skeptics point out, Crenshaw 
has produced half a dozen NBA players, and as many as eight of his players have 
received scholarships in one season. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, West explains, he has to watch some of the most talented players in 
South-Central Los Angeles leave for greener pastures in more integrated -- and 
affluent -- schools on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley. "Everyone 
thinks we're just loaded with talent and that's why we win," he says. "Most 
people would be surprised to know that the majority of our top area players are 
bused out. A couple of years ago, there were three neighborhood kids that 
measured 6-9, 6-8 and 6-7. They all went to Pacific Palisades. That's very 
typical." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Manual Arts coach Randolph Simpson: "He puts his teams together very well, 
and they work cohesively together as a unit . . . just like the Lakers. They 
don't have a lot of talent, but they play really well together, well-oiled. 
West lets each person know that he's an important part of the team, both on the 
offense and defense." 
</P>
<P>
West doesn't see anything especially unorthodox in his approach. "We teach 
basketball here," he says nonchalantly. "It's really that simple." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, find something more meaningful in West's philosophy of 
selflessness rather than selfishness. "He doesn't single out individuals," says 
Strawberry, the New York Mets outfielder, who played football, basketball and 
baseball before graduating in 1980. "It's more like a family atmosphere. It was 
a very inspirational team to play on." 
</P>
<P>
About 80 kids try out for basketball each season, and about 35 make the cut. 
West carries about half of them -- a higher percentage than normal -- on the 
varsity team; the rest are left to the junior varsity squad. What's more, he 
gives almost all of them the opportunity to play, not only during practice but 
also in crucial games. In last year's state championship, for instance, no 
fewer than 11 players scored. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to carry as many seniors on the varsity as I can, and I like to get as 
many in the game as possible," West explains. "The more players who get 
exposure, the more who are going to get noticed by the college recruiters. I 
think a winning program will take care of itself as far as generating interest. 
It's up to the coach to have the players prepared." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, West also closely monitors the progress of junior varsity players. 
He even sits on the bench during their games, which is uncommon for head 
coaches. "Since we usually are senior-dominated on the varsity, I know next 
year's team will be the junior varsity," he says. "I want to make sure they get 
as much attention and care as any of our players." 
</P>
<P>
But team hopefuls must work hard to prove themselves worthy. A few weeks ago, a 
student in a morning gym class yelled, "Coach West, when are you going to put 
me on the basketball team?" West's reply: "When you earn it." 
</P>
<P>
WILLIE WEST GREW UP in Houston and as a middle-class teen-ager had aspirations 
of becoming a professional athlete. At Jack Yates High School, he played 
basketball, but his real love was baseball. He was a three-year starter on the 
baseball team, which won state championships each of those seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But sports were segregated in Houston at the time, and Yates competed for the 
black-school championship. West hit .494 in his senior year, but he was passed 
over for a scholarship -- as were all of his teammates. Upset over the way 
discrimination had placed him at a disadvantage, West moved in with an aunt in 
Los Angeles in hopes of finding an integrated society. 
</P>
<P>
He attended Los Angeles City College, later transferring to Cal State L.A., 
where he graduated in 1963 with an education degree. He played baseball at both 
schools but could see that he wasn't going very far as a player. "When I 
realized my athletic career was ending, I fell back on my education because I 
knew it was my ticket," he says. "I wanted to help other kids realize that, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
West took his dream and headed to John Muir Junior High School in South-Central 
Los Angeles. For five years, he worked with young athletes in his physical 
education classes. When Crenshaw High opened in 1968, West collected his books 
and packed his gym bag. He served as an assistant coach on the junior varsity 
basketball and varsity baseball teams for two years, then assumed control of 
the basketball program when his predecessor, Jim Ryan, resigned. All West did 
his first season was guide the Cougars to the city title. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to West's successes, Crenshaw's reputation has long been linked to its 
sports triumphs. Basketball games draw larger crowds than any other school 
activity, including football. "Athletics have always been our claim to fame," 
says principal Jewell Boutte, who has Crenshaw's state championship plaques in 
her office. "But it's been my priority to bring the academics up to the same 
winning level." 
</P>
<P>
That may sound like a tall order, but not an impossible one. From 1984 to 1987, 
for example, the school showed the greatest improvement in the district on the 
California Assessment Program tests for seniors and earned $94,000 in bonus 
state funds. More than 20% of the school's students dropped out in one recent 
year, but Boutte says that, of those who graduated, 88% went on to college. 
</P>
<P>
What makes these numbers so extraordinary is where they are being recorded. 
Outside the gates of Crenshaw's clean and well-maintained grounds lies one of 
Los Angeles' most troubled areas. Like other inner-city schools, Crenshaw faces 
poverty, drugs and crime. Of Crenshaw's 1,900 students, 430 take part in the 
district program for new immigrants who don't speak English. Many students have 
poor economic backgrounds, with about half coming from families that receive 
federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
One of West's primary goals is teaching the skills that will enable students to 
triumph over the problems that destroy so many lives in this community. That 
means setting academic standards as tough as -- if not tougher than -- his 
basketball standards. For example, three years before the district adopted the 
controversial no-fail rule in 1982, West had instituted a similar policy. The 
rule stipulated that a student who wanted to play sports had to carry a C 
average and not fail any classes. When the district's regulation was amended in 
January, allowing an eligible student a failing grade as long as a C average 
was maintained, West announced that he would continue to enforce the older, 
stricter standard. In two decades, he says, he's had to boot only three players 
from the team for bad grades. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw players also have grade checks every three weeks and are encouraged to 
ask West for help if they have trouble in a certain subject. He makes sure they 
meet class requirements and helps them sign up for the Scholastic Aptitude 
Test, which students must take to be accepted at most four-year universities. 
</P>
<P>
The beneficiaries, of course, are the students themselves. In the 1988 
graduating class, guard Charlie Hill was valedictorian. Last year, Terry 
Cannon, a guard who expected to see limited action, was, by midseason, scoring 
in double figures. As star of the playoffs and local sportswriters' City Player 
of the Year, he graduated with honors and received a scholarship to San Jose 
State University. This year, senior guard Jermaine Boone is vice president of 
the student body, while forward Joey Drake, voted junior homecoming king, is an 
honor roll student. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that if I don't make it on a basketball scholarship, I can shoot for an 
academic scholarship," says sophomore forward Alexous Scruggs, who has a 3.5 
grade point average and is enrolled in the school's magnet program for honor 
students. "I know I have to have something to fall back on. It becomes clearer 
to me every day." 
</P>
<P>
But West's concern for his charges extends beyond his 12-hour days coaching 
basketball and teaching physical education and career guidance classes. He has 
been known to stand in as a father figure for children from broken homes, and 
he volunteers his time to the community by holding basketball camps during the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"He taught me what was important both on and off the court," says Washington 
Bullets forward John Williams, a 1984 graduate who was All-City three times and 
later helped lead Louisiana State University to the NCAA Final Four. "I 
remember one semester when Willie was really riding me hard on my grades. He 
brought me into his office and introduced me to a talented former player who 
ended up a nobody. He did that so I would see what could happen to me if I 
didn't keep up in the classroom. That's how he is with all of his players. He 
stays on top of you and doesn't let go until you get your act together." 
</P>
<P>
DURING THE SQUEAKER against Banning last month, anyone who didn't know Willie 
West might have thought he, not Joe Weakley, was the assistant coach. At 51, 
Weakley is older, balder, bigger and louder than West. He was the one who 
bounced up and down on the sideline, bellowing instructions and encouragement 
when things got tense. And when Arch sank the winning basket, it was Weakley 
who hollered with the rest. 
</P>
<P>
West is so low-key that he's overshadowed even by his own assistant. So 
low-key, for that matter, that he may be the finest coach hardly anybody's ever 
heard of. In a field that demands loquacity and self-promotion, West remains 
doggedly taciturn. "I think a lot of the people know the basketball team is 
good. But I'm not sure they all know who's the coach," he says. "I know I don't 
talk that much. I don't talk unless I'm being talked to." 
</P>
<P>
Not only does he refuse to talk himself up, but he also declines to talk others 
down. "What bothers me most is that so many of our good neighborhood kids leave 
the area," he says, betraying a rare flash of emotion. "I've heard that other 
coaches tell them they won't get a chance to play much at Crenshaw so they 
should come to their school. I never badmouth another coach or his program. I 
just tell a potential player what I think we can do for him and let him decide 
for himself." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his brilliant record, West has never received any serious offers to 
move into the spotlight of college or professional basketball. True, basketball 
-- especially at the high school level -- isn't as popular in Southern 
California as it is in the East, the South and the Midwest, but it's surprising 
that athletic directors and general managers aren't beating a path to West's 
door. Several years ago, West applied for an opening at Cal State L.A. but 
wasn't interviewed. The same thing happened later at Cal State Long Beach. And 
though his name was mentioned when George Raveling was hired at USC, lip 
service was all West got. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still here because I haven't received a better offer, but also because I 
don't think it's such a bad place to be," West says, slightly defensively. "I'm 
not really looking to get out. I never looked at things in a monetary sense, 
but instead as an opportunity to help these kids better themselves." 
</P>
<P>
West also speculates that being black might be why he has never received a 
college offer. "If I was white, I bet I would have had some offers," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But Corey Johnson, athletic director at Cal State Long Beach, says college 
coaching experience was the bottom line in West's 1987 job search. "We're well 
aware of the tremendous job he's done at Crenshaw," Johnson says. "He's been an 
asset to high school basketball, and he has an impeccable reputation. But we 
needed someone who could come in and give us national exposure." 
</P>
<P>
It seems paradoxical that in his childhood quest for an integrated society, 
West ended up at a predominantly black high school. In fact, he says, no white 
player has ever tried out for his teams. A few expressed interest in 
transferring to Crenshaw but never did. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really upset about it," he says. "I almost had a few white kids come 
here, and I would have really welcomed them. Shoot, they would have been real 
heroes in the school, but they just never came. I guess it's just the way it 
is." 
</P>
<P>
West says he plans to stay at Crenshaw at least two more years to watch the 
development of his son, Willie West III, whom he has raised in their Inglewood 
home since divorcing in 1976. The younger West is a sophomore who plays junior 
varsity ball. 
</P>
<P>
"He's mostly got a football background," West says, sounding like the eternal 
coach sizing up a prospect. "He's just shown an interest in basketball the past 
couple of years. He might have a future in the game, though, he's still got a 
lot to learn."

Forbes magazine's annual list of the 400 richest Americans may be headed for an 
annual TV special -- with none other than high profile publisher Malcolm Forbes 
hosting. 
</P>
<P>
The Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. -- a division of Columbia Pictures -- is 
putting together the project. Style and format are undecided, but the two-hour 
special would focus on the biggest names on the Forbes 400 list, airing with 
the list's publication, usually October. 
</P>

Also on the kid beat: NBC is looking into the prospect of a tyke version of 
"Saturday Night Live," complete with an ensemble cast, ages 9-15, in the "SNL" 
format. Tentative title, according to a source: "Saturday Morning Live." 
</P>
<P>
NBC is mum on the project, but a well-placed source says the show would 
probably be taped before a studio audience, to avoid problems with a young cast 
performing live. Two young adults would also appear as regulars on the 
half-hour show. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the offing: a parade of NBC kid favorites, such as the "Cosby Show" 
youngsters and ALF, as guest hosts, along with grown-up stars.

Kids who couldn't get enough of Disney's "The Little Mermaid" will have plenty 
of new mermaid adventure stories and music to look forward to if the Disney 
Channel's daily half-hour "The Little Mermaid's Island" show debuts before 
year's end, which looks likely. It's been in the planning stages, says producer 
John Purdy, since before the animated feature came out. 
</P>
<P>
For the TV version, Ariel the Mermaid will be a real-live lady -- actress 
Marietta Deprima -- whose island home and undersea grotto will be inhabited by 
Jim Henson puppet versions of characters from the film. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Wright (Sebastian the Crab) and Buddy Hackett (Scuttle the Seagull) are 
among those already set to reprise their vocal roles.

Record companies have been unusually slow in releasing noteworthy new product

year-end albums by artists whose impact has only begun to be felt: Soundgarden 
and Daniel Lanois. The $25 Guide outlines how to keep up with what's fresh in 
pop music on a record budget of $25 a month (about $45 for CD buyers).

 Record companies have been unusually slow in releasing noteworthy new product 
in 1990, so we'll take advantage of the lull to reach back to 1989 for two 
year-end albums by artists whose impact has only begun to be felt: Soundgarden 
and Daniel Lanois. The $25 Guide outlines how to keep up with what's fresh in 
pop music on a record budget of $25 a month (about $45 for CD buyers). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
January 
</P>
<P>
Jungle Brothers' "Done by the Forces of Nature" (Warner Bros.) -- Not quite as 
pop-minded nor dramatic an expansion of rap's boundaries as De La Soul's 
wonderfully eclectic "3 Feet High and Rising," but still an enticing 
demonstration of the imagination and range of rap. Like "3 Feet," "Forces" is 
an especially inviting starting point for those pop fans who still maintain 
they can't stand rap. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Lanois' "Acadie" (Opal/Warner Bros.) -- Working with U2, Bob Dylan, 
Peter Gabriel and Robbie Robertson established Lanois as one of the most 
respected record producers of the late '80s. In his own solo debut, Lanois 
demonstrates that he may be one of the most rewarding singer-songwriters of the 
early '90s. There isn't the epic scope here you find in U2's "The Joshua Tree" 
or Gabriel's "So," but these gentle explorations of life's mysteries and beauty 
are framed in ethnic and roots-conscious styles (including Cajun and blues) 
that echo the soulful purity of Ry Cooder and the artists whose works Lanois 
has produced. 
</P>
<P>
Soundgarden's "Louder Than Love" (A&amp;M) -- From a distance, it's to easy to 
dismiss this Seattle outfit as just one more hard-rock band that is trying to 
reap the rewards of the rock world's continuing craving for another Led 
Zeppelin. What makes Soundgarden worth further inspection is that the quartet 
realizes the important thing isn't duplicating the Zeppelin sound (remember 
Kingdom Come's fate?), but reaching for the intensity reflected in the primal 
screams of Zeppelin's most persuasive moments. Another reason for the quartet's 
enormous potential is that the group doesn't tend to be retrospective. Like 
Jane's Addiction, Soundgarden is racing to the future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
February 
</P>
<P>
John Wesley Harding's "Here Comes the Groom" (Sire/Reprise) -- This young 
British singer-songwriter may have borrowed his stage name from an old Bob 
Dylan album title and some of his musical direction from Elvis Costello, but 
his songs about human relationships and values carry a satire, wit and 
compassion that make this the first great album of the '90s. He kicks off a 
series of Southern California shows Wednesday at the Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
They Might Be Giants' "Flood" (Elektra) -- The duo -- John Flansburgh and John 
Linnell -- is a pop-rock rarity: They write satire without a trace of smugness. 
The songs, about serious topics and loony ones, combine some of the ironic, 
poignant and biting edges associated with such diverse spirits as Ray Davies 
and Tom Lehrer. A feast of pop-rock imagination. 
</P>
<P>
3rd Bass' "The Cactus Album" (Def Jam) -- Where the Beastie Boys forged a 
merger of punk, metal and rap, the second white group to catch fire in rap 
sticks fairly close to a hard-core rap style, mirroring more of the hip-hop 
authority of De La Soul's "Me Myself and I" than the crossover dreams of the 
Beasties' "Fight for Your Right (to Party)." There are some creative lapses on 
Side 1, but Side 2 kicks in with one of the most consistent half-hours of any 
rap album. Besides, how could you not warm up to a group that opens Side 1 with 
a nod to "Our Gang" and closes Side 2 with a wink to Abbott and Costello?

RECORD RACK: *** 1/2 MIDNIGHT OIL "BLUE SKY MINING" COLUMBIA 
</P>

(a classic).

<TEXT>
<P>
Oil . . . slick? 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly. But "Blue Sky Mining" is the Australian punk-alumnus outfit's 
least outrightly aggressive album to date, with most tracks settling into a 
seething, mannered mid-tempo. The Hollywood Palladium pit-kids who gather for 
Midnight Oil's tri-annual visits will have a hard time moshing too much to this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
In actuality, the Oilers have produced an album with as much rage as anything 
this side of an N.W.A record -- probably more, of the genuine sort -- but it's 
suppressed under a mineral-rich wellspring of pop instincts in which slash 'n' 
burn 'n' croak figures less and less. 
</P>
<P>
Not that it's easy. The structure of the opening salvo, "Blue Sky Mine," is 
almost impossible to follow the first time through. You've heard what seems to 
be the chorus twice when the song kicks into an altogether different, second 
chorus: So which one is the hook? It's the kind of joyful, wonderful hit (to 
soothsay a bit) that you love -- that has a shelf life -- precisely because it 
does take a few listens to get. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other songs an American could listen to all year and still not 
comprehend -- lyrically, Oil dares to be provincial. Last album, it was 
aboriginal land rights; this year, it's the rape of the environment that 
dominates singer/politico Peter Garrett's concerns. Seems that Down Under there 
are a lot of mountains with great, gaping, ugly holes left in them (by those 
who "strangled and wrestled the ground / But they never put anything back," 
aided by "a government with axes in its eyes"), and other stuff Qantas left on 
the cutting room floor. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the anger, the apocalyptic strain of "Red Sails in the Sunset" 
(still the band's masterpiece) has been usurped by a messianic one here, which 
may help explain some of the musical evolution as well. Color Garrett a hopeful 
crank who -- in insisting on recycled album packaging, among other things -- 
puts his money where his very big mouth is. CHRIS WILLMAN

RECORD RACK: *** OINGO BOINGO "DARK AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL" MCA

Danny Elfman has the worries and concerns of a secular gnostic -- he's 
generally faithless, but nonetheless holds a sort of agnostic belief in animism 
that compels him to ask, "If you peel away the skin, is there anybody there?" 
and declare that "I'm not gonna give up the ghost." This obsession with death 
and the body/spirit split hasn't changed at all in the five years since Oingo's 
"Dead Man's Party" album. 
</P>
<P>
What has changed is the frantic format; manic adolescence has given way to 
slightly smoother music more befitting the themes associated with mid-life. 
</P>
<P>
At least, that's one explanation why "Dark" sounds prettier, less hyper, more 
mainstream and unveils less formal innovation than past Oingo efforts. Others 
might cite creeping commercialism, or the fact that Elfman may be more 
engrossed in film scoring than band efforts these days -- an argument sure to 
be bolstered by the presence here of a tune ("Flesh 'n Blood") that has already 
appeared on a sound-track album, and another (the uncharacteristically cheery 
"Try to Believe") that's actually the instrumental theme from "Midnight Run" 
with lyrics attached. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the trademark percolating polyrhythm isn't all gone, the melodies 
are increasingly easy to take, and Boingo is likely to survive as a machine for 
Elfman's ghost when he needs a break from films to throw his Angst a party.

RECORD RACK: * 1/2 M.C. HAMMER "PLEASE HAMMER DON'T HURT 'EM" CAPITOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JONATHAN GOLD , Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to five stars 
(a classic).

<TEXT>
<P>
Oakland's M.C. Hammer is kind of the Paula Abdul of rap, a fine dancer with a 
weak voice, a wholesome and charming performer who sells unforeseen millions of 
records and looks good on MTV. His platinum debut, "Let's Get It Started," 
spent months in the Top 10 of Billboard's black music chart last year. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, where Abdul has gifted and famous guys like L.A. &amp; Babyface 
writing and producing her songs, Hammer does it all himself. To the extent that 
his rhymes have any character at all, it's more or less borrowed from the 
lesser catch-phrase stuff of Run-DMC and Whodini. And when even third-level 
hip-hop producers these days are combing their parents' record collections for 
obscure Mandrill or Rudy Ray Moore grooves to sample, Hammer's lame pastiches 
of No. 1 R&amp;B hits just aren't enough anymore. 
</P>
<P>
On the new album he takes on Rick James' "Super Freak," the Jackson 5's 
"Dancing Machine" and Marvin Gaye's "Mercy Mercy Me," among other overplayed 
anthems, and it's not as if he does anything special with the songs once he's 
got 'em -- they're basically sloppy versions overlaid with bouncy beats.

ART NEWS: USC'S MALL GALLERY TO CLOSE UP SHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The USC Atelier, which has operated in the Santa Monica Place shopping center 
for more than seven years, will close April 1 due to financial constraints. 
</P>
<P>
"The old battle to keep the art spaces alive is pretty tough sometimes," said 
director Noel Korten, who has been with USC's satellite gallery since it opened 
in 1982. "There aren't any good guys and bad guys in this one, it's just that 
there's never been quite enough money for the arts." 
</P>
<P>
According to Korten, the gallery, which opens its final exhibition on Tuesday, 
has "been in a tenuous situation for the last couple of years." But until 
recently, USC had hoped to save the gallery by opening a nearby museum shop 
which would generate income for the program. But Korten said Santa Monica 
Place, which donates the Atelier's space, could not come up with a permanent 
location for such a shop, so in December, the School of Fine Arts decided to 
close down the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now (the School of the Arts) is streamlining its priorities and had to 
re-evaluate and make a basic commitment to academics. But nobody there is happy 
about this," Korten said. 
</P>
<P>
Korten added that the gallery, which has hosted site-specific installations by 
artists including John White, Richard Turner and Margit Omar, has operated on a 
budget of about $60,000 a year. Of that, about $8,000 a year was covered by 
grants from the California and Santa Monica arts councils. Korten said the idea 
of charging admission to help cover the gallery's costs was never even 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that would have compromised the whole idea of what we were trying to 
do, which is to make contemporary work accessible to people on a daily basis," 
said Korten, noting that an average of 800-1200 people visit the gallery each 
week. "To charge admission would have discouraged people from coming in at all, 
and I don't think it would have made a substantial difference anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Korten said the gallery's final exhibition, "4 X 90," has been planned since 
last summer and does not deal with the issue of the impending closure. For the 
exhibition, the gallery has been divided into four equally-sized corners, in 
which artists Steve Appleton, Ellen T. Birrell, Ernest Scott and Kim Yasuda 
will each create individual installations. For the gallery's tiny Avago window 
gallery, Korten is creating an installation, entitled "Social Fabric," which 
"focuses attention on some of the individuals who spend a lot of time in the 
mall." Both the exhibitions and the gallery will close April 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry that the gallery is closing, for a variety of reasons," said 
Korten, who added that he may still work with USC doing independent curatorial 
projects for the school's Fisher Gallery. "(The Atelier) has been a successful 
program. Nobody in the school wants to do this. We're not happy." 
</P>
<P>

Money is what you think when you walk into St. Mark's. Somebody has spent a lot 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
If this thought doesn't hit you at once, it does as soon as you sink into the 
smooth suede hug of the booths. Never has a seat embraced you so seductively. 
Then you look up and notice that despite the barren bunker effect of the 
architecture, the details here are deluxe. Just look at that sculpture (Duke 
Ellington by Robert Graham). Just look at those lights. 
</P>
<P>
And now just look at this menu. It is a hip modern tome that doesn't miss a 
trick; there is hardly a dish any well-informed eater might want that is not on 
this list. Sashimi? You've got it. Carpaccio? No problem. A nice bowl of onion 
soup gratinee? Yes indeed. 
</P>
<P>
And now just listen to these sounds. For halfway through dinner (if you arrive 
between 7 and 8:30) the music will start. You were sitting in a dignified 
dining room having a quiet conversation with friends when suddenly there was an 
explosion. Your companions voices faded away until you couldn't hear a word 
they were saying. To go from intense conversation to mere mouthings is an oddly 
disorienting experience. 
</P>
<P>
It is, in fact, much like the entire experience of dining at St. Mark's. For 
when you put all those expensive details together what you end up with is 
curiously forlorn. The whole restaurant seems lost, as if it is having a hard 
time figuring out what it wants to be. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the food. It's an ambitious menu, but the chefs (Gil Saulnier, 
formerly of Le St. Germain and Lisa Stalvey, formerly of Spago) often don't 
seem to get the point of what they're doing. The oysters are good. But the 
sashimi I tried was badly misguided. Why bury delicate slices of raw yellowtail 
under a mountain of mushrooms so drenched in sesame oil that the flavor of the 
fish completely disappears? 
</P>
<P>
Or, for that matter, why put mozzarella into a feuillete of pears and Roquefort 
cheese where it adds nothing but a slightly rubbery texture? (If you want to 
taste how truly delicious this dish can be, try the pear and Roquefort tart at 
Tulipe). 
</P>
<P>
And why serve pasta at all if what you serve comes out in a mangled clump? (One 
night we tried both a special with pine nuts, sun dried tomatoes and various 
sundry ingredients, and a regular menu offering of linguine with lamb, kernels 
of corn and red and yellow peppers; both were terrible). 
</P>
<P>
And yet some dishes are absolutely delicious. Both of the ravioli dishes are. 
One is stuffed with a mixture of lobster and scallops and served in a fine 
sauce made of sea urchins and ginger. The other, duck 
</P>
<P>
ravioli in a black bean sauce, has an Asian tinge that makes them seem like 
lusciously upscale potstickers in a fancy Chinese restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
And the rotisserie chicken is the best I've had in town. It arrived just the 
way you always wish chicken would: the skin crisp and golden, the flesh moist 
and succulent. And sitting next to this beautiful bird was a huge heap of truly 
wonderful French fries. It made a very satisfying meal. 
</P>
<P>
Roasted salmon was fine too. But boneless leg of lamb was a definite 
disappointment. A few thin slices of meat sat miserably in a spineless harissa 
sauce; they were keeping company with a tepid pile of couscous. The boneless 
prime rib was no more than lackluster, although it did come with a wonderfully 
crisp little galette of potatoes on the plate. And although there was nothing 
wrong with the boudin blanc -- large white sausages served with red cabbage and 
chunky applesauce -- it would have been a lot more appealing with some potatoes 
on the side. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more incongruous aspects of the menu appears at dessert time. St. 
Mark's, for all its hip modern airs, actually has souffles on the menu; it may 
be the only restaurant in town serving sashimi and souffles simultaneously. 
Other choices include a fine creme brulee with berries, a lemon tart with 
Armagnac and a rather dry chocolate mousse cake. But it's the souffles that 
catch your eye; they are so unexpected that you instantly know they are the 
thing to order. 
</P>
<P>
If you're lucky your souffle will arrive just about the time that the band 
does. You can watch it fall in time to the music, drink a cup of coffee, listen 
to a few notes, and walk out through those expensive etched glass doors before 
the place really starts to rock. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Mark's, 23 Windward Ave., Venice. (213) 452-2222. Open for dinner nightly; 
late dinner served from 10:30-1 a.m. Full bar. Valet parking. All major credit

<P>
Jazz great Lee Konitz had a rough time when he played St. Mark's in Venice in 
late December. More than once, the venerated saxophonist -- finding that 
whistles and honks from his horn wouldn't get their attention -- actually 
yelled at raucous customers, telling them to pipe down. It didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really not a room designed for listening," remarked Red Callender -- the 
venerated bassist who has worked and recorded with such giants as Louis 
Armstrong, Lester Young and Charlie Parker during his 45-year career -- before 
hitting the bandstand at St. Mark's on a recent Wednesday. "But they have fun, 
and that's the point." 
</P>
<P>
When St. Mark's first opened four months ago, operators Michael Quinn and 
Francois Petit, two of five partners that own the room, wanted it to be a 
top-name jazz club that was also a first-class restaurant. Several supper clubs 
in the Los Angeles area offer a mix of quality cuisine and jazz -- the Vine 
Street Bar &amp; Grill and Catalina Bar &amp; Grill in Hollywood and Bon 
Appetit in Westwood are just three. But St. Mark's is the first such room in 
the Venice area -- and one of the first to employ head chefs from name 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Quinn and Petit booked such musical giants as Konitz and guitarists 
Joe Pass and Barney Kessel. And while most customers would sit still for the 
"French-Italian with a touch of American Nouvelle" cuisine that Petit and his 
chefs devised, many wouldn't for the musicians or the cover charge that was 
imposed to pay for their talents, which ran as high as $20. 
</P>
<P>
"We started with big name artists -- mostly jazz artists because that's the 
kind of music we all liked -- as a promotional idea to let people know we were 
trying to achieve the finest in everything, both food and music," said Quinn. 
"But we couldn't maintain it. The types of artists we hired conflicted with the 
restaurant environment, where a lot of people are here for dinner and are not 
concerned with big names." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, who handles the music and business end of affairs at St. Mark's while 
Petit oversees the restaurant and staff operations, decided a lower-key 
approach was necessary. "You can have an idea or concept," he said, "but if it 
doesn't fit with what the people want, you have to change." 
</P>
<P>
So instead of the Konitzes, Passes and Kessels, St. Mark's now books 
lesser-known though quite solid artists such as Stan Behrens and the L.A. Jazz 
All-Stars (a dandy trio featuring Art Hillery on piano, Red Callender on bass 
and Earl Palmer on drums), Patrick Tuzzolino, Eddie Baytos and others. Top-name 
jazz players like Cedar Walton -- a modernist, who, like Pass and Konitz, tours 
the world -- will remain the exception, not the rule. 
</P>
<P>
But people like Behren can more than take care of business. On that recent 
Wednesday, the slim musician -- nattily dressed in a black-and-white striped 
shirt with a modern bolo tie, black slacks and shoes, all of which matched his 
full head of wavy, combed-back hair -- picked up his flute and played easy, 
cooking lines on "Swingin' Shepherd Blues." 
</P>
<P>
Then, after a bluesy version of "One Note Samba" on tenor sax, he switched to 
harmonica for a rousing take on the old favorite, "See See Rider." Hillery, 
Callender and Palmer worked in and around the leader's efforts, making the man 
at the microphone, who got hooked on the blues when he was a pre-teen, sound 
even better. 
</P>
<P>
As cheerful and vigorous as the music was, it garnered only modest attention 
from the moderate-sized crowd at the three-month old establishment, but, as 
Callender pointed out, the musicians knew what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
Behrens, who from 1976-78 worked and recorded with organist Jimmy Smith and was 
spotlighted on the soundtrack that blues bassist Willie Dixon composed for the 
1989 film, "Ginger Ale Afternoon" (Skouras), has helped Quinn with the new 
music policy, both by suggesting musicians and working the room. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Mike that there were great guys, right here in L.A., that, as long as 
the salary's decent, will want to gig," said Behrens, who leads his L.A. Jazz 
All-Stars about once a month at St. Mark's. 
</P>
<P>
The room currently alternates between swing-styled jazz artists playing 
danceable tunes and R&amp;B/blues artists, often with a New Orleans tinge. The 
bands start at 9:30 p.m., and on Wednesday-Saturday, various solo pianists 
begin at 7 p.m. Regular bands include Behrens and his Blues All-Stars every 
Sunday and Baytos and the Nervis Brothers doing New Orleans-ish tunes every 
Monday. A Mardi Gras Party will be held Tuesday, pianist Bob Long's Trio 
arrives Wednesday, keyboardist Billy Crew and the Memphis Zoo are in March 2-3 
and the V.I.P. Trio with pianist Walton, bassist Pat Senatore and drummer Billy 
Higgins works March 9-10. 
</P>
<P>
There's kind of a tricky cover charge policy. There's no cover charge 
Sunday-Thursday, though a two-drink minimum at the tables is imposed -- there's 
no minimum at the bar. On Friday-Saturday, those ordering dinner, including 
late supper, are charged $5 cover, while those coming in strictly for the 
music, whether they sit at tables in the lounge or in the dining room, or stand 
in the bar area, pay $10, with no minimum. 
</P>
<P>
And while that Wednesday may not have been jumping, the following Saturday was. 
Petit had more than 250 reservations for dinner -- the room seats 150 and the 
service staff seemed to be running all night -- and Behrens and crew, with 
Cynthia Speer adding spirited vocals, were joined by such guest artists as 
pianist/singer Yve Evans and bassist Leslie Baker. The musicians clearly had a 
fine time delivering such tasty items as "Lover Man," "Do Nothin' 'Til You Hear 
From Me," "I'm Beginning to See the Light" and "Song for my Father." 
</P>
<P>
It's on nights like these that St. Mark's can be delightful -- and 
disenchanting. The club is U-shaped, with the lounge/bar giving way to a covey 
of tables under the mezzanine and fronting the stage, with two banks of 
suede-covered booths at stage right that complete the room. If you have dinner 
reservations, or are lucky enough to get a table in front of the stage, you'll 
be able to see the musicians; if you have to stand in the back of the bar, you 
won't. And though Quinn has installed two video monitors in the bar and one in 
the mezzanine that will broadcast action from the stage, that won't satisfy 
those who like to observe their entertainers in the flesh. On weekends, those 
arriving after 11 p.m. have a better chance of securing the tables, available 
on a first-come, first served basis; during the week, St. Mark's is usually 
less crowded, though not always. Calling ahead is recommended. 
</P>
<P>
Excessive volume continues to be a problem. St. Mark's is a modern melange of 
concrete, stainless steel, brick and other non-sound-absorbing stuff, and it 
can be darn hard to hear the band, even if you can see it. Quinn said he's 
trying to overcome that drawback. Since Konitz' appearance, he's carpeted all 
the dining areas and the bandstand, put up Sonex sound-absorbing material and 
installed sound panels behind the bandstand. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we went through the sound system, and replaced a lot of hardware, and 
speakers that didn't function properly, to try to control and improve the 
sound," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Did it work? "It's much improved," Quinn said. "We have guys working now to 
eliminate the bugs. To my ear it's fine. In a place like this, there's always 
going to be a certain amount of ambient noise, but we're cutting it down."

WHEN ORDERING WINE IN THE DARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
First, the episode: We ordered a bottle of 1986 Silverado Cabernet Sauvignon, a 
personal favorite. The waiter came back with a bottle that he said was the 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
I tried to see the vintage myself, but St. Mark's was as dark as Hernando's 
Hideaway. 
</P>
<P>
I joked about a flashlight; the waiter never heard me. I could tell from the 
marbly appearance of the label that the wine was from Silverado, but I said the 
'87 Cabernet was awfully young to be drinking. I asked if the '86, which was 
listed on the wine list, was available. He left and returned to report that he 
had only the '87. I accepted it; he opened and poured. The wine was fine, but 
it was in a different style for Silverado, I thought. 
</P>
<P>
After the waiter left, I picked up the bottle and squinted through the dim 
light. And there was the answer: We were drinking 1987 Silverado Merlot, not 
Cabernet, a wine that wasn't even on the wine list. I summoned the waiter.

"Hmmm," he said, removed the bottle and snared a manager. The two tried to read 
the label. 
</P>
<P>
But it was too dark. So they went over to a statue of Duke Ellington that had a 
spotlight focused upon it. Holding the bottle under the Duke's nose, they 
discovered I was right. Hmmm. 
</P>
<P>
To the management's credit, they offered to let us keep the glasses we had at 
no charge while we made another selection. But since the Merlot is a fine wine, 
we kept it. 
</P>
<P>
Among the reds, there are a few good wines at fair prices, but the Silverado 
Cabernet (assuming the Cabernet is eventually delivered to the restaurant) is 
$24, and most other reds are above that price. Of the about four-dozen red 
wines, 34 are priced $30 or more. (There is, of course, that bottle of 1980 
Taurasi Riserva, a superb red wine, at $30. Retail is supposed to be $32. I 
wonder how long that'll last?) 
</P>
<P>
You do have to know something about wine to find the moderately priced wines on 
this list. Consider the 1987 Meriggio from Fontodi, which is 70% Pinot Bianco, 
20% Sauvignon Blanc, 10% Traminer and aged in small oak barrels. The wine is 
supposed to sell for $22.50. The price here is $35, which makes it only 2.3 
times wholesale (a relative bargain on a list where most of the wines are 
priced almost three times wholesale). But most people won't find it on this 
list. Why? The wine is listed among the red wines, not among the whites. 
</P>
<P>
Other marginally good white wine values are 1987 Cuvaison Chardonnay at $28, 
1988 Edna Valley Chardonnay at $23 and 1986 Freemark Abbey Chardonnay at $25, 
all of which are about three times wholesale -- too much. 
</P>
<P>
On the plus side: Stemware are exceedingly attractive. Service is pleasant and 
efficient. And St. Mark's features dozens of after-dinner potables, including 
Armagnacs, grappas and eaux-de-vies.

<TEXT>
<P>
"Talvisota (The Winter War)," Finland's entry for best foreign film, received 
no Oscar nominations. I am in shock. How could the academy ignore a great 
movie? The search for answers begins. 
</P>
<P>
"Talvisota" portrays the 1939 Soviet invasion of Finland. The central character 
is a simple farmer called to duty by the war. He is no Rambo or John Wayne. The 
heroic aspect of the Finns' fierce defense of their country (outnumbered 50 to 
1, little artillery support, no air force) is played down in the movie. The 
tone throughout is grueling, gritty realism -- utterly devoid of jingoism or 
heroics. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps this realism is what eliminated "Talvisota" from the running. Other 
excellent films of 1989 slighted by Oscar also were realistic in style -- "Do 
the Right Thing," "Drugstore Cowboy," "Roger &amp; Me." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a movie that portrays the Soviet Union as a vicious imperialist is 
doomed in this era of glasnost and East-West rapprochement.

IT'S A DOCUMENTARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I feel I have to respond to some of the Feb. 18 letters about the movie "Roger 
&amp; Me." 
</P>
<P>
Only a fool (or a member of the motion picture academy's documentary board) 
defines documentary as objective nonfiction. 
</P>
<P>
From "Nanook of the North" to "The Thin Blue Line," documentary has inhabited a 
region between fiction and journalism. Documentary is a form designed for 
filmic essays, and it encourages partiality and bias. I don't know anybody who 
walked into "Roger &amp; Me" expecting an impartial overview of the situation 
in Flint, Mich. I expected to see one man's view of that situation, and that is 
what I saw. 
</P>
<P>
Letter writer Tony Thomas chastises Warner Bros. for having a profit motive in 
releasing this film. Warner deserves every penny it makes from "Roger &amp; 
Me," and I can only hope it will be encouraged to back many more projects that 
will have an equally irritating effect on Thomas and his ilk.

COLE'S LATINO APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you to Quincy Jones for his Feb. 11 remembrance of Nat King Cole on the 
25th anniversary of his untimely death. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because of lack of space, while mentioning Cole's successful tours he 
missed the ones to Mexico, South America and Cuba, where he was extremely 
popular. He recorded in Spanish and Portuguese many still-popular favorites. "A 
mis Amigos" (To My Friends), "Cole Espanol" and "More Cole Espanol" are still 
best sellers. 
</P>
<P>
He sang at the opening of Rio's opera house. Wherever he sang the crowds went 
wild. He was the best ambassador the U.S.A. ever had in Latin America. His 
style, in any language, had a universal appeal.

WOMEN TV WRITERS: FOR SOME, THE DOOR TO ADVENTURE IS SHUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Women of TV's Vietnam" (Feb. 18) accurately depicts that there are few 
women writers working in the action-adventure genre but implies this is due to 
a lack of interest. Not true -- it is lack of access. 
</P>
<P>
As a former vice chair of the Women's Committee of the Writers Guild of 
America, West, Inc., I helped coordinate the Action Adventure Seminar held by 
that committee and mentioned by Sharon Bernstein in her article and would like 
to clarify a few points. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, it's important to establish that Babs Greyhosky, then with 
Stephen Cannell as a writer/producer, did not conduct the evening seminar but 
was one of a number of speakers on the panel. She was quoted as having said: 
"There aren't a lot of women in it (action-adventure television writing) 
because I don't think a lot of women want to be in it." 
</P>
<P>
It was surprising to read this because the room was filled for this panel, and 
we were turning people away. 
</P>
<P>
Her remark: "I asked the women in the audience who had submitted scripts, and 
there were no hands." I don't see how she could have missed the sea of hands. 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of access, I'm happy to learn that Toni Graphia of "China Beach" 
went from opening mail to selling scripts in just a few years under a Writers 
Guild apprenticeship program. Therein lies a dichotomy: Professional members of 
the WGAW are ineligible for such programs. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this inequity, as a member of the guild's Human Resources 
Coordinating Committee, I suggested a program that would provide staff access 
for our own members. Unfortunately, the guild's Negotiating Committee never 
presented this idea to management. 
</P>
<P>
In closing, I'd like to quote fellow WGAW member Migdia Chinea-Varela, who was 
also present for the panel, and who recently quipped in reference to our lack 
of access: "Apartheid will be abolished in South Africa before it's abolished 
in the entertainment industry." 
</P>
<P>
I prefer to think, optimistically, that those women who have preceded us to the 
apex will not use the gangplank theory of "the cream rises to the top" but, 
rather, will use their positions to cure the access and employment problems, 
and mentor those coming up behind them.

THERE ARE THOSE who probably don't remember Chicken Boy, some who have never 
even heard of him. But he was an L.A. landmark, a beacon standing atop the 
Chicken Boy Restaurant downtown on Broadway between 4th and 5th from September, 
1969, until that fateful day in May, 1984, when the restaurant was boarded up. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Chicken Boy's future looked bleak. To the rescue came graphic 
designer Amy Inouye of Future Studio. "It was either us or certain 
destruction," she says. "We figured we could move him into the studio as a 
mascot, to keep us company while we worked. We had been betting on how tall he 
was -- 8 or 10 feet. To our great surprise, he was actually more like 22 feet 
tall. We hired some nice movers, a cherry picker and a flatbed and took 
possession." Because of his enormousness, Chicken Boy ended up going into 
storage. 
</P>
<P>
But his spirit lingers on, personified in "The Chicken Boy Catalog for a 
Perfect World." Chicken Boy, Inouye says, symbolizes "someone who is different 
but dignified, who doesn't fit in but still feels at home. He is the symbol of 
striving for perfection within your own limitations." 
</P>
<P>
This ideal has spawned a rash of Chicken Boy merchandise, from a tasteful bolo 
tie to Chicken Boy print boxer shorts to a Chicken Boy Starter Bucket (a 
reusable tin filled with classic Chicken Boy T-shirt, cloisonne pin, ballpoint 
pen, mechanical pencil, post card and "The True Story of Chicken Boy" booklet). 
The catalogue also features some of Chicken Boy's favorite 
hard-to-find-elsewhere paraphernalia: a leopard-print computer cover (also 
available in C. B. print), bottle-cap earrings that frame the Mona Lisa and a 
fez for a small pet. 
</P>
<P>
As the catalogue says: "This may be funny, but it's not a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chicken Boy Catalog for a Perfect World" costs $1 and is available from 
Future Studio, P.O. Box 292000, Los Angeles 90029; (213) 660-0620.

DEBT-RIDDEN IMPERIAL, MERCURY SEIZED BY U.S. REGULATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal regulators on Friday seized two California savings and loans, including 
Imperial Savings Assn. of San Diego -- the industry's second-largest holder of 
junk bonds -- and Mercury Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision turned over both 
institutions to the Resolution Trust Corp., a federal agency created in August 
to dispose of insolvent S&amp;Ls. In all, the agency seized 12 S&amp;Ls Friday. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the year, Imperial had $9.7 billion in assets, the thrift office 
said. High-yield, high-risk bonds represented more than 10% of its portfolio. 
The institution was $60.1 million in the red, regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury Savings &amp; Loan had $2.16 billion in assets and was $33 million in 
the red, the thrift office said. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury operated more traditionally than Imperial, but had invested in several 
large hotel projects that went sour. 
</P>
<P>
Like several other large institutions before it, Imperial ran afoul of 
provisions in last summer's savings and loan bill requiring it to value its 
securities at market value rather than the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
It was forced to recognize $200 million in junk-bond losses in the last quarter 
of 1989 and had indicated that it expected to take a writedown of at least $50 
million more in the current quarter. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of September, Imperial was the 16th-largest S&amp;L in the nation 
and had the second-biggest junk-bond portfolio, behind only Columbia Savings 
&amp; Loan Assn. of Beverly Hills, according to Sheshunoff Information 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
Of the top four junk-bond holders in the S&amp;L business, only Columbia, with 
$4.1 billion in the bonds, remains out of the government's control. Analysts 
speculate, however, that it may be one of the next takeovers. Its debt has been 
downgraded by Moody's Investors Service and regulators have restricted its 
activities since November. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that Columbia has to be real close to the margin," said Bert Ely, an 
Alexandria, Va., financial institutions analyst. "I wouldn't be surprised to 
see Columbia popped (into the RTC) fairly soon." 
</P>
<P>
CenTrust Bank of Miami, No. 3 in junk bonds, was seized earlier this month, and 
City Federal Savings Bank of Bedminster, N.J., No. 4, toppled in December. 
</P>
<P>
The seizures make the government, through the RTC, the largest owner of junk 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial, the chief subsidiary of Imperial Corp. of America, had 80 branch 
offices in California, which will remain open during normal business hours. It 
had $7.6 billion in deposits in 387,000 accounts, the RTC said. All accounts up 
to the $100,000 federal insurance limit are guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1950, Imperial grew as it helped finance the post-World War II 
housing boom in California. However, under former Chief Executive Kenneth J. 
Thygerson and investor Victor Goulet, it took advantage of California's liberal 
regulations to venture into risky investments. It became a major customer of 
indicted financier Michael Milken, who was head of Drexel Burnham Lambert 
Inc.'s junk-bond operation in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bonds have declined 15% to 20% on average since the summer. Earlier this 
month, Drexel Burnham's parent company sought protection under federal 
bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
Thygerson, who had joined the thrift in 1985, resigned last July. His 
successors were trying to save the institution by shrinking it to half its peak 
size of $12 billion and returning it to more traditional practices. 
</P>
<P>
But the thrift office said in a statement, "There was no possibility of 
replenishing capital without federal assistance." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to junk bonds, Imperial had purchased a troubled portfolio of car 
loans from Grand Wilshire Finance Corp., a now-bankrupt Los Angeles-area firm. 
It was also suffering from problem loans it made to a now-bankrupt New Jersey 
firm that sold Yugo automobile dealerships in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other S&amp;Ls seized Friday was First Atlantic Savings and Loan 
Assn. of Plainfield, N.J., with $1.3 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC has more than 330 S&amp;Ls under its control with about $180 billion in 
assets.

28 IS ENOUGH: MISSIONARY COUPLE NEED HUGE HOME FOR BROOD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kathy Blackburn perched on a stool, bullhorn in hand, reciting the Lord's 
Prayer before 28 bowed heads. 
</P>
<P>
A burst of giggles erupted, but the mother of this brood -- 17 boys and 11 
girls -- was a picture of tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear kids from the time I wake up until the time I go to sleep," she said. 
Then she added: "There are times I've been frantic." 
</P>
<P>
Blackburn, 42, and her husband, Dan, 45, came home to Indiana at the end of 
1989. The two missionaries and their wards -- all orphaned or abandoned 
Haitians, ages 3 to 14 -- are temporarily living in a drafty church camp about 
50 miles southeast of Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackburns, who have two grown children of their own, began taking in 
homeless children shortly after they began missionary work in 1969. At one time 
they thought about opening an orphanage. Now they plan to adopt all the 
children, four of whom are retarded. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, unrest in Haiti forced the couple to flee to the Dominican Republic. 
Last December, they finally received permission from the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service to bring the children to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The children are Rosie and Mary, both 14; Becky, Yvonne and Jim, 12; Tom, Sam, 
Bobby, Cheryl and Jo Anna, 11; Steve, Marva and Liz, 10; Jemima, Abigail, 
Aaron, Jeremiah, Benji, Noah and Gideon, 9; Matthew and Jake, 8; Rachael, 7; 
Thaddeus, 6; Mike and Caleb, 4, and Andy and Mark, 3. 
</P>
<P>
In Haiti, the family had a house. In Indiana, they sleep in a dormitory heated 
by a wood stove and use an outdoor privy. 
</P>
<P>
Down the lane is the "chow house," the hub of the family's social life. A 
hand-made sign posted on the refrigerator reads: 
</P>
<P>
"A late meal is a hardship with 28 kids. Please have consideration for the 
cook. Thanks." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Blackburn does the cooking and minds the older boys, who wash dishes and 
sweep the floors. The girls do the laundry and take care of the younger 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Blackburn said that the secret to managing 28 children and a household is 
not to fear mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Parenthood is "something you can't cram for at the last minute," she said. "We 
do it by making mistakes, by trial and error. It's just something you keep 
working at." 
</P>
<P>
The Blackburns have many of the same dreams that others hold for their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like them to have music lessons, learn to ride a bike, know history and 
know it well, and be well-educated within their own bounds," Kathy Blackburn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The children are taught by the Blackburns and volunteer teachers who come to 
the camp to give lessons in math, science, reading, writing and sign language 
-- the last a device to keep down the noise level at home. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids aren't overstimulated," Kathy Blackburn said. "They enjoy stuff. . 
. . A jet going over or a beautiful sunset is a really big deal. They not only 
appreciate, but they comment on it." 
</P>
<P>
Rosie recently went with Dan Blackburn to a department store, where she took 
her first elevator ride. 
</P>
<P>
"It's continual questions. Even getting into a car is a big deal for them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of their arrangement with immigration authorities, the Blackburns may 
not accept welfare. They rely on regular donations from about 20 churches and 
whatever other help comes in. Local merchants have given them second-hand 
clothing and day-old baked goods. The family has received clothes, food, toys 
and money from strangers who have heard about them in news reports. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not taking a vow of poverty, but one of the things I want to discourage 
is excess -- the mind-set that you don't need one thing, you need 10," Kathy 
Blackburn said. 
</P>
<P>
The family's most pressing need is for a permanent home. They must leave the 
church camp before the season opens May 1. The Rev. Lee Creech, who has 
supported the Blackburns' missionary work for 20 years, heads a committee that 
is working to find them housing. 
</P>
<P>
"More people are in awe than anything else that someone would attempt to do 
this," said Creech, pastor at New Bethel United Methodist church in Decatur 
County. "I think it's the best way for someone else to say, 'I am my brother's 
keeper.' "

<P>
Jesse Jackson has told political supporters that he does not intend to run for 
mayor of the nation's capital this fall and will make a formal announcement 
this week, associates said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not going to run for mayor of Washington. We talked about it yesterday," 
Joel Ferguson, who managed Jackson's 1988 presidential campaign in Michigan, 
told a Lansing, Mich., television station Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a two-time Democratic presidential contender, was en route to Chicago 
on Friday evening and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has said his recent campaign to gain statehood for the District of 
Columbia will remain his priority. 
</P>
<P>
A top Jackson aide, Frank Watkins, refused to discuss Jackson's decision on the 
mayoral race. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson estimated the chance that Jackson would run at only 10%, but a 
supporter here said Jackson told him flatly that he would not run.

"Jesse is out," said the supporter, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. 
"He has decided that it would be wrong for him to get into the race at this 
time, or at all." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's political plans have been the subject of speculation since he moved 
to the nation's capital in April. That speculation intensified with Mayor 
Marion Barry's arrest last month on a cocaine-possession charge. 
</P>
<P>
Barry is at a South Carolina hospital for treatment for what an aide has called 
an alcohol problem. City Administrator Carol Thompson is in charge in Barry's 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's reported decision comes amid growing signs that voters -- and 
politicians -- are wary of a Jackson mayoral bid. 
</P>
<P>
A Washington Post poll released last week reported that Jackson would trail 
Barry if both were candidates in the September Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has repeatedly refused to rule out a run for Barry's job, saying he 
would seek the office only if Barry, a colleague in the civil rights battle, 
did not run for a fourth term.

<TEXT>
<P>
It has been 20 years since the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to 
build new embassies for each other in Moscow and Washington. In that time, it 
is said, the ancient Egyptians built the Great Pyramid of Cheops. 
</P>
<P>
The Pharaohs didn't have to deal with the Soviets. The U.S. Embassy is still 
not finished -- and won't be. 
</P>
<P>
With eight stories up, $170 million spent and water and ice ravaging the most 
expensive bricks in the world, the Administration in Washington has decided to 
stop there, demolish the building and start over. 
</P>
<P>
That will add five more years and an additional $270 million to the cost of a 
modern tale of two cities, a lumbering farce of pachyderms unique to the late 
unpleasantness called the Cold War. Walls come down, liberty soars, but in the 
new age we are left with monuments to the buffoonery of the old. 
</P>
<P>
The United States finished the Soviet Embassy in Washington, but the Soviets 
couldn't move into their chancery until the United States moved into its 
chancery in Moscow. That was by agreement, one of several that took 13 years to 
reach in tense, careful negotiations. Every major move had to be precise, 
simultaneous and symmetrical. It was like two Mafia families trying to arrange 
a truce for a wedding. 
</P>
<P>
It took less than two years to build the 102-story Empire State Building in New 
York in 1931. In Moscow, the Soviets were into year seven and still not 
finished with the eight-story office building of the U.S. Embassy when the 
United States threw them out. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was bugs. Mysterious, multitudinous, ubiquitous, anti-American, 
subversive, pre-glasnost, godless Russian communist bugs. 
</P>
<P>
In columns and walls, in concrete and steel, in breathtaking numbers and novel 
ways that confounded American experts, we were told, the Soviets had sown the 
chancery with diabolic devices to overhear, record and transmit American 
secrets. 
</P>
<P>
The United States refused to move in until the bugs were moved out, but getting 
them out appeared tougher than evicting a poor relative. So tough, in fact, two 
Administrations spent four years figuring out what to do. Both concluded that 
the only safe course was to build a new building. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, there is no louder uproar among politicians and press than the 
thunder evoked by the suggestion that foreigners, especially the Soviets, had 
outwitted Uncle Sam. The devilish dither of the embassies had all the makings. 
</P>
<P>
* Sites. After 10 years of negotiations, we gave them Mt. Alto along Wisconsin 
Avenue, one of the highest points in Washington. They gave us a plot along 
Konyushkovskaya Ulitsa down near the Moscow River. 
</P>
<P>
* Uproar. The United States had given away a strategic height from which, 
electronically, the KGB could look down the throats of the White House and 
Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
"The view is terrific," but the intelligence advantage is "considerably less," 
said James R. Schlesinger, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency. 
What's more, other witnesses testified, Mt. Alto was not the Soviets' first 
choice for an embassy. And in Moscow, the United States had turned down an 
offer of Lenin Hills to be "downtown." The high-low plot wouldn't play. 
</P>
<P>
* Sidewalks. A hearing of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on 
international operations. Back from Moscow, Rep. Dan Mica (D-Fla.) reported: 
"Where the new building is, (the Soviets) built us a 16-inch sidewalk so that 
there is no place to walk. . . . That is harassment." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Mass.) asked if the State Department pursued a 
"reciprocity" of harassment in building the Soviet Embassy in Washington. She 
seemed to think it should. 
</P>
<P>
James E. Nolan, director of the Office of Foreign Missions, replied: "In the 
District of Columbia, one does not cut down sidewalk size in half simply 
because the State Department thinks it is a good time to do it or because we 
think that it is leverage to do it." 
</P>
<P>
* Off site. Here was the real trouble. In Washington, Americans poured concrete 
for the Soviet Embassy on-site where the Soviets could watch. In Moscow, 
Soviets poured concrete off-site where Americans couldn't, or didn't, watch. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union works at the problem of security penetration 24 hours a day, 
365 days a year," testified Schlesinger, who investigated the embassy muddle 
for President Ronald Reagan. "If one signs an agreement that permits the 
Soviets to precast columns and beams off-site, the principal party to blame is 
oneself. . . . As Napoleon once observed, there are limits to rascality, there 
are no limits to stupidity." 
</P>
<P>
The result, said the expert witness, was "the best-bugged building ever built." 
</P>
<P>
It contained "a full array of intelligence devices for which we do not yet 
understand either the technology or underlying strategy. . . . We failed to 
allow for the boldness, thoroughness and extent of the penetration." 
</P>
<P>
During the building of their embassy in Washington, the suspicious Soviets 
watched every blow of the hammer. For every American working, said an American 
official observer of the Soviet observers, there was a Soviet watching. 
</P>
<P>
They X-rayed "every inch" of steel before it went up, said an architect. They 
watched concrete poured on-site. If the work went too fast to watch carefully, 
they slowed the work. They insisted that window units assembled off-site be 
disassembled and reassembled before their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
One result of their vigilance, the Soviets alleged, was the discovery of 
pencil-thin microphones in the walls and bugging wires in the weatherstripping 
of the windows put there by their American hosts. 
</P>
<P>
Another result: The windows now leak. 
</P>
<P>
Both embassy complexes include a chancery or office building, consulate, 
residential apartments, school, gym, swimming pool, playground, theater and 
underground garages. 
</P>
<P>
The new Soviet compound is in a residential area of Washington. The new U.S. 
Embassy in Moscow, like the old U.S. Embassy next door, is surrounded by 
high-rises where it is assumed that the KGB is in constant attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street is an old Russian church no longer used as such. Among 
American intelligence people, who say the place is loaded with electronic 
equipment for monitoring its neighbors, the old church is now known as "Our 
Lady of Telemetry." 
</P>
<P>
Their mutual distrust was such that the superpowers needed 10 years to agree on 
an exchange of sites to be used free of charge for 85 years. The United States 
got 11.9473 acres in Moscow. The Soviet Union got 12.5258 acres in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
It took three more years to agree on "conditions of construction" in two 
stages, each using local labor and materials in stage one and each using a 
mutually agreed maximum number of their own specialists imported for the 
second, or finishing stage. 
</P>
<P>
The original agreements stipulated simultaneous exchange of sites, simultaneous 
completion of construction, simultaneous occupancy of the chanceries. They also 
agreed to exchange architects' drawings, and each would have veto power over 
the other. And, since the Soviet Union had no market economy on which to base 
costs, they agreed that cost calculation for the Moscow construction would be 
based on Washington prices. 
</P>
<P>
Congress originally appropriated $192 million for the whole project. Now, says 
a State Department official, it will be asked to come up with $270 million more 
for the new chancery. It will cost that much because, to play it safe, all the 
labor will have to be brought in from the United States at American scale to 
build a building free of Soviet ears. 
</P>
<P>
Time schedules meticulously negotiated by the superpowers bent in the 
fluctuating heat of their Cold War and the numbing pace of Soviet labor. 
</P>
<P>
It took two years to finish most of the embassy in Washington; the Soviets 
moved into the residential and support quarters in 1979. It took seven years to 
complete the equivalent in Moscow, and the Americans moved into those in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
All work had stopped. The United States had "locked out" all Soviet employees 
the year before for building an office building abounding in "intentional 
defects." 
</P>
<P>
The invisible presence in the woodwork should have surprised no one. In Moscow, 
spying on visitors was older than borscht. The czars kept informers busy, and 
their proletarian heirs bugged the American Embassy for years. 
</P>
<P>
So regularly that guests at Spasso House, the ambassador's residence, were 
given cards welcoming and warning them: 
</P>
<P>
"Every room is monitored by the KGB and all of the staff are employees of the 
KGB. We believe the garden also may be monitored. Your luggage may be searched 
two or three times a day. Nothing is ever stolen and they hardly disturb 
things. . . . If you have anything sensitive to talk about, please call and 
make an appointment with the ambassador to discuss it in his office." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets liked Ambassador W. Averill Harriman so much that they gave him a 
handsome replica of the Great Seal of the United States. It was years before 
the next ambassador found a tiny microphone nestled in the carved wooden eagle. 
</P>
<P>
Americans have also found, they said, more than 40 mikes in the walls of the 
old chancery, bugs in electronic typewriters, signs of microwave assaults on 
the building, wires leading to a tunnel between the embassy and a nearby Soviet 
apartment building and traces of a "spy dust" called nitrophenylpentadienal by 
which the movements of people and objects could be tracked. 
</P>
<P>
Unintentional defects were equally hard on the psyche of Americans trying to 
get a new embassy built in the land of Lenin. Which brings us to a tale of 
bricks told with a lingering shudder by Charles Bassett, chief architect. 
</P>
<P>
The plans called for the 8-story chancery to be faced in brick. No problem, 
said the Soviets. Bassett quickly found problems. Available Soviet bricks were 
rough and unattractive. Lithuania looked promising but that didn't pan out. 
Likewise the kilns of Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the right bricks were produced in Augusta, Ga., and more than a 
million were carefully strapped and packaged on pallets and shipped by boat to 
Helsinki and by train to Moscow, tenderly chaperoned all the way by Americans. 
There, the Soviets had to be stopped from ruining the bricks by heaving them 
into dump trucks for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Bassett watched with horror as Soviet bricklayers went to work using no 
strings or levels and setting bricks from inside a wall on irregular lines. 
"Among Soviet workers, meeting quotas was all-important; it didn't matter if 
the wall fell down the next day." 
</P>
<P>
All work was stopped until master masons with proper tools could be flown in 
from the United States to teach and supervise. And it was stopped again with 
the discovery of the bugs, before the building was closed in properly and the 
well-traveled bricks could be protected from the weather. 
</P>
<P>
In their original negotiations in what seems like another age of man, the two 
parties set up a cumbersome process to arbitrate disputes. The United States 
has since claimed $29.9 million in damages resulting from Soviet delays and 
defective work. It has also given notice of intention to claim an undetermined 
amount for "intentional defects." The Soviets struck back with damage claims 
for $18 million resulting from U.S. delays. Settlement is not just around the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
Proving that he was no imprudent country bumpkin, Uncle Sam took out a 
$42-million policy with the Granite State Insurance Co. 20 years ago. This was 
to insure the government "against unforeseen and sudden physical loss or damage 
during construction."

NATURE CONSERVANCY BUYS UP LAND TO WARD OFF DEVELOPMENT; 
</P>
<P>
PRESERVATION: CONSERVATIONISTS WITH SUCCESS IN LAW AND BUSINESS BRING MONEY TO 
THE CAUSE AND FUEL AMBITIOUS ACQUISITIONS.

<P>
When the Nature Conservancy bought 502 square miles of New Mexico -- 90% of a 
mountain range and a more diverse population of mammals than any national park 
in the United States -- it was hailed as a milestone. 
</P>
<P>
It certainly was. But the purchase in late January was also the culmination of 
an explosion of conservation efforts in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
A new breed of conservationists is buying up big chunks of the American 
landscape, stamping the land inviolate to the bulldozer's blade. 
</P>
<P>
How much money the conservancy paid for the Gray Ranch in New Mexico, astride 
the Continental Divide, wasn't made public. But it was probably in the 
neighborhood of $18 million, a sum that would have sounded improbable to a 
conservationist's ears a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
What it brought under the conservancy's protection was almost all the Animas 
Mountain range; some 100 plant and animal species listed as endangered, 
threatened or rare; 13 pre-Columbian archeological digs and hundreds of others 
as yet unexplored; herds of Chihuahuan pronghorn antelope; seven different 
habitat types from desert grassland to chaparral and coniferous forest; and 
endangered bits of nature from the white-eared hummingbird to the night 
blooming cereus. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy acted when it discovered the ranch owners wanted to sell and 
there was the threat the land might be broken up and developed. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy President John C. Sawhill, announcing the buy, said: "Few intact 
natural systems of this caliber exist in the world today. The . . . effort also 
represents the future trend for the Nature Conservancy and its partners. To 
truly ensure our natural world for future generations, we are developing 
creative ways to safeguard much larger landscapes." 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, such an effort would have been only a dream, but 
conservationists are becoming sophisticated advocates -- scientists, business 
graduates, experts in law and real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Inch by precious inch they are preserving farmland, wilderness and open spaces 
against development, more effectively than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
The Nature Conservancy is a sort of symbol for individuals and other land 
trusts. Before the New Mexico deal, it was taking an average of 1,000 acres a 
day out of commercial play. 
</P>
<P>
Says Mike Dennis, general counsel of the conservancy: "For every scientist we 
have around here, we probably have an MBA, a tax lawyer and a real estate 
attorney." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have sharpened their skills in the private sector, recycling 
many of the same dollars each time to buy new land. They have discovered 
revolving funds, a war fund that doesn't have to stay invested. They can plunk 
down several million dollars until, by prior arrangement, a government agency 
can repay them, assuming custodial care of the property. 
</P>
<P>
Or they can buy a piece of property, deprive it of the potential for commercial 
development, and resell the land for a somewhat lesser cost to what they think 
is an appropriate buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Who is that buyer? A farmer who will farm without being tempted by high 
developer prices, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which wants to protect 
the land, or a trust that is able to preserve the land as open space, a vista, 
a place apart. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the conservationists send the resale dollars back into their 
revolving funds to be used again. 
</P>
<P>
None of these organizations or individuals could succeed without local support. 
When a developer wanted to take a 147-acre scenic hay meadow in Jackson Hole, 
Wyo., to put in 70 to 80 houses, the local land trust negotiated an option on 
the land priced at $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The county came up with one-third and the land trust raised the rest from 
private donations. 
</P>
<P>
Says Jean Hocker, director of the Land Trust Alliance, an umbrella organization 
in Washington for hundreds of local land trusts: "The community heard about it 
and came to the rescue." The deal took three months. Speed is important. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 800 local land trusts established in states, counties and 
communities -- almost half of them formed in the past 10 years. They protect 
about 2 million acres and they own 300,000. Some of them have million-dollar 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes conservationists act in concert. 
</P>
<P>
The McQuerry Ranch, 3,500 acres at the foot of the 11,000-foot peaks of 
Nevada's Ruby Mountains, was in financial trouble, the family in danger of 
losing the land they had farmed for generations. 
</P>
<P>
A third of the ranch is a unique desert wetland area around Franklin Lake, the 
kind of terrain that attracts resort development. It is also a nesting area for 
migratory birds. 
</P>
<P>
The American Farmland Trust suggested to the Nature Conservancy that the best 
way to preserve the land was to enhance the way in which the farm was operated 
by the family. 
</P>
<P>
The migratory birds and the wetland fit the conservancy's charter. With 
$300,000 from its revolving fund, the conservationists bought the ranch and 
leased it back to the McQuerry family with certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The family would have to change certain farming operations. For instance, they 
would not be permitted to graze the wetland area from fall to the following 
summer when the birds use the estuary. 
</P>
<P>
When the family was able, they would buy the ranch back, but those covenants 
would remain. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hadn't stepped in, certainly the family was going into bankruptcy," says 
Ralph Grossi, president of the American Farmland Trust. "They would have lost 
the farm." 
</P>
<P>
The farmland trust felt there was a real danger of development to the land and 
to the natural ecosystem around the lake. 
</P>
<P>
The United States covers some 3.6 million square miles, or 2.3 trillion acres. 
Of those, 78,000 square miles, or almost 50 million acres, are inland 
waterways. There are also more than 88,000 miles of tidal shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationist groups can't protect it all, nor, they say, should they. Often 
they seek to cooperate with developers, allowing residential uses, but 
sequestering other areas. In some cases, developers pay mitigation fees for the 
damage their developments might cause. Those funds are used to enhance the 
protected land. 
</P>
<P>
Says the Nature Conservancy's Dennis: "When you're talking about an ecosystem, 
you could be talking about anything from 5,000 acres to 500 square miles." 
</P>
<P>
So he outlines a compromise, a core that the conservationists want to own and 
manage. Around that they would establish a larger area where timbering and 
mining are banned. "Then you may want an additional buffer where development is 
OK, but it's got to be limited. You may allow a cluster of homes here on 2- to 
5-acre tracts and preserve farmland over there." 
</P>
<P>
Even individuals are taking a page from their book and designing small local 
operations to save such properties as a farm in Virginia or 400 acres of 
rolling countryside in Connecticut. The farm remained a farm, and the 
Connecticut tract is now home to an organically safe golf course. 
</P>
<P>
In the array of people in the conservation army, there is also an array of 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The Nature Conservancy's 542,000 members, dedicated to preserving habitats, 
have financed a $600-million organization that has saved almost 4 million 
sensitive acres since it was founded in 1953. It has 1,000 employees and 
probably 10,000 volunteers and covers every state. 
</P>
<P>
Considerably younger (10 years old) and smaller (a staff of 30 nationwide) is 
the American Farmland Trust, dedicated to saving the nation's farms and 
improving farming techniques. Yet, it churns accounts of more than $2 million 
to get more acres for the buck. 
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about the debt burden in agriculture," says the trust's 
president, Ralph Grossi. "Many farmers are going out of business and their land 
isn't being cared for adequately." 
</P>
<P>
Organizations from the National Wildlife Federation to the Audubon Society, 
from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to Ducks Unlimited, a hunter's group, 
often find themselves working in concert. 
</P>
<P>
They all have one thing in common. They can move more quickly than local or 
state governments can and, using charitable tax benefits, they can bring in a 
deal cheaper than developers can. 
</P>
<P>
By stripping a piece of land of development rights, it is not only protected 
regardless of who owns it, but income tax benefits can either bring the owner a 
sizable tax deduction or provide instant cash for a farmer. 
</P>
<P>
It also reduces the value of the land and hence its tax assessment, which 
deprives the county or state of some tax revenue. But counties and states 
usually are willing to forgo taxes on some property to enhance the value of 
land around it. 
</P>
<P>
Witness New York's Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who has asked for $1.9 billion to set 
aside areas of the Empire State for scenic and recreation purposes. California 
has provided more than $700 million for similar purposes, and Florida has an 
active land acquisition program. 
</P>
<P>
But the smallest of communities can be stirred to action. Michigan's west coast 
is a beautiful blend of dunes, orchards and sandy beaches on Lake Michigan. It 
is a magnet for those wanting second homes, and unlike the coast of California, 
which it mimics in miniature, it has no coastal commission to protect it. 
</P>
<P>
Local land trusts, with the help of the Farmland Trust, moved in to buy a 
507-acre farm on the Old Mission Peninsula, blocking any further residential 
development. It will remain an orchard in an area that prides itself as being 
the "Cherry Capital of the World." 
</P>
<P>
"It's unlikely that some crops will be grown in any quantity in the United 
States 30 to 40 years from now," says Grossi of the Farmland Trust. "The 
growing areas that are required, the climate, the soil, the weather, those 
unique values are essentially the same as those that attract people."

<P>
The Nature Conservancy has been busy capturing islands from sea to shining sea 
to provide habitats for rare, threatened and endangered creatures. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, it has led its negotiators into some strange and complicated 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
For example: Shelter Island off the tip of New York's Long Island, 6,000 
bucolic acres just two hours by car from the towers of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
A third of it was the Mashomack Hunt Club, owned by the Girard family, which 
felt very strongly about keeping it a wildlife preserve. 
</P>
<P>
It was held by a family-owned realty company that also held other family 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
The family wanted to make a substantial gift of land, but it also wanted to 
realize some cash from the holdings that included nine brownstones near 
Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, warehouse property in Miami, and a number 
of oil and gas wells. 
</P>
<P>
What to do? 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy experts worked out an elaborate deal. The family sold the realty 
company to the conservancy for less than the market value, reaping a charity 
tax deduction. The conservancy then sold off the brownstones, the gas and oil 
wells and the warehouses and raised the rest of the $12 million it owed the 
family for the realty company. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Mashomack Preserve, on the Atlantic flyway, is home for flocks of 
migratory birds, including the elusive osprey. 
</P>
<P>
Matagordo Island is tiny by comparison. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
desperately wanted the last parcel to go with the rest it managed in 
partnership with the Texas wildlife service. 
</P>
<P>
The island's inhabitants include about 140 whooping cranes, millions of ducks 
and other waterfowl. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy again stepped in and bought the land, transferring it to the 
wildlife service as federal funds became available. 
</P>
<P>
Had they waited, the land would have fallen to the 40 or so heirs of the man 
who owned it, and consensus is difficult under those circumstances. He died of 
a heart attack only months after the deal was made. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a gift becomes an ecological headache. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Cruz Island is one of the Channel Islands off the coast of California. 
Over the years the owner gave most of the 60,000 acres to the Nature 
Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
A century and a half ago, sheep were introduced to what was largely a cattle 
ranch. The sheep ran wild, eventually numbering up to 40,000. The conservancy 
brought in Navajo shepherds to round them up. It didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
They went to the association of sheep ranchers, who were of no help and were 
plainly disturbed lest that much mutton be dumped on the market all at once. 
</P>
<P>
Finally and regrettably, fencing off a square mile at a time, the sheep were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
Sheep, as any reader of Westerns will tell you, eat the grass down to the 
roots. When the conservancy got the land, the island was a dead brown. Today, 
all but 10,000 privately held acres in the south are green, and home to 
specific island species such as the Santa Cruz kit fox, island jay and others.

EGYPT'S NUBIANS ARE A FORGOTTEN PEOPLE 
</P>

ABU SIMBEL, Egypt 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dislocated and disinherited, Egypt's Nubians have become a forgotten people. 
</P>
<P>
Flooded out of their ancestral homes almost 30 years ago to make room for the 
Aswan Dam, they now eke out a living in desert villages far away. Their houses 
are set in long concrete rows along sandy streets, the harsh landscape unbroken 
by greenery. 
</P>
<P>
Many young men have left to work in Cairo and women in long black dresses and 
scarfs, their faces prematurely aged, sit outside with their children in the 
near-deserted streets. 
</P>
<P>
They dream of their old villages next to the Nile where mud houses, palm trees 
and green cultivated terraces ran down to the river. Their new villages, about 
190 miles to the north, have kept only the names. 
</P>
<P>
They dream of traditions handed down, some say since the beginning of time, 
when, like the Egyptians, the Nubians created one of the earliest 
civilizations. In Pharaonic times, the Nubians had their own kingdom that 
stretched north into Egypt and south into Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Bashir, a Nubian and director of the State Information Service in the 
town of Aswan, believes they are the oldest people in the world. 
</P>
<P>
To him, the history of mankind started along the Nile. He says Stone Age 
remains found in Nubian villages and the simplicity of the Nubian language 
proves that they are an ancient people. 
</P>
<P>
Their descendants, whose complexions are a shade darker than those of other 
Egyptians, still speak Nubian languages. They were peasant farmers little 
affected by the 20th Century until the early 1960s, when the Aswan High Dam was 
built. 
</P>
<P>
A dream of former President Gamal Abdel Nasser, the dam was built to supply the 
country with electricity and prevent annual floods along the Nile. A huge 
reservoir, named Lake Nasser, was created behind it. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, an international campaign was launched to rescue Nubia's Pharaonic 
remains, including the Temple of Abu Simbel and the Temple of Philae, which 
were moved above the flood waters. But the villages around the temples were 
lost, and some 50,000 people were moved north to new desert homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Gamal Abdel Nasser came to Abu Simbel and made a speech. And he asked the 
Nubians what they wanted. They told him we would like to be near the Nile," 
recalled Abdel-Rahman Hassan Gabr, a wizened old man in white robes and a white 
turban. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us: 'We know how you live and you will go to a village which is like 
where you live, only better,' " he added. 
</P>
<P>
When they arrived, the Nubians found that their new homes were half-built, 
without roofs and far from the river. 
</P>
<P>
Many people died from snake and scorpion bites. Some returned to their old 
villages to find only the tops of the palm trees above the water. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a shock. It was a big shock," Gabr said. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't believe a place like this could exist, a village with no greenery," 
an old woman said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years later, the Nubians, who number 100,000 in Egypt, have 
painstakingly recreated a kind of life, painting their houses and setting up 
seats outside for their traditional street life. They have resumed making their 
own Nubian bread, after years of relying on government-subsidized bread. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, some young men prefer to stay in the villages rather than join the 
teeming millions in Cairo. They have begun to invest in animals and farming. 
</P>
<P>
But they remain torn between the rival pulls of tradition and modern city life. 
They do not know whether to teach their children Arabic or Nubian. 
</P>
<P>
Many wonder if they should return to the shores of Lake Nasser to build new 
villages there, as Nubians from other villages have done. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who live here would like to go back to live near the Nile," said 
Gabr. 
</P>
<P>
"But we would have to leave this village, which is part of our lives too. They 
are willing to go there, but here is also a part of us. This is my home also."

"Suddenly there came a tapping, as if someone gently rapping, rapping at my 
chamber door." Yo. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar Allan Poe, meet Sylvester Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
Stallone took a detour during filming of "Rocky V" to visit the Edgar Allan Poe 
National Historic Site, a house where the poet and short-story writer lived for 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
Park ranger Joelle Wagner said last week that she answered a knock at the 
locked front door Feb. 12 to find the creator of movie hero Rocky Balboa on the 
doorstep with co-star Talia Shire and a bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
"I was flabbergasted," she said. "I had to take a few moments to compose 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
As the group toured the three-story structure, one of four houses Poe rented 
while living in Philadelphia from 1838 to 1844, Stallone told Wagner he had 
written a movie script about the author of the poem "The Raven." 
</P>
<P>
"He's just in awe of Poe," Wagner said. "He said he really admired him." 
</P>
<P>
Stallone, the lead in such action movies as "Rambo" and "Tango and Cash," did 
not say if he wanted to portray Poe, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Among Poe's works are "The Fall of the House of Usher," "The Black Cat," and 
"The Murders in the Rue Morgue," which established the mystery or detective 
short-story form.

DANUBE'S WILD DELTA SAVED BY UPRISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL RANK, REUTERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TULCEA, Romania 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The overthrow of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu has averted the 
destruction of one of Europe's last unspoiled wildernesses, the Danube delta. 
</P>
<P>
At this time of year the delta, which covers about 1,660 square miles, is a 
bleak and gray expanse of sodden marshland and lagoons punctuated by unique oak 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer, however, it comes alive with huge flocks of migratory birds, 
ranging from Dalmatian pelicans to Caspian terns that nest there. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu wanted to change that. Among the many grandiose plans he had for 
Romania was to drain the delta and transform it into fields of wheat and corn, 
using huge amounts of fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
"Ceausescu personally plotted the destruction of the delta," said Ananie 
Ivanov, chairman of the government ecology commission in the Danube port of 
Tulcea, gateway to the delta. 
</P>
<P>
"He planned to go ahead with the destruction as fast as possible but now his 
plans have been abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu, overthrown and executed in a popular uprising in December, also 
wanted large areas of the delta planted with figs. Why, nobody knows; figs do 
not grow well in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"After his initiative to plant figs was announced, fig trees were planted 
especially for him," Ivanov recalled. "They were watered for the occasion, but 
after that everyone forgot about them." 
</P>
<P>
Alexandru Rosu, professor of geography at Bucharest University and vice 
president of the recently founded Ecology Movement of Romania, said 20% of the 
delta had already been destroyed, but he was confident that the rest could be 
saved. 
</P>
<P>
He said a comprehensive conservation strategy was being formulated for the 
delta that would include plans to promote tourism, fishing and hunting under 
strict controls so as not to disturb the area's unique ecology. 
</P>
<P>
The plan must also resolve another problem -- how to control one of the main 
industries in the delta, the harvesting of reeds for papermaking. Rosu said it 
was not feasible to ban the cutting of reeds entirely, but it was necessary to 
place strict controls on the industry or the delta would be ruined. 
</P>
<P>
He said the area was seriously polluted with fertilizers and other chemicals, 
although this was not entirely Romania's fault. On its way to the Black Sea the 
Danube runs through eight countries, all of which have tended to use it as a 
sewer. 
</P>
<P>
Rosu, who suggests an international body be formed to tackle the problem, said 
that environmental safeguards hardly existed under Ceausescu, except on paper. 
</P>
<P>
"There were controls but fines were low," he said. "The most important thing 
was exports and in places where there were (anti-pollution) filters, factories 
did not use them because of the energy crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu geared production almost exclusively to exports and ordered Draconian 
cuts in energy consumption as part of his obsession with wiping out the 
country's $10-billion debt. 
</P>
<P>
Local officials said a bauxite smelter and ferrous metals plant in Tulcea 
caused serious air pollution, as did a sulfur factory in the Soviet border town 
of Izmail, 20 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
"We pollute them and they pollute us in their turn," said Dorian Dumitriu, 
secretary of the Tulcea branch of the Ecology Movement, who added that local 
ecologists now were making contact with their Soviet counterparts to try to 
tackle the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu's attitude to ecological problems was highlighted last November when 
Romania blocked a European agreement on the environment, saying it constituted 
unwarranted interference in its internal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
It ignored last-minute appeals from the Soviet Union at a conference in Sofia 
and was the only country to refuse to endorse the pact, thus blocking final 
agreement on the rights of the individual to a say in environmental affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Officials close to the new government admit that its environmental policies 
have not yet been worked out in any detail. But they are adamant that 
Ceausescu's total disregard for the environment is a thing of the past.

TECHNOLOGY IN SCHOOL IS MUSIC TO THEIR EARS

<TEXT>
<P>
For 10-year-old Trung Tran, the lack of a piano for practice at home is the 
only downside to the innovative new music class that he and his classmates take 
at Hardy Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
But that hasn't dimmed his enthusiasm for the weekly instruction in 
international song, musical rhythm and pattern on professional-quality 
synthesizers, as well as keyboard practice and songwriting. 
</P>
<P>
Tran has persuaded his father to take him each Saturday to the National City 
Fedco, where the fifth-grader busily practices the previous week's lessons on 
the store's musical instruments while his father shops. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the effect that the experimental course in music and creativity, now in 
its third month, is having at the small school near San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
Through philanthropist Muriel Gluck, Hardy Principal Gail Guth is tapping the 
talents of two local musicians, both to show the school's 328 students the 
creativity possible through music and to enhance their enjoyment of academics 
in general. 
</P>
<P>
The experimental program, if successful, could prove a potent example for a 
turnaround in elementary music education -- long neglected not only in San 
Diego but throughout the United States -- through a marriage of computer 
technology and a fresh new curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
Once a week, each class at Hardy -- from kindergarten through fifth grade -- 
files into the computer lab where musical artists-in-residence Carl Hermanns 
and Gary Stokes put the students through a fast-paced 40 minutes about music. 
</P>
<P>
Key to their efforts are the 17 Roland synthesizers, at which two students each 
can hear and make music from all over the world. The equipment, worth about 
$23,000 and protected in a specially secured classroom, is being rented for 
$432 a month. 
</P>
<P>
District fine arts education director Kay Wagner hired Hermanns and Stokes 
using a small portion of Gluck's $3.75-million grant and has funded the music 
project out of her own budget. As far as Wagner knows, no other district in the 
nation has designed an elementary program around keyboard synthesizers, which 
can replicate almost any kind of music through computer technology. 
</P>
<P>
Already, teachers at Hardy, who laud the program for motivating the children 
and for tying into language and science skills, are trying to interest 
businesses in their Montezuma Mesa neighborhood into providing an endowment so 
the class can become a permanent fixture. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real credit to Carl and Gary," teacher Art Geisler said. "Among other 
things, the kids learn how to listen." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, fourth- and fifth-grade students from Jack Shriver's class 
reviewed the way to find the middle C key on their keyboards and then practiced 
ensemble-style, using their index fingers, the playing of each white key four 
times from middle C to the next higher C key. As the students moved from key to 
key, Hermanns clapped his hands, steadily increasing the beat. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, you guys found out we didn't keep to a steady tempo," he said to wide 
smiles. "This time, feel the tempo with your feet as well." And the group 
busily tapped their feet as they ran their fingers up the keyboard a second 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Then Hermanns and Stokes showed them how to play using the entire hand, keeping 
the thumb flat on middle C while gently curling the four fingers onto the 
adjoining keys. As a prompt, Hermanns played a little segment of a Michael 
Jackson song to tempt them into experimenting with sharps and flats as well. 
</P>
<P>
"See, it's black, black, black, white, white," Hermanns said, splitting the 
class into red and yellow teams, letting one team practice, using earphones, 
while the other team learned the names of the keys -- from A through G -- and 
how to distinguish sharps and flats. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the class had listened to a Linda Ronstadt rendition of a Mexican love 
ballad, a recording on which her words were repeated to the same melody by a 
male singer accompanying her. 
</P>
<P>
"What does this remind us of?" Hermanns asked the students, with several 
recalling the African "response" songs they had heard the previous week. The 
class stood in a group and swayed from side to side, moving their feet to the 
beat of Ronstadt's mariachi band accompaniment while Hermanns pointed out 
Mexico on the wall map. 
</P>
<P>
"Beating out the rhythm with your feet is also a good way to (look natural) 
when you want to dance," Hermanns reminded them, as several students continued 
to sway to the beat as they returned to their desks. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Hermanns and Stokes explained the theory behind the class. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to show kids that music is a way to be creative, to be expressive, but 
also a way to boost self-esteem, and to affect other skills like math and 
reading as well," said Hermanns, who has conducted Summer Pops programs for the 
San Diego Symphony as well as coordinating its school concert programs. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids learn that they also need a strong framework, that discipline comes 
right along with freedom in music, that there is work to do, that you don't get 
immediate gratification all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Stokes told of one student who wanted to know what button on the synthesizer to 
press to hear the Michael Jackson rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized that she wanted not just the (background) sound but thought you 
could push a button and get the whole song done for you," Stokes said. 
</P>
<P>
Hermanns said the program deliberately emphasizes students' playing music first 
and then learning some of the reasons why the sounds develop the way they do. 
</P>
<P>
"While doing it, while playing a Michael Jackson chord, for example, I throw 
out the concept of tempo, so that they are learning naturally while doing. We 
make them concentrate for a while on a new idea, then letting them play around 
a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Hermanns and Stokes, a jazz musician by training, vary the curriculum slightly 
depending on grade level, giving students in lower grades more rhythm and song 
work and fewer concepts. 
</P>
<P>
The school's regular teachers are unanimous in their praise. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm teaching all my science through songs," said Irene Harris, who teaches 
fourth and fifth grades. "We sang songs about the thermometer, about the rain 
cycle and now we are singing about anatomy. . . . It beats giving them another 
work sheet." 
</P>
<P>
The students are sold on the class, and some persuaded their parents to buy 
small synthesizers as Christmas presents. 
</P>
<P>
"I like experimenting with the different sounds," fifth-grader Nathaniel Russ 
said, "especially the 'ironworks' sound, which sounds like a hammer and a 
nail." 
</P>
<P>
Tran said he notices now that basketballs and tennis balls "have a rhythm" when 
they bounce or when they are kicked. And Cassie Mahoney, a fourth-grader, said 
she has a better appreciation for the piano lessons her grandmother gives her 
on Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, I used to say, 'What is this?' " about the idea of lessons, Mahoney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Given the short duration of many experimental programs in the school district, 
Hardy teachers are apprehensive about whether the program will continue beyond 
its guarantee of one-year funding. The school is trying to find a "white 
knight" to guarantee the program by purchasing the equipment for $23,000 in 
return for having the computer lab named for the donor. 
</P>
<P>
"Wagner and Gluck have been extremely generous, but we don't want this to be at 
the whim of the district's priorities," Hermanns said, noting that music has 
not been high on the list of school trustees, despite evidence and testimony 
from teachers about the academic and social benefits from tackling the subject. 
</P>
<P>
"This program needs at least two years to prove its value, after which 
hopefully it would be permanent."

WATCHERS TRY POLISHING UP TAINTED 'JEWEL OF SAN DIEGO'; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: A GROUP CALLED BAYWATCHERS WORKS TO INFORM RESIDENTS AND 
BUSINESSES ON HOW TO HELP CLEAN UP POLLUTION IN SAN DIEGO BAY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Dave Sheehan decided to join the ranks of the flag-flying Baywatchers, he 
figured he should do it in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
After all, their 27-foot boat, the "Lil' Sucker," is a common sight on San 
Diego Bay, where he and his wife, Sam, run an oil-changing and recycling 
business (what Dave calls "a Jiffy Lube for boats"). Dave figured that, in a 
potentially messy business like theirs, it was important to make it clear where 
he stood. 
</P>
<P>
"I do carry hazardous waste and so far, knock on wood, I haven't spilled a 
drop," he said. "But I'm extremely visible on the bay, so every time there's 
some oil on the water, somebody points a finger at me." 
</P>
<P>
So the Sheehans became Baywatchers, joining the Environmental Health 
Coalition's Clean Bay Campaign to encourage bay users to become environmental 
watchdogs. And, instead of flying the campaign's official 1-foot "Clean 
Bay/Toxic Free" pennant, they had a 4-foot banner specially made to attract 
attention to what they believe is an urgent cause -- cleaning up San Diego Bay, 
one of the nation's most polluted waterways. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, the Sheehans say, the only finger-pointing they'll see now will be 
aimed at the blue flag atop their boat. "Ask Me About Baywatch," it commands. 
And those who do are likely to hear a tale. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Sheehan has his share of horror stories -- he's heard about more than one 
boat owner who has pumped big globs of black crud out of his bilges and into 
the bay. During two days earlier this month, he says, there were five 
diesel-fuel spills in the bay. And on any given day, he can point to the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
"See that floating there?" he asked, nodding toward the shiny residue floating 
near the dock in Point Loma where he keeps his boat. "That's diesel. And those 
black streaks in the water? Lube oil." 
</P>
<P>
After decades of receiving boating wastes, industrial emissions and urban 
runoff from storm drains, the bay is full of potent pollutants, including heavy 
metals such as lead and mercury, pesticides like DDT and other toxins, such as 
PCBs. According to the Environmental Health Coalition, these concentrated 
pollutants have created several "toxic hot spots" -- some of them among the 
worst toxic deposits in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, the Clean Bay Campaign has fought for improvements, focusing its 
efforts on lobbying the San Diego Unified Port District and the Regional Water 
Quality Control Board, which are responsible for protecting the bay's 
well-being. But, until the creation of Baywatch, the campaign had no formal way 
for people like the Sheehans to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
Now, for a $10 fee, San Diegans interested in cleaning up, restoring and 
protecting the bay can purchase a Baywatch kit, complete with a pennant and 
how-to guide for preventing and reporting toxic spills, both on the bay and 
upstream. 
</P>
<P>
Membership is not limited to boaters. Much of what causes the bay's pollution, 
campaign organizers stress, is on shore: petroleum products, pesticides, 
cleansers and other toxics that are dumped into storm drains that flow into the 
bay. 
</P>
<P>
"Baywatch is all about people taking back this public waterway and being able 
to make full use of it," said Jay Powell, the Environmental Health Coalition's 
program coordinator. "Let's keep toxics out of the gutter. And let's stop using 
products that will harm the bay. We want to make it fishable and swimmable." 
</P>
<P>
Before that goal is reached, however, there is a long way to go. Several state 
and federal studies based on samples of fish caught in the bay have found the 
pollution to be severe, causing reproductive, physiological and behavioral 
disorders in bay life. The health risk to consumers of bay shellfish and other 
fish is being evaluated by San Diego County, which is scheduled to complete the 
first draft of an 18-month, $284,000-study in March. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the results, Dave Sheehan won't be baiting his hook. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what's on the bottom down there," he said. "Yeah, we're getting more 
environmentally aware. But our grandfathers didn't know, and they didn't care." 
</P>
<P>
The history of dumping in the bay is a long and colorful one. Before the Point 
Loma Waste-water Treatment Plant was built in the 1960s, raw sewage was 
channeled into the bay, causing visible pollution. After the sewage was 
diverted to the plant, the bay once again regained its picture-postcard image 
as "The Jewel of San Diego." But, in recent years, a less visible form of 
pollution has been discovered in the sediment that sit on the bay's bottom: 
high levels of toxic chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Industry, from shipyards to aeronautical and defense firms, is responsible for 
much of the contamination. In 1988, for example, the regional water board fined 
Teledyne Ryan Aeronautics for discharging cancer-causing polychlorinated 
biphenyls, or PCBs, from its transformers into storm drains leading to the bay 
at Convair Lagoon. The company is now investigating appropriate cleanup levels 
and will report to the board in March. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, however, according to the State Mussel Watch program's studies 
of toxics in mussel tissues, Convair Lagoon has the highest recorded levels of 
PCBs on the West Coast. And, because PCBs do not break down quickly, that is 
not likely to change until a cleanup is begun. 
</P>
<P>
Although these forces are beyond the reach of most Baywatchers, campaign 
organizers hope that instead of being discouraged by the scope of the problem, 
volunteers will work to set an example -- for other individuals and for 
businesses as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, it's not within an individual's power to clean up all the toxins in 
the bay," said Diane Takvorian, executive director of the Environmental Health 
Coalition. "What Baywatchers are doing is precisely what industry ought to be 
doing: taking the bull by the horns." 
</P>
<P>
The idea behind Baywatch is not new. Maryland's privately funded Chesapeake Bay 
Foundation has a 5-year-old Baywatchers group whose 5,000 members interpret the 
name broadly: as well as keeping their eyes on the water, they have been known 
to lobby their legislators and build hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Sherman, the director of the foundation's grass-roots program, said a big 
part of his job is reminding people how development on land affects pollution 
in the bay. 
</P>
<P>
"People who dump their used motor oil down the drain just think it goes away. 
It doesn't. It goes into the bay," Sherman said. "Whether you live in San Diego 
or Baltimore, the care you take when you change the oil in your car, the amount 
of fertilizer you use in your garden, all these things will affect the quality 
of your water resource." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Callison, president of Seattle's Puget Sound Alliance, agrees. She has 
received $36,000 from Washington state to create its first Sound Keeper 
program. Like similar programs in New York state, Callison's program will hire 
a full-time advocate for the waterway, called a Sound Keeper, who will be 
responsible for the stewardship of the sound. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Sound Keeper will be a citizen ombudsperson, the eyes and ears of the 
public and a lightning rod for complaints," Callison said. "We need to have 
somebody who really stands at the helm, but we're going to focus on creating a 
network, a Puget Sound environmental navy." 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Nichols of the Puget Sound Water Quality Authority, the state agency that 
is funding the Sound Keeper program, said the goal is to educate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's public awareness that will prevent pollution from getting into the water 
in the first place," she said. "You can do something about pollution because 
you're out there, and you see it. All you have to do is know whom to call." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Baywatcher's Guide is full of phone numbers: the Coast Guard, the 
Harbor Police, the county hazardous materials management division. It is also 
brimming with ideas about how to get involved. Fourth-, fifth- and 
sixth-graders can help stem urban runoff, the guide says, by painting storm 
drains with a duck and the message "No Dumping: I Live Downstream." Adults can 
be more discriminating at the checkout counter, according to the guide, by 
buying nontoxic cleaning and garden products. 
</P>
<P>
And anyone can participate in Earth Day on the Bay on April 21, the eve of the 
20th anniversary of Earth Day. A "Clean the Bay Boat Parade" of several hundred 
vessels will travel from Shelter Island to the Coronado Bay Bridge and back 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Gillet, a Baywatcher who usually keeps an eye on the bay from the seat of 
his kayak, said he is selling Baywatch kits at his Point Loma store, Ecomarine 
Ocean Kayaking.

PUBLIC RELATIONS BLITZ STAGED FOR THE RITZ; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: AT DINNER MEETINGS, REPRESENTATIVES TRY TO PERSUADE RANCHO PALOS 
VERDES RESIDENTS TO BACK BARRY HON'S RITZ CARLTON DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a Wednesday night high in the hills of Rancho Palos Verdes and Marion 
Ruth, microphone in hand, is stumping for a developer hoping to build a tony 
Ritz Carlton resort on the city's coastline. 
</P>
<P>
"We want you to leave here as our goodwill ambassadors," she tells 65 or so of 
her neighbors, who have been invited to a private home to learn about builder 
Barry Hon's proposed resort and to dine on a buffet dinner of Parmesan chicken 
and sauteed zucchini. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after the Orange County developer's aide, Peter Herman, has delivered 
his spiel and answered audience questions, Ruth proselytizes the group, urging 
them to contact City Council members and voice support for the resort. 
</P>
<P>
"We must get in touch with every councilman, not once, but twice!" said Ruth, a 
local real estate agent who believes the hotel will be an asset to the city. 
</P>
<P>
So it goes in the public relations blitz launched by Hon to win the hearts and 
minds of residents and city officials for the 450-room Ritz Carlton he wants to 
build on one of the last large, undeveloped pieces of land along the coveted 
Los Angeles County coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Besides staging dinner parties to enlist support for his project, Hon, through 
his company, Palos Verdes Land Holdings Co., is working to assemble a large 
group of residents to lobby for the resort. He also has given thousands of 
dollars to local cultural and charitable groups. 
</P>
<P>
"The days you go and just blow something through (City Hall) are long past, I 
believe," Herman said. 
</P>
<P>
But Hon's tactics don't sit well with Councilman Robert Ryan. Hon's version of 
the American Dream, Ryan asserts, is to "try to buy his way into town." 
</P>
<P>
"He is appealing to our elite," Ryan said. "And when you get these people at 
dinner parties, they say he must be nice because he's got clean fingernails." 
</P>
<P>
On a smaller scale, Hon's public relations tactics are also being used in the 
city by the Monaghan Co. The Arizona-based company, which wants to build a 
495-room hotel and 80 homes on the site of the former Marineland aquatic park, 
has hired a public relations firm and put together its own citizens group to 
lend support to its project. 
</P>
<P>
And the Zuckerman Building Co. of Los Angeles, a family-owned firm that has 
built many Palos Verdes Peninsula homes, has signed up its own public relations 
firm, mainly to wage war against Hon. 
</P>
<P>
Hon would like to acquire 140 acres of Zuckerman property for a golf course and 
homes next to the hotel. The Zuckermans, who are opposed to the hotel, want to 
put their own housing development on their land. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always taken the position we had to level the playing field with the 
big guys," Peggy Zuckerman said. 
</P>
<P>
All this activity comes at a time when the city's environmentalists and others 
have expressed fear that the community, particularly the coastline, is being 
threatened by overdevelopment. During last fall's City Council election, the 
two hotel projects were the main topic of political debate, and they have 
continued to be. 
</P>
<P>
Even though both hotel projects are still in the early planning stages, some 
residents in recent weeks have urged council members that the city's voters 
should ultimately decide how the coastline should be developed. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people who live here came here because of the semi-rural 
environment," said Alan Carlan, a longtime resident who ran unsuccessfully for 
a council seat last November on a platform that called for public preservation 
of the city's coastal land. 
</P>
<P>
Hon, who in 1987 became the city's largest landholder when he acquired about 
850 acres in various parts of the city, began his bid to win public support for 
a Ritz Carlton at the urging of some council members. 
</P>
<P>
Since zoning for hotels was not considered when city officials zoned the 
coastal area, the council encouraged him to "take his show on the road" to test 
public sentiment, according to Councilwoman Jacki Bacharach. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish that task, Hon has heavily relied on Herman. Before joining Hon's 
company as a vice president for special projects, Herman was on the staff of 
Orange County Supervisor Thomas Riley, assigned to work with developers and 
community groups. 
</P>
<P>
"In my last job, I felt full disclosure by the development industry was the 
right way to go, and that is what we are doing in this project," Herman said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 30 months, Herman estimates that he has met with at least 50 
neighborhood associations and other community groups to explain the Ritz 
project. Shortly after last fall's election, he hired Peggy Lambie, a 14-year 
resident of Rancho Palos Verdes who is active in numerous local organizations, 
to assist him. One area where she has been invaluable, Herman says, has been in 
introducing him to the city's "opinion leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Although he did not have a precise figure, Herman said the company has 
contributed perhaps as much as $15,000 to various city groups, including the 
Peninsula Education Foundation, the Norris Theatre and an organization that 
raises money to support shelters and other programs for the homeless. Herman 
defends the contributions, saying Hon typically makes them in cities where he 
has projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Our company and the Ritz Carlton both have a long and documentable legacy of 
being involved in community activities," Herman said. "We think it is right and 
proper to be involved in community groups." 
</P>
<P>
Both Herman and Hon say a major thrust of the public relations campaign is to 
get supporters of the resort complex to make their feelings known to city 
officials. Besides urging them to attend public hearings and speak on behalf of 
the project, supporters are also being urged to write letters to council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately for us, the people who are in favor are not strident, 
shrill-voiced people," Hon said, referring to the critics of development who 
often speak at City Council meetings. "If you measure the decibel level, we 
don't always come out on top." 
</P>
<P>
Hon has been selling the resort on the basis that it would be an architectural 
gem built in a Northern Italian motif. There would also be public tennis courts 
and an 18-hole golf course, as well as an extensive network of public trails 
and parks and ocean viewing areas. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how many people may support Hon's proposed resort, Cathy Manning, a 
local environmentalist who has spoken out against what she considers excessive 
development, said most people living on the peninsula simply do not favor any 
large-scale projects. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of people are very strongly against the level of development 
currently contemplated," Manning said, referring both to Hon's project and 
Monaghan's proposed hotel. "There is no way the majority of people are with 
Barry Hon." 
</P>
<P>
The idea to hold dinner parties was Marion Ruth's. Ruth, who owns a real estate 
firm, said she decided that the parties would be a good way to reach out to 
those who might support the resort and get them involved. 
</P>
<P>
Despite fears voiced by some critics that the resort will increase traffic 
woes, Ruth said she does not believe that will happen because traffic to and 
from resorts is not heavy during peak hours. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth also said the resort would provide the city with a five-star hotel 
complete with fine restaurants and a place to hold weddings, receptions and 
meetings. At present, local residents sometimes have to travel far outside the 
community to find such amenities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Several people who attended the Wednesday night dinner echoed those sentiments. 
As they sipped cocktails, they mulled over a model of the project that was 
about the size of a large dining room table, inspecting its architecture and 
the layout of the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
One guest, Ann Wonder, said she had a "few ambivalent feelings," and was 
worried that the resort might increase traffic on peninsula roads. Another, 
Cindy Chew, a Rolling Hills Estates resident, said she could support the hotel 
providing that Hon makes good on his promise to allow public access to the golf 
course as well as the tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a package," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lambie said afterward that of those who were invited, there were only seven 
no-shows, and four of those people were ill. Other dinners have been scheduled 
throughout March, she said, adding that she has no problem finding willing 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
"I actually have a waiting list of people," she said.

VOTE ON MOBIL'S USE OF CHEMICAL DRAWS WIDESPREAD INTEREST; 
</P>
<P>
TORRANCE: THE MARCH 6 BALLOT MEASURE TO STOP MOBIL FROM USING HYDROFLUORIC ACID 
HAS SPARKED STATE AND NATIONAL ATTENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN and JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<P>
In an election March 6 that will test whether Torrance residents have lost 
faith in the safety of Mobil Oil Corp.'s refinery, voters will say whether the 
plant must eliminate the use of acutely hazardous hydrofluoric acid there. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual measure would limit key technology at the refinery and could cost 
the oil giant up to $100 million to convert to a less volatile process. The 
measure would bar Mobil, which typically has 29,000 gallons of hydrofluoric 
acid on hand, from storing more than 250 gallons at its plant. 
</P>
<P>
The election has drawn the attention of lawmakers in Congress and the 
California Legislature, as well as the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District, the oil refining industry and the environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
It pits critics in Torrance against the nation's fifth-largest industrial 
corporation. The initiative campaign has split the seven-member City Council 
and set a local record for campaign spending. Mobil so far has spent more than 
$360,000, dwarfing the previous record of $46,000 and far outstripping the 
measure's backers, who have spent about $7,600. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Dan Walker is the sponsor of the measure and the only council member 
supporting it. Nevertheless, Mayor Katy Geissert and three other council 
members who oppose the initiative, said in interviews last week that they favor 
a ban on hydrofluoric acid. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, who gathered the 10,000 signatures that qualified the initiative for 
the ballot, said the Torrance vote will affect other governmental agencies 
considering similar hydrofluoric acid bans. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are high. 
</P>
<P>
Walker and other proponents of the measure cite industry-sponsored spill tests 
to argue that a major release of the chemical, which is used to boost the 
octane of unleaded gasoline, could kill more people than the Bhopal methyl 
isocyanate gas release at a Union Carbide plant in India, in which more than 
3,000 people died in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In the ballot argument and in speeches, proponents say that federal 
investigations show that human error by Mobil employees has contributed to a 
series of accidents at the refinery, demonstrating that it is foolish to rely 
on Mobil to ensure the safety of the hundreds of thousands of people living 
near plant. 
</P>
<P>
Walker and Torrance resident Bernie Hollander, a retired chemical engineer, 
argue that Mobil opposes the measure because it does not want to spend $100 
million to convert to less volatile sulfuric acid, which other refineries use 
in the same process. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil says that a major release of hydrofluoric acid is extremely unlikely and 
that beefed-up safety measures would enable the refinery to control any 
reasonably foreseeable accident without endangering the public. The oil company 
adds that switching to sulfuric acid would dramatically increase the likelihood 
of a transportation accident involving sulfuric acid. 
</P>
<P>
In identical Feb. 17 letters to their Torrance neighbors, refinery employees 
John Berryhill and Paul Pepper attacked Walker's backing of the initiative. The 
letters called it a "grab for publicity by an ambitious politician who wants to 
take advantage of people's fears." Mobil's campaign committee is identified as 
the sponsor of the letters. 
</P>
<P>
The election has created an odd, three-sided political contest in the city 
among Mobil, Walker and the other six members of the council. 
</P>
<P>
The entire council supported a lawsuit against Mobil that attacks the 
refinery's safety record and Mobil's use of hydrofluoric acid. The suit seeks 
enhanced regulatory power over the refinery, possibly including a ban on 
hydrofluoric acid. It was filed last April after Walker had started his 
signature campaign and after he had criticized his council colleagues for 
inaction in pursuing safety improvements at Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
As the election nears, lawyers for the city have uncovered increasing evidence 
that human error played a contributing role in a series of accidents at Mobil. 
The findings strengthened council resolve to push the lawsuit against Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, Walker's boast that the council would not have acted 
without his prodding has infuriated his council colleagues. Their hostility 
prompted them to join Mobil in opposing Walker's initiative. It also got them 
to put on the ballot a second measure that would allow the city to raise taxes 
to pay for legal costs if the ban succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
The council members argue that Mobil would prolong the city's lawsuit if the 
hydrofluoric ban passed, forcing the city to spend millions of dollars in legal 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
Despite opposing Walker's ballot measure, Geissert and council members Bill 
Applegate, Tim Mock and Dee Hardison said last week that they favor what it 
could accomplish -- banning the use of hydrofluoric acid at the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
"We can all agree that it is a substance we would rather not have used in large 
quantities in our city," Geissert said. 
</P>
<P>
The two other council members have less clear-cut positions: George Nakano said 
last week he favors a ban on hydrofluoric acid or stricter controls. Mark Wirth 
said he opposes a ban now but might change his mind if the AQMD comes out in 
favor of one. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that sulfuric acid is a safer alternative, the AQMD staff has favored 
the elimination of hydrofluoric acid at four refineries using the substance -- 
Mobil, Ultramar in Wilmington, and the Golden West and Powerine refineries in 
Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The staff will forward its recommendation to the AQMD board in several months, 
along with a report from a task force of industry and public safety agency 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Hydrofluoric acid turns to hydrogen fluoride gas at room temperatures. Tests 
show that 1,000 gallons spilled in two minutes could form a dense, 
ground-hugging cloud of vapors that could be fatal up to five miles downwind. 
By contrast, sulfuric acid must reach 518 degrees Fahrenheit before it 
vaporizes. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD Deputy Executive Director Ed Camarena said in an interview that AQMD's 
action will not depend on the outcome of the election in Torrance, although he 
is watching it closely. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials add that Mobil could eliminate any transportation risk for 
sulfuric acid by building a sulfuric acid manufacturing plant at its refinery 
or by piping the acid in. 
</P>
<P>
Sulfuric acid plants are now in operation at the Chevron refinery in El Segundo 
and the Unocal refinery in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
"We think (Mobil) could build a plant in compliance with the air quality 
regulations," Camarena said. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD also has asked Rhone-Poulenc Basic Chemicals Co., the area's main 
commercial manufacturer of sulfuric acid, to see whether an existing pipeline 
could be used to transport sulfuric acid from Carson to the Mobil refinery. The 
Rhone-Poulenc plant, formerly operated by Stauffer Chemical Co., uses pipelines 
to supply the Arco and Shell refineries in Carson with sulfuric acid. 
</P>
<P>
If Mobil decides to truck in the sulfuric acid, an AQMD analysis says it would 
take 10 25-ton truckloads of sulfuric acid a day to supply the refinery, said 
Rhone-Poulenc manager Peter Jurichko. 
</P>
<P>
This figure appears to be far less than what Mobil has said. Mobil spokesman 
Tom Collins said last week it would take 125 trucks a day. The refinery 
currently receives two trucks a month of hydrofluoric acid. 
</P>
<P>
Also looking at the March 6 vote is Assemblyman Curtis Tucker Jr. 
(D-Inglewood), who introduced a bill Feb. 12 that would ban the bulk use of 
hydrofluoric acid in all populated areas of the state. 
</P>
<P>
"If I lived in Torrance, I would definitely vote for" the initiative, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the initiative wins, "it helps my cause" because it "helps show to people 
that there is a fear out there of this definitely dangerous chemical and that a 
group of people decided to do something about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), who has had his staff working 
on possible legislation on hydrofluoric acid for months, said he is watching 
the Torrance election as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely interested in how voters will respond," he said. "I have 
already come to the conclusion that hydrofluoric acid is deadly serious and 
needs to be dealt with at the federal level." 
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's chief 
research and lobbying arm, also is paying attention to the Torrance vote. 
</P>
<P>
Del Persinger, API senior refining associate, said that an API policy statement 
will address hydrofluoric acid in a nationwide context. It will say that "with 
safety measures and proper plant design . . . we don't have to have legislative 
or regulatory limits on the use of hydrofluoric acid in refining." 
</P>
<P>
On the environmental side, Fred Millar of Friends of the Earth and the 
Environmental Policy Institute said that the Torrance measure is probably the 
most important local election issue in the country in terms of providing 
residents the opportunity to deal with an extremely hazardous facility. 
</P>
<P>
"Since California tends to be the cutting edge of a lot of environmental 
issues, everyone around the country will be watching to see whether a facility 
that poses a Bhopal-type hazard to the community will be forced to change to a 
safer chemical," he said.

Doctors are not the only ones issuing prescriptions for cancer patients at 
Presbyterian Hospital. The patients themselves can order up a dose of 
Dangerfield, or a Marx Brothers booster, from the Laugh Mobile. 
</P>

"It's a real pick-me-up," said Wanda Mooers, who has been battling cancer of 
the lymph nodes for more than 14 months. "You can pick out things -- even 
Play-Doh and crayons -- to take your mind off your problems." 
</P>
<P>
Every Monday and Friday, volunteers wheel the 5-foot-tall yellow cart around 
Presbyterian's seventh-floor cancer unit. It holds about 35 videotapes, ranging 
from "National Lampoon's Animal House" to "The Three Stooges" to TV sitcoms and 
performances by comedians such as Rodney Dangerfield, as well as humorous books 
and audiotapes and games -- even Slinky toys. 
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to it," said Mooers, the mother of two young sons. "When you're 
going through chemotherapy and radiation, you need to put yourself in a good 
state of mind, which is sometimes difficult to do." 
</P>
<P>
"It gives them some diversion while they're in the hospital," said Sherry 
Bargoil, cancer control program coordinator. "Medically speaking, we know there 
is some mind-body connection." 
</P>
<P>
In his book, "Anatomy of An Illness," Norman Cousins wrote: "Even if we find 
that laughter produces no specific biochemical changes, it does accomplish one 
very essential purpose: It tends to help a person cope with apprehension and 
even panic that all too frequently accompany serious illness." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials got the idea after talking with patients, Bargoil said. 
"Some of our younger leukemia patients who were staying with us for long 
periods began bringing in their own VCRs and renting tapes. We began to think, 
'Why can't we do something like this?' "

TRANSIT PANEL NEARS CROSSROADS OVER EAST-WEST RAIL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those predicting that the fierce debate over San Fernando Valley rail options 
will go on forever might gain ammunition at a key transit meeting this week. Or 
they might finally be proved wrong. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission is scheduled to 
choose one of three east-west rail plans for the Valley that have survived more 
than three years of contentious study and political maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
They are a westward extension of the downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro Rail 
subway to the San Diego Freeway, a light-rail line in a shallow trench from 
North Hollywood to Warner Center and an elevated monorail or magnetic 
levitation system on the south shoulder of the Ventura Freeway from Universal 
City to Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
Both the light-rail line and the Metro Rail extension would make use of the 
Southern Pacific railroad freight right of way that crosses the Valley roughly 
parallel to Chandler and Victory boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
There is only scattered opposition to the subway extension, the clear favorite 
of the three since it emerged nine months ago as a compromise between 
long-feuding homeowners and business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't ensure it will prevail. The 11 commissioners have come under 
intense pressure from county Supervisor Mike Antonovich, the lone monorail 
proponent, and might delay a final decision, as they have at earlier stages of 
the route-selection process. 
</P>
<P>
Subway advocates warn that if the commission opts for a delay while the freeway 
monorail plan gets additional study because of last-minute changes -- aimed at 
making monorail cheaper and sharply lowering the number of houses to be 
demolished -- the Valley might lose its place in line for the county's next 
rail project. 
</P>
<P>
Because commissioners are scheduled in March to pick the next rail system to be 
built in the county, there may be little time to spare in finalizing the Valley 
route. The other rail project candidates are a downtown-to-Pasadena light-rail 
line and a northward extension -- from El Segundo to Marina del Rey -- of the 
under-construction Century Freeway light-rail line. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the commission's rail money is committed to three lines already under 
construction: Metro Rail in the downtown area and the Century Freeway and Long 
Beach-Los Angeles light-rail lines. Commission members say they can authorize 
construction on only one more line in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Several commissioners have acknowledged privately that the Valley's political 
clout is sufficient to ensure that it will get the next line, provided it can 
show a united front on behalf of a single route. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of money for more than one project and the time crunch has led 
proponents to criticize Antonovich for what they view as imperiling the 
Valley's chance for a line that many feel is essential by the year 2000 to 
relieve worsening congestion on the Ventura Freeway and other east-west 
thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich, who represents the bulk of the Valley and who contends that only a 
futuristic monorail or magnetic levitation line will lure motorists from their 
cars, has continued to express confidence that the commission will agree to a 
delay. 
</P>
<P>
He notes that the commission might not know for a month or two how much money 
it will have for the county's fourth rail project, and thus cannot make any 
route decisions until then. 
</P>
<P>
As a further inducement to delay, Antonovich got county supervisors three weeks 
ago to place an advisory referendum on the June 5 ballot in which voters will 
be asked to choose one of the three Valley options or vote for no rail line at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman, who represents a portion of the southeast Valley, is 
among those warning that any delay "might ruin the Valley's chances to get a 
rail system for years to come." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of last week, Antonovich's transportation deputy, Rosa Kortizya, 
gave the first hint that the supervisor might back away from insisting on a 
delay so that additional monorail studies can be finished. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are changing every day, and we are constantly testing our support," 
Kortizya said Friday. "We intend to be realistic about this. But as of right 
now, we are not abandoning the monorail plan." 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that commissioners pushing for the Pasadena or Marina del Rey 
lines "have an interest in seeing the Valley not ready when the decision is 
made, and we don't intend to play into their hands." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leading proponents of the subway extension across the East Valley 
remain confident that their broad coalition will prevail. 
</P>
<P>
Roger L. Stanard, a Warner Center attorney who co-chairs the Campaign for 
Valley Rail Transit, said "our support is so broad that I don't see how they 
can delay a decision," which he said "could be fatal to the Valley's chances." 
He described Antonovich as "essentially a one-man campaign, albeit a powerful 
one-man campaign, for a technology that hasn't sparked much interest in the 
year or so since it was first proposed." 
</P>
<P>
The subway extension, first proposed by state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) and 
Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude, was a compromise between feuding 
groups that appeared to be on the verge of jettisoning any chance for a Valley 
line. 
</P>
<P>
In embracing the Metro Rail extension, business leaders agreed to put off for 
now their goal of a rail line that would reach all the way to Warner Center. 
Instead, they hope that express buses will close the gap between the end of the 
Metro Rail line at the San Diego Freeway and Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
And leaders of homeowner groups, who had fiercely opposed any line that 
intruded into single-family areas, agreed to allow stations in residential 
areas along the Chandler-Victory right of way and to put up with at least four 
years of noisy and dusty tunneling. 
</P>
<P>
The third alternative -- a light rail in a shallow trench along the 
Chandler-Victory route -- has been a commission staff favorite through the 
three-year study of Valley rail options. 
</P>
<P>
Such a light-rail system could be built from North Hollywood to Warner Center, 
a distance of 14.1 miles, for $1.1 billion, according to the recently completed 
environmental impact report on Valley rail alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the Robbins-Braude subway extension would cost $1.1 billion for 
5.6 miles of rail. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich's 16.5-mile monorail plan carries a $1.8-billion price tag. 
</P>
<P>
Although many homeowner leaders have endorsed the subway extension, some remain 
opposed, predicting that the commission will seize the opportunity to designate 
the Chandler-Victory route, then announce several years from now that more 
detailed engineering studies show that there is only enough money to build a 
ground-level line. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a faction headed by Gerald A. Silver has emerged in recent months to 
oppose all rail systems as too costly. 
</P>
<P>
"These systems are a boondoggle," said Silver, president of Homeowners of 
Encino. "They cost way more than advocates say, and they never come close to 
meeting ridership projections." 
</P>
<P>
Silver and others instead urge expansion of the regional bus system.

LACK OF FUNDS HURTS COASTAL PANEL, ANALYST SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: THE LEGISLATURE IS TOLD THAT A SHORTAGE OF MONEY AND PERSONNEL IS 
HURTING THE COASTAL COMMISSION'S ABILITY TO PROTECT THE COASTLINE.

<P>
The mission of the California Coastal Commission to protect the state's 
coastline is being hampered by a lack of money and personnel, said Elizabeth 
Hill, state legislative analyst. 
</P>
<P>
"Our analysis indicates that the commission has significantly fewer resources 
to devote to regulatory activities today than it did eight years ago," Hill 
told the Legislature last week. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, the Legislature's nonpartisan budget adviser, made the comments as part 
of her review of the $53.7-billion state budget proposed for the 1990-91 fiscal 
year by Gov. George Deukmejian, who has held office for seven of those eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
When adjusted for inflation, Hill said, the commission's proposed $6.2-million 
budget is actually $2 million less than it was in 1982-83. And she noted that 
the commission's work force has been cut from 170 to 110 in the last eight 
years, a 35% reduction. 
</P>
<P>
Hill painted a grim picture of commission operations, including delays in 
certifying local coastal programs, a backlog of potential violations that need 
to be investigated and a high volume of work per staff member. 
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for Deukmejian defended the governor's tight-fisted approach 
toward the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Beermann, the governor's deputy press secretary, said Deukmejian, a 
longtime critic of the commission, would still like to see the commission 
abolished. 
</P>
<P>
"He believes that decisions affecting land use along the coast should be 
carried out by those individuals who are directly responsible to the electorate 
in that area," Beermann said. "And the Coastal Commission is not responsible to 
the electorate." 
</P>
<P>
Planners have pointed to a noticeable strain on resources in the commission's 
office in Long Beach, the governor's hometown. It is the busiest of the Coastal 
Commission offices and oversees coastal development in Los Angeles and Orange 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
"Our (building) permit load has increased from about 800 five years ago to more 
than 1,200 a year now; at the same time the number of staff planners has been 
reduced from 13 to nine," said Gary Timm, a planner in the Long Beach office. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach office has vacancies for two planners, but officials say the 
jobs are difficult to fill because qualified candidates, mindful of the 
commission's endangered status, are hesitant to apply for a job that may not 
last. 
</P>
<P>
Such staff shortages have left the commission vulnerable to criticism, both 
from developers, who complain about delays in their projects being approved, 
and environmentalists and slow-growth advocates, who say some projects drag on 
so long that it is difficult to sustain opposition. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to personnel shortages, commission staffers complain of a lack of 
modern office equipment. For example, at the panel's San Francisco 
headquarters, workers still use a rotary phone system that frequently breaks 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"It got to the point where I finally just bought my own touch telephone at the 
office," said Jack Liebster, the agency's public information officer. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, the telephone problem will be relieved because the commission is 
expected to relocate its main office this spring. But the commission will have 
to absorb at least $200,000 annually for increased rent, "effectively resulting 
in another reduction in funds," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, none of the commission's permit application files are accessible by 
computer, meaning that staffers and the public must search through index cards 
for information on any of the thousands of commission actions over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Although a 1983 amendment to the state Coastal Act called for the creation of a 
Coastal Resource Information Center, which would be a computerized system 
tracking coastal development, staffers say the Legislature never allocated 
funds for it. "Even if we could afford to develop the software, there's no 
money to buy hardware," said Jim Burns, the agency's chief deputy director. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's report on the conditions facing the commission met with a mixed reaction 
from lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Several Democrats welcomed her assessment but said that until a new governor is 
elected in November there is not much that can be done to boost the 
commission's budget. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) predicted that whoever becomes 
governor will do a better job than Deukmejian of protecting the coastline. "I 
don't think anyone can do worse for the coast," Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
But Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro) maintained that the commission 
has exceeded the scope of its original authority -- preserving access to the 
coast. He said many of the commission's activities, such as monitoring oil 
spills, were never envisioned for the panel. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had stuck to what they were originally formed to do, their budget and 
staff is adequate," Felando maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Steve MacElvaine of Morro Bay, a Deukmejian appointee to the panel, said the 
commission was set up to certify local coastal programs and then turn over 
permitting of projects and enforcement to local authorities. MacElvaine, saying 
he was speaking just for himself and not the commission, said the reason for 
the work backlog is that local city coastal programs have not been completed. 
</P>
<P>
MacElvaine contended that much of the staff's time is occupied with dealing 
with permits for grading in the Santa Monica Mountains and the construction of 
tennis courts or decks. But, he said, if local governments had completed their 
own coastal plans, these decisions would usually be heard by local authorities 
and not the commission.

SURVEY ON MALIBU CITYHOOD ATTACKED AS BIASED; 
</P>
<P>
PARTISANSHIP: SUPPORTERS OF INCORPORATION SAY THE TELEPHONE POLL RAISED "BOGUS 
ISSUES" IN AN EFFORT TO SWAY RESIDENTS. 
</P>

<P>
Officials of a group that supports Malibu cityhood reacted angrily to a phone 
survey concerning incorporation that they say is a thinly disguised "propaganda 
instrument" by opponents of cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an obvious attempt to use innuendo and misinformation to sow doubts about 
cityhood in the community," said Walt Keller, co-chairman of the Malibu 
Committee for Incorporation, regarding the survey conducted by a Santa Monica 
research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Maullin of Fairbank, Bregman &amp; Maullin, the firm that conducted the 
survey, declined to discuss the survey or to identify who authorized it, saying 
that his client "prefers confidentiality in the matter." 
</P>
<P>
Several Malibu residents who participated in the survey said telephone 
interviewers identified themselves as representing "F, B and M" and said they 
were calling from Las Vegas. Maullin said the firm used operators in Las Vegas 
to make the calls. 
</P>
<P>
Keller and his organization co-chair, Carolyn Van Horn, blasted the survey as 
the work of "anti-cityhood forces" intent on waging a campaign at the ballot 
box now that a Malibu cityhood election in the near future appears increasingly 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
Van Horn said the survey contained loaded questions that were "intended to 
serve as a scare tactic" in relation to potential voters in a Malibu 
incorporation election. 
</P>
<P>
She labeled as "bogus issues" questions included in the survey regarding 
increased taxes, and accused the survey of insinuating that a new city could be 
unduly influenced by special interests. 
</P>
<P>
Among the questions asked by the survey was, "If you found out that your local 
property-tax bill would increase by $5,000 if Malibu became a city, to pay for 
local services such as adequate sewer channeling, would you vote yes in favor 
of creating a new city, or no?" 
</P>
<P>
The survey also asked participants to respond to several common assertions 
about cityhood, both pro and con, as well as to indicate a favorable or 
unfavorable response to about 20 community leaders known for their views on 
cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
A judge last month ordered the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to stop 
delaying a long-sought incorporation election, clearing the way for the 
election to be held in June. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs gave the supervisors until Tuesday to 
conclude a hearing on cityhood, which the supervisors had indefinitely 
postponed in November. The hearing, required by law so proponents and opponents 
of cityhood have a public forum for their views, represents the final step that 
must be completed before an election date can be set. 
</P>
<P>
The county is expected to appeal the decision, in which case it may be left to 
an appellate judge as to whether an election occurs in June or is delayed 
further, awaiting the outcome of an appeal.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: REAGAN 'BOOM' JUST A LOT OF NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. GORDON, DAVID M. GORDON is professor of economics at the New School 
for Social Research in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The propaganda machines continue to roll out their celebrations of the 
robustness and vitality of the U.S. economy. Here is another in my efforts to 
provide at least a partial corrective. I focus this time on a recent effusion 
on the New York Times Op-Ed page, a piece titled "The Reagan Boom -- Greatest 
Ever" by Martin Anderson, former domestic adviser to the one-time actor and 
former President. 
</P>
<P>
With all his hyperbole, Anderson sounds more like a circus barker than an 
economic analyst. He characterizes the "Great Expansion of the 1980s" or 
"Reagan's Great Expansion" as "the greatest, consistent burst of economic 
activity ever seen in the U.S. In fact, it was the greatest economic expansion 
the world has ever seen -- in any country, at any time. . . . If we look at the 
sheer size and immensity of it, at its scope and power, then it cannot be 
denied that this expansion was the greatest." 
</P>
<P>
Among several indicators of greatness, Anderson concentrates on two main 
achievements of the long economic expansion beginning in late 1982: the 
cumulative growth in employment and output that continued for seven years, 
until late 1989. His claims about these particular successes -- to put it a 
little bluntly -- are downright silly. 
</P>
<P>
On the employment front, Anderson advertises the cumulative creation of 18.7 
million new jobs as "a world record: Never before had so many jobs been created 
during a comparable time period." But looking at the absolute scale of new 
employment makes little sense as a measure of an economy's robustness since the 
volume of job generation depends substantially upon the scale of the economy. 
If a 1% annual increase in employment in China resulted in as many as 5 million 
new jobs, would we argue that its economy was growing more robustly than the 
U.S. economy in which a 2.6% annual increase in 1986-87 generated "only" 2.8 
million new jobs? Claims of greatness should focus, in other words, on growth 
relative to the previous size of the economy, not the absolute volume of the 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
And here Anderson's claims dissolve. 
</P>
<P>
Civilian employment, the aggregate upon which Anderson appears to be basing his 
assertions, grew by 18.9% in the seven years of expansion. By comparison, it 
grew by 19.7% in the seven years from late 1970 to late 1977. (Have you ever 
heard anyone refer to the "Great Nixon-Ford-Carter Expansion?") And it grew by 
21.1% in only four years from 1933 to 1937. Do we really want to herald the 
health of the U.S. economy in the middle of the Great Depression? 
</P>
<P>
Or, since Anderson claims a world record, we might look elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Civilian employment grew in the seven years from 1950 to 1957 by 20% in Japan 
and by 19.1% in Germany. Shouldn't Germany and Japan be allowed at least a 
share of the title? Or check out this example: Employment in Germany grew by 
46.7% in the five years from 1932 to 1937, 2 1/2 times more rapidly than during 
Anderson's seven magical years. Wasn't economic life fabulous as the Nazis 
prepared for global conquest? 
</P>
<P>
The same kinds of problems apply to Anderson's advertisements about the 
cumulative growth of aggregate output. He cumulates the annual levels of gross 
national product, or GNP, for the seven years from 1983 through 1989, totaling 
"some $30 trillion worth of goods and services." 
</P>
<P>
In this case he not only ignores the problem of relative (versus absolute) 
growth, but he also doesn't even correct for inflation, using figures for 
nominal rather than real GNP. Once we correct for inflation and the scale of 
the economy, average real GNP during Anderson's effervescent expansion was 18% 
higher than it had been in 1982. By contrast, average real GNP during the seven 
years from 1963 through 1969 was 21% higher than it had been in 1962. To which 
interval of seven years would you provisionally accord the "world record?" 
</P>
<P>
How might we more sensibly assess U.S. economic performance during the 1980s? 
</P>
<P>
A first guideline can help us avoid pitfalls such as overrating employment 
expansion during the mid-1930s. We should look at the economic record for an 
entire business cycle, not merely its expansion, since part of the health of 
the recent expansion merely reflected a rebound from the devastating recession 
of 1980-82 (just as the apparently impressive employment expansion from 1933 to 
1937 pales considerably alongside the precipitous drop from 1929 to 1932). 
</P>
<P>
By this standard, we should look at the full business cycle from 1979 to 1989 
to assess the impact of conservative economic policies. Let's look first at a 
comparison to our own past, concentrating on two crucial measures: the average 
rate of growth of real GNP and the average pace of investment. 
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1989, real GNP grew at an annual (compound) rate of 2.6%. During 
the long boom from 1948 to 1966, the corresponding growth rate was 3.8%. During 
the cycle from 1966 to 1973, it was 3.1%. During the 1973-79 "stagflationary" 
cycle, it was 2.5%. So, during the much celebrated Reagan cycle, real GNP 
growth was as stagnant as during the previous, much reviled Ford-Carter cycle 
and only two-thirds as rapid as during the long postwar expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The record for the pace of investment was at least as bad. 
</P>
<P>
The average rate of growth of the real net productive capital stock, a measure 
of how much we're expanding our productive stock of plant and equipment over 
time, reached 4.4% a year in the Vietnam-fueled 1966-73 cycle, dropped to 3.5% 
in 1973-79 and dropped again to 2.7% in the Reagan cycle. Should we rank this 
the best business cycle in history if its pace of accumulation averaged only 
60% of the rate achieved during the postwar expansion? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps these comparisons are unfair. Perhaps the global economic climate 
during the 1980s inexorably condemned any individual country to relative 
economic torpor when compared to its own past. We might therefore compare the 
U.S. economy during the 1980s to the six other largest advanced capitalist 
economies: Japan, West Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Canada. 
The conservatives promised to revive productivity growth in the United States. 
But if we look at comparative rates of productivity growth from 1979 to 1988, 
the United States ranked seventh among the largest capitalist economies. Dead 
last. 
</P>
<P>
The conservatives also promised to rev up investment to fuel our engines of 
growth. But if we look at the economy's relative investment performance, 
comparing the share of gross domestic product going into gross non-residential 
investment, the U.S. economy again limps across the finish line behind all six 
of the others. 
</P>
<P>
In short, judged on either of these two tests, the U.S. economy during the 
1980s flunks decisively. 
</P>
<P>
I don't call this the "greatest economic expansion the world has ever seen." I 
call it a limp and faltering economy in need of immediate rescue from the 
ravages of right-wing economic policies.

NORDSTROM 'GUILTY' OF REWARDING INITIATIVE, BUT OTHERS ALSO REQUIRE WORK 'OFF 
THE CLOCK' 
</P>

Shame on Nordstrom for telling its sales associates to pursue their 
entrepreneurial instincts and act as if they actually owned the business ("The 
Other Nordstrom," Feb. 4)! Shame on Nordstrom for honoring those who thrive in 
such an environment by giving them the opportunity to sell more and earn more, 
to avail themselves of enviable merchandise discounts and to aspire to 
increased responsibilities thanks to a strictly enforced promote-from-within 
policy! And shame on Nordstrom for fostering middle management autonomy! 
</P>
<P>
Guilty, I say. 
</P>
<P>
As fitting punishment, let's demand that Nordstrom eliminate the title sales 
associate and replace it with sales clerk. This way we can all hire nothing but 
C-minus people and pay them uniformly for every hour worked. Besides, how else 
can we ensure that Nordstrom will fall into line with the rest of the herd 
leading us to the promised land where mediocrity forever reigns supreme?

Working "off-the-clock" is not unique to Nordstrom. I was often required to 
complete a task but told to punch out first while working at May Co. 
</P>
<P>
I was even encouraged to come in on my day off to finish assignments or 
projects gratis. That was nearly 12 years ago. I see little has changed in the 
industry.

Your article on Nordstrom gave me cause to smile. Having worked at Bullocks 
several years ago, the scenario described was very similar. 
</P>
<P>
We were never told to work extra hours, but it was very clear that you were 
expected to clock out at your regular hour and then return to the selling floor 
for another four hours or come in early and then clock in at your regular time. 
This boosted your selling quota considerably, thereby making you one of the 
so-called good sellers. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody complained then, I guess, because we were young and needed the job. I'm 
glad to see the practice uncovered.

ALICE KAHN: GOING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IN WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE KAHN, Alice Kahn's new book, Luncheon at the Cafe Ridiculous, has just 
been released by Poseidon Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"What are they doing in California now?" everyone in Washington, D.C., asked 
me. "They" are those crazy people, those nuts, those sun-dried, brain-damaged, 
new-aged, left-coastal loonies. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, no one in our nation's capital bats an eye when GQ, the leading 
men's fashion rag, shows one of Washington's movers and shakers out in a boat 
with a babe -- not in his tailored suit, but in his birthday suit. 
</P>
<P>
Washington is a puritan town. It is a place of deep closets and thinly 
suppressed desires. It is a town where men in conservative suits have the most 
outrageous secret sex lives. 
</P>
<P>
A National Public Radio producer there, a native Californian, told me that when 
he went home, an old buddy from high school asked him, "So what do you do for 
fun?" 
</P>
<P>
The producer said, "I didn't know what to say. No one at a party in Washington 
would ever bring up fun. They'd ask how work was going." 
</P>
<P>
I was in Washington on a book promotion tour. "So, Alice, tell us about the 
latest crazy fads in California," the talk show host asked (as if a blackened 
redfish never floated ashore on Capitol Hill). 
</P>
<P>
"Alice, what's with the men out there?" another talk-show host asked me. 
</P>
<P>
"You mean, why are they so good at football and baseball?" I responded. That 
wasn't what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to ask him, "What's with the men here in Washington?" You read so much 
about what goes on behind closed doors. Why do they all look like Brooks 
Brothers clones? And so do the women. There's not a black leather skirt within 
the Beltway. 
</P>
<P>
To see what evils lurk, I decide to open some doors. I go to Washington's YMCA 
health club. There are -- count 'em -- seven full floors of state-of-the-art 
exercise equipment in the dramatic glass-and-brick building. I take an elevator 
to the jogging tier. We're not in California now, Toto! 
</P>
<P>
At 7 a.m. on a work day, the joint is jumping. Literally. Like Alice in 
Wonderland, I walk through and open each door gingerly. 
</P>
<P>
Behind one, rows of people are bicycling to nowhere while reading the papers. 
Behind another, people are rowing no boat ashore while trying to keep up with 
the computerized pacer boat. On another floor, behind another door, people are 
stair-climbing to nowhere and stationary-walking there, too. 
</P>
<P>
There are weight-training rooms of various ability levels. In one, a woman 
stands alone blowing out her cheeks and pumping up her pects. "Close the door!" 
she yells at me. I obey. Who am I to mess with the Powerbar-hungry? 
</P>
<P>
Below the rowing deck, beyond the handball, racquetball and squash courts, is 
an aerobics class, and people are jumping to nowhere in a no-nonsense class. No 
Spandex. No hair mousse. No smiling. A hard-working workout. 
</P>
<P>
On the jogging tier, I follow a man in a "Miss Porter's" T-shirt. A sign of 
liberation? A reminder of the private school payments that get him up this 
early? He's in the fast lane to nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
I work my way through more floors of agony and open more doors to the panting, 
grunting, pumping corridors of Washington power. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, I return to the women's locker room and try not to stare as a tense 
young woman hangs up her herringbone coat with the velvet collar. She removes 
her gray, double-breasted suit, her teal silk blouse, her smart gold jewelry 
and paisley handkerchief accessories. 
</P>
<P>
She stands there in her purple see-through bra, matching bikinis and garter 
belt, carefully hanging her clothes so nothing will wrinkle. Next, she locks 
her Victoria's Secret lingerie in her locker. 
</P>
<P>
Then she climbs on a purple, glowing table, lies down and pulls a lid over her 
entire body like a compliant popover in a bun-warmer. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that a tanning machine?" I ask another woman. She nods yes. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, it's crazy out there on the mid-Atlantic coast!

SEX EDUCATION DEPENDS ON SPECIFICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Neil Solomon's column on Jan. 26 was a demonstration of how physician 
unresponsiveness contributes to the spread of the AIDS virus and other sexually 
transmitted diseases (and pregnancies). 
</P>
<P>
A writer asked Dr. Solomon for specifics on safe sex for a 14-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of giving the information that was requested, he replied that 
abstinence was appropriate and "a 14-year-old should not have to struggle with 
the erroneous assumption that it's normal to have sex." 
</P>
<P>
No information was given about condoms and spermicides. No referral was given 
to a local AIDS agency. He merely added that adolescents "should know the facts 
about sex, contraceptives, sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy." The 
writer had complained about prior vague comments and requested specific advice. 
None was given. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Dr. Solomon ignored the fact that some 14-year-olds do have sex. 
Further, he confirmed that many physicians demonstrate no responsibility to 
provide specific information on low risk sex for those who do decide to become 
sexually active. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder our teen-agers remain at high risk.

SNOWBOARDING ADVICE: 'SKIP THE SENSATIONAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'd like to make a suggestion to staff writer Bob Sipchen and the Los Angeles 
Times' editorial staff: The next time you wish to publicize the growing new 
sport of snowboarding ("The Wild Bunch," Feb. 2), skip the sensational 
editorial dramatics in the opening paragraphs. Does Sipchen really believe that 
equally shocking stories about reckless skiers could not be recited by any ski 
area employee? Instructor Frank Kilduff, who tells the story, is even quoted 
later as saying that he believes there are more reckless skiers than 
snowboarders. 
</P>
<P>
I don't understand why an article that proceeds to detail the popularity and 
growing acceptance of the sport is prefaced with a shocking and 
unrepresentative scenario in which "Lucifer's fallen henchmen," deafened by 
"hyper-manic heavy-metal music," use "wobbly little children as slalom poles." 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of ski area operators have been completely satisfied with 
their decision to allow snowboarding at their resorts, and the new sport has 
thus far posed no threat whatsoever to skiers.

SIMON COLUMN STRUCK A FAMILIAR NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roger Simon's Feb. 4 column ("Some Notes for Audiences on the Fine Art of 
Criticizing Artists") embodied some unfortunately common feelings of nonartists 
observing modern art -- a lack of confidence in knowing what one likes and a 
lack of the vocabulary to share what one sees. 
</P>
<P>
The tone of his article reinforced the inferior feelings that untrained 
observers are conditioned to feel around art they don't immediately understand. 
</P>
<P>
There is no faux pas in asking a painter, "Why is this part of your piece this 
way?" just as in asking a writer, "What did you mean when you wrote . . . ?" 
Art is open to countless interpretations by the viewers, and often the viewer 
pleasantly surprises the artist in what he or she finds in the work.

ROGER SIMON: TECHNOLOGICAL QUICK FIX HAS UNADVERTISED COST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commercial begins with the woman entering her comfortable living room. She 
is blond, 30-ish, attractive and dressed in a bathrobe. 
</P>
<P>
The phone is ringing and she walks over and picks it up. As she does, we see 
that she is wearing matching wedding and engagement rings, simple and elegant 
like the woman herself. 
</P>
<P>
TV ads are very adept in their use of symbols. In just a few seconds we know a 
lot about this woman: She is mature and well-off and in the security of her 
home, but that bathrobe also makes her look very vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
She picks up the phone and says hello. The person on the other end does not 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
Now, we see him. He is round-faced, wearing round, wire-rimmed glasses. He 
looks surprisingly ordinary and respectable. 
</P>
<P>
"Who is this?" the woman asks, a faint note of annoyance in her voice. "Who is 
this, please?" 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the man speaks. He speaks in a voice of quiet, almost playful, menace. 
"Why don't you guess?" he says. 
</P>
<P>
The woman knows what to do. She pushes a button on a strange box that we now 
see is attached to her phone. Instantly a number appears. It is the number of 
the caller. 
</P>
<P>
The woman reads his number to him. "How's that?" she says, triumphant. "Close 
enough?" 
</P>
<P>
Then we hear a voice-over telling us that if we buy this new service from the 
phone company, "it can help you stop harassing calls." 
</P>
<P>
The commercial, as we have come to expect from phone companies, is extremely 
well done. The terror -- the woman alone in her house, wearing a bathrobe, 
thinking she is safe -- is controlled yet very real. 
</P>
<P>
And the ordinariness of the caller is very clever. In its own way, the phone 
company is using Hannah Arendt's famous concept about "the banality of evil." 
The phone company is saying that the people who terrorize us can look very 
respectable. They can be the guy standing next to you at the department store 
counter who hears you give your phone number when you charge something, the man 
in the insurance office. Or your neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Evil people lurk everywhere and we are not safe from them even in our homes. So 
we must buy this device! 
</P>
<P>
And, like most commercials, it leaves practical matters aside. Such as: What 
does the woman in the bathrobe do next? Call the police? And what does she tell 
them? That a man has called from such and such a number and has said, "Why 
don't you guess?" Is that a crime? 
</P>
<P>
The commercial does not trouble about such things. It offers a technological 
quick fix: You press a button on a box and your troubles disappear. 
</P>
<P>
The box, which costs $60 to $80 plus about $6.50 per month, is called "Caller 
ID," and it eventually will be available across America. 
</P>
<P>
Some areas already have it. And the phone company portrays it as always being 
for the public good: It catches the bad guys, the heavy breathers, the obscene 
callers. 
</P>
<P>
But others have raised serious objections to Caller ID. The Wall Street Journal 
gave the example of Eileen Hahm, a New Jersey social worker, who counsels 
disturbed, sometimes violent, patients. When she calls a client, she does not 
want that client to know her home number. 
</P>
<P>
It's a reasonable concern. And those who have non-published numbers, pay extra 
for it. But Caller ID reveals non-published numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The phone company makes money both ways: It sells a service (an non-published 
number) and then sells a service that negates the first service (Caller ID). 
</P>
<P>
The phone company says it is acting in the public good, helping to stop crank 
calls and false alarms. But it is also doing more. 
</P>
<P>
Large companies have their own form of this service. Every time you call 
certain stores or businesses, your number is recorded and put in the company's 
computer for future marketing. The company can then call you at home and pepper 
you with sales pitches. And it can sell your number to others. 
</P>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, MCI Communications and US Sprint 
Communications sell caller identification to businesses. And the seven regional 
Bell companies are trying to get people to buy Caller ID for their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Some people, including consumer and civil liberties groups, are not all that 
pleased. They say whistle-blowing will stop. They say a person will be 
reluctant to call for confidential medical help or call a suicide hot line or 
call to report a neighbor for child abuse if their identities will be revealed 
through a phone number. 
</P>
<P>
And in Maryland, a bill is pending before the state Legislature to block 
numbers from appearing on the Caller ID machines. 
</P>
<P>
The phone company can do that. But the phone company does not want to do it. 
"Do we outlaw the peephole in the door?" a spokesman for Chesapeake &amp; 
Potomac Telephone said. 
</P>
<P>
The staff of the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission strongly opposed 
Caller ID last year, calling it a form of wire tapping. The commission approved 
it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
In America, we never say no to technology. We never say no to "progress." 
</P>
<P>
The woman in the bathrobe is now safe in her home. She is secure in her 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Until she picks up the phone and makes a call.

HISTORIC CHURCH RISING FROM ASHES IN NEW SANCTUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A little more than five years after fire destroyed the historic First 
Presbyterian Church, members of the congregation will gather at 3 p.m. today 
for a worship service to dedicate a new sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. R. Scott Sullender, the pastor, said banners have been prepared 
proclaiming: "New Sanctuary . . . New Management . . . Same Lord." 
</P>
<P>
The new sanctuary on Holt Avenue at Gibbs Street replaces a church and bell 
tower that were constructed in 1907 and burned to the ground in an electrical 
fire Feb. 1, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Thompson, assistant chairman of the sanctuary building committee, said the 
fire lighted up the sky, drawing parishioners and other spectators from miles 
away. 
</P>
<P>
As church members watched the destruction, Thompson said: "Everyone was numb 
and awe-struck. It was spectacular." Thompson, 71, had been attending the 
church since he was 4. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Honaker, 84, a member of the congregation since 1929, said he was at home 
in Pomona when someone called and said: "Your church is burning down." Honaker 
said he raced to the scene in time to witness a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
The old church was connected by a second-story pedestrian bridge to a Christian 
education building that housed church offices, Sunday school classrooms and a 
gymnasium. The fire was about to spread from the church to the education 
building, Honaker said, when "a breeze from the southwest came up and stopped 
it. We had a miracle here." 
</P>
<P>
The preservation of the education building, which was constructed in 1930, 
permitted the church to continue Sunday services without interruption. The 
services have been held in the gymnasium, with the congregation seated in metal 
folding chairs facing a cross. The gym floor was carpeted, but the room still 
has basketball backboards at each end. 
</P>
<P>
The new sanctuary, which cost $1.2 million, is a modern brick structure with 
seven sides, curved walls and a distinctive roof line. It will seat more than 
300 people. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who worked on the building project with John Guthrie, the building 
committee chairman, said construction has taken more than 1 1/2 years because 
the church elected to save money by managing the project itself rather than 
hiring a general contractor. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. James Baird, who grew up in the Pomona church and has served as pastor 
of several Presbyterian churches in California and Colorado, will speak at the 
dedication service. The church's music groups will be augmented by choirs from 
other churches. 
</P>
<P>
The First Presbyterian Church was founded in 1883, making it one of the first 
churches in Pomona. It had as many as 1,300 members 60 years ago, but now has 
290.

From a dry spillway near the Santa Fe Dam Recreational Area, Don Provine 
surveyed a most improbable site for an 18-hole, public golf course. 
</P>
<P>
Before him lay a 250-acre rectangle of rocky, semi-desert terrain, filled with 
coastal sage scrub, clumps of bushes, a few trees and a string of power 
transmission lines. Traffic churned along the San Gabriel River (605) Freeway. 
Bisecting the scene was a concrete dam built to stem the tide of rainwaters, 
which on rare occasions cascade from the San Gabriel Mountains. The mountain 
range formed an impressive vista to the north. 
</P>
<P>
"A golf course would dress up the area quite a bit," said the 51-year-old, 
gray-haired Provine, whose relaxed manner suits his title of assistant golf 
director for the County of Los Angeles Department of Parks and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone has the same view of what a $6-million golf course would mean 
for the Santa Fe Dam and Flood Control Basin, which sprawls alongside the 605 
and Foothill Freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials say the site is the most valuable land in the San Gabriel 
Valley for use as "spreading grounds," where rain runoff is collected and 
pumped into the porous earth to replenish the water table that provides 90% of 
the water for 1 million people. The spreading grounds occupy not only the site 
of the proposed golf course, but also hundreds of acres in and around the 
county's Santa Fe Dam Recreation Area, east of the 605 Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"If this golf course goes through, we will lose half of our best spreading 
grounds," said Robert G. Berlien, general manager of the Upper San Gabriel 
Municipal Water District. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Nichols, division chief of hydrology and water conservation in the 
county's Department of Public Works, conjured up another possible obstacle to 
the golf course: torrential rains. "I can just see guys with 8 o'clock starting 
times getting washed away one day." 
</P>
<P>
Mainly, however, water agency officials fear that a golf course would reduce 
the amount of water that seeps into the water table and would limit 
authorities' ability to capture significant amounts of water during flood 
times. They say it also would preclude use of the land as a temporary storage 
place for surplus water. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm prejudiced toward water and am not a golfer. But even if I was a golfer, I 
think I would understand. It's obvious that is not a good location for a golf 
course," said Al Wittig, board member of the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal 
Water District. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the owner of the land, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, has made no 
decision. The county Parks and Recreation Department first proposed the idea 
informally several years ago when the corps began to review its master plan for 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
The corps, having built the dam and flood control basin in 1948, issues permits 
for activities around the dam, including flood control, recreation and water 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Mary A. O'Keeffe, a public affairs spokeswoman for the corps' Los Angeles 
office, said a golf course may be a suitable addition to the flood control 
basin. But, she said: "We wouldn't make any kind of comment until we have 
evaluated the proposal." 
</P>
<P>
Despite opposition from local water officials and the Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California, parks and recreation officials say they intend 
to submit a formal proposal in hopes that the project could be completed within 
the next few years. They have the backing of county Supervisor Pete Schabarum, 
whose district encompasses the recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum and parks and recreation officials maintain that a golf course would 
in no way jeopardize water conservation or flood control efforts. And they 
point out that a new course would supplement the shortage of available public 
links in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The county's existing 20 courses, even those in the worst shape, get extensive 
use, Provine said. Nearly one-third of the courses are in the San Gabriel 
Valley, with facilities in Altadena, Pasadena, Diamond Bar, Pomona, La Verne, 
Arcadia and at Whittier Narrows. They are all operating at capacity, Provine 
said, noting that 250 to 300 golfers daily account for 100,000 rounds annually 
at most courses. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Harvey, chief of contracts for the county's Parks and Recreation 
Department, added: "We're running out of land to put golf courses on." A 
regulation course requires a minimum of 140 acres. In Los Angeles County, where 
land prices and availability are at a premium, it is not easy to find new golf 
sites, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum aide Judy Hammond said the county understands the importance of the 
spreading grounds. She pointed out that it made $3.5 million in improvements to 
expand the Santa Fe spreading grounds east of the proposed course site last 
year. "It's unfortunate that the (water officials) did not have the facts on 
this before taking a position against the golf course," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, one local water official, H. William Robinson of the Upper San 
Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, said it's a potential environmental 
catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
The Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster, the agency which oversees water pumping 
rights, will file a lawsuit if the proposal isn't dropped, said watermaster 
board Chairman Linn Magoffin 
</P>
<P>
Dick Wulfing, the county regional park superintendent at the Santa Fe Dam 
Recreational Area, said he knows of no significant environmental reasons for 
which a golf course couldn't be built at the site. However, he said, the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service has recommended that further studies of the site's 
biological resources be undertaken prior to a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
But water conservation concerns are at the heart of the objections. "We're all 
quite concerned," said Nichols, of the county Department of Public Works. 
"We're in an era of ever-diminishing water supplies. This golf course would 
impinge on this." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed site normally is dry, but water officials said it has flooded in 
extremely wet years. 
</P>
<P>
And new plans by the Metropolitan Water District call for more extensive use of 
the spreading grounds, even in dry years. The district wants to import water in 
the winter, when demands are lower and wholesale prices are cheaper, then pump 
it into the water table for summer retrieval. 
</P>
<P>
The golf advocates discount the notion of floodwaters washing the course away 
and stand ready to defend the proposal's aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically we would be doing away with the rock-look and replacing it with 
grass. So I don't know what the water people are so concerned about," Provine 
said. "I like the natural look, too. It's not that we'd be doing away with it 
totally." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents note one irony, though: A golf course is a water hog. It requires 
constant irrigation and in this case would be atop a porous landscape 
considered increasingly valuable in terms of water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Provine has another point of view. The hundreds of thousands of gallons of 
water it would take to green the course each year would seep into the water 
table. "We'd probably be helping in that we'd be buying water and putting it 
back in the ground."

Not too many years ago, a public school lunch meant a foil-covered tray 
containing a culinary delight such as chicken fried steak, a sloppy joe, or 
meat loaf with gloppy brown gravy. Off to the side would be some wilted carrot 
sticks, half of a canned peach and a piece of chocolate cake or gingerbread. 
</P>
<P>
Times have changed. The salad days are here. School cafeterias are revamping 
their offerings to promote health and better eating habits in children. That, 
school officials hope, will mean better digestion and increased attention spans 
now and fewer clogged arteries in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica-Malibu school district is introducing salad bars this year. 
The Culver City schools did so last year. And throughout the Westside, school 
food service directors are implementing an array of tactics designed to 
discourage junk food consumption and steer students toward healthier, more 
balanced lunches. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Education, meanwhile, plans to issue a set of 
recommended standards this spring for the fat, cholesterol and other 
nutritional content of school lunches. In anticipation of the state guidelines, 
Beverly Hills, Culver City, Santa Monica-Malibu, Los Angeles and other school 
districts in Southern California jointly applied last week for a $300,000, 
three-year state grant that would establish a regional network to publicize the 
nutritional guidelines and improve instruction about proper eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills schools have been pioneers on the healthy eating front. With 
funds provided by the Neil Konheim Foundation, the Beverly Hills Unified School 
District six years ago instituted a comprehensive nutrition education program 
called Health Champions. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the curriculum, first-graders in Maureen Winicke's class at Beverly 
Vista Elementary School on a recent day chanted: "Every time I take a bite, I 
choose a heart-healthy delight." They then proceeded to name and classify an 
assortment of less desirable foods -- potato latkes, candy, ice cream, bacon -- 
that were high in sugar, salt or fat. 
</P>
<P>
The Health Champions program also provides cholesterol, blood pressure and 
other health screening tests, workbooks and songs about nutrition, and salad 
bars in the cafeterias. The Konheim Foundation started a similar program this 
year in Santa Monica's Will Rogers Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
The health kick has even meant new looks for stark cafeterias. Potted plants 
and smaller tables reduce the institutional feel of the cafeterias, food 
service directors say. Music systems serenade the youngsters with what Kit 
Dreyfuss, Health Champions coordinator for the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified 
School District, describes as "child-oriented Muzak," The goal, Dreyfuss said, 
is to have the children "eat slower, digest better, and then go out to play all 
refreshed, instead of cramming down their food and running out." 
</P>
<P>
Compared to a decade ago, school menus generally have less sugar, salt, fat and 
cholesterol and more whole wheat products, fresh produce and fiber. Elementary 
school students are served more chef salads and fewer corn dogs. 
</P>
<P>
At the cafeteria serving Culver City Middle School and Culver City High, for 
example, sweets such as brownies, cinnamon rolls and cake, which had been sold 
a la carte, were eliminated this year. Other high-fat or high-salt items that 
used to be offered a la carte -- nachos, chili, pizza -- are now only sold 
together with salad, fruit and milk. No longer can a student fashion a lunch of 
chocolate cake, french fries and a soft drink, said Marie Boland, food service 
supervisor. "We kind of forced them into a complete, (balanced) lunch." 
</P>
<P>
There is no guarantee, of course, that the students will actually eat the 
healthier foods, but food services officials say the overall strategy is to try 
to bend students' preferences. 
</P>
<P>
Younger children in particular still go for spaghetti and tacos, said Lisa 
Chambers, Beverly Hills food service director. "They're very basic eaters -- 
they're not willing to try a lot of new things or out of the ordinary 
(things)." 
</P>
<P>
At Beverly Hills schools' salad bars, the items rival that of restaurants: 
garbanzo beans, red cabbage, broccoli, trail mix, potato and macaroni salads, 
tuna, cottage cheese, grated mozzarella, beets, carrots, canned green beans, 
cauliflower, prunes and muffins. The salad bar, offered every day last year, 
was cut to two days a week at the elementary schools this year because of lack 
of sales, Chambers said. On the days it is available, however, about half of 
the lunch-buyers choose the salad, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Salad is faring better in the upper grades. Culver City middle and high school 
students, who got a salad bar installed late last school year, give it rave 
reviews. Seventh-graders Susi Riederer and Akemi Taylor say they choose the 
salad "because it tastes good," not necessarily because they're 
health-conscious. 
</P>
<P>
At Beverly Hills High School, the daily salad bar, offered for the past five 
years, is still doing well, Chambers said. About 400 students, or 20% of the 
student body, frequent the salad bar each day, downing, among other things, 24 
heads of lettuce and five pounds of cottage cheese. Salad bar regulars, 
however, complain about getting the same offerings day after day and say the 
vegetables could be fresher. Yas Yadegar, 15, said that she waits to eat salad 
at home, where she can throw in feta cheese, olive oil and sun-dried tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
"The salad bar is not one of their star selections," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the salad at Beverly Hills High faces fierce competition from a 
dizzying array of hamburgers, pizza, enchiladas, made-to order sandwiches, 
frozen yogurt, trail mix and brownies, touted at stations with neon signs. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Culver City students can sidle up to separate windows for the salad 
bar -- or for pizza, nachos, chili, chicken nuggets, baked potatoes, sandwiches 
and hamburgers, accompanied by fresh fruit, salad, milk, french fries or 
muffins. The burger lunch sells at a rate of about 450 a day, while the salad 
bar and the other lunch variations lag at about 100 each, Food Services 
Director Sue Koehnen said. 
</P>
<P>
There are several holdouts against the health tide. The cafeteria at Beverly 
Hills High still sells Winchell's doughnuts. Culver City schools still have 
sour cream and croissants. Los Angeles schools still offer the peanut-butter 
coffee cake, brownies and German chocolate cake. 
</P>
<P>
It is pointless to "put a menu out that the kids won't buy," noted Culver 
City's Koehnen. "They have to have a little bit of choice, so they feel like 
they're treated like grown-ups," added Koehnen's associate, Boland. 
</P>
<P>
One almost sacrosanct item is french fries. At all Los Angeles schools and at 
elementary schools in Westside districts, frozen manufactured fries are simply 
warmed up in cafeteria ovens -- and are lower in fat and oil as a result. But 
largely because of student demand, the fries are still deep-fried at high 
schools in Culver City, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica. "Just like McDonald's," 
several high school students proclaimed happily. 
</P>
<P>
"To change the product, I think we'd see a drop of participation," said Beverly 
Hills Food Service Director Chambers. "Students at that age know how to make 
the right choice. If they know deep-fried french fries are bad for them, then 
they'll know they should take salad or fruit (instead)." 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn McCary, the Health Champions program consultant in Beverly Hills, says 
she regularly urges Chambers' staff to cut the potatoes thicker so they'll 
absorb less oil. At Culver City middle and high schools this year, salad or 
muffins replaced french fries in several of the lunch combinations. As a 
result, the cafeteria goes through about 130 pounds of french fries a day, 
compared to 450 pounds a day last year, Boland said. 
</P>
<P>
The dietitians have other tactics. In Los Angeles schools, unbreaded, 
charbroiled chicken strips are offered alongside the more popular fried Chicken 
McNugget-style pieces. Beverly Hills High serves Granny Goose potato chips with 
half the salt of conventional brands and Spree "all-natural" sodas. Culver City 
will experiment with offering whipped cottage cheese instead of sour cream on 
baked potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
The reviews from students are mixed. Generally, they say they want lower 
prices, better quality and, perhaps most important, variety. 
</P>
<P>
Salad bars, for example, were a well-received innovation when they were 
introduced at some Los Angeles high schools 10 years ago. But patronage 
dwindled to the point where most have now been dropped. Carol Noelting, deputy 
food service director, says they became passe. Beverly Hills and Culver City 
students likewise say they're getting bored with an array of lunch choices that 
doesn't change. 
</P>
<P>
And though they agree the menus are healthier, many students crave some grease 
and salt. 
</P>
<P>
A survey last month found that Beverly Hills High School students don't want 
the natural Spree soda. "They want Coke, Pepsi -- real soda," Chambers said. 
They don't want the reduced-salt chips, "they want the salty ones." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, the Culver City seventh-grader, likes the new salad and deli bars, but 
longs for tacos, that were dropped from the menu this year. "The grease would 
drip down my arm," she said of the tacos, but "they were pretty good."

SHORTAGES HURT COASTAL PANEL, ANALYST SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: THE LEGISLATURE IS TOLD THAT A LACK OF FUNDS AND PERSONNEL IS HAMPERING 
THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION IN PROTECTING THE COASTLINE.

<P>
The mission of the California Coastal Commission to protect the state's 
coastline is being hampered by a lack of money and manpower, said Elizabeth 
Hill, state legislative analyst. 
</P>
<P>
"Our analysis indicates that the commission has significantly fewer resources 
to devote to regulatory activities today than it did eight years ago," Hill 
told the Legislature last week. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, the Legislature's nonpartisan budget adviser, made the comments as part 
of her review of the $53.7-billion state budget proposed for the 1990-91 fiscal 
year by Gov. George Deukmejian, who has held office for seven of those eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
When adjusted for inflation, Hill said, the commission's proposed $6.2-million 
budget is actually $2 million less than it was in 1982-83. And she noted that 
the commission's work force has been cut from 170 to 110 in the last eight 
years, a 35% reduction. 
</P>
<P>
Hill painted a grim picture of commission operations, including delays in 
certifying local coastal programs, a backlog of potential violations that need 
to be investigated and a high volume of work per staff member. 
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for Deukmejian defended the governor's tight-fisted approach 
toward the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Beermann, the governor's deputy press secretary, said Deukmejian, a 
longtime critic of the commission, would still like to see the commission 
abolished. 
</P>
<P>
"He believes that decisions affecting land use along the coast should be 
carried out by those individuals who are directly responsible to the electorate 
in that area," Beermann said. "And the coastal commission is not responsible to 
the electorate." 
</P>
<P>
Planners have pointed to a noticeable strain on resources in the commission's 
office in Long Beach, the governor's hometown. It is the busiest of the coastal 
commission offices and oversees coastal development in Los Angeles and Orange 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
"Our (building) permit load has increased from about 800 five years ago to more 
than 1,200 a year now, at the same time the number of staff planners has been 
reduced from 13 to 9," said Gary Timm, a planner in the Long Beach office. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach office has vacancies for two planners, but officials say the 
jobs are difficult to fill because qualified candidates, mindful of the 
commission's endangered status, are hesitant to apply for a job that may not 
last. 
</P>
<P>
Such staff shortages have left the commission vulnerable to criticism, both 
from developers, who complain about delays in their projects being approved, 
and environmentalists and slow-growth advocates, who say some projects drag so 
long that it is difficult to sustain opposition. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to personnel shortages, commission staffers complain of a lack of 
modern office equipment. For example, at the panel's San Francisco 
headquarters, workers still use a rotary phone system that frequently breaks 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"It got to the point where I finally just bought my own touch telephone at the 
office," said Jack Liebster, the agency's public information officer. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, the telephone problem will be relieved because the commission is 
expected to relocate its main office this spring. But the commission will have 
to absorb at least $200,000 annually for increased rent, "effectively resulting 
in another reduction in funds," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, none of the commission's permit application files are accessible by 
computer, meaning that staffers and the public must search through index cards 
for information on any of the thousands of commission actions over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Although a 1983 amendment to the state Coastal Act called for the creation of a 
Coastal Resource Information Center, which would be a computerized system 
tracking coastal development, staffers say the Legislature never allocated 
funds for it. "Even if we could afford to develop the software, there's no 
money to buy hardware," said Jim Burns, the agency's chief deputy director. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's report on the conditions facing the commission met with a mixed reaction 
from lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Several Democrats welcomed her assessment but said that until a new governor is 
elected in November there is not much that can be done to boost the 
commission's budget. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) predicted that whoever becomes 
governor will do a better job than Deukmejian of protecting the coastline. "I 
don't think anyone can do worse for the coast," Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
But Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro) maintained that the commission 
has exceeded the scope of its original authority -- preserving access to the 
coast. He said many of the commission's activities, such as monitoring oil 
spills, were never envisioned for the panel. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had stuck to what they were originally formed to do, their budget and 
staff is adequate," Felando maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Steve MacElvaine of Morro Bay, a Deukmejian appointee to the panel, said the 
commission was set up to certify local coastal programs and then turn over 
permitting of projects and enforcement to local authorities. MacElvaine, saying 
he was speaking just for himself and not the commission, said the reason for 
the work backlog is that local city coastal programs have not been completed. 
</P>
<P>
MacElvaine contended that much of the staff's time is occupied with dealing 
with permits for grading in the Santa Monica Mountains and the construction of 
tennis courts or decks. But, he said, if local governments had completed their 
own coastal plans, these decisions would usually be heard by local authorities 
and not the commission.

PART OF WASHINGTON BLVD. TO BE RENAMED; 
</P>
<P>
VENICE: A COMMITTEE APPROVES CHANGING THE NAME OF A CONFUSING STRETCH OF 
ROADWAY. THE NEW NAME HONORS VENICE FOUNDER ABBOT KINNEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Venice founder Abbot Kinney nudged U.S. founding father George Washington off a 
local street sign when a Los Angeles City Council committee voted last week to 
rename a stretch of Washington Boulevard for the man who built the Venice 
canals. 
</P>
<P>
But first the chairman of the Public Works Committee had to have a mini-lesson 
in history. "Who's Abbot Kinney?" asked Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky at the 
outset of a public hearing Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Kinney was the man who envisioned replicating Venice, Italy, in Los Angeles, 
complete with waterways, gondolas and a larger-than-life entertainment center, 
a sort of turn-of-the century Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members were asked by opponents of the name change not to forsake the 
country's first President on the eve of his birthday. But practicality at the 
edge of the Pacific held sway over nostalgia for the guy who lived on the banks 
of the Potomac. 
</P>
<P>
Personal experience weighed in too. Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores and 
Yaroslavsky both said they had been baffled by the numerous roadways in and 
near Venice named for the first President. In addition to Washington Boulevard, 
there's Washington Way, Washington Street and Washington Place. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said he has lived on the Westside since he was 7 and is "still not 
comfortable finding my way around Washington Street and Washington Boulevard. I 
go down there a lot to train for my marathons, and I still get confused," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents of the name change, most of whom live or own businesses on the 
street, did not concede without a battle. The opponents outnumbered the Kinney 
supporters at the meeting, but the council members appeared to be persuaded by 
accounts of lost emergency vehicles and complaints about confusion stemming 
from all the similar street names. 
</P>
<P>
The segment to be renamed is a 1 1/2-mile stretch between Lincoln Boulevard and 
Main Street. The Lincoln Boulevard intersection is where westbound Washington 
Boulevard inexplicably makes a sharp turn to the right; what seems like it 
should still be Washington Boulevard suddenly becomes Washington Street, ending 
at Venice Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the confusion, the segment to be renamed is known as West Washington 
Boulevard to local businesses and residents, who use that name on their 
stationery even though the city street signs read either "Washington South" or 
just plain "Washington." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose district includes Venice, became a key 
supporter of the name change. Her aides insist her support is predicated on 
helping emergency services keep the names straight, not granting a more upscale 
image to the gentrifying street. 
</P>
<P>
The full council must affirm the Public Works Committee's decision before the 
change takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
A neighborhood survey found that 52% of the property owners, residents and 
business people who live or work along the 1 1/2-mile strip were against the 
name change. But there was a sharp contrast of opinion among owners as compared 
to commercial and residential tenants; 72% of the property owners, most of whom 
do not live there, were in favor of the change to Abbot Kinney Boulevard, but 
88% of the tenants were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
The move to change the street name was spearheaded by J. Kevin Brunk, who owns 
two commercial properties on the street that he had already named for Kinney in 
expectation that the street name would follow. The West Washington Boulevard 
Merchants Assn., for which Brunk serves as president, changed its name to Abbot 
Kinney Boulevard Merchants Assn. Plans had been made to rename the street 
during the Venice Summer Arts and Crafts Festival last summer with the 
blessings of leading Venice community organizations, a rare showing of 
unanimity. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign was stalled, however, by a retired aerospace science consultant in 
his first foray into grass-roots politics. Walter Woods, a longtime resident of 
Washington Boulevard, held the name change up for six months by calling into 
question the validity of the signatures gathered by the pro-Kinney forces. 
Galanter withdrew her initial endorsement of the change while city engineers 
restudied the matter. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued this month by City Engineer Robert Horii, the 
department found "no clear overall mandate on either side" and did not make a 
recommendation to the council committee. 
</P>
<P>
Woods testified at the public hearing, telling the committee, "The people of 
the boulevard are the ones who count and the ones who don't want the change." 
</P>
<P>
But a parade of Venice community activists testified in favor of the change. 
"It's a matter of pride," said Susan Bell, president of the Venice Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the street segment to be named for Abbot Kinney has contained 
an eclectic mix of artists' studios, funky boutiques, antique stores, 
restaurants and residences. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, however, the street had perhaps been best known around the 
city as the scene of two tragedies. Journalist Sarai Ribicoff, the niece of 
former Sen. Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut, was murdered as she was leaving a 
restaurant there. A few years later, actress Eileen Brennan was seriously 
injured in a hit-and-run accident while crossing the street. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the street name change included business owners who complained of 
the cost of reprinting stationery, business cards and other forms. Architect 
Lise Matthews reeled off 15 separate forms she will have to change. 
</P>
<P>
Others said it would not allay confusion, only require further explanation and 
"make things even crazier." As one merchant put it, she would now have to say. 
"I'm on the street that used to be West Washington but is now Abbot Kinney 
Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
Some merchants, however, favored the change, citing the thousands of calls they 
field from lost customers. 
</P>
<P>
Though they expressed sympathy for the expense to the small-business owners, 
Flores and Yaroslavsky said they voted for what they believed was the greater 
public good. At Yaroslavsky's suggestion, the committee voted to give the 
boulevard designation to the stretch of Washington Street that most people 
think of as Washington Boulevard already. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't done away with West Washington Boulevard," said Jim Bickhart, 
planning director for Gelanter, after the hearing. "We've just moved it back to 
where it belongs." To ease the transition, Galanter aide Joan Cory said the 
city's Department of Transportation has agreed to post signs for both 
Washington Boulevard and Abbot Kinney Boulevard until confusion subsides. 
</P>
<P>
And arrangements are in the works with the post office to honor both names 
until 1992. That's when Venice is scheduled to receive a new area code -- so 
businesses and residents on the street will have to get new stationery anyway.

<P>
PIONEER'S 100 YEARS OF LIVING WAS FULL OF FIRSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN E. KLEIN, Klein is a Monrovia free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blanche Hubbard Jacques sat at a lace-covered kitchen table spread with a 
century's worth of black-and-white tintypes, faded portraits and yellowed 
diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
The Monrovia woman, whose 100th birthday is Tuesday, plucked out a sepia-tone 
of herself as a young girl -- one of six teen-agers who graduated from 
Nebraska's Alexandria High School in 1906 -- and another of herself posing with 
the school's first girls basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 5 feet, 10 inches, so I always played center," she said, recalling that 
the girls made their own uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Although she never ventured from her home state of Nebraska until she was 
married at 18, and has never set foot outside the United States, Jacques has 
lived through times that most people have only read about. 
</P>
<P>
She was the first woman in her town to own and operate a general store. Widowed 
during the Depression, she survived by raising food for herself and her six 
children. 
</P>
<P>
As a young woman in the 1920s, she shocked the townsfolk by shearing off her 
long hair to sport a stylish marcel wave. 
</P>
<P>
And when most people retire to an easy chair, she carved out a new career, 
caring for elderly people until she was near 80. 
</P>
<P>
"She reminds me of an early American pioneer, very slim and straight and basic 
but very caring," said Sue Church, the Los Feliz woman who was Jacques' last 
employer 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Church and other friends will be among a large group gathered from across the 
country in Monrovia today to honor Jacques at a gala one-century party. 
</P>
<P>
She has two surviving children, a dozen grandchildren, 18 great-grandchildren 
and five great-great-grandchildren, one of whom is expected to make it to the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Jacques, who lives with her youngest daughter, Winnie Olson, grew up on a 
Nebraska farm, where she was born in 1890 to parents of English and 
Scotch-Irish ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from high school, she worked in her father's hardware store 
until local banker Fred Jacques began frequenting the place, sometimes just to 
chat with her father and sometimes to stare at her. She married Jacques on Oct. 
10, 1908. 
</P>
<P>
"We just went and got married over to the county courthouse," Jacques recalled. 
"I never had met his people, so we went from the courthouse down to Hiawatha, 
Kan., so I could meet his family." 
</P>
<P>
The honeymoon trip was the first time she had left Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband built a large, two-story house two blocks from the bank, and there 
Jacques raised six children, first three boys and then three girls. 
</P>
<P>
She was up before sunrise to milk cows and feed children, gather eggs, weed her 
garden, and can fruit, vegetables, jams and pickles. 
</P>
<P>
Olson remembers the basement shelves lined floor to ceiling with Mason jars 
brimming with her mother's handiwork. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids all worked in the garden," Jacques recalled. "They liked to do it and 
they liked to eat what came out of it. We had an asparagus bed and there were 
cherry trees, an apple orchard and mulberries." 
</P>
<P>
When her youngest daughter was a year old, Jacques became one of the few 
working mothers in town, hiring a neighbor to baby-sit while she drove a Model 
A Ford 10 miles over unpaved roads to her mercantile store in the next town. 
</P>
<P>
"I sold cloth and spools of thread, and I would go to the local farmers and get 
their eggs and chickens to sell too," Jacques said. After the happy, prosperous 
years of the early 1920s, the family's fortunes changed, Jacques recalled. Her 
husband's bank closed after the stock market crash, and he died a few years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Jacques kept the family going by contracting with the railroad to feed workmen 
and by running a boarding house. 
</P>
<P>
When Jacques' children were grown, she moved to California to be near them, and 
in 1950 she began a 20-year career working as a nurse and companion to elderly 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Jacques cared for Mary Stermer's mother for four years, living with the family 
in Tustin. Stermer is one of several former employers who has kept in touch 
with Jacques for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
"She was an absolute mainstay," Stermer recalled. "She was extremely capable 
and mentally alert, and her physical strength was enormous. She was so 
thoughtful and good to all of us that we thought of her as a member of the 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Sue Church also hired Jacques, who was 78 at the time, to care for her 
70-year-old mother. "I remember on her days off Blanche would do all the 
cleaning and ironing for her daughters and grandchildren," Church said. "She 
had this great caring for people."

AMERICA'S HOUSING: BILL TO RAISE FHA LIMIT COULD AID STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1961, Jack Kemp, then quarterback of the San Diego Chargers and now 
secretary of Housing and Urban Development, bought his first home with a 
mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, Kemp would be unable to buy that same starter home with an 
FHA-backed mortgage. The FHA's mortgage maximum loan amount has not kept pace 
with the median price of housing, which has soared in expensive markets such as 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Although the FHA ceiling was raised recently to $124,875, which will allow FHA 
to write substantially more mortgages in high-cost areas, it will still be far 
below the median cost in cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, and in 
San Diego, where the median price of a house is $175,600. 
</P>
<P>
Affordable housing has become the newest chicken-in-every-pot issue, and there 
is considerable support for raising the ceiling again and allowing it to float 
with the median value in each city. 
</P>
<P>
What seems most popular and most likely to make it into the National Affordable 
Housing Act is a bill sponsored by Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and Alphonse 
D'Amato (R-N.Y.), which would set a new ceiling at 95% of the median value of 
housing within a particular metropolitan area. The ceiling could not exceed 90% 
of the state median. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are so high in some markets, Cranston argued before the Senate voted to 
increase the limit last September, that the FHA was "simply knocked out of the 
market." 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, there is no historical precedent for keeping the FHA limit below 
the median value of housing in any particular area. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, in the mid-1960s the loan limit was 70% above the median sales price 
of existing homes, providing FHA coverage for all but the most expensive homes. 
It wasn't until the mid-1980s that the ceiling dropped below the median. Even 
at 95%, the program will still be restricted to housing in the lower half. 
</P>
<P>
All the players are taking sides on the issues of whether to raise the ceiling 
once more. 
</P>
<P>
The realtors, home builders and mortgage bankers, backed by Cranston and other 
congressmen, lined up against the private mortgage insurance industry and the 
savings and loans, which are backed by Sens. Don Nickles (R-Okla.) and Jesse 
Helms (R-N.C.), who fought even the new $124,875-ceiling, calling it a "fat-cat 
provision." 
</P>
<P>
Some consumer advocacy groups also have voiced concerns that raising the limit 
could contribute to the national housing affordability problem. 
</P>
<P>
The FHA was created by Congress in 1934 to make housing opportunities available 
at a time when the whole housing finance system was in disarray. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to FHA, home buyers had to make substantial down payments and finance 
their purchases with short-term balloon loans. The FHA was the creator of the 
long-term, amortized mortgage that we still use in one form or another today. 
</P>
<P>
John M. Ols Jr., director of housing and community development issues for the 
Government Accounting Office, told the House subcommittee on housing and 
community development that the purpose of FHA "is to encourage improvement in 
housing standards and conditions, provide an adequate home financing system 
through mortgage insurance and exert a stabilizing influence on the mortgage 
market." 
</P>
<P>
To make it all work, the FHA, decades ago, set up its own self-sustaining 
mortgage insurance fund to insure loans for single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
A recent GAO audit painted a dire picture of the FHA's present and future. In 
fiscal year 1988, the single-family insurance fund, which constitutes the bulk 
of FHA activity, lost $1.4 billion, leaving just $1.8 billion in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
The FHA, which has insured mortgages for 17 million people since its inception, 
is in for some changes. Those changes could be in down payment requirements or 
in loan-to-value ratios. A permanent change in the allowable loan ceiling is 
almost a certainty. 
</P>
<P>
A big fight is brewing over which direction FHA should take. 
</P>
<P>
Mark E. Goldhaber, vice president of General Electric Mortgage Insurance Cos., 
a private mortgage insurer, said, "From our industry's point of view, the 95% 
plan will take a large segment of the market that is already being served by 
the private sector and federalize it. Who are we trying to serve with the FHA? 
Raising the limit, whether in Los Angeles or Boston, doesn't help the family of 
four making $50,000 a year afford a house. That family still cannot afford a 
median-priced house of $200,000." 
</P>
<P>
The Mortgage Insurance Cos. of America (MICA) has released a study saying that 
mortgages of more than $80,000 actually are riskier than lower mortgages, and 
the FHA would be exposing itself to even greater risk of loss by increasing its 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's the case, why don't they differentiate in their fees?" asked Ols in 
an interview, noting that PMI companies do not charge higher insurance premiums 
for the higher, and supposedly riskier, loans. MICA's numbers conflict directly 
with the findings of the GAO, which showed that higher mortgages have "slightly 
lower default rates and . . . lower percentage losses when they default." 
</P>
<P>
The PMI companies, said Kent Colton, executive vice president of the National 
Assn. of Home Builders, "don't want the competition from FHA. The person who 
will lose if they succeed is the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a clear mistake to eliminate the FHA as a player in markets like 
California. It is clearly discriminatory." 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Realtors supports the 95% proposal. 
</P>
<P>
NAR senior vice president Stephen Dreisler said, "Everything in life tends to 
be relative. And a median-priced house in Los Angeles ought to be eligible for 
FHA financing just like a median-priced house in Louisville, Ky. A fireman in 
Los Angeles ought to be able to buy a house using FHA just as his counterpart 
in Louisville does." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's chief housing aide, Donald Campbell, explained the proposal for the 
95% limit: "What we are trying to do is to provide some more equity across the 
country, so that modest homes in all areas are covered by FHA." 
</P>
<P>
Allowing the FHA to insure loans up to 95% of the median value in any 
metropolitan area, up to 90% of that particular state's median value, will 
strengthen the FHA fund, Campbell argued, saying it makes sense in the 
insurance industry that spreading business across a number of markets reduces 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the FHA's experience with its own higher-end mortgages, the GAO study 
says that a higher ceiling would expand FHA's market and probably increase the 
equity in the single-family fund substantially. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to recognize that raising the ceiling strengthens the fund by lowering 
the risk of the total portfolio," Campbell said. "There are two ways to do 
this: one is to expand the market to lower risk borrowers; the other is to stop 
serving the high-risk borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
"The only other option," Campbell joked, "is to start pumping in taxpayer 
money." 
</P>
<P>
In 55 years, FHA has never gone hat in hand to the taxpayer; any losses on 
foreclosed property has been offset by premium income. 
</P>
<P>

EDUCATING NEW CLASS OF DEVELOPERS AT USC; 
</P>
<P>
GRADUATE SCHOOL: MASTER'S PROGRAM FEATURES 'HANDS-ON' TRAINING AND THE ADVICE 
OF EXPERTS. MOST ENROLLEES HAVE EXPERIENCE IN RELATED FIELDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM MAHONEY, Mahoney is a free-lance writer and Los Angeles bureau chief 
of Electronic Media. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a recent afternoon, a handful of USC students were sitting around a 
conference table mapping out plans to build a medical office building. 
</P>
<P>
That's a pretty heady task for students, but the extracurricular planning 
session known as "The Real Deal" is an integral part of the learning experience 
they're getting in USC's Master of Real Estate Development course. 
</P>
<P>
The program is the only one of its kind in the West and one of five in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"Our sense is that this is a field that needs serious academic attention," said 
Alan Kreditor, who began the program in 1986 and oversees it as executive 
director of the Lusk Center for Real Estate Development at USC, where the 
program is housed. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to create a profession out of what's been an industry," said Kreditor, 
dean of USC's School of Urban and Regional Planning. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, developers have entered the field somewhat incidentally from a 
related field, such as construction, real estate finance or brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
But, Kreditor said, "It's a much more sophisticated, far more important and 
socially relevant field than I think a lot of people have fully recognized." 
</P>
<P>
The program, which is in its fourth year, with 46 students, up from 19 in the 
first class, offers highly specialized courses on topics such as site planning, 
market feasibility and design, besides staples such as finance and law. 
</P>
<P>
Other comparable master's of real estate development courses also exist at MIT, 
which began the first program in 1984; Texas A&amp;M, Columbia University and 
New York University. 
</P>
<P>
Academicians see the programs as part of an overall trend toward the growing 
importance of higher education in the area of development. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the undergraduate lays certain groundwork," observed Marvin Nadler, 
who teaches a 12-week course on shopping center development at UCLA Extension. 
</P>
<P>
"The master's program, in my opinion, then gives you an in-depth look as if you 
were getting the on-the-job training," said the real estate educator, who is 
president of Financial Advisors Realty Co., shopping center development 
consultants in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
"In today's world, unless you have an excellent educational background, you're 
not going to go very far in development," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The development degree at USC is a 10-month course of 32 credits of core 
classes and eight credits of electives. It begins in July and runs through May. 
</P>
<P>
At $450 a credit, the private university's course costs a hefty $18,000, which 
has forced some students to take equity lines on their mortgages, rely on 
spousal support or even tend bar at night to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
And, because the program is mainly geared toward applicants with at least a few 
years of professional experience, many people who join up may even be trading 
in vice president stripes and fat salaries as well. 
</P>
<P>
But attracting students who have work experience, besides strong undergraduate 
records and good test scores on a graduate-placement exam, is of paramount 
importance, according to the program's organizers. 
</P>
<P>
"By having gone for people who have already had some experience, we're getting 
them when their learning curve is very sharp," Kreditor said . 
</P>
<P>
That requirement also enables students to relate better to the development 
professionals who lend their time to the program. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten very, very close to what we regard as the best of the development 
industry for their counsel and support and advice and their willingness to 
bring their experiences to the students," Kreditor said. "They do more than 
just write us a check; they're there." 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the developers have taken students out to sites and walked around the 
projects," noted Susan Kamei, director of administrative affairs for the Lusk 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Their participation with one another and with the faculty and staff here is 
very symbiotic," she said of the professionals. "They learn by it. We learn by 
it." 
</P>
<P>
John Lusk, chairman of the Lusk Co., a development firm in Irvine, said that 
that aspect of USC's approach was part of what motivated him and his son, 
William, Lusk's vice chairman, to donate $4 million to establish the Lusk 
Center last year. 
</P>
<P>
"What attracted me was the practical manner in which they were running the 
division," he said. "They were having well-known developers come in and talk to 
the students." 
</P>
<P>
One aspect of that involvement is the developer-in-residence program, in which 
three developers regularly come to the school to speak to students, conduct 
round-table discussions and consult with them one-on-one. 
</P>
<P>
"Developers as such can provide some interesting war stories and probably some 
interesting success stories," said Harry Newman Jr., chairman of Newman 
Properties, a Long Beach company specializing in shopping center development 
and asset management, who is currently a developer-in-residence. 
</P>
<P>
What's also important, according to Newman, is being able to keep students 
up-to-date with the development industry, which has evolved rapidly in the past 
two decades. 
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that they become sensitive to environmental issues and that 
they become more familiar with planned growth and how that affects 
</P>
<P>
whatever specialty they've chosen to practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The field has gotten very, very complicated," echoed Nadler, the development 
consultant and teacher, "and you need to be professional, and you need to know 
what to look for and what experts to bring in." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 46 students currently enrolled in USC's program, 33 are devoted to the 
development course exclusively -- 23 on a full-time basis and 10 part-time -- 
while of the 13 others, six are completing the development program and earning 
a doctor of law degree simultaneously, and seven are earning the master of real 
estate and a master of business administration. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, there were 21 full-time students in the program, five part-time 
students and five simultaneously pursuing MBAs. 
</P>
<P>
Kreditor said the program is exceeding its projections for growth in 
enrollment, but he pointed out that the school has set a limit on the number of 
students it will take of the more than 100 applications received each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to have 35 full-time students," he said. "We have no ambitions of 
seeing it any bigger than that." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that "each year we're finding that our application pool gets 
broader geographically. 
</P>
<P>
"The first year, we were all Southern Californians, the second year, we had 
some Northern Californians, the third year, we started to go national and this 
year, we started to go international," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The current class includes students from 10 states, as well as Japan, Taiwan 
and Hong Kong, and seven women, the most ever. 
</P>
<P>
The Lusk Center promotes its students by compiling a "profiles book" of current 
class members and then sending another book of their resumes to 2,000 
developers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a big surprise when they see the profiles book," said Richard Peiser, 
director of the Lusk Center. "They just don't realize until they see it that 
this is an older group that is very diverse." 
</P>
<P>
The current crop of students includes people specializing in everything from 
securities to international relations to psychology to the more-expected real 
estate backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Both the students and the professional developers see that melting-pot effect 
as beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
"My view is that the diversity is the strength because it encourages the 
expression of a variety of viewpoints and values, which I think can be a real 
stimulus for growth among all those people participating," said Newman, the 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that it's actually one of the best aspects of the program," said Bo 
Kaemerle, 25, who's going through the real estate program part time while also 
pursuing his law degree. 
</P>
<P>
His undergraduate background is one of the more unusual ones in the class: He 
holds a bachelor of science degree in biology from the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow student Tom Tillisch, 28, is a licensed real estate broker who earned a 
bachelor of science degree in business administration from USC in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people that go into development are coming from one discipline," 
he noted. "As a broker, I worked with many developers, and you could see where 
they would be strong because that's the area they came from, say marketing or 
architecture." 
</P>
<P>
But Tillisch believes he'll emerge from USC's program as a more well-rounded 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
"In my first project, it'll give me the ability to look at everything with some 
confidence, look at all of the different disciplines and kind of work with the 
architect and the lawyer, etcetera, instead of just having them dictate 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the program) gives them an edge," Newman said. "You know that they 
have been exposed to a lot of situational thinking and they have a broader 
picture of the development field than somebody who has been in a single job for 
a period of time." 
</P>
<P>
"Several people (who are graduates of the program) have consummated their first 
deals on their own and that's one of my long-run barometers of success," said 
Peiser, the faculty member. 
</P>
<P>
Kreditor added that USC carefully tracks the placement record of its students 
and said so far "everybody that wanted to go out and get a job in development 
got one." 
</P>
<P>
Julia Lord, 28, the first woman to graduate from the program, lives in San 
Francisco now, where she is developing projects with Thad Doyka, 36, who 
finished the program with her in May, 1987, in USC's first real estate 
development class. 
</P>
<P>
"I use something probably every day that I picked up there (at USC)," Lord 
said. "I probably would not be developing out on my own today if I had not gone 
through the program." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Rettig, 30, another one of the 19 students in that first class, is now in 
charge of special projects in the office of the president at IDM Corp., a 
development company in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
He said the program was "wholly and completely worth every nickel, dime, 
penny." 
</P>
<P>
Rettig recently invited the current class of Lusk Center students to tour the 
Greater Los Angeles World Trade Center in Long Beach, IDM's major project. "We 
got another perspective," recalled Kaemerle, who adds that the experience "was 
pretty inspiring." 
</P>
<P>
But the USC program also gives students a taste of what it's like to fail. 
</P>
<P>
In one Real Deal project, students put together $10,000 to develop a building 
in Desert Hot Springs, but the tenant pulled out at the last minute and the 
entire deal fell through. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was in many ways much better than if they had suddenly built it 
and sold it off and tripled their money," Kreditor said. 
</P>
<P>
"As one of our board members said, the worst thing that could happen to a 
developer is that he makes money on his first deal, because he then walks 
around believing it's easy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little like going into Vegas and putting money on a number and it comes 
up, and you say, 'this gambling's a cinch.' " 
</P>

<P>
Seeing a replica of the sleek, sculpted facade of the Pan Pacific Auditorium 
here in Disney World was a shock, especially after having passed by the charred 
ruins of the original a few days before in Los Angeles' Fairfax District. 
</P>
<P>
I had heard that the Streamline Moderne-styled Pan had been meticulously 
reconstructed as the main entrance to the new Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park 
outside Orlando, and made a point to go see it while on a pilgrimage here 
recently with two of my four Mousketeers. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, there was the reconstituted Pan, graced by the four curved 
flagpole pylons in the shape of giant fins that had distinguished the original 
when it was built in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Although slightly reduced in scale and modified with ticket booths and 
turnstiles, the replicated Pan exudes a sense of time and place -- a quality 
that had earned the original building its landmark status at local, state and 
national levels. 
</P>
<P>
Even the signage, with its compressed block "Queen Mary modern" typography, is 
right out of the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted something as the gateway to the park that was easily recognizable 
and that captured the spirit of Los Angeles and Hollywood in the Golden 1930s 
and '40s," explained architect Robert Weis, a senior vice president of World 
Disney Imagineering, which designed the new theme park. "The Pan with its 
pylons seemed absolutely correct." 
</P>
<P>
The replication in Disney World, completed nearly to the day the original was 
destroyed in an arsonist's fire eight months ago, is heavy with an irony that 
makes me heartsick. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 years before the fatal fire, preservationists in Los Angeles had pressed 
for the Pan's renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Various plans were put forward, with one finally emerging out of a county 
competition in 1988 calling for recycling and expanding the landmark with 
private funds as an entertainment and community services complex. 
</P>
<P>
However, bureaucratic inertia, parochial neighborhood protests and lack of 
political courage stalled the plan. Meanwhile, the Pan stood vacant and 
deteriorating, a target for vandalism and, inevitably, the fire. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that one of the city's more magnificent architectural and 
cultural symbols, and one of a few to be listed on the National Register of 
Historic Places, is a charred ruin. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there are various plans for its restoration, but most involve 
public funds and are as wispy as smoke. There is no evidence of a civic will to 
make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to its credit, Disney Imagineering has had the vision to use the 
design of the Pan to set the architectural scene of its latest theme park based 
upon Hollywood of "the fabulous '30s and '40s." 
</P>
<P>
Also in the park, just beyond the Pan, is a replica of the Crossroads of the 
World tower (the original perseveres at 6671 Sunset Blvd.). It appropriately 
serves as an information booth at the head of engaging "Hollywood Boulevard," 
lined with the facades of an evocative collection of other Los Angeles period 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
These include the Dark Room (the original is at 5370 Wilshire Blvd.), with its 
display window in the form of an oversized 1930s camera, and a brilliant 
selection of Hollywood Boulevard Art Deco-styled store fronts, marked by a mix 
of Vitrolite glass panels and zigzagged gold terra-cotta panels embossed with 
designs reminiscent of Southwest Indian rugs. Among the facades hinted at are 
J. J. Newberry's and Frederick's (in the 6600 block of Hollywood Boulevard). 
</P>
<P>
There is also a replica of the Chinese Theatre (6925 Hollywood Blvd.); a host 
of thematic restaurants, such as the Brown Derby, and 1950s-styled cafeterias; 
an ice cream stand in the form of a dinosaur, and an "Echo Park" lake. All 
radiate a spirit of L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have tried to create is an 'idealized' L.A. in Florida," Weis said. 
"Just as Main Street in the Magic Kingdom was created in the 1950s as a 
nostalgic vision of turn-of-the-century small-town America, our Hollywood 
Boulevard is a nostalgic vision of Los Angeles of 50 years ago. Helping is the 
city's rich architectural vocabulary of the time." 
</P>
<P>
So, while Los Angeles is letting its landmarks deteriorate or be bulldozed, 
Disney, after a fashion, is saving them, albeit in a very controlled 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps someday to get a sense of the rich cultural and architectural heritage 
of Hollywood in the '30s, we may just have to travel to Florida and pay an 
entrance fee. 
</P>
<P>
You would think that by now the value of historic preservation in economic and 
social terms (read tourism and pride) would be appreciated in Tinseltown, the 
dream factory of the world. It is certainly being appreciated here in the 
Florida outback. 
</P>
<P>
There were other urban design lessons to be learned in Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
Weis said that critical to the design and construction process in all Disney 
projects was not only respect for the spirit of the varying styles copied, but 
a particular sensitivity for the pedestrian experience. 
</P>
<P>
The architect, a graduate of Cal Poly Pomona, added that all the heights of 
buildings, the widths of streets and the sizes of plazas were reduced to what 
he described as "Disneyland scale" so none would overwhelm people. 
</P>
<P>
Also noted was the prepossessing Disney penchant for cleanliness and 
friendliness. 
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to create environments that make people feel safe and comfortable," 
Weis said. 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad aim for any planning and design effort. Certainly, Los Angeles could 
use such "imagineering."

</P>
<P>
ALHAMBRA: TOWN'S MIX OF ANGLOS AND LATINOS HAS SEEN CHANGES WITH INFLUX OF 
ASIANS, MANY OF WHOM HAVE INVESTED IN BUSINESSES AND HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A decade ago, the moon cake was as unfamiliar to residents of Alhambra as the 
hamburger was to the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
But today the bean-filled Chinese delicacy is common fare in most bakeries of 
the San Gabriel Valley community, where Asians account for more than 30% of its 
population. 
</P>
<P>
"Alhambra has been experiencing the winds of change with hurricane force," 
noted Warner Jenkins, the editor of the Alhambra Post Advocate for the last 42 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"The infusion of Asian money, Asian customs and the energy of immigrants 
experiencing a new kind of freedom and opportunity have made a big difference," 
Jenkins said, adding that of Alhambra's 75,000 residents, Anglos and Latinos 
now make up less than two-thirds of the population mix. 
</P>
<P>
David and Fei Louie, newlyweds in their 20s, recently closed escrow on a 
$190,000-townhouse in Alhambra. David, a native of Hong Kong, has been in the 
U.S. for more than a decade, while Fei arrived from mainland China three years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in a good area and in a well-educated community," said Louie, an 
assistant vice president at Banker's Trust in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Ho, the agent at Imperial Realty who sold the Louies their home, finds it 
easy to sell properties in Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done very well selling to new immigrants, many of whom are young 
professionals," said Ho, adding that one of the reasons they can afford to buy 
property is because their parents often provide the down payment needed for the 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, we Chinese want to help our children get a good start in life," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the influx of Asian immigrants created unsettling feelings for many 
of Alhambra's long-time residents. 
</P>
<P>
Even Dr. Annie Chin Siu, a Chinese-American who settled in Alhambra 35 years 
ago with her physician husband when very few Asians lived there, admits she had 
to adjust to the changes. 
</P>
<P>
"For a native Californian like myself, the new Asians seemed so different," 
said the Alhambra orthodontist and former president of the local Chamber of 
Commerce. "But because I had an Asian face, they related to me, and it was 
easier to establish communication. 
</P>
<P>
"The immigrants, especially older Asians, are taught to blend into the woodwork 
and not make any waves," she said. "It's refreshing to see that the younger 
people who have been arriving from Taiwan and Hong Kong have brought with them 
a strong sense of enterprise and enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
High on the list of amenities that draw newcomers to the city is Alhambra's 
convenient location, only 8 miles northeast of Los Angeles Civic Center. This 
was a major consideration for newlyweds Maruca and Jose H. (Pepe) Ojeda, who 
both commute to jobs in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm employed by Childrens Hospital and my husband has a job with the Bank of 
America. It only takes us 25 minutes to get to work," Maruca Ojeda said. "We 
drive the surface streets to avoid the freeway traffic." 
</P>
<P>
The Ojedas were married last October and started looking for a house in 
Montebello, El Monte, Covina and other affordable communities before purchasing 
their 1,240-square-Spanish-style home in Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to live in Alhambra because it was the kind of stable community 
where eventually we would want to raise our family. Alhambra is close-knit, has 
nice parks and is well maintained and secure," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's 160-member police force prides itself on a lower crime rate than 
most similarly sized communities and on its three-minute response to major 
crime calls. 
</P>
<P>
Broker Millie Williams of Century 21 ACRES, a neighbor of the young couple, 
sold them their home. "It was a particularly good buy for the Ojedas at 
$194,000," she said. "Anything that close to San Marino normally sells for 
around $240,000." 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to do some fixing to the property," said Cuban-born Ojeda, "but 
that's always expected when you move into an older home. Maruca and I will 
enjoy making something beautiful out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some older residents have been cashing in on huge home equities and 
moving away from the community, said editor Jenkins, who paid $18,000 for his 
home in 1958 and recently declined a cash offer of $300,000 for the house. 
</P>
<P>
"Others are simply being squeezed out by the high cost of living," he said. 
"Those most affected are older women who have outlived their families and live 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
One of these is Gwen Cottier, who at 82 feels fortunate to be paying only $445 
a month for her small two-bedroom court bungalow near the center of town. "I 
get by on Social Security, Medicare and on the small sums I receive for 
performing at local clubs and organizations." 
</P>
<P>
A former career pianist and singer, Cottier is active in the community's Crime 
Club and Postal Alert programs and does volunteer work at Joslyn Center, which 
sponsors programs for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Rising housing costs within the community are most apparent in an area commonly 
known as the Bean Tract in the northeast portion of the community adjoining San 
Marino, said realtor Tom Berge who manages the Berge Co. 
</P>
<P>
"A tear-down in that area would cost you around $250,000, while a four-bedroom 
home with all the modern amenities would run close to $650,000," Berge said. 
</P>
<P>
The least-expensive residential property can be found next to the San 
Bernardino (10) Freeway and alongside the railroad track on Mission Street, he 
noted. Home prices there average from around $180,000 or $190,000. 
</P>
<P>
A new housing trend is seen in increasing numbers of new multifamily 
developments being built throughout the community, Berge said. "The price for 
three-bedroom condo units is at about $200,000, while rentals average between 
$1,000 and $1,200 a month in upscale areas." 
</P>
<P>
Unusual properties like Dupuy Castle, just south of Valley Boulevard near the 
western entrance to the city, are rare listings nowadays, said Orin Berge, who 
founded the long-established realty firm. 
</P>
<P>
"The castle, with its numerous secret passages and turrets, has long been the 
source of mysterious speculation and is said to have served as a hide-out for 
Eastern gangsters. It was built in 1926 to resemble a chateau in the Pyrenees," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Berge Co. sold the 10,000-square-foot, 26-room chateau for $400,000 a few years 
ago after it was sectioned off into apartment units and had fallen into 
disrepair. The concrete-and-steel structure, extensively renovated by its most 
recent owner, is back on the market for $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Ramona Convent remains the most visible of Alhambra's landmarks, and is 
said to be the oldest private Catholic school in Los Angeles County still on 
its original site. It was founded in 1899 by the Sisters of the Holy Names. 
</P>
<P>
The city was incorporated in 1903, but its earlier formative years are linked 
to Benjamin D. Wilson, a native of Tennessee and wealthy land owner known as 
Don Benito, who purchased the original Alhambra Tract. 
</P>
<P>
The naming of Alhambra is credited to Wilson's daughters, who had read 
Washington Irving's tales of the Moorish palace in Spain and suggested it to 
their father. Hence, also the city's romantic street names -- Almansor, 
Granada, Valencia, Cordova, Vega and Hidalgo. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Outwater, Alhambra's city clerk from 1966 through 1986, lives in one of 
the community's older homes, which was built by her husband's parents in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
"I find the growth in the community in recent years very exciting," she said. 
"One of the more dramatic changes has been in the influx of Asians. I find them 
very gracious." 
</P>
<P>
The current demographics for the community are clearly reflected in the student 
enrollment at Alhambra's four high schools (which are 55% Asian) and an even 
greater Asian student enrollment in the elementary grades, said Parker 
Williams, vice president of the Asian-owned American International Bank and a 
former mayor of the city who now serves as president of its board of education. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, we have become the beneficiaries," Williams added. "Historically, 
education has been an important focus for Asians, and this kind of motivation 
for scholastic achievement has spread to all our students." 
</P>
<P>
For Charles A. Hayden, a mortician since 1949, Alhambra's growth and 
development would be far greater today if not stymied by the delays in linking 
the Long Beach Freeway to the Ventura (134) and Foothill (210) freeways. 
</P>
<P>
"It remains the biggest problem we face," he said. "And we just haven't 
addressed it firmly enough. Too many of Alhambra's main streets, like Garfield 
and Atlantic, are being used as access to northern communities from Interstate 
10." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Paules, 33, the city's assistant manager and director of housing and 
community development, agrees with Hayden on the need to resolve the freeway 
issue, although, he said, there have been major gains for Alhambra, 
particularly in the mid-'80s, that account for a healthy and growing economy. 
</P>
<P>
To the south, new Asian businesses have mushroomed along the town's 3-mile 
stretch of Valley Boulevard, where properties that sold for $20 per square foot 
10 years ago are now worth $150 a square foot. 
</P>
<P>
"And the rebirth and beautification of Main Street, which seemed doomed to 
becoming a ghost town in the '60s and '70s, is another of Alhambra's signs of 
wellness," Paules said. 
</P>
<P>
"On its south side, Alhambra Place -- a major shopping hub anchored by Mervyn's 
and a multi-screen theater complex -- already has helped restore the town's 
pedestrian environment. And in a few months, construction is expected to begin 
on a new 40,000-square-foot upscale supermarket and 60,000-square-foot retail 
center on the north side of Main Street." 
</P>
<P>
Notable development to the west, Paules said, includes Auto Row and a busy 
Commerce Center that includes the Price Club, with a reported retail volume of 
$100 million a year.

SALES HOT IN 'BIG CHILL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am an active, professional real estate broker and work hard to meet my 
clients' needs and provide accurate information on the marketplace. Your 
reporting in "The Big Chill" (Jan. 14) by David W. Myers has erroneously 
created a perception that we are not selling homes. 
</P>
<P>
According to you, if homes do sell, they sell for $100,000 less than asking 
price, and every seller has to give a trip to Tahiti to get the home sold. This 
is not correct. In our board in Glendale we had more sales in the last quarter 
of 1989 than we had in the same quarter in prior years. 
</P>
<P>
The main difference today is that we now have twice the number of homes for 
sale. This is truly an advantage for the buyer, who has twice the selection of 
properties. In addition, sellers may carry financing, pay closing costs or 
negotiate their prices now where they would not have previously. 
</P>
<P>
A buyer today is missing an excellent opportunity to purchase a home on his 
terms. This may not be the case in a few months during our peak selling period. 
There will be even more buyers, again increasing the demand and reducing the 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it is apparent that columnist Robert J. Bruss has not worked with 
a professional realtor recently, nor has he listed or sold a property with one 
in many years. His recommendations regarding disclosures have some of my 
clients so frightened they are reluctant to sell. 
</P>
<P>
His advice to list only for 30 days with a broker is also not the way to 
effectively market a property. None of the successful, knowledgeable agents I 
know would work under those conditions. Would Mr. Bruss? Isn't he allowed to 
handle a lawsuit through to successful close? 
</P>
<P>
A realtor is being hired for his/her expertise, including the time it will take 
to sell a property. In most cases this is controlled by the sellers' asking 
price.

A CALL TO ARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is in response to the mortgage question-and-answer item "Adjustables Have 
Lost Their Advantage" (Feb. 4, Special to the Times). All things being equal, I 
would agree it would be wise to take a fixed-rate loan over an adjustable-rate 
mortgage these days. 
</P>
<P>
However, there are some advantages to adjustable-rate mortgages that are of 
great significance to some borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Many people can't quality for the higher starting rate of a fixed-rate 
loan. Many lenders qualify people at starting rates as low as 7.5% on 
adjustable-rate mortgages. It may be better for some people to start out with 
an ARM. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In many instances borrowers are allowed higher loan-to-value ratios with an 
ARM than with a fixed-rate mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Also, there are many adjustable-rate mortgages that can be obtained for no 
points. Most fixed-rate pricing involves points. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Many adjustable loans have the possibility of negative amortization. The 
required monthly payment and increases are limited and would allow some 
borrowers to afford the payment when they could not on a fixed-rate loan.

California home builders took out 237,279 new housing permits last year, down 
7.2% from the 255,559 in 1988, according to Richard L. Hall, president of the 
California Building Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Single-family permits last year totaled 162,140, almost no change from the

<P>
GETTING RID OF PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE; 
</P>
<P>
HOME LOANS: WHEN A HOMEOWNER HAS A 20%, OR GREATER, EQUITY IN THE PROPERTY, THE 
LENDER MAY AGREE TO DROP THE PMI PAYMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Questions about mortgage insurance, VA loans and condominiums recently dropped 
out of the mailbag and onto the desk. 
</P>
<P>
Two readers asked different questions about private mortgage insurance, or PMI. 
That's the type of insurance that lenders usually require when the down payment 
on your home is less than 20% of the home's purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of PMI depends primarily on the size of your mortgage, but typically 
ranges from $25 to $50 a month. If you default on your loan, the insurer will 
reimburse the lender for at least part of its losses. 
</P>
<P>
PMI payments are usually made into an impound account and factored into your 
monthly mortgage payment. But what many homeowners don't realize is that these 
payments can often be eliminated after their equity stake in the property 
reaches 20% or more. 
</P>
<P>
Don Nichols of Gardena says his in-laws bought a house two years ago and that 
they now have more than a 20% equity stake in their property. His question: 
"Can they now drop the PMI without refinancing?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer is probably yes, although cancellation procedures vary from one 
lender to the next. 
</P>
<P>
A few lenders will cancel the PMI simply after you make a phone call or write a 
letter and the lender verifies that you have at least a 20% equity stake in the 
property. Others will cancel it if you furnish a letter from one or two 
realtors estimating the current value of your home. 
</P>
<P>
However, most will insist that you obtain an appraisal of your property's 
current value, and that you pay the appraiser's $150 to $300 fee yourself. The 
lender might also specify which appraiser to use. 
</P>
<P>
If the lender balks at your request to cancel PMI, ask your banker whether your 
home loan has been sold to the Federal National Mortgage Assn. or the Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. These two government-chartered agencies purchase about 
2 million loans a year from lending institutions, and both generally require 
lenders to cancel private mortgage insurance if certain conditions are met. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, not all borrowers can drop their mortgage insurance. That's bad 
news for Robert Jones of Ontario, who asks if he can stop paying the monthly 
mortgage insurance on his FHA loan. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance premium on loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration -- 
an amount equal to 3.8% of the total loan amount -- usually can't be dropped 
because most lenders who make the loans eventually sell them to the Government 
National Mortgage Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The GNMA, nicknamed "Ginnie Mae," pools the government-backed FHA loans it buys 
and then sells shares in the pools to investors. 
</P>
<P>
Since mortgages in the pools are backed by the federal government, so are the 
Ginnie Mae securities. That makes them virtually as safe as U.S. Treasury 
bonds, a factor that attracts safety-conscious investors. 
</P>
<P>
If homeowners were allowed to drop their FHA insurance premiums, Ginnie Maes 
would no longer have government backing and many investors wouldn't buy them. 
As a result, rates on the securities would have to be raised or less money 
would flow into the nation's banking system -- either of which would tend to 
push mortgage rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
Although you probably can't drop your monthly FHA insurance premium, take 
heart: It's essentially a "user fee" for a loan that enabled you to buy a home 
that you probably couldn't have afforded otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Several veterans of the armed services have asked whether they're eligible for 
a VA loan if they have used the program before. The answer is a qualified yes. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bruce Norman, executive vice president of First Mortgage Corp. in 
Diamond Bar, there are two basic requirements that the vet must meet to reuse 
the program: The previous VA loan must be paid in full, and the borrower can no 
longer own the property that the loan financed. 
</P>
<P>
These two requirements might make it seem as if a veteran who currently lives 
in a home financed with a VA loan would have to sell the property, pay off the 
loan and rent some place for weeks or even months while he waited for his new 
VA loan to come through. However, that's not the case. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Norman said, the lender who is financing the new home can issue loan 
approval for the new VA loan contingent on proof that the old loan has been 
paid in full. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the paper work is processed while the vet's first home is in escrow: 
After the deal closes, the new lender presents proof to the VA that the old 
loan was paid in full. The new lender then funds the new VA loan and gets a new 
VA guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
Since it takes a couple of days to provide all this documentation, the vet 
usually works out an agreement to rent his old home from the new owners for a 
few days. When the new lender has completed all the paper work, the vet can 
move into his new house. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Greenberg, who lives in Florida and recently read this column in the 
Miami Herald, says she and her husband are thinking of buying the condominium 
that they currently rent. But, she adds, "my son says we won't be able to write 
off all our mortgage interest payments. Is he right?" 
</P>
<P>
It sounds like your son may be confused. You can generally write off all your 
mortgage-interest payments on a condo loan, the same way you'd write them off 
if you purchased a single-family house. Payments for property taxes are also 
fully deductible. 
</P>
<P>
What your son may be talking about are the dues that your condo development's 
homeowners association will collect. The Internal Revenue Service usually won't 
let you deduct association dues unless your condo is considered rental 
property. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to play it safe, contact an accountant or other qualified 
professional for help.

THE SMALL INVESTOR: A NEGATIVE CASH FLOW CAN PAY OFF IF PROPERTY APPRECIATES IN 
VALUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: What do you think of investing in rental houses in a good area which 
has been appreciating nicely in value but which will produce a negative cash 
flow of about $300 per month? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: We just lost several readers who are not familiar with the term 
negative cash flow. It means the property produces less rental income than the 
cost of mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance and other operative 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if a rental house produces $1,000 per month rent but it costs 
$1,200 monthly to operate, then it has a $200 negative cash flow each month. 
</P>
<P>
I generally do not recommend buying properties that have a negative cash flow. 
However, I have and continue to buy real estate that has a negative cash flow 
if it is appreciating handsomely in market value and will probably continue to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
For example, I own a rental house that produces only $925 per month rent but it 
costs me $1,047 for the mortgage each month. But this house appreciated at 
least $10,000 in market value last year, so I consider that to be a pretty good 
investment despite the negative cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
To more directly answer your question, a modest negative cash flow is justified 
if the property is appreciating in market value and will probably continue to 
do so in the future. However, if the market values of homes in your town are 
not appreciating, don't buy negative cash flow property. 
</P>

Heir Looking for a Profitable Investment 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently inherited just over $40,000 from my mother who died in Germany. I 
want to invest in real estate. As a U.S. immigrant almost 15 years ago, and now 
a proud U.S. citizen, I appreciate what great opportunities this country offers 
compared to my homeland. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I bought our home about six years ago and it has been our best 
investment, except for our three children, of course. But we are uncertain how 
to invest this $40,000. We have very adequate income, over $100,000 in liquid 
assets such as CDs and money market accounts, and we have a $30,000 bank credit 
line plus credit cards for use in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
We are debating if we should use the $40,000 as a down payment on a rental 
house. Or perhaps you can suggest something else. What do you recommend is the 
best way for us to earn maximum real estate profits for the long term? 
</P>
<P>
A: Congratulations on your success since immigrating to the United States. I 
find it amazing how hard immigrants will work to become successful here, as 
compared to some of us lazy native-born Americans. But now I'll get down off my 
soapbox and answer your question. 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, fix-up houses are the best real estate investments. However, I 
hasten to add, only houses that can be upgraded at minimal cost should be 
acquired as investments. Your goal should be to add at least $2 of market value 
for each $1 of upgrading cost. 
</P>
<P>
Look for houses needing basic work such as painting, repairing, cleaning and 
landscaping. Avoid houses which need major structural work, although they can 
be profitable if you buy at a low enough price. 
</P>
<P>
After you have upgraded the house, then you can decide to either keep it as a 
long-term investment (called a "keeper") or sell the house for a quick profit 
(called a "flipper"). Either way, it is hard not to be successful if you buy at 
a low enough price to earn a handsome profit after the fix-up work is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Leases Not Good for Landlords 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband and I are considering buying an apartment building. We realize 
apartments are not especially profitable, but we want a place to park our 
money, perhaps benefit from market value appreciation and get a little tax 
shelter too. We found a very nice, luxury 12-unit building in top condition. 
</P>
<P>
But the problem is many of the apartments are leased for up to five years to 
what I call blue-hair rich little old ladies. I feel these long leases hurt the 
building's potential. What do you think? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think you are correct. Long-term leases benefit tenants more than 
landlords. If you buy that building you will have to honor those long-term 
leases. 
</P>
<P>
As a general rule, luxury apartment buildings are not good investments. In 
addition to the difficulty of renting expensive apartments, tenants in 
high-class buildings usually expect more services than do tenants in 
lower-class buildings. I realize the luxury building you are considering is 
probably a pride of ownership building but that type of property usually is not 
a profitable investment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Risks of Limited Partnership Deals 
</P>
<P>
Q: A friend has invested in a small group which earned over $50,000 profit on 
the sale of an apartment building which was upgraded and resold within a year. 
The same developer is now offering a similar limited partnership on another 
apartment building. Do you think I should invest? 
</P>
<P>
A: I cannot advise whether or not you should make a specific investment. 
However, you should realize that when you invest in a real estate limited 
partnership you are placing your fate in the hands of the general partner who 
manages the investment. Personally, I do not like group investments, as I 
prefer to buy properties alone so I can make my own mistakes.

HELP NEEDED TO PAY DISABLED MOTHER'S RENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL, Campbell, a retired Times staff writer, is a Phoenix-based 
free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: We own a condominium that's not quite paid for and we rent it to my 
mother. She isn't able to work and lives on a small pension ($350 per month). 
We don't want to sell because Mom wouldn't have any place else to go. 
</P>
<P>
But two mortgage payments are too much for us. I still owe $95,000 on my home. 
</P>
<P>
Where can we go to get help for my mother? I have contacted all of the local 
agencies (such as the Salvation Army, etc.). Mom desperately needs help, but 
the local agencies are all out of money. What can I do if the bank starts 
pushing me on the loan on the condo? Mother is 64 years old with a severe back 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: I think the first place for you to start is the Social Security 
Administration to see if your mother is eligible for SSI (Supplemental Security 
Income). This is a cooperative effort between various states and Social 
Security to provide funds that will help to close the gap between an older 
person's income and her basic needs. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the states, such as California, have a relatively high minimum income 
standard -- that is, the elderly person can have a fairly high monthly income 
and still qualify for SSI payments. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Medicaid, for the indigent, SSI eligibility doesn't have a "means" test 
-- a maximum on the resources that the applicant can own. SSI is based, purely 
and simply, on how much monthly income the person has. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, SSI isn't available to anyone younger than 65 but this doesn't apply 
to your 64-year-old mother because she is considered disabled. You don't 
specify the source of that "small pension," but, for Social Security's 
purposes, it doesn't matter -- it can, in fact, be a Social Security survivor's 
benefit without disqualifying her. 
</P>
<P>
Call Social Security's "hot line" for more information: (800) 234-5772. Other 
than that, the only solution I can suggest is that you move her in with you and 
sell the condominium. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strategy for Looking at Distressed Homes 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are interested in buying a distressed house. What is the best way to get 
a list of distressed homes in the Sacramento area? We would like to be able to 
drive through the neighborhoods of the homes without a real estate agent and 
pre-select some houses to look at before actually going through the homes. 
</P>
<P>
A: It's a good strategy, particularly if you aren't familiar with the city. Go 
to the library and look up the address of the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development in Sacramento. Send them a long, stamped, self-addressed envelope 
and ask for a list of the properties that they are trying to get off the books. 
Also, you might want to check with the advertising department of the Sacramento 
newspaper (The Bee) and see if HUD isn't running display ads listing such 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sell Home Before Urgent Need to Move 
</P>
<P>
Q: In 1988, at the age of 41, and single, I bought a house in a subdivision -- 
two bedrooms, one-and-a-half baths, a living room with a cathedral ceiling, 
with a one-car garage on a corner lot. The house cost $62,000 and I paid 
$20,000 down. My payment is $386 a month. 
</P>
<P>
My problem is that I am alone, here, my family is in New York and my father is 
very sick. If I were living in an apartment I would move back today -- but I 
have this house and no one to turn to for help. Can you tell me what I can do 
in case I have to go back on a minute's notice? 
</P>
<P>
A: Don't wait until you have to make such a move "on a minute's notice." There 
is obviously nothing binding you to either the house, or the locale, so you 
might as well pave the way in anticipation of what you see as an eventuality. 
</P>
<P>
Selling your home, either long-distance, or with a sense of urgency, puts you 
at a severe disadvantage. And, since you are thinking of going back to 
apartment living anyway, now is the time to start working on it. Take a look 
around your neighborhood and see which real estate company's signs seem to 
dominate the "For Sale" market and give them a ring. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Owner of Two Homes Wonders Which to Sell 
</P>
<P>
Q: For the past eight years I have divided my time between a condo I own in 
Florida and a home I own in Ohio. Now, approaching my 80th birthday, I am 
considering selling one of these properties so I can take advantage of the 
one-time $125,000 exclusion from capital gains. I legally established residence 
in Florida for tax reasons although I spend seven months a year at the Ohio 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
My question: Can I take the capital gains advantage on the sale of my home in 
Ohio or am I limited to taking it on the condo in Florida? I would have a 
larger capital gain on the home in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
A: At first glance, this seems fairly elemental: Your "principal residence" 
would be defined as the home that is your legal residence -- the condo in 
Florida, in your case -- right? 
</P>
<P>
You'd think so, except that for purpose of taking advantage of the $125,000 
exclusion from capital gains, the Internal Revenue Service interprets 
"principal residence" as being the home where you spend the majority of your 
time. And seven months in Ohio, versus five months in Florida, would make the 
Ohio residence the eligible one. 
</P>
<P>
"Legal residence," or not, then, the IRS says you can take the one-time 
exclusion on the Ohio home, which it considers your principal residence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Is It Advantageous to Buy Brand Appliances? 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are remodeling our home with a view to selling it in a few years. How 
important is it to have "brand name" appliances in the kitchen? Or would chain 
store brands be acceptable? 
</P>
<P>
A: You are quite right in the importance that you put on appliances, in the 
opinion of Suzanne Brangham, author of "Housewise: The Smart Woman's Guide to 
Buying and Renovating Real Estate for Profit" (Perennial Library: $8.95). 
</P>
<P>
"Appliances," she says, "are expensive investments, whether you get top or 
bottom of the line, so don't waste good money on a cheap unit." Her further 
advice: Ask local appliance dealers (handling a variety of brands) which are 
the most popular, sell the best and have the lowest rate of complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Also, read Consumer Reports thoroughly before making a selection and make sure 
that anything you buy is backed up by the manufacturer's guarantee. An 
important "don't" -- don't make any bold statements when it comes to color. 
Stay away, she recommends, from olive green, harvest gold, copper, brown or red 
appliances and stick with white or almond.

<P>
Do you want to own a home and have good income, but you don't have a down 
payment? Or, do you have money to invest in real estate but you don't want to 
be concerned about managing property? 
</P>
<P>
The solution to both problems is called residence "equity sharing." This 
arrangement, authorized by Internal Revenue Code 280A, allows a non-resident 
co-owner-investor to make the down payment, and the resident co-owner to pay 
the expenses and maintain the property. 
</P>
<P>
All the co-owners can deduct their appropriate income tax deductions, thus 
saving on their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
In a customary equity sharing arrangement, the resident co-owner pays the 
mortgage payment, property taxes and repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
The non-resident co-owner typically makes the down payment but usually does not 
pay any of the expenses and repair costs, except for extraordinary expenses 
such as a roof replacement. 
</P>
<P>
The resident must pay to rent the non-resident's share of the home. This 
monthly rent is usually the same amount as the non-resident's portion of the 
monthly mortgage, property tax and insurance payments. 
</P>
<P>
The resident is entitled to itemized tax deductions for the resident's portion 
of the property taxes and mortgage interest paid, but not for the rent paid to 
the non-resident co-owner. 
</P>
<P>
The ownership split can be whatever percentage the co-owners decide, such as 
50-50, 25-75 or 33-67. 
</P>
<P>
But IRC 280A says all co-owners must hold title to the property if they are to 
claim income tax deductions for the residence. 
</P>
<P>
Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, partnership or living (inter vivos) trust 
ownership methods are allowed. But a lease-option cannot be used, since all 
co-owners must hold title to the property. 
</P>
<P>
The non-resident co-owner must report the rental income received from the 
resident co-owner on Schedule E of IRS form 1040. 
</P>
<P>
But the non-resident will have deductions for his share of the mortgage 
interest, property taxes, insurance and other expenses paid. In addition, the 
non-resident can depreciate his share of the home that is rented to the 
resident co-owner. Straight-line 27 1/2 year depreciation is currently allowed. 
The result will probably be a paper loss that can shelter up to $25,000 of the 
investor's ordinary income, such as wages, interest and dividends from income 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
The benefits for the resident co-owner include acquiring a home with no initial 
down payment, receiving income tax deductions for part of the mortgage interest 
and property tax payments, and eventually receiving full ownership of the home. 
</P>
<P>
Benefits for the non-resident investor include owning part of a residence that 
will probably appreciate in value, helping the resident eventually own the 
home, being entitled to tax benefits, such as the depreciation deduction and 
part of the mortgage interest, property tax and insurance payments, and not 
having any management and maintenance worry. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest potential equity sharing problem occurs if the resident doesn't 
make his monthly payments. Getting rid of a non-paying co-owner is not easy. 
Foreclosure doesn't work because you can't foreclose on a co-owner. Neither is 
eviction the solution because the evicted resident would still be a co-owner. 
If one of the co-owners becomes bankrupt, creditors can attack that co-owner's 
property share. 
</P>
<P>
A possible solution to the problem of a non-paying resident is a quiet title 
lawsuit. Another is a partition lawsuit. But the resident might persuade a 
sympathetic judge that the non-resident must buy out the resident's equity to 
gain title to the entire property. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the potential equity sharing problems between investors and 
residents, the ideal equity sharing situation is between parents and their 
adult children. 
</P>
<P>
Since everyone has known each other at least 20 years, the chances of major 
problems are minimized. However, trouble can develop if the resident adult 
offspring is married and a divorce occurs. But this potential problem can be 
covered in the equity sharing contract. 
</P>
<P>
There are no standard equity sharing agreements. But IRC 280A requires a 
written contract between co-owners. 
</P>
<P>
A real estate attorney can prepare an equity sharing agreement to include 
provisions for title ownership by all parties, names of all co-owners and their 
percentage share of ownership, a buy-out arrangement so either co-owner can buy 
out the other, provision for profit split within five to 10 years upon resale 
or refinancing of the residence, arbitration of any dispute, payment for 
capital improvements desired by the resident co-owner, provision for payment of 
extraordinary costs over $500, such as a roof replacement, and a rental 
contract for the resident to rent the non-resident co-owner's share of the 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Further ideas on equity sharing, including sample agreements, are available in 
the book "Equity Sharing" by Georgia Anderson and Sandra Lamb (Contemporary 
Books, Chicago, 1986, $6.95), available in stock or by special order at local 
bookstores.

HOW LONG SHOULD TAX RECORDS BE RETAINED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENNY L. KASS, Kass is a Washington lawyer and newspaper columnist 
specializing in real estate and tax matters. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Every year at this time I resolve to throw out the many volumes of 
records that I have been keeping for many years. However, I am concerned about 
my potential liability if I should throw out the wrong documents and then find 
that the Internal Revenue Service suddenly wants to see those very same items. 
What are my rights with respect to those documents? Do I have to keep them 
forever? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: The easy answer to your question is that, if space permits, you 
probably would be well advised to keep all of your records forever. 
</P>
<P>
However, this is not only impractical but also is unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the law requires that as long as a taxpayer's return is 
open for audit by the IRS, the taxpayer is obligated to keep his or her books 
and records. 
</P>
<P>
Oversimplified, there is a three-year statute of limitations. If the three 
years have expired, and the IRS is no longer permitted to examine your returns 
for a particular year, then there is no need to keep all of your documentation. 
</P>
<P>
However, the IRS may be permitted to go beyond the three years if, for example, 
the taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed one that is considered to 
be fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
The tax for that year can be audited -- and assessed -- at any time. 
Additionally, if a taxpayer does not report an amount of income and such amount 
is more than 25% of the income shown on the tax return, the statute of 
limitations does not expire until six years after the return is filed. 
</P>
<P>
Under the general period of limitations, however, most tax records need only be 
kept by the taxpayers for only three years after they file their tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
For example, records relating to information on a timely filed 1987 tax return 
(Form 1040) should be kept until at least April 16, 1990. Keep in mind, 
however, that if you obtain an extension of the April 15 deadline, the three 
years are calculated from the date of the extension due date. 
</P>
<P>
Some records must, by necessity, be kept for a much longer time. 
</P>
<P>
For taxpayers involved in real estate transactions -- whether for principal 
residence or investment -- clearly the records must be kept from the date of 
purchase or acquisition until at least three years beyond the date of sale. 
</P>
<P>
Because taxpayers are using such legal techniques as roll-overs and 
once-in-a-lifetime exemptions, it is critical to determine the basis (purchase 
price) when the property is ultimately sold. 
</P>
<P>
Also, because the tax on the sale of real estate is now ordinary income rather 
than capital gains, it is important to be able to document improvements to the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you purchased your house for $100,000 and put on a major 
addition worth $75,000, your basis in the property is $175,000.00. If you sell 
the property later and do not take advantage of a roll-over, then your profit 
is $25,000 ($200,000 minus $175,000). 
</P>
<P>
However, the burden of proof rests clearly on the taxpayer. It is not 
sufficient to tell the IRS auditor that you think you put $75,000 worth of 
improvements on the house some time in 1980. You will be required to produce 
proof of the costs of those improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, if you want to take advantage of the over-55 $125,000 exemption, it 
must be understood that you are taking this exemption away from the profits 
that you have made. Again, it is important to demonstrate what costs you 
incurred above and beyond the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
For example, items such as recording and transfer taxes, settlement and closing 
costs, such as title insurance and legal fees, are all legitimate items to be 
added so that you can raise your basis, and thus lower your profit. Again, 
however, the burden will be on the taxpayer to demonstrate the validity of 
these costs. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who buys a house is well advised to keep the settlement sheet in 
perpetuity -- or at least until the last house is sold and the applicable 
statute of limitations has expired. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of a recent case dealing with the non-deductibility of points paid 
to refinance a mortgage, it is also important to keep documentation on your 
refinance settlement. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you paid three points on a $100,000 refinance loan, you will 
have paid $3,000 at settlement. If the refinance loan was for 30 years, you 
have to divide the $3,000 by 30 years, and each year you will be entitled to 
deduct $100. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you sell the house any time before the expiration of the loan, the 
balance of the unclaimed deduction can legitimately be taken in the year that 
you sell the property. However, once again, the burden to produce proper 
records will be on the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
With respect to the tax returns themselves, I strongly recommend that these be 
kept forever. They are not bulky, do not take up a lot of room in storage, and 
you may periodically need to refer to those tax returns -- for purposes which 
may go beyond an IRS audit.

DESIGN LIGHTING TO ACCENT GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outdoor lights can dramatize your house and yard, letting you enjoy your garden 
or pool for longer periods during the day while increasing security. 
</P>
<P>
You can set up a lighting design of your own by using one of the new 
low-voltage lighting kits that contain all the essentials -- stake or mounted 
fixtures, transformer, cords and switches. 
</P>
<P>
One maker of the kits, Toro, has advice for ways to get the most pleasing and 
professional-looking results: 
</P>
<P>
First, draw a scale plan of your yard on graph paper, showing location of paths 
or walks, gardens, statuary and the house. 
</P>
<P>
Note any architectural details you'd like to play up or utility areas you want 
to play down. Identify focal points and lines of sight you want to emphasize. 
Then note where you think fixtures will do the best highlighting. 
</P>
<P>
Using the graph as a guide, set up the equipment and test it at night. 
Fine-tune the result by moving the fixtures until you're satisfied with the 
mood and effect. 
</P>
<P>
Lights can add depth to a shallow yard if you use brighter lights near the 
house and dimmer lights in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
"Uplighting" -- shining lights up into trees and bushes -- is best for creating 
emphasis and mood. 
</P>
<P>
"Downlighting," while not as dramatic, serves double duty for functional 
lighting in access areas such as paths and drives. 
</P>
<P>
Moonlighting -- shining a light down from a fixture high in a tree -- can 
diffuse light over a large area. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, cords need not be buried for safety, though for appearance you 
may want to conceal them in a shallow trench or cover them with gravel or wood 
chips. Cords should be buried under the turf where you may be mowing grass. 
</P>
<P>
The company's kits contain parts designed to snap together without tools, and 
you can begin with a starter kit and add more later. Fixtures come in durable 
plastics or redwood, with stakes to position them in the ground or mounts for 
trees and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The weatherproof low-voltage equipment is safe and economical and delivers both 
dim and bright lighting, Toro says. 
</P>
<P>
Optional features include timers or photoelectric sensors to turn the systems 
on automatically, motion detectors, wired and wireless remote controls, and 
indoor security alarms. 
</P>
<P>
Basic kits cost about $50; Toro estimates cost of an average installation at 
about $200.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cimarron at Rancho Acacias, a 112-unit development by Cimarron Homes Inc., is 
open in the master-planned community of Rancho Acacias in Murrieta, in southern 
Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Barry A. Berkus in what builder Wally Meads said is "as close to 
custom homes as (you) will find in the marketplace," the first phase of 18 
three-, four- and five-bedroom houses ranges in size from 2,450 to 2,855 square 
feet, and in price from $222,990 to $259,990. 
</P>
<P>
First-phase move-ins are scheduled for May/June. 
</P>
<P>
The houses have two- and three-car garages, oak kitchen cabinets, Euro-style 
plumbing fixtures, skylights, arches, formal dining areas and fireplaces in the 
living and family rooms. There are three exterior designs for each of the four 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
A sales office is open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily at 39680 Via Las Palmas, reached 
from the Los Alamos Road exit of the Escondido (215) Freeway.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is still dark. The moon, partially obscured by clouds, offers little light. 
Stars flicker vaguely in the sky. Street lights cast long, thin shadows on the 
streets. Swallows flit by, seeking food. 
</P>
<P>
Kuala Lumpur has begun to stir. 
</P>
<P>
Like other Asian cities, "K.L.," as it is known to residents, is lurching into 
the 21th Century, grabbing for the tail of a speeding global economy. But the 
capital of Malaysia, unlike a booming Oriental metropolis such as Singapore, 
has not turned its back on the traditions that are its soul. Rather, it has 
tried to fuse modern industry with history, Western business with Asian custom. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, K.L. has become a place where luxurious high-rise hotels are 
equipped with French pastry shops, closed-circuit color TV broadcasts in 
several languages and painted arrows point toward Mecca so that the religious 
can pray. 
</P>
<P>
It is a place where Islam is the state religion, yet where government-employed 
Muslim women wearing the purdah are not allowed to veil their faces because it 
could hinder communication. 
</P>
<P>
It's a place where one can dine on intensely spicy Malaysian noodles chased 
with German beer, followed by a night of steamy dancing at a darkened disco. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1857, when rich tin deposits were found here, this Southeast Asian city 
has progressed from a primitive boom town -- not unlike California's gold rush 
settlements -- to a British colony, to capital of the independent nation of 
Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
But rubber, palm oil, rice, timber, tin and, increasingly, manufactured goods, 
have not been enough to fuel the country's desire to be a Pacific Rim economic 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
Malaysia needs tourism, and to that end it has scheduled a series of festivals 
during 1990 as part of Visit Malaysia Year, a promotional campaign the country 
hopes will attract more foreign spenders. It's a good time to visit this 
flower-drenched city, which is rich with Asian culture and easy to explore. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
A solitary Indian-Muslim vendor, cool in his T-shirt and white cotton loincloth 
called a dhoti, walks briskly to his tea stall -- the faster the tea starts 
brewing, the better his business. 
</P>
<P>
It is nearly two hours before school begins, but already two female students 
are waiting for a bus. They are dressed in government-school 
turquoise-and-white uniforms; their veils identify them as Muslim. An early 
morning jogger stops for a breather on the bridge overlooking the Klang River. 
And those asleep in the tranquillity of the Jamek Mosque awaken and cleanse 
themselves in preparation for morning prayers. 
</P>
<P>
"Allahu Akbar . . . Allahu Akbar." The clear, resonant call of the muezzin -- 
"Allah is the mightiest of all" -- reverberates through the surrounding 
high-rises and the squat prewar structures circling this historic neighborhood 
. . . a place revered by the tourist and religious natives alike. 
</P>
<P>
Jamek Mosque was built in 1909, 52 years after Kuala Lumpur was founded where 
the Gombak and the Klang rivers meet. Like an Arabian Nights fantasy set 
against an oasis of swaying palms, it is a replica of a graceful northern 
Indian mosque -- walled courtyard, three domes, two minarets and a breezy, open 
prayer hall. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounding the mosque are modern financial institutions, their architectural 
forms reflecting the countries they represent: an American bank in a glitzy 
skyscraper; a British bank in a traditional Georgian structure and a Malaysian 
bank building blending Asian architectural styles, capped by a distinctive 
Sumatran-influenced pointed roof. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The narrow roads in this old section of Kuala Lumpur already are filling with 
traffic. Mini-vans crammed with commuters appear. A shopkeeper removes the 
planks covering his tiny, hole-in-the-wall space and opens for business. 
</P>
<P>
About a mile away from Jamek Mosque, passengers gather at the main railway 
station -- a grandiose, Moorish-style "palace" topped with domes and minarets, 
to meet trains filled with commuters or perhaps to board a train northbound for 
the island beach resort city of Penang, or to begin the journey 200 miles south 
to Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
By 7 a.m. the overnight train from Singapore has arrived. Passengers spill from 
the station to be immediately swallowed by waiting taxis. This pandemonium is 
known as the "government-servant" jam -- commuters who live in surrounding 
suburbs arriving for their jobs in Malaysian government offices. 
</P>
<P>
It is all a far cry from the 1920s scene reported in "A Journal in the Federal 
Capital," written by journalist George L. Peet: "So little traffic was there in 
the quiet and drowsy thoroughfare that Java Street (now Jalan Tun Perak) was in 
1929 that I could park my car outside my office all day and it was not until 
1934 that the police imposed a one-hour parking limit with a $2 fine for 
infringement." 
</P>
<P>
Kuala Lumpur did not emerge from its thatched-roof-village status until 1896, 
when it was declared administrative capital of the British-managed Federated 
Malay States. 
</P>
<P>
In 1957 it became the Federation of Malaya. In 1963 Malaysia was formed, 
bringing together Malaya with several other nearby states. In 1931 K.L.'s 
population was 112,000; today, it is more than a million. 
</P>
<P>
Like other urban areas of the world, the city has attracted migration from 
rural areas short on employment. Malays, Chinese and Indians interweave their 
cultures here. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974 K.L. became a federal district like Washington, D.C. But only in the 
1980s did K.L. blossom into a metropolis. Gleaming office structures began to 
multiply, adding a sophisticated sleekness. The number of luxury hotels and 
good restaurants increased, and the choice of night-time entertainment widened. 
Yet some things remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
At 10 a.m. the city starts to steam. The temperature rises to 80 degrees; the 
humidity is 80%. The old market at Chow Kit Road is in full bustle. Starting 
from the covered fresh-food section where you find meat, seafood and 
vegetables, the Chow Kit market spills out onto the street in a splendid, 
colorful bazaar of treasures from all over Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
You can buy strange herbs and roots that promise virility, aromatic seasonings 
that will blend into fragrant curry powders, exotic trinkets from faraway 
villages and everyday household goods such as pots and pans. 
</P>
<P>
"Mesti hujan hari ini . . .," says a trader, predicting rain today as he wipes 
the sweat from his brow and rearranges the songkoks -- traditional Malaysian 
pillbox hats -- he is selling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Office workers all over the city scurry to outdoor food stands that pepper the 
city. The open-air food stalls serve a dizzying variety of Asian foods. Diners 
walk away with paper plates loaded with fresh fruit or seasoned rice or complex 
curries. 
</P>
<P>
Meals take place wherever space allows: in parks, on benches, on wobbly picnic 
tables on the street. Despite the cloying heat, lunch time in Kuala Lumpur is a 
noteworthy event (food is always a preoccupation for Malaysians). In the 
perfectly balanced stalls, one can get fresh-cooked meals at prices that 
astound most Westerners. For example, nasi campur, which is vegetables, 
chicken, gravy and condiments served with rice, costs just $1.05. 
</P>
<P>
All over K.L., Chinese coffee shops -- small restaurants similar to our coffee 
shops -- are famed for their variety of Malaysian-Chinese specialties. One is 
prawn mee soup, a subtly flavored prawn broth filled with boiled noodles, 
shrimp, and egg and chicken slices, and topped with crispy fried onions. 
</P>
<P>
There is also fried kway teau -- a greasy but delicious thick rice-noodle dish 
seasoned with shellfish, shrimp, egg and sometimes chives. Or try wan tan mee, 
chicken rice, curry laksa, lobak (a sort of stuffed fried turnip) or popiah (a 
non-fried spring roll). 
</P>
<P>
For those who prefer Indian food, there are three kinds of restaurants. 
Indian-Muslim coffee shops are favorite breakfast haunts. They serve roti 
canai, a scrumptious, crispy white-flour pancake eaten with a thick lentil 
curry sauce. There is also murtaba, a pancake stuffed with minced chicken or 
mutton and cooked over a hot griddle. 
</P>
<P>
Indian "banana leaf" restaurants offer top value and are a must-stop. Mounds of 
rice, vegetables, meats and curries are piled on huge banana leaves, rather 
than plates. Then there are restaurants serving classic northern Indian 
cuisine: chicken tandoori, rice pilau, minced lamb, cauliflower and potatoes. 
The best place for sampling Indian dishes is in the "Little India" neighborhood 
on Masjid India Street, about a block away from Jamek Mosque. 
</P>
<P>
One of the two locations of an excellent Indian vegetarian restaurant, Devi 
Annapporna, is in the shopping area called Medan Tuanku, about eight blocks 
east of Little India. 
</P>
<P>
Quite a few Malaysians go to great lengths to satisfy their discriminating 
palates. Yong Tau Foo, for instance, is fish-stuffed tofu cakes and vegetables 
available at most Chinese coffee shops. 
</P>
<P>
But the best, the Orchard View Yong Tau Food at Ampang Village, is about six 
miles from the city center -- never too far for the food lover, even if lunch 
is only an hour. It is always packed. 
</P>
<P>
By 2 p.m., sated and happy, workers have returned to their offices. To get 
there, hail a cab and say: "Ampang Village Yong Tau Foo, off Jalan Ampang." 
It's open every day except Monday for lunch only. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Dark, dramatic clouds have gathered. Afternoon thunderstorms are common in 
K.L., so this comes as no surprise. Yet the tropical storm is always wondrous 
to watch and hear. Crashing thunder echoes through the Klang Valley, lightning 
cracks through a black sky and the wind whistles around the city, singing 
strange musical tones as it whips against high-rise window panes. 
</P>
<P>
Pedestrians run for cover from the sudden torrential rain. Motorcyclists take 
shelter beneath covered overpasses, and traffic slows to a crawl. Just when 
everyone is resigned to the rain, it stops as suddenly as it started, and Kuala 
Lumpur is beautifully cleansed. Frangipani flowers and hibiscus, the national 
flower, stand out in fresh splendor. The city sparkles. 
</P>
<P>
The afternoon rush hour has begun by 4:30, but not everyone heads for home. At 
the public tennis courts in Jalan Duta, an exclusive suburb north of town, 
groups of Malaysian yuppies -- many of whom were educated in England and the 
United States -- warm up for a couple of sets. Gyms and fitness centers start 
to fill. 
</P>
<P>
Others -- foreign expatriates and Malays alike -- head for drinking places such 
as the private Royal Selangor Club's pub, "The Spotted Dog." The nickname is 
thought to have originated in colonial days when a British officer's wife who 
frequented the club left her two Dalmatians tied up outside. 
</P>
<P>
After work, many Kuala Lumpurians also head for Lake Gardens, a lush park 
surrounding a lake just outside town, about 15 minutes by taxi from the city 
center. It has a well-maintained jogging track and exercise course with workout 
stations around the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
At an open-air auditorium in the park, a group of dancers practices modern 
choreographed steps to music from a large cassette player. Against the rhythm 
of this pop music, athletes repeatedly scale the theater steps outside. 
</P>
<P>
In the evenings, Lake Gardens is a great place to people-watch: families, 
children in the playground, lovers strolling and, always, young men and women 
hoping to meet each other. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Dusk comes and the sky darkens. Throughout the city, at empty parking lots or 
unused roads, food stalls are set up and opened for the evening -- their picnic 
tables brightened by colored plastic tablecloths. 
</P>
<P>
Lately the most popular spot for all-night alfresco dining is in Bangsar, about 
three miles from the city center in a thriving residential area between the 
city and suburban Petaling Jaya. Stalls, carefully regulated by the city, are 
clean and safe for tourists. 
</P>
<P>
The stalls can easily be reached by simply telling a taxi driver: "Bangsar Park 
McDonald's." The American fast-food outlets -- McDonald's, Kentucky Fried 
Chicken and Pizza Hut, among others -- are all contained in a row of shops. 
</P>
<P>
After the sun sets, Bangsar's food stalls -- in parking lots adjacent to the 
fast-food restaurants -- become one of the city's best places to savor Malay 
and Indian dishes. 
</P>
<P>
For excellent Indian vegetarian food, try a stall called Devi Annapporna. Among 
the more unusual choices is nasi kerabu, a rice dish from the state of Kelantan 
that's flavored with grated coconut and mint. Another is ayam percik, barbecued 
chicken spiced with tangy nut-flavored sauce, also from Kelantan, which is 
close to Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
For those who prefer a more elegant and expensive dining experience, Kuala 
Lumpur's five-star hotels have everything from Caesar salad (try it at the 
Continental restaurant at the Pan Pacific Hotel) and New Zealand rock oysters 
to sirloin steak and fillet of sole. 
</P>
<P>
As in most big cities, nightclubs and discotheques are expensive, but 
traditional Malaysian entertainment is free nightly at the Central Market, an 
enclosed, air-conditioned mall filled with shoppers searching for clothing or 
handicraft items and sampling snacks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
11:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
There still is activity in Kuala Lumpur's Chinatown a few blocks from the 
Central Market in the area believed to be among the oldest sections of the 
city. The first tin miners settled here in 1857, and at one time the area was 
full of brothels and gambling dens. Today it's an enormous night market and a 
haven for the imitation designer-label traders. 
</P>
<P>
Wander around the Chinese herbalist medicine stalls, where you can remed any 
yin or yang imbalance with a cup of bitter-tasting broth. 
</P>
<P>
At midnight, Jamek Mosque is as quiet as the early morning. The bright moon 
casts a romantic soft hue over its domes and minarets. The Klang River ripples 
on, joining the Gombak and flowing out to the Strait of Malacca. 
</P>
<P>
It has been another day of old traditions and new ways in Kuala Lumpur. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of hotels: 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Here are some of Kuala Lumpur's attractions worth a visit: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The National Museum has displays relating to Malaysian history, arts and 
crafts, weapons, wildlife and economics. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Sultan Abdul Samad building, a famous Moorish structure formerly home 
to government offices, is being transformed into a tourist and handicraft 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Malayan Railway Administration Headquarters, with its splendid Moorish 
architecture, houses administrative offices of the Railway Authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Sri Mahamariamman Temple, Malaysia's largest and most ornate Hindu 
temple, was built in 1873. Opposite the Hindu temple, the Taoist temple also is 
worth seeing. 
</P>
<P>
Getting around: 
</P>
<P>
Despite its spaghetti-like street layout, Kuala Lumpur is easy to explore 
because many of its residents speak English. Taxis are inexpensive and their 
drivers are well versed in the city's tourist destinations. Addresses are not 
necessary for major sites and most restaurants and hotels. Metered taxis start 
at 70 cents (20% more for air conditioning); add $1 for a radio cab. Mini-buses 
are cheap, about 20 cents for a short trip, but there are no printed schedules. 
Ask at bus stops but avoid public transport between 7 and 9 a.m. and 4 and 6 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
When to go: 
</P>
<P>
The rainy season begins in November and continues through the middle of 
January, so the best time to visit is after that, especially from the beginning 
of March through June. Special promotional prices are being offered this year 
in honor of Visit Malaysia Year. For example, a special railway pass is about 
$35 for 10 days, $75 for 30 days, first-class, good for unlimited use in 
Malaysia and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
Rental car companies are offering discounts, as is Malaysia Airlines, for 
travel within the country. Travelers with U.S. passports require no visa for 
visits of up to three months. 
</P>

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: AIRCRAFT SMOKING BAN WILL CUT AIR POLLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: PASSENGERS WILL BE ABLE TO BREATHE A LITTLE EASIER THANKS TO A NEW 
LAW THAT GOES INTO EFFECT TODAY BANNING SMOKING ON U.S. FLIGHTS OF LESS THAN 
SIX HOURS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If you're an airline passenger who smokes, you've probably already begun to 
panic. The deadline approached, the clock ticked away and now you are 
confronted with the awful truth. 
</P>
<P>
As of today, Feb. 25, a federal law is in effect that prohibits smoking on all 
airlines flying between any two airports in the United States if the flight 
lasts six hours or less. 
</P>
<P>
The old rule that banned smoking on all flights lasting two hours or less is 
history. The U.S. smoking ban is systemwide and applies to all airlines, 
foreign and domestic. 
</P>
<P>
The new law prohibits smoking on passenger airline flights of six hours or less 
in the U.S. The rule does not apply to international flights that arrive in or 
depart from U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
For example, you cannot smoke on a Pan Am flight from Los Angeles to New York. 
If that flight continues to Paris, smoking is allowed on the overseas leg. 
</P>
<P>
Some air carriers didn't wait for the law to take effect today. Pan Am began 
the ban Feb. 5. Northwest Airlines beat everyone when it made all its domestic 
flights nonsmoking in April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. flights still are exempt from the rule. Airlines that fly between 
Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis and Las Vegas and Honolulu could allow smoking on 
such flights, because they exceed six hours. 
</P>
<P>
American says it will permit smoking on its Dallas and Chicago flights to 
Honolulu. TWA will also allow smoking on its St. Louis-Hawaii runs. American, 
Pan Am and United are generally allowing smoking on flights to the Caribbean, 
Mexico and Canada; most of these flights last under six hours, but they are to 
foreign destinations. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some carriers that are even going beyond the new rule in 
extending the nonsmoking ban. 
</P>
<P>
Delta will not allow smoking on any of its flights in North America and the 
Caribbean. That effectively rules out smoking on all Delta flights to 
destinations in Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada and 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest won't allow smokers to light up on its Minneapolis-to-Hawaii flights. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is not required to do so, Virgin Atlantic Airways, which flies 
between New York, Newark and Miami to London, announced that it will become the 
first airline to offer an all nonsmoking service on service between New York 
and London. 
</P>
<P>
Starting May 18, the airline will introduce a second 747 on the Newark-Gatwick 
route and the plane will be designated nonsmoking. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been noticing a steady increase in passenger comments about cigarette 
smoking on board our aircraft," said Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman. "We 
wanted to make a firm stand by offering a choice of smoking or nonsmoking 
departures." 
</P>
<P>
If the Newark nonsmoking service proves successful, Virgin will add nonsmoking 
London flights to and from New York's Kennedy airport, Miami, and, later this 
year, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government has gone a step further. Effective July 1, smoking will 
be banned on all Canadian registered commercial passenger aircraft -- 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
What will be the impact of the new nonsmoking regulations? 
</P>
<P>
First, if you're a frequent flyer, the smoking ban may open more window and 
aisle seats previously allocated to smokers. 
</P>
<P>
The smoking ban also will allow some more domestic airlines to introduce 
business class. Only TWA offers systemwide business class compartments on its 
wide-body aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps most important will be the short- and long-term health impact of 
the smoking ban on airline passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Flight crews also will benefit. In March, 1988, a study commissioned by the 
Aviation Safety Institute, a nonprofit industry watchdog group, determined that 
cigarette smoke reduces the blood oxygen levels of pilots and flight attendants 
and could adversely affect their judgment. 
</P>
<P>
One hope is that with smoke no longer circulating through airplane cabins, 
fewer of us will emerge from our flights with sore eyes, sore throats and 
colds. 
</P>
<P>
But therein lies a continuing problem of airline ventilation. Smoke is only one 
irritant drifting around airline cabins. It is often joined by high levels of 
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and ozone. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, flying inside an airline cabin for long periods is tantamount to being 
stuck inside an aluminum petri dish. An inordinately high concentration of 
bacteria, fungi and viruses are often detected in airline cabins. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: poor ventilation, poor cleaning and maintenance of air conditioning 
systems and filters and less-than-full use of those systems by airlines during 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
In an ideal situation fresh air is drawn into the airplane via engine intakes, 
filtered and regulated to the correct temperature, then pumped into the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
But more often than not, many airlines don't want to use the energy to do that. 
Instead, these airlines recycle the air. When airlines don't clean their air 
filters properly and regularly the problem of poor quality cabin air is 
compounded. 
</P>
<P>
A Boeing 747 has three "airpacs" -- air-conditioning and ventilation systems. 
But how many airlines use all three in flight? Very few. 
</P>
<P>
The smoking ban is a good start toward cleaner cabin air but it is only a first 
step. 
</P>
<P>
The next time you fly, ask a flight attendant if all the airpacs are being 
used. If not, complain. Then we'll all be able to breathe a little easier.

HOOKED ON FLOATING FISHING LODGE

KINGCOME INLET, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We were sky-dancing between the clouds, the mountains and the foaming sea, up 
the British Columbian coast in a powerful twin otter. 
</P>
<P>
From the silt-laden Fraser River we zoomed north from Vancouver over the 
Sechelt Peninsula, with its hundreds of sea farms and log booms scattered along 
the coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Civilization dwindled rapidly, its only evidence being the decades worth of 
clear-cutting scars and the hot pink mist of the ensuing fireweed. Over the 
noise of the engines the men -- I was the only woman on board -- were yelling 
their newly invented fish stories to each other. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot made a sharp, knee-weakening arc to the right and landed in the water 
beside Cracroft Island. 
</P>
<P>
As the plane taxied up to the pier I noticed huge casket-like styrofoam boxes 
-- piles and piles of them -- surrounded by a large group of very happy people. 
It was the last group of fishermen and their catch. 
</P>
<P>
This was North Pacific Springs, a floating fishing lodge operated by former 
airline owner Keith Fraser. A tugboat tows Fraser's 15-room lodge to where he 
can guarantee good salmon fishing in British Columbia. As summer sets in, the 
snows of Mt. Washington melt and water pours into Kingcombe Inlet, diluting its 
salinity and touching off the salmon migration. 
</P>
<P>
Guests fish from the pier of the lodge, which is moved from various locations 
between Kingcome Inlet and Knight's Inlet. It's an area where fishermen can 
observe abundant wildlife and explore eerie abandoned indian villages, 
petroglyphed channels and fish farms. 
</P>
<P>
The lodge is comfortable and clean, with private bathrooms and a large communal 
Jacuzzi. An open bar and good, home-cooked food are the order of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The bewhiskered Fraser, after decades of flying and fishing the northern 
British Columbian coastline, looks the part of bushwhacker extraordinaire. He 
greeted us heartily and ushered us onto the lodge. His trophy Tyees and huge 
bearskin rugs lined the dining room. I smelled the tantalizing fragrance of 
freshly steamed shellfish and home-baked bread. 
</P>
<P>
By the time I unpacked I couldn't wait to eat. Between slurping buttery fresh 
oysters and wiping my glasses as sweet Dungeness crab juice spurted across the 
table (the lodge has its own crab pots dotting various inlets), I knew that I'd 
been dropped into "Fisherman Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the men had fished all over the world and they were here for only one 
thing -- to catch a Tyee salmon, no matter how early they had to get up or how 
wet they got. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser was there to help in any way possible, providing superb $300 reels, long 
and limber rods and fast boats that drive through the deep cold water that 
flows through Johnstone Strait and surrounds Cracoft Island. But above all, he 
provided an unerring sixth sense about where the fish were. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a timid knock that woke us up the next morning at 5, it was a serious 
bang on the door. Then there came the nose tickling aroma of fresh coffee and 
fruit-filled muffins baking. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his infirmities, even Wyman, the 80-year-old lawyer from Los Angeles, 
crawled out of bed to inch his way to sustenance before tackling the steps down 
to the huge pier and loading area. 
</P>
<P>
Tom, one of the jovial Californians in our group, explained that even though 
he'd once caught a 1,400-pound marlin with a 45-pound tuna as bait (itself 
larger than any fish I've ever even reeled in), fishing is such an incurable 
malady that, once stricken, a person travels the world to satisfy the 
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
All I knew was that I hated baiting hooks with squirming worms, and now I was 
about to demonstrate my ineptitude in front of the elite of the angling 
fraternity. 
</P>
<P>
Gray dawn covered Blackfish Sound as Dave, our guide, set the lines. "Say, this 
is OK," I thought, "I don't have to touch that slimy dead fish." Kidding me all 
the while, Dave whipped up a contraption that was a combination of a "little 
pink hoochie to attract big pink fishies" and a silver flasher that I dutifully 
dropped off the stern of the boat. Meanwhile, we attended each of the 
downriggers, baited with herring, a chinook's favorite snack. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing for salmon is much like Fraser says: "Hours of boredom, sparked by 
moments of sheer terror." The reason is simple. Huge chinook salmon are lazy 
fish. They're down there -- the depth finder/sonar gizmo says so. But they just 
open their massive mouths and dinner flows in. 
</P>
<P>
You almost have to hit them on the head with the downrigger to get them to 
strike. Cruising in the sparkling clear sunlight, I fished and waited. Not for 
long. 
</P>
<P>
Pink after pink hit the deck -- five, eight, 10-pound beautiful fish filled my 
tub, perfect for the smoking and canning that the lodge arranges. And by the 
end of that first afternoon I realized that I'd almost caught the limit. So 
what else to do? 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, on our way out to pull some crab traps, Keith had mentioned an 
abandoned indian village. So guide Brian and I commandeered a boat and struck 
out for the Kwakiutl village of Mamalillaculla. 
</P>
<P>
Maneuvering through the brooding granite boulders that protected the ancient 
village site, we anchored the boat beside one of the three burial islands and 
leaped onto the barnacle-crusted rocks at high tide. 
</P>
<P>
A recently built, concrete-block crypt stood sentinal above us. Stark and cold, 
it watched over the emerald green islands strewn across the bay and the 
mountains of Vancouver Island that rose in the distant blue haze. 
</P>
<P>
Behind, a narrow path stole higher into the island forest. Something drew us to 
follow that path until, in the darkness, a weathered wooden structure arose, a 
windowless house for the dead. The side had been chain-sawed off and so it 
showed its hand-hewn cedar timbers. Around the building, bits of rotting, 
wine-colored cloth littered the forest floor. The shattered roof lay stacked 
crudely, gathering lichen. 
</P>
<P>
Set aside from the destruction was a careful arrangement of what appeared to be 
human bones. It looked as if this had once been a holy place, a place the 
ghosts had fled. 
</P>
<P>
The tide was ebbing fast, so Brian suggested a visit to the fish farm in a 
channel where the current runs quickly. Its pens were filled with 30- to 
40-pound brood salmon. Not not as muscular as the wild salmon, but certainly as 
beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
It was time to return to the lodge. With our hair flying, we were powering 
homeward through a strengthening gale when Brian suddenly wheeled the boat. 
Within 100 yards of us a huge pod of killer whales were feasting on the salmon 
we were supposed to be catching. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the lodge we feasted on succulent giant prawns and thick steak that 
Keith said he had "flown into town for." The aches of fishing were forgotten as 
new friendships were cemented and fish stories swapped in the swirling waters 
of the hot tub. 
</P>
<P>
Another morning, another familiar knock on the door, and out into the dark we 
trooped. It seemed like midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Tom, the tanned, handsome, Californian, had taken it upon himself to teach me 
how to bait a hook several nights before, so when one of his buddies asked, "Do 
you want to go fishing?" I immediately responded, "Just let me get my floater 
coat!" 
</P>
<P>
Between us we needed only five fish to fill our legal limit, so we were mostly 
going out with the idea of just having fun. As it turned out, there was nothing 
but mayhem on our 17-foot boat. 
</P>
<P>
I turned the boat too quickly and tangled all our lines in the propeller. Tom, 
tail end up and head almost in the water, couldn't stop laughing, and from that 
moment we became good friends. 
</P>
<P>
He steered us to the deeper water off Flower Island and calmly rigged our lines 
again. Immediately, hungry fish began to pull and tug as we roller-coastered 
around the boat, ducking and handing lines over and under. Wonder of wonders, 
we landed every fish. 
</P>
<P>
Over the noise of the boat, our whoops of joy and the wind, we heard a terrific 
yell from one of the other boats bobbing in the brilliantly cold morning 
sunshine. Gary, another Californian, had hooked what seemed to be a record 
breaker. Young Brian, who had only officially been guiding for two weeks, 
jockeyed his boat and instructed the fisherman how to brace himself for the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
Blackfish Sound echoed with the screaming of the reel as the big fish peeled 
off 1,200 feet of line -- right down to the knot. Dragging the boat into deeper 
and deeper water, the fight continued to the death. 
</P>
<P>
When the triumphant, exhausted crew arrived back into the small clutch of boats 
under the slightly jealous eyes of the older guides, a new North Pacific 
Springs record had been set: 61 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Our group caught five enormous Tyee salmon, one by Wyman, the 80-year-old 
gentleman. Masses of smaller 5 to 25 pounders, several large sweet-fleshed 
halibut and even a few ugly ling cod were brought in. The spiny rock fish were 
flung to the waiting bald eagles. 
</P>
<P>
Smoked, canned or frozen, our fish were loaded into the little seaplane so 
tightly that the aisles were packed. As we floated over the mountaintops, I 
looked around. 
</P>
<P>
Every fisherman had his ear protectors on and was fast asleep, awash in his 
personal fish dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Several all-inclusive packages are available for North Pacific Springs. Some 
include fishing for steelhead in a mountain stream and cooking your catch on 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
Salmon fishing season starts at the end of April and lasts to October. Fly in 
from Vancouver International Airport's South Terminal via Harbour Air. For 
details and/or reservations contact: North Pacific Springs, Box 928, 351

RUSSELL, New Zealand 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three hours by car north of Auckland lies the town of Russell, known a century 
ago to sailors and whaling men as the "hellhole of the Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
The picture in 1990 is one of a pastoral city of 1,000 souls, fronting one of 
the myriad bays of the Bay of Islands. Russell was also the first capital of 
New Zealand and has some historic landmarks that represent New Zealand's soul. 
</P>
<P>
On its main street, friendly citizens constantly ask: "Isn't it lovely?" or 
"Aren't we lucky?" or "Isn't this God's country?" Even the most hard-bitten 
traveler can't argue with them. 
</P>
<P>
Fine walks lead visitors through the bush -- along its rivers and seashore, 
carefully marked, meticulously manicured. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay of Islands was discovered by Capt. Cook in 1796. Since his appearance 
the subsequent path of history follows the usual pattern of foreign intruders 
clashing with the locals, in this case the Maoris. 
</P>
<P>
The appearance of missionaries was, of course, predictable, and Russell today 
has four churches. The town's character is gentle and civilized, with one fine 
library, two small museums and several galleries selling crafts -- quilts, 
baskets, jade and woodwork. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay of Islands is a mosaic of 345 islands, most of them featuring 
individual beaches. From the air it resembles a vast patchwork of water -- 
green and blue, with the most spectacular sunrises and sunsets in the Pacific 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
And the climate is balmy. In December, for example, the average temperature was 
82 degrees, with 80-degree water. The entire complex is a haven for yachtsmen, 
fishermen, campers and hikers. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay of Islands is not pretentious. It has no high-rise resorts, no 
restaurants with nouvelle cuisine. Nature reigns supreme. New Zealand won't let 
the entrepreneur sublimate it. 
</P>
<P>
Buses and ferries abound. Russell, which can be done on foot, has much to 
offer. Christ Church, diminutive and white, the oldest church in New Zealand, 
is set in a cemetery and framed by jacaranda trees and bougainvillea. Still in 
use, it is an excellent example of Gothic design. 
</P>
<P>
The Custom House on the waterfront, built in 1870, is a fine Victorian 
structure serving as the Police Station but with only one policeman, who lives 
in the station. 
</P>
<P>
At the entrance of the Returned Services Assn. (the New Zealand American 
Legion) is a sign that states: "A neat and tidy standard of dress is required. 
Not acceptable: overalls, singlets, bathing attires, bare feet, denim jackets, 
scruffy jeans, gum boots. Non-compliance with the above will earn the 
displeasure of the executive. Welcome to the Russell R.S.A." 
</P>
<P>
At the Bistro, a favorite of locals (fish and chips for $4.50, six fresh Orongo 
oysters for $6.50), two signs are posted on the back bar. One reads: "Any 
person involved in disorderly behavior will be suspended three months, 
minimum." The second states: "No mugs after 9:45," meaning liters of beer. 
</P>
<P>
Some hints for tourists visiting Russell: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Because motorists use left lanes, be cautious while crossing streets. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A takeaway is an establishment selling fast food. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The ozone layer is thin in this part of the world, so remember to heed the 
daily weather report that warns of sunburn. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's national carrier, Air New Zealand, will jet you from Los Angeles 
to Auckland in less than 12 hours. (Flights are almost always full during the 
high season, so book early.) 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations in Russell are clean, efficient and modestly priced by American 
standards, with many rooms and suites facing the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Hananui Lodge features four suites (living room, bath and kitchen) and 
balconies that face the water. In-season rates are $87 New Zealand (about $50 
U.S.) a night, double occupancy. You'll get magnificent sunsets here and a 
chance to watch the endless marine activities on the bay. Write to The Strand, 
P.O. Box 16, Russell, Bay of Islands, New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Duke's Lodge also has waterfront suites and a swimming pool. Rates are about 
the same as the Hananui Lodge (reduced for long stays). Write to P.O. Box 52, 
Russell, Bay of Islands, New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
The Duke of Marlborough Hotel, oldest in Russell, has 52 rooms at $52 New 
Zealand a night. Overlooking the bay, its porch is a fine spot for afternoon 
tea. Write Box 52, Russell, Bay of Islands, New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia Lodge is a 19th-Century homestead set in a colorful garden overlooking 
Matauwhi Bay. Just a five-minute walk from Russell, this hotel is a favorite 
with New Zealanders, with both private and shared baths. Rates are $35 to $50 
N.Z. Write to Arcadia Lodge, Russell, New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Dinners at many good restaurants cost between $10 and $12 N.Z. The Duke of 
Marlborough serves luncheon on its veranda (try the oysters or the pate a la 
Maison or Camembert Korokarera, crumbled and served with a tangy fruit sauce). 
</P>

TRAVEL VIDEOS: ARMCHAIR VISITS TO THE FAR EAST AND HIMALAYAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY MARTIN, Martin is a former staff member of the Travel Section. Her 
column on travel videos appears monthly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One nice thing about travel by video is that you can visit any place you want, 
any time you want. You don't have to follow traditional routes. This month, our 
connecting flights of fantasy take us from the Far East and the Himalayas to 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
"Portraits of the Great Far East" (International Travel Films, 85 minutes, 
1989). The quality of Doug Jones' travelogue is first-rate and, combined with 
his excellent narration, provides the viewer not only with a scenic journey but 
a better appreciation of the culture and history of some of the most popular 
destinations in the Far East. It also can be of help to those in the early 
stages of planning a trip. 
</P>
<P>
The first stop is cosmopolitan Tokyo and includes visits to the Imperial 
Palace, the Ginza area and Buddhist temples, and a short train ride to view the 
Great Buddha and the religious center of Kamakura. 
</P>
<P>
That is followed by a trip to the southern island of Kyushu and the town of 
Kagoshima for colorful festival scenes and a look at the still-active volcano 
of Sakurajima, a tea ceremony at Iso Gardens and a visit to watch porcelain 
being made. A return to Tokyo provides a look at the night life on the Ginza, 
from Kabuki to Broadway shows. 
</P>
<P>
In Korea, viewers are shown the pastoral countryside of this "Land of the 
Morning Calm," and the city of Kyongju with its many temples and fascinating 
cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
The video next moves to Singapore for street scenes that show the Raffles 
Hotel, original home of the Singapore Sling drink, plus modern hotels, old 
alleys, Chinatown and duty-free shops combined with beautiful parks, all of 
which reflect the high standard of living enjoyed in this island city. 
</P>
<P>
The next stop is Bangkok, Thailand, where temple spires pierce the skyline and 
klongs (canals) are the major thoroughfares. Stops include the Rose Garden -- a 
colorful, cultural and entertainment center -- and a visit to the Royal Palace. 
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong there are the obligatory scenes of the crowded harbor, where navy 
ships, junks, cruise ships and ferries vie for space, and traditional herbal 
and snake shops contrast with modern shopping districts. 
</P>
<P>
There are side trips to Aberdeen, which is crowded with boat people and 
fishermen, and Kowloon in the more rural New Territories, to visit the Sung 
Dynasty Village, where viewers see examples of old-style Chinese culture and 
traditions. 
</P>
<P>
A return to Hong Kong gives viewers a look at the subway system and duty-free 
shopping (including the renowned tailors), and a sample of the varied night 
life along Nathan Road. 
</P>
<P>
Kuala Lumpur is the major stop in Malaysia, where the crowded streets are lined 
with Islamic mosques. Rubber and tin are the foundation of the economy, and 
many kinds of pewter objects are displayed. Also visited are the Batu Caves 
north of Kuala Lumpur, where Hindus practice their religion. 
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka gets brief coverage, and the narration points out its current 
troubles while showing scenes of the capital city of Colombo and rural farms, 
where methods have remained unchanged for centuries. There's also a visit to 
Kandy to see the Temple of the Tooth, snake charmers and the famous Kandian 
dancers. 
</P>
<P>
India is the last stop. Scenes of Madras show a "land of poverty and want" 
that, according to the narration, is still a "fascinating spot." 
</P>
<P>
Sacred cows, temples, a belief in reincarnation and the use of camels provide 
some of the colorful threads that make up the fabric of India. The final 
contrasting scenes are of Agra and the spectacularly beautiful Taj Mahal. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' films were made for showing in theaters and have not been edited for 
video viewing. There are no hotel or restaurant recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes, and a brochure of his other videos, are available from International 
Travel Films, P.O. Box 39402, Los Angeles 90039, (213) 663-4334. Price: $29.95. 
</P>
<P>
"Exploring the Himalayas -- Nepal and Kashmir" (Questar Video Inc., 1989). A 
visit to the mystical Himalayas is an adventure, even by video. Drawn by the 
lure of awesome Mt. Everest and by James Hilton's illusive Shangri-La, more and 
more tourists are exploring this remote corner of the world. For armchair 
travelers, this video is a worthy substitute. 
</P>
<P>
Against a background of scenes of the majestic, snow-covered mountains and 
their peoples, the narration provides information on such things as the 
history, geology, climate and religions that play such important roles in the 
culture and economy. 
</P>
<P>
Buddhism and Hinduism are the predominant religions, and countless rituals and 
festivals plus 40 languages and numerous dialects add color and intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
Srinigar, the capital of India's northern state of Kashmir (a site of current 
unrest), is where the video journey begins, showing the vibrant streets and 
waterways and the lovely gardens around Dal Lake, where lake dwellers live in 
houseboats and travel by native craft and water taxis. 
</P>
<P>
From Srinigar, viewers share a ride on a rickety bus (along a treacherous dirt 
road) on a two-day trip over mountain passes to the city of Leh, in Ladakh, on 
the arid Indus River plain, a land dotted with early Tibetan-Buddhist 
monasteries. 
</P>
<P>
Also from Srinigar is a breathtaking nine-day trek, most of which is at more 
than 12,000 feet, to the spectacular Zanskar Valley, recently opened to 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers see the primitive farming methods, religious rituals and life styles of 
the hardy villagers of this isolated valley. There also are scenes showing the 
daily routine of the monastic monks and of the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader 
of Tibetan Buddhism. 
</P>
<P>
The video next moves to Nepal, birthplace of Buddha, where eight of the world's 
10 highest mountains are found. Street scenes in Katmandu show ancient temples, 
and in adjacent Patan we see intricately carved pagodas, a legacy of early 
Newar artisans. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, viewers are shown the encroaching Western influence of a cola 
bottling plant and modern hotels. The "hidden lanes" of Katmandu, however, 
retain the early trading-center atmosphere, as merchants crowd sidewalks to 
sell everything from flowers and food to haircuts. 
</P>
<P>
Religious sights include a huge Vishnu shrine, the major Hindu temple of 
Pashupatinath and the Bodhnath and Swayambhunath stupas (Buddhist shrines) with 
their characteristic eyes of Buddha painted on the exteriors. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers also see the colorful festival of Indra Jatra and the Kumari, the girl 
child who represents a Hindu goddess. 
</P>
<P>
There are also visits to a pottery market in nearby Bhaktapur and a bronze shop 
to watch artisans at work. 
</P>
<P>
There are few highways in Nepal, so trekking is the best way to see the 
country. A popular trek, which takes three weeks to a month, follows a group 
via Annapurna Mountain to villages and the valley of the Kali River, where 
there is a mystical shrine. 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights include a visit to villages of the famed Ghurka soldiers, a 
wild river-rafting trip and an elephant ride in the animal sanctuary of Chitwan 
National Park. 
</P>
<P>
The final scenes take in Mt. Everest and the engaging Sherpa guides. When they 
are not guiding treks they are shown as farmers, shopkeepers, artisans and 
participants at a Tibetan-Buddhist festival. 
</P>
<P>
There are no travel or hotel recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from Questar Travel Network, P.O. Box 11345, Chicago, Ill. 
60611, toll-free (800) 544-8422. Price: $29.95. 
</P>
<P>
"Switzerland" (Video Visits, International Video Network, 1989, 58 minutes). 
This is a video that will tempt the most root-bound armchair traveler to get up 
and go. In addition to its fine natural beauty, Switzerland -- bordered by 
France, Germany, Austria and Italy -- has absorbed some of the culture of its 
neighbors, giving each of its areas an intriguingly different flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Zurich is the first stop on this summer tour. Viewers visit its elegant 
shopping district, craft shops, museums, opera house and St. Peter's Cathedral 
with its huge clock face, then head for Schaffhausen and the spectacular Rhine 
Falls close to the German border. 
</P>
<P>
The German influence also is evident in Lucerne. Scenes include the Kapellbruke 
(bridge), the grotto with the "Dying Lion" sculpture, a ferry ride on Lake 
Lucerne and a visit to a wedding celebration. 
</P>
<P>
At Interlaken and Grindelwald, viewers see mountain climbers and glaciers in 
the Jungfrau region and listen to a yodeling contest against a backdrop of 
beautiful Alpine scenery. 
</P>
<P>
The arcaded streets of the capital city of Bern offer scenes of the colorful 
vegetable and flower markets, clock tower and Parliament building. These are 
followed by a visit to Morat fortress for a magnificent view of the 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
It's the French influence that is seen and heard in the town of Neuchatel, a 
clock-making and wine-making center. Farther south in the French border 
country, viewers visit Lausanne and Geneva on Lake Geneva. At Lausanne, you see 
scenes of the Cathedral of Notre Dame and the nearby Castle of Chillon, 
featured in Lord Byron's poem. 
</P>
<P>
In cosmopolitan Geneva, a center of international organizations, scenes include 
elegant shops, the university, Geneva flower clock and the Cathedral of St. 
Pierre, built in AD 400, under which archeologists are shown excavating still 
older structures. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers then visit the resort town of Zermatt for vistas of the spectacular 
Matterhorn seen from the town and cable cars, followed by a look at some 
apres-ski activities. 
</P>
<P>
The video then visits the Swiss Riviera on Lake Lugano, including Locarno, 
Bellinzona and Lugano, where the influence is heavily Italian. Scenes in Lugano 
show the market and outdoor cafes, health resorts and a park with famous sights 
of Switzerland built in miniature. 
</P>
<P>
Next, there's a brief visit to Andermatt and its health spa, Bad Ragaz, before 
reaching Chur, the oldest town in Switzerland, dating back to 3000 BC. 
</P>
<P>
The video concludes with scenes of the ski resorts at Arosa, Davos and St. 
Moritz, and a brief look at the elaborately decorated buildings of Appenzell. 
</P>
<P>
The film quality is very good and the narration informative. There are no tips 
or travel recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from International Video Network, Video Visits, 2242 Camino 
Ramon, San Ramon, Calif. 94583, (415) 866-1121. Price: $24.95.

TRIP OF THE WEEK: CIRCLING THE SHORE OF LAKE TAHOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MICHELE GRIMM and TOM GRIMM, The Grimms are Laguna Beach free-lance 
writers/photographers.

<DATELINE>
<P>
SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the place to begin one of the state's most spectacular drives -- 72 
miles around the largest alpine lake in North America. 
</P>
<P>
Snowcapped mountains, national forests and state parks ring Lake Tahoe, whose 
pristine waters are 6,225 feet above sea level. A two-lane highway circling the 
glistening blue lake offers panoramic views and historic sites. 
</P>
<P>
Spend a leisurely day on the route, which also leads to ski resorts and 
gambling casinos. Tahoe City, Crystal Bay, Incline Village and other 
settlements along the lake's north shore can provide food and drink. 
</P>
<P>
The road in summer is often bumper-to-bumper with sightseers, so winter is a 
good time to make the trip, although there are occasional delays after a 
snowfall until plows reopen the highway. 
</P>
<P>
The recents storms caused a temporary closure of a portion of California 89 
near Emerald Bay last week, but the snow and slush were quickly cleared. 
Motorists are advised, however, to check conditions with Caltrans when planning 
a trip. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason to tour now is that Caltrans will close the road for 
reconstruction near Emerald Bay from May 1 through June 15, except during the 
Memorial Day weekend May 25-29. From June 16 throughout summer the construction 
site will allow only alternating one-way traffic, with delays of 30 minutes or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Circle the lake in a clockwise direction, driving west from South Lake Tahoe on 
U.S. 50 to the Y junction with California 89 and bear right toward Tahoe City. 
The state highway winds through Eldorado National Forest to the Tallac Historic 
Site. 
</P>
<P>
Paths lead to rustic but impressive mansions of families who vacationed at the 
lake earlier in the century. Now under the care of the U.S. Forest Service, the 
buildings are open to tours and are the site of a festival of arts and music in 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
After the switchback road passes Cascade Lake, which fills a small volcanic 
crater, stop at Inspiration Point for a bird's-eye view of magnificent Emerald 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
On its tiny Fannette Island is a teahouse built in the 1920s by the owner of 
historic Vikingsholm, a 38-room castle at the edge of the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Farther up the road in Sugar Pine Point State Park is a turn-of-the-century 
estate, Erhman Mansion, which also is open to visitors in summer. Campers will 
find 175 sites ($10 a night) at the park's General Creek Campground, one of two 
year-round camps at the lake. The other is on the east shore at Zephyr Cove. 
</P>
<P>
The highway continues past Homewood Ski Bowl, one of more than a dozen downhill 
ski areas around Lake Tahoe. Ahead, at Tahoe Pines, are the fancy lakeside 
buildings of Fleur de Lac, once the estate of steel magnate and shipbuilder 
Henry J. Kaiser. 
</P>
<P>
At the north shore's largest town, Tahoe City, stop and park at Fanny Bridge 
that crosses the Truckee River, the only outlet from the lake. Lean over the 
railing to see enormous trout that live safely near the dam gates in a "no 
fishing" area. Take some bread to feed the trout and resident ducks. 
</P>
<P>
California 89 turns inland to two ski resorts, Alpine Meadows and Squaw Valley, 
site of the 1960 Winter Olympics. But bear right onto California 28 to continue 
around the lake. In the middle of the road is a Tahoe City landmark, a towering 
120-year-old tree that's decorated each Christmas. It's just opposite the 
area's oldest log cabin, built in 1880. 
</P>
<P>
In town along the highway are a variety of restaurants, including two local 
favorites, Emma Murphy's and Rosie's Cafe. Motels and vacation condominiums 
line the road in communities that stretch beyond to the California/Nevada 
border at Crystal Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Turn right to Cal-Nev Lodge, a resort hotel and casino that straddles the state 
line. Inside is the boundary, a white line that runs through the middle of a 
huge lodge fireplace. Opposite are artifacts and photographs tracing the 
history of Lake Tahoe's first inhabitants, the Washoe Indians. 
</P>
<P>
After driving past the other casinos at Crystal Bay, detour right on Lakeshore 
Boulevard to view lake-front homes at Incline Village. At Country Club Drive is 
the recently renovated Hyatt Lake Tahoe Resort and Casino. 
</P>
<P>
Turn left on that road and cross Tahoe Boulevard (Nevada 28) to reach Ski 
Incline. On the way is Spatz, a popular lakeview restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Continue east on Nevada 28, which passes Ponderosa Ranch, filming location for 
the "Bonanza" TV series. The highway hugs the lake shore at Lake Tahoe-Nevada 
State Park, where sunbathers flock to Sand Harbor and other beaches in warm 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
Then the road runs south through the pines and firs of Toiyabe National Forest 
before joining U.S. 50. 
</P>
<P>
That four-lane highway descends from Spooner Pass to follow the lake shore to 
Cave Rock, once a sacred Indian site through which a 200-foot tunnel was bored 
for road traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond is Zephyr Cove Resort with a well-known cafe and rustic cottages built 
in the early 1900s. It is the headquarters for snowmobile tours, and also home 
to the Dixie, a paddle-wheeler that plies the lake on sightseeing tours in 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
You'll pass a stop on the Pony Express trail called "Friday's Station," and the 
Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course that's a wintering spot for Canadian geese, before 
reaching the bright lights of Stateline, Nev. That border town holds Lake 
Tahoe's high-rise casino resort hotels -- Harrah's, Harvey's, Caesars and High 
Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
On the California side in neighboring South Lake Tahoe are dozens of additional 
lodgings but no gaming tables or slot machines. A list of accommodations and 
dining places are in a free travel planner that's available from the Lake Tahoe 
Visitors Authority. Call toll-free (800) 288-2463 or (800) 822-5922. 
</P>
<P>
Also ask for a copy of LATV's "Most Beautiful Drive in America" brochure that 
maps a trail around the lake. 
</P>
<P>
For a narrated tour with entertaining portrayals of the lake's history and 
attractions, buy an audiocassette called "Drive Around Lake Tahoe." It's 
available at gift shops in the Stateline casino hotels mentioned above and at 
the two Sierra bookshops in South Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
Copies also can be ordered by mail for $11.95 postpaid from Windchime 
Productions, P.O. Box 5401, South Lake Tahoe, Calif. 95729. 
</P>
<P>
To visit South Lake Tahoe from Los Angeles, drive north on Interstate 5 to 
Sacramento and take U.S. 50 east. Or travel along the eastern side of the 
Sierra Nevada on U.S. 395 and take U.S. 50 west. Round trip from Los Angeles to 
South Lake Tahoe is 976 miles. 
</P>
<P>
You also can tour by rental car after flying from the Los Angeles area to Lake 
Tahoe Airport or to nearby Reno-Cannon International Airport in Nevada.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: AIRLINE PASS INCREASES OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HUGHES, Hughes is a 30-year veteran travel writer living in Sherman 
Oaks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Continental Airlines has given its yearly pass for mature travelers age 62 or 
older a face lift -- a new name (from Golden Travel Passport to Freedom 
Passport), new features and options . . . and higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the cost of air travel, though, the pass is a great deal for 
seniors who plan to do a lot of traveling within a year. But the buying process 
is not unlike choosing a new car. 
</P>
<P>
You can buy the basic model for $1,599, which gives you a year's worth of 
flights within the United States to more than 80 cities. Or you can make it the 
deluxe model, which gives you the same amount of travel in first-class seats 
rather than coach. This option costs $1,999. 
</P>
<P>
Or you might go for the super-deluxe model called the Global Passport. It gives 
you all the domestic trips plus three round trips to Mexico, three more to the 
Caribbean, one round trip each to Hawaii, Central America and Europe (London or 
Paris) and still another to either Australia or New Zealand. All for $2,999. 
</P>
<P>
The ultra-super-deluxe model, the Global First Class Passport, has the same 
amount of domestic and international travel. It costs $4,999. 
</P>
<P>
You could choose just the basic $1,599 domestic passport and then select from 
several international trip options. These could be one to three trips to Mexico 
(choice of eight popular destinations) or the Caribbean (Aruba, Jamaica, St. 
Maarten or the Dominican Republic) for $150 per round trip, or one $150 round 
trip to either Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador or Belize. It's $250 for each 
first-class round trip to the same destinations. 
</P>
<P>
You could also select one round trip each to Hawaii (from $300; $450 
first-class) or London or Paris ($400; $800 first-class). 
</P>
<P>
All of the international options add up to $2,250 for coach travel. But because 
you can get all of the options included by buying the coach Global Passport for 
$2,999, buying them all separately as options doesn't make good sense. 
</P>
<P>
The same goes for first-class, where buying all options adds up to $3,900 for 
the 10 trips. But you can get them all as part of the $4,999 First Class Global 
Passport. 
</P>
<P>
At face value, taking all 10 trips with the Global Passport can save $850 in 
coach and $900 in first-class over the cost of buying the domestic passports 
plus all optional round trips. 
</P>
<P>
The Global Passports can be a terrific deal for those with the time, resources 
and stamina for that much travel in one year. But for others, it might be 
better to get the basic Domestic Passport and then buy the international 
options to suit individual travel plans. 
</P>
<P>
There are other restrictions to remember. You can only take one one-way trip a 
week, which must include a Saturday night stay-over between trips. And though 
you have a choice of more than 80 cities on Continental's routes, you cannot 
travel to any one city more than three times (not including your home city). 
</P>
<P>
There are also 33 blackout dates for domestic travel and more than 40 for 
international trips. Most are centered around major holiday periods. 
</P>
<P>
Travel must be between noon Monday and noon Thursday, plus all day Saturday. 
Further, there are only a limited number of these highly discounted passport 
seats available on each flight. 
</P>
<P>
So passport travelers should be flexible in formulating travel plans -- be 
prepared to travel during off-peak periods, and be ready at times to leave a 
day or two early or stay a day or two later. 
</P>
<P>
Continental also allows you to buy a companion passport. The companion can be 
of any age, but can only travel at the same time as the passport holder. 
</P>
<P>
There are additional benefits to passport holders -- discounts on car rentals 
and hotels, and deals on cruises or tours. And if you buy any of the domestic 
or global Freedom Passes and decide that they aren't for you, and you haven't 
traveled on any flight, you can get a full refund within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
It would be wise to also check with your travel agent about the other travel 
plans available for seniors. The 10% senior discounts, offered through the 
four- and eight-coupon books by Delta, United, Northwest and other carriers, 
might be a better option for those who don't figure to do a great deal of 
traveling within one year. 
</P>
<P>

441-1135.

Question: We've received Alaskan brochures indicating that Prince William Sound 
is again seeking tourists. Is the area free of oil? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: More than 2,000 miles of the sound's coastline was untouched, and the 
section affected by the Exxon spill is slowly being cleaned. Local officials 
say that the sound is still one of Alaska's major visitor attractions. For 
details, write to Prince William Sound Tourism Coalition, P.O. Box 1477, 
Valdez, Alaska 99686. 
</P>
<P>
Q: As rail buffs, we'd like to ride the fastest European trains. Which are they 
and how do they compare with the speed of the Japanese bullet trains? 
</P>
<P>
A: The French TGV still is the fastest, linking Paris/Lyon at a maximum 186 
m.p.h. German Intercity Express will reach 165 m.p.h. next year between Munich 
and Hamburg, while British Rail's high is 125 m.p.h. Top speed of the Japan 
bullet trains is 170 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How does the new Historic Hotels of America organization select its members, 
and are there any in California? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The hotels must be at least 50 years old, and listed or be eligible for the 
National Register of Historic Places. Among the first 32 chosen are the La 
Valencia Hotel in La Jolla (1132 Prospect, La Jolla 92037, 619-454-0771) and 
two in San Francisco -- the Westin St. Francis (335 Powell St., San Francisco 
94102, 415-397-7000) and El Drisco (2901 Pacific Ave., San Francisco 94115, 
415-346-2880). For a complete list, write the organization at 1785 
Massachusetts Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. 
</P>
<P>
Q: A hotel recently charged $10 a page for FAX usage. Is this a normal cost? 
</P>
<P>
A: As hotels can charge whatever they want for telephone, FAX and other message 
services, it's best to ask before using them. Public FAX services are 
proliferating and may cost considerably less. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there a chain of French country inns that guarantee against noise? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Relaise du Silence cater to guests who prefer solitude to the bustle of 
larger hotels, and allow for back roads exploration. A directory of more than 
100 of these establishments is available for $2 by writing to 38640 Claix, 
Isere, France. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do Hong Kong tailors still make suits in one day? 
</P>
<P>
A: Some will, but many of the better tailors suggest three fittings and 
three-day delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What's the best way to find out which hotels and motels accept dogs? 
</P>
<P>
A: A directory, "Traveling With Towser," listing thousands of hotels that 
accept dogs, is available for $1.50 from Quacker Professional Services, Dept. 
GPR, 585 Hawthorne Court, Galesburg, Ill. 61401. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are there package tours for recovering alcoholics and drug users? 
</P>
<P>
A: Nearly a dozen companies operate such trips to domestic, Caribbean and other 
destinations. Most offer outdoor recreation, counselors and seminars as part of 
the therapy programs. Among the companies is Sober Vacations International, 
2365 Westwood Blvd., Suite 21, Los Angeles 90064, (213) 470-0606.

NICARAGUA VOTES TODAY, U.S. AGONIZES TOMORROW; 
</P>
<P>
POLICY: WASHINGTON IS IN TROUBLE NO MATTER WHO WINS THE NICARAGUA PRESIDENCY. 
ENDING A HISTORY OF U.S. INTERVENTION IS THE BEST POSSIBLE RESULT.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A deeply divided Bush Administration awaits the outcome of today's elections in 
Nicaragua: What to do if the despised Sandinistas win and remain in power? What 
to do if they lose? 
</P>
<P>
Either result poses profound problems. The White House fervently roots for the 
victory of Violeta Chamorro, the opposition leader; her campaign has enjoyed 
U.S. money and advice. The White House roots against President Daniel Ortega, a 
self-acknowledged Marxist and a supporter of Central American leftist guerrilla 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
But a Chamorro triumph would not solve Nicaragua's aching troubles -- nor would 
it assure a victory for U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of that small, long-tortured little republic is once again at stake. 
But so is the regional prestige and influence of the United States, after 
nearly a decade of futile overt and covert hostilities against the Sandinista 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
If Ortega is reelected -- he won handily in 1984, when no credible opposition 
candidate stayed in the race -- the Bush team will have to stomach a sour 
reality: The democracy that Washington preached for Nicaragua worked for the 
Sandinistas and not for Chamorro. This would be the ultimate, most ironic, 
defeat of U.S. policy in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Not since the elections in Chile 20 years ago, when Salvador Allende, a 
Marxist, was chosen president despite all-out U.S. support for his adversaries, 
has a Latin American election contest so embroiled the United States. And the 
postscript to the Chile episode -- U.S. attempts to destabilize the new 
government, a military revolution that overthrew Allende and Allende's death 
three years after his election -- brought new problems to Latin America and no 
credit to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Today's Nicaragua elections follow a U.S. invasion of Panama by two months, the 
military intervention designed to oust Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. Noriega had 
become an obsession for Washington, indicted for his alleged drug-dealing and 
despised for his ability to resist U.S. pressure. The obsession with Ortega is 
milder but also based on frustration, on a U.S. inability to influence 
Nicaragua politics despite overt and covert action. 
</P>
<P>
The Panama invasion may have played right into Sandinista hands. It rearoused 
nationalism. Nicaraguans remember that U.S. Marines intervened in their country 
several times between 1909 and 1933. Many believe the Contra "freedom fighters" 
are a product of U.S. design. Some voters may opt for Ortega solely on grounds 
of resisting Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration must weigh two possible scenarios: 
</P>
<P>
Ortega Wins. With more than 1,000 observers on hand to watch over the 
proceedings (from the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the 
European Community and a delegation led by former President Jimmy Carter), 
Ortega is extremely unlikely to attempt electoral fraud or intimidation. If the 
foreign observers certify the validity of his reelection, Washington will have 
no choice -- in terms of world opinion -- but to recognize Sandinista 
legitimacy. Failure to do so would create an untenable situation for the United 
States, in vivid contrast to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's posture of allowing nations 
in the Soviet orbit to work out their own destinies. 
</P>
<P>
The more relevant issue is how far and how rapidly the United States is 
prepared to move in normalizing relations with Nicaragua. This is the nub of 
dispute within the Administration: White House hard-liners believe that even 
after an Ortega victory, conditions must be attached to any relaxation of 
American pressures on Managua. The State Department seems ready to move faster, 
on everything from the lifting of the economic embargo to the disbanding and 
relocation of about 12,000 Contras, as provided for in the Central American 
accords that led to election day. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, however, said as recently as Thursday 
that the United States will make its own judgment about election fairness and 
that better relations with Managua depend on "a sustained period of good 
behavior in terms of refraining from subverting their neighbors." This kind of 
insistence may imply a higher standard demanded of Nicaragua than of other 
nations -- and could produce new policy disasters. 
</P>
<P>
Disbanding and resettling the Contras -- inside or outside Nicaragua -- is an 
urgent priority. If the Administration does not act rapidly, a new crisis is 
bound to develop. Inside Nicaragua, about 3,000 Contras are still fighting a 
guerrilla war. The larger Contra force is in neighboring Honduras, along with 
wives and children. Thousands of armed men with no place to go and no organized 
objective are a peril to the stability of both countries. Congressional funding 
for humanitarian aid to the Contras runs out at the end of this month; no new 
money is likely to be approved other than for relocation. 
</P>
<P>
The demand that the Sandinistas end military assistance to the leftist 
guerrillas in El Salvador is reasonable. Ortega may do that in return for 
removal of U.S. economic sanctions. Nicaragua is about broke, shattered by war 
and by economic mismanagement. The accords signed by Ortega and the four other 
Central American presidents provided for cessation of armed help to guerrillas 
anywhere in the region. But the Sandinistas reportedly violated that agreement 
in attempting to deliver surface-to-air missiles to their Salvadoran guerrilla 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
At home, Ortega has released 1,200 political prisoners two weeks before the 
election. He has largely restored freedom of expression in the media. Both 
actions were self-serving and good for the campaign. But they also helped heal 
the country. The United States extends considerable generosity to regimes 
practicing more repression than does Managua. If the Bush Administration acts 
with imagination -- and if Ortega does not respond with ideological tantrums -- 
Nicaragua may turn into a success story: another example of a nation enjoying 
peaceful transition from leftist dictatorship to representative democracy, the 
New World version of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro Wins. Washington will rush to embrace her victory but mammoth troubles 
lie ahead. Chamorro is the standard-bearer for more than one dozen political 
parties forming the Nicaraguan opposition movement. Representing so many 
interests, many conflicting, there is no certainty that she will be able to 
hammer together an effective government, even with massive U.S. aid. The battle 
for power may erupt all over again under different banners. 
</P>
<P>
Uncertainty will be exacerbated by reality: Sandinistas will retain control of 
the armed forces and the police, plus many elements of the bureaucracy. To 
attempt to replace the Sandinista army with Contra forces appears unthinkable; 
that would trigger a new, bigger, deadlier civil war. 
</P>
<P>
If the levers of effective power are not in Chamorro's hands, she may find 
herself facing day-to-day Sandinista challenges in matters of governance. And 
she will have few forces mobilized to assert authority. Washington could be 
tempted to provide help, overt or covert, but this would reopen the old sores 
among Nicaraguans. The U.S. Administration may have to decide whether 
full-fledged economic assistance should be offered to Managua if indeed nobody 
is really in charge and political battles continue. 
</P>
<P>
The election may be Act II. The drama is certain to persist no matter who wins. 
</P>
<P>
Real resolution will only come when Nicaraguans determine their own future, 
when the United States has at last forsworn intervention in their lives. The 
best way out of the morass is for the United States to accept the result of the 
balloting -- and to display some old-fashioned American generosity toward the 
impoverished and war-weary people of a republic that has obsessed us for so 
long. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was also a victim of obsession: The trials of the Iran-Contra 
scandal are still with us. Former President Reagan and President Bush still 
face possible embarrassment from the illegal arming of Contra guerrillas. 
Nicaragua is a shadowy chapter of American history in need of new light.

A MOSCOW DEBATE OVER 'EXORBITANT' MILITARY COSTS; 
</P>
<P>
GLASNOST: A SOVIET EXPERT ON AMERICA ACCUSES HIS COUNTRY'S MILITARY LEADERS OF 
DISTORTING U.S. DEFENSE SPENDING TO MAINTAIN A 'HUGE WAR MACHINE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Georgi Arbatov, Georgi Arbatov, director of the Institute of U.S. and 
Canadian Studies, a branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, is a member of 
the Soviet Parliament. This article, adapted from the magazine Ogonyok, was

<TEXT>
<P>
At the Second Congress of People's Deputies in December, I criticized the 
Soviet Union's exorbitant military expenditures for the following reasons: 
</P>
<P>
New political thinking, a major element of perestroika and a new concept of 
foreign policy. It also implies a new attitude to military force, its role and 
the possibility of using it. 
</P>
<P>
I am not saying that previously we advocated the use of force in politics or 
war. Socialism is against war and it is no accident that the first Soviet 
decree was the decree on peace. But, as was often the case in many other 
spheres, we did not always live up to our lofty principles and ideals in this 
area. 
</P>
<P>
While generally rejecting the "export of revolution," we nevertheless not 
infrequently resorted to bellicose revolutionary rhetoric. Too often we pursued 
a policy that was prompted by our imperial ambitions. There is no need to prove 
this now that we have condemned Stalin's secret agreements with Hitler in 1939, 
the use of the armed forces by the Soviet Union and its allies in 
Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the decision to bring in troops to Afghanistan in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
But a review of political attitudes and concepts leads (and has already led) to 
a reduction of the risk of war and a rethinking of military doctrines and 
strategy. The new policy does not require such large armed forces and, 
consequently, such large military expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Surplus military might is no "safety factor." It is bad for the new policy, 
because the other side judges your intentions not so much by what you say as by 
your military capabilities. Military capabilities should be "reasonably 
sufficient," no more and no less. This means that one should have just enough 
to defend oneself and not to provoke the other side (especially considering 
that the United States has not abandoned its old political thinking and 
"gunboat diplomacy.") 
</P>
<P>
Yet one should have not enough to attack and defeat the other side, not enough 
to make the other side afraid or tempt one's own politicians into reckless 
action. We have proclaimed such a political and military concept and must now 
change our armed forces and defense spending accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
Our difficult economic state. When you are in debt and have no money to buy the 
most essential things, you should do what every housewife would do: live within 
your means, save on everything and give up all unnecessary expenses. 
</P>
<P>
I think a state should behave in the same manner. It must, first of all, give 
up all luxuries and extravagances, such as big capital investments that do not 
pay off quickly, the maintenance of an enormous bureaucratic apparatus, the 
production of shoddy goods which no one wants to buy and excessive military 
expenditures. I am convinced that our military spending today exceeds the 
requirements of security and reasonable sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Overmilitarization. Many aspects of our life -- the economy, science and even 
education -- are too militarized for a socialist society. It is, to a great 
extent, a natural consequence of Stalinism, of which militarism was always a 
part (in fact, the entire administrative-command system is a vestige of 
military communism). At the same time, it is the result of policy pursued in 
the post-Stalinist period when marshals, generals and arms manufacturers 
received so much freedom they became practically uncontrollable. 
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of "great commanders" such as Leonid I. Brezhnev, (former 
Defense Minister) Dimitri F. Ustinov and (former Defense Minister) Andrei 
Grechko, who shamelessly received top military honors and ranks in peacetime, 
they created a huge and fabulously expensive war machine (which has repetedly 
surprised us by its ineffectiveness in recent years). 
</P>
<P>
What did we gain from creating that giant? First of all, in the '70s, in spite 
of the policy of detente, we succeeded in scaring the entire world and forging 
against us a coalition of all leading powers, the most powerful since Napoleon. 
(The amazing fact we have just learned from our official press is that the 
Soviet Union has almost 64,000 tanks -- more than all the other countries of 
the world put together). 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, we bled white and destabilized our economy and finances, which 
inevitably led to social tension and a lowering of living standards. The gap 
between the Soviet Union and the industrialized Western nations began to widen. 
Lastly, while condemning American imperialism, we helped the U.S. 
military-industrial complex to prolong the Cold War for 15 years or more and 
suspend the budding process of disarmament and demilitarization of 
international relations. 
</P>
<P>
All these facts show that we should begin an open and honest discussion of the 
problems of the armed forces, military policy and defense spending as soon as 
possible. A radical reform in this sphere should become a key element of the 
policy of perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that some Soviet army commanders are doing everything to avert 
such a discussion. They resort to dishonest methods, such as concealing or 
distorting information, discrediting their critics and attaching political 
labels to them. Unable to deny the existence of problems and shortcomings in 
the military sphere, they are trying to ward off all criticism. 
</P>
<P>
This campaign, conducted with a lot of clamor, arrogance and even 
aggressiveness, does not meet the interests of the country and the armed 
forces. That is why I considered it extremely important that the discussion of 
military affairs be transferred to Parliament. The more so since the Supreme 
Soviet Committee on Defense and State Security is not justifying the hopes 
pinned on it -- it is largely composed of representatives of the leadership of 
the Defense Ministry and defense industry and has virtually become their lobby 
rather than a body of parliamentary control. 
</P>
<P>
When I took the floor at the Congress, I certainly realized that my proposals 
for a more drastic reduction in defense spending would be violently attacked by 
representatives of the military leadership. That is why the statements made by 
Adm. Vladimir N. Chernavin (commander in chief of the Soviet Navy) and Lt. Gen. 
Alexander I. Ovchinnikov (a member of the Military Council) did not surprise 
me. Yet enthusiastic support for my statement and proposals by officers and 
several generals at the Congress and elsewhere came as a pleasant surprise. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to answer briefly one of my critics, Gen. Ovchinnikov. I cannot 
ignore the attempts to controvert my assertion that in recent years the United 
States has been reducing its military allocations, and that the Soviet armed 
forces exceed by far those of America in troop strength. It is not that my 
"oratorical vanity" was hurt -- the aims of Gen. Ovchinnikov were so 
transparent. Taking issue with me, he claimed that the United States continued 
to increase its military expenditures, and that its troops (he included troops 
of U.S. allies in his count) outnumbered Soviet troops. His message was clear, 
questioning the Soviet policy of reducing troops and defense expenditures. That 
is why I have a duty to cite some facts. 
</P>
<P>
Is it true, as Gen. Ovchinnikov claims, that in recent years American military 
allocations have been growing? No, not true. 
</P>
<P>
What I know and want to repeat here is that since 1985, U.S. military 
allocations have been steadily declining (though I think the United States, 
just as the Soviet Union, should have reduced its military allocations faster). 
Here are official U.S. figures, making adjustments for inflation by using 1989 
constant prices: $325.5 billion in 1985, $311.9 billion in 1986, $301.8 billion 
in 1987, $292.8 billion in 1988 and $290.8 billion in 1989 -- that is $35 
billion, or more than 10%, less than five years ago. It is too early to speak 
about 1990, because there is no accurate figure for inflation yet. 
</P>
<P>
The same is true of my statement that even when we reduce our armed forces by 
500,000 men, our forces will still outnumber U.S. forces by 1.5 million. Gen. 
Ovchinnikov said that they would outnumber the American forces by a "mere" 
460,000. 
</P>
<P>
The readers of Ogonyok already know about the origin of this discrepancy from 
an "open letter" to the magazine's editor from Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, 
and the editor's commentary to that letter. Marshal Akhromeyev added to the 2.1 
million American servicemen the National Guard and reservists, although he 
excluded from his count of the Soviet armed forces not only reservists, but 
also the border and interior forces. 
</P>
<P>
The Ogonyok commentary pointed to the tactlessness of this discrepancy, so I 
have only one thing to add to it: If Marshal Akhromeyev considers it right to 
equate the American reservists and National Guard, which is a territorial 
militia, with our regular army, what prevents us from adopting the same system? 
It would be cheaper for the country and more useful for the economy. The 
population would welcome such a system, especially people of call-up age (it's 
nice to stay at home and spend one to 40 days a year in encampments, which will 
count as your military service). 
</P>
<P>
This is how the matters really stand. Besides, it is not the United States but 
the Soviet Union that has adopted the doctrine of "reasonable sufficiency," 
which makes us think seriously about many things, especially in our difficult 
economic situation. Specifically, we should think about what threatens us more 
-- foreign intervention or our growing economic difficulties? If this trend 
continues, it can eventually make us a developing country. 
</P>
<P>
We should also think more about such specific things as why we still have the 
largest army in the world and spend on military purposes a bigger share of our 
gross national product than any other major power (even if we assume that our 
official military budget figures are 100% correct). We should also think why we 
produce more weapons of almost all types than any other country and are the 
world's largest arms-trader. 
</P>
<P>
The most important thing we should think about is who should govern the armed 
forces in this country and, on the basis of what laws, who should decide how 
our armed forces should be organized, who should allocate funds to them and who 
should oversee the spending of these funds. I think all these questions, as 
well as the question of the composition and functions of the appropriate 
Supreme Soviet committee, should be put on the agenda of our Parliament as soon 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The Second Congress of People's Deputies began the discussion of military 
affairs, but I believe that this discussion should be continued in the Supreme 
Soviet and eventually lead to the adoption of laws and political and budget 
decisions. This would meet the interests of the armed forces, the interests of 
the nation and its economy and defense capability. 
</P>
<P>
Policy is formulated by political leadership in accordance with the 
constitution and law. Military strategy and doctrine should serve the aims of 
policy. And the quantity, quality and structure of the armed forces, defense 
expenditures and armaments programs should serve the aims of policy, strategy 
and doctrine -- not vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
A group of army officers, members of Parliament, distributed a very interesting 
document at the Congress. Entitled "Military Reform Concept," it showed that a 
consensus on such crucial issues is possible between the military and 
civilians. So the discussion has begun and has already produced some results.

GRASS ROOTS ARE NO PLACE FOR GROWTH CONTROL; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: BAD AIR, GROWTH AND GRIDLOCK DO NOT YIELD TO SINGLE-ISSUE 
AGENCIES. CALIFORNIA NEEDS REGIONAL MANAGEMENT AUTHORITIES.

Los Angelization, they call it. The term requires no explanation; in urban 
regions nationwide, the specter of Los Angeles is raised to galvanize 
aggressive growth management. "We love to ridicule L.A.," said John Eells, 
transportation planning coordinator for Marin County, "but metropolitan America 
is imitating L.A. in every respect." 
</P>
<P>
Eells refers to the increasing suburbanization of home and workplace, the 
multiple crises caused by failure to manage growth. Dozens of dedicated 
agencies paddle furiously against the currents of air pollution, traffic 
congestion and energy consumption. These issues, usually handled by separate 
agencies, in fact demand coordinated management; they are inseparable from one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District has already recognized that it 
cannot achieve its goals without addressing both transportation and growth 
management issues. Hence its plan relies on Southern California Assn. of 
Governments' Growth Management and Transportation Task Force to propose a 
regional plan, released in an interim report last month. 
</P>
<P>
If Proposition 111 passes on the June ballot, AB 471, linking transit planning 
to land-use planning, will become law. AB 471 requires that counties and larger 
cities, as a condition for state funds, submit local growth-management plans 
consistent with regional goals. More, in January the Assembly Office of 
Research recommended that growth issues be managed on a regional level. 
</P>
<P>
Good growth management does not yield to simple pro-growth/no-growth debate. No 
plan can stop people from being born and living longer, nor can it reduce the 
collective appetite for economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Yet growth itself has prevented single-issue agencies from success. Proposed 
mass-transit systems, for example, are key elements in plans to reduce traffic 
congestion, energy consumption and air pollution. Given a suburb-to-city 
commute pattern, mass transit systems are utilized: 50% of the commuters to San 
Francisco use mass transit; 400,000 jobs are located within walking distance of 
three BART stations, along with stores, restaurants and services. 
</P>
<P>
But two-thirds of suburban commuters travel from suburb to suburb, often to 
work at a sprawling, landscaped industrial complex where the only people on 
foot don running shoes for a daily workout. The complex may be miles from the 
nearest restaurant, store, dentist, cleaners or residence. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys show that the people who shun mass transit want to do shopping and 
errands at lunch or en route to work. And those workers travel ever-increasing 
distances as they move farther from the city core to find affordable housing in 
uncongested areas. 
</P>
<P>
Two thirds of all jobs created between 1960 and 1980 were created in the 
suburbs. The trend has since accelerated. Attracted by cheaper land, among 
other factors, business has moved to the previously undeveloped countryside, 
followed by residential developments and sometimes shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
Suburban centers blossom like skin rashes, created by uncoordinated decisions 
among developers, industry and planners. 
</P>
<P>
The aggregate regional impact of such unrelated decisions is not forecast as 
each development is approved. Most centers exacerbate traffic and air-quality 
problems for a number of reasons. Nearby housing is not affordable for the 
majority of workers employed in the offices and malls. They must, in turn, 
commute from less expensive residential areas. Some suburban areas lack the 
critical mass of employment and residents to support services -- shops, 
restaurants and medical centers. Others may have more density than existing 
roadways can bear, but not enough to support mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
The Growth Management and Transportation Task Force report states that reducing 
vehicle-miles traveled "through job/housing balance should be the major focus 
of growth management measures." 
</P>
<P>
The December, 1989, report by the California Assembly Office of Research, 
"Getting Ahead of the Growth Curve," questions growth management by agencies 
that depend on the cooperation of numerous local governments and single-issue 
agencies. A January news release states that "existing regional agencies lack 
the authority, are too narrowly focused on single issues and are too often 
captured by the interests of their local government members who sit as their 
directors." 
</P>
<P>
The report recommends that California growth and related issues be linked and 
managed on a regional level: "The consequences of unmanaged growth have become 
increasingly regional -- extending beyond city and county boundaries -- but the 
fiscal and organizational resources to address those problems have remained 
under local control." No local government, acting independently, has the 
authority or money to solve growth problems. 
</P>
<P>
Eells believes that local pressure prohibits local elected officials from 
putting regional goals ahead of local interests: "Ever since Proposition 13, 
the primary fund-raising focus of local government has become the pursuit of 
revenue-producing commercial and office development." Elected officials, he 
claims, adopt this strategy "to be responsive to constituents who do not want 
services cut or taxes raised." 
</P>
<P>
"No local official," Eells continued, "will stay in office by supporting 
high-density affordable housing. We have suburban sprawl because people want 
it. Suburban sprawl is the cumulative effect of incremental decisions on 
low-density development." 
</P>
<P>
If growth-spawned problems are to be reduced or even held at present levels, 
management must come from an agency with authority that transcends political 
boundaries and single issues. 
</P>
<P>
Its strategies must: 
</P>
<P>
Provide incentives for developers and industry to locate low-salaried job 
growth near existing affordable housing and in declining, underutilized 
inner-city areas served by mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
Link transportation and land-use planning. Redirect low-density office and 
commercial development to high-density development along mass transit routes 
and high-capacity arterials. Encourage development of high-density affordable 
housing in close proximity. 
</P>
<P>
Eliminate sprawling, isolated auto-dependent industrial complexes. As a 
condition of commercial development, require high-density affordable housing in 
close proximity, with facilities for a range of service establishments and 
child-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
Distribute responsibility for providing services and mitigating environmental 
impact, rather than targeting a specific group such as developers. 
</P>
<P>
In previously undeveloped countryside, encourage any new development to take 
the form of planned, self-sufficient communities with a mix of office and 
commercial development, and a nearby range of homes and rental units to 
accommodate both affluent and low-income workers. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Porter Ranch project in the San Fernando Valley incorporates some 
of those features. Mayor Tom Bradley requested that a percentage of residential 
units be designated for low- to moderate-income residents and senior citizens. 
By providing for density in advance, planners can avoid residents' objections 
to increasing density in a previously low-density neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Any regional agency will need citizen support. The common denominator of growth 
problems -- cause and cure -- is people. We all want what we want, and what we 
want is everything -- money, cars, clean air, low density, low taxes and high 
levels of services. No one can outrun environmental problems by leapfrogging 
out to the countryside. The problems follow them out, along the way engulfing 
all the communities in their path.

<TEXT>
<P>
I'm going to stick my neck out as I did in my early days as a chief of police 
during the 1970s. Addressing the Los Angeles Breakfast Club, I made a statement 
that children need the mother at home during the first six or seven years of a 
child's life. Nothing else -- no one else -- can do the job of civilizing an 
infant into a thinking child, a human being with a feeling of compassion for 
others. 
</P>
<P>
As we begin the 1990s, I still believe that. One of our most serious social 
problems is juvenile crime and juvenile crime matures into adult crime. 
</P>
<P>
The Delinquency Control Institute of USC taught me that all studies make clear 
the problem: Children from broken homes, children without parents to guide 
their destiny, tend more toward criminality than children who have at least one 
parent present in their early years. 
</P>
<P>
I'm convinced that more than half the approximately 100,000 inmates locked up 
by the state of California -- not even counting those locked up in local county 
facilities -- are people who never developed a feeling of responsibility for 
their conduct, for the way their behavior affected fellow human beings. Many 
gang killings are performed by people who don't have a conscience. 
</P>
<P>
We used to call such people psychopathic personalities; now we call them 
sociopaths. By whatever name, they failed to develop consciences during their 
first seven years. If a conscience isn't developed in childhood, it won't be 
developed later. Fact. 
</P>
<P>
The rearing of children during preschool years is the most important foundation 
for the advancement of a more civilized, safer, society. 
</P>
<P>
When I criticized mothers for not being home to raise their children, there was 
a huge outcry -- mainly from the liberal community -- denouncing my comment. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two decades -- and violent crime increases -- later, I have not changed 
my thinking. As a civilization we have to consider the kinds of legislative 
action that will reward a family where one parent, preferably the mother, stays 
home during the years before a child enters regular schooling, nurturing that 
child with all the cultural values and understanding that mother -- or father 
-- commands. 
</P>
<P>
Parenthood is thrust on too many people too soon, at an age before the new 
parent has thought through this exceptionally important new role. Parenthood is 
thrust on people before many of them really understand the importance of 
discipline, the necessity of love, affection and security so necessary to 
developing a child as a caring, thinking human being. 
</P>
<P>
A bill I wrote was passed by the Legislature in 1984 but vetoed by the 
governor; it was a modest attempt to have each school district develop a 
program of parental training for high school students. Those are the young 
people who, in a short period of time, are going to be mothers or fathers. 
There is much to teach young people who are going to be parents. 
</P>
<P>
I still believe that legislation providing parent-education in high school is 
one element to help children and adults lead better lives. 
</P>
<P>
I would now go further and propose that both federal and state governments 
consider taking some funds, especially if we become a more peaceful world, to 
provide funding for a family where one parent stays at home to raise the 
children, thereby allowing us to become a more peaceful community. The funding 
would be in the form of federal and state grants, to encourage one parent to 
stay home during the early years of a child's life. In today's society, most 
mothers decide -- from need or desire -- to work and farm their infants out. 
</P>
<P>
I understand the economic motivations for two-income families. There are so 
many wants: bigger home, nicer possessions and -- in some cases -- just a 
determined desire to at last make financial ends meet. Yet when you look at the 
cost to the family, and society, of having a mother go offto work when there 
are still babies in the household, the net profit is often illusory. 
</P>
<P>
Having a mother on the job, outside the home, increases family expenses. One 
additional car, or bus fare. A larger clothing bill. Meals outside the home. 
And perhaps additional medical bills. Legislation cannot match the income a 
parent could earn if that parent went to work, but government can provide a 
portion of compensatory income, to make staying at home a benefit for the 
family and the community. Such a program would not have earnings or wealth 
tests as connected conditions. It would apply equally, regardless of current 
income. 
</P>
<P>
Children produced by families of different economic levels have exactly the 
same needs from adults: love, discipline, morals and ethics taught in the home. 
Once that training is complete, then a child is prepared for adulthood, for the 
serious consideration of how personal behavior impacts other human beings. I 
believe parental presence would do wonders in reducing the number of criminals 
we produce in our society. 
</P>
<P>
My proposal is not connected to -- nor would it replace -- the present Aid to 
Families With Dependent Children program. I have always supported, without 
reservation, the California AFDC program, probably the most generous in the 
nation. Yet it does not provide luxury by any means, only a certain amount of 
subsistence, perhaps the minimum a civilized society should offer for those 
people less fortunate.

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Bush and congressional farm policy leaders have carved out separate 
farm policy platforms, and both are bad news for the American public. In the 
coming months, Congress will complete a program for the next five years of 
federal farm aid that is likely to cost taxpayers and consumers $125 billion -- 
more than $2,000 per American family. Unfortunately, neither Bush nor Congress 
appears to have learned anything from previous failures. 
</P>
<P>
Farm subsidies -- roughly $20 billion a year in federal dollars, $10 billion 
more in higher food prices -- are the equivalent of giving every full-time 
subsidized farmer a new Mercedes-Benz every year. The annual subsidy for each 
dairy cow in the United States exceeds the per capita income of half the 
world's population. With the $260 billion that taxpayers and consumers spent 
subsidizing farmers in the 1980s, Uncle Sam could have bought every farm, barn 
and tractor in 33 states. 
</P>
<P>
But this is only a small part of the farm scam. 
</P>
<P>
The average full-time farmer (gross annual sales greater than $100,000) is a 
millionaire. In 1987, he or she enjoyed an income of more than $130,000. 
Typically, that farmer can receive more handouts in a year than a needy family 
can get in food stamps in a lifetime. In 1986, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture gave more than 150 times as much to each of these largest farmers 
as it gave to each of the smallest farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Farm policy is a bizarre tangle of contradictions. The USDA gives billions of 
dollars to farmers to encourage them to grow more wheat and corn than they 
otherwise would. The result: perpetual surpluses. Faced with these surpluses, 
the department also spends billions to encourage farmers not to work. In 1988, 
farmers were rewarded for not planting the equivalent of Indiana and Ohio. 
According to a USDA study, the 78-million-acre shutdown reduced farm and 
farm-related employment by an estimated 300,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Farm programs are our most ineffective welfare programs. The sugar program 
costs consumers $10 for every dollar of income realized by America's 11,000 
sugar producers. A Purdue University study found that the price tag for each 
farmer saved could be as high as $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
In California, farmers are heavily penalized by federal marketing orders. These 
restrict the percentage of a farmer's harvest that can be sold. This year, the 
orders will force farmers to abandon or squander hundreds of millions of lemons 
and oranges, 100 million pounds of raisins and millions of plums and 
nectarines. In rationalizing this waste, the USDA says it must protect fruit 
growers from the forces of the free market. Unfortunately, there is no one to 
protect farmers from the USDA. 
</P>
<P>
Farm-credit subsidies have destabilized American agriculture. The Farmers Home 
Administration begged incompetent farmers to borrow more and more. The General 
Accounting Office found that 25% of the bankrupt FHA borrowers were ruined, in 
large part, by taking too many of these loans. Furthermore, farm-credit 
programs have inflated land values and rental rates, thereby increasing all 
farmers' cost of production and decreasing American competitiveness on world 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
Farm programs have devastated the productivity of American farmers. The more 
welfare farmers have received, the less competitive they have become. Every 
crop on which the USDA has lavished benefits has ended up with either strict 
controls or huge excess capacity. Paying farmers to idle some of their land has 
sharply increased their real cost of production per bushel and decreased 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
Farm subsidies have been an environmental disaster. In order to qualify for 
subsidies, a grain farmer is effectively prohibited from adopting normal crop 
rotation methods. As a result, the land loses its productivity and the farmer 
must blanket it with chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Generous subsidies 
also have encouraged farmers to plow up millions of fragile acres that would 
not otherwise have been sodbusted. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of farm products produced in America are not federally 
subsidized. Dairy, corn and wheat producers receive billions in federal 
benefits each year; cattlemen, soybean and potato producers get few or no 
handouts. There is no fundamental difference between the subsidized and 
unsubsidized farm products -- only a difference in the political clout of their 
commodity lobbies. If most farm products can be produced profitably for market, 
there is no reason why any farm product should be subsidized. 
</P>
<P>
Riding a tractor should not automatically entitle a person to other people's 
paychecks. The surest way to end the "farm problem" is to abolish our maze of 
self-defeating farm programs.

SHUT OUT BY HISTORICAL AMNESIA;

<P>
LATINOS: DENIED THEIR PAST, THESE ORIGINAL CALIFORNIANS HAVE BECOME OUR 
POLITICAL UNDERCLASS.

Suffering from historical amnesia, many Angelenos continue to view Latinos as 
foreigners. I have heard people question the current Latino suit against the 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors: why should "Mexicans" have 
representation on the board? Whites and blacks both seem to think that civil 
rights is not a Latino issue. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Californians must know that this area once belonged to Mexico. What 
they apparently don't know is the history that draws a continuous link between 
what happened after the United States took all of the Southwest from Mexico and 
today's shutout of Latino Americans from the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Our schools regularly teach about the social injustices suffered by blacks in 
the South and by European immigrants in the Eastern cities. Few history courses 
mention unjust laws directed against Latinos, such as the infamous "Greaser 
Act," a California anti-vagrancy law. El Clamor Publico, a newspaper published 
here in the 1850s, is full of accounts of lynchings and racial injustices 
toward Mexicans, but it is seldom seen in any course of study, nor is editor 
Francisco Ramirez's call for a "Back to Mexico" movement. 
</P>
<P>
The flood of Easterners, brought by the railroads in the 1880s, seems to have 
swept away all evidence of the Latino past. This is distressing. Los Angeles 
was built by the labor of Mexicans who had to live segregated in enclaves, 
attending separate schools and even separate churches. From the beginning, they 
formed self-help groups, labor associations and libraries in an effort to 
change this inequality. They gathered in the old plaza at Olvera Street, 
organizing against injustices in Mexico and Los Angeles. They held this 
political space in the face of incessant police sweeps, eventually forcing 
local authorities to designate free-speech areas in the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Lost in L.A.'s history is the forced repatriation of more than 75,000 Mexicans, 
a majority of them U.S.-born children, during the Great Depression. Or the fact 
that lawful school segregation was ended in California in a 1946 suit (Mendez 
vs. Westminster School District) filed by Mexicans in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Luis Valdez's play, some Angelenos know about the Sleepy Lagoon 
murder case (1942) and the zoot-suit riots (1943). Fewer are familiar with 
Latino contributions during the war years: Ysmael R. Villegas of the Casablanca 
colonia of Riverside and David Gonzales of Pacoima were posthumously awarded 
the Medal of Honor. Guy Lou Gabaldon, raised on the Eastside, single-handedly 
captured over 1,000 Japanese soldiers on Saipan. In the Korean War, the medal 
was awarded to Eugene A. Obregon of Los Angeles (posthumously) and Joseph C. 
Rodriguez of San Bernardino. In all, 17 Mexican Americans received this highest 
military honor for valor during those wars while thousands more gave their 
lives in defense of a country that saw them as foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
In pursuit of empowerment, in 1949 Mexican Americans elected Edward R. Roybal 
to the Los Angeles City Council. Roybal's civil-rights record has no equal in 
the city's history, where he led the fight for fair employment and against 
urban renewal and police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to Roybal after that demonstrates the mistakes that can be made 
when a city ignores its history. Democratic Party leaders lost a golden 
opportunity to forge a liberal black and Latino political coalition when they 
abandoned Roybal in his 1958 supervisorial race, in which he was the victim of 
widespread voter intimidation and fraud. When Roybal was elected to Congress in 
1962, Westside liberals appointed Gilbert Lindsay, a black, to his place on the 
City Council, then redrew that district, making it impossible for a Latino to 
be elected to the council for another next 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
Viewing society through a black-white television screen, white liberals 
excluded Latinos from early anti-poverty programs. Only the militancy of 
Chicano youth in the latter part of the '60s forced a re-evaluation. It was not 
until 1970 that Latinos were classified as an "identifiable ethnic minority 
with a pattern of discrimination." A consequence of historical amnesia is that 
it encourages the invention of a false reality, perpetuating the illusion of 
social and political equality. According to Julian Nava, who was on the Los 
Angeles school board from 1967 to 1979, the critical under-servicing of Latinos 
is a result of their under-representation. Alan Clayton, formerly of the L. A. 
County Chicano Employees Assn., estimates that just over 18% of the county's 
work force is Latino, while their projected population is about 35%. 
</P>
<P>
When considering their community, Angelenos should remember that they do not 
live in New York or Atlanta or Washington, D.C. Undoubtedly, a remapping of the 
county supervisor districts threatens many interest groups. But, as Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. once said, injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere. Equality 
cannot be achieved by maintaining a political underclass in the city of Nuestra 
Senora la Reina de Los Angeles.

ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times committed a serious breach of some long-established ground rules when 
one of its editorial writers strayed from affairs in Baku and City Hall and 
fired off a couple of hip shots at the Academy Award nominations ("Did They Do 
the Right Thing?" Feb. 16). 
</P>
<P>
Disagreeing with some aspect or other of the academy's list is a venerable 
sport, and we publish the nominations each year with the full understanding 
that everyone -- including each individual member of the academy -- will find a 
number of inclusions or omissions to quarrel with. That's exactly as it should 
be. 
</P>
<P>
But what The Times' writer is saying, when we chase him out from behind the 
skirts of Cardinal Newman, is that the academy made a racist decision. The 
people who write for the Calendar section, though they share your 
editorialist's inclination to look for sociological rather than aesthetic 
reasons for our omissions, would never make such a preposterous charge. At that 
point any writer who knows the turf pulls back and says "whoa." Accusing the 
academy of Philistinism is one thing; accusing these particular individuals of 
racism is quite another. 
</P>
<P>
Because as useful as it is to pretend otherwise at times, the truth is that the 
academy isn't some organization of anonymous strangers, it's a group made up of 
household names, the most distinguished names who work in this art form. Is The 
Times honestly suggesting that Stanley Kramer is a racist? Barbra Streisand? 
Richard Attenborough? John Sayles, Lily Tomlin, Dennis Potter, Dede Allen,

AND IF THE SANDINISTAS WIN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though the initial returns won't be available for hours -- and it may take days 
to fully sort out the results -- today's Nicaraguan election, one way or the 
other, offers Washington the opportunity for a full-scale review of its rocky 
relations with Managua. Has not the time come for the Bush Administration to 
end this futile war with Nicaragua -- one that has waxed hot and cold, but 
never off? Is it not time to follow the inspired lead of Costa Rican President 
Oscar Arias Sanchez and work to bring peace to a region that has known far too 
much war and sorrow for the last decade? 
</P>
<P>
Consider all the monitoring of Nicaragua's election -- perhaps the only news 
event more closely watched these past few weeks than the lives of Ivana and 
Donald Trump. Everyone from United Nations officials to former U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter have been down there, poking about for election irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
What's surprising is not that some have been found but that relatively few 
egregious ones appear to have been committed. This election may never be cited 
in political-science textbooks as a model of democratic process. But, to be 
fair, Nicaragua's voting may not have been any more irregular -- and perhaps 
less -- than the kind common not so very long ago in underdeveloped places like 
Cook County, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, of course, is that if the Sandinistas win, many Americans will 
believe that the election was rigged. This would be unfair to the Nicaraguan 
people: Inept incumbent governments win reelection all over the world simply by 
virtue of their incumbency. So in analyzing the voting this afternoon, and in 
the days to come, the fact that the "bad guys" won doesn't make the election 
bad or the results invalid. 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, American policy toward Nicaragua needs to change no matter 
who's in power there. The Reagan policy of supporting the Contras and CIA 
activity against the Sandinistas has brought us little but grief. Last 
Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that Washington 
will normalize its relationship with the Nicaraguan government even if the 
Sandinistas win -- if the election is fair. 
</P>
<P>
While Washington has the right to ask hard questions about this election, they 
shouldn't be so hard as to preclude the possibility of finally ending the cold 
war with Managua.

AIDS TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article (Part A, Feb. 16) about hospitals taking unauthorized AIDS tests 
hit an angry chord in me. 
</P>
<P>
Last year when I was scheduled for an operation the surgeon came to me and 
asked me to take an HIV test so he'd know whether to take special measures to 
protect his operating room staff. 
</P>
<P>
I thought about it overnight and then went back with a counter proposition. I'd 
agree to the test -- if he and his entire operating room staff would take the 
test too so I could eliminate anyone who registered HIV positive. After all, 
they'd be working with sharp instruments and if anyone who's HIV positive cut 
himself or herself and bled into my open wound, I'd be in big trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, the suggestion that I be tested was dropped very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
I have no idea whether I was tested secretly. But if those tests are being 
made, why not extend them to cover all hospital personnel and have the results 
available to patients whose lives might be jeopardized if an accident happens 
in treatment or surgery. Fair?

A GIANT HEADACHE FOR MOTHER RUSSIA; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: AN INTELLECTUAL BOOST TO NATIONALISTIC SOUNDINGS CANNOT GIVE MUCH 
COMFORT TO GORBACHEV -- OR OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DMITRI N. SHALIN, Dmitri N. Shalin is a visiting scholar at Harvard 
University's Russian Research Center. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spectacular developments on the periphery of the Soviet empire have, until 
recently, obscured the rise of Russian nationalism. Yet ethnic unrest in the 
Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic may well grow into the biggest 
headache yet for Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Early warning signs cropped up two years ago when the ultra-nationalist 
organization Pamyat blamed the country's ills on "the Judeo-Masonic 
conspiracy." The group didn't make much headway then (its candidates lost in 
last year's elections for the Congress of People's Deputies), mainly because it 
failed to attract support from the Russian intelligentsia. Now the situation 
has changed. 
</P>
<P>
Igor Shafarevich, a world-renowned mathematician and respected dissident, is 
one prominent Soviet intellectual who has lent his authority to the nationalist 
cause. His provocative essay, serialized in the literary magazine Nash 
Sovremennik, begins with the unobjectionable premise that ethnic Russians are 
entitled to national pride just as any other ethnic group. He rejects as 
russophobic any attempts to explain Russian history in terms of servility, 
intolerance and a craving for strong authority, pointing out -- correctly -- 
that any such charge addressed to other groups would be judged racist. 
</P>
<P>
Inexplicably, however, Shafarevich refuses to follow his own advice and 
proceeds to blame Jews for the misfortunes that Russia has suffered in this 
century. His arguments are as old as they are spurious: The dominant role that 
Jews gained in revolutionary organizations at the turn of the century caused 
Russia to abandon its predestined historical path; after the revolution, Jews 
effectively controlled repressive institutions in the country; the horrors that 
Russian people suffered under the Marxist regime are due largely to vengeful 
sentiments imparted to Jews by the Talmud. 
</P>
<P>
"Either remain foreigners without political rights," counsels Shafarevich to 
the "non-indigenous" elements residing in Russia, "or accept Russian 
citizenship based on love of homeland." 
</P>
<P>
One finds among the intellectuals who have caught the chauvinistic bug the 
names of prominent current writers such as Valentin Rasputin, Vladimir 
Soloukhin, Vasily Belov and Vadim Kozhinov. On various occasions, these authors 
have intimated the need to purge political, social and artistic institutions in 
the Russian republic from alien influences. 
</P>
<P>
Uri Bondarev, the powerful secretary of the Russian republic's Writers' Union, 
charged last fall that Russian writers are being pushed to the edge in their 
own land. Liberal magazines such as Ogonyok, Neva and Zvezda, he said, give far 
too much space to non-Russian writers; it is time for ethnic Russians to claim 
supremacy in the affairs of their own republic. 
</P>
<P>
One after another, speakers at the union's plenary meeting rose to condemn 
"cosmopolitan intellectuals" and swore to stamp out their pernicious influence. 
Some thanked Shafarevich for "the courageous stand" he took in the face of 
Jewish dominance. Anatoly Builov went further than anybody else in his avowed 
anti-Semitism: If life in the Soviet Union has been miserable for so many 
decades, he asked, wasn't it because so many Jews, some hiding under Russian 
identities, have occupied leading positions in the Soviet hierarchy? 
</P>
<P>
The ethnic purity espoused by Russian ultra-nationalists smacks of racism. 
Alexander Pushkin, a Russian literary icon, was descended from an Ethiopian 
slave brought to Russia by the Peter the Great. Boris Pasternak, the author of 
"Dr. Zhivago," was a Jew. Osip Mandelshtam, arguably the greatest Soviet poet, 
also was a Jew. Can anybody deny their contribution to Russian culture? 
</P>
<P>
Russian nationalism is not tenable as a political movement, particularly when 
it is fastened to dormant anti-Semitism, which is bound to breed racial hatred 
and violence. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the future of Russian nationalism, its immediate prospects are 
unsettling. The situation in the country brings to mind Germany in the waning 
years of the Weimar Republic, where the populace, worn down by an economic 
malaise and political uncertainty, cast about for scapegoats and clamored for a 
Fuehrer to spur the nation toward better times. We know what happened next: 
Hitler, the Holocaust, World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Those who think that the true legacy of Russian intelligentsia is not a quest 
for racial purity but a heightened capacity for compassion had better speak out 
now.

TAKING AIM AT 'VIRILE FEMALES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE F. WILL, George F. Will is a syndicated columnist.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While you read this column, three Americans will die of smoking-related 
illnesses. In 1986 the surgeon general reported that benzene concentrations in 
cigarettes up to 2,000 times greater than the amounts that caused Perrier water 
to be pulled from markets worldwide. What is surprising generations, is that 
public policy is so flaccid regarding the nation's foremost cause of 
preventable death. 
</P>
<P>
Policy may become more muscular in the aftermath of an anomalous controversy, 
one concerning a major corporation's attempts to market in a normal way a 
legal, indeed subsidized, product. The product is addictive (80% of adults 
using it want to quit; two-thirds have tried and failed), sickening and often 
lethal when used as it is intended to be used. 
</P>
<P>
Today's subject is cigarettes and the task, not exactly chivalric, is one of 
protecting "virile females." 
</P>
<P>
Virile females have various attributes, but the one most lovely to R.J. 
Reynolds Tobacco Co. is that they are minimally educated. According to a 
company marketing memo, virile females are 18 to 20 years old, have no 
education beyond high school, work in entry-level service or factory jobs, wear 
jeans and knit tops, watch "Roseanne," enjoy such events as motorcycle races, 
tractor pulls, monster truck competitions. Virile females are the segment 
targeted for the new brand "Dakota." 
</P>
<P>
America pays $52 billion annually -- $221 per American -- in health care, 
insurance costs and lost productivity because of tobacco, which every year 
kills more Americans than World War II did. The toll from tobacco is far higher 
than from cocaine, crack and heroin, combined. One thousand deaths a day. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Sen. Edward Kennedy chaired a spirited hearing that considered, 
among other good ideas, Sen. Bill Bradley's proposal to deny tax deductions for 
tobacco advertising -- $2.5 billion of it annually. The companies, spending 
$6.9 million a day on advertising and promotions, cheekily claim it is all 
aimed at winning market shares, and none of it is aimed at children. 
</P>
<P>
But about half of all smokers start by the time they are 15; few start after 
21. Only 10% of smokers switch brands in a year. Death and intelligence cost 
the cigarette companies 6,000 customers a day. That many new smokers must be 
found daily to keep the companies running in place. 
</P>
<P>
Cigarette advertising plays upon teen-agers' desire for autonomy and anxiety 
about social acceptance and sexual allure. If just 3% of cigarette sales are to 
underage children, that market segment spends $1 billion, giving the companies 
$150 million in profits. 
</P>
<P>
New smokers are disproportionately women and minorities. Forty years ago, just 
3% of women with cancer had lung cancer. Now 20% do. 
</P>
<P>
You say cigarette advertising is off television? Look again. Cigarette signs 
are in most of the key television camera sight lines in sports arenas and 
stadiums. On NBC's 93-minute telecast of the 1989 Marlboro Grand Prix, there 
were 4,997 images of Marlboro signs. 
</P>
<P>
Targeted marketing, a common tactic, is now considered disgusting when the 
targeted group is picked because it is badly educated and informed, and hence 
manipulable, and the product being marketed is injurious. But senior executives 
who set the tobacco companies' marketing strategies do not have daughters who 
fit the "virile female" profile.

SOUTH AFRICA: BLACK MAJORITY RULE MEANS THE SURRENDER OF POWER -- POLITICAL

CAPE TOWN, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Africa is at the crossroads. Either we deny the reality of various racial 
and ethnic groups, or peoples, for the sake of a non-existing non-racial 
society, or we recognize the facts of our population's composition and take 
notice of the rise of various nationalisms here, in Eastern Europe and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The reforms advocated by the government of President Frederik W. de Klerk are a 
departure from the principle of self-determination. What it offers as 
power-sharing is really a surrender of power and control. The government's new 
(lack of) philosophy envisages a country in which separateness is abolished and 
all peoples and racial groups take part in executive and legislative functions. 
The government pretends to adhere to democratic principles, and promises to 
prevent the domination of one group by another, but it fails to say how power 
is to be shared between 5 million whites and 25 million blacks, or how 
domination of the latter over whites could be avoided in a democratic 
dispensation where numbers necessarily will decide. 
</P>
<P>
The ethnic awakening and demand for political self-determination in Eastern 
Europe has been political practice in South Africa for the past four decades 
but is now being betrayed. We were well ahead of the perception of Rutgers 
University Prof. Albert Blaustein when he said: "Group rights is 
legal-constitutional terminology for the new ethnicity of which the world has 
become increasingly conscious. . . . Studying the legal-constitutional response 
to the new nationalism -- the manifestation of the new ethnicity -- is 
essential in understanding the evolution of modern human rights. For there is 
an inherent conflict between individual human rights and the rights demanded 
by, for and on the basis of special groups." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling party in South Africa is still paying lip service to the concept of 
a so-called plural society, but its "totally new South Africa" disregards the 
principle of self-determination for the different peoples -- their right to 
determine their own forms of government. 
</P>
<P>
The new emphasis is on negotiation and consensus. The Conservative Party 
maintains that our people's claim to land and our right to govern ourselves are 
not negotiable. We reject the idea of consensus government because it means 
dictatorship, which is not acceptable anywhere, except perhaps in Third World 
countries. In the long run, the majority decides in any democratic 
dispensation. 
</P>
<P>
That is why a one-man, one-vote system in a unitary South Africa, with its 
disparate communities or national groups, will not guarantee democratic rule, 
but domination of smaller nations by the numbers of the numerically stronger 
ones or combination of black nations. South Africa has a deeply divided 
population -- along racial, ethnic, cultural, language and religious lines. The 
differences are more significant than those between, for instance, the English 
and the French, or the Flemish and the Walloons in Belgium. To force together 
such largely disparate peoples, cultures and races, will amount to a form of 
tyranny, the very opposite of democratic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Before the political somersault of the current government, remarkable progress 
had been made toward the development of separate freedoms for the various 
peoples, ethnic groups, in their own territories, or homelands. That is the 
partition policy consistently advocated by the Conservative Party. Seven black 
peoples -- in Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Transkei, Ciskei, Bophuthatswana 
and Venda -- accepted political independence in their own territories. Six 
others -- Kwazulu, Qua-qua, Lebowa, Gazankulu, Kwa-Ndebels and Kangwane -- 
accepted self-government, the final stage before independence, also in their 
own territories. They endorse a policy of separate freedom, or partition. We 
say that such development is not turning back the clock, but confirms that we 
are in step with modern developments elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Although white people in South Africa were formerly inclined to decide how 
blacks would manage their affairs and develop their communities, whites now 
concentrate on protection of their own freedom, political structures, economic 
development, land and security. We argue: If minority peoples such as the 
Swazi, Sotho, Tswana, Xhosa, Venda, are entitled to their own lands and forms 
of government, then that principle should equally apply to the Afrikaner people 
-- Afrikaans and English speakers of South Africa, white South Africans. 
</P>
<P>
This claim is contrary to the demands for black-majority rule over the whole 
country made by the African National Congress and Nelson Mandela, the South 
African Communist Party and other radical leftist organizations. And if these 
demands are not met, they say they will resort to "armed struggle." 
</P>
<P>
The release of Mandela and unbanning of the ANC and Communist Party have not 
brought peace. The unrest, violence, arson and threats of armed rebellion 
continue. And these people have been invited to take part in negotiations for a 
new constitution that also includes whites. They have demanded acceptance of 
the principle of majority rule even before the talks start. Majority rule and 
internal peace are two sides of the same coin, says Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
That means the surrender of power, political suicide for the white man in this 
country. That, of course, is totally unacceptable to any people with 
self-respect and a long history of freedom and resistance against threats of 
domination. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the two choices are: black majority rule over the entire country, 
including whites, or separate freedoms for various peoples under their own 
governments in their own territories. The latter is the only moral solution.

A caged African lion ripped off part of its owner's arm while the animal keeper

HUGE CACHE OF COUNTERFEIT CASSETTES, 6 SUSPECTS SEIZED; 
</P>
<P>
TAPE PIRACY: CASE COULD BE LARGEST EVER IN CALIFORNIA. DEPUTIES ALSO CONFISCATE 
$89,000 IN CASH.

Six Mexican citizens have been arrested in the largest seizure of counterfeit 
cassette recordings ever made in California, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The bootleg tapes and recording equipment -- estimated to have cost the 
recording industry $45 million annually in lost sales -- were discovered at two 
Pico Rivera residences after deputies investigated a 911 emergency call. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Pat Hunter said the anonymous caller had hung up, but patrol cars were 
dispatched to the address. When deputies arrived, they found thousands of 
finished counterfeit cassette tapes and enough blank tapes to make thousands 
more, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
Recording equipment found at the house was believed to be capable of producing 
15,000 to 20,000 cassettes a day, Hunter said. The tapes would have netted a 
profit of about $300,000 a week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
An official from the Recording Industry Assn. of America arrived at the house 
and described the counterfeit operation as the biggest ever uncovered in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not know if (the tapes are) Latin music, American music, rock 'n' roll 
music, or what," Hunter said. "It's just a variety of music." 
</P>
<P>
In the garage of the first home, deputies found another 50,000 finished 
cassette tapes. Information at that house led deputies to another home in the 
area where they found $89,000 in cash and documents that indicated 
counterfeiting activity, Hunter said. The money, in $100 bills, was stashed in 
a cookie jar and hidden in the attic, the deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested were Ruben Perez, 18; Trino Becerra, 22; Fidel Becerra, 23; Ramon 
Gutierez, 18; Pastor Sandoval, 22; and Aurelio Moreno, 46. They were booked on 
suspicion of tape piracy and were being held at the Los Angeles County 
sheriff's substation in Pico Rivera. Bail was set at $5,000 each.

<TEXT>
<P>
Telecast of the winning numbers in the California Lotto was delayed more than 
40 minutes Saturday night after the person who operates the machine forgot to 
hit the button that releases the balls. 
</P>
<P>
The automatic number selector shakes numbered balls around in a plastic bubble, 
then drops down seven balls with the winning numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The tape of the drawing was not telecast or the numbers publicly announced 
until 8:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
An auditor and security officials were on hand to monitor the selection, "to 
keep it all honest," said John Schade, spokesman for the state lottery. "So 
that there is no question that the numbers that were announced were the ones 
that came down at that time." 
</P>
<P>
The winning numbers were 44, 30, 33, 18, 36 and 49. The bonus number was 43.

<P>
FAMILY PORTRAITS AND PERSONAL ESCAPADES BY ITABARI NJERI (TIMES BOOKS: $17.95; 
226 PP.; 0-8129-1805-3) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gail Lumet Buckley, Buckley is author of a family memoir, The Hornes (Alfred 
A. Knopf). She is currently writing a book on the African-American military 
experience. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The title of this collection of nonfiction stories linked mostly by family 
relationships (a first book that began as fiction but ended as "literal truth") 
comes from an African-American proverb: "Every shut-eye ain't sleep; every 
good-bye ain't gone." 
</P>
<P>
In demonstrating that life's farewells are not necessarily permanent, 
journalist/essayist Itabari Njeri travels to and away from a name, a culture, a 
gift and -- most of all -- an extended Afro-American/Afro-Caribbean family that 
is "too large, too loving in ways that negate the love itself, and too 
demanding." 
</P>
<P>
It is a journey of conversions, as well as discoveries and farewells: from the 
child who loved music and made it a "god"; to the girl who changed her name and 
acculturation -- seeing things only in black and white; to the woman who 
discovers the necessary value of synthesis. She takes a path from extreme and 
demanding "gods" to "balance." 
</P>
<P>
Among the extreme forces in Njeri's life is her enormous family. It is a 
veritable New World bazaar -- an assortment of aunts, uncles, cousins and 
grandparents of varying colors and sizes whose multi-ethnic quality could 
belong only to the Americas. The author is African, East Indian, Amer-Indian 
and English -- the great-great-great-granddaughter of a rum-running English 
pirate whose castle still stands in Barbados. 
</P>
<P>
But, the author feels, this background would be deemed improbable by most 
Americans. "So institutionalized," she says, "is the ignorance of our history, 
our culture, our everyday existence that, often, we do not even know 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Njeri, however, is determined to "know" -- and to write the truth. She is 
obsessed by family secrets, for they are also keys to self-knowledge. And 
within the natural duality of black-American life, family secrets also can be 
the means of understanding a whole people. 
</P>
<P>
Njeri's opening story, "Granddaddy," outlines a journey to Georgia to solve a 
major family mystery: the search for the man responsible for the death of her 
grandfather more than 20 years before. All her life, she had heard the family 
story that drunken, drag-racing, white boys had collided with her grandfather's 
car and killed him -- but the accident had been covered up. 
</P>
<P>
She finds the killer, but no emotional catharsis. The rumors that made her 
grandfather a martyr to racism just aren't true. There was no drag-racing, and 
no cover-up. There was, in fact, a monetary settlement in favor of the widow -- 
something that she (the grandfather's second wife) had neglected to tell the 
rest of the family. 
</P>
<P>
There is no guilt, but there is no innocence either. Betrayal and casual racism 
pervade. A white doctor, considered a family friend, calls the grandfather a 
"bad man" who basically deserved to die because he favored integration and 
belonged to the NAACP. And when her grandfather's wife (who looked white) ran 
through the streets in her nightgown to the accident scene, a white policeman 
said, "Don't worry yourself ma'am. It's just a nigger." 
</P>
<P>
The truth leaves Njeri only with unresolved anger and bitterness against an 
"insidious . . . social system that . . . seemingly left no one to blame, as if 
systems do not bear the marks of their creators." 
</P>
<P>
Njeri is a gifted and generous writer who rarely hides her feelings. These 
explorations of family myths and revelations of family conflict are a tumble of 
colliding emotions -- love, hate, anger, regret -- and are often very funny. 
She is most successful in delineating family quirks and eccentricities. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with families, of course, is coming to terms with them and finding 
a separate identity. Like the "Sleeping Beauty" ballet with its gift-bestowing 
good and bad fairies, every child feels both blessed and cursed at birth by its 
family. Every gift is double-edged. 
</P>
<P>
From her philosopher/historian father, who sang like Irish tenor John 
McCormack, the author receives her greatest gift -- a beautiful voice. She has 
the "celestial vibration," her father says. But she feels love from him only 
when she sings, for he is an abusive, embittered alcoholic -- an 
"African-American intellectual in crisis," his career thwarted by racism and 
his own Marxist politics. She admires him as a teacher but hates him as a 
father. And parental separations are a fact of her Brooklyn and Harlem 
growing-up. 
</P>
<P>
From her mother, a lapsed Catholic professional nurse of West Indian heritage, 
she learns to "persevere with grace." But her mother refuses to admit that 
alcohol has destroyed her husband and most of her family. This large West 
Indian family also is cursed by "colorism" -- Alice Walker's word for the 
African-American obsession with skin color. 
</P>
<P>
"Colorism" has wreaked havoc. Because Cousin Jeff looked like Ricky Nelson, he 
had to prove that he was the "baddest nigger on the block," finding heroin, 
prison and death on a Harlem rooftop in the process. But Great Aunt May passed 
for white to join the segregated ILGWU as a "Romanian," and her brown-skinned 
sister, Ruby (the author's grandmother), refuses to speak to her. 
</P>
<P>
Religion is another source of conflict. At Cousin Jeff's wake, the bemused 
priest obviously tries to figure out the relationship of the white man in the 
coffin to "all these very dark and very light and everything-between people," 
as decidedly black Protestant "Yes Lords" and "Amens" are interspersed among 
the "Hail Marys." 
</P>
<P>
Cultural conflicts ultimately come between the author and music. Caught up in 
1970s political fervency, Njeri, a gifted vocal student at New York's High 
School of Music and Art, breaks with classicism. She wants to be Leontyne 
Price, but she gives up the "devil's" music to join Amiri Baraka's African 
nationalist movement. 
</P>
<P>
Baraka renames Jill Moreland "Itabari": Swahili/Arabic for worthy of trust. 
"Njeri" is provided by her non-nationalist mother. It is Kikuyu for worthy of a 
warrior -- which provoked some amusing reactions when she actually visited 
Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
But African nationalism is a dead end. She finds a political family that is 
almost as oppressive as her biological one, and the nationalist message of 
self-love and self-esteem sometimes sounds suspiciously like the enemy's racism 
-- against "white people in general" and "Jews in particular." 
</P>
<P>
A final stab at music -- this time "doo-wop" -- is another dead end. She gives 
up music for journalism. There is a distinct sense of lost love, and regret, in 
this book. The author mourns her voice with a sense of helpless fatalism: ". . 
. what sense is there talking about a gift one failed to use as one might have, 
could have, should have." 
</P>
<P>
But she understands that this first love was a victim of politics, family 
psychology and her own youth. Quoting African-American author Trey Ellis, on 
the new "Black Aesthetic" that "shamelessly borrows and reassembles across both 
race and class lines," the author says, "Had I understood that as a teen-ager, 
I might still be singing today." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe growing up requires giving up? Njeri has found "balance," she says, and 
intellectual satisfaction in writing. She also, in a rather forced ending, 
finally finds true love. He is a Latino who debates whether minstrel shows are 
racist distortions or only a question of the sincerest form of flattery. The 
debate nearly ends the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
But Njeri has reached the point in her journey where cultural differences 
matter less than emotional synthesis -- the only sane path between the rock and 
hard place of black and white in America.

A POET ON THE PROWL; 
</P>
<P>
DEVICES AND DESIRES BY P.D. JAMES (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 435 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles Champlin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phyllis Dorothy White James can now safely be called the pre-eminent English 
writer of mysteries. "Devices and Desires" is a main selection of the 
Book-of-the-Month Club, as was her previous book, "A Taste for Death." It will 
have a first cloth printing of 175,000 and a Quality Paperback Book Club 
edition to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Her books, like those of John Le Carre there and Tony Hillerman and Elmore 
Leonard here, have slipped the comfortable bonds of genre to reach far wider 
audiences, helped by the television dramatizations of some of her earlier books 
such as "Death of an Expert Witness." 
</P>
<P>
She is not the heiress-apparent to Dame Agatha Christie and reportedly does not 
enjoy being thought such. Christie's ingeniously improbable plottings are not 
James' forte, and commercially, Christie, the reprint rights to whose works 
changed hands a couple of years ago for $92 million, remains in a class by 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
James is her own voice, creating her own tradition. Her writing does have 
echoes of a longer, Victorian tradition: the spacious novel with its loving 
attention to environments and atmospheres, the delineation of character (which 
Christie tended to skim over with telegraphic speed) and the conveying of 
nuance in relationships and moments. "Devices and Desires" is a comfortably 
spacious 424 pages long, as tidy and well-furnished as a Victorian parlor. 
</P>
<P>
Her continuing protagonist, the poet-detective Adam Dalgliesh, a sensitive 
loner touched with sadness, has brought out a new, slim volume of verse and, 
resisting his publisher's desire to push it like a candy bar, has retreated to 
the Norfolk coast to compose his soul in a converted windmill he has inherited, 
with a sizable sum of money, from a beloved, bird-watching aunt. 
</P>
<P>
James' descriptions of the Norfolk coastline in its remote, spare beauty, quite 
unlike the overdeveloped littoral elsewhere, appears to be born of close 
familiarity and abiding love. It is lovely to read about. 
</P>
<P>
Dalgliesh's only chore is to deliver proofs of a cookbook to its local author. 
It is enough to embroil him reluctantly in the local scene. The author is the 
sister of a man who directs a nuclear-power station near the sea. The station 
is under a publicity assault generated by an earnest, penniless young man who 
lives nearby and is sheltering a homeless mother and child. 
</P>
<P>
A serial killer of young women, whom the media has named the Whistler, is 
stalking the vicinity (James is very good at evoking the horror of the 
confrontations) and Dalgliesh is sought out by a former London colleague who 
now heads the local CID and who regards Dalgliesh with a mixture of respect and 
scarcely muted resentment. (James is very, very good at the shoals and 
cross-currents of relationships.) 
</P>
<P>
The large dramatis personae includes the director's ambitious assistant, whom 
he is attempting to phase out as his mistress, too; a retired clergyman, his 
wife and the nice young woman who looks out for them; a free-spirited painter 
attempting, with the help of a beguiling and precocious daughter, to care for 
his motherless brood; and various boffins and stenos from the power-plant 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
The director's assistant is murdered, seemingly the latest victim of the 
Whistler. But it turns out that the Whistler had been nabbed not long before 
the killing, and a key question is: Who knew, Who didn't? Even Dalgliesh is at 
least briefly a suspect; the victim was found at the shore, not far from the 
windmill. ("I suspect everyone . . . and no one," a sleuth once remarked.) 
</P>
<P>
As Greyhound used to say, getting there (in this case to the solution) is half 
the fun. In "Designs and Desires," as in many mysteries, it is substantially 
more than half the fun. It is an irony particularly applicable to James that 
the more extensive the scene-settings and the more (Henry) Jamesian the 
characterizations, the more rickety and anti-climactic the denouement can seem. 
</P>
<P>
The detecting of who did in the assistant is intricate and professional, and 
although it mounts to what used to be called a sock finish (and fiery as well), 
it also feels oddly perfunctory, like a grand opera built around a visit to 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
As if she were aware that the atmospheres (even the evidence of careful 
research about the perils and controversies attending nuclear power) were not 
enough, James has attached a subplot, involving a pair of minor-league 
terrorists at the plant, that is arbitrary and owes more to the work of 
Alistair MacLean, say, than to her own sensitive interpretations of present 
society. 
</P>
<P>
She is not a poet of the abnormal, like her nearest rival, Ruth Rendell, who 
peers into the darkest recesses of the aberrant psyche as no one else does. But 
James is in her own right a poet of, perhaps, more universal men and women and 
especially those whose lives are touched with crime and death. 
</P>
<P>
This is James on Terry Rickards, Dalgliesh's touchy colleague: "Dalgliesh 
thought of him as a type of police officer less common than formerly but still 
not rare; the conscientious and incorruptible detective of limited imagination 
and somewhat greater intelligence who had never supposed that the evil of the 
world should be condoned because it was frequently inexplicable and its 
perpetrators unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
This is Dalgliesh -- on the same page; Rickards' wife is expecting momentarily 
-- remembering his wife and son who died at childbirth: "His memory of her, 
which for years, a traitor to grief and their love, he had resolutely tried to 
suppress because the pain had seemed unbearable, had gradually been replaced by 
a boyish, romantic dream of gentleness and beauty now fixed forever beyond the 
depredation of time. His newborn son's face he could still recall vividly and 
sometimes did in his dreams, that white unsullied look of sweet, knowledgeable 
contentment, as if, in a brief moment of life, he had seen and known all there 
was to know, seen it and rejected it." 
</P>
<P>
Passages of such eloquence and sensitivity are not frequently come upon in 
fiction anywhere, and they have earned James her rightful pre-eminence. In 
context, they suggest that crime fiction as such has no limits, only 
limitations.

TALKING TURKEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was very surprised by a passage in your article on Azerbaijan, in which you 
deal with the close similarities among all Turkish languages (Endpapers: 
"Azerbaijan and 'A Peace to End All Peace' " by Jack Miles; Book Review, Feb. 
4). 
</P>
<P>
I have been told by Jews from Tabriz -- in northern Iran, and therefore 
speaking the local Turkish language -- that as they came through Ankara on 
their way to Israel, it was nearly impossible for them to understand the 
language of the Turks proper, except for cardinal numbers and so on. 
</P>
<P>
If they are right, then there is no closer relation between the Turkish spoken 
in Anatolia and in Tabriz, than there is between such Semitic tongues as Hebrew 
and Arabic. Again, the numbers are alike (and so is the word for peace). But 
otherwise, you cannot understand Arabic just by knowing Hebrew -- or, for that 
matter, Amharic, another Semitic language. 
</P>
<P>
True, you can understand any Spanish dialect if you are Hispanic. But, then, 
this is one language, unlike so many different Turkish tongues. 
</P>
<P>
My question is, then, how did you reach such a conclusion? Are you yourself an 
expert in those languages? Or were you told so by an interested party on the 
Turkish side? 
</P>
<P>
If the Soviet Union is to disintegrate, then this can be a really crucial 
question. Otherwise, having read all the current literature on Azerbaijan, I 
have never read one word about the Azeris feeling themselves to be Turks, or 
even close to them. 
</P>
<P>
I hope you can answer those questions. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The claim made in Endpapers, Feb. 4, was not that all the Turkic languages are 
mutually comprehensible but that those of historic Turkestan (Soviet Central 
Asia) are. One source for this is Robin Milner-Gulland with Nikolai Dejevsky, 
"Cultural Atlas of Russia and the Soviet Union" (Facts on File publishers): "In 
four of the republics (of Soviet Central Asia) the languages are Turkic and 
similar enough to be largely intercomprehensible; in Tadzhikistan (the fifth), 
an Iranian (hence Indo-European) tongue is spoken" (Page 217). As among 
Turkestan, Azerbaijan and Turkey, the continuity claimed was cultural and 
religious, with the suggestion that in Islamic regions this kind of continuity 
may count for more than nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there, in addition, a degree of national continuity among ethnic Turks? 
David Fromkin's book, "A Peace to End All Peace" (Henry Holt), shows that there 
was some in the early 1920s. Enver Pasha of Ottoman Turkey campaigned in 
Azerbaijan and was stopped by the Russians only in Bukhara, in what is now the 
Uzbek Soviet Federated Socialist Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 As Robert Conquest wrote in 1957 (reprinted in Book Review, Feb. 11), "(the 
Russians) have split up the nationalities of Turkestan politically and 
attempted to exaggerate the diversity and to deny the common features of their 
languages and cultures; and they have provided them with false histories." To 
some extent the Russian effort has succeeded. Writing in The Times (Jan. 28), 
reporter Doyle McManus quoted Tadeusz Swietochowski of Monmouth College: 
"Before the advent of Russian rule, the term Azerbaijan was rarely used; people 
defined themselves as Turks or Tatars or Persians. It was only under Russian 
and Soviet rule that they acquired a distinct Azerbaijani nationality. The 
Soviets tried to split the Muslim community along national lines. They said, 
'You're not a Muslim; you're a Kazakh or a Tadzhik or a Tatar.' It was the old 
principle of divide and rule. But now their chickens are coming home to roost." 
</P>
<P>
 The question is: Just which chickens are they? As Don Shojai points out in the 
following letter, Islam spread to Turkestan from Persia (Iran) and brought much 
of Persian culture with it. Despite the linguistic barrier, the Islamic link 
between these regions may yet count for more than the particularist ethnic 
identities encouraged by Soviet rule. The most violent demonstrations to date 
have been in Dushanbe, Tadzhikistan. 
</P>
<P>
 No country has been more outspoken than Iran in condemning the Soviet actions 
in Baku, Azerbaijan. And according to a report in the Washington Post (Jan. 
20), protesters have carried Islamic flags and posters of the late Ayatollah 
Khomeini during some so-called nationalist demonstrations in Baku; in Tashkent, 
Uzbekistan; and in other Soviet Muslim cities.

A comment and an observation: 
</P>
<P>
The idea that enmity between believers in the religions of the Book is a cause 
of Azerbaijani/Armenian fighting has the ring of probable truth. 
</P>
<P>
But I think we must go much further back in time to tap that spring. Of course, 
it is understandable that both East and West will use whatever sticks are 
available. Kipling was on to something. 
</P>
<P>
I smiled when I noticed that the camera had picked up the edge of your 
paste-up, making the words "Azerbaijani attacks against Jews" look as though 
underlined. At least in my copy.

FOR YOUNG ADULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK JONATHAN HARRIS, Harris' most recent young adult book is Come the 
Morning (Bradbury Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neither our educational system nor our society greatly encourages children to 
cultivate their facility for make-believe. At school, children quickly learn to 
value fact over fancy, common sense over poetry. The older they grow, usually 
the more self-conscious they become about making up stories and the narrower 
and more constrained their fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
The best books retain the fluidity and richness of a child's imaginary life. 
They also show how imagination can transform and recreate our world. 
</P>
<P>
Lucie Babbidge's House by the late Sylvia Cassedy (Thomas Y. Crowell: $12.95; 
243 pp.) is about an 11-year-old girl whose imagination is her only resource. 
At school, her teacher, the archetypal spinster Miss Pimm, constantly holds her 
up as a bad example to the class. Lucie's plain; she's obstinate; she barely 
speaks, and when she does, it's in a croak. The other girls ridicule her as 
goosey-Loosey; Miss Pimm despairs of her future. 
</P>
<P>
At home, everything is different. Over tea and ginger cookies with Mumma and 
her 5-year-old brother Emmett, Lucie rewrites her day, converting her 
humiliations into triumphs. Mumma and Dadda think Lucie bright and beautiful 
and are always loving and appreciative. Life among the Babbidges is elegant and 
faintly British, like their afternoon teas and conversations in the drawing 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, there are a few suspicious aspects to Lucie's life. Olive, the Babbidges' 
maid, often sounds like Miss Pimm, and the Babbidges themselves resemble the 
Pendeltons, an English family whose adventures Miss Pimm reads each day to her 
class. There is also the mystery of Delia Hornsby, a girl from England, who 
miraculously answers Lucie's letter to her dead great-great grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Cassedy, who died of cancer last year, cleverly and subtly constructed this 
novel so that the reader only gradually comes to realize how much of Lucie's 
world is make-believe. Not until a third of the way through do we discover that 
Lucie's parents are dead, and that she is a waif among waifs, an outcast at the 
orphanage. By presenting Lucie's fantasy world as real, Cassedy shows how 
imaginary life sometimes can be more vivid than real life. Cassedy's funny, 
poignant novel is a testament to the healing and transformative powers of the 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
In Paul Fleischman's Saturnalia (A Charlotte Zolotow Book/Harper &amp; Row: 
$12.95; 110 pp.), it is the author's imagination that transforms his subject 
matter. Fleischman, a Newbery Award-winning author, returns to a territory he 
has successfully explored before -- the early New England Puritans. 
</P>
<P>
Fleischman takes an unconventional approach to writing historical fiction for 
children. Although the novel has a 14-year-old as its central character -- a 
Narragansett captured by the Puritans in their Indian wars -- the book neither 
focuses exclusively on his struggles nor is confined solely to his point of 
view. Instead, Fleischman smoothly shifts perspective back and forth between 
the Indians and a colorful cross section of Boston life in December, 1681. 
</P>
<P>
Among his unusual ensemble are a tithing man "walking the lightless lanes of 
sin, routing out evil and blasphemy"; a grieving and guilt-ridden woodcarver; a 
cruel eyeglass maker; a pompous wig maker, and his impudent servant and tutor 
in love. The author shifts tone as easily as he does point of view, mixing 
tragedy and humor, irony and farce in a textured and evocative meditation on 
our colonial forebears. 
</P>
<P>
The central figure who links all these disparate characters is the Indian 
captive who has become a printers' apprentice. William in the white world, 
Weetasket in the Indian, he wanders the Boston streets at night, playing his 
bone flute and searching for his twin brother in his lost past. 
</P>
<P>
Like William, Fleischman also is attempting to recapture the past. His 
inventive approach to envisioning our colonial beginnings challenges readers to 
stretch their own imaginative powers and to see the world from a variety of 
viewpoints. Just as imagination allows Lucie to integrate the separate parts of 
herself, it also enables us to reclaim our past and discover its relevance to 
our present.

THE CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: MEMORIES, MYTHS AND MIDRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SHANNON, Shannon's recent books include Sea Gifts (Godine) and the 
critical study Arnold Lobel (Twayne). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While memory is the universal weft of story, not all memories have the kernel 
of universality essential to create a good story. In Thunder Cake (Philomel: 
$14.95; 32 pp.; ages 4-8), Patricia Polacco succeeds, recalling a childhood 
fear that will be familiar to many of us. One day when thunder began crackling 
ominously from afar, Polacco's immigrant grandmother asked her to hastily 
gather ingredients from around the farm for a "thunder cake." By the time the 
storm loomed directly overhead, Polacco was celebrating her new-found bravery 
with cake and tea from the samovar. 
</P>
<P>
Though Polacco's narrative is self-conscious at times, it advances swiftly with 
a balance of humor and tension. As the text focuses on a little girl's fears, 
the illustrations celebrate the uniqueness of the grandmother's heritage. 
Evoking the textures and styles of traditional Russian clothing and 
knickknacks, they are no doubt drawn from the images that filled Polacco's eyes 
as a child. An informality of both line and action further contributes to the 
book's sense of warmth and immediacy. 
</P>
<P>
The story of childhood is one of energy, discovery and a growing sense of self. 
Few children's books recount this better than "A Hole Is to Dig" and its 
companion, the Open House for Butterflies, both by Ruth Krauss and Maurice 
Sendak. The latter, recently reprinted (Harper &amp; Row: $10.95; 48 pp.; ages 
4-8), asks one of the many children who act out stories and play with words in 
these pages: "If you went out and forgot your pretend friends, where would you 
go when you went back for them?" And another: "If you run out of cereal, can 
you run into it again?" 
</P>
<P>
Giving body and breadth to these young voices, Sendak's pen-and-ink 
illustrations evoke the spontaneous choreography of children at play. Together, 
Krauss and Sendak have created a lasting celebration of childhood's importance. 
Or, as one child puts it: "A baby makes the mother and father -- otherwise 
they're just plain people." 
</P>
<P>
A Long Hard Journey: The Story of the Pullman Porter (Walker: $17.95; 144 pp.; 
ages 10-14) stretches through U.S. history like the railroad itself, connecting 
faraway places and times. After the Civil War, Pullman cars provided 
respectable employment for many African Americans. But good news faded to bad 
as work conditions worsened and pay became insulting. In 1934, prospects began 
to brighten when the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters became the first 
all-black union to join the American Federation of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
"The story of the Pullman Porter" is a complex one, covering a great deal of 
time and intense emotions, but Patricia and Frederick McKissack keep their 
narrative honest, understanding the dignities and fallibilities of the porters. 
Sometimes good people make poor decisions, they write, and good decisions 
become mistakes as social circumstances change. 
</P>
<P>
Strength of story also enriches Barbara Bash's scientific narrative, Tree of 
Life: The World of the African Baobab (Sierra Club Books: $14.95; 32 pp.; 
grades 1-5). As the tale opens, a group of African bushmen point toward an old 
tree, explaining that its branches became gnarled and knotted because a 
careless hyena planted it upside down. In every stage of its yearly cycle, the 
baobab tree gives life to different species in different ways. Leafless, it is 
home to chameleons and snakes. Birds arrive when the rains bring leaves. Bush- 
baby monkeys and bats drink the nectar of its blossoms, and impalas eat the 
same flowers once they fall to the ground. Baboon and man enjoy the fruit that 
follows. For man, the baobab holds honey and medicines as well. 
</P>
<P>
By following the overlapping cycles of these species, Bash creates a narrative 
that echoes the enduring rhythm of the tree itself. From the hush of her color 
illustrations to her text in calligraphy, Bash's thoughtful observations have 
transformed the facts of the amazing baobab into an involving tale of life. 
</P>
<P>
As the title story of Marc Gellman's Does God Have a Big Toe? (Harper &amp; 
Row: $16.70; 90 pp.; all ages) explains, our desire to question the unknown is 
as constant as the impossibility of finding pat answers. One solution to the 
paradox is to celebrate the questions themselves with more questions! 
Acknowledging the impossibility of explaining what various Bible stories mean, 
Gellman widens them with 21 new tales about the stories, called Midrash. At 
once funny and tender, all 21 resonate with fresh awareness, encouraging 
readers to search for their own insights. 
</P>
<P>
Some stories bounce with fresh twists. The parting of the Red Sea, for example, 
is experienced from the point of view of startled fish. Other tales are retold 
from the perspective of any suburban kid. Beginning the story of Babel, Gellman 
writes, "Every person spoke the same language. All of which made life very 
easy. Getting the news was easy, and you didn't have to learn a new language in 
high school." The playfulness and renewed innocence of these stories are 
beautifully extended by Oscar deMejo's naive paintings. Rich for reading aloud 
and savoring alone, "Does God Have a Big Toe?" is an intriguing delight.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: CHILDHOOD YEARS A MEMOIR BY JUN'ICHIRO TANIZAKI TRANSLATED

<P>
It's difficult to ascertain whether the noted Japanese writer Jun'ichiro 
Tanizaki (known in the United States as the author of "The Makioka Sisters") 
based his fiction on his life or if he conceived this self-conscious memoir as 
a explication of his novels. He says the roots of his work lie in his memories, 
offering examples of incidents in school or at home that served as models for 
fictional encounters. 
</P>
<P>
"Childhood Years" resonates with an almost Proustian mania for trivia, 
including now-vanished addresses where a house stood -- or a crime was 
committed. (As a boy, Tanizaki apparently was fascinated by a lovely geisha who 
murdered her lover, provoking a major scandal and providing an image of fearful 
beauty.) His recollections of pre-World War II Tokyo are often fascinating but 
slightly repellent. Tanizaki seems obsessed with the unpleasant elements of 
urban life, and recounts problems of personal hygiene and his uncle's obsession 
with another beautiful geisha in grim detail. A handful of photographs, 
apparently taken from a family album, are so badly printed that they appear as 
little more than black rectangles.

ENDPAPERS: 'FIFTY-SEVEN VARIETIES LOWER THAN A TURKEY BUZZARD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER HAY, Hay is the author of six books; the latest is Broadway Anecdotes 
(Oxford University Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent publication of H. L. Mencken's diary caused the kind of furor that 
the curmudgeon of American letters would have loved. A good deal of this 
post-mortem controversy has to do with Henry Louis Mencken's status as the 
patron saint of journalists. 
</P>
<P>
It has been generally pointed out in the saint's defense that he was 
uncomplimentary not only about Jews and blacks, but practically everybody under 
the sun, including fellow journalists. The point that gets lost is that the 
offensiveness of some passages in the long-withheld diary looks tame when 
compared with the avalanche of vituperative invective hurled at this 
independent thinker during most of his career. 
</P>
<P>
In 1928, two years before Mencken began writing his diary, Alfred A. Knopf, his 
regular publisher, brought out a small volume of "Menckeniana -- A 
Schimplexicon," meaning (in German) "a lexicon of abuse." It contained 
selections from editorials, reviews and general hate mail printed about Mencken 
when he was in his mid-40s. 
</P>
<P>
The title is misleading, since the reader might have expected the quotes to 
have been authored by Mencken himself, while attributing them to newspapers and 
individuals who had attracted his scorn. He was certainly capable of 
perpetrating such a hoax: The celebrated fabrication about the introduction of 
the first American bathtub -- how it had been banned in Boston, except on 
medical prescription, and how Virginia imposed a $30 tax on each tub, etc. -- 
still is remembered as a practical joke on the order of Orson Welles' radio 
version of "War of the Worlds." Mencken had written the piece to amuse his 
readers during World War I, but these "historical facts" came to be reprinted 
in reference books and countless articles for decades despite the author's 
repeated attempts to expose his own fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"During the single year of 1926," the publisher points out in a prefatory note 
to Menckeniana, "more than 500 separate editorials upon the sayings and doings 
of Mencken were printed in the United States, and at least four-fifths were 
unfavorable. Himself given to somewhat acidulous utterance, he has probably 
been denounced more vigorously and at greater length than any other American of 
his time, not even excepting Henry Ford, Robert M. LaFollette, Clarence Darrow, 
and Sacco and Vanzetti." 
</P>
<P>
From the vast amount of material, contained in 30 volumes of scrapbooks, 
Mencken and the future Mrs. Mencken, Sara Powell Haardt, made an "expurgated 
edition." According to the publisher, some were "chosen for their wit -- for 
there are palpable hits among them! -- and some for their blistering ferocity, 
and some for their charming idiocy." A few of these deserve to be remembered, 
to provide a context for readers of "The Diary of H. L. Mencken" and also for 
themselves, as examples of lively invective rarely found in our tamer days. 
</P>
<P>
Mencken was "a literary stink-pot," according to the Raleigh Times; "a tavern 
brawler, drunk on adjectives," (the Nashville Tennessean), and as "a scribbler 
plethoric and thinker vacuous," the Memphis Commercial Appeal concluded, "what 
he writes is bilge." 
</P>
<P>
These are just three of the appreciative comments about the man who is now 
chiefly remembered for his monumental work about the American language. He had 
few defenders even among intellectuals and literary types. The New Republic 
called him a "Cinderella with flat feet"; the Chicago Literary Times dubbed him 
a "Dionysus sitting on a piece of flypaper," and a magazine of the University 
of Mississippi writes about "the cynical, putrid-souled H. L. Mencken . . . 
wallowing in a self-created atmosphere of filthy literary stench. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Mencken himself rarely lowered himself to such direct ad hominem smears, 
content to attack whole classes of people, such as the unrelenting war he waged 
on the "booboisie" -- a term he applied not just to the bourgeoisie but to all 
humanity. During the famous "Monkey Trial" of 1925, he kept up a barrage of 
derision against the backwardness of the South. His gloating obituary of 
William Jennings Bryan, the fundamentalist demagogue who was chiefly 
responsible for bullying the state of Tennessee into prosecuting John Thomas 
Scopes for teaching evolution, certainly did not win Mencken any friends. 
</P>
<P>
"In the not very remote past," wrote Nannie H. Chestnutt in the Nashville 
Tennessean, "a wiggle in the mud got alive, and in the course of time, became 
maggot, gadfly, cockroach, wasp, tobacco worm, scorpion, bat, English sparrow, 
cow-bird, buzzard, polecat, hyena, jackal, monkey, jackass and eventually 
evolved Mencken." 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Inquirer called him a "stormy petrel of unbalanced mental 
potentialities," and Howard Hammond, writing to the St. Michaels Comet in 
Maryland, showed as little respect for Mencken as for the English language: 
"Disappointed, dishonest, distruthful, disgraceful, degraded, degenerate 
evolute of a species fifty-seven varieties lower than a turkey buzzard." 
</P>
<P>
The circus metaphor also was popular, and even big-city newspapers happily 
joined in the chorus. "When Mr. Mencken tries to be humorous," opined Percy A. 
Hutchison in the New York Times, "he has all the subtlety and grace of a trick 
elephant dancing on an inverted tub." 
</P>
<P>
From evolution, it was a short step down into the gutter of indiscriminate 
racist attacks. Mencken hailed from a prosperous Baltimore family of German 
descent. The Danville Register in Virginia associated his "patronymic with a 
sinister Hunnish sound," while the Los Angeles Times ventured that "Mr. Mencken 
is a typical Hun in his criticism." One paper accused him of being a "former 
subject of the Kaiser"; another called him "a British toady," and the Vancouver 
Sun told its readers that in his "veins runs unsullied the pure blood of 
Hungary." 
</P>
<P>
The St. Louis Mirror thundered that "as the pure blood will tell, the erstwhile 
Bright Boy of Baltimore has in time evolved into the super-Boche of our 
American culture . . . " Harold N. Coriell, in the New York Herald Tribune, 
thought Mencken "an offense in the nostrils of all Americans who love the 
ideals and best traditions of their country." Ditto the New Haven Union: 
"Mencken, obviously of foreign name, is a treacherous alien sapping at the 
vitals of America's proudest and most essential institutions, an indecent 
buffoon wallowing in obscenity as he howls with glee." 
</P>
<P>
Out of the empty West came this: The Montana American in Butte pictured 
Mencken, a continent away, as "a Jewish expert screwing the microscope into his 
jaundiced eye," and "shaking his head over all the jewels proffered in America 
by Americans." In the light of the few racist comments found in the diary, the 
following 1920s quotes are noteworthy: 
</P>
<P>
"We are not fully informed as to Mencken's color and race," editorialized the 
Tampa Tribune, "but his remarks about Negro superiority in the South lead us to 
believe that he must be a Negro by inclination if not by birth. He is, as a 
matter of fact, far inferior to the average Southern Negro." Arabella Jameson, 
in the Raleigh News and Observer, takes a different tack: "Away with the 
inhibition of inferiority this clever Hebrew would wish upon us!" 
</P>
<P>
No less a literary figure than Gilbert Keith Chesterton joined the lynch mob 
from England, managing to damn him and Americans in the same breath: "Mr. 
Mencken is a clever and bitter Jew, in whom a very real love of letters is 
everlastingly exasperated by the American love of cheap pathos and platitude." 
Even if Mencken had been Jewish, he would have found that community less than 
welcoming. "He appears to be a Jew of the 'dirty bird which fouls its own nest' 
variety," The American Israelite tried to analyze him, "probably acting in this 
manner to show that he is different and of finer clay than his fellows." 
</P>
<P>
Mencken hardly ever responded to this endless stream of abuse. He seemed to 
delight in it. His revenge was to make money from publishing Menckeniana. 
Almost 30 years after that, he finally did have something to say -- in private. 
His last seven years laid waste by a stroke, and welcome death approaching, 
Mencken's parting words to a visiting friend were: "Remember, write what you 
damn well please. But be sure to tell 'em I've always been a Christian. And a 
patriot." 
</P>
<P>
He died on Jan. 29, 1956. May he never rest in peace -- because he never wanted 
to.

PHOTOGRAPHY'S POST-BIRTHDAY BASH;

<P>
THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART WEIGHS IN WITH WHAT MAY BE THE FINAL WORD ON THE 
SESQUICENTENNIAL CELEBRATION

Photography celebrated its 150th birthday in 1989 with a year-long round of 
exhibitions. They went on and on, and traveled around the country until it 
seemed that photography was about the only art to be seen while 
sesquicentennial mania persisted. 
</P>
<P>
Major museums hosted massive surveys while smaller outposts gathered 
photographs under geographic or thematic mantles. American tourists in Europe 
soon discovered that the bonanza wasn't a national phenomenon. In London, the 
Royal Academy of Art imported "The Art of Photography: 1839-1989" from Houston 
while the Barbican Art Gallery offered "Through the Looking Glass: Photographic 
Art in Britain, 1945-1989"; Paris' Georges Pompidou Center booked an 
international survey while the auto racing city of Le Mans boasted a dozen 
shows of French photographers' work in schools and community centers. 
</P>
<P>
Now that we're well into 1990 and the party is over, the Museum of Modern Art 
has opened "Photography Until Now." The long-promised exhibition is a 
revisionist historical survey organized by John Szarkowski, director of the 
museum's department of photography. The show, sponsored by Springs Industries, 
Inc., will be at MOMA to April 29, then travel to the Cleveland Museum of Art, 
June 27 to Aug. 19. It will not come to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of "Photography Until Now" is problematic. It infuriates those who 
see it as a calculated move -- like a fashionably late entrance staged to prove 
superiority or avoid associating with the riff-raff. But it is also appropriate 
for MOMA to have the last word. 
</P>
<P>
The museum has a distinguished history of involvement with photography -- a 
distinction that few institutions can claim -- and Szarkowski has made MOMA the 
country's premier photography powerhouse during his 28-year tenure. He has, of 
course, been criticized for the way he wields that power, and his program often 
seems to lag well behind current thinking. At the same time, he is credited 
with discovering such unconventional talents as Lee Friedlander, Garry 
Winogrand and Diane Arbus, as well as organizing seminal exhibitions and 
writing blissfully readable essays. 
</P>
<P>
Given all that, it must be said that "Photography Until Now" is a predictable 
exercise for Szarkowski. It is as brilliant, revelatory and delightful as it is 
hidebound. Probably the best thing going for it is that the show feels like a 
real person with an idea is behind it. That comes as no small relief after a 
year of committee-organized photography surveys that contained wonderful images 
and provided broad perspectives, but sometimes seemed pointless. 
</P>
<P>
Szarkowski's point is that the art of photography can't or shouldn't be 
divorced from the technology that makes it possible. That doesn't sound like a 
big deal until you recall that photography's passionate search for acceptance 
as fine art has depended upon sweeping technology into the closet. What matters 
is the art, not how it's made, goes the argument. 
</P>
<P>
Szarkowski would probably agree while pointing out that photography is 
different from other art because the look of it is the result of (if not 
determined by) technical processes. 
</P>
<P>
This thesis holds up well in the early years of photography. When pioneering 
photographers had to transport entire darkrooms with them in order to prepare, 
expose and process wet plates quickly, for example, they could not operate 
spontaneously. However, the cumbersome process was "splendid for the 
disciplined, methodological description of every ancient monument in Egypt, or 
every locomotive built in Manchester," Szarkowski notes, and that's exactly the 
sort of picture that proliferated. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the 1880s that photographers were free to take chances and 
shoot pictures more or less as they found them. By then they were working with 
dry plates that could be prepared in advance and processed long after exposure. 
Once hand-held cameras and flexible film were developed it was probably 
inevitable that photographers such as Winogrand would shoot thousands of frames 
on the street to produce a few pictures. 
</P>
<P>
When you think about the art/technology partnership along these lines, it makes 
perfect sense to weave them together in an exhibition. "Photography Until Now" 
does that quite successfully for the first 100 years or so. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, when photographers were trying to figure out what to do with 
an invention that was not born of need, they quite naturally thought small and 
concentrated on the people around them. Daguerreotypes yielded wondrously 
detailed, one-of-a-kind likenesses and lent themselves to intimate 
investigations. A lovely group of portraits on metal, which seem to expose all 
the warts and wrinkles of unlovely people, launches the historical survey. 
</P>
<P>
Calotypes, on the other hand, produced softer, broader pictures that could be 
reproduced by means of paper negatives. This revolutionary development 
encouraged photographers to look outward -- at landscapes, architecture and 
subjects that might appeal to a wider audience and be disseminated among new 
customers. William Pumphrey, for example, photographed the Norman porch of a 
church in York, Henri-Victor Regnault pictured a cozy, cluttered view of the 
Sevres porcelain factory and Linneaus Tripe captured a columned corridor in 
India as if it were a one-point perspective drawing. 
</P>
<P>
The wet plate method, which produced negatives on glass instead of paper, 
combined the clarity of daguerreotypes with the reproducibility of calotypes. 
Despite its physical drawbacks, the process proved irresistible and took over 
in the mid-1850s. Francis Frith packed glass plates off to Egypt and came back 
with pictures of pyramids that remain archetypes. 
</P>
<P>
Other photographers worked with glass plates at home, staging dramatic scenes 
or simply recording appearances. Fallon Horne's "Youth and Age," for example, 
depicts a trembling boy under the spell of a weighty old sage. It's such a 
sappy bit of drama that it's lovable. An unknown photographer's stiff pictures 
of American workers, on the other hand, are touchingly revealing. 
</P>
<P>
As time went on, the useless invention of photography became increasingly 
functional, as we see in mug shots of prisoners (who look like solid citizens) 
and sequential pictures of human and animal locomotion. When technology became 
so advanced that it was controlled by laboratories, photography became even 
more useful -- and more expressive. 
</P>
<P>
Social reformers such as Lewis Hine could use it to argue for the rights of 
workers. Photographers who labored under the Works Progress Administration 
could produce soul-burning pictures of bread lines and migratory workers during 
the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
These artists' motives may have been mixed, and indeed some of their pictures 
invite contradictory readings. Dorothea Lange's close-up of a cotton picker 
wiping his mouth with the back of his hand depicts a young man pleading for 
relief even as his gesture suggests a desperate wish for privacy from the 
camera. Powerful as they are as social documents, her pictures are inevitably 
artworks. 
</P>
<P>
The invention of the halftone block, at the end of the 19th Century, made it 
possible to print photographs in ink and send them out to an ever-widening 
audience. Life and other picture magazines provided a vast market for 
photographers but dictated subject matter and eventually lost their vigor. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, photographic images mixed with text in advertising and art. 
The magazines' collage approach was paralleled by Surrealist Max Ernst and 
Russian Constructivist El Lissitzky, whose photographic self-portrait is a 
conceptually dense piece of work that overlays the artist's eye, hand and face 
with a grid, a drawing implement and typography. In one modest picture, he 
brings the history of artistic vision into the age of mechanical reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
And so it goes through dozens of fascinating examples, until we arrive at the 
troublesome '60s. 
</P>
<P>
This is hopelessly sticky territory because photography goes off on so many 
tangents and gets so mixed up with painting that it can't be adequately tracked 
in a historical summary. The other big surveys that have tried to deal with the 
explosion of contemporary photography have generally confused the issue or left 
gaping holes. 
</P>
<P>
"Photography Until Now" just fizzles out and looks distracted when it 
approaches "Now." The show pays dutiful homage to the colorful inventions of 
Andy Warhol (celebrity portraits reproduced by silk screen), Robert 
Rauschenberg (collages of found images printed on cloth), Cindy Sherman 
(chameleon-like self-portraiture), William Wegman (droll conceptual work 
featuring the artist's dog) and David Hockney (composite Cubist portraits). 
</P>
<P>
But these works appear as an aberration when the exhibition cycles back to 
recent black-and-white work that recalls much earlier photographs. Nicholas 
Nixon's picture of an emaciated man dying of AIDS, for example, might be an 
update of social criticism from the 1930s. Chris Killip's 1987 shot of a girl 
with a hula hoop has the wild, romantic tones of late 19th-Century landscape. 
The final photograph in the show, Judith Joy Ross' 1988 shot of adolescent 
girls in bathing suits, is wistfully reminiscent of daguerreotype portraits. 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean that photography has gone nowhere in 150 years? No, but it does 
lead viewers to conclude that technology can't explain contemporary 
photography.

STUDENT COURT: PRESSURE OF PEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN YAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a stiff sentence for the 9-year-old: He was ordered to copy three pages 
out of a dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
"I want a lawyer," the boy told the court sponsor, Rosemary Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
But she answered, "In the court system we have, lawyers are not allowed." 
</P>
<P>
The boy gave her a puzzled look. 
</P>
<P>
The prohibition against lawyers wasn't the only thing puzzling about this 
court. The three judges wore black robes cut from graduation gowns. The verdict 
has always been guilty. And the bailiff has been known to wear a Batman T-shirt 
while swearing in the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
It is the student court at Camellia Avenue School in North Hollywood, which has 
meted out guilty verdicts to about a dozen youngsters for "crimes" that have 
included lying to a teacher, ditching class and general misbehavior. The 
tribunal of judges is composed of the student council's 15 members, who take 
turns donning the judicial robes and deciding on their schoolmates' punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Cleaning the yard, writing apologies and copying definitions are the standard 
sentences, which the court calls "consequences" because they result from 
students' actions. Before pronouncing the consequence, the tribunal whispers 
the defendant's punishment to fourth-grade teacher Douglas, who provides an 
informal check on judicial powers. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Principal Shirley Gold, who started Camellia Court last November, 
said students facing peer judges know they can't get away with as much as they 
might be able to with adults. Gold thought of the court idea as a teacher 25 
years ago when she realized that the policy of slapping naughty students' palms 
with a ruler didn't work. But it wasn't until recently, when she read an 
article about a similar school court in Colorado, that she thought of the idea 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Cosetta Moore, the elementary social studies specialist for the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, said the court may be unique, but verifying that would 
be difficult because the district has about 400 elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Discipline is a really hard problem in school," she said. "We don't have gangs 
in our school. We have this gang mentality. We're finding our children will 
band together and intimidate a child: 'Me and my friends will get you after 
school.' When children are judged by their own peers -- on the right side of 
the law -- then other children don't see them as heroes." 
</P>
<P>
Gold and Douglas believe the court will help judges and defendants become 
better decision makers, forcing them to seriously consider the consequences of 
their actions. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I think I and other teachers shouldn't interfere in the judges' 
decisions," Douglas said. "It really teaches them they can be a part of what 
goes on in the world, not just be observers." 
</P>
<P>
Camellia Court, which is held in Douglas' classroom, is called into session 
Thursdays after school when there are one or two cases, usually 
teacher-referred. Standing behind the teacher's desk, the judges call on their 
training -- a videotaped episode of "People's Court," a visit to Van Nuys Small 
Claims Court and tips from a lawyer -- to ferret out the truth. 
</P>
<P>
And when they can't, well, they can sentence the plaintiff too. 
</P>
<P>
Recently the tribunal did that for the first time, in the case of a 
sixth-grader accused of striking an 11-year-old boy on the shoulder. The 
plaintiff had gone to the bathroom, where the sixth-grade defendant asked him, 
"What are you doing here?" 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't touch him. That isn't true at all, I swear," the sixth-grader 
testified. "He just said 'Shut up' and I didn't like it." 
</P>
<P>
Judge Angel Nava, 12, asked, "Why couldn't you tell a teacher?" 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiff was just as emphatic. "He hit me on the left shoulder," he 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
After the longest decision conference in the court's history -- five minutes -- 
Judge Nancy Quintanilla, 11, spoke for the tribunal: 
</P>
<P>
"We have decided the defendant will copy three pages of a dictionary -- both 
sides -- and the plaintiff will copy three pages of a dictionary. We have 
decided this because we don't know which one is telling the truth." 
</P>
<P>
There were no stern lectures from the judges, no pleas for the mercy of the 
court and no cries of "I object." The students and their witnesses went home. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt sort of nervous," Nancy, a fifth-grader, said after court adjourned. 
"We couldn't just blame one. If the other one was lying, that wouldn't be fair. 
We decided to give them three pages of dictionary. If we were going to give 
them a week of cleaning, they would say, 'This is too easy,' and they would do 
it again." 
</P>
<P>
But a clinical psychologist who helps children resolve emotional problems said 
sentencing both the plaintiff and defendant gives students the wrong message, 
one that might carry over into their adult lives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bad precedent to set. Anybody's going to hesitate before becoming a 
plaintiff," said Chaytor Mason, a USC professor who has studied courtroom 
reactions of juries, judges and witnesses. "We're giving the wrong message to 
kids by saying the judges can make mistakes and cannot arrive at a decision. 
When the judges couldn't decide who was guilty, they should have declared a 
mistrial." 
</P>
<P>
When children see the plaintiff is sentenced, they as adults may not report 
crimes, thinking "Why report? I'll probably get in trouble myself," Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the student court a case of "the blind leading the blind," Mason said 
he would rather see an adult, who has more experience, judge the students. He 
said mock trials, in which students play the roles of prosecutors, judges and 
defendants, are a better way of teaching youngsters how they can affect their 
futures -- without hurting egos or encouraging a sense of rejection. 
</P>
<P>
Gold, who was surprised by the sentence, agreed with many of Mason's criticisms 
but said: "I don't think this will happen again. It's a learning experience for 
students. They did the best with the information they had. We wouldn't do 
anything that would be detrimental to our children." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the hands-off philosophy of Douglas and Gold, adults have taken a more 
active role in this case. Douglas emphasized the concept of "innocent until 
proven guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt" to the student judges. But even after 
that, the teacher said, the youngsters -- three of the "most levelheaded kids" 
she has ever seen -- stuck to their verdict, saying they believed both boys may 
have been lying. 
</P>
<P>
A meeting has been scheduled with an attorney to tell the student judges -- 
along with the defendant and plaintiff -- what would have happened in a real 
court. At that time, the convicted boys will have to turn in their definitions. 
The educators said the boys have not complained about their sentence, but if 
they do, an appeals process will be open to them. 
</P>
<P>
Like their real-life counterparts, the young judges have found that 
administering justice is not always easy. 
</P>
<P>
"The plaintiff is in my class. I see him every day," said Becky Lupercio, 12, 
one of the judges in the case. "He's going to ask me, 'Why did you give me 
three pages to write?' We have to look them in the eye and don't smile or 
anything or they'll say, 'These are not real judges, they're playing.' " 
</P>
<P>
A number of school administrators and teachers have slipped in to watch the 
sessions, Douglas said, and those who miss sessions have inquired about cases. 
"They think it's a great experiment," she said.

HEART ATTACK KILLS MALCOLM FORBES AT 70

Malcolm Forbes, publisher of the business magazine that bears his name and one 
of the country's most colorful and outspoken millionaires, died of a heart 
attack in his sleep Saturday at his home, a spokesman for the magazine said. He 
was 70. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes was pronounced dead at 4:30 p.m. EDT at Timberfield, his home in Far 
Hills, N.J., said the spokesman, William Donald Garson, director of corporate 
communications for Forbes Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes had returned Saturday morning from a trip to London, Garson said. 
</P>
<P>
He died of natural causes, said Michael Schalet, the Somerset County medical 
examiner. 
</P>
<P>
The flamboyant magazine publisher, often seen with actress Elizabeth Taylor at 
his side, was known for his hot-air balloons, Harley Davidson motorcycles and 
extravagant parties. Forbes spent a reported $2 million on his 70th birthday 
party last year. 
</P>
<P>
He was proclaimed an honorary citizen of Tangier, Morocco, as that bash -- 
which included feast, seaside fireworks and nightlong dancing -- drew to a 
close Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly 1,000 guests featured some of the top names in business, industry, 
entertainment and the arts: billionaire Donald Trump, Fiat Chairman Giovanni 
Agnelli, opera singer Beverly Sills, television personalities Walter Cronkite 
and Barbara Walters, Spanish singer Julio Iglesias, publishers Katharine 
Graham, Rupert Murdoch and Robert Maxwell, former Secretary of State Henry A. 
Kissinger, and former Kings Constantine of Greece and Simeon of Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
They were feasted in Moroccan-style tents to pigeon pie, lamb mechoui and 
chicken tadjine. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes' worth was estimated by various sources at $400 million to $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
He appeared in the celebrity columns of newspapers as often as on the business 
pages, frequently in connection with a motorcycle ride or balloon flight. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor had been his frequent companion since his 39-year marriage ended in 
divorce in 1985.

<P>
UCSD THRIVES UNDER CHANCELLOR'S STEADY FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Richard T. Atkinson visited the UC San Diego campus for the first time in 
March, 1980, he already knew of the remarkable collection of professors 
assembled at the young institution, less than 16 years old at the time but 
already ranked as the best among universities created after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson took little time as the fifth and newest UCSD chancellor to proclaim 
his priority to be one of preserving academic quality. 
</P>
<P>
After initial discussions with faculty, students and staff, there was 
near-unanimous praise for his stellar academic credentials as a leading 
psychologist at Stanford University, his managerial talent honed as head of the 
National Science Foundation, and his charm and willingness to listen, debate 
and make himself accessible to both the campus and the community. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after a decade of prodigious growth and expansion at the campus, Atkinson 
-- the longest-serving chancellor at UCSD -- says his actions, from new 
programs to new buildings, all stem from his original and still top priority to 
enhance faculty quality. 
</P>
<P>
And the university community -- indeed, the San Diego community at large -- 
continues to speak overwhelmingly of his energy, his intellectual interests and 
his ability to deflect animosities and disputes that otherwise would combine 
over a decade to diminish a chancellor's effectiveness. Among the many changes: 
</P>
<P>
* The number of full-time faculty members jumped 41%, from 753 to 1,061. The 
number of faculty chairs endowed by local individuals or corporations grew from 
zero to 31. Enrollment climbed from 11,183 students to 17,595. 
</P>
<P>
For entering classes, composite Scholastic Aptitude Test scores rose from 1059 
to 1138 and high-school grade point averages from 3.45 to 3.74. 
</P>
<P>
* The university created a division of engineering, a department of 
communications, centers for research in magnetic recording and in molecular 
genetics, and institutes for research on aging and on global conflict. It 
established graduate schools in Pacific Rim studies and in architecture, the 
nation's largest earthquake structural testing laboratory, a national 
supercomputer center and a U.S.-Mexican studies program, and expanded its 
medical school to include strong clinical ties to the community. 
</P>
<P>
* UCSD was named to membership in the Assn. of American Universities, a group 
of the top 58 research institutions. The faculty won many academic awards, 
including six MacArthur prizes (which reward uncommon talent with money for 
research), three National Medal of Science awards, eight Presidential Young 
Investigator awards and two Pulitzer Prizes. Federal research funding zoomed 
from $115 million in 1980 to $171 million in 1990, making UCSD fifth among all 
American universities in receipt of federal grant money. 
</P>
<P>
* Construction totaling almost half a billion dollars radically altered the 
look of the campus, with new buildings for engineering, for medicine, for 
undergraduate classrooms, for undergraduate dormitories, for performing arts 
with the Mandell Weiss Center and the La Jolla Playhouse, and for student life 
with the sprawling Price Center. 
</P>
<P>
* With a monthly payroll of $30 million to 15,000 employees and annual 
purchases of $300 million in goods and services, economists estimate that UCSD 
contributed almost $1 billion a year to San Diego's economy by 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson's "great, and I've taught under a lot of great college presidents, 
from Dwight Eisenhower and Nicholas Butler at Columbia to Robert Sproul and 
Clark Kerr at Berkeley," said William Nierenberg, the iconoclastic 
director-emeritus of UCSD's Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 
</P>
<P>
"He exercises authority in a very gentle way, which I could never do, because 
he will tolerate a certain amount of inefficiency, here and there, for the 
greater goal of the overall campus. 
</P>
<P>
"And he's a fabulous fund-raiser -- again in an easy, gentle way -- and things 
have gotten built on this campus in a way that I would have never guessed in 
100 years." 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's first chancellor in 1960, physicist Herbert York, calls Atkinson an 
"academic entrepreneur" with the ability to spot promising new areas and 
programs, who took an already good university to even higher levels.

"Atkinson certainly has created the general atmosphere" for advancement, York 
said, although noting that "the growth and quality on a campus involve more 
than just a single person, whether a chancellor or anyone else. As chancellor, 
you don't have a lot of room to intervene in established departments," given 
the strong tradition of faculty governance in the University of California 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"But, in devising new units or recruiting new people, you can play a big role 
and steer resources," York added, agreeing with the Pacific Rim school's dean, 
Peter Gourevich, who said that Atkinson "is the type of person who at the right 
moment says, 'Yes,' really strongly, and pounces like a lion on the 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
R. Barry McComic, the developer of Rancho Bernardo in the early 1960s, said 
Atkinson "has a fantastic enthusiasm for the university that is infectious." 
</P>
<P>
McComic is one of 500 members of the Chancellor's Associates -- up from about 
80 when Atkinson first arrived -- who donate $1,500 annually into a 
discretionary fund to support special UCSD projects. In addition, McComic has 
helped shepherd the UCSD Foundation from $4 million in 1980 to its present 
$52-million endowment, which contributes almost $9 million a year to the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
"If you stay around Dick long enough," McComic said, "you begin to hear 
yourself spouting the statistics and talking about professors that he is 
continually telling people about, and you begin repeating them to other people 
. . . the place is absolutely full of excitement and has the brightest and the 
most talented and most motivated people around San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson professes reluctance to take the major credit for UCSD's progress, 
reflecting a cautious public stance built up over years of political battles, 
both in Washington as NSF director and in academia, as well as his gentlemanly 
sense of style that dictates letting accomplishments speak for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything good from this university flows from the faculty, and they set the 
whole climate," the 60-year-old chancellor said. "I understand the importance 
of having a first-rank faculty fully engaged in academic pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
"So I am aggressive in interactions and do have conflicts over issues, but I go 
out of my way to maintain good relations, to avoid personal animosities, even 
with those whom I am at odds with on intellectual issues." 
</P>
<P>
David Gardner, president of the UC system, said Atkinson's "impeccable academic 
credentials and his years of teaching and research all prepared him for a 
campus that has high expectations and exacting standards for itself . . . a 
faculty that is both proud and insistent on its own prerogatives." 
</P>
<P>
"The fit is just right between UC San Diego and Dick Atkinson," Gardner said, 
adding that UCSD now ranks among the top 25 universities nationally, along with 
UC Berkeley and UCLA, and enjoys an international reputation in many areas, 
both science and non-science. 
</P>
<P>
The founding father of UCSD, oceanographer Roger Revelle, said Atkinson "is not 
in any way someone who rubs people the wrong way. He genuinely has a sweet 
disposition." 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson was keenly aware in 1980 when named chancellor that his predecessor, 
William D. McElroy, had resigned in part from conflict with the Academic 
Senate, which had voted a no-confidence resolution concerning his 
administrative policies. 
</P>
<P>
"But, even after 10 years, he is still sensitive to the need for shared 
governance with the faculty" and the need for avoiding big surprises, said 
Katja Lindenberg, a chemical physicist and former chair of the Academic Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Lindenberg said that Atkinson always consults before pushing a particular 
course of action, such as creating the division of engineering in 1982 and 
pushing continued enrollment in the early 1980s despite inadequate state 
funding until Gov. Deukmejian began increasing UC budgets. Concurrence of the 
senate is required before the university can carry out new curriculum or 
academic programs. 
</P>
<P>
"He loves hearing what you have to say, to have open argument, . . . I miss the 
debating matches that I used to have with him" as faculty senate chair, said 
Lindenberg, a UCSD professor for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Dick is intellectually engaged in what the faculty is doing, he likes to know 
what they are doing and what kinds of things they are interested in," said 
Patrick Ledden, provost of Muir College, one of five undergraduate campus 
residential units. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Theodore Groves, the present chair of the Academic Senate, recalled 
the annual dinner last month at UCLA, at which chancellors from all nine 
campuses and their major assistants dine together. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking with one of my colleagues (about some research on Benjamin 
Franklin) and Dick overheard what was being said and immediately joined us," 
Groves said, "talking about Franklin's science interest and how he (Atkinson) 
had become familiar with it while planning a Bicentennial proposal regarding 
Franklin when he was head of the National Science Foundation. . . . He's not 
just a public relations person like so many chancellors." 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson also takes on greater responsibility for recruiting faculty members 
than do many chancellors, said Roy Ritchie, UCSD history professor who also 
serves as an associate chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a key recruitment or even a retention issue, Dick is willing to 
get into the thing and help in any way he can," Ritchie said. 
</P>
<P>
Gourevich of the Pacific Rim school said Atkinson gave vital credibility to 
Gourevich's efforts in 1986 and 1987 to recruit prominent professors from 
across the nation for the new graduate school. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just chairman of a steering committee at the time," Gourevich said. 
"Atkinson was able to reassure people like (Laurence Krause from the Brookings 
Institution in Washington) that UC was committed to the concept, that the 
school was really important to the campus." 
</P>
<P>
"He was very persuasive with me," Ramon Gutierrez, professor of history, said 
of Atkinson's role in UCSD's recruitment of him from Pomona College in 1982. 
Gutierrez received a MacArthur Prize in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, I had a variety of offers from other schools, and I remember my 
apprehension about coming to La Jolla because of the cost of housing and the 
whole issue of the University of California paying less than private 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
"Atkinson went out of his way to invite me to campus, to make sure that housing 
was available to me, to talk to me about salary and incentives." 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson said: "I think it makes a difference that I am interested, and I do 
have a lot of intellectual interest, and a lot of connections through the 
international scene." 
</P>
<P>
But he confessed some surprise at the growth in the faculty over the past 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Even I never expected it would climb from some 700 to almost 1,200, but that 
shows why private funding and endowment support is so important," Atkinson 
said, referring to his community fund raising. For UC-endowed chairs, a minimum 
$250,000 donation is required, to cover research and other activities not paid 
by the basic state-funded salary. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, Atkinson has been wildly successful in deepening UCSD's roots 
within the community and in particular in nurturing the region's growing 
biomedical and high-technology firms through outreach programs with the 
university's high-powered science and medical departments. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD faculty members are responsible for the formation of 35 biotechnology 
firms in San Diego County, according to university records. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any chancellor who has better relations with the surrounding 
community than Dick has," UC President Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Pegg, head of the Economic Development Corp. in San Diego, a city-sponsored 
agency to attract business to San Diego, said few residents realize "the 
involvement that UCSD has had in the major diversification of San Diego's 
economy . . . a great deal of our high-tech manufacturing and biomed could not 
have happened without the university, and Atkinson has made it a high priority 
to listen to any concept or proposal and look for reasons to say 'yes' in 
helping the community." 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson said the results stem from good timing, "in that we sort of hit our 
stride (in the decade) just as the region did . . . it's a synergetic 
activity." 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San Diego), who earned her doctorate in Latin 
American history at UCSD, said a great deal of Atkinson's success with the 
community comes "because he is one of the easiest people to talk to. He knows 
how to listen, which is unusual for someone who has the position he has, which 
involves so much speaking and telling other people his views. 
</P>
<P>
"He's even helped get the alumni association going." 
</P>
<P>
There have been a few disappointments for Atkinson, of course. His attempts to 
establish a law school in the early 1980s met with opposition from the Board of 
Regents and the state Legislature, although he still believes that a law school 
will one day be inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Minority hiring still lags behind goals, although Atkinson devised a systemwide 
program called "targets of opportunity," under which a department is given 
permission to hire a promising minority scholar, even if student enrollments do 
not justify an additional faculty appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Academic Senate remains uncomfortable with proposals for a department 
of ethnic studies. Atkinson has designated Gutierrez to head a special 
committee to come up with plans as well as to improve the often uneasy 
relationships between the existing interdisciplinary programs in particular 
fields -- such as ethnic studies, science studies and Asian studies -- and 
individual academic departments. 
</P>
<P>
But Groves pointed to the ethnic studies controversy as an example of 
Atkinson's collegial management style. 
</P>
<P>
"We've struggled with this and some people, quite frankly, would have breathed 
a sigh of relief if Atkinson had just let the issue die, but he feels we really 
need to have a commitment here, that there are changing demands on the 
university and a changing intellectual climate," Groves said. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson's most stressful time as chancellor came in 1982 and involved not a 
university-related crisis but a personal one. He was sued by a former assistant 
professor of education at Harvard University, who claimed that Atkinson 
impregnated her in 1977 and then persuaded her to have an abortion by falsely 
promising to father a child by her later. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson consistently denied the allegations, but in February, 1986, he agreed 
to pay Lee Perry $250,000 to settle her claims. She had charged that Atkinson 
caused her emotional distress by threatening to destroy her academic reputation 
and suggesting at one point that she commit suicide to resolve the mental 
distress caused by his failure to impregnate her a second time. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson said the settlement was not an admission of liability, but he and his 
wife wanted to bring the matter to a close and avoid the expense and 
uncertainty of further legal proceedings. He has subsequently declined to 
discuss the lawsuit, saying it is a legal matter about which he has been 
advised not to comment. 
</P>
<P>
A veteran UCSD official, who asked not to be identified, said the campus 
community "was remarkably sympathetic and understanding, and did not feel what 
happened was important at all for what the campus is about. 
</P>
<P>
"While I am sure he was under a fantastic strain, he was able to keep it quite 
separate from his duties as chancellor, and he showed it is possible to 
separate your personal life from a productive career during a time of crisis." 
</P>
<P>
However, some professors believe it might have negatively affected Atkinson's 
consideration as a replacement for former UC President David Saxon, who left 
the post in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Atkinson says he has no interest in leaving UCSD for any other job. "I 
like it here, and I plan to be around a lot longer," he said, although he must 
retire by age 67 under UC regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the urge to go anywhere else," Atkinson said, although he 
conceded that in the past he might have considered some foundation posts if 
offered, in particular with the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, press reports from San Francisco named him as Gardner's 
first choice to assume the chancellor's post at Berkeley. Gardner denied he had 
targeted Atkinson. The UCSD chancellor, although saying, "It was obvious my 
name was among many put into consideration," added, "I never asked to be 
considered." 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson has just completed a yearlong term as president of the prestigious 
American Assn. for the Advancement of Science, where he consistently sounded 
the warning about a growing lack of American scientists and engineers being 
trained to maintain the nation's competitiveness into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson will take a two-month leave of absence in April and May to lobby in 
Washington with congressional leaders and other policy-makers for greater 
national resources to train more scientists and engineers, including 
establishment of a National Fellowship Program to award 3,000 new four-year 
fellowships annually to doctoral candidates in science. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his priorities at UCSD upon his return, Atkinson again hearkened 
back to the theme he began with in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"Faculty excellence, faculty quality," he said. "All the other things that I 
do, from a new school to whatever, will all be within that overall framework." 
</P>

NATIONAL CITY, BENT ON TOURIST DOLLAR, BALKS AT DOCK PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: SITE THAT PORT DISTRICT HAS TICKETED FOR UNLOADING OF IMPORTED 
CARS IS COVETED BY THE CITY FOR HOTELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Looking at the Mile of Cars, with endless rows of new automobiles, it seems 
that National City officials have never seen a car they did not like. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, is the City Council fuming over a decision by the Port District to 
allow thousands of foreign cars to be unloaded at the National City 24th Street 
Pier? 
</P>
<P>
"For one thing, the city isn't getting one penny from the tariffs that the port 
will generate," said National City Councilman Fred Pruitt. "But our biggest 
complaint is that the port is taking away property that would give us access to 
the bay. They're dumping the projects that San Diego doesn't want on our 
doorstep." 
</P>
<P>
It is no secret that San Diego wants to get rid of the cargo-handling 
facilities on its waterfront so it can proceed with the conversion of its 
shoreline to the tourist industry and businesses, Pruitt added. 
</P>
<P>
"After years of redeveloping our downtown and commercial areas, we're ready to 
turn our attention to our waterfront," he said. "But now, the port has decided 
to allow a facility that will handle thousands of imported cars for the next 10 
years on property where we envisioned putting four hotels and building our 
tourist industry." 
</P>
<P>
Pruitt's fear that the property may be unavailable for 10 years might prove too 
optimistic. Delton (Rip) Reopelle, National City's representative to the Port 
District, said the agreement signed by the port with the company that will 
process the imported cars includes a five-year option that could stretch the 
contract to 15 years. The National City Council had asked the Port to limit the 
contract to five years. 
</P>
<P>
But National City also is working -- with some success -- on turning the 
objectionable move into an opportunity. As a result of the city's objections to 
the car facility, The Board of Port Commissioners agreed earlier this month to 
consider a proposal by the City Council to develop a larger site south of the 
24th Street Pier that lies roughly between 32nd Street and the mouth of the 
Sweetwater River. Mayor George Waters has been aggressive in pushing plans for 
a "Seaport Village-type" tourist attraction with shops and restaurants 
overlooking the water, anchored by a marina, for that particular area. 
</P>
<P>
Port District spokesman Dan Wilkins said the marina is "under active 
implementation" and in the beginning phase of development. He said the project 
is undergoing an environmental study. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy surfaced last month, when the port reached an agreement with 
the Pasha Group that will allow the Bay Area-based company to process a minimum 
of 50,000 imported cars a year at the 24th Street Pier. Port officials agreed 
to make 35 acres available to the company, but the contract includes a 
provision for possible expansion. In return, the port will receive a $15 tariff 
per vehicle and 50 cents per day, per car, for storage. 
</P>
<P>
Although the agreement calls for a minimum of 50,000 vehicles to go through 
annually, Port District officials said they expect about 70,000 cars to be 
unloaded at National City each year. The terminal should generate $1 million to 
$1.4 million in revenue a year, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Pasha also operates facilities in Long Beach and Richmond, Calif., and in 
Philadelphia. Senior Vice President Jim Hull said the company handles 180,000 
imports a year in Long Beach, 150,000 in Richmond and 20,000 in Philadelphia. 
It pays a tariff of $24 per car in Long Beach, $18 in Richmond and $8 in 
Philadelphia, said Hull. 
</P>
<P>
Cars processed in San Diego will be shipped by train to the East Coast and 
points in between, in addition to Southern California, Hull said. In order to 
ship cars by railroad, Santa Fe Railroad will have to lay a spur to connect the 
pier to the main track line, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Although the agreement was signed, Hull and Reopelle said an environmental 
obstacle still has to be overcome. Despite a provision that requires Pasha to 
begin operating by next January, neither side knows when the first cars will be 
unloaded, because the Port has been ordered to clean the site of pollution 
caused by copper concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
"The 10-year underlined agreement cannot be exercised until the port takes care 
of some environmental concerns," Hull said. "Assuming that the environmental 
concerns are addressed, we're in." 
</P>
<P>
Reopelle said that copper contamination around the pier has "presented some 
concern." Until a few years ago, an Arizona company used the 24th Street Pier 
to ship copper sulfate to Asia. The shipments were stopped when the Regional 
Water Quality Control Board found that the copper had polluted the bay and 
nearby area, and ordered a cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"There appears to be some concern about the copper residue on the ground, as 
well as on the buildings and at the bottom of the bay. The degree of the action 
that the Port has to take hasn't been spelled out. We have consultants working 
on the issue," said Reopelle. 
</P>
<P>
The Port District has jurisdiction over tidelands in the cities of San Diego, 
National City, Chula Vista, Coronado and Imperial Beach. The seven port 
commissioners -- three from San Diego and one from each of the other four 
cities -- have the final say on all waterfront projects in the Port District's 
jurisdiction. The Pasha agreement was approved unanimously, with Reopelle 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
Reopelle and Pasha officials acknowledged that National City opposes the 
company's plans to use the 24th Street Pier. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that they have an interest in recreational development in the area," 
Hull said. "We were obviously aware of the peripheral issues, but we cut the 
deal with the port. We decided to let the port handle whatever peripheral 
issues are out there." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Pasha's sincerity in opening a local car import terminal was 
questioned by port officials. Many observers believed that Pasha used the 
threat of moving to San Diego to gain leverage and negotiate a better deal with 
the Port of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hull said, America's appetite for imported cars has led to crowding at 
its Long Beach facility, forcing Pasha to expand. 
</P>
<P>
Reopelle said the port thinks Pasha wants to do business here. 
</P>
<P>
"We think they're sincere this time," said Reopelle. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hull, once the unloading operation is in place, the company will 
hire about 200 employees, and ships are expected to dock at the pier about two 
or three times a week. About 50 longshoremen are also expected to be hired to 
drive the cars off the ships. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a compromise is being worked out between National City officials and 
the Port District that could make it possible for National City to go ahead 
with a scaled-down version of its waterfront redevelopment plans. Port approval 
for National City's proposal may come next month, when port commissioners are 
expected to approve a City Council request to rezone about 112 bayfront acres 
from cargo to tourist and commercial. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, tourist-oriented developments have been in San Diego. It's time 
we start looking at the South Bay," Reopelle said. "When National City 
developed its master plan, its bayfront was zoned cargo-marine acreage. It's 
time to change that and give National City access to the bay. I think that will 
provide them with an opportunity to increase tourism in the area." 
</P>
<P>
The bay site slated for redevelopment by National City lies south of the 24th 
Street Pier. However, Pruitt and the National City Council still have their 
eyes on the 35 acres that the port has leased to Pasha. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to put those four hotels on that site, which should rightfully be 
ours. The port has taken the cream of the pie away from us. If you can imagine 
the hotels that could be built there, with the tremendous view of the bay and 
easy access to Interstate 5 and Harbor Drive, it's unbelievable," said Pruitt. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the site is less than 10 minutes from the San Diego Convention Center 
and closer to Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
"We're better situated than Mission Valley. Why doesn't the port see this 
potential?" said Pruitt, who quickly answered his own question. 
</P>
<P>
"It's because San Diego doesn't want them to see this potential. They know that 
putting four hotels on that site will drain Mission Valley's hotels. Who would 
ever see the day when we in National City would become a threat to San Diego's 
tourist industry?" 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Wilkins declined to comment on Pruitt's charges, saying instead that 
"we've negotiated with Pasha for two years." He added that National City 
officials were aware of the negotiations.

OFF THE RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An article in Anthony Perry's "San Diego at Large" column Feb. 9 seems a 
blatant violation of journalistic ethics. In his column, Perry notes that San 
Diego Gas &amp; Electric President Tom Page met in an "off-the-record" 
conversation with several reporters, and then goes on to describe the content 
of Page's conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Perry reports that "privately or publicly, Page does not deviate from the 
company line," and then states that Page's "beleaguered body language and 
verbal tics seemed to be saying something different." 
</P>
<P>
I am amazed that The Times, certainly a reputable journalistic organ, would 
print such information. It is a common journalistic practice that comments 
during an off-the-record conversation may not be printed under any 
circumstances. It would seem that facetious references to "body language" or 
even "verbal tics" would be also unprintable. 
</P>
<P>
As a reporter, I often encounter hesitancy and distrust from sources who have 
been burned by unethical or careless journalists in the past. The Times should 
be the last newspaper to perpetuate such distrust.

NOISE POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three cheers for your editorial Feb. 4, "Off-Roaders Don't Belong in 
Anza-Borrego Desert." 
</P>
<P>
You failed to mention, however, one more good reason why off-roaders should be 
kept out of the state park: noise pollution. 
</P>
<P>
I travel the back roads of Anza-Borrego by mountain bike, and I wander in the 
back country on foot. One of my primary rewards is the peace and quiet and 
solitude which the desert offers, and which is easily destroyed by the whine of 
an all-terrain vehicle. Let the stimulation junkies get their adrenaline highs 
on their noisy vehicles, but please, not in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. 
That is not why the park is there.

LEGALIZE DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anti-drug war crusaders and libertarians collected more ammunition in the pages 
of The Times on Feb. 13. First, California Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas 
called attention to the fact that drug cases are "swamping the courts," pushing 
aside important civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
Then the San Diego local section graphically revealed, in picture and word, 
what happens when narcotics officers raid the wrong house: splintered doors, 
broken furniture and terrified citizens, innocent of any wrong-doing. 
Significantly, though, they will reimburse damages, they never apologize. 
Apparently, they're just doing their jobs, no apologies necessary. 
</P>
<P>
It won't take much more of this to turn a few more minds toward the common 
sense solution: Legalize drugs and let the courts handle the civil cases, let 
the police chase real criminals, and let ordinary citizens rest secure that 
their doors will not be bashed in by the drug police.

ENVIRONMENTALISM: THE CONCEPT HAS GAINED ACCEPTANCE, BUT THE RESULTING 
BUREAUCRACY HAS FOUND MORE AND BETTER WAYS TO MASK INACTION.

<P>
To be an environmentalist today takes less effort or conviction than it did 20 
years ago. In the 1960s and '70s, those who ventured to publicly voice their 
opinions about preserving the environment were branded "tree-huggers" or 
"earth-firsters." A person who wanted to protect natural surroundings instead 
of develop them encountered a certain derision. 
</P>
<P>
Today, with sewage spills, deteriorating air quality and landfills that can no 
longer accommodate our waste, the environment is a matter of great importance 
and concern to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps nowhere is environmentalism more evident here than in the politics of 
growth and development. The question of whether development is environmentally 
sensitive is a pivotal consideration in the determination as to how and where 
growth will occur. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it would be difficult today to find a San Diegan who would claim not to 
be an environmentalist. 
</P>
<P>
But the increased popularity of environmentalism has not necessarily meant 
better environmental policies. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, the word "environmentalist" did not appear in Webster's dictionary. 
"Environment," however, was listed and defined as the "complex of climatic, 
edaphic (relating to soil), and biotic factors that act upon an organism or an 
ecological community and ultimately determine its form and survival." 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1980s, "environmentalist" appeared in the dictionary as "a person 
who seeks to protect the natural environment." But "environment" was defined 
simply as "surroundings." No mention of "organic" or any relation to "ecology," 
and certainly nothing about survival. 
</P>
<P>
One could conclude that in those 20 years our concept of the environment was 
simplified while the number of people concerned about that concept increased. 
At least enough of a numerical increase to justify a mention in the dictionary. 
Or to put it a little less subtly, more and more of us became concerned about 
less and less. 
</P>
<P>
Today many people consider themselves environmentalists if they have paid their 
annual dues to an appropriate environmental organization. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, President Nixon could be said to have made the entire federal 
government "environmentalists" when he established the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency. With the passage of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act 
and a few other pieces of federal legislation, the members of Congress also 
became environmentalists. In his 1988 presidential campaign, George Bush 
surprised the Democrats by declaring himself an environmentalist. And a Gallup 
poll recently found that 76% of all Americans now consider themselves 
environmentalists as well. 
</P>
<P>
Who are these people and what are they doing to claim the label 
"environmentalist?" Does voting in favor of certain legislation make our 
elected officials environmentalists? Certainly the politicians argue that it 
does. 
</P>
<P>
What does that label mean in the complexities of politics today? When George 
Bush claims to be an environmentalist but his Administration attempts to block 
a worldwide conference on air pollution, has the label become meaningless? 
</P>
<P>
In today's political vernacular "environmentalism" has evolved into a 
simplified administrative concept. Ecology and survival have not only 
disappeared from the definition in the dictionary, but from the political 
reality of environmentalism as well. In their place, administrative criteria 
have been substituted. 
</P>
<P>
Today, if a government form is completed correctly, you have done your 
environmental duty. As long as a business meets the government- mandated level 
of compliance, it is being environmentally sensitive. It does not matter that 
those mandated levels are wholly inadequate or that for certain hazardous 
substances, no standards have been set. 
</P>
<P>
And what happens if a business does not fill out the appropriate government 
form? It is fined. The EPA calls it a "consent decree." The California Water 
Resources Control Board issues a "clean-up and abatement order." These 
enforcement tools do three things: They publicly slap the company on the hand, 
they require the company to pay the government a certain amount of money, and 
they usually request the company to clean up its mess. 
</P>
<P>
This method of administrative environmentalism stops the gas station down the 
street from pouring used oil in the sewer; it often even puts them out of 
business. But for Exxon or Union Carbide, they simply pay the fine, relocate 
the contaminant, and hire a public relations firm to clean up their image (not 
the mess). It is the new cost of doing business in the world of administrative 
environmentalism. 
</P>
<P>
Or take, for example, clean air. There was concern last year because many U.S. 
communities, including San Diego, recorded dramatic increases in the number of 
times the air quality failed to meet federal standards. Instead of working on 
reducing the number of days where communities are out of compliance, the EPA 
created an administrative category of "non-attainment" areas. In these areas, 
being out of compliance with clean-air regulations for 20 or 30 days is now 
acceptable. By changing the administrative classification, these areas can now 
meet the (reduced) standards if their air is unhealthy 20 or 30 days a year. 
</P>
<P>
Administrative environmentalism runs rampant in the area of toxic materials. 
Scientists working for the state of California recently recommended a ban on a 
widely used pesticide because they found it highly toxic. The state Department 
of Food and Agriculture decided that a ban would harm farmers' economic 
interests, so they created a regulation to allow them to use it only during 
certain times of year and at a reduced level. 
</P>
<P>
After all, EPA Administrator William Reilly stated recently that the government 
needs risk standards that are "flexible." And Agriculture Secretary Clayton 
Yeutter added that such standards could not be strengthened because they must 
be "uniform." So what administrative environmentalism calls for are regulations 
that are uniform and flexible at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
This brand of "environmentalism" seems to have placated the concerns of the new 
"environmentalists." And politicians are learning that "environmentalism" is a 
necessary buzzword to be elected. 
</P>
<P>
But administrative environmentalism masks inaction with rhetoric. And for the 
past 20 years, as people have called for the restoration of the environment, 
the politicians and bureaucrats have, through administrative environmentalism, 
allowed its degradation. 
</P>
<P>
The time has come for everyone to end this environmental charade, or in the 
next 20 years, there will be plenty of excuses but little environment left to 
protect.

REFLECTIONS: 'I LIKE TO SUPPORT PEOPLE IN THEIR DECISION TO CHANGE AND CREATE 
HEALTH FOR THEMSELVES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

When Loretta Covert had surgery a few years ago and wasn't recovering quickly, 
a friend suggested that she see a faith healer. She thought, why not? That 
visit changed her life. Abandoning her studies in horticulture, Covert began 
exploring metaphysics, spirituality and traditional Chinese medicine. She 
attended the Kairos Institute in Encinitas and is a graduate of the California 
Acupuncture College. Now, the 36-year-old North Park resident offers an 
acupuncture/massage service at the Park Blvd. Health Center. Using 
strategically placed needles, massage and meditation, Covert treats people 
afflicted with everything from insomnia to infertility. Times staff writer 
Caroline Lemke interviewed Covert, and Theresa Tamura photographed her. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I was working for a company taking care of indoor plants when I became ill. I 
had had some surgery, and I wasn't healing, I wasn't gaining my strength back. 
One of my fellow workers took me to see a faith healer who had helped him a lot 
with his back pain. 
</P>
<P>
It was a totally unexpected experience. The faith healer was this Filipino man. 
I went in, laid down on the table, and he put his hand over my scar and said, 
"What happened here?" I had not told him anything, and I felt this incredible 
rush of energy move through me. I knew that this man knew God. 
</P>
<P>
That's basically what began my whole search into where I am now, into healing 
as a science and an art. I became interested in what faith healing was, and I 
started studying not so much religion, but spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
It was while I was at the Kairos Institute that I realized horticulture wasn't 
really my life work. 
</P>
<P>
The reason I did the massage was to find out if I really wanted to work with 
people. I found I liked massage, and I was good at it, and from there I 
immediately went into acupuncture school, which is almost a four-year process. 
</P>
<P>
Most people think that you just go take a class in acupuncture and you learn 
how to put a needle in. But acupuncture is just a small portion of what 
traditional Chinese medicine is. It's much more than putting needles in. You 
really need to be able to diagnose a person. 
</P>
<P>
Acupuncture is looking at the body as an energetic system and that each part of 
the body, each organ, has a specific energetic function. The traditional 
Chinese medicine doctor makes an evaluation or diagnosis much like a Western 
medical doctor does. It's done through observation, listening not only to what 
the patient tells, but what they aren't telling you. When someone comes in with 
a complaint, you utilize all the skills you have. 
</P>
<P>
I find very often that people have no idea about their bodies. We spend a lot 
of time out of our bodies, so to speak. We're such a mental society that we 
don't really know what it is to stop and sit and be with ourselves. We spend a 
lot of time trying to get out of it. 
</P>
<P>
All modalities of healing are relevant. Some people may need to go see an 
acupuncturist and that takes care of it. And some people need to go see a 
medical doctor and some may need to see a chiropractor. If I see that a patient 
of mine needs something different, I will refer them to a medical doctor, or a 
chiropractor or an osteopath. 
</P>
<P>
We need the medical Establishment. If I get my bones broken, take me to a 
hospital. I will go see an acupuncturist afterward to facilitate the healing 
process. 
</P>
<P>
I feel that my role as an acupuncturist or a healer is to support people in 
understanding their own ability to heal themselves and take responsibility for 
that. I like to support people in their decision to change and create health 
for themselves. It's difficult because you have to be willing to make some 
changes in life style, and sometimes in beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, every patient who comes to me, I learn a great deal about 
acupuncture, about healing and what my role is, about myself, about people in 
general. We're all here to basically learn from one another and assist one 
another, whatever our process.

'NO' ON CURTIS RECALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barely 2 years old, Mission Viejo is one of Orange County's newest cities. 
Politically, its residents are inexperienced, perhaps even naive. But there is 
something cunning and bothersome about the recall election that, thankfully, 
concludes with Tuesday's vote. 
</P>
<P>
It is, first of all, a clear misuse of the recall process, which ought to be 
reserved for officeholders who are accused of malfeasance. Nothing of the sort 
is claimed in this instance. The target of the recall, Councilman Robert A. 
Curtis, is accused of wasting the city's time and resources on his own agenda, 
of lying and of playing political games. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis has a reputation for being pesky and arrogant, but those hardly are 
qualifications to make him the subject of a recall effort bankrolled by 
developers to the tune of $470,000. Most of that money has come from the 
Mission Viejo Co., which built the model city and doesn't want anything to 
interfere with its completion exactly as planned. 
</P>
<P>
There is a citizens' group organizing the recall, which is only too happy to 
have the Mission Viejo Co. money for its effort. But the huge amounts of cash 
-- 12 times what Curtis has raised to defend himself -- skews the political 
process in a way that should be seen by residents as manipulative and cynical. 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say that Curtis is without faults. He has been preoccupied with 
the idea of having the city annex the nearby community of Aegean Hills, a plan 
apparently favored in Aegean Hills but opposed by a majority of the City 
Council. There may be something to the assertion of critics that he wants the 
annexation for personal reasons; he lived there before Mission Viejo became a 
city, and his political ambitions could be tied to receiving support from 
Aegean Hills. And he has disrupted city meetings with his grandstanding style. 
</P>
<P>
But it is important to remember that Curtis represents only one vote on the 
five-member council. He has virtually no power to accomplish his agenda, no 
matter how many times he tries. 
</P>
<P>
As for charges that he has wasted city money in the Aegean Hills annexation 
effort and in other ways, the city ought to be able to protect itself from the 
whims of a maverick councilman in ways that are less drastic than a costly, 
rancorous and time-consuming recall election. Other cities have learned how to 
do this, and Mission Viejo can too. 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Viejo recall falls into another category, one increasingly seen in 
California and one that marks an alarming trend. It is when a development firm 
heavily finances a recall attempt of someone who opposes its plans for the 
community. The citizens of Mission Viejo, even those who dislike Curtis, should 
reject the Mission Viejo Co.'s efforts to interfere in city politics by voting 
"no" to the Curtis recall. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly there is a lot of acrimony in Mission Viejo, and Curtis has been the 
lightning rod for much of it. But there is a time-tested mechanism for removing 
politicians with whom residents are unhappy. It's called an election. By 
mounting this recall, the proponents are doing just what they accuse Curtis of 
doing: wasting Mission Viejo citizens' time, energy and money.

WETLANDS ZONING 1ST STEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not the boldest action it could have taken, but the Huntington Beach City 
Council at least moved in the right direction with the approval last week of a 
"conservation zone" on 142 acres of degraded wetlands along Pacific Coast 
Highway. While the new zoning does not preclude development, it puts strict 
limits on it. 
</P>
<P>
It also advances negotiations that finally could put the acreage in public 
hands, as has been done in other wetlands areas through the use of state 
conservation bonds. State Coastal Conservancy and other monies then may help 
begin to undo some of the damage done over several generations to an ecological 
system that evolved over millions of years. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach City Council pulled its punch on the wetlands area in this 
way: The conservation zone, which stretches along Pacific Coast Highway from 
Beach Boulevard to the Santa Ana River mouth, takes precedence over the 
original zoning, but does not do away with it. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the door slightly open for the property owners to partially develop 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
The city could have made a stronger statement simply by removing the original 
zoning, but it was fearful of legal challenges from the property owners. With 
the conservation zone now in place, the city is hoping that a coalition of 
property owners, environmentalists and government officials can come up with an 
agreement similar to one fashioned for the nearby Bolsa Chica wetlands. Reached 
after years of bitter dispute, that agreement allows development in return for 
restoration of large portions of degraded wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Restoration is, of course, an agonizingly slow process. But it is possible, as 
shown in the 25-acre Talbert Marsh near the Huntington Beach wetlands. A year 
after tidal waters were rechanneled into shallow pools and estuaries there, 
many more birds, including the endangered California least tern, are using the 
area as a breeding ground and resting place. Vegetation is returning. 
</P>
<P>
This renewal has quieted arguments by Huntington Beach wetlands property owners 
that their land is degraded beyond redemption. That leaves only the questions 
of fair compensation and whether there are some portions of their property that 
could be developed within the constraints of the city's zoning and the state 
Coastal Act of 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council's vote for the conservation zone was given a standing ovation 
by an overflow crowd. Some of those who jumped to their feet were newly 
awakened to the importance of coastal preservation by the recent oil spill, 
which took its heaviest toll on Huntington Beach's shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
But many die-hard environmental activists dedicated to wetlands protection also 
were on hand. The conservation zoning is a personal victory for them, and a 
first step for the city.

TIEN'S RESIGNATION AS UCI VICE CHANCELLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tien, we hardly knew you! No sooner did Dr. Chang-Lin Tien arrive at UCI as our 
executive vice chancellor (1 1/2 years ago) than he will be leaving to become 
chancellor at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
I do not expect Dr. Tien to say no to Berkeley's invitation, but I am worried 
that the momentum and spirit of progressive change at UCI will end. 
</P>
<P>
For a while UCI seemed to have taken a step forward; I just hope we do not now 
see it take two steps backward! 
</P>
<P>
If UCI wants to be a great research university, it should aggressively continue 
ensuring that the curriculum reflects not only Western perspectives, but also 
Eastern and Third World views. Also, steps toward the democratization of 
student affairs should be taken. I am especially concerned that we will see a 
decline in American Indians, African-Americans, Chicanos and Latinos among our 
student body, faculty and administrators. These ethnic groups are the most 
severely under-represented in higher education, particularly at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Peltason would be wise to instruct his selection committee for Tien's 
replacement to affirmatively recruit minority candidates for UCI's No. 2 
position. Concerned students will be watching and hope that the campus 
administration will, for a change, seek our involvement in the selection of our 
leadership.

ASSESSING BLAME IN OIL SPILL ALONG COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Any oil spill that kills any amount of wildlife is an ecological disaster. The 
oil spill of Feb. 7 off the Orange County coast has killed more than 100 birds 
and other sea life, and the count will climb higher as the long-term effects of 
the spill become known. 
</P>
<P>
To blame one company for spilling the oil is a gross miscalculation of Southern 
California's interests. Most people in this country use oil in one way or 
another, and these interests are the real cause of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
As with any other man-made disaster, this spill shouldn't have happened. All 
that society can do now is learn from this catastrophe, pass laws to help 
prevent another oil spill and hope that it won't happen again.

PAPER RECYCLING IN NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most all Newport residents put out their old newspapers regularly for city 
collection and recycling. All proceeds go to the city. 
</P>
<P>
If the city would dedicate the profits realized from that collection to the 
purchase of different colored trash bags and distribute them free to all 
residents for the separation of waste glass, aluminum and tin cans, Newport 
Beach would find the residents putting out twice the amount of paper and 
cooperating fully with environmental aims and goals -- all with larger net cash 
returns to the city treasury.

AN EARLY CAMPAIGN OF CURTIS RECALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cartoon showing a man riding a large piggy bank with a dollar sign on it 
toward a sign reading Election Victory (Feb. 18) truly represents the problem 
facing the voters of Mission Viejo on Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of builders and the Mission Viejo Co. has been spending huge sums 
of money to defeat one man, a councilman who is against unlimited development 
of the few remaining open areas. 
</P>
<P>
The arguments given for wanting to recall this councilman (Robert Curtis) are 
without merit. The city of Mission Viejo has five council members. One council 
member cannot enact any law or policy on his own. The true reason so much money 
has been spent by the anti-Curtis forces is that he is independent and is not 
beholden to the Mission Viejo Co. or the builders whose only interests are how 
much money they can make and how quickly on the small amount of land still 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Surely the voters of Mission Viejo can recognize that it is in their interests 
to have one independent, caring city official who will not be a puppet or a 
rubber stamp to powerful interests who seek to enrich themselves at our expense 
and to the detriment of the community.

RESPONSE TO EDITORIAL ON GUN CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to your editorial "Suddenly, It's Realityland (Feb. 18)," former 
President Ronald Reagan might say: "Now there you go again." 
</P>
<P>
Once more you have escalated an isolated, albeit unfortunate, incident of 
firearms misuse into a call for "stricter gun control to keep our streets . . . 
safer." 
</P>
<P>
Little Nayeli Diana Placentia was the victim of horribly bad luck and a 
thoughtless person who committed a very stupid act. She and her family are due 
our compassion and empathy, but the circumstances do not support the 
conclusions fostered in your anti-gun editorial. 
</P>
<P>
The problems associated with the random discharge of firearms cannot be 
ignored. What is required is an intense, continuing educational effort. We must 
foster the notion that reporting random shooters by name and address is the 
right thing to do. And we must provide a safe, anonymous way for their 
neighbors to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Education and enforcement are much better solutions to this problem than your 
continuing efforts to deprive law-abiding citizens of their constitutional 
rights.

AN EARLY CAMPAIGN OF CURTIS RECALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have watched, with much bemusement, the current trials and tribulations of 
Mission Viejo Council Member Bob Curtis and the recall election instigated by 
the so-called "Alliance For Mission Viejo." It brought me back to my high 
school days when I helped Bob in his first campaign for a seat on the student 
council. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't changed all that much. 
</P>
<P>
I have to agree with his critics that Bob can be rude, arrogant and quite 
adamant in his convictions. So what? History has shown us that many of our 
leaders have behaved similarly. It is kind of scary to think that some 
self-serving companies, corporations and individuals are so scared of Bob 
opening his mouth that almost $440,000 has been spent to silence him.

THINGS GET EVEN WORSE FOR SOCKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Say this. Ralph Black and Kevin Crow are getting a lot of exercise. 
</P>
<P>
They serve as sixth attackers for the Sockers. A sixth attacker is used to give 
teams an offensive boost in desperate situations. A more desperate situation 
there has never been for this team. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers (14-20) seem as if they no longer have a pulse. The latest rout was 
6-1 by the St. Louis Storm Saturday night before 9,673 at the San Diego Sports 
Arena. It was the Sockers' fifth loss in six games. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis (17-17) is now second in the Western Division of the MISL, three 
games ahead of the third-place Sockers, who are seven games out of first and 
beginning to wonder if they will ever wake up from the nightmare that his been 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Black and Crow donned their sixth-attacker jerseys with 7:25 to play in an 8-1 
loss to Baltimore Friday. Saturday, they did so with 6:27 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Crow sat motionless in the corner of the locker room afterward. Black, sitting 
to his left, talked quietly. Things have never been this bad. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this team could explode," he said. "I think it exploded in the wrong 
direction. I don't think I've been on a team that's lost back-to-back games as 
bad as we have." 
</P>
<P>
The team as we know it may not be around much longer. Owner Ron Fowler, 
President Ron Cady and Newman held a closed-door meeting 15 minutes after the 
game ended. Discussion undoubtedly centered around a trade, which now appears 
imminent. Fowler said beforehand it would happen if the team didn't show 
improvement Saturday. And he probably doesn't consider it a significant 
improvement that the Sockers lost by five goals instead of seven. 
</P>
<P>
Newman is simply perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like it," he said. "We can't even stay in a game. We 
miss wide-open, gaping goals." 
</P>
<P>
Changes? 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to start fresh, start new faces," he said. "And we are going to go 
again." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers began to unravel late in the second quarter. With the game 
scoreless, they missed a golden opportunity to take a lead when forward Zoran 
Karic mis-hit a close-range shot. Fifteen seconds later, Stan Terlecki was at 
the other end, sending the ball past Socker goalie Zoltan Toth. Thirty-six 
seconds remained in the half. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of a nice goal by midfielder Waad Hirmez midway through the 
third quarter, the Sockers' offense was less than sparkling for the remainder 
of the game. Hirmez took a restart kick from Karic and sent it in off the right 
post with his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
Any shot of life that it gave the Sockers was short-lived. Later in the third, 
Storm midfielder Claudio De Oliveira took the ball the length of the carpet 
into a crowd of Socker defenders and dumped it left to Terlecki, who scored 
left-footed. St. Louis forward Gary Heale scored early in the fourth quarter to 
give the Storm a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after the Sockers went to their sixth-attacker offense, St. Louis kicked 
them three more times when they were down, midfielder Michael Collins scoring 
once and forward Godfrey Ingram twice. 
</P>
<P>
So instead of two victories on this home stand, the Sockers came away with two 
losses. Everything is still the same. Even the questions. 
</P>
<P>
Crow was asked why this team, which has essentially the same key players as 
last year's, has had such a difficult time. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a big difference in the makeup and chemistry," he said. "We lost a lot 
of what I consider experienced professionals. Whether they had smaller roles or 
not doesn't really matter. They knew when to make the passes and how to defend. 
You didn't have to tell them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just the makeup of this team is a lot slower to catch on and deal with 
the situation than in year's past." 
</P>
<P>
Among the experienced players the Sockers have lost since last season is Gus 
Mokalis, who now plays for St. Louis. And Steve Zungul, who has played 
sparingly all year, has been lost experience also. He isn't as fit as he was 
last year, which he attributes to lack of playing time. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, Zungul is no more able to explain the Sockers misfortunes than anyone 
else on this team. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knows the answer," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Socker owner Ron Fowler said he was scheduled to meet with a general manager 
(believed to be from the St. Louis Storm) sometime during or after Saturday 
night's game to discuss trade possibilities. Fowler was disheartened by the 
Sockers' 8-1 loss to Baltimore Friday. "It was a major setback," he said. "I 
think we stunk up the place. If we play as poorly tonight as we did last night, 
we'll make some changes . . . We'll have a very narrow group of players that 
are untouchable." How many? "I think you can count them on one hand." Fowler, 
who said the Sockers are considering making more than one trade, doesn't expect 
a deal to be completed Saturday. "I think with the salary cap ($875,000) it 
takes longer to put a deal together," Fowler said. "We're flat up against our 
salary cap."

PROP. 48 COMPLETES FIRST COURSE; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE ATHLETICS: GRADUATION NEARS FOR FIRST CLASS OF BASKETBALL PLAYERS 
IMPACTED BY THE NCAA'S ACADEMIC STATUTE FOR FRESHMAN ELIGIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM O'CONNELL, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has become as much a part of the vernacular of college basketball as 
3-pointer, small forward and "call a t.o., baby." 
</P>
<P>
The only problem is Prop 48 has become a negative description of a high school 
athlete who has failed to meet the academic minimums for immediate collegiate 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
The current senior class is the first to have entered college with Prop 48 in 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
Three of its most prominent members -- Michigan's Rumeal Robinson and Terry 
Mills and St. John's Jayson Williams -- were among the first to be declared 
ineligible because of it. 
</P>
<P>
It has changed their lives forever and to listen the them, it has changed them 
for the better. 
</P>
<P>
"Every student is different as every person is different," Robinson said before 
a recent practice. "Certain student-athletes can't adjust to playing big-time 
sports at a big-time college. Certain players can adjust. I can only speak for 
myself. I like what I did that freshman year although I didn't like what 
initially happened to me. I liked that I didn't play and that I got a chance to 
socialize with the students. 
</P>
<P>
"It is kind of a shame that players often don't get a chance to do that because 
what is college except a place to come and meet different people and those 
people that you meet might be your friends or the people you socialize with the 
rest of your life." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has come as far as you can from the situation which faced him as an 
incoming freshman. Forget the national championship he won with two free throws 
in overtime. Robinson has overcome a learning disability to graduate on time 
with a grade point index right at the 'B' level. 
</P>
<P>
Still, his name is usually preceded by Prop 48, even though it no longer 
applies. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't let it bother me but it did become a label," Robinson said. "When you 
sat down and watched TV, the announcer said 'Prop 48 student' or whatever. You 
should identify a student-athlete by what he's doing now not what he's done in 
the past. It's kind of sad it does happen but it does and you just have to move 
on." 
</P>
<P>
All three will move on to the NBA next season having played just three years of 
college basketball having been penalized a year of competition by Prop 48. 
</P>
<P>
"They should look at the rule a little more," said Mills, who will leave 
Michigan with a championship ring and a degree with a few more credits this 
summer. "I feel we should be allowed to practice. That wouldn't take away from 
what they're trying to accomplish. It gives you more motivation when you sit 
out; 'Hey, I'm going to get my degree."' 
</P>
<P>
Mills wants others to know how hard that year away from the basketball court 
will be. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to talk to high school players and tell them to be prepared either way 
it goes," he said. "Mainly, I focus on that if you don't make it, don't give 
up. That's something I didn't do. I know I'm capable of doing whatever I put my 
mind to. I tell them 'Just work harder in school so you don't have to sit out 
but if you do be prepared for it." 
</P>
<P>
Williams was crushed when he found out there wouldn't be any basketball for him 
as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
"You never think it's going to happen to you and when it does and you're just 
17, you're immature about it," Williams said before a recent game. "I thought 
they put the rule in just for me, just to keep me out. Right now, I think it 
was for the best because it showed St. John's or any other school could have 
and will carry on without Jayson Williams. It helped me put things in 
perspective for school." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who said he will graduate on time, was limited to 14 games this 
season by injury. He broke his right foot in preseason practice and refractured 
it against Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
Like Robinson and Mills, he is in favor of keeping academic minimums but with 
some changes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they should count so much on one test," Williams said referring 
to the mandatory 700 score on the SAT or 15 on the ACT. "I think you should be 
judged more on your school grades as well. Some people are bad test takers just 
like some people are bad foul shooters. It's not that you're dumb." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson and Mills had each other in the year they sat out. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times I really needed Rumeal," Mills said. "If I acted like it was 
all too much, he would get on me and ask if I wanted people to always think I 
was a loser. I don't want to think of that year without him." 
</P>
<P>
Williams was by himself but was still near his family in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even want to go to the games," he said. "It's like no one even knows 
who you are. I didn't feel like a part of the program. But Mark Jackson and 
(assistant) Ron Rutledge stuck with me." 
</P>
<P>
Williams in turn became the big brother to Billy Singleton and Chuck Sproling 
who followed him in at St. John's in the same academic predicament. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them the most important thing is don't get down and don't worry about 
your physical condition," he said. "I told them to keep up their spirit. It's 
lonely. We took them out after games and made them a part of our family as they 
did with me." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, Mills and Williams, all of whom have been listed as possible NBA 
lottery picks, said they were against making all freshman ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on what their priorities are," Robinson said. "If they have tunnel 
vision for the NBA only let them play. If they don't, though, give them a 
chance to get used to college. Basketball is now a year-long thing and it's 
hard to get the credits in to stay eligible and there's a lot of pressure on 
you when you're not eligible. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a tendency to rush things and you never play your best when you're 
rushing. Me, I didn't have to rush; I enjoyed it."

TRYING TIMES FOR ILLINOIS' LOU HENSON; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: COACH MAINTAINS HIS COOL IN THE FACE OF AN NCAA 
INVESTIGATION THAT PRODUCES CHARGES OF IMPROPRIETIES IN THE ILLINI PROGRAM. 
</P>

<P>
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He will write a book about these days and set everything straight. It will 
answer his critics in a way that he cannot right now. And it will be titled 
something like, "The Loneliest Days of Lou Henson." 
</P>
<P>
But that is still sometime off in the future. 
</P>
<P>
In the present, the coach of 19th-ranked Illinois sits calmly Thursday, but 
tight-lipped, on the NCAA equivalent of Death Row, waiting for the evidence 
that will send the real culprits to the electric chair in his place. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the NCAA set out a bill of particulars of Illinois' alleged sins 
and when Henson took his charges to a game in East Lansing, Mich., two days 
later, the students there waved bills at them and yelled at him, "You're a 
crook, Lou." 
</P>
<P>
He has been an inviting target for a long time, hammered for things both 
significant -- Indiana rival Bobby Knight rarely passes up an opportunity to 
belittle his coaching skills -- and insignificant -- his wraparound hairdo, the 
"Lou-do." And yet no one seems to have gotten deep enough under his skin to 
touch that place where he really hurts and make him complain. 
</P>
<P>
Not even in this past week, one of the roughest 57-year-old Lou Henson has ever 
known. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just born with that temperment," his wife, Mary, said. "In his quiet 
moments, I'm sure he's thinking a lot about the situation and the criticism 
that went with it. But he's got no problem pushing it aside and focusing on 
whatever is necessary. He's been that way since I met him." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't doubt he's heard the screaming," said Stephen Bardo, Illinois' 
articulate senior guard, "We all have. You can't be human and not feel 
something. 
</P>
<P>
"But we really haven't seen any changes in him and we've been looking. He may 
purposely be trying not to change any of the circumstances around the team to 
keep us from focusing on this." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, a cold winter rain has already filtered most of the light 
peeking through a thin strip of windows on the back wall of his cramped office. 
But Henson is in the midst of a never-ending good mood, smiling. He begins 
drawing a map. 
</P>
<P>
It is an accurate enough, but not very elaborate map. The state of Illinois is 
a rectangle in the middle of the lined, yellow legal pad, the Champaign campus 
a small circle at its center. Iowa is to the left, Indiana to the right. 
</P>
<P>
"Why shouldn't we have an advantage recruiting here and here and here?" Henson 
said, filling every corner of makeshift Illinois with dots from a black pen. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's what makes me the most uncomfortable about this whole mess," Henson 
said. "Because when bad things happen to us, everybody around us stands to 
benefit." 
</P>
<P>
Then he stops cold. What Lou Henson dares not say -- at least not now, anyway 
-- is what everybody else in Champaign has been saying for days. That jealous 
neighbors, the names most often mentioned belong to University of Iowa 
recruiter Bruce Pearl and Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps, helped trump up the 
charges and called in the cops. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago Thursday, the NCAA leveled charges that Illinois committed six major 
rules violations in recruiting two players over the last two years: LaPhonso 
Ellis, a high school All-America who played at nearby East St. Louis and is now 
a sophomore at Notre Dame; and Deon Thomas, another high school All-America 
from Chicago's Public League and now a freshman at Illinois, though he has been 
barred by the school from playing a single minute this season. 
</P>
<P>
At the risk of oversimplification, both recruits allegedly were promised 
eye-popping cash packages -- about $25,000 in Thomas' case and $80,000 for 
Ellis -- a car and financial assistance to help relocate a relative. 
</P>
<P>
None of the charges implicate Henson, though almost each names Jimmy Collins, 
his assistant coach and chief recruiter. As a college player, Collins brought 
Henson and New Mexico State from obscurity to the Final Four in 1970; as a 
recruiter these past seven seasons, he has brought the finest talent from 
basketball-rich Illinois and Chicago's especially wealthy Public League to 
sleepy Champaign. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, Collins frequently bumped heads with Pearl and almost always 
won. That seems to be why Pearl phoned Thomas late one evening in May, and 
unbeknownst to Thomas (and legal in Iowa) taped a telephone conversation 
between the two. In it, Thomas apparently rambles on carelessly about what 
Illinois has put on the table, and not long after that, the NCAA gets a listen. 
</P>
<P>
That tape's effectiveness as a weapon, Illinois' defenders say, will soon be 
rendered harmless. Thomas, they note, already has characterized his half of the 
conversation as meaningless bragging, an immature attempt to get Pearl off his 
back. And equally important, detractors belive they can prove the tape has been 
doctored, noting a telephone bill shows the conversation to be 14 minutes long 
and only six of those minutes are captured on tape. 
</P>
<P>
The motives in Ellis' case, though, are decidedly less apparent. For one thing, 
Ellis said nothing about any offers of payola for a year. For another, like 
Thomas, Ellis' high school coach and almost everyone close to him -- friends 
and relatives alike -- have denied any knowledge of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Which is how the suspicion began that somebody put Ellis up to this and how the 
finger-pointing settled on Phelps, who thus far has studiously avoided stepping 
into the fray. 
</P>
<P>
But sources close to the investigation, who declined to be identified, offer 
the following reasons: Phelps is upset because Illinois beat Notre Dame to the 
punch on a TV contract with Chicago superstation WGN; Phelps is upset by his 
inability to recruit in Chicago and is feeling the heat from alumni similarly 
upset; Phelps, simply, has never liked Henson, and couldn't pass up an 
opportunity to stoke a fire that Pearl had already set. 
</P>
<P>
Henson won't field any of the possibilities, but it's clear this dull Thursday 
morning that none of them has ruined his day. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, Illinois upset No. 9 Purdue, virtually guaranteeing its eighth 
straight NCAA berth, its ninth in Henson's 15 years, and he has an abiding 
faith that tomorrow will be even better. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he knows come April, or June, or whenever it is the NCAA gets 
around to deciding this case, he could become a sacrificial lamb, his firing an 
offering part of the cleansing ritual schools undergo to appease the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
"A head coach should take the blame," Henson said, eyes still bright. "It's 
like a family. You have kids at home and they may do something completely 
outside your reach. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's still," he said, "your responsibility. And that still means something 
to me."

IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD, BUT NBA'S IMPORTS MAKE PROGRESS

Americanization has taken many forms for the NBA's first group of celebrated 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
Zarko loves Pizza Hut. Vlade loves L.A. Alexander loves ESPN, much to his 
wife's dismay. Sarunas already has discovered that American trademark -- the 
misquote. And Drazen has discovered another American athletic staple -- the 
freebie. He has found a willing Jeep dealer to provide a Cherokee for services 
to be rendered. 
</P>
<P>
Five of Eastern Europe's hardwood heroes are more than halfway through their 
first season in the NBA, getting a taste of everything from per diem to pick 
and rolls. The transition from EuroHoops to the NBA has been predictably 
difficult, with basketball sometimes the least of the problems. In addition to 
the obvious language barrier, one has been unable to kick a smoking habit while 
another had preseason back surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Few expected anything extraordinary from the five. Soviet hockey players had 
shown since 1973 they could compete and beat the NHL's best and brawniest. All 
Soviet basketball had to show for itself the past 17 years is that its best 
could defeat an ad hoc team of United States collegians if it had a sympathetic 
timer (Munich, West Germany, 1972), or if John Thompson happened to be the 
opposing coach (Seoul, South Korea, 1988). And the Yugoslavs generally were one 
small step behind the Soviets and one giant leap behind the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
All five, lionized in the countries they left (Vlade Divac's wedding was on 
national television in Yugoslavia), must cope with another American basketball 
tradition: pine time. Only two are seeing what could be viewed as meaningful 
minutes. They are, after all, rookies. You know it's adjustment time when Divac 
points out that Yugoslavs don't think, enjoy or play defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the first year is a wash for these kids," says Larry Brown, the San 
Antonio Spurs coach whose team has Zarko Paspalj, a 6-foot-9 forward who was 
the most valuable player in the European Club League last year. "If something 
happens, you've got to talk, but by the time I get to him, it has happened too 
quickly and something else is going on. With all the adjustments, it really is 
a wash." 
</P>
<P>
Paspalj's two compatriots are Divac, the 7-foot center who has stepped in and 
provided immediate relief for the Lakers, and Drazen Petrovic, a European 
superstar of almost Jordanesque proportions, who has been hampered by injuries 
and NBA reality trying to make it big in Portland with the Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
All three Yugoslavs played on club teams last season (Petrovic played for Real 
Madrid in Spain), and were on the silver-medal Olympic team in Seoul. They have 
been joined in this era of open competition by two Soviets, Sarunas 
Marciulionis, who plays for the Golden State Warriors, and Alexander Volkov, 
who plays for the Atlanta Hawks. Those two were on the gold-medal winning team 
in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Of the five, Divac and Marciulionis have enjoyed the most success. In a humdrum 
year for rookies -- with notable exception David Robinson -- each has a shot at 
making the all-rookie team. 
</P>
<P>
None of the five is suffering financially; salaries range from Paspalj's 
comparatively meager $350,000 to Petrovic's $800,000. Some (such as Divac) have 
to return specified amounts to their country as a quid pro quo for their 
blessing to savor capitalism as it was meant to be savored. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the five, Petrovic and Paspalj, had to go to court to get permission to 
play in the NBA. Marciulionis landed in Golden State because of a bond with 
Donn Nelson, the coach's son. The two Soviets had played with and against the 
Hawks in exhibition settings and Divac joined the Lakers the way most 
collegians enter the NBA: via the draft. 
</P>
<P>
All hope to play this summer for their country in either the Goodwill Games, 
the World Championships, or both. Then, it's probably onto another season with 
the world's best. Here's a look at each of the five trail blazers, starting 
with the real Trail Blazer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DRAZEN PETROVIC 
</P>
<P>
To say the NBA has been an eye-opener to Petrovic is to say that it rains 
occasionally in Portland. He and the Trail Blazers both envisioned a big-time 
role as the team's third guard, but he missed most of training camp because of 
back surgery (removal of a cyst) and the subsequent getting acquainted period 
has delayed any immediate gratification for player or team. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Petrovic, who once scored 112 points in a club game and had 63 
in Real Madrid's European Cup victory, is gradually seeing more time. But Coach 
Rick Adelman, with his team inhaling Laker fumes at close range, is 
understandably hesitant to make any big changes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very difficult for me. Very new," Petrovic said. "In November, 
December, I no play much. But I'm starting to play now and I feel more like a 
part of the team." 
</P>
<P>
Petrovic's transition was eased by a visit from his parents, who spent seven 
weeks with him in Portland. His girlfriend, Renata Cajic, also is a frequent 
companion. On the court, he has supplanted rookie Byron Irvin as the primary 
backup to Clyde Drexler, still a nominal role in that Drexler averages 37 
minutes a game. 
</P>
<P>
Petrovic, according to Portland attorney Nick Goyak, has become obsessed with 
making it big for the Blazers. The rookie hasn't bought a home because it would 
be too time consuming. Goyak said Petrovic has little interest in any other 
sport -- "less than any athlete I've known" -- because of his desire to 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Petrovic, a Portland third-round draft pick in 1986, has been accustomed to top 
billing and had been viewed by some as the best non-NBA guard in the world. At 
19, he was named the top player on the Yugoslav National Team. His deal with 
Portland averages out to almost $1.3 million per year, including a $375,000 
signing bonus but excluding a $1 million interest-free loan needed to extricate 
himself from his contract with Real Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was unfair to him that a lot was said about what he was going to 
be," Adelman said. "There was a lot of build-up before he got here, a lot of 
pressure. People said he was going to be an instant star. I don't think 
anybody's going to be an instant star, especially when you have to learn two 
positions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
VLADE DIVAC 
</P>
<P>
Already, he and his wife have the apartment in scenic Marina Del Ray with a 
Porsche on the way. "It is too much, very, very nice," Divac says of Los 
Angeles. Of his present situation, he is equally effusive. "The L. A. Lakers. I 
like them. I have Magic (Johnson) and Byron (Scott). I can't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Believe it. The Lakers are believers and the rest of the NBA is envious. 
Somehow, Divac lasted all the way until the 26th pick in June's NBA draft. The 
Lakers, with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar retiring, deliberated and selected the 
21-year-old Yugoslav center. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time you draft a player, you have to expect he's going to be a pretty 
good player," says Lakers General Manager Jerry West. "You may turn out to be 
wrong, but you have to think he can play. Otherwise, why waste the pick? That's 
asinine. Vlade can play. Period." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone had Divac rated high. Indiana Coach Dick Versace swears the Pacers 
would have drafted Divac with the No. 8 pick had they known Steve Stipanovich 
was finished. Boston Celtics President Red Auerbach has said he wished he had 
taken Divac instead of Michael Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it was the Lakers who pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
"We had kind of a mixed camp," West recalls. "I called our owner and said 
((Divac) was just too talented and too big to pass up." 
</P>
<P>
Divac, in New York for the draft, immediately donned a Lakers hat. Shortly 
thereafter, he says, he gave up smoking. He then showed some impressive flashes 
in training camp and is the only Eastern European to have played in every one 
of his team's games. 
</P>
<P>
Lakers Cach Pat Riley likens Divac to a 7-1 Alvan Adams, an expert passer and 
more of a finesse center than the overpowering big man. Divac can, however, 
hold his own defensively in the post and already has developed a neat trick 
where he leans on his man, then pulls away and sneaks in front to swipe an 
entry pass. 
</P>
<P>
"I still must work on my defense," he said. "Everybody in Europe, all they like 
is scoring. The first stats are offensive stats." 
</P>
<P>
Divac can score. He lit up Ralph Sampson for 25 points. But the next game he 
did little except get four quick fouls. "My problem in the NBA," he sighs. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers play Divac almost 20 minutes a game, primarily as Mychal Thompson's 
understudy. Divac averages almost 16 rebounds and more than three blocked shots 
per 48 minutes, both team highs. 
</P>
<P>
So far, no one is complaining. In a city with such fast-food landmarks as 
Fatburger and Tommy's, how can the hamburger-addicted Divac be anything but 
elated? 
</P>
<P>
"This is my dream," he says, echoing a refrain by all of the imports. "To play 
in the NBA, I had to wait 21 years. But my dream is here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ZARGO PASPALJ 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 12, when the San Antonio Spurs were in Boston, the club sent rookie 
Yugoslav forward Zarko Paspalj to Cambridge, Mass., to see a hypnotist. The man 
was busy, booked until late March, but the Spurs were desperate. The reason? 
Smoking. As in up to three packs a day. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, as the Spurs boarded the team bus to the game, Paspalj saw Coach 
Larry Brown and grinned. "Look coach," he says, his mouth full of something. 
"Chocolates." 
</P>
<P>
Great, thinks Brown. It's a good thing the hypnotist specializes in eating 
disorders as well. But what else could he expect from someone whose idea of 
lunch is espresso and Coca-Cola and whose gourmet food is Pizza Hut supreme 
pizza, which he claims to eat five times a week. 
</P>
<P>
"Pizza not for everybody," Pasplaj said. "But for me, it's great." 
</P>
<P>
Soon thereafter, Paspalj was lighting it up again. Not on the court, but in the 
smoking sections of airplanes, where he prefers to ride instead of first class. 
</P>
<P>
Brown may have given up on Paspalj as a non-smoker, but the coach says there is 
hope for the 23-year-old as an NBA player. So far, however, Paspalj has had 
little chance to, er, smoke, as he is relegated mainly to mop-up duty. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard," Brown said. "He was a national hero and I don't think he 
understands being put into the game in the last three minutes. But he is a 
great kid. He's bright. He has a feel for the game. Hopefully, it will all work 
out for him." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SARUNAS MARCIULIONIS 
</P>
<P>
The story goes that Marciulionis went to the local supermarket one day. And 
back the next day. And the next. Just to make sure all the goodies that were 
there the first day would also be there the second and third days. 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," he said. "I've been to America many times. I know what they have. 
But what upsets me is they say I say that Lithuania has best basketball in 
world except for black America. I never say that. Now, I try to be careful." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-5 Marciulionis was the first Soviet to sign a contract with an NBA team, 
a three-year deal worth close to $3.9 million. He had the reputation of being a 
Lithuanian Gail Goodrich, but in reality, he's a Gold's Gym cover boy via 
comparison. He has been recognized as one of the top guards in the world for 
some years. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a close kinship with Don Nelson, whom he met when the Soviets played 
an Athletes In Action team, Marciulionis agreed to play for the Warriors. They 
have used him as a third guard and he is seeing more than 22 minutes a game, 
the most of the East Europeans, though he has seen less action of late. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything here is much faster. Much stronger," he said. "It's a different 
style. In Soviet Union, we didn't pay attention to rebounding and defense. But 
here, it's important." 
</P>
<P>
The NBA wasn't a novelty to Marciulionis. There had been a combined training 
camp setting with the Atlanta Hawks and a Russian tour by Atlanta in 1988. And 
he heard of the Boston Celtics and rooted for them when they played the Lakers 
in the NBA finals. Larry Bird -- big surprise -- was his favorite player. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he started thinking he might actually get a chance to play in 
the planet's foremost league. 
</P>
<P>
"Back then," he said, "it was just dreaming. I could not believe in two years 
that I'd be on the same floor with Larry Bird." 
</P>
<P>
Marciulionis is a devoted athlete. He has fitness and weight machines in his 
home in Alameda. "He has to take care of his body," said Warriors assistant 
Garry St. Jean, "because of his willingness to bang. You just don't see guards 
willing to take the hits that he's willing to take." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ALEXANDER VOLKOV 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Hawks were in the throes of a losing streak and were in Charlotte 
to play the Hornets. The team chose Volkov as their captain for the game and he 
went to halfcourt, trying to understand referee Joe Crawford, a struggle for 
even the most astute American. 
</P>
<P>
When he got back to the bench, his teammates asked what he had learned. Volkov 
shook his head. His teammates laughed and went out and won the game. 
</P>
<P>
Volkov, a 6-10 forward with a face that's equal parts Ivan Lendl and Ronnie 
Howard, has gone from national star to bench warmer in a year. He was the MVP 
in the Soviet Union last season. This year, he is fighting a losing battle for 
time among the Hawks' depth-laden front line. 
</P>
<P>
But he wouldn't change a thing. He's happy. He's wealthy (around $600,000 per 
year) and has adapted quite nicely to the NBA and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it has been four months," he said. "It's more real now. But I wake up 
in the morning and sometimes I think I'm still dreaming." 
</P>
<P>
Volkov's biggest problem with American abundance is arguing with his wife, 
Alla, over whether to watch ESPN or movies. He broke down and finally bought a 
device enabling him to see both channels on one screen. 
</P>
<P>
On the court, Volkov is averaging about 13 minutes a game and has a high of 17 
points. He definitely has NBA skills and his height, combined with his 
versatility, make him an intriguing prospect. 
</P>
<P>
"He gives us flexibility," Coach Mike Fratello said. "But the hardest thing for 
him has to be the things outside basketball. This is a national hero and he's 
sitting for an extended period of time. And trying to learn a new language and 
culture. If the roles were reversed, I don't think I could handle it half as 
well."

PHOENIX GUARD HORNACEK PROVING A POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Phoenix Sun guard Jeff Hornacek admits, "Nothing's really been easy for me my 
whole basketball career." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the points always seem to show up; his 17.9 average is third-best on the 
Suns. And the assists are there; he's the all-time leader at Iowa State. Even 
though he's a relatively small guard, the rebounds have been there, too; he's 
averaging 4.7. "Not bad for a non-jumping, 6-3 white guy," Hornacek cracks. 
</P>
<P>
But getting a chance to put up such numbers has been the hard part. 
</P>
<P>
As a high school senior in LaGrange, Ill., Hornacek averaged 20 points on a 
team that won regional and sectional titles. Yet few colleges sought him. 
</P>
<P>
He wound up at Iowa State in 1981 as a walk-on. Playing small forward for Coach 
Johnny Orr, Hornacek redshirted his first year. The following season, he was 
awarded a scholarship and played five to six minutes a game as a backup 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
"Then Coach Orr asked me if I could play point guard," Hornacek said, "and I 
told him I played it my first two years in high school." 
</P>
<P>
Hornacek then started turning heads with his assists and scoring. And he was 
always working hard. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an unselfish, hard worker," Orr said. "A great shooter, a hell of a 
rebounder, and instincts, boy, did he have instincts for the game. He was a 
leader." 
</P>
<P>
Then came time for the pros. Again, few teams were interested. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought about playing in the NBA," Hornacek said, "or let's say it 
wasn't something I was counting on. It really came down to a predraft camp in 
Chicago. I had a pretty good camp, and that is where the Suns saw me." 
</P>
<P>
The Suns took Hornacek in the second round of the 1986 draft. Generally, 50 
percent of second-round picks don't make their team. But as a backup point 
guard to Jay Humphries, Hornacek averaged 20 minutes a game his rookie year, 
much of that in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty proud of the fact I played a lot in the fourth quarter," Hornacek 
said. "I equated that as they had a lot of confidence in me to be out there at 
that time." 
</P>
<P>
Hornacek averaged 4.5 assists and 5.3 points as a rookie. His second year was 
even more encouraging. Still a backup, he averaged 27 minutes, 6.6 assists and 
9.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the drug scandal that plagued the Suns in 1987-88 and triggered a 
personnel shake-up. In February 1988, Cotton Fitzsimmons, then director of 
player personnel and now the coach, got rid of Walter Davis, Larry Nance, James 
Edwards and Humphries, four-fifths of the starting lineup. Fitzsimmons 
seemingly was trying to wipe out the drug image being tagged on the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
But Hornacek stayed. "Jeff was the only guy I thought had the character and 
characteristics it takes to have a good team," Fitzsimmons said. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the season, the starting lineup was Hornacek and Kevin Johnson at 
guard, Mark West at center and Eddie Johnson and Armon Gilliam at forward. 
</P>
<P>
"When they traded Jay, I thought I would move into the starting point guard 
spot," Hornacek said. "I had never seen Kevin play, but I knew he was good. 
Cotton told me Kevin was going to be the point guard because he was more of a 
penetrater. Well, that was fine because I was starting at the other guard. But 
I thought at least they should make him come in here and earn the point guard. 
They just gave it to him. I guess they knew what they were doing." 
</P>
<P>
But despite a good working relationship with Kevin Johnson and a better scoring 
average, Hornacek was on the bench when the 1988-89 season began. The Suns 
started 6-6 Dan Majerle, their top draft pick, as the No. 2 guard. But after 
only two games, both losses, Hornacek was back as a starter and increased his 
scoring average to 13.5. 
</P>
<P>
Guess what? Majerle again started this season as the No. 2 guard. But it didn't 
last long. Hornacek moved back into the starting lineup, and when Eddie Johnson 
was injured, he was asked to take up some of the scoring slack. Hornacek has 
responded and is sixth in field-goal percentage in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Once more, it seems as though Hornacek has established himself. But for how 
long? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little frustrating," Hornacek said. "You think you proved something the 
year before, and then you just about have to start over again. But like I said, 
nothing's really been easy for me in my basketball career. I've had to earn 
making teams, earn playing time. It's not that big of a deal, though, as I 
don't mind working hard."

EL CAMINO UPSETS SANTA MONICA, 81-79 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
El Camino College could have stayed home and cruised through its first-round 
playoff game against a 16-15 Riverside team. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, a last-minute change in the seedings made 23rd-seeded El Camino 
(21-10) have to play its game of the season to post an 81-79 upset of 
10th-seeded Santa Monica (26-9) in front of a small but rowdy Westside crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally beat another quality team," said El Camino Coach Ron McClurkin, 
whose team finished in a three-way tie for third in the South Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Coach John McMullen would not comment except to say he was happy 
to play a tougher team in the first round. Originally Santa Monica was to play 
Long Beach (15-15). 
</P>
<P>
McMullen's team played well, but the Warriors were clearly hungry for a win. 
Five El Camino players scored in double figures, and the team played fierce 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore guard Larry Lockley led the Warriors with 21 points, and forward 
David Keeter had 13 before fouling out of the game with 11:48 remaining. Frank 
Beatty also had 13 points, and Steve Leary and Keith Brown scored 12 and 11 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino took a 44-40 halftime edge on Lockley's baseline jumper at the 
buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors benefited from the early ejection of Santa Monica freshman point 
guard Chico Langston, who threw a punch at El Camino guard Allen Caveness. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors kept the lead until midway through the second half, when Santa 
Monica's Jason Shea hit a three-pointer to put the Corsairs ahead, 61-60. El 
Camino tied the score at 64-64 with 8:35 remaining and regained the lead on two 
Steven Leary free throws with 6:30 left. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino advances Wednesday to play L.A. City College, which defeated Mira 
Costa, 81-72, on Saturday.

TOROS FALL TO RIVERSIDE IN LAST BID FOR PLAYOFFS, 68-62 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
When the season began, no one really figured that Cal State Dominguez Hills, 
with three freshmen starters, would be battling for a playoff spot in its final 
game. 
</P>
<P>
So it was an accomplishment for the 10-17 Toros to take the floor Saturday 
night, needing a victory and a little help up the road at Cal State Los Angeles 
to advance to post-season play in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills got the help it needed: Cal Poly San Luis Obispo defeated L.A., 
86-68. But the Toros forgot to take care of things on their court, stumbling 
against senior-laden UC Riverside, 68-62. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros finished 6-8 and in sixth place in the CCAA. Bakersfield, Riverside, 
San Luis Obispo and L.A. advance to the conference tournament next weekend in 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros simply waited too long to make a run, and when they finally did, a 
questionable charging call against guard Robert Barksdale with 1:15 left 
nullified a basket that would have cut Riverside's lead to five points. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills took a 10-4 lead with 14:49 left in the first half, but from 
there it was all Riverside. In the next 11 minutes, the Highlanders outscored 
the Toros, 26-10. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Ceballos, who had 20 points for the game, spurred the Riverside burst. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the Toros had weak legs after Friday night's physical 72-65 victory 
over Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside opened a 46-35 lead with 14 minutes remaining, but Dominguez Hills, 
thanks to four free throws by freshman guard Raymond Bennett, cut it to 48-43 
with 10:48. 
</P>
<P>
Senior guard Reggie Howard put the game solidly in the Highlanders' favor. With 
9:45 to go he put Riverside up, 50-43 with a basket, then extended the lead to 
10 points on a three-point basket at the 8:57 mark. A minute and a half later 
he dished off to guard Marcellus Smith for a lay-in and a 55-43 lead.

After stumbling and bumbling its way through three quarters Saturday, Santa 
Ynez High School finally showed the stuff that No. 1-seeded teams are made of. 
It was a brief flash, to be sure, but it was enough to advance the Pirates to 
the championship game of the 2-AA girls' playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In a four-minute span at the start of the fourth quarter, Santa Ynez subdued 
Santa Margarita and then coasted to a 54-43 victory at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it was tonight, but our timing was off," Santa Ynez Coach Jo 
Ann Reck said. "I'm just glad we were able to shake it off in the fourth 
quarter." 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates (21-3) went on a 12-0 run at the start of the fourth quarter to 
break a 28-28 tie. Jennifer DeMatteo and Amy Kisling each scored six points 
during the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
But it was defense that turned the game around. After watching Santa 
Margarita's Kristen Mulligan carve up the Pirates' 2-3 zone through three 
quarters, Reck switched to a box-and-one. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan came into the game averaging 24 points and had scored 32 in the 
Eagles' quarterfinal victory over Beaumont Wednesday. But reserve guard Denicia 
Dommeyer held Mulligan scoreless, and her teammates didn't respond with any 
points of their own for the first 3:46 of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were going to win because they were staying in that 2-3 zone," 
Santa Margarita Coach Jeff Seckman said. "There's no way that can stop Kristen. 
But I have to give their coach credit. She realized how to stop us." 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan, a sophomore, finished with 26 points, most of which came after the 
game had been decided. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think we would need a gimmick defense to stop her," Reck said. "But 
she's a lot better than I thought. I told Dommeyer to stop her. Brilliant 
coaching, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles (20-7), who have only one player taller than 5-foot-7, packed their 
defense in tight to take away the Pirates' inside game. The ploy worked well 
for three quarters, but DeMatteo (18 points) sank two three-point field goals 
at the start of the fourth quarter to give Santa Ynez a 34-28 lead. 
</P>
<P>
DeMatteo's shooting loosened up Santa Margarita's defense. Kisling (19 points) 
took advantage and scored nine points in the fourth quarter.

CHATSWORTH GIRLS WIN 2ND CITY SOCCER TITLE

<P>
Sooner or later, someone might devise a way to stop the Chatsworth High girls' 
soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
For the second year in a row, the Chancellors plowed through Valley League and 
playoff opponents and, with a 3-0 victory over Palisades at Birmingham High on 
Saturday, placed another City Section championship trophy on their shelf. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth first-year Coach Bob Horn has visions of a three-peat because all of 
his players will return next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We were stronger this year than last year, and we're going to be stronger next 
year than this year," Horn said. "I don't want to sound cocky, but we have a 
lot of weapons." 
</P>
<P>
Forward Kris Bassler and defender Kim Constantino shared the tournament MVP 
award. Horn suggested that midfielder Heather Gorman, who scored on a breakaway 
at the 17-minute mark in the first half to give the Chancellors a 1-0 lead, 
also should have shared in the award. 
</P>
<P>
One minute after Gorman's goal, a Palisades defensive error helped Bassler 
score a goal that pushed Chatsworth's lead to 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
"We played a 4-4-2 defense trying to control the middle," Dolphin Coach Rick 
Horner said. "Our sweeper tried to come up and let (Bassler) have a one-on-one 
with our goalkeeper." 
</P>
<P>
With three minutes remaining, Constantino scored into an open goal from 20 
yards after a collision between Chatsworth's Sarah Murphy and Dolphin 
goalkeeper Amber Wuchitech sent the ball bouncing into the right flank. 
Wuchitech left the match sporting a black eye. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth (15-1-1), the Valley League champion, thumped Belmont, 14-0, and 
edged City League champion San Pedro, 4-2, in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking they might have underestimated us, but they didn't," Horner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins (11-3-1), who outscored their opponents, 57-11, this season, upset 
El Camino Real, 2-1, and 1989 City runner-up Grant, 1-0, en route to the final. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth crunched Palisades, 10-0, in a first-round playoff match a year ago.

In the other 3-AA semifinal: 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes 62, Estancia 48 -- Estancia High School's unexpected advance to 
the semifinals came to a halt when it fell to fourth-seeded Palos Verdes at 
University High in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"We never thought we'd be here," Estancia Coach Lisa McNamee said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the farthest we've gone in nine years. It was a real growing 
experience for next year." 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes (27-4) used its height advantage to advance to next week's final 
against Brea. The Sea Kings' tall front line of Monique Morehouse, Mary Maloney 
and Kristen Jaconi dominated the backboards and Palos Verdes took a 49-33 lead 
with 3:41 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Estancia (14-13) fought back behind the shooting of Patrice Lumpkin and 
Maria Garcia to trail 50-43 at the end of the quarter. Palos Verdes rebuilt the 
lead when the Eagles hit only two of 16 shots in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Their box-and-one (defense) rattled (forward) Melody (Earle)," McNamee said. 
"She normally hits all of those shots." Lumpkin and Robin Cordrey led Estancia 
in scoring with 17 and 10 points, respectively. Jaconi led Palos Verdes with 
19. TOM BIRSCHBACH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the fourth consecutive playoff game, Costa Mesa High School led at halftime 
only to come out soft in the third quarter and fall behind. 
</P>
<P>
But once again, the Mustangs reestablished their intensity by the fourth 
quarter, this time upsetting second-seeded South Hills, 61-55, in the 
semifinals of the Southern Section 3-A girls' basketball playoffs Saturday 
night at Estancia High School. 
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Costa Mesa (16-11) meets top-seeded Rancho Alamitos in the final at 
6:45 p.m. Wednesday at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs' standout underclassmen -- freshman Olivia DiCamilli and junior 
Rachel Ward -- combined for 45 points. 
</P>
<P>
Using jump shots from between 10 feet to 15 feet, power layups and 5-foot 
turnaround jumpers, DiCamilli connected on 10 of 20 shots and eight of 11 free 
throws for 28 points. Ward went strictly for the rainbow set shot, connecting 
on six of 18 for 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
The two scored all 18 of Costa Mesa's points in first quarter. The Mustangs 
led, 18-12, on the strength of their full-court press and man-to-man defense. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa led by as many as 10 points, 24-14, early in the second quarter and 
had a 36-29 lead at the half. South Hills (19-6) made nine turnovers in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
"They played good pressure defense," South Hills Coach Paul Reed said. "I 
thought we would handle their pressure a little better." 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, the Huskies not only handled Costa Mesa's pressure, they 
applied their own. Costa Mesa turned the ball over on six consecutive 
possessions as the Huskies went on an 8-0 run to take a 37-36 lead with about 
five minutes to play in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley Figueroa scored 10 of her 19 points in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But with about three minutes to play, the momentum shifted when Costa Mesa 
Coach Jim Weeks put 4-9 guard Vicki Diaz into the game with the Mustangs 
trailing, 40-42. 
</P>
<P>
"I put her in for her intensity, her defense, her quickness," Weeks said. "She 
gives us great speed, great fire. She's only 4-9, and a lot of times she 
doesn't match up well, but against this team she did." 
</P>
<P>
With Diaz helping against the press, the Mustangs settled down, forcing South 
Hills into six turnovers before the quarter's end. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz's shot from the top of the key with 30 seconds remaining put Costa Mesa 
ahead, 46-42, and Ward added two free throws as the Mustangs took a 48-42 lead 
and pulled away.

The Rancho Alamitos girls' basketball team advanced further than any other in 
the high school's history, reaching the 3-A final with a 76-50 semifinal 
victory over San Dimas Saturday night at Bolsa Grande High School. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Vaqueros took a 17-0 lead to start the game, San Dimas fought back 
behind forward Natalie Kramer (17 points) to pull within 39-38 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
But San Dimas went cold in the second half, managing only 12 points and 
six-for-35 (17%) shooting. And a minute into the fourth quarter, Kramer fouled 
out. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros were hot outside, making 12 three-point baskets, with Shellie 
Tsuji (18 points) and Melinda Lira (15 points) hitting five each. 
</P>
<P>
"My two guards had their best games of the season tonight, but it was also a 
total team effort tonight," Rancho Alamitos Coach Bob Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Jenny Newsome had 11 points and 11 rebounds in the third period to 
spark Rancho Alamitos to a 58-46 lead at quarter's end. She finished with a 
team-high 19 points and 14 rebounds. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

5 WRESTLERS QUALIFY FOR STATE MEET BY PLACING IN MASTERS 
</P>

<P>
Five wrestlers from three South Bay high schools placed in the top six or 
better in their weight divisions Saturday at the Masters Meet at Fountain 
Valley High School. That qualified them for the state meet at the University of 
the Pacific in Stockton this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Morningside's Danny Katoa and West Torrance's Josh Gormley, two of 
the area's best hopes for a state championship, both made it to the final 
matches in their divisions at the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
Katoa, a 191-pound junior, placed second to Canyon's Zachary Cooper, the 
defending state champion. Gormley, a heavyweight, placed second to Rim of the 
World's Jeff Maier. 
</P>
<P>
Katoa got into the final with three close decisions: 8-5 over Huntington 
Beach's Travis Cooper, 7-4 over Westlake's David Schumm and 6-4 over Coachella 
Valley's Gabriel Herrera. 
</P>
<P>
In the final, Zachary Cooper, leading 5-1, pinned Katoa at 3:32. "He told me 
afterwards it was his hardest match of the year," Katoa said. 
</P>
<P>
It was also Cooper's longest match of the day. His previous three matches 
lasted a total of less than two minutes, resulting in two pins and a default 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Gormley made a comeback at the Masters after a disappointing fifth-place finish 
at the Southern Section 3-A Meet last weekend, where he had been the top seed 
in his division. 
</P>
<P>
He won his first three matches Saturday rather handily. He decisioned Newbury's 
Jeff Jay, 8-2, pinned Damien's Mike Balian 25 seconds into the match and 
defeated Valencia's Paul Jaramillo, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Jaramillo, the 3-A champion, was twice penalized two points for stalling. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-4, 230-pound Gormley, a junior, was overmatched in the final against 
Maier, a senior who is four inches taller and 20 pounds heavier. 
</P>
<P>
Other qualifers for the state meet include Torrance's Chris Xavier (98), who 
placed third, and Erick Gaunt (165), who placed fifth. West's Demian Botero 
(145) also placed fifth.

HARBOR BEATS COLLEGE OF THE DESERT, 88-87 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A basket by Roneil Powell with 11 seconds left gave host Harbor College a wild 
88-87 win Saturday over College of the Desert in the first round of the state 
community college playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor (23-12), seeded 14th, will visit No. 3-seeded Rancho Santiago, which had 
a bye, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
College of the Desert (21-12) led most of the second half before Harbor, paced 
by Eric Carpenter's 25 points and Terry Nelson's 21 points and 11 rebounds, 
closed the gap. A Desert shot to win with seven seconds left was disallowed 
because of a charging foul, Harbor spokesman Gary Wood said.

WEST TORRANCE GIRLS BEAT JITTERS, THEN BISHOP MONTGOMERY, 75-61

<TEXT>
<P>
Going into Saturday night's Southern Section 4-A girls basketball semifinals, 
West Torrance High clearly had an edge in experience over Bishop Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors had six seniors, including three starters. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights had only one senior, their starting lineup included a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
But as Bishop Montgomery took a 16-14 lead at the end of the first quarter, it 
was West that was suffering from big-game pressure, according to the Warriors' 
leading scorer, guard Rosa Olloque. 
</P>
<P>
But the rest of the game was a different story. Olloque, who scored 25 points, 
led West (23-4) to a 75-61 win. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little nervous before the game," admitted Olloque, who had only five 
first-quarter points. 
</P>
<P>
She was at her best when it counted the most, though. Olloque scored 17 
second-half points, including 12 in the fourth quarter, when she went 5 for 5 
from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights (17-10) were led by freshman Natalie Graham's game-high 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
A Graham free throw gave Bishop Montgomery its last lead of the game at 19-18 
with 4:55 left in the second quarter. The Warriors followed with an 8-0 run, 
capped by Olloque's driving layup. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors led 31-28 at the half and 51-38 after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward Mary Litzenberg added 19 points and nine rebounds for the West 
Torrance. Carolyn Sumida came off the bench to add 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights' last gasp was a three-point play by Mirlen Martinez that cut the 
lead to 58-51. But they never got any closer, and West made seven free throws 
in the last 1:21 to seal the win. DAVID RAATZ

VALLEY ROLLS TO FOURTH STATE TOURNAMENT BID IN ROW

<P>
Some basketball programs devise unique little slogans during the season to 
inspire the team to achieve a goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley College women's basketball team doesn't have a slogan, a mascot, or 
even a huge following, but the Lady Monarchs continue to fulfill their highest 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
That goal is the junior college state tournament. For the fourth consecutive 
year Valley (29-5) will represent one of four Southern California teams in the 
tournament, thanks to a 76-52 win Saturday night over visiting Mt. San Antonio 
College in a Southern regional qualifying game. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams had trouble getting their offense going in a foul-plagued first half 
that saw 36 fouls called. 
</P>
<P>
The Mounties committed 20 turnovers and Valley took a 36-25 intermission lead 
by winning a free-throw contest (16 for 27). 
</P>
<P>
The referees let the teams play in the second half and the No. 2-seeded Valley 
went on an 11-0 run during a three-minute span midway in the half to put the 
game away. 
</P>
<P>
"The game involved a game of depth," Valley coach Doug Michelson said. "We have 
unmatched depth on our bench through all 14 players. It has helped us all 
season long but it really surfaced in tonight's game." 
</P>
<P>
Depth, indeed. Eleven of 13 Lady Monarchs who played in the game scored, with 
sophomore guard Christine Rumfola leading the way with a team-high 20 points 
and forward Sandrine Rocher adding 10. 
</P>
<P>
Valley also dominated the boards, outrebounding Mt. SAC, 57-38, and took 
advantage of 33 Mountie turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. San Antonio (21-10) was led by 6-2 center Kim Hansen, who had a game-high 
25 points in the Mounties' first-ever appearance in the Southern California 
Regional. 
</P>
<P>
The state tournament which begins Thursday at College of the Sequoias in 
Visalia will pit Valley, last year's state runner-up, and three other Southern 
California Regional winners from Saturday night's action against four teams 
from the northern qualifying region for the state championship. PAUL OLSON

At Brea-Olinda High, where the girls' basketball team counts its winning streak 
in the 50s these days, the question isn't whether the Lady Cats will win but by 
how much. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda, the top seeded-team in the Southern Section 3-AA Division 
playoffs, has yet to face a tough challenge in the postseason. And Saturday 
night was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda's victim this time was Alemany, winner of its previous 12 games. 
But when it was over, the Lady Cats were the ones with their winning streak -- 
now at 51 games -- still intact after a 72-43 victory at Esperanza High. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, Brea-Olinda, the 1989 3-A and state champion, advanced to the 
final, where it will meet Palos Verdes, a 62-48 winner over Estancia. 
</P>
<P>
"We're happy to be going back (to the title game)," Brea Coach Mark Trakh said. 
"We're real happy." 
</P>
<P>
You'd be happy, too, if your team was 29-0. The Lady Cats won their last 22 
games last season, giving them the second-longest winning streak in Southern 
Section history. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside Poly holds the record with 84 consecutive wins. 
</P>
<P>
Aimee McDaniel scored 22 points to lead the way Saturday. Jody Anton chipped in 
with 13 points and Allison Bickel had 13 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Bickel who had Trakh raving after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Allison had the game of her life," Trakh said. "She did a super job. She hit 
the boards and had a great game defensively." 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda's defense forced 18 turnovers and held Alemany to 12-of-44 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lady Cats relied on McDaniel's outside shooting (two three-point 
baskets) and driving layups and the inside play of Bickel and Anton. 
</P>
<P>
"We just kept pounding the ball inside," Trakh said. 
</P>
<P>
And in the first half, the Lady Cats were often pounded when they went inside. 
</P>
<P>
The second quarter turned out to be a free-throw shooting contest. Brea-Olinda 
made 10 of 15 free throws in the quarter while Alemany made seven of 11. 
</P>
<P>
The only basket scored in the final 3 minutes 27 seconds of the first half was 
Bickel's layup at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Cats led, 40-22, at halftime and by as many as 32 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Rachel Coretti scored 22 points for Alemany (20-7).

BELL WINS CITY TITLE AMID CONTROVERSY; 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER: FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW, A SEMIFINAL LOSER IS REINSTATED AND 
CLAIMS THE CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
What City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness hoped would be an isolated incident 
cropped up again this year, tarnishing the City Section championship soccer 
match. 
</P>
<P>
Bell High, acting on a tip from an undisclosed source, filed a complaint 
claiming Monroe had used ineligible players in a semifinal win last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
When Monroe was subsequently disqualified from Saturday's championship match at 
Birmingham High, Bell stepped in to defeat Kennedy, 1-0, and win its first City 
title. 
</P>
<P>
So for the second year in a row, the City soccer championship will carry an 
asterisk in the record books. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Palisades defeated San Pedro in the semifinals but was forced to 
forfeit after it was discovered a Dolphin player participated in an outside 
league. San Pedro was reinstated and beat Belmont for the title. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe players Oscar Rios and William Leal allegedly played on a club team 
during the high school season, a violation of an interscholastic rule that 
states that a player, between Nov. 15 and Feb. 15, may play for either a club 
team or a high school team but not for both. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my duty to uphold the rules, but I don't agree with it," Harkness said. 
"It's an administrative nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Bell Coach William Albano expressed similar sentiments. He said he was not 
interested in pursuing the incident but that he was given no choice after his 
school's assistant principal filed a complaint with the City Section's 
Interscholastic Athletics Council. 
</P>
<P>
"For the past 19 years I've been against this rule," Albano said. "It's hard 
for a coach to know where his players are on Sunday (when club teams play). 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lousy rule and I don't like it. But we have to abide by it." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (14-3-1) wore blue sweatbands in tribute to Monroe, but Bell wasn't 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
Bell (11-1-2) scored the only goal it needed with five minutes remaining in the 
first half. Kennedy goalkeeper Salvador Reyes appeared to have blocked Jorge 
Miranda's head shot off an Arnold Toscano cross pass, but the ball slipped from 
Reyes' hands into the upper-left corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy had two corner kicks in the closing minutes but could not convert. Five 
of the Golden Cougars' eight shots on goal were off target. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, the Southeastern Conference champion, totaled 10 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"(Bell) earned it. They beat us, 1-0," Kennedy Coach Fred Singer said. "They're 
the City champs. Whether it's a different game with Monroe or not doesn't make 
any difference." 
</P>
<P>
Monroe would offer a different opinion. Thirteen Viking players, waving their 
red game jerseys while watching from behind the Kennedy bench, stood by a 
banner that read, "Monroe beat Bell, 2-1," symbolic of their overtime victory 
at Bell on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
One Monroe player chanted, "We are the champions," after the final whistle.

CHAPMAN CAN'T GET OFF LAST SHOT IN 66-65 DEFEAT

Chapman College put itself out of its own misery without firing a shot Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing Cal Poly Pomona by one point with five seconds remaining, Chris Martin 
took an inbound pass, dribbled the length of the court, but couldn't manage a 
shot against a pressing defense and the Panthers wound up losing, 66-65, in a 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game at the Hutton Center. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Pomona (9-18 and 3-11 in conference) finished the season tied 
with Chapman (11-16, 3-11) for last place in the CCAA. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that our inconsistency of play -- quite good at times and very poor at 
other times -- is the reason we couldn't win that game," Chapman Coach Bob Boyd 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman shot 36.4% from the field, had 13 turnovers and trailed by six at 
halftime. And it appeared that the Panthers were ready to continue that way at 
the start of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman missed its first five shots from the field and the Broncos improved 
their lead to 15 with 16 minutes 25 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Panthers turned the game around and after going on a 12-0 run, 
took the lead, 54-52, on a three-point basket by Andre Hill with 7:17 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers twice held three-point leads but couldn't shake the Broncos, who 
regained the lead at 64-63 when Terry Ross scored following an offensive 
rebound with 2:30 left. 
</P>
<P>
Hill made two free throws to put Chapman ahead by one with 1:50 left. With 1:16 
left, Andrew Bojarski scored to give the Broncos a 66-65 lead. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning little went right for the Panthers, who turned the ball over 
on four of their first six possessions. Taking advantage, Pomona built a 9-6 
lead before the Broncos made four consecutive baskets and led, 17-6, with 11:30 
left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman battled back and closed within four points before Ross scored on a dunk 
in the last seconds of the half. 
</P>
<P>
Rog Middleton had 21 for Chapman. Middleton, a sophomore, finished the season 
with 550 points, moving him past Tom Cooke (547 in 1959-60) into third place on 
the Panthers' single-season scoring list.

CSUN TEAMS DO WELL ENOUGH;

<P>
COLLEGE TRACK: MEN, WOMEN RACK UP VICTORIES IN UNSPECTACULAR FOUR-SCHOOL MEET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Sometime in the spring -- early April, perhaps -- a California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. quadrangular track and field meet that included Cal State 
Northridge, Cal State Los Angeles, UC Riverside and Cal Poly Pomona would shape 
up as an exciting, high-quality affair. 
</P>
<P>
It is only late February, however, and predictably, the majority of the 
performances in Saturday's meet were lackluster. It was, in fact, the first 
competition of the season for many of Northridge's athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Although nobody threatened any records, the day was far from a complete loss: 
Northridge won both the men's and women's meets easily. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's meet, Northridge totaled 90.5 points, followed by Cal State L. A. 
(74.5), Riverside (20) and Pomona (16). 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors scored 106 points, while Cal State L. A. (53), Pomona (nine) 
and Riverside (seven) finished second, third and fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a decent start," Northridge Coach Don Strametz said. "I think we showed 
that we have a solid dual-meet team. We'll know more next week." 
</P>
<P>
That's when Northridge travels to UC Irvine for a triangular meet against the 
Anteaters and Stanford, both NCAA Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Albers was Northridge's top performer Saturday, winning the hammer throw 
and placing second in the discus. 
</P>
<P>
His toss of 186 feet 10 inches in the hammer easily qualified him for the 
Division II championships in Hampton, Va., in May. 
</P>
<P>
Albers placed sixth in last year's Division II meet. 
</P>
<P>
Lolita Pile, second in the triple jump in the 1989 Division II meet, won that 
event along with the long jump, and she also anchored the victorious 400-meter 
relay team. 
</P>
<P>
Pile leaped 18-2 1/2 in the long jump and 39-3 1/2 in the triple jump, then 
teamed with Shawnette Sapp, Charlotte Vines and Laural Isles for a 47.79 
clocking in the relay. 
</P>
<P>
Isles, runner-up in the 100 meters in last year's Division II meet, was second 
behind Vines (12.04-12.06 seconds) in that event Saturday but came back to win 
the 200 convincingly in 25.20. Vines was second in 25.72. 
</P>
<P>
The other top Northridge performance was turned in by Sasha Vujic, who won the 
men's 1,500 in 3:56.1. 
</P>
<P>
Vujic, eighth in the Division II cross-country championships in November, ran 
away from a field that included Shannon Winkleman of Riverside, who placed 
third in 3:59.4.

NO LATE HEROICS FOR NORTHRIDGE, 6-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Revenge was on the minds of many of the Cal State Dominguez Hills baseball 
players in Saturday's 6-5 win over visiting Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
It was especially so for George Scott: The Toros' center fielder had gone 
hitless in four at-bats the day before in a 10-9 loss to Northridge in a 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all kind of upset," said Scott of the loss, in which Northridge scored 
three runs to win in the bottom of the ninth on consecutive homers. "We wanted 
it today; we felt we owed it to them." 
</P>
<P>
Scott waited until the final inning Saturday to redeem himself. 
</P>
<P>
With two out and the score tied, 5-5, in the bottom of the 11th, Scott (two for 
six) smacked a line drive to left-center field to drive home Fred Camarena with 
the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena had reached second on a fielder's choice after Bill Keep was thrown 
out trying to advance from second to third. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge led, 5-4, going into the ninth, but the Matadors couldn't hold on. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena doubled home Eddie Luna, who had reached base on a walk and advanced 
to second on a sacrifice bunt, to tie the game. The Toros had a chance to win 
but Todd Denhart (2-2), who entered the game in the ninth in relief of starter 
Vale Lopez, retired the next two batters to send it into extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
"The games are going to be like this all year long," said Dominguez Hills Coach 
Bill Wing, as Northridge lost its first game in four tries in conference play. 
"It's a competitive conference and on any given day, anybody can win." 
</P>
<P>
Early in the game, it looked like it would be Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors built a 4-0 lead after three innings, scoring in each frame. In 
the first, Craig Clayton doubled to score Greg Shockey, who was hit by a pitch 
to open the game. Clayton later scored on Denny Vigo's single. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (8-6) also added runs in the second and third innings. Scott 
Richardson singled to score Mike Sims in the second and Scott Sharts scored on 
a sacrifice fly in the third. 
</P>
<P>
"We just self-destructed," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said. "We made too many 
mental errors and just shut down after the fourth inning." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, which had 10 hits, was held hitless in the last four. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills (5-1, 1-1) scored a run in the fourth and added three more in 
the sixth to tie the game, 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge went ahead in the seventh when Eric Johnson, who doubled to open the 
inning, scored on Clayton's single. 
</P>
<P>
In the 11th, Scott doubled off Denhart, whom he had struck out against twice in 
the Northridge victory on Friday when Denhart earned the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Fletcher earned the save for Dominguez Hills, pitching the final 4 2/3 
innings.

den West College gained its fourth consecutive berth in the state women's 
basketball tournament with a 130-80 victory over El Camino Saturday at Golden 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West (34-1) will enter the tournament, which begins Thursday at College 
of the Sequoias in Visalia, as the top-seeded team from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The victory marked the school-record sixth consecutive time the Rustlers have 
scored more than 100 points in a game. It was also the school-record 13th time 
in a season that the Rustlers have scored more than 100 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we made it again," Golden West Coach Dick Stricklin said. "We knew it 
was going to be a run-and-gun game because that's what they like to do as much 
as we do." 
</P>
<P>
Golden West had defeated Antelope Valley, 115-61, in the first round of the 
playoffs Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West led, 61-44, after a physical first half Saturday; the Rustlers' 
Shawna Armstrong had to leave the game in the first minute when she was hit in 
the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong returned six minutes later and finished with a team-high 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
Her substitute, Micki Hamilton, scored a team-high 16 points in the first half 
and finished with 21. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Gondringer added 21 points and Claudette Jackson 16 for Golden West. 
</P>

BALL BOUNCES RIGHT FOR USIU IN VICTORY OVER UCSD, 93-91

<P>
Gary Zarecky, U.S. International coach, and UC San Diego Coach Tom Marshall had 
their eyes fixed on the bouncing ball as the final seconds ticked away in their 
nonconference men's basketball game at Golden Hall Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
And, boy, did that ball bounce. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD, ranked No. 15 in NCAA Division III, had outplayed the Division I Gulls 
most of the night and -- despite a furious USIU rally -- had the ball for one 
last shot with 42 seconds remaining and the score tied, 91-91. 
</P>
<P>
The Tritons worked the ball around and with eight seconds left, got it to the 
man they wanted: Tim Rapp. But USIU's Mitch Brown poked the ball out of his 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
The ball, followed by a herd of players, got to about midcourt when Kevin 
Bradshaw was able to get a hand on it and lob it to Demetrius Laffitte, who 
picked it out of the air in front of an outstretched hand of a UCSD player and 
scored with two seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
USIU 93, UCSD 91. 
</P>
<P>
"It was good to see one go our way," Zarecky said with a sigh of relief. "We 
lost three games at the buzzer this year." 
</P>
<P>
It looked as if the Gulls were going to lose this one long before the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
USIU pulled out to a, 31-21, lead midway through the first half. But over the 
next seven minutes the Gulls (11-16) managed just two points -- those coming on 
a one-handed slam by Bradshaw. The Tritons, meanwhile, scored 21 points during 
that stretch and led 42-33. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD led, 45-39, at the half and pulled out to a 12-point lead in the second 
half -- the last one being, 70-58, with 11:23 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
USIU rallied with a 17-4 run and took a 75-74 lead on a three-pointer by Brown 
with 7:55 left. 
</P>
<P>
The lead bounced back and forth and Steve Smith scored on a driving layup with 
1:18 left to give USIU a 91-89 lead. Rick Batt hit two free throws with 56 
seconds remaining to tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
USIU took the ball up court, but Bradshaw was called for a five-second 
violation and the Tritons (20-6) got the ball back. But Rapp got cornered and 
USIU forced the turnover. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were going to get it back," Marshall said. "But the ball bounced 
their way." 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw and Rapp finished with 31 points apiece. Paul Wilson added 23 for USIU 
and Laffitte had 19 points and 12 rebounds. Batt, who had just three points at 
the half, finished with 22 and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Tritons are hoping the loss wasn't their season finale. UCSD will wait to 
see if it will be included in the NCAA Division III national tournament for the 
first time. The tournament pairings will be decided today. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls conclude their season at home Saturday against Akron.

As if negotiating eight turns and two dozen jumps over the third-mile of real 
estate they call a "Chunk of Baja" wasn't enough of a challenge, drivers in the 
Mickey Thompson Off-Road Championship Gran Prix Saturday night had to choose 
between two lanes on the inner portion of the track at San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The track, one of the longest and widest on the 10-stop Mickey Thompson series, 
offered drivers an option on the third turn -- inside or outside -- before 
converging back into one lane some 200 yards later. 
</P>
<P>
They call it a dual-lane track, and unlike other endeavors -- such as 
track-and-field or business -- the inside track is not always the most 
advantageous. 
</P>
<P>
Grand National Sport Truck drivers, the marquee performers of the Mickey 
Thompson circuit, found the outside strip to be the faster road to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside's Walker Evans used it to win the Grand National main event over 
Alpine's Ivan Stewart. Evans, 51, and Stewart, 44, were the oldest drivers in 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Mears Jr. finished third and father Roger Mears Sr. was fifth. Dan 
Essingler, the winner of heat No. 2, finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
On the other end of the age spectrum, Jeremy McGrath of Sun City, one of the 
youngest racers at 18, won UltraCross Pro Motorcycle class ahead of Escondido's 
Ryan Hughes, even younger at 16. 
</P>
<P>
In the Super 1600, Greg George of Colton defeated points leader Frank Arciero 
Jr. of Laguna Hills. Arciero, who became the all-time main event winner in the 
Mickey Thompson series with victory No. 14 at the season-opener in Anaheim, 
came within a car length of George at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the size of the Super 1600s, Arciero was concerned about taking the 
lead early. "If one of the fast guys start up front, I can see him running away 
with it," Arciero said beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
Said George, "Arciero is always tough, and one thing you can't do is give him 
an edge." 
</P>
<P>
In the UltraStock main, Jeff Elrod of San Jose took an early lead and 
maintained it through the checkered flag. Vincent Tjelmeland, the winner of 
heat of No. 2, was second and Kent Castle third. Elrod, tied for third in 
points entering the evening emerged as the overall points leader because Tim 
Lewis, who was leading, finished eighth, and Larry Noel, who was second, was 
11th. 
</P>
<P>
In the Superlites (formerly known as Odysseys), Holgeir Oksnevad of Durand, 
Ill., took the checkered flag over John Gersjes of South Gate and Edward Moore 
of Garden Grove. Moore, who won the first heat, took the overall points lead 
from Lakeside's Frank Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez's teammate on the Mike Lovelle Racing Team, El Cajon's Ron Pierce, won 
the first heat. 
</P>
<P>
Donny Banks of Macon, Ga., won the Four-Wheel ATV main ahead of Gary Denton of 
Chino and Charles Shepherd of Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the event started by the late Mickey Thompson 10 years ago, 
these events are not just for the racers, as most of the 43,162 that attended 
Saturday night would confirm. 
</P>
<P>
A 1 1/2-hour autograph session, allowing fans onto the track for a closeup view 
of their favorite racers, was held before the racing program. 
</P>
<P>
Then, during the opening ceremonies, the Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group -- 
perhaps influenced by the Major Indoor Soccer League All-Star game this week at 
the Sports Arena -- had the points leader of each vehicle division introduced. 
</P>
<P>
The likes of Alpine's Ivan Stewart and Lakeside's Frank Chavez came roaring out 
of the stadium tunnel and onto the track for a trial lap amid dimmed lights, 
spotlights and fireworks spewing from the ground, then negotiated the various 
jumps.

PADRES PROMOTE SWANSON TO MEDIA DIRECTOR 
</P>

<P>
Jerry Kapstein, wasting no time in making changes in the Padre front office, 
Saturday promoted Mike Swanson to director of media relations. 
</P>
<P>
It's Kapstein's first move since he was named Thursday by Padre owner Joan Kroc 
to oversee the daily operations of the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Sources have said Kapstein will continue making employee evaluations upon his 
return to town Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Those expected to be most closely evaluated are President Dick Freeman; Bill 
Adams, executive director of ticket sales and operations; Jim Winters, director 
of broadcasting; Andy Strasberg, director of marketing, and Chuck Gelman, vice 
president of communications. The five executives earn a total of more than 
$700,000, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson, 35, assistant director of media relations since 1984, fills the 
vacancy left by Bill Beck in January when Beck became administrative assistant 
to Jack McKeon, manager and vice president/baseball operations. 
</P>
<P>
"He's in the top of his field," Beck said of Swanson. "There's certainly no 
better stat man I've ever been around." 
</P>
<P>
Swanson, who attended the University of Kansas, previously worked for the 
Kansas City Royals, ABC and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
He was the statistician for a CBS radio crew, including Padre broadcaster Jerry 
Coleman, that covered the 1984 All-Star game in San Francisco. Coleman returned 
to San Diego raving about his new acquaintance, and a month later, Beck 
requested Swanson's assistance in preparing the post-season media guide. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the World Series was over, Bill asked me if I'd stay," Swanson said. 
"Even though I loved by job with CBS working mostly football and basketball, I 
knew all along baseball was my first love, and what better place than this?"

15 YEARS LATER, DICKENS OF CASE NEAR TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
OIL: SOME WITNESSES HAVE DIED, OTHERS MAY NOT REMEMBER DETAILS. BUT A SUIT 
CHARGING SIX COMPANIES WITH FIXING PRICES IS CLOSE TO TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifteen years after Long Beach accused six major oil companies of price-fixing, 
it appears that the case, which could change the way oil is bought and sold in 
California, is finally on its way to trial. But unlike fine wine and good 
cheese, both sides agree, lawsuits do not improve with age. 
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses who lined up to testify when the case was filed in 1975 are 
dead. So is at least one lawyer. Some of the witnesses still living are in 
their 80s and may have, in the words of one lawyer, "lost it." And even the 
sharpest witness would be hard-pressed to recall the details of meetings held 
when John F. Kennedy was President. 
</P>
<P>
"We call this the 'Jarndyce case' -- from the Dickens story 'Bleak House,' 
about a case that goes on so long no one remembers what it's about," said Brian 
McMahon, one of the attorneys representing Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The huge antitrust suit, believed to be one of the longest ever to crawl 
through the justice system, accuses the Chevron Corp., Exxon Corp., Mobil Oil 
Corp., Shell Oil Co., Texaco Inc. and Union Oil Co. of California of conspiring 
to hold down the price of crude pumped out of the Wilmington oil field that 
extends into Long Beach Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles federal court judge ruled in 1985 that the city's evidence 
against the oil companies was too soft. Last year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court 
of Appeals said the oil giants appeared to act "in conscious parallel" and 
ordered the case to trial. Last week, the highest court in the land agreed, a 
victory for a city that has waited so long to go to court, it is no longer sure 
where all of its witnesses live. 
</P>
<P>
"Or if they're even alive, frankly," McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
When the case was filed, McMahon was in law school. His son, born one month 
before the city's case, is now a freshman in high school, and a trial date 
still is not set. 
</P>
<P>
The city and the state -- which eventually joined in the lawsuit -- allege that 
oil company executives met in their various Los Angeles offices during 1961 and 
1962 and agreed to pay about 90 cents a barrel less for Wilmington crude than 
the going market price. 
</P>
<P>
One problem is most of those executives were near retirement even then. 
</P>
<P>
One of the city's most important witnesses -- an Exxon executive who had been 
prepared to testify against the oil company's practices -- died a few years 
ago, McMahon said. His deposition -- statements taken under oath outside the 
courtroom -- are all that remain and will probably be read to the jury by an 
attorney, McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no substitute for putting a real live person in front of a jury," he 
lamented. 
</P>
<P>
Time hasn't been much kinder to the oil companies, which stand to lose $800 
million if the city prevails, according to Chevron's San Francisco attorney, 
Anthony P. Brown, who today has five grandchildren he did not have when he took 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
One of Brown's original witnesses was Chevron's chairman of the board, who 
decided what price the company should pay for oil. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, now he's dead," Brown said. "He was absolutely a marvelous witness, a 
gracious individual. The jury would have loved him, and he denied that the 
defendants conspired to depress the price of crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to read to the jury what he said. It will probably put the jury to 
sleep, and they'll miss it. A thing like that could make or break a case." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers expect the trial to begin next fall, not the most opportune time for 
oil companies, with the Alaska and Orange County oil spills still fresh in the 
minds of prospective jurors, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"Keep in mind we're defending the petroleum industry," he said, "and every time 
one of them knocks the bottom out of a tanker ship, it doesn't help us. Oil 
companies are not popular." 
</P>
<P>
The city, which acts as trustee for the state for most offshore oil, is 
claiming $280 million in lost profits. Antitrust cases allow for treble 
damages, bringing the total potential winnings to $840 million. 
</P>
<P>
But with inflation since 1975, even if the city wins it all, 840 million 1990 
dollars amount to less than a third of the city's initial losses, McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
"A businessman could look at this and say price-fixing is worthwhile, because 
we won't have to repay much of what we made," he said. "That is the real sad 
thing about all this taking so long." 
</P>
<P>
And why did it take so long? 
</P>
<P>
"The defendants procrastinated at all points. It took some oil companies more 
than a year to produce documents," McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
"That is absolute nonsense and kind of disgusting," Brown shot back. "It spent 
five years in the appeal process, and not a minute of that was caused by any 
tactics by the defense." 
</P>
<P>
Adversaries for years, you might think the two attorneys would at least agree 
on the old saw, "justice delayed is justice denied." 
</P>
<P>
They don't. 
</P>
<P>
Said McMahon: "Oh yes, absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
Said Brown: "I'll tell you after the trial."

CHILDREN GET TASTE OF CLASSICAL MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was fortunate in being able to join 3,000 schoolchildren and their teachers 
at the young people's concert performed by the Long Beach Symphony Orchestra. A 
sea of youngsters from fourth grade to eighth grade filled the spacious 
approach to the elegant Terrace Theatre with its fountain of "dancing waters," 
looking on, eagerly waiting for the doors to open. 
</P>
<P>
When they were finally admitted, they quickly filed in and took their assigned 
seats by school. The music director and conductor, JoAnn Falletta, appeared, 
and the children were ushered into a strange, new, exciting world of classical 
music. 
</P>
<P>
Falletta had wisely selected the musical numbers on a theme that children could 
readily relate to: "Classical Music in the Movies." With the increased use of 
classical music as scores in films, she was able to make some fine selections, 
such as Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries" from the film "Apocalypse (Now)," some 
Mozart music from "Amadeus," Pachelbel's "Canon" from "Ordinary People," and of 
course, John Williams' score to "Star Wars." The music was reinforced with 
visuals from the films. 
</P>
<P>
It was obvious that for the children, it was a totally new experience. 
Arriving, they were in awe of the huge, well-appointed auditorium. They were 
intrigued by the orchestra's tuning up. 
</P>
<P>
And then the music. It evidently got to them. The children responded. Whereas 
they were subdued listening to the serene, sad music of Pachelbel's "Canon," 
they were overwhelmed by the fury of Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries." And 
scores of children's arms began flaying as they "conducted" the rhythmic 
"Scheherazade" of Rimsky-Korsakov. The children were indeed receptive. For an 
audience of 3,000 youngsters to show such discipline at their first music 
encounter was remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to commend Falletta for introducing this marvelous outreach 
program, and the Long Beach Symphony Assn., which together with the Long Beach 
Unified School District made it possible for a total of 12,000 students to 
attend these two-day concerts. For too long our children have been deprived of 
an adequate music education. In the general retrenchment of school funding, and 
in the emphasis on the "three Rs" and computers, the creative arts have been 
sorely neglected. This new program is a wonderful beginning. It is also a sound 
investment, that of preparing a future audience for classical music. Our 
children's education is not complete without music.

BELLFLOWER COUNCIL OKS STREET BARRIER TO CURB DRUG TRAFFICKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

BELLFLOWER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved installing a temporary traffic barrier in an 
effort to curb drug trafficking in a Bellflower neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously to place orange traffic cones at the intersection 
of Eucalyptus Avenue and Alondra Boulevard to prevent cars traveling on Alondra 
from turning south at Eucalyptus. 
</P>
<P>
Eucalyptus south of Alondra will still be accessible from Flora Vista Street. 
</P>
<P>
Although neighbors have said they would like to see the street barricaded 
completely, Mayor John Ansdell said merchants in a nearby shopping center would 
suffer if the street were closed. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have argued that anyone who breaks the law to sell drugs would not be 
afraid to drive through the barrier on Eucalyptus. 
</P>
<P>
Ansdell said Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies will strictly enforce the 
new traffic regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a temporary measure to see if we can stop the drug trafficking," 
Ansdell said. "It's a start."

<P>
GOLF: HE HAS 10 BIRDIES IN RECORD-TYING ROUND AT RIVIERA AND HE SHATTERS THE 
54-HOLE TOURNAMENT MARK WITH A 197. BUT MORGAN AND MEDIATE AREN'T FAR BEHIND.

<P>
Fred Couples has been successful on the PGA Tour, a player who is often in 
contention and high on the money-winning list. 
</P>
<P>
However, as skilled as he is, it's generally believed that he hasn't always 
played to his potential. 
</P>
<P>
Couples reached that potential and then some Saturday at the Nissan Los Angeles 
Open at the Riviera Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
He tied the course record with a nine-under-par 62 to take a two-stroke lead 
into today's final round. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, his 54-hole total of 197, 16 under par, set an L.A. Open record for 
three rounds. Chip Beck held the previous record at 199 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
With many in a crowd of 35,650 cheering him on, Couples finished with a 
flourish. 
</P>
<P>
His seven-iron second shot on the 447-yard 18th hole landed only two feet from 
the cup. 
</P>
<P>
"That was fantastic," said the 30-year-old Couples, who then tapped in for his 
10th birdie of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Couples started the day four strokes behind Michael Allen, the second-round 
leader, but he made up ground in a hurry with six birdies on the front nine 
along with one bogey. 
</P>
<P>
He had four more birdies on the back nine to tie the course record set by Larry 
Mize in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best I've ever played for three rounds," said Couples, who is 
known as Boom-Boom for his length off the tee. 
</P>
<P>
Riviera has been a fast track for the pros this week because of the warm 
weather, gentle breezes and with the greens holding shots. 
</P>
<P>
So sub-par rounds are routine. Rocco Mediate, 27, and Gil Morgan, 43, a 
two-time L.A. Open champion, will be playing in the final group with Couples 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Mediate, shooting for his first tour victory, shot a four-under par 67. Morgan 
had a 65. They're at 199, tying Beck's 54-hole record that was broken by 
Couples. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, who held the lead for 36 holes, got off to a shaky start when his tee 
shot on the par-five, 501-yard first hole landed out of bounds on the top of a 
hospitality tent. 
</P>
<P>
He got a double bogey on the hole, but recovered to shoot a one-over-par 72. 
Nonetheless, he's at 203, one stroke behind Hale Irwin (64) and Hal Sutton (67) 
and six back of Couples. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just one of those days," said Couples, who lived in Newport Beach for a 
while, but now makes his home in Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it was a flawless round, but every time I looked up the ball 
was going where I looked," he said. "Obviously, I know I can't shoot 62 
tomorrow, but I need to play well and that's all I'll be thinking about." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Mediate nor Morgan were surprised that Couples shot a 62, saying that 
he's capable of it. 
</P>
<P>
For all of his talent, though, Couples has only three tour victories in nine 
years, the last coming in the Byron Nelson tournament in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
However, he has been a member of the Ryder Cup team, had five top-10 finishes 
in 1989 and has earned $1.7 million the past three years on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
Couples said Friday that he doubted that anyone would shoot a score as low as 
63, which Allen did in the first round Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
So Couples came back with a 62, which he said was his best competitive round. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why," said Couples. "However, it's the best I've ever hit my 
irons and I don't believe the pins were as tough (placement) as they were the 
first two days." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to describe his birdie on the 18th hole, which is uphill and is regarded 
as one of the most demanding finishing holes on the tour, Couples said: 
</P>
<P>
"My drive landed in the first cut of the rough and I had a good lie and was 156 
yards away. The pin was on line with trees. I hit it just enough to catch the 
green and it spun sideways down toward the pin. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the shot I was trying to hit, but it was a fluke that it was two feet 
away." 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing fluky, though, about his round. And if he shoots 66 or better 
today, he will break the 72-hole L.A. Open record of 264 set by Lanny Wadkins 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the high expectations for him, Couples said: "A few times my mind 
hasn't been in it, but most of the time my golf is as strong as my game will 
let me play." 
</P>
<P>
Couples and Morgan have been in contention on the final day in other years. For 
Mediate, it's a relatively new experience. 
</P>
<P>
He was in the final group at Pebble Beach recently, but faltered by shooting a 
77 in a tournament won by Mark O'Meara. 
</P>
<P>
"Today was a huge test for me," Mediate said. "If you shoot a high score, 
you're gone. Now I have a chance, but I was nervous on the first tee." 
</P>
<P>
Mediate stumbled, though, on the 413-yard 12th hole, where he took a double 
bogey. 
</P>
<P>
But he recovered quickly -- and spectacularly -- on the next hole, a par-four 
measuring 420 yards. His five-iron second shot from 176 yards away took one 
bounce on the green and rolled into the cup for an eagle. 
</P>
<P>
"I took an extra club, choked down and hit it as hard I can and it went in, " 
Mediate said. "It surprised me." 
</P>
<P>
He then got two birdies on the last five holes to finish with his 67. 
</P>
<P>
Mediate said his 14-under-par score for three rounds is his best showing in his 
five years on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I want to feel," he said. "I'm having fun and I'm looking forward 
to the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Five players were grouped at 204 -- Peter Persons, Tom Sieckmann, Corey Pavin, 
Peter Jacobsen and Tony Sills. Mark Calcavecchia, the defending champion, is at 
208 after shooting 69 Saturday. . . . Pat Fitzsimons, who won the L.A. Open in 
1975, was in contention Thursday with a 66. Since, he's had a 76 and 67 and is 
at 209. . . . Fred Couples, playing in the L.A. Open for the 10th time, 
considers it a must stop for him on the tour. He finished seventh in last 
year's tournament, five strokes behind Calcavecchia.

TONY CONIGLIARO DIES; BEANING CUT CAREER SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight years after suffering a massive heart attack that incapacitated him, 
former Boston Red Sox outfielder Tony Conigliaro is dead at age 45. 
</P>
<P>
He died at Salem Hospital, north of Boston, Saturday afternoon of kidney 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
Conigliaro suffered the heart attack on Jan. 9, 1982, while riding with his 
brother Billy to Logan Airport in Boston. Doctors said Conigliaro's brain was 
deprived of oxygen for 14 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
He remained in a coma for weeks, and has required constant care since. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the heart attack, Conigliaro was on his way back to Los Angeles 
after visiting his family in Boston during the Christmas holidays. 
</P>
<P>
He had been living in Los Angeles and working as a sports agent for Dennis 
Gilbert, whose company, now handles such stars as Bret Saberhagen and Jose 
Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on the next plane to Boston," said Gilbert Saturday night, recalling 
when he learned of the heart attack. "Tony C was one of my best friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I made the trip back to Boston a number of times over the next few years to 
see him, but it just got to me after a while, and I quit going. 
</P>
<P>
"I would talk to him, but he couldn't respond." 
</P>
<P>
Younger brother Richie Conigliaro said two years ago that Tony talked at times. 
"He can talk when he's in the mood," he said. "He sees a speech therapist. 
Sometimes I ask him how he feels and he says, 'Good.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, who also played for the Boston organization, said he met Conigliaro in 
1968 when both were playing in the Winter Instructional League in Sarasota, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert was a prospect out of Gardena High School, while Conigliaro was 
attempting a comeback after being hit in the head by a pitch from Angel pitcher 
Jack Hamilton on Aug. 18, 1967. 
</P>
<P>
The beaning ended up ruining a promising career. 
</P>
<P>
Conigliaro, signed by the Red Sox in 1962 and given a $20,000 signing bonus, 
made it to the majors two years later. He hit .290 and had 24 homers his rookie 
season. He hit .269 and had 32 homers the next year, and by the time he was 22, 
he had 100 career homers, making him the youngest player to reach that total. 
</P>
<P>
The beaning broke his left cheekbone, dislocated his jaw, and resulted in 
20/300 vision. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1968, physicians were surprised to find Conigliaro's vision had 
improved to 20/100. He began working out and later that year the Red Sox sent 
him to Sarasota. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, he batted .255, hit 20 home runs and drove in 82 runs. He hit .266 
with 36 homers and 116 runs batted in in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
However, Conigliaro and Red Sox Manager Dick Williams weren't getting along, so 
Conigliaro was traded after the 1970 season to the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
But his eyesight worsened and he never again was the same ballplayer. He played 
in only 74 games in 1971, hitting .222, before going on the disabled list in 
July. He retired at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
He attempted a comeback in 1975 with the Red Sox, and hit two home runs in 21 
games before retiring for good. 
</P>
<P>
He went to work as a sportscaster, first in Providence, R.I., and later in San 
Francisco, at KGO-TV. 
</P>
<P>
"He was under a lot of stress after that job in San Francisco," Gilbert said. 
"That's when he was working for me. 
</P>
<P>
"He had been prescribed blood-pressure medication, but he didn't like to take 
it." 
</P>
<P>
He was a front-runner among applicants for a Red Sox commentating job in 1982 
before suffering the heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, when not hospitalized, he lived with his brother in Nahant, north 
of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
A number of benefits were held to help pay for his round-the-clock care, which 
cost more than $100,000 per year, according to Billy Conigliaro. 
</P>
<P>
One of the benefits, held at Boston's Symphony Hall, featured Frank Sinatra, 
Dionne Warwick and Marvin Hamlisch. It raised $230,000. 
</P>
<P>
Still, money was always a problem, particularly in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said the limit on Conigliaro's major league medical insurance was 
$225,000. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert and attorney Dale Gibrow were able to obtain another $225,000 in 
workmen's compensation in 1985, but $37,500 of that went for legal fees and 
other costs. 
</P>
<P>
Conigliaro's father, Salvatore, died two years ago after suffering a heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad story, a really sad story," Gilbert said. 
</P>

UCLA SKID EXTENDED TO FIVE GAMES; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: BRUINS WASTE SEVEN-POINT LEAD IN SECOND HALF AND LOSE AT 
OREGON STATE, 83-74. IT'S THEIR WORST SLUMP IN 42 YEARS.

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA's Forgettable February ended Saturday before 10,400 in Gill Coliseum, 
where a banner unfurled before the game by Oregon State students spelled out 
what has become painfully obvious to the Bruins: 
</P>
<P>
"U 
</P>
<P>
"Can 
</P>
<P>
"Lose 
</P>
<P>
"Again." 
</P>
<P>
An 83-74 loss to Oregon State was UCLA's fifth in a row and sixth in its last 
seven Pacific 10 Conference games. The Bruins are 16-9 overall and fifth in the 
conference at 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA hadn't lost five consecutive games since the 1947-48 season, when it lost 
six in a row and was 12-13 under Coach Wilbur Johns. Johns was replaced before 
the next season by a little-known coach from Indiana, John Wooden. 
</P>
<P>
After taking a seven-point lead in the second half, the Bruins went scoreless 
for almost eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The capacity crowd had come to see Gary Payton's final home game and celebrate 
a brilliant career, but for the first 27 1/2 minutes, the All-American guard 
was overshadowed by UCLA's Don MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
With 12:33 left, UCLA led, 64-57. MacLean had scored 28 of his game-high 32 
points and Payton, who missed 10 consecutive shots at one point, had not scored 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"We were playing well," UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
But that soon changed. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins missed their next eight shots, made four turnovers and were 
outscored, 13-0, by the Beavers, who used the momentum to improve to 21-4 and 
14-2 in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
And the Bruins stopped going to MacLean, to the consternation of Harrick. 
</P>
<P>
"Run the offense," Harrick screamed at Trevor Wilson after the Bruin forward 
drove around a defender but stepped over the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was quickly replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when point guard Darrick Martin missed an off-balance, running jump shot 
in the lane, Harrick stared him down. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was pulled, too. 
</P>
<P>
"When the game's on the line, I want to run our offense and not go 
one-one-one," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean, who ended the Bruins' drought by making a jump shot off an inbounds 
play, touched the ball only twice in the last 12 1/2 minutes and Payton 
eventually took over, scoring 12 of the Beavers' last 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scoring pretty easily on these guys today," said MacLean, who followed a 
31-point game at Oregon Thursday night by making 11 of 15 shots and all 10 of 
his free throws. "I wish I'd gotten the ball more down the stretch, but it's 
nobody's fault. I just didn't get it." 
</P>
<P>
Harrick might not agree. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Beavers did nothing special to shut down MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
Who was guarding him? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even know," MacLean said. "I had no trouble scoring all day long, so I 
probably should have made myself more available to get the ball. It was 
probably my fault more than anybody else's." 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State took a 24-12 lead, outscoring the Bruins, 18-6, and Harrick was 
unable to mask his frustration. 
</P>
<P>
His face reddened and he screamed at Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Martin yelled back. 
</P>
<P>
Enraged again minutes later, Harrick shouted at Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson shouted back. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, kneeling in front of the Bruin bench, Harrick stared down at the floor 
and screamed into the wood. 
</P>
<P>
No response. 
</P>
<P>
Behind MacLean, who made six of eight shots and scored 18 points in the first 
half, UCLA rallied to cut its deficit to 40-39 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
In its 13-0 run, Oregon State's scoring was distributed among five players, 
including Payton, whose jump shot from the lane with 5:59 left ended his 
0-for-10 shooting drought and gave the Beavers a 70-64 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Payton then scored the Beavers' next eight points, six on a pair of three-point 
plays, as Oregon State maintained its advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"Normal game, normal day," said Payton, who made seven of 18 shots. "I just did 
what I had to do. At one point, I was struggling. What I had to do was settle 
down and get my game going. And that's what I did." 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State made 58.3% of its shots in the second half, 47.5% overall and was 
the fifth consecutive team to outshoot UCLA. The Bruins, who shot 43.9%, were 
outshot only three times in their first 20 games. . . . Trevor Wilson took 15 
rebounds, one short of a career high, in 29 minutes. . . . Will Brantley, who 
missed two games with a sprained ankle, came off the bench and scored 14 points 
in 30 minutes for Oregon State, making nine of 11 shots. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Jim Harrick, on the Bruins' chances of making the NCAA tournament: 
"I'm not worried about that. Yeah, I am. I'd like to go. But I worry about our 
team playing well and I'm pleased with the way we played this weekend. We 
didn't win, but at least we played with intensity." . . . Said Oregon State 
Coach Jim Anderson of the Bruins: "I know they're a good enough team to play in 
the NCAA (tournament). They have the talent and the ability to be among the top 
64 teams, without a doubt." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA was 5-7 on the road this season and is 12-13 on the road in two seasons 
under Harrick. . . . Oregon State has won nine of its last 11 games against 
UCLA in Corvallis. . . . On the two-game trip: Don MacLean made 23 of 38 shots, 
17 of 18 free throws, scored 63 points and took 23 rebounds; Wilson made 10 of 
23 shots, two of five free throws, scored 22 points and took 21 rebounds. . . . 
Tracy Murray had five points, the first time in 11 games as UCLA's starting 
center that he has failed to reach double figures. . . . At this point last 
season, UCLA was 18-7 overall and 12-4 in the Pac-10.

NEWSWIRE: CHIEFS: WILL PLAY RAMS IN WEST GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams apparently will play an exhibition game against the Kansas City Chiefs 
in West Germany on the weekend of Aug. 11-12 at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs had been scheduled to play the New England Patriots in London in 
early August, but Carl Peterson, the Chiefs' president and general manager, 
said the team instead will play the Rams in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Although Peterson said everything but the exact site and date of game seems to 
be set, members of the Rams office staff were unaware of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew there had been discussions between the league, (Chief owner) Lamar Hunt 
and Mrs. Frontiere," said Pete Donovan, the Rams' director of sales. "But as of 
the end of the working day Friday, nothing was final."

PAC-10 SWIMMING CHAMPIONSHIPS;

<P>
EVANS KEYS STANFORD TO BIG LEAD OVER CAL

The Stanford women's swim team continued to dominate the Pacific 10 women's 
swimming and diving championships, winning five of seven events Saturday night 
at East Los Angeles College. Stanford extended its lead over California to 
1,160-858. UCLA is third at 782 points, followed by Arizona State with 700. USC 
is fifth with 569. 
</P>
<P>
After Stanford won the 200-yard medley relay, freshmen Janet Evans, Janel 
Jorgensen, and Lori Heisick led the Cardinal by winning three of the first four 
individual events. 
</P>
<P>
Evans caught teammate Michelle Griglione at the 150-yard mark of the 400-yard 
individual medley and went on to win in a meet record of 4:15.26. Lorenza Munoz 
of California was second, and Griglione was third. All three were under the 
NCAA qualifying standard. 
</P>
<P>
Although Evans trailed in the beginning, she never worried. 
</P>
<P>
"I've swum so many 400 I.M.'s against Michelle I wasn't worried," said Evans, 
who won three gold medals at the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Jorgensen joined Connors and Evans as double winners when she won the 100-yard 
butterfly. Jorgensen, who was on the 1988 Olympic team with Evans, led from the 
beginning, finishing well under the qualifying mark with a time of 54.33. 
Kristin Stoudt of UCLA was second and Terri O'Loughlin of USC was third. 
</P>
<P>
Cal junior Sarah Anderson stopped Stanford's winning streak with a victory in 
the 200-yard freestyle. Andersen, who caught and passed Jeanne Gibbons of UCLA 
at the halfway point, set a meet record with a time of 1:47.83. Gibbons held on 
for second place, followed by Anna Hansen of USC. The top two qualified for the 
NCAA championships, which will be held March 15-17 at the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Heisick concluded the Stanford freshman triple by winning the 100-yard 
breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
In the final individual event of the session, Kristin Kuhlman of California 
swam away from the field with an NCAA qualifying time of 56.87. Sherri White of 
USC was second. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford ended the night with a victory in the 800-yard freestyle relay. The 
Cardinal foursome of Jody Smith, Evans, Karen Kraemer, and Jorgensen swam a 
national leading time of 7:18.79. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA and USC continued to swim well, despite Stanford's dominance. 
</P>
<P>
"We picked up three more qualifiers today and a relay that will seed us very 
high at NCAAs," Bruin Coach Cyndi Gallagher said. "Point-wise we're not getting 
better, but more people are swimming faster." 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans did not add any more qualifiers, but Coach Darrell Fick was 
impressed with his team's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Our unshaved swimmers are swimming their best unshaved times of the season, 
and I think we are a couple of tenths (of a second) away from an exceptional 
meet," Fick said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pac-10 diving championships, being held at USC, Stanford senior Katie 
Connors defeated Arizona State's Janae Lautenschlager, 481.95-472.10, in the 
women's three-meter springboard. USC's Brian Earley defeated UCLA's Chris 
Dudka, 547.00-499.05, to win the men's one-meter springboard title.

Darryl Usher, a reserve wide receiver and kick returner for the San Diego 
Chargers and Phoenix Cardinals last season, was shot to death at his apartment 
in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Police said a man entered Usher's apartment and shot and killed Usher and 
Chiquita Burt, 24, believed to be Usher's girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
The attacker, who was not identified, is in critical condition after apparently 
turning the gun on himself. He is believed to have been a former boyfriend of 
Burt. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-8, 170-pound Usher was signed as a free agent by the Cardinals last 
November after being released by the Chargers. He was not protected by the 
Cardinals Feb. 1 and became an unconditional free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Usher, a second-year pro out of Illinois, was drafted in 1988 in seventh-round 
by the Patriots.

ANDREWS, UCLA WOMEN DOMINATE INVITATIONAL 
</P>

<P>
Given the competition, Saturday night's UCLA-Los Angeles Times Women's 
Gymnastics Invitational went pretty much as expected. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, ranked seventh in the nation, won with a meet-record score of 
191.45. 
</P>
<P>
And their star gymnast, Jill Andrews, with one of the strongest performances of 
her career before 4,358 at Pauley Pavilion, added another individual all-around 
title to her resume. 
</P>
<P>
The only legitimate competitor in the four-team meet, No. 12 Cal State 
Fullerton, finished second at 187.95. No. 20 Penn State and New Mexico posted 
respective scores of 187.00 and 184.20. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-2 Andrews, an All-American with four individual titles in six meets 
this season, stole the show. She was nearly perfect, winning all events except 
the bars competition, which went to Fullerton's Heather Thomas with a 
meet-record score of 9.80. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my last year and I want to go out in good form," explained Andrews, a 
senior whose intense concentration is one of the reasons she was recruited by 
Coach Jerry Tomlinson four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Said Tomlinson: "When I saw the look in her eye, I said I want that kid." 
</P>
<P>
And now that kid from Cupertino, Calif., could end up leading the Bruins to a 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Her scores Saturday night: a meet-record 9.95 on the vault, a 9.60 on the bars, 
9.70 on the beam and 9.80 on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Her chances of winning the floor competition improved when the Bruins' Kim 
Hamilton, a three-time NCAA individual floor champion, sprained her toe and 
arch warming up for the final event. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton is expected to miss the Bruins' next meet March 2 against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But Andrews danced and flipped and twisted as the crowd stood and rocked along 
with Andrews and her heavy-metal music. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins opened an early lead during the meet's first rotation when Hamilton 
scored a 9.85 on the combined scores of her two vaults.

SOVIETS STEAL THE U.S. SHOW, 3-1; 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER: SUPER SUMMIT BECOMES EXTRAVAGANZA, BUT ESTIMATED CROWD OF 61,000 AT 
STANFORD STADIUM IS LEFT DISAPPOINTED. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans showed the world Saturday the contribution they can make to its 
favorite sport. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated crowd of 61,000, the most ever to see the U.S. national soccer 
team play a game other than at the 1984 Summer Olympics, settled into Stanford 
Stadium. Bands played, parachutists landed on the field, pigeons and balloons 
were released into the hazy blue sky, a space shuttle Discovery astronaut 
presented a ball that he carried into space with him and a wild man nicknamed 
Crazy George did whatever it is that he does. 
</P>
<P>
But then the game started, and the reality soon sunk in that the United States 
was no more ready to send its soccer players onto the field against the Soviet 
Union in the so-called Super Soccer Summit than it is to send its watchmakers 
out against the Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
The final score, 3-1, was misleading only in the sense that the Soviets seemed 
more than two goals better than the United States. "This was the test we 
thought it would be, and I think we learned some lessons," U.S. Coach Bob 
Gansler said. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances seemed right for a U.S. upset. One of the world's best teams 
at full strength, the Soviets are far from it at this point because so many of 
their players are injured or under contract to European professional teams. 
</P>
<P>
The players available to the national team are getting into shape for the 
Soviet first division's regular season, which begins March 5. To speed them 
along and get a look at a few young prospects for this summer's World Cup, 
their federation sent them on a 25-day trip, which began with 10 games in 
Italy, resumed with two games last week in Los Angeles and concluded here. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the U.S. team spent a week in Bermuda, won two games there against 
modest opposition, then trained in Palo Alto for a week. Except for midfielder 
Hugo Perez, who is playing in the French second division, the team that 
probably will play in the World Cup was intact. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the Soviets who put the more cohesive unit onto the field. On their 
first goal, which came at 28:40, veteran defender Oleg Kuznetsov passed in 
front of the penalty area to midfielder Fedor Cherenkov, who found defender 
Vladimir Bessonov open on the right flank. One-on-one against goalkeeper Tony 
Meola, Bessonov won with a right-footed shot into the left corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
On the third, the only goal of the second half, defender Andrei Zigmantovic 
made a run down the center of the field toward the goal, drew four defenders, 
then passed to an open Oleg Protasov, who had to beat only Meola for the score. 
</P>
<P>
John Harkes scored the only U.S. goal, briefly tying the score at 41:56, but 
the offense was accepting no congratulations because it came on a penalty kick 
after a questionable foul call against Oleg Luzny.

A 14-0 REBEL RUN KNOCKS DOWN LOUISVILLE; 
</P>

UNLV: CARDINALS MISS THEIR FIRST SIX SHOTS AS TARKANIAN'S THIN SQUAD WINS ITS 
10TH IN A ROW AND COMPLETES PERFECT HOME SEASON, 91-81.

<TEXT>
<P>
A perfect opening six minutes Saturday against Louisville capped a perfect home 
season for fourth-ranked Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels used a 14-0 spurt to open the game and never trailed en route to a 
91-81 victory over the No. 16 Cardinals that ended UNLV's home season with a 
17-0 record, the team's best. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an easy place to win even playing a bad team, and they're a very 
good team," Louisville Coach Denny Crum said. "They just jumped on us real 
quick and got a big lead on us." 
</P>
<P>
UNLV's stifling defense forced three turnovers and Louisville missed its first 
six shots as the Cardinals dug themselves into a hole from which they couldn't 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure defense early was incredible," UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian said. 
"They never had a chance to get in their offense early." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Johnson had 22 points and 15 rebounds and all five UNLV starters scored 
in double figures as UNLV won its 10th game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel guard Greg Anthony, wearing a mask to protect a jaw he fractured four 
games ago, came back after being knocked to the floor in a jarring collision 
during the opening minute to add 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had to make up my mind to go out there and play physical," Anthony 
said. "I've been knocked down a few times so I don't really worry about it now. 
I expect to be hit." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson scored four of his points during an 8-0 run by UNLV with five minutes 
remaining that broke open a 73-69 game. 
</P>
<P>
Center Felton Spencer scored 24 points before fouling out with 2:43 left to 
lead Louisville, which was playing without its leading scorer, Jerome Harmon, 
suspended for two games because of academic problems. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hadn't got the ball to Spencer, we'd have gotten beat by 30 points," 
Crum said. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV took advantage of foul trouble by Louisville to score 12 of its last 18 
points on free throws and pull away to the victory. UNLV outscored Louisville, 
18-5, at the foul line in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV, beset by injuries and playing its 10th game in 24 days, used only two 
reserves for a total of 22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I found myself praying for the game to end," Anthony said. "I was just 
fatigued." 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian said the grueling schedule caused his team to let down defensively 
after the opening minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible how many games we played without any rest," Tarkanian said. 
"We played with so much courage, so much heart. We have nothing left in us." 
</P>
<P>
UNLV, which ends its regular season with three Big West Conference games on the 
road, improved to 24-4. Louisville, losing two in a row for the first time this 
season, fell to 20-7. 
</P>
<P>
LaBradford Smith added 20 points for the Cardinals. Anderson Hunt had 17 and 
Stacey Augmon scored 16 for UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville trailed by five at halftime and kept within reach of the Runnin' 
Rebels, drawing to within 68-65 on a basket by Cornelius Holden with 8:10 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV answered with five points in a row, however, and the Cardinals were able 
to get no closer. 
</P>
<P>
After UNLV's opening spurt, Tony Kimbro's jumper sparked an 11-2 spurt that 
pulled the Cardinals within 16-11. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV stretched the lead to as many as 13 points midway through the half, but 
Louisville scored 10 of the last 13 points of the half to pull within 42-37 at 
halftime.

Keith Hill scored 22 points and Randy Brown had 21, including eight in a row 
late in the first half, as No. 24 New Mexico State beat San Jose State, 101-70, 
Saturday night and finished the year 16-0 at home. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies (23-3, 14-2 in the Big West) have two road games and the conference 
tournament left. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's eight points sparked a 14-3 run. He scored on a three-point shot, a 
three-point play and then stole the ball and scored on a dunk to give the 
Aggies a 37-27 lead. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose State (7-18, 4-11), which rallied from deficits of 10-0 and 21-13, 
never recovered. New Mexico State led at halftime, 47-35. 
</P>
<P>
Michael New and Reggie Jordan added 18 points apiece for New Mexico State, 
which broke the 100-point mark for the second game in a row and for the fourth 
time this season. Kenne Young led the Spartans with 16.

LIONS USE POWER OF THE PRESS, 117-81;

<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: LOYOLA MARYMOUNT USES FULL-COURT TRAP AND RUNS AWAY FROM 
SANTA CLARA.

Loyola Marymount tuned up for next weekend's West Coast Conference tournament 
Saturday with a 117-81 victory over Santa Clara, the team it has met in the 
past two tournament finals. Before a sellout crowd of 4,156 in Gersten 
Pavilion, the Lions ran their record to 22-5 and finished 13-1 in the WCC. 
Loyola, which will play host to the tournament, opens against last-place 
Gonzaga at 2 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara (9-18, 6-8) finished in fifth place and will face fourth-place 
Portland. Those times will be announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Kimble led the Lions with 35 points and 11 rebounds. Hank Gathers added 29 
points. The two shot a combined 26 of 37 as the Lions shot 60% for the game. 
Jeffty Connelly led Santa Clara with 26 points and center Ron Reis added 20 
points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
For 12 minutes, Santa Clara successfully worked the clock and pushed the ball 
inside, building a lead that reached eight points. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Coach Paul Westhead then altered his press, maintaining a full-court 
trap that helped the Lions take a 50-36 halftime lead. In the second half, the 
Lions outscored the Broncos, 67-45. 
</P>
<P>
The pace changed noticeably when Bronco guard Melvin Chinn was called for an 
intentional foul with 7:35 to play in the half. Kimble hit both free throws to 
pull the Lions to within 24-23, then Kimble hit a jump shot off the inbounds 
pass to give Loyola its first lead. 
</P>
<P>
A Connelly layup momentarily put Santa Clara ahead, but Gathers scored the next 
six points in the midst of a 16-3 run and Loyola built its 14-point halftime 
lead. Gathers scored 18 and Kimble 15 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to a press we've never used," Westhead said. "It's a very chancy 
defense. Usually you tire after three minutes. We used it for 23 minutes. It's 
like a contingency defense, if someone's holding the ball and we don't like the 
pace, we'll use it. I think it turned the game around. To us, pace is 
all-important." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions pushed it into overdrive early in the second half. They had an 8-0 
streak over 22 seconds and outscored the Broncos, 25-6, in a 3:23 span, taking 
an 87-54 lead on Kimble's three-point basket with more than 11 minutes left. 
The Lions forced the Broncos into 17 second-half turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, who made 12 of 16 shots, called Saturday's effort "one of the best 
games we've played in several weeks. We did something a little different and it 
speeded up the game. The team's energy level was real high. I'm not tired -- I 
don't even feel like I played a game." 
</P>
<P>
It took the Lions a little longer than usual to reach 100 points, but they 
managed it with 5:50 left for the 24th time this season, an NCAA record. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead hopes to keep adding to it for a while. "The significance (of the 
record) is when we get into the hundreds, we usually win. Hopefully we've got a 
lot more games to go."

WAVES HAVE A NIGHT TO REMEMBER;

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: SENIORS GO OUT IN STYLE IN LEADING PEPPERDINE TO 102-89 
VICTORY OVER SAN DIEGO.

Pepperdine seniors Dexter Howard, Shann Ferch, Tom Lewis and Craig Davis made 
their last appearance before a home crowd Saturday night a memorable one. 
</P>
<P>
Howard scored a game-high 29 points, Ferch had 20, Davis 17 and Lewis 16 as the 
Waves defeated the University of San Diego, 102-89, before 3,027 at Firestone 
Fieldhouse in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine took sole possession of second place in the West Coast Conference, 
finishing the regular season at 16-11, 10-4 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego, which fell to 14-12 and 9-5, dropped to third place in the WCC. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis scored inside and outside, and Ferch hit consistently from the outside, 
as the Waves made 10 of 13 three-point shots (76.9%) in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis made six of nine field goal attempts in the game and was four of four 
from three-point range. Ferch scored 14 points in the first half, including 
four three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Howard scored 18 points, and Davis made a couple of key baskets in the second 
half, which helped to hold off the charging Toreros. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said that the Waves have to go into next weekend's 
conference tournament at Loyola and "get after them, whoever (we play). I've 
got a feeling it's going to be San Diego" eventually. The Waves face St. Mary's 
in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves took control early, after Lewis made a three-point shot during an 
11-2 run that gave them a 24-16 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Ferch scored 14 points, and Lewis added 13, and Pepperdine held a 57-43 lead at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
With 45 seconds left in the half, San Diego's Anthony Thomas got into a shoving 
match with Geoff Lear. 
</P>
<P>
A foul was called on Thomas, who protested angrily and shouted at a referee. He 
was given a flagrant technical foul and ejected from the game. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego scored the first six points of the second half and kept the pressure 
on the rest of the game, twice closing to within three points. 
</P>
<P>
But Geoff Lear made a layup and two free throws, and Howard dunked after 
picking up a loose ball and then made a three-point play. That 9-0 run seemed 
to take the starch out of the Toreros.

LENDL, BECKER MEET IN FINAL AT STUTTGART

<P>
Ivan Lendl and Boris Becker, the two top-ranked players in the world, advanced 
to the championship match of the $1-million ATP tennis tournament at Stuttgart, 
West Germany, by beating unseeded Swedish opponents in Saturday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, seeded No. 1, struggled to overcome Magnus Gustafsson, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 
6-3, and second-seeded Becker beat Jonas Svensson, 7-5, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl and Becker have not met in tournament play since the final of the U.S. 
Open in New York in September, when Becker won the title for the first time in 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl will go into the meeting with a 21-match winning streak and bidding for 
his fourth consecutive title. In January he won the Australian Open for the 
second time and this month he has ATP tour titles in Milan, Italy and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, in Saturday's match, trailed 0-3 and 3-5 in the first set, but broke 
Svensson's serve to save the set and start a rally. 
</P>
<P>
Andres Gomez needed just 48 minutes to defeat Petr Korda, 6-2, 6-0, to advance 
to the final of the $1-million U.S. Pro Indoor tournament at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez will meet Pete Sampras, a 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 winner over Mark Kratzmann. 
Sampras broke service twice in each of the last two sets to stop Kratzmann's 
winning streak at seven matches. It will be Sampras' first final. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras, 18, is ranked 32nd in the world and is seeded 13th in this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras got past Milan Srejber, third-seeded Andre Agassi and fifth-seeded Tim 
Mayotte to reach the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez is ranked 18th in the world and seeded seventh in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Zina Garrison defeated No. 4 Natalia Zvereva, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, to 
move into the final of the Virginia Slims of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison, ranked fourth in the world, lost her serve three times in the second 
set, giving the last one away with two consecutive double-faults that allowed 
Zvereva to even the match. 
</P>
<P>
But Garrison began charging the net repeatedly and started the third set with 
two consecutive breaks to regain control in her bid for her first title of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison will play top-seeded Martina Navratilova, who won 10 of the final 11 
games to overwhelm third-seeded Monica Seles, 6-3, 6-0. Navratilova has won the 
Washington tournament nine times. 
</P>
<P>
Tied 2-2 in the first set, Navratilova broke Seles' serve six games in a row to 
take over. She went to the net repeatedly and finally forced the 16-year-old 
from Yugoslavia to hit a forehand wide for the break that gave Navratilova the 
first set. 
</P>
<P>
She opened the second set with eight consecutive points, then fought off two 
break points to take a 3-0 lead.

Said Aouita, running indoors for the first time this season, held off Julius 
Kariuki and won the 3,000 meters at the inaugural DN Games track and field meet 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan, holder of five outdoor world records but none indoors, was timed 
in 7 minutes 50.64 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Kariuki, the Olympic 3,000-meter steeplechase champion from Kenya, was timed in 
7:50.68. 
</P>
<P>
Aouita's best 3,000 time outdoors is 7:39.71. The world record is 7:39.2 by 
Emiel Puttemans of Belgium. Aouita, who ran his last outdoor race Sept. 18 in 
India, seldom competes indoors. "I'm going to run one more indoor race in Spain 
on Tuesday and that's all for this season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth champion Peter Elliott of Britain coasted to victory in the 1,500 
meters in 3:44.94 for his third consecutive indoor triumph. Elliott won two 
mile races in the United States recently. 
</P>
<P>
Herve Phelippeau of France, the 1989 European indoor champion, was second in 
3:45.62 and Jens-Peter Herold of East Germany third in 3:46.54. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans dominated the short races, with James Butler winning the 200 
meters in 21.37 and 400-meter hurdles specialist Danny Harris taking the 400 in 
46.39. 
</P>
<P>
Houston McTear, 33, still a fast starter, led the 60 meters most of the way. 
But Chidi Imoh of Nigeria edged him at the finish by four-hundredths of a 
second in 6.68. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my first loss in five meets in Sweden, but the field was a lot tougher 
today," said McTear, a former world record-holder in the 60 who lives in 
Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Pierce was the only other American winner, clocking 7.68 in the 60-meter 
hurdles. Igor Kazanov of the Soviet Union was eight hundredths behind. 
</P>
<P>
World indoor champion Rodion Gataullin, who was ranked No. 1 outdoors last 
year, won the pole vault at 19-1/4. Philippe Collet of France finished second 
at 18-6 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Jose-Luis Barbosa, the 1987 world indoor champion, took the 800 in 
1:48.32. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Gasser of Switzerland, back in competition after serving two years for a 
steroid suspension, won a close women's 1,500 meters in 4:12.41.

BASKETBALL: SUSAN HELM, 36, STICKS WITH THE GAME AT RANCHO SANTIAGO. 
</P>

<P>
Forget the turnaround jump shot and the no-look pass. The toughest move for 
Susan Helm, a member of the Rancho Santiago College women's basketball team, is 
slightly more delicate. 
</P>
<P>
It's known as the tuck-in. 
</P>
<P>
Helm is a 36-year-old sophomore forward. If that's not unusual enough, she has 
several other matters -- five daughters to be exact -- to attend to during the 
average day. In her most important role, Helm is a single mother. 
</P>
<P>
When the classes are over, the homework is finished, the dishes are washed and 
the laundry is clean, her toughest job starts: getting five energetic girls to 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
"Nights are the hardest because I want to make sure they can talk to me," Helm 
said. "We reinforce each other. It does take a long time to get them to bed." 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the other problems Helm has faced, however, she considers tucking 
in her children a joy. 
</P>
<P>
After 15 years of marriage, Helm was divorced in 1988. It was a difficult time, 
but her five children helped pull her through. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah, 13, Karen, 12, Lisa, 10, and twins Katie and Rebecca, 8, helped Helm see 
the brighter side. 
</P>
<P>
Helm, a 1972 graduate of Tustin High, had married one year after high school. 
Her only college experience, she said, was "a few night classes." 
</P>
<P>
She enrolled at Rancho Santiago for the 1988 fall semester. And after returning 
to school, things started looking up for Helm. She ended up on the court, 
however, only because she was looking down. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving a computer class one day in October, 1988, Helm saw a flyer taped 
to the sidewalk announcing tryouts for the basketball team. Although she played 
only one year of organized basketball, as a high school senior, she decided to 
meet with the coach. "I thought to myself, 'Maybe I can keep stats or 
something,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Myrond Brown met with Helm and convinced her to work out with the team 
for a while. At her first practice, Brown saw some shooting ability and 
much-needed height in the 6-foot Helm. He didn't, however, see a basketball 
future for Helm, who struggled to catch passes and simply keep her balance. 
</P>
<P>
"She had a couple of hard falls and she was very discouraged about not being 
able to catch the ball very well," said Brown. "I remember thinking to myself, 
'I will not see her tomorrow.' I've seen people come out after being away from 
the game for a long time. Normally, a person like that will disappear." 
</P>
<P>
But Helm, who had never even learned to dribble, kept coming back until she had 
earned a spot on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Coach if he didn't tell me to stop I wouldn't," Helm said. "I'd keep 
trying. That's what I did with my marriage. You figure if you work hard enough, 
things will work out. At the end of the season, (Brown) asked me to come back. 
I just looked at him and said, 'Really?' It made me feel great." 
</P>
<P>
Her statistics that first year were not overly impressive. She averaged about 
four minutes and three points a game during the 1988-89 season. 
</P>
<P>
This season, she started five games, averaging 3.2 points and 4.6 rebounds a 
game. A measure of how far Helm has progressed came in mid-December when she 
scored 12 points on a six-for-six shooting performance. 
</P>
<P>
"She was shocking," Brown said. "Every time the ball went to her, she scored. 
She used to have to be wide open to score." 
</P>
<P>
But numbers fail to tell Helm's worth to the team, Brown stressed. When she 
first started playing, he praised Helm's work habits so often that he feared 
other team members would begin resenting her. Helm left each practice about 30 
minutes early to pick her children up at school. To make up for the lost time, 
she worked out in the weight room and trained alone before practice. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who has four children of his own, marvels at Helm's ability to manage 
her time. "I like to point her out to the other players, hoping they can get as 
organized as her, not just in basketball, but in life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Helm may not be a star, but she was seldom without a loyal cheering section. 
Her children attended nearly every game and are becoming interested in 
basketball. Sarah is learning how to dribble and can already play "in-your-face 
defense," according to Helm. 
</P>
<P>
"My kids are great," she said. "They're the most important thing to me." 
</P>
<P>
Helm's collegiate basketball career ended last Friday when Rancho Santiago 
played host to Cypress in the team's final game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental planning and ecology major, Helm has two semesters remaining 
at Rancho Santiago. She hopes to transfer to UC Irvine when she leaves Rancho 
Santiago, but laughed at the thought of trying out for the basketball team. 
"They're better than I could ever dream of being," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Helm has more than passing and shooting skills, said Brown. "Last 
year you could see the wear and tear of what she was going through," he said. 
"Now, she's smiling more. I know she's a changed person." 
</P>
<P>
Helm agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt I'd take care of the house, take care of the kids, be the room 
mom and stuff like that," she said. "I never thought of myself as being able to 
do the things I've done now, but I was put in a position where I had to look 
inside myself and see if I had the strength to stand up on my own. And I did."

DISNEY'S TELEVISION QUEST; 
</P>
<P>
NETWORK PRIME-TIME SUCCESS STILL ELUDES THE GIANT THAT'S ENJOYED MOVIE HITS AND 
PROFITS AT ITS THEME PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Across three sound stages at the Culver Studios lies the first lunar colony. 
Emily's, a diner with a crater view, is serving mushroom burgers and onion 
omelets. Across a town plaza graced with potted plants, the medical clinic 
stands ready for any emergency. Nearby sits the general store, a cave-like 
building that also houses the local barber shop and the communications center. 
</P>
<P>
This is Plymouth -- the lunar colony featured in an upcoming TV movie of the 
same name that the Walt Disney Co. is producing for ABC. There is no guarantee 
that the elaborate set will ever be used for anything but this one telefilm. 
Disney executives hope, however, that the moon village and the "jes' folks" 
townspeople who inhabit it will score huge ratings and leave TV viewers crying 
for more. The studio is itching for ABC to pick up "Plymouth" as a weekly 
series for the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
But as the Walt Disney Co. has learned the hard way, landing on the moon is one 
thing. Landing on a network schedule is something else. 
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated efforts, Disney has not been successful at producing 
prime-time network programs. The only show it has been able to sustain is the 
venerable "Magical World of Disney" on Sunday nights, and even that ranks only 
76th among 96 series that have been on the three major networks this season. 
NBC executives are not sure they will renew it for another year. 
</P>
<P>
The company's poor showing is particularly mysterious because it stands in 
dramatic contrast to the gains that Disney has made in every other field since 
it was revitalized by an aggressive new management team in 1984. In the years 
since Chairman Michael Eisner and his lieutenants set up shop at the 
then-moribund company, Disney has become a diverse entertainment powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
In feature films, Disney hit No. 1 at the box office in 1988 before dropping to 
fourth place in 1989. The company vied with Warner Bros. for the top slot in 
the home video market in 1989, with an estimated $480 million in sales, and 
should continue to dominate the industry, says Seth Goldstein, senior editor of 
This Week in Consumer Electronics. Syndicated cartoons, Disney merchandise, the 
Disney Channel on cable -- all are part of the success story. Disneyland and 
Disney World remain national institutions as well as the company's biggest 
income-generators. 
</P>
<P>
The Theme Park and Resorts division brought in $2.6 billion last year while the 
Filmed Entertainment division, which includes theatrical releases, broadcast 
television, cable and home video, grossed $1.6 billion. The Consumer Products 
division brought in $411 million. Total company revenues were up 34% from 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Yet while the rest of the company has taken a rocket to the top, the network TV 
division is still waiting to blast off. 
</P>
<P>
It has produced pilots that didn't become series. It has produced series that 
quickly disappeared -- among them ABC's "Ellen Burstyn Show" in 1986 and 
"Harry" in 1987, CBS' "The Oldest Rookie" in 1987, Fox's "Down and Out in 
Beverly Hills" in 1987 and CBS' "Hard Time on Planet Earth" in 1989. It has 
tried and failed to develop series within the framework of its Sunday-night 
anthology -- in an earlier incarnation on ABC and then, for the past two 
seasons, on NBC. Duds include revivals of "Davy Crockett," "The Absent-Minded 
Professor" and "Parent Trap." 
</P>
<P>
Disney's only new prime-time entry this season was the NBC sitcom "Nutt House." 
It was axed after five episodes. 
</P>
<P>
Now even "The Magical World of Disney" is in trouble. Disney executives, 
anxious to keep the program alive, have sent bushels of new programming ideas 
for it to NBC. "It's a major priority for the television division at Disney," 
reports Warren Littlefield, executive vice president of prime-time programs at 
NBC. Getting the series renewed, he says, has the "time and attention" of 
Disney's top executives, including Eisner and Walt Disney Studios Chairman 
Jeffrey Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
The show, which has survived changes of networks, titles and time periods -- 
even a three-year absence from TV -- since it debuted in 1954, has long been 
used by Disney as a way of promoting various company projects, especially its 
theme parks. "The 'World of Disney" is, in effect, a commercial for the Disney 
company," grumbles another NBC executive. 
</P>
<P>
Determined to boost its lowly ranking, Disney has embarked on a costly mission 
to muscle its way into the network business. The company is spending millions 
buying up talent -- trying to find the people who will produce, write and star 
in shows that can climb to the heights of the Nielsens. Former Fox Broadcasting 
executive Garth Ancier was brought in as president of network production one 
year ago to oversee the process. 
</P>
<P>
Among the people signed to Disney are "Roseanne" creator Matt Williams, who is 
working on a new Carol Burnett series for NBC; the original team of head 
writers from "The Golden Girls," who have a project in development at NBC; and 
"L.A. Law" co-creator Terry Louise Fisher, who is developing a drama for CBS 
about a woman in the legal profession. Also tied to Disney are numerous others 
writers and producers who are not household names but have been associated with 
hit shows. 
</P>
<P>
"That's suddenly going from nobody to a whole lot of people," observes NBC's 
Littlefield. "The last few years they've been crawling. Now they're walking." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Disney executives like to boast about the performance and quality 
of the high-rated NBC shows "Golden Girls" and "Empty Nest," which appear under 
Disney's Touchstone Television banner. But some industry observers believe the 
boasts are misleading because Disney serves only as the financial backer and 
distributor of those shows, taking a share of the profits in return. It's 
Witt-Thomas-Harris Productions that created the shows and that churns them out 
each week. In fact, the modest-sized production company had already sold 
"Golden Girls" to NBC when Disney stepped into the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's low network profile apparently has not escaped the watchful eyes of 
Wall Street. When rumors of a possible Disney-CBS merger resurfaced earlier 
this month, one analyst told the Hollywood Reporter that Disney would be the 
perfect studio to take over a network. The reasoning went that since government 
regulations prohibit networks from syndicating shows they produce, most studios 
would stand to lose huge profits if they coupled with a network. But it would 
not be a problem for Disney, the analyst said, "because they are a non-factor 
in the prime-time series business." 
</P>
<P>
The question is, why? Why would a company have such a dismal record in one 
field when it has found such a winning formula everywhere else? 
</P>
<P>
The answer, some industry analysts and insiders say, may be found within the 
question itself. 
</P>
<P>
Some suggest that Disney may have hobbled itself by using the same techniques 
to produce television shows that it uses to produce feature films. During its 
climb to the upper levels of the film business, Disney became known as a studio 
that liked to keep a tight fist on the budget and a strong hand in the creative 
process. That M.O. appears to have carried over to the TV business as well. 
</P>
<P>
"What works in features might not work in television," says Leslie Moonves, 
executive vice president of creative affairs at Lorimar, the leading supplier 
of network programs for the past three seasons. "Lorimar has proven the point 
in the opposite way," he laughs, noting his company's weak performance in film 
production. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney network division also has sometimes suffered because of conceptual 
problems in developing programs. Such was apparently the case when the studio 
sold a TV version of its hit movie "Down and Out in Beverly Hills" -- about a 
bum who moves in with a rich family -- to the new Fox Broadcasting network. The 
concept not only was sold without a pilot but also without the involvement of 
any creative staff at all. Disney's upper management reportedly sold the 1987 
show directly to Fox Chairman Barry Diller. When work on the series finally 
began, producers found there was nowhere to take the story week after week. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's TV department also has built a reputation for stubbornness and hard 
bargaining. Several NBC staffers say the studio can be difficult to work with. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't say to you that doing business with them is easy," Littlefield says. 
"The studio comes to its projects with a point of view. They come at it with a 
stamp. Sometimes we go to war with them." 
</P>
<P>
Producers and writers have felt the imprint of the Disney stamp. 
</P>
<P>
"Nightmare on Dopey Drive," is the way one producer termed his experience on a 
Disney TV project. Staying true to their cost-conscious reputation, Disney 
officials would not budget money for original music for the show. "They wanted 
us to use music from previous Disney shows," the producer said. "They're 
completely hands-on, starting with the kind of staples you use. There's a 
tremendous amount of interference." 
</P>
<P>
On a 1988 Disney sitcom pilot for CBS called "Tickets, Please," (" 'Cheers' on 
a train" was one description), executive producer Charlie Peters saw studio 
executives edit out a subplot containing roughly a third of his show just 
before it was presented to the network for consideration. Peters, now with two 
feature films in development at Disney, was reluctant to speak of the studio 
overhaul of his work. "I don't think they made or broke the show," he says. 
</P>
<P>
A former "Nutt House" staffer says Disney programming executives tried to 
sugar-coat the series. "While the producers' and writers' desire was to create 
wild and crazy comedy in the tradition of Mel Brooks," the staffer said, 
"Disney executives insisted it be filled with heart and poignancy." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is complaining, though. "Disney's been terrific to us," says Terry 
Grossman, one of the four ex-"Golden Girls" head-writers who formed their own 
production company and signed on with the studio. "We have tremendous freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Another explanation for the tepid performance of Disney's network efforts, some 
TV industry executives believe, is that strengthening Disney's network 
television division was not a top priority when Eisner and crew took over the 
company. Instead, the new managers focused their immediate attention on their 
biggest assets -- the theme parks and the film business. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone can argue with that strategy for success," says NBC's 
Littlefield. 
</P>
<P>
Disney executives won't discuss strategy -- or anything else about their 
network TV operations, for that matter. Studio executives declined to be 
interviewed for this story. A company spokeswoman said that Disney officials 
will be happy to talk "when we have a story to tell." 
</P>
<P>
Disney staffers -- including Randy Reiss, executive vice president of Walt 
Disney Studios and president of its network TV division -- also took the highly 
unusual step of calling people who have worked on Disney television programs to 
ask them not to talk to The Times. Some people also were asked if they knew of 
anybody who had agreed to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
But people throughout the TV industry are talking about Disney and are watching 
closely to see if the company's current drive pays off. With only a limited 
number of time periods available on network schedules, a strong entry by Disney 
into prime time would affect every other company fighting for the same precious 
slots. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Disney in the future will do much better," Lorimar executive Moonves 
predicts. He believes his rival had not been managing its network operations 
effectively before the new talent-buying push. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they have not had the proper show-runners," he says, referring to the 
studio executives and producers who oversee budgets, production schedules and 
story development. Now he thinks Disney's spending spree has brought them "not 
just creators, but people who can run shows." 
</P>
<P>
"From the NBC perspective," says Littlefield, "Disney seems to have come to 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Disney has numerous projects in development at the No. 1 network. 
</P>
<P>
"Carol &amp; Company," the comedy anthology starring Carol Burnett, has been 
slowed by problems of concept and execution -- namely how to put on a different 
show with different characters every week. But it should reach viewers this 
spring, Littlefield says. Michael Jacobs, the "My Two Dads" producer who also 
is tied to Disney, is developing one project for the "Magical World of Disney" 
and another series for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
The former "Golden Girls" team is making a pilot for NBC tentatively titled 
"Fanelli and Sons," about a widow whose four grown sons, aged 19 to 40, move 
back in with her. Disney also is producing a pilot for NBC called "Hell Street 
High," which will be a musical set in a high school. 
</P>
<P>
The studio has strengthened its ties to Witt-Thomas-Harris Productions, 
recently signing the company that produced "Beauty and the Beast," "Benson" and 
"Soap" to an exclusive contract that gives Disney the distribution rights to 
its TV projects for 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Also developing Disney shows for NBC are William Blinn ("Our House") and Ken 
Estin ("Taxi"). "L.A. Law" co-creator Terry Louise Fisher produced a pilot at 
Disney for NBC last season that was not picked up. This year she is producing 
one for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Disney projects in development at ABC is "STAT," a comedy about 
doctors and nurses in an inner-city trauma center. The producer is Danny 
Arnold, co-creator and former executive producer of "Barney Miller." 
</P>
<P>
And there is the ambitious "Plymouth," which is being produced by David Zlotoff 
("MacGyver"). With a budget estimated at $8 million, the lunar project carries 
a price tag that is roughly double the cost of an average TV movie. Disney has 
hedged its bets on the costly project and entered a co-venture arrangement with 
the Italian media company RAI-Uno. The Italians have invested about half the 
budget in exchange for international distribution rights, Disney officials have 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear what financial involvement ABC has in "Plymouth." But if the 
network is paying an average TV movie license fee -- $3.5 million might be 
about right -- then Disney has little to lose in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Whether signing pricey deals will translate into network success for Disney 
remains to be seen. As a Disney spokeswoman put it while explaining why studio 
executives did not want a story about their TV efforts, "Just because you're 
buying up all the talent in town doesn't mean you're going to be the biggest 
success in town."

LOCALLY, THE COMPANY'S KCAL IS ARMED WITH HIGH TECH AND JERRY DUNPHY -- BUT CAN 
IT FIND AN AUDIENCE FOR THREE HOURS OF PRIME-TIME NEWS?

It will have the biggest news staff, the newest cameras, satellite links, 
trucks and editing systems, and the highest-paid anchor of any television 
station in town. And it will be the only commercial TV station ever to program 
all three hours of prime time with news instead of entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
It's either the dumbest thing anyone has ever tried in the history of local 
television or another coup for the entertainment conglomerate founded by Walt 
Disney, which has proven so successful in such diverse endeavors as amusement 
parks, motion pictures, pay television, TV syndication and the merchandising of 
toys. 
</P>
<P>
On March 5, the Walt Disney Co.'s first and only television station, KCAL 
Channel 9, will roll out its once-delayed and much-anticipated three-hour, 8 to 
11 p.m. local newscast. 
</P>
<P>
To get it off the ground, Disney reportedly has poured $30 million into 
upgrading the station's news department. A big chunk -- $5 million -- went to 
Jerry Dunphy, who was lured away from KABC Channel 7 last year with a 
five-year, million-dollar-a-year contract. The rest went to pay the other 149 
news employees -- up from the 38 that the previous owner employed -- and to 
equip the station with an impressive arsenal of electronic news hardware. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 18 camera truck units -- 10 (that can broadcast) live -- plus a 
satellite truck, plus a chopper equipped with a microwave," said Bob Henry, 
KCAL's news director, sounding like an army general bragging about the strength 
of the unit under his command. "We also have 16 edit suites on site, three vans 
equipped with editing, a satellite truck equipped with editing and a travel 
edit package that we can send to remote locations. That's 21 total editing 
units." 
</P>
<P>
They have a new, ultra-modern newsroom and a new set built on a sound stage at 
Paramount Studios in Hollywood. They will eventually position a camera on the 
roof of the sound stage that will be capable of shooting a 360-degree panorama 
of all of Los Angeles. They have sports guys, weathermen, consumer reporters, 
entertainment reporters, health reporters and business reporters. They have 
contracts with CNN, the London-based Worldwide Television News and Conus (a 
conglomerate of about 90 stations equipped with satellite trucks that share 
feeds with each other) to supply video from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
They have just about everything, including the assurance from Michael Eisner, 
chairman of Walt Disney Co., that even if the prime-time newscast struggles for 
years to draw an audience large enough to make this enterprise even a tiny bit 
profitable, Disney will not pull the plug. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not kidding ourselves. We are not going to be competitive or 
financially profitable in the first week or the first month or probably the 
first year," Eisner told The Times. "It's not like putting on 'The Cosby Show' 
or 'E.T.' or 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and having it be No. 1 in town in the 
first or second week. L.A. residents are going to have to learn that KCAL is 
the place to turn to when events are happenning, to find out what's going on in 
sports or the stock market or out there in the streets. It takes years to earn 
the kind of credibility that we want to get." 
</P>
<P>
Given the imposing obstacles facing KCAL, competitors contend that it will 
probably take longer than that. The station has minimal news credibility, is 
challenging six other strong UHF-TV stations and is trying to lure viewers away 
from "The Cosby Show," "Roseanne" and a myriad other entertainment programs. 
</P>
<P>
"They are competing in a time period that doesn't want news," said Robert 
Hyland, general manager of KCBS Channel 2. "Unless there is a major story, 
viewers in prime time want to be entertained. People can get news from radio or 
CNN any time they want or they can wait for local news at 10 or 11. Viewers 
want to escape, they want relief for a couple of hours. To shear off enough 
viewers in prime time to watch news seems like an impossible assignment." 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if Southern California is wanting for local TV news. Viewers can 
watch some sort of local news at 6-7 a.m., noon-12:30 p.m., 4-7 p.m., 8-8:30 
p.m., 9-9:30 p.m., 10-11 p.m. and 11-11:30 p.m. KNBC Channel 4 repeats its 11 
p.m. newscast at 2 a.m. and again at 4:30 a.m. And that doesn't include any of 
the network news programs or the 24-hours a day of CNN or Headline News on 
cable. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many places already to get news," said Rick Feldman, station 
manager at KCOP Channel 13. "If CNN didn't exist, I'd say this was a good idea. 
But if you are a news junkie, you are probably already watching CNN. To me, 
this newscast seems like it's for junkies. And they already have a home." 
</P>
<P>
For Disney, however, news is an identity. When the company purchased the 
station for $320 million in December, 1988, it acquired Los Angeles' last-place 
station, KHJ-TV, which for two decades had been plagued by licensing problems 
with the Federal Communications Commission and had been underfinanced by its 
owner, RKO. Disney's top priority was getting the local audience to take notice 
of Channel 9. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like being the third and youngest son," said Randy Reiss, Disney Studios 
executive vice president. "Unless you did something different, nobody paid 
attention to you. It's the same in this market." 
</P>
<P>
Reiss said that Disney's research showed that viewers had neither a positive 
nor a negative perception of Channel 9. "We had no image, we were just there," 
he said. "Which is a better place to start from, actually, because you don't 
have to overcome any negatives. So you become something. You change the call 
letters and you become something new." 
</P>
<P>
Deciding what to become was pretty straightforward for most hours of the day. 
Disney produces animated kids programming, so KCAL will carry those programs in 
the mornings and the afternoons. In between, the station is committed to a 
heavy dose of women-oriented talk shows featuring the likes of Regis Philbin, 
Sally Jesse Raphael and Joan Lunden. In the early evening, Disney has chosen to 
spend heavily on syndicated reruns of network sitcoms such as "Who's the 
Boss?," which is on the air, and, for the future, "ALF," "The Hogan Family," 
"Perfect Strangers," "The Golden Girls" and "227." 
</P>
<P>
Prime time wasn't so easy. Independent stations traditionally have relied on 
theatrical movies during those hours. Since Disney makes movies, it would seem 
logical for the company to program those movies on its own television station. 
But Disney executives balked at the idea. "They looked at the market and 
decided that there was too much competition in movies, not only from the other 
three indies (KTLA Channel 5, Fox-owned KTTV Channel 11 and KCOP Channel 13) 
but also from HBO and Showtime and all the rest," said Bruce Cheen, senior 
analyst for Paul Kagen Associates, a media and financial research firm in 
Carmel. "They said, 'Why should I join the pack? I'll carve out a niche in 
news.' " 
</P>
<P>
Explained Richard Frank, president of Walt Disney Studios: "You would have to 
commit over $100 million before you are even in the movie business, and you 
don't start getting those movies for a couple of years. The other way to go was 
to take similar expenditures and try to carve out our own niche in this market. 
We think people are looking for a lot more information in their lives, whether 
it's CNN or ESPN or Financial News Network. People want to know about things. 
They want to be kept on top of everything immediately." 
</P>
<P>
It's a tenant in broadcasting that creating a credible news operation adds 
prestige to a station, and even KCAL's local competitors believe that its 
three-hour newscast will help polish the station's image. "It could be a smart 
thing," said Channel 13's Feldman. "It gets them an image, it gets them talked 
about. If Disney couldn't compete with something else, news could be the 
cheapest thing to program." 
</P>
<P>
"I applaud them for it," said Jeff Wald, news director at KTLA, the longtime 
independent leader in news. "Any time any station makes a commitment to news, 
it puts all of us on our toes to work harder. And I think the viewer wins." 
</P>
<P>
But skepticism abounds about KCAL's ability to attract enough of an audience to 
make this expensive venture profitable. Media analysts say that viewers will 
watch a station's newscast only if the station has earned credibility in news. 
Channel 5 and Hal Fishman dominate the independent news scene because L.A. 
residents have come to trust him over nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Both Channel 11 and Channel 13, for example, have made concerted efforts the 
last few years, although not on this same scale, to upgrade their news 
presence. After anchor changes, format changes and investments in equipment, 
neither has been able to significantly improve the rating of its 10 p.m. 
newscast or make a dent in KTLA's. 
</P>
<P>
Nabbing Dunphy, perhaps the most recognizable newscaster "from the desert to 
the sea (in) all of Southern California," is the one "bright and shining" move 
Disney has made so far, several competitors agree. But Michael Singer, KCBS 
Channel 2 news director, predicted it will take a minimum of five years to 
build a credible news team. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like a 3-year-old fighting an adult," Singer said. "Who are these 
people? They have no track record. They haven't built up a substantial number 
of ground-breaking, award-winning, aggressive reporters. They haven't done 
anything interesting or innovative that I can see. That's probably why they are 
bragging so much about all their trucks. But I have to say that having the most 
satellite uplinks doesn't make a better news." 
</P>
<P>
Producing a better news is what Disney and KCAL executives insist will set 
their news operation apart and, in time, grab enough viewers to contribute 
heavily to Disney's huge coffers. They promise to blanket the city with their 
trucks and crews, providing live coverage from all over Southern California. 
They also promise to offer more depth, more explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have to deliver it," Reiss said. "I've heard these buzzwords -- doing 
the hard news harder, staying with it longer, following it up the next day -- 
I've heard it all before. We will just have to deliver." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Dunphy, 67, the local news icon who will lead the charge for 
Disney, said that he has never seen such a concerted effort "to produce the 
best possible news" in his 30 years in broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best topper for my career that I could imagine," he said. "It's 
kind of nice to be back for real like I was back at Channel 2 when 'The Big 
News' made national history. For the first 10 or 12 years, everyone was 
dedicated to producing a serious news product, and we made everyone take 
notice. Then, it evaporated or was emasculated. 
</P>
<P>
"Disney has shown that it is committed to provide all the support and the 
dollars it's going to take to put together the best-quality news operation 
possible without all the frivolous froth that we've been so accustomed to 
watching on local news. So this is certainly refreshing to me." 
</P>
<P>
More than one competitor insists, however, that Disney is trying to buy 
credibility, believing shiny new equipment will produce quality and ratings. 
The more cynical charge that the money may be a way to seduce advertisers into 
saying, " 'Look what Disney is doing. This is not a stupid company. They must 
be on to something here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Channel 2's Hyland points out that in recent years the network-owned stations 
have been cutting back the number of hours they broadcast news. Not so long 
ago, his station produced news at 4 p.m. and 7 p.m., but it dumped those 
newscasts because it couldn't get an audience. KABC-TV Channel 7, the only 
station airing three full hours of local news in the afternoon, is planning to 
cut back half an hour this fall. Reruns of sitcoms and "Hunter" have been 
slicing into the news ratings on the strong and well-equipped network stations, 
even in these traditional news broadcast periods. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids control the sets in the afternoon and they watch sitcoms on the 
independents," Hyland said. "But kids also control the sets at 8 p.m. And 
during sweeps (the critical ratings periods of February, May and November), 
when Channels 5, 11 and 13 are all airing their best movies and the networks 
air their big miniseries, who is going to give that up to watch the news?" 
</P>
<P>
Eisner acknowledged that "it is a lot of gut instinct" that leads his company 
to believe there is an appetite for news in prime time. The reason news ratings 
are down in the afternoon, Disney contends, is that many would-be news viewers 
aren't home yet. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a great deal of news available in this market, but it's not available 
to a lot of people," said Jim Saunders, KCAL's station manager. "The freeways 
are jammed at 6 p.m. with people who can't get home in time to see one of those 
early newscasts. And if you get home at 7 or 7:30, you sometimes don't want to 
wait until 10 to get the news. We are offering an alternative and providing 
news when the highest concentration of people are available. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we are doing this to provide a service, to break new ground, to create 
something different, but if we knew it was going to lose money, we would not do 
it. This is not a philanthropy." 
</P>
<P>
Dunphy believes CNN has already done much to break traditional news viewing 
habits simply by being available all the time. "And when you translate this to 
local markets, I think you'll find that the same kind of news appetite was 
there all the time, but the product was never there." 
</P>
<P>
KCAL currently airs a half-hour newscast at 8 p.m. and another half-hour at 9 
p.m. Recent ratings for these two programs are slightly lower than they were a 
year ago, before Dunphy and Pat Harvey took over the anchor chores. KCAL 
executives caution, however, that neither the news content nor the ratings 
should be judged yet because their new facility and staff have not been in 
place long enough. The newscast has not even moved onto the new set, which has 
just been completed. (The three-hour newscast was originally scheduled to 
premiere Jan. 15, but KCAL could not get everything ready in time. At press 
time last Wednesday, KCAL still had not secured some of the trucks and the 
helicopter that Henry plans to deploy. The station had also yet to sign the 
anchorwoman it planned to use on the 10 p.m. broadcast.) 
</P>
<P>
Another problem KCAL faces is that news viewership for hourlong newscasts drops 
off significantly over the course of the program. Even Channel 5's 
well-regarded newscast receives higher ratings for the first 15 or 30 minutes 
of the show than for the second half, as viewers turn away after seeing the top 
stories of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Disney officials will not say what sort of rating it will need in order to 
break even. They simply say that "we are not there yet," and that they will 
have to average somewhere between its current rating of about a 3 and KTLA's 
usual 5 or 6 mark (each point represents 49,315 households). "We won't have to 
redefine new ratings levels to live comfortably," Reiss said. 
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, KCAL will benefit from the fact that the people who watch 
TV news are increasingly prized by advertisers, many of whom are willing to pay 
a premium to reach them, said media analyst Cheen. 
</P>
<P>
But others familiar with the local market predict that KCAL will be 
hard-pressed to maintain even its current news ratings, let alone rise to a 4. 
One former Channel 9 news employee said that what will be needed to push the 
venture into the black is nothing less than "a disaster a day." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect to see any kind of ratings jump for the first year, and even if 
it didn't happen then, I wouldn't be discouraged," Frank said. "A lot will 
depend on whether there is a disaster that happens after 6:30 p.m., and then 
people will tune in and find us sooner. We want to ultimately become the 
station that people trust and tune to when something is happening. Right now 
they go to KTLA and that comes from 40 years of covering little girls falling 
in wells and the old 'Jetcopter 5.' If we do a good job, if we show viewers 
that if something breaks we will always be there, we can make people 
comfortable coming to us." 
</P>
<P>
It's a lofty and, even Disney's doubters concede, "noble" goal. And most of 
KCAL's competitors want to withhold judgement until they see the product the 
station puts on the air March 5. 
</P>
<P>
News director Henry remains secretive about the precise content of his 
newscasts, claiming that many of KCAL's plans have some competitive value. He 
said only that the 8 p.m. hour will focus primarily on local news, that the 9 
p.m. broadcast will provide a California perspective on national and 
international news and that the 10 p.m. show, which will face direct 
competition from news on Channels 5, 11 and 13, will be the station's newscast 
of record, covering all the day's events. The anchors will change for each 
hour. Dunphy will be handle the 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. broadcasts. Each newscast 
will feature sports and weather, while money, entertainment and consumer 
segments will be sprinkled throughout. 
</P>
<P>
Henry said that KCAL will also debut a 5:30 a.m. newscast next Monday, will 
continue airing a half-hour newscast at noon and will premiere a 10 p.m. 
weekend newscast on March 10. In all, the station will air 22 hours of local 
news each week. 
</P>
<P>
While Dunphy and weekend anchor Larry Carroll, also formerly of KABC, are 
familiar faces, Disney has staffed the station with a whole new cast, most of 
them from out of town. Henry's last job was news director at a Grand Rapids, 
Mich., station. The weathercasters are from Oklahoma City and Seattle. The 
sports reporters come from Philadelphia, Dallas and Denver. The consumer 
reporter worked in Indianapolis. New reporters and anchors have migrated from 
Cincinnati, Miami, New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Just about everyone who used to produce the station's news -- including former 
news director Stephanie Rank Brady and executive producer Bill Northup -- is 
gone. A joke circulating around town is that Disney hired Dunphy not only to 
read the news on the air but also to read the Thomas Guide street map of Los 
Angeles to all the out-of-town employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Channel 9 was a fairly lackluster, under-performing kind of news operation," 
Henry said when questioned about the housecleaning. "We want people who know 
how to use six live trucks on a given night. The station only had two before. 
We want people who can create graphics using the latest technology. We want 
people who know how to use and dispatch all of our trucks and crews. We want 
people who know how to take in six feeds at once from all over the country. So 
we made changes." 
</P>
<P>
"Live" is the word that Henry uses most to describe why he believes KCAL's news 
will eventually surpass all others in the market and to explain why the station 
needs the helicopter, satellite truck and news vans. Local news in the last 
decade has turned more and more to putting reporters on the air live from 
remote locations -- at the beach describing an oil slick or down at the Forum 
just before the start of a Lakers game. 
</P>
<P>
"Television news is best when reporting on a process in real time," explained 
Channel 2's Singer. "No one else can do that and the impact can be 
extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
But Singer and Channel 5's Wald caution that when a station puts so much 
emphasis on news hardware, even bragging about it in radio ads, it can be 
driven more by the technology than news judgment. 
</P>
<P>
They contend that except for a major earthquake, a station would never need 10 
live shots in one three-hour period. Most news days, one, two, maybe three live 
shots is all that's appropriate and the rest of the stories can be written, 
thought through and researched better on tape, Wald said. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason news ratings are down in general is because executives have let the 
tail wag the dog and the hardware has come to outweigh the significance of the 
story," Wald theorized. "Many stations end up doing something live just for the 
sake of live, and it becomes silly." 
</P>
<P>
Even before it has been able to deploy its new arsenal, KCAL already has been 
guilty of some questionable news judgment. One night this month, the station 
spent several minutes at the top of the newscast at 8 showing a live picture of 
an overturned truck on a freeway in the northern reaches of Los Angeles County. 
The reporter discussed the rather routine accident and interviewed a Highway 
Patrol officer on the scene. The story, Disney executives admitted, was 
inconsequential. 
</P>
<P>
"If all we're doing is having all these trucks out there covering traffic, then 
we will fail," Frank said. "But we will do some good things too. We had the 
first pictures of that recent plane crash in New York because we happened to be 
on the air and the cable station in Long Island is part of our Conus network. 
And our ratings shot up that night." 
</P>
<P>
"We will make some mistakes," said Blake Byrne, KCAL's general manager. "We 
will experiment and make mistakes and learn from them. I just hope the newscast 
on March 5 isn't treated like a Disney movie premiere by those people that have 
the power to comment on what we are doing. We are not in this for a movie 
premiere. We're in this for years."

CHANNEL 9: SEED FOR A NETWORK?; 
</P>
<P>
DISNEY HINTS IT WILL BUY A NUMBER OF STATIONS -- IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT 
</P>

While acknowledging that obtaining a TV station in the home market of their 
Burbank-based corporation was an important incentive for shelling out $320 
million for KCAL Channel 9, top Disney executives also hint that the company is 
not about to stop there. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not looking to develop another network, but television stations 
purchased at the right price are good investments," said Richard Frank, 
president of the Walt Disney Studios and former general manager of KCOP Channel 
13 in Los Angeles. "The price of stations has stabilized. Now we need them to 
do a click or two down. We look at every (station) group that comes up for 
sale, and I believe that the time will come when we will buy a group." 
</P>
<P>
Frank said that Disney is interested primarily in station groups that include 
outlets in the top 20 or 30 markets in the country, preferably independents 
rather than network affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from simply being big money makers, television stations, especially those 
in heavily populated areas, would give a multi-tentacled company like Disney 
what studio executives like to call "synergistic" benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Disney has already cross-promoted Disneyland on KCAL by hosting the station's 
afternoon children's block of programming from the amusement park. Programs 
that the studio syndicates, such as "Siskel &amp; Ebert" and reruns of "The 
Golden Girls," could be distributed to stations it owns. And a station group 
can also be used to develop programs that can then be syndicated across the 
country. Fox, for example, first tested "A Current Affair" and "America's Most 
Wanted" on its own stations before distributing them nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Disney Chairman Michael Eisner calls KCAL a "slight insurance policy" for the 
distribution of Disney programming. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe in buying motion picture theaters because anyone can build a 
movie theater on any corner in the country, so there is no prohibition in 
getting your product played," he said. "That's not quite true in 
government-regulated broadcasting. We felt that it was a good idea to at least 
have a presence to help us understand what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
Eisner would not comment on ongoing rumors that Disney is about to get its own 
network in one fell swoop by buying CBS. But Randy Reiss, executive vice 
president of Walt Disney Studios, said, "Since that's our business, I'm sure 
there's interest." Disney would have to sell KCAL if it bought CBS, because CBS 
owns KCBS Channel 2, and federal regulations prohibit the ownership of more 
than one television station in the same city. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how many stations it eventually buys, Disney is unlikely to put the 
company name on any of them. When Disney was renaming KHJ, Reiss said that 
station executives wanted to call it KDIS or K-WALT because they thought the 
Disney name and reputation would attract viewers. But just as Disney calls its 
adult-oriented movie unit Touchstone, it chose to call its TV station KCAL. 
</P>
<P>
"We would've loved to call it Disney, but there are too many restrictions," 
Reiss said. "Many people look at Disney as a baby sitter. There's a certain 
comfort level and you can't abuse that. Could your news be as appropriate as it 
should? Could you run 'A-Team'? Who knows the programs that we couldn't do. It 
was too much of a burden. Our feeling was we'd like it now, but we'd regret it 
later." STEVE WEINSTEIN

A WINDOW ON A WORLD LESS ORDINARY THAN OUR OWN IS IN DANGER OF CLOSING; IT'S UP 
TO FILMGOERS TO KEEP IT OPEN

Where did you learn about life? When did you first have a glimpse that politics 
could be a literal life-and-death matter, and that sex could have a sheen of 
sophistication? For many of us, the answers to those questions are "Z," "Jules 
and Jim" and a dozen other titles of provocative movies that came to us from 
over there. 
</P>
<P>
For a lucky or daring few young Americans in the Eisenhower and Kennedy and 
Johnson years, the world was discovered first-hand. With knapsacks on their 
backs and their thumbs outstretched, and with eyes and minds open, they invaded 
Paris and Venice and Athens and Stockholm and allowed those cultures to soak 
in. For the rest of us, the window on a world less ordinary -- or certainly 
less predictable -- than our own has always been foreign films. 
</P>
<P>
Intimate details of life in other countries were the riches in the background, 
in case your attention ever wandered from Jean Moreau or Anna Magnani or 
Jean-Paul Belmondo. Sexuality wasn't the only plus to come from "The Lovers," 
in spite of those edifying goings-on in the moonlight. One could also get a 
glimpse of the houses and the philosophy of France's very rich and if, by 
American standards, those blank-faced stone country houses seemed so plain, so 
un-ostentatious, perhaps that was just the point. 
</P>
<P>
Architecture or attitudes could be absorbed almost subliminally. The French 
upper-middle class was on lavish display in "Murmur of the Heart." For 
Americans, it was a cinch to identify with "Murmur's" Italian emigre mother 
with her sprinkle of freckles and her free-spirited behavior when the 
opposition was that entrenched French right wing in those days of Dien Bien 
Phu. 
</P>
<P>
We've gotten information from every frame of even the most unpretentious 
import. "The Grand Highway" provided the color of geraniums that a French 
petit-bourgeois would put on her kitchen table. "Adalen '31" gave a feeling for 
the spare, scrubbed beauty of a modest Swedish villager's house, not all that 
removed from the Russian summer country places in "Oblomov." We could learn 
niceties of behavior that might save face: after countless public bath scenes 
in Japanese movies, it's handy to have learned that one soaps first, then soaks 
in the tub. 
</P>
<P>
There's a gray cloud over all this free experience today. If you've wondered 
what Philippe Noiret has been up to -- all these months before "Cinema 
Paradiso" -- or hungered for the modest French policier or the satisfying small 
Italian comedy, you'll realize that slowly, these pictures have been squeezed 
out of our movie-going menu. 
</P>
<P>
We can still find the heavily promoted major interest foreign films: "Jean de 
Florette," "Hotel Terminus," "Au Revoir Les Enfants." But the solid 
second-level staples, memorable but not stellar, are another matter. Moreover, 
there are great films from the world cinema that have either never made it 
here, or played so briefly that they might not have been here at all. Their 
disappearance feels like an affront. Haven't these films always been part of 
our lives? Won't they continue to be? 
</P>
<P>
Well, that's not the certainty it once was. Realize it or not, we've been 
sliding into the lean years of the foreign language film. At the year-end 
meeting of the National Society of Film Critics, the most heated discussion 
centered around the continuing decline of foreign-language film distribution in 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Laemmle, whose family-owned theaters were the nurturing place of foreign 
cinema in Los Angeles even before the days of "Open City," calls 1989 "the 
worst year ever for specialized film exhibition." This, despite the performance 
of the major successes: all the Pedro Almodovar films; "Little Vera"; "The 
Story of Women"; and the strong showing of "Camille Claudel," which will 
undoubtedly get a further boost from its pair of Academy Award nominations. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for this slump are complex and interlocking. Ever since the 1950s, 
foreign films were a way for Americans to measure the almost touching depths of 
our own innocence. Foreign films, we knew, had "adult themes," from which one 
could learn an inordinate amount about life -- in private and without the need 
of a passport. 
</P>
<P>
We could find in them information that our own screens, reserved for films with 
behavioral seals of approval from the Production Code, couldn't give -- a view 
of politics and sex, poetry and philosophy older and deeper than our own. And 
so we flocked to "The Seventh Seal," and "The Conformist," to "Bitter Rice" and 
"The 400 Blows," to "The Battle of Algiers" and "Mr. Hulot's Holiday," to 
"Knife in the Water" and "Hiroshima, Mon Amour." 
</P>
<P>
Also, in those halcyon times, foreign film-going was simply part of the life of 
a college campus. Friday or Saturday nights meant a foreign movie and hours of 
debate in a coffee house afterwards. More than one sophomore affected a 
world-weariness that was more Antonioni's than his own. And on virtually every 
campus you could find a film society, whose hard seats and 16mm prints 
nevertheless created passionately opinionated young moviegoers. 
</P>
<P>
This was a smart hard core. They knew the works of Godard and Truffaut and 
Rossellini and De Sica as well as they knew the movies of Howard Hawks and John 
Ford, and they could, and frequently would, debate the merits or the 
deficiencies of their idols until the sun came up. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the world has turned. In the mid-'60s, the Production Code buckled and 
with an explosion from within, nudity and language and controversial content 
were no longer cinematic taboos in Hollywood. Suddenly we had films like 
"Bonnie and Clyde," "Midnight Cowboy," "Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice," 
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller," "The Graduate" and "Easy Rider" throwing a new light 
on our past and our present. Such film makers as Arthur Penn and Hal Ashby, 
Mike Nichols and Robert Altman appeared, to distract Americans from their 
fixation on European cinema. 
</P>
<P>
At first, in spite of their gritty subjects, these films had a sleek, 
American-movie look, those smooth surfaces that our film makers had, after all, 
worked for decades to perfect. Only John Cassavetes swam against that expected 
perfection and you can read the outrage with which his films were greeted in 
the mainstream reviews of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the energy and the direction of the American Independent movement, 
our screen has stretched again. Browse from among "My Dinner With Andre," "Blue 
Velvet," "Matewan," "Dim Sum," "River's Edge," "sex, lies and videotape," 
"Stranger Than Paradise," "Drugstore Cowboy," and "Do the Right Thing" and 
you'll see the themes or the visual styles that were once considered "foreign." 
</P>
<P>
Yet even at their most arresting, these films could only stand in the shadow of 
"Fanny and Alexander," "Ran," "The Makioka Sisters," "Night of the Shooting 
Stars" or "Wings of Desire." 
</P>
<P>
To darken the picture, there are now far fewer companies left in the 
specialized film field. Many of the pioneering plungers and risk-takers, 
distributors and exhibitors whose fervor to bring the world's films to American 
audiences was almost messianic, are dying out; among some of the few that are 
left there's an alarming tendency to apply marketing surveys and bottom-line 
conservatism to a field where those statistics least apply. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the matter of broad-based audiences. Schools and colleges haven't 
demanded intellectual curiosity from their students for decades and so 
generations of kids have gotten through high school and into college quite 
without that spark. Among today's television-fed, ultra-conservative college 
students, the ideas that created film societies are as dead as disco, and you 
couldn't get them to a subtitled film. Gary Meyer, whose Landmark Theaters are 
in the heart of college towns nationwide, reports that it's hard enough to lure 
the baby boomers, who grumble but at least still go; college and high school 
students absolutely balk at subtitled films. 
</P>
<P>
So we have a vital age group with virtually no general knowledge about the 
non-mainstream movie past, with television as their only common cultural 
reference point, and the richness of foreign films completely lost to them. And 
we have just tottered out of the Reagan years, a high-water mark in the 
celebration of insularity and smugness. It's not surprising to hear from a 
lecturer at a UCLA graduate-level film class that not one of his 28 students 
had ever heard of "Children of Paradise," much less seen it. 
</P>
<P>
What's left is a broad older audience, baby boomers and their elders, 
apparently growing every year if one believes statistics, who are unafraid of 
subtitles and who think of foreign movies as old, welcome friends. However, the 
marketplace harbors one last sticking point before this audience gets what it 
has grown accustomed to. 
</P>
<P>
Video companies, commercial television and pay-TV -- those lucrative and 
sometimes lifesaving ancillary markets -- are markedly disinterested in 
subtitled foreign films. It makes their distribution even more of a roll of the 
dice than in the past. According to Julian Schlossberg, president of the New 
York-based Castle Hill Productions which distributes both domestic and 
foreign-made films, "An American movie can have a limited or even a tepid 
release in theaters and still do well from sales to video, to cable, or to TV. 
But if a foreign film doesn't do extremely well theatrically, it has virtually 
no life afterwards." 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, these are a few of the reasons why, within the past two years, 
we've seen less of those fine "small" films that dot film festival catalogues 
and provide modest runs at the box office. To have fewer films like "Angi 
Vera," "Hanussen" or "Sundays in the Country" seems an unconscionable loss. 
Additionally, there is a backlog of world-class films, most of them festival 
winners abroad, that have never had theatrical release, among them: Theo 
Angelopoulos' "Landscape in the Mist," Hou Hsiao-Hsien's "A City of Sadness" or 
Krzysztof Kieslowski's towering "Decalogue," his ten separate films on the Ten 
Commandments. The irony is that this is the most dynamic cultural climate we 
have ever lived through. What a sorry time to lose the most revealing way we 
have to understand the politics and the culture of the world beyond our own. 
</P>
<P>
This has been our uncheerful and immediate past. The slightly brighter side is 
that we may, at last, have a blooming foreign film spring. From what it has 
been possible to see at the Toronto Film Festival and at Park City, the major 
imports scheduled are stronger than any time in the last 18 months. Most of 
them are by recognized directors: Denys Arcand's "Jesus of Montreal," (just 
chosen as an Academy Award nominee); Bertrand Blier's, "Too Beautiful for You"; 
Coline Serreau's "Mama, There's a Man in My Bed"; Almodovar's latest, "Tie Me 
Up, Tie Me Down"; Bertrand Tavernier's "Life and Nothing But." Jane Campion's 
groundbreaking "Sweetie" has just opened, and before long we'll have the pure 
delight of veteran actor/director Maurizio Nichetti's "The Icicle Thief." 
</P>
<P>
This slate looks hopeful. AFI/Fest also arrives in mid-April, and from director 
Ken Wlaschin's advance word, it appears to be one of the strongest programs set 
for this city in many seasons. (The festival will include the Kieslowski 
"Decalogue.") 
</P>
<P>
But the straitened period we've just been through leaves one to make some 
cautionary observations. Most importantly, just because they've become integral 
to our lives in the past, it isn't possible to take foreign films for granted. 
Those of us in Los Angeles hardly need to be reminded of that, after the 
disappearance of KFAC and the Z Channel. 
</P>
<P>
We've just seen ordinary people work miracles abroad; this may be the era when 
the supportive foreign film audience has to turn activist, on a slightly less 
life-and-death scale. In the hair-trigger economics of exhibition and 
distribution, audiences may have to work faster too. 
</P>
<P>
It may not be possible to wait for the third or fourth week before moseying out 
to a foreign film that sounds intriguing. And to wait for it to come to video 
is to risk seeing a dubbed version -- or nothing. The leisurely pursuit of 
foreign films may have become a meaner, tougher game; more than ever, it's 
going to be up to the fans to turn out or see the franchise disappear.

FIRST PERSON: A JAPANESE-AMERICAN JOURNEYS TO HIS ANCESTRAL LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD IWATA, Iwata is a free-lance journalist based in San Francisco. This 
article is adapted from a book of autobiographical essays he is writing. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HONSHU, Japan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a brilliant spring day. While trade wars dominated the news in Tokyo, my 
parents and I journeyed into the rural heart of our ancestral homeland to find 
a past we had lost so long ago. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, we were meeting relatives who live on the rice farms our 
ancestors have owned since the feudal 18th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, they've preserved the tradition of handing down the family 
homestead, the honke, from generation to generation, from parent to eldest son. 
In modern Japan, this custom is vanishing like snow after a long rain. 
</P>
<P>
My interest in our heritage comes as Japanese-Americans enter a new era. The 
passage last year of the redress bill ended the saga of my parents' generation, 
which was imprisoned in internment camps during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Redress led to a searching of the soul, a bid for something more, something 
deeper. Now that our loyalty to this nation is no longer questioned, where are 
we headed as Americans of Japanese ancestry? And how can we strengthen our 
cultural legacy? 
</P>
<P>
A sense of urgency prevails for my young generation. Our grandparents, the 
pioneering immigrants, have passed away. And many of our retired parents are 
dying now. 
</P>
<P>
My father, Phillip, my mother, Midori, and 16 relatives spent the war years 
behind barbed wire at Manzanar and other camps. The internment is a horror I 
had never fully grasped. 
</P>
<P>
Despite my parents' wish to keep their ugly memories buried, I explored our 
family history. My quest led us on a spring pilgrimage to the desolate Manzanar 
site in the Mojave Desert. As we walked amid the camp ruins, the ghosts were 
powerful. But I found no neat, easy answers. 
</P>
<P>
I realized I must delve deeper into my family's history to gain a sense of what 
awaits me in the future. In my embrace of the past, I began a search for new 
meaning. 
</P>
<P>
On the crowded train ride to Wakayama, a mountainous region south of Kyoto, my 
mother gossiped in Japanese with an elderly in-law, Takako, who was escorting 
us to the distant village where the Iwata family began five generations ago -- 
our origins. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone, everywhere, looks like my parents, or my late grandparents. Except 
for differences in fashion and body language, the Japanese are reflections of 
our reflections in the mirror. As the train clattered along, I noticed I'd 
dropped my guard, the psychological armor that racial minorities wear to ward 
off the unwelcome scrutiny of their skin color. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling confident, I practiced chatting in Japanese with Akiro Ueno, a friend 
and language teacher who insisted on working for free as my translator. 
Frustrated by my poor Japanese, I started jabbering in English. Every head in 
the train turned like a chorus line to stare at me. 
</P>
<P>
"You look like us," said Ueno, laughing, "but you speak with this funny 
accent." 
</P>
<P>
As our train rumbled out of the city, the crowd of businessmen thinned. We 
entered the countryside, and laborers and noisy schoolchildren climbed aboard. 
Grimy houses and factories vanished, replaced by rice fields and eel ponds that 
glistened in the morning sun. 
</P>
<P>
We passed a train station at Koyaguchi ("Entrance of Koya Mountain"). A sweet, 
tropical fragrance filled the air. Pine, cedar and bamboo trees draped the 
green hills. Tiny figures stooped in the rice fields, planting the new season's 
crop. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours later, our near-empty train slowed at an old station -- WAKAYAMA, a 
wooden sign announced. 
</P>
<P>
A small knot of people waved at us across the railroad tracks. They smiled and 
stood close together, as if posing for a first-ever snapshot for their American 
relatives. We walked shyly toward them. 
</P>
<P>
A short, handsome, gray-haired man grinned broadly and extended his calloused 
hand to me. He is Masao Iwata, the head of toshu ("who represents the house") 
of the Iwata family, my grandfather's nephew. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello, Masao," he said, calling me by my Japanese name, which means "righteous 
boy." We laughed at the coincidence of our names. 
</P>
<P>
After a round of bows and introductions, we drove through town. Hills flanked 
the village. A calm river ran parallel to the road. Soon we arrived at the 
small home of the Noguchis, the family of my grandmother, Tatsue Iwata, who 
died four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Our relatives seated us at a low table and served green tea. I rubbed my sore 
knees, unused to squatting on a tatami mat. Takashi, an in-law who is also a 
rice farmer, lifted his beer for a toast. "To your coming from the United 
States," he said, "for health and good fortune -- kanpai!" 
</P>
<P>
Michiko, who was the closest of our Japanese relatives to my grandmother, 
described her as "a beautiful person . . . very intelligent." 
</P>
<P>
Grandma often wrote to her relatives in Japan from Los Angeles and Manzanar. 
She ended her letters with graceful lines of tanka and haiku poetry, using the 
kanji characters of a learned man. 
</P>
<P>
Like De Tocqueville, she penned vivid descriptions of hardships in the strange 
new land. She was a "picture" bride betrothed to my grandfather, an immigrant 
farmer. She feared her children would lose their Japanese values. And she 
alluded to her new religion, Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
I told our cousins that Grandma Iwata was introduced to the Methodist Church by 
a Japanese missionary. One day the zealous missionary, quoting Exodus ("Thou 
shalt have no other gods before me"), snatched Grandma's small Buddhist altar 
from the bedroom dresser and burned it in a field. 
</P>
<P>
Our relatives nodded. Pained looks crossed their faces. 
</P>
<P>
I asked, "Did obasan write why she no longer believed in Buddhism?" 
</P>
<P>
No, not at all, said Michiko, shaking her head. We fell silent. 
</P>
<P>
Our afternoon ended amid a flurry of snapshots. We held up the Noguchi family 
crest, which was emblazoned on a large cloth banner. I gave Michiko a book of 
poetry that Grandma Iwata wrote 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
She bowed and thanked us profusely, cradling the book to her chest as if it 
were a precious gem. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, we drove to Masao's large home and Japanese-style guest house 
with gabled roofs. This is the Iwata honke -- where our family began. A century 
ago, my late grandfather, Yasujiro Iwata, was born here, as were his father and 
grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
The Iwatas had started planting this year's crop of rice seeds, but a light 
rain kept us from touring the muddy fields bordering the 200-acre farm -- huge 
by Japanese standards. 
</P>
<P>
My parents rushed indoors. I lingered outside, standing in the country road, 
breathing the humid air. I tried to grasp this moment, sear it in my memory. I 
wished I could somehow embrace the quiet thrill as if it were a lover or a 
Christmas gift. 
</P>
<P>
Tired and dirty, we soaked ourselves in the o-furo, a Japanese bath in the main 
house. I lay in the hot bath for a long time, listening to the patter of 
raindrops on the roof. I could die naked and happy in Wakayama. 
</P>
<P>
Masao and his gracious wife, Akiko-san, cooked us a princely meal. Besides the 
sukiyaki, we gobbled down o-kayu (soft rice cooked in tea), jako (a local 
fish), gobo (burdock root) and other country-style dishes I haven't eaten since 
my grandmothers died. 
</P>
<P>
Later that night in the living room, we pored through pages of the family 
history. Portraits of Iwata ancestors hung near our heads. One photograph was 
of a relative who died as a pilot in the Imperial Army during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Grandfather Iwata was a smart, serious young man. He was among a handful of 
villagers who wrote in English. Books in hand, he studied daily with Buddhist 
monks at the old Shingon-shu temple a block away. He was also a natural farmer 
who had "a good sense of the land," Masao said. Relatives recalled Grandpa, 
tall and gaunt, trudging through the rice fields from dawn to dusk. 
</P>
<P>
Wakayama, like much of rural Japan in the 1800s, was struck by poverty. There 
were always shortages of rice and other crops. As a side business, the Iwata 
family raised silkworms on their farm and sold raw silk. 
</P>
<P>
Grandpa Iwata was distressed by the poor state of his village. Vowing to return 
after striking it rich, the wide-eyed young man sailed to the United States in 
1898. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, my grandfather used his farming knowledge in the dry soil of the 
San Fernando Valley. Japanese immigrants and white bankers sought his help to 
start orange orchards. 
</P>
<P>
After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Grandpa and Grandma were forced to sell their 
small farm when the military "evacuation" order was issued. 
</P>
<P>
Grandpa Iwata never returned to Japan. And no one recalled him ever writing. 
But the Wakayama villagers still spoke proudly of him. "Yasujiro was the best 
farmer in Wakayama," said Masao, nodding. "We also hear he was the best farmer 
in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Before we left Wakayama the next day, our relatives took us to two cemeteries. 
We must see the family gravestones before we return to America, Masao insisted. 
</P>
<P>
One cemetery, a Shinto graveyard, was hidden on a hillside in a dark bamboo 
grove. We hiked along a rice paddy and a muddy trail to reach it. Red-aproned 
little statues, symbolizing the gods of dead children, guarded the entrance. We 
poured water over the family headstone to purify it, clapped twice and prayed. 
</P>
<P>
The other cemetery was behind the Buddhist temple where Grandpa Iwata 
worshiped. Our family tombstone, a large gray slab, sat in the middle of the 
graveyard. My great-grandfather rests here. 
</P>
<P>
"In our world, he was known as Matsujiro . . ." read the kanji chiseled into 
the stone. 
</P>
<P>
I told my stoic dad, "Grandpa is here." He touched the gravestone and nodded 
without a word. My father never met his grandfather until now. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of miles away in Okayama, at another sacred place of worship, we 
prayed for the souls of my mother's ancestors. The Kunitomis, I learned, have a 
proud history spanning three centuries. 
</P>
<P>
We went to the Kannon Shrine, one of the oldest Shinto shrines in Japan. The 
spirits of ancient emperors watch over the 1,600-year-old hillside site. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where your grandparents' spirits are at peace," said our relative, 
Kusuyuki, a short, impish man and a rice farmer. "I always prayed here for your 
Grandma when she was in America." 
</P>
<P>
The Kunitomi family has worshiped at this revered shrine for generations. After 
Grandma Komika Kunitomi's funeral six years ago in Los Angeles, half of her 
ashes, hair and nails were sent here. 
</P>
<P>
In prewar Los Angeles in Little Tokyo, Grandma Kunitomi taught her children to 
be proud of their name. She also told colorful stories about her girlhood in 
Okayama, catching fish and crayfish in the creek behind her house. But the 
tales always circled back to our ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
"You come from a fine family," she told her kids. 
</P>
<P>
One of our cousins, Kiyoshi, a high school principal, started tracing the 
family lineage. His decade of detective work led him from local graveyards to 
government archives to temple and shrine records. 
</P>
<P>
"Our family tree is not forged like many other genealogies," said Kiyoshi, 
relaxing at the rice farm of Kinichi Kunitomi, the head of the family on my 
mother's side. 
</P>
<P>
Kiyoshi believes 12 of our ancestors fought for Lord Ikeda and Lord Togawa, two 
barons who ruled feudal Okayama in the 18th Century. Two ancestors were 
low-ranking officers: Genzaemon helped command soldiers armed with guns, while 
Chuzaemon led a horse brigade. 
</P>
<P>
For their years of loyalty, the two Kunitomi officers were rewarded with large 
rice payments and plots of land. One of the lords also gave his faithful 
retainers a surname -- a rare honor in that time. Kunitomi means land of 
wealth. 
</P>
<P>
"These kinds of stories give us pride," Kiyoshi said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Kannon Shrine, the names of several Kunitomi ancestors are engraved on 
the cracked walls. The souls of benefactors and leaders are preserved in this 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it so important to trace the family history? I asked Kiyoshi. Does it 
really matter, whether we descended from revered warriors or nameless peasants? 
</P>
<P>
Kiyoshi, a stern gruff man, smiled in mild disbelief. "Americans . . . ," he 
muttered, adjusting his horn-rimmed glasses. 
</P>
<P>
"We learned about the importance of family from Confucius," he said, as if 
lecturing one of his students. "It is very important to respect one's 
ancestors. It is important to hand down that respect to the next generation." 
</P>
<P>
Do you expect me to help carry on this legacy? I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"You and your parents are Japanese inside," said Kiyoshi, cutting the air with 
his open palms. "It takes time for Japanese who leave Japan to become real 
Americans. . . . Maybe 100 years or more." 
</P>
<P>
Kiyoshi's words echoed in my mind. Did he really believe I am Japanese in my 
kokoro -- my heart and spirit? 
</P>
<P>
His thoughts clashed with my perception of myself. Throughout our journey I'd 
felt like a schizophrenic creature. The strong-minded American inside was 
fighting to crack through the Japanese shell of conformity and reserve taught 
to me by my parents. 
</P>
<P>
During a talk with another cousin, I impatiently pressed him for more detail 
and color. The Western journalist in me circled like a hawk sighting his prey. 
My translator, Ueno, finally lost his patience. 
</P>
<P>
"Your blood may be from Japan, but you are still a foreigner," he snapped at 
me. "You cannot expect your relatives to do more for you." 
</P>
<P>
Humbled by my friend, I felt like an outcast. An exile. A fake Japanese like 
the doctored family histories that tout a samurai ancestry. I wanted to vanish. 
</P>
<P>
Late one night in Okayama, I regained my sense of family and belonging. We were 
trading stories in Kusuyuki's small farmhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The man is a born ham, a Japanese Mickey Rooney. He showed us old pictures 
taken during my grandmother's trips to Japan on Buddhist pilgrimages. He 
proudly brought out the family crest that he paid $500 to have framed and 
gold-plated. 
</P>
<P>
Kusuyuki worried about the fate of the Kunitomi land. He's getting old. And the 
younger Kunitomis, who've left the farm, don't want to return. Eventually, he 
said, "he'll sell the rice fields to developers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pity," one old cousin, Masatoshi, had said as he recalled festivals 
that celebrated the rice crop and the passing of seasons. "Young people do not 
think about these things anymore. Do young Japanese-Americans think about these 
things?" 
</P>
<P>
My relatives aren't romantics yearning for a lost nostalgic past. They're proud 
farmers in mourning over the slow death of their rural culture, a culture that 
is increasingly out of step with Japan's new role as banker of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly Kusuyuki stopped chatting and looked sternly at me. "Your parents' era 
is ending," he said. "You must keep coming back to Japan to maintain the 
tradition." 
</P>
<P>
I promised him I'd return soon. 
</P>
<P>
A second translator, a young woman named Yoshimi Kai, joined us. At my urging, 
she read old letters mailed to our relatives by Grandma Kunitomi and my Aunt 
Choko after they settled in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The mountains in America are bare, not green," wrote Grandma to her family in 
the village of her birth. "I miss Okayama very much." 
</P>
<P>
One gloomy letter came from Aunt Choko a few years ago. Grandma Kunitomi had 
just died of illness and old age at a nursing home in Boyle Heights near East 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm clearing Bachan's things away and keeping busy," writes my aunt, who cared 
for Grandma in her last years. "But when things are quiet, I get very sad." 
</P>
<P>
My mother listened quietly, her lips trembling. She had never read these 
letters. Kai, her eyes tearing, asked for tissue. "Your aunt uses the kanji for 
kareru, which means dying away," said Kai. "It is a sad word that gives an 
image of loneliness and emptiness. She wants to say the Kunitomi family was 
once very prosperous. And now, years later, that is all fading away." 
</P>
<P>
In the darkened airliner, my mother and father slept like children. Their 
chests rose and fell gently to the drone of the jet's engine. I draped blankets 
over their laps to fend off the chill. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout our stay in Japan, I saw my mother's face glow with pride. She used 
her Japanese in an unashamed manner. For the first time, she felt the grace and 
power of a language that drew stares of curiosity or racial hatred in America. 
</P>
<P>
I saw my father, bored by retirement and losing his sense of purpose, 
rediscover his wonder of things. His gait and posture straightened. He spoke 
often in Japanese, joining conversations with a new vigor. In his sleep he even 
talks in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
As for myself? I feel proud, whole, more complete. My family history was not 
destroyed by the injustice of the internment camps. Our tales, our memories, 
stretch back generations. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, I'm thrilled that Japanese kangaekata, or ways of thinking, reflect 
feelings and values I've inherited from my parents and grandparents. Clearly, 
I'll never blend fully into the Japanese world with my clumsy American armor, 
but in small ways, I'm kin to the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
My hands cup several faded photographs of my ancestors. Clad in kimono and 
hakama (male skirts), they pose like clay figurines for the camera. Their gazes 
cross the reigns of emperors to reach an American descendant in the new Heisei 
Era, Year One. 
</P>
<P>
The jet lurched. I was suddenly hit by an onrush of sorrow. I rubbed my moist 
eyes and breathed deeply. But I could not fight off the feeling of sadness and 
loss, nor hold back the sharp pain. 
</P>
<P>
On our last night spent at his home, Kusuyuki had invited me back to Okayama. 
"Come live with us for a year," he said. "You will learn everything." I 
thought: Not nearly enough.

TIDAL WAVE REMOLDS A SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
THE IMMIGRATION SURGE THAT RESHAPED THE INNER CITY IS NOW TRANSFORMING THE 
SUBURBAN CAMPUS. BOTH PARENTS AND OFFICIALS ARE REELING. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Early each weekday morning, mothers and fathers throughout Tarzana load their 
children into tony sedans, wagons and Jeeps and drive off to private schools 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, from inner-city areas miles away, busloads of students who barely 
speak English arrive at the neighborhood public elementary school, Wilbur 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that everyone in my neighborhood went to Wilbur," lamented 
Tarzana parent Julie Engelman, on whose West San Fernando Valley street only 
one out of five families send children to the local school. "Now, no one goes 
there. . . . And the more neighborhood kids leave," she added with a note of 
frustration, "the more room there is for bused-in kids." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its reputation as a good school with a fine faculty, Wilbur lost about 
a dozen neighborhood students to private schools this year. The exodus sent 
shock waves through Wilbur's tight-knit parent community, and more parents say 
they may follow the trend to private schools. 
</P>
<P>
Across the sprawling, 610,000-student Los Angeles Unified School District, 
parent unrest over busing's impact on neighborhood schools has become a common 
theme. Because of a critical shortage of classroom seats and an ever-rising 
tide of immigrant children, the neighborhood school is undergoing drastic 
change. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no schools (in Los Angeles Unified) that just have neighborhood kids 
any longer," said Board of Education member Roberta Weintraub. "Today, the 
'neighborhood' encompasses the whole city of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
The scene is reminiscent of the late 1970s, when massive busing to achieve 
racial integration brought fundamental changes in the student body at scores of 
schools and, subsequently, drove thousands of white families out of the public 
school system. Many families returned when court-ordered busing ended in 1981. 
But today, parents in Tarzana and other suburban neighborhoods are reeling 
again, although for different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing massive wave of immigration to Los Angeles that has transformed 
the inner city finally is remolding the suburbs as well. And public schools are 
bearing the brunt of the demographic explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the children of a decade ago, most of the students being bused today are 
immigrants who need help in learning English. And they are being bused, not 
because of a mandate to desegregate, but because their home schools are too 
crowded to take them. 
</P>
<P>
Districtwide enrollment boomed through much of the last decade, growing by 
15,000 pupils last fall alone. Until recently, the burden of overcrowding was 
shouldered mainly by inner-city campuses, which sacrificed playgrounds for 
bungalows and switched to year-round schedules to accommodate the flood of new 
students. 
</P>
<P>
But having exhausted those alternatives -- and unable to build new classrooms 
quickly enough -- the district has turned to relief measures that ask suburban 
campuses to share the load. One such strategy is year-round schools for the 
entire district by 1991, approved by the Board of Education earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The other solution has been busing. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, 24,000 students -- roughly equal to the number of pupils in a 
district the size of Alhambra or Glendale -- are crisscrossing the Los Angeles 
school system's 600 square miles each weekday to reach an available classroom 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the morning and again in late afternoon, district buses rumble down 
the freeways, carrying students near and far -- from the East Valley to the 
West Valley, Bell to Bel-Air, South Gate to Canoga Park, South-Central Los 
Angeles to Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, 300 of the district's 600 elementary, junior and senior high 
campuses receive students who do not live in the neighborhood, with some 
filling up to half of their total enrollments with children from overcrowded 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Three schools have no neighborhood children, serving exclusively a bused-in 
student body. They include a regular elementary school in Sepulveda and two 
"newcomer centers" in Bel-Air and the Crenshaw district that help orient newly 
arrived immigrant children. 
</P>
<P>
Wilbur receives nearly half of its 700 students on buses from immigrant 
neighborhoods in downtown and South-Central Los Angeles. But it was so 
unprepared for the large number of limited-English-speaking children who 
arrived this year that teachers had to scramble for translators and supplies, 
students endured multiple classroom changes, and parents panicked. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real stress and strain on a school" when more than 50% of the students 
are bused in from many different areas, said Jack S. Jacobson, a district 
regional administrator for the West San Fernando Valley. When that happens, 
parents "begin to feel they are losing their neighborhood school." 
</P>
<P>
Parents from Wilbur have queued up to speak at Board of Education meetings 
nearly every week for the last few months, drawing attention to inadequate 
bilingual help, overcrowded and unsanitary restrooms, classroom disruptions and 
other perceived shortcomings of the busing. Similar complaints have been voiced 
in schools from Pacific Palisades to Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
Some district officials view such complaints as racially motivated, or at the 
least, shortsighted and selfish. 
</P>
<P>
Although some Wilbur parents "show genuine concern for all of the children in 
the school," said board member Rita Walters, who represents an inner-city 
region with many overcrowded schools, "in others, it is more limited." 
</P>
<P>
"The depressing side of it is that those voices and that energy are not raised 
to address the problems beyond the boundary of Wilbur Avenue School," she 
continued. "The problems at Wilbur are not very different from the problems of 
the whole district." 
</P>
<P>
Wilbur parents know that some administrators may view them as racists, but they 
staunchly reject the label. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid that is what people want to hear, so they can turn us off," said 
Garrie Katznelson, who removed her fourth-grade daughter from Wilbur late last 
year. "Our school has been integrated for years. We're talking about 
educational flight. Parents couldn't sit by and watch an excellent school 
disintegrate." 
</P>
<P>
Their chief complaint, the shortage of bilingual teachers and aides, reflects a 
districtwide problem. But the shortfall is particularly severe in schools that 
take in students from overcrowded campuses. 
</P>
<P>
A recent district study based on 1986-87 figures showed that more than half of 
the students bused that year lacked fluency in English and most were sent to 
schools that had few, if any, bilingual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
At Wilbur, nearly one-third of the students speak languages other than English 
-- largely Spanish, but also Korean, Armenian, Farsi, Portuguese, Hebrew and 
Cantonese. But the school has only two bilingual teachers fluent in Spanish and 
English. 
</P>
<P>
Parent Michele Kuznetsky, who has voiced concern over the inadequacy of 
bilingual help but has kept her son in Wilbur, said she welcomes such cultural 
diversity. "We want this kind of (integrated) education," she insisted. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, district figures show that Wilbur has had a significant minority 
enrollment for years because of a voluntary busing program that brings in black 
students from the inner city and the growth of Iranian and other immigrant 
groups in the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But the problem this year, Kuznetsky and others say, is that the number of 
bused youngsters who could not speak English jumped so dramatically -- 70 
arrived on one day alone -- that the school's resources were strained to the 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
Parents, as well as some teachers, also fear that the trend toward 
non-neighborhood enrollment undermines Wilbur as a place where parents and 
teachers all know each other and work together for the betterment of the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"We are losing the nucleus of our community," a veteran Wilbur teacher said. 
</P>
<P>
Even some academicians agree that the issue is a serious one. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing that makes a school operate, that makes a school hum, is a sense of 
community," said UCLA education professor Donald Erickson, who specializes in 
administrative and policy studies. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you simply bus people around at random and you've got 15 different 
languages in the school and parents (of bused youngsters) can't get involved in 
school affairs, there is no concept or theme or set of values that people can 
get together on," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of students participate in voluntary busing for integration purposes, 
and that "seems to work," Erickson added. But busing purely to relieve 
overcrowding is, he said, "madness." 
</P>
<P>
Nestled in a quiet residential area near two country clubs, Wilbur at one time 
enrolled 1,000 students, all from the Tarzana-Reseda area. Principal Frank 
Specchierla, who recently left on a sabbatical, said enrollment took a nose 
dive through the 1970s, in part because of parents' fears of mandatory 
desegregation and because sharply rising real estate prices discouraged 
families with young children from moving in. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Wilbur has a 50-member PTA board -- huge by today's standards. It is the 
kind of school where parents can throw a wine-and-cheese reception and raise 
$20,000 to outfit a computer lab, or generate another $25,000 through candy and 
T-shirt sales to pay for field trips, scholastic magazine subscriptions and 
other "enrichments" that were cut out of most school budgets years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"If we lose these parents, you can kiss that goodby. And (all of) the kids are 
going to lose out," said Dotty Spector, a PTA co-president. 
</P>
<P>
Even parents who have fled the school stress that they remain strong believers 
in public education. 
</P>
<P>
Katznelson, for example, taught public school for 17 years and attended public 
schools herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a public-school advocate," she declared over lunch in a bustling cafe near 
her Tarzana home recently. "I never imagined my children going to anything but 
a public school." 
</P>
<P>
But she changed her mind abruptly when her daughter's classroom was changed and 
she was seated next to students who barely spoke English in a class led by a 
teacher who could not speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the bused-in pupils arrived after "norm day," Oct. 6, the date 
by which schools had to turn in official enrollment counts and finalize their 
staffing needs, Specchierla said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the newcomers are recent immigrants from El Salvador, Nicaragua, Mexico 
and other Latin countries. Teachers note that some of the pupils had little 
prior schooling before immigrating to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilbur was far short of having enough bilingual teachers, aides or books. 
So teachers and students who spoke only English had difficulty communicating 
with the students who spoke mostly Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very hard," said fourth-grade teacher Donna Quan, whose inability to 
speak Spanish hampered teaching for half of her class of 29 students. "I have 
to ask the students who speak some English to help me out. That is 
frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, classes had to be reorganized several times because new students kept 
trickling in. Some neighborhood youngsters had to change teachers three times 
within the first two months of school. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter cried every day not knowing when she would be moved," said the 
mother of a fifth-grader who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
For Katznelson, the last straw was seeing her 8-year-old daughter's schoolwork 
deteriorate. Because the girl's limited-English-speaking classmates were 
constantly asking her questions -- What did the teacher say? What page are we 
on? How do you do this exercise? -- she didn't have time to finish her own 
work, her mother said. Katznelson said her daughter wanted to help them but, in 
the end, found the situation too exasperating. 
</P>
<P>
So last October, the Katznelsons decided to enroll their child in a nearby 
private school. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very difficult decision," recalled Katznelson, who had been one of 
the school's most active parent supporters. "I always felt the finest teachers 
were in public schools. . . . But the quality of education had gone down. Not 
because of the teachers -- the teachers are outstanding. But I feel they were 
put in an impossible situation, and it affected everybody, all of the 
children." 
</P>
<P>
Malka Tasoff, a leader of the ad hoc group Parents of Wilbur, which has 
pressured the school board to help the school, said parents would like 
assurances that no additional children will be bused in next year, to give the 
school time to adjust to this year's sudden influx. 
</P>
<P>
"At least let them be bused to a school that is working," she said. "Don't 
chase away the people (neighborhood parents) who make it work." 
</P>
<P>
Tasoff's two children continue to attend Wilbur. But she notes that eight of 
the 11 children living on her street, Pasadero Drive, go to private schools. 
</P>
<P>
"That kills me," she said. "There ought to be a campaign by the school district 
to pull these people in. They are an incredible resource for the school. Wilbur 
is a poor school, but what made it a model is parental involvement." 
</P>
<P>
Parents acknowledge that conditions are slowly improving. More bilingual aides 
have been hired and additional bilingual materials finally arrived early this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, in part because of the parents' protests, the district recently 
established a centralized system for recruiting bilingual classroom aides. 
Wilbur Principal Specchierla said finding qualified candidates was so difficult 
in the West Valley that last year he resorted to hanging around a local 
unemployment office to find a Spanish-speaking aide. 
</P>
<P>
Wilbur parents continue to devote considerable energy to attracting 
neighborhood children back to Wilbur, however, believing that building up the 
local enrollment will go a long way toward remedying the school's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Critics suggest that the parents ought to pay more attention to accepting the 
idea that inner-city children are, and will continue to be, a part of their 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Bonita Perez, a multicultural education specialist for the office of the Los 
Angeles County superintendent of schools, has worked with many Los Angeles-area 
schools where students are bused in because of overcrowding. Although she was 
not speaking specifically of Wilbur, she contended that at many such schools, 
human relations are ignored. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids who are bused in walk in like tourists," she said. "What is done to 
make them feel they are a part of the school and belong there? And what is done 
to help the neighborhood kids feel comfortable receiving and accepting them? 
Little to nothing, most often." 
</P>
<P>
Perez noted that at many schools, neighborhood students walk in through the 
main gate while the bused youngsters arrive through a separate entrance nearer 
to where their buses stop. "There is division right there at the start," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At Wilbur, the bused students enter through a gate near the parking lot and 
walk directly to the cafeteria for the free hot breakfast most are qualified to 
receive. They also sit together for a subsidized lunch. 
</P>
<P>
And out on the playground, fifth-grade teacher Polly McDowell said, "there is 
almost total segregation. The black kids have their own little group and the 
Spanish kids go into their little groups. It's comfortable for them." 
</P>
<P>
McDowell said she is concerned about the "isolation" of the bused youngsters. 
"There are certain things," she said, "that make you feel inferior." 
</P>
<P>
Some neighborhood students reach out to the newcomers. Andrew Kim, 10, a 
Korean-American student in Paul Greenwalt's fifth-grade bilingual classroom, 
brings a Spanish-English dictionary to school to help him communicate with his 
Spanish-speaking classmates. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're out on the yard, I hear kids say things in Spanish and I look it 
up. When the teacher says (a command) in English, I say it in Spanish. 
Sometimes I help Rosa here," he said, motioning toward a girl sitting across 
the table from him. 
</P>
<P>
Kim's classmate, Sonia Martinez, who rides the bus to Wilbur from South-Central 
Los Angeles, said she likes the school but would rather attend classes closer 
to home. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be near my house," she said, because "if something (bad) happens, I 
can go home." 
</P>
<P>
A Guatemala native who has attended Wilbur for three years, Sonia said she 
feels comfortable at the school; she serves as a bus monitor and cafeteria 
helper, and is even considering becoming a teacher when she grows up. But she 
cannot stay late or join in after-school activities because the bus leaves 
promptly after the last bell at 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
That is a common lament of students who must ride the buses to distant 
campuses, and it presents one more barrier between the traveling and the 
neighborhood students, parents and teachers alike said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, language differences, work schedules and the long distance between 
home and school make it difficult for the parents of the traveling students to 
become involved in school affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Parent leaders at Wilbur say they have tried to reach out to their counterparts 
in the sending schools, such as through letters home in Spanish about PTA 
meetings. But so far the response has been discouraging. 
</P>
<P>
A few schools have tried to schedule parent meetings at schools closer to the 
neighborhoods the pupils travel from, "but I haven't heard of schools with 
overwhelming success," said Gordon Wohlers, the district administrator in 
charge of overcrowding-relief programs, such as busing. "Obviously, the 
deterrent is the distance." 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the district busing program mention those and other problems when 
they argue that the greatest hardships are being borne by the students riding 
the buses, not by neighborhood youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Associate Supt. Paul Possemato, who is studying Wilbur parents' complaints, 
said parents who fear that their children lose valuable learning time when they 
try to help a limited-English classmate may not have a legitimate complaint: "I 
find that difficult to understand, instructionally. There is tremendous benefit 
in that kind of cooperative relationship." 
</P>
<P>
One finding of a recent report by the district's Program Assessment and 
Evaluation Branch shows that the academic achievement of pupils bused to 
integrated schools is much lower than that of neighborhood students. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been complaining about these things for years," said the Rev. Horacio 
Quinones, who heads the Parent Academy for Quality Education, a grass-roots 
effort to train Latino parents to be more involved in schools. "The difference 
now is that the ones complaining are the receiving schools, who say we are 
lowering their academic achievement. So they're getting the attention. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you do not deal with the Hispanic community, the end result is that 
everybody is going to be affected. Our children are not going to go away."

<P>
As early as 1972, the U.S. government was so concerned about what it saw as 
Manuel Noriega's role in drug trafficking in Panama that it formulated an 
option to assassinate him. It was no idle contingency plan: A CIA operative was 
actually dispatched to Mexico to await final orders before the plot was finally 
scotched, according to a former U.S. intelligence official. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until 16 years later that the United States found more acceptable 
means of dealing with Noriega -- highly unusual criminal indictments of the 
foreign leader on charges that he protected drug traffickers and helped launder 
their illegal profits. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1988, when Noriega was indicted simultaneously by federal grand 
juries in Miami and Tampa, Fla., he had risen from the rank of colonel in his 
country's national guard to maximum leader of Panama, and few thought he would 
be brought to trial. Little public attention was focused on the merits of the 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, after Noriega's surrender to U.S. authorities in the wake of an 
invasion that cost the lives of 23 American soldiers and hundreds of 
Panamanians, the case behind the indictments is coming under mounting scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys in the Miami case and other legal experts have criticized the 
government's reliance on testimony by admitted drug dealers whose stories have 
won them reduced sentences. Elements within the U.S. government opposed the 
investigations from the outset, and some senior officials still raise doubts 
privately about the strength of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
But sources familiar with the evidence say prosecutors have strong 
corroboration for much of the testimony, including key surveillance reports by 
the Drug Enforcement Administration confirming critical aspects of the 
smugglers' stories. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Manuel A. Noriega is months from trial and, the specifics of the evidence 
aside, legitimate questions can be raised about U.S. actions in the case: If 
Noriega was as corrupt as the government claims, why did it take so long to 
charge him and why did U.S. agencies rely on him? Did rivalry between two 
politically savvy U.S. attorneys result in two indictments when one would have 
been stronger? Were prosecutors pushed into hasty indictments by looming Senate 
probes? 
</P>
<P>
Definitive answers to those questions may remain a mystery even after Noriega's 
trials. But thousands of pages of documents and dozens of interviews with 
figures close to the investigations have yielded some insights -- as well as 
the story behind the indictments that brought down a dictator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Drug Record 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 5, 1971, John Ingersoll, the director of the Bureau of Narcotics and 
Dangerous Drugs, the predecessor to the DEA, prepared a report that found 
Panama "one of the most significant countries for the transshipment of 
narcotics into the United States." 
</P>
<P>
An earlier secret report by a BNDD staffer had identified Noriega, then a 
lieutenant colonel in the national guard, as being in control of the drug 
trafficking in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Early in 1972, the BNDD created a list of options for dealing with Noriega, the 
most extreme of which called for his assassination. Ingersoll has said he 
rejected the idea out of hand, but apparently it found some adherents in the 
Richard M. Nixon Administration. 
</P>
<P>
John Bacon, a CIA analyst who was on loan to BNDD in 1972, said in an interview 
that a member of the White House "plumbers unit" was sent to Mexico to await 
further orders on the assassination. The plan was eventually aborted and the 
operative was recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Even at the time killing him was under consideration, Noriega was providing 
information to the CIA and military-intelligence agencies and receiving money 
in return. The information was apparently deemed so valuable that U.S. 
officials were willing to overlook other aspects of Noriega's activities. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, U.S. intelligence agencies were aware that Noriega was also 
passing along information to Cuban leader Fidel Castro. And in 1976, he was 
believed to have arranged a series of car bombings of U.S. targets in Panama in 
an attempt to soften the U.S. position on ownership of the Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, George Bush was director of Central Intelligence in the Gerald R. 
Ford Administration. The CIA was concerned enough about the bombings to summon 
Noriega to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
According to an account in a new book, "Our Man In Panama" by John Dinges, Bush 
met with Noriega at lunch in December, 1976, at the Panamanian Embassy here and 
listened with little comment to Noriega's denial that Panama was connected with 
the bombings. 
</P>
<P>
During the Jimmy Carter Administration, Noriega strengthened his ties with 
military-intelligence units, and two inquiries into allegations of corruption 
were stalled. 
</P>
<P>
The first roadblock came soon after Carter negotiated the treaty to turn over 
the Panama Canal to Panama. The treaty encountered opposition from 
conservatives in the Senate, and Republican foes of the agreement sought the 
DEA's files on drug dealings in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Bacon, who had by this time signed on full time at DEA, said he boxed up the 
files and turned them over to DEA lawyers. The files never reached the Senate, 
and Bacon said they disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors in Miami also found themselves blocked when they tried to 
charge Noriega with buying and transporting weapons illegally in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
R. Jerome Sanford, an assistant U.S. attorney at the time, said in an interview 
that the Customs Service had developed evidence that Noriega was involved in 
smuggling guns out of Miami to the Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua, who were 
fighting to overthrow Gen. Anastasio Somoza. 
</P>
<P>
Sanford said he was told later that Noriega was providing security for the Shah 
of Iran, who had been given haven in Panama at the request of the United 
States, and that his indictment would embarrass the Administration. The charges 
were never filed. 
</P>
<P>
Along with his ties to intelligence agencies, Noriega also developed a close 
relationship with the DEA during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Over the 
years, he was showered with letters of praise from DEA directors for his 
cooperation in cracking down on drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
But Noriega was cautioned by U.S. officials on various occasions as allegations 
about his corruption continued to filter back to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 1, 1985, he was summoned to Washington for a meeting with CIA Director 
William J. Casey. U.S. officials were deeply concerned about reports that 
Noriega had engineered the brutal torture and murder two months earlier of Hugo 
Spadafora, a former Panamanian official who had publicly denounced Noriega's 
drug dealings. 
</P>
<P>
"Noriega was brought up here to be read the riot act, and Casey failed," said 
Elliott Abrams, then an assistant secretary of state. "The fact that Casey did 
not read him the riot act meant that Noriega would certainly interpret it as a 
real honor." 
</P>
<P>
A month later, John M. Poindexter, President Ronald Reagan's national security 
adviser, went to Panama for another session. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega arrived for the meeting with Poindexter at Howard Air Base in Panama in 
a new Lincoln Continental and listened morosely as the U.S. official warned him 
about corruption, drug dealing and the expanding power of the military in 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Abrams, who accompanied Poindexter, recalled that Noriega said he was innocent 
and that the Americans were listening to the wrong people in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pilot Turns Informant 
</P>
<P>
Richard D. Gregorie had not been chief of narcotics prosecutions for long in 
the Miami office of the U.S. attorney before he began to hear Noriega's name. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, DEA agents in Miami nabbed Adler Barrimore (Barry) Seal, a former 
Special Forces pilot in the Vietnam War who had amassed a fortune flying drug 
shipments for the Colombians. To avoid a long jail term, Seal became the 
nation's top drug informant. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the DEA sent Seal to Panama for a meeting with Pablo Escobar and Jorge 
Ochoa, two leaders of the Medellin drug cartel who were hiding there after 
ordering the assassination of Colombian Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla. 
</P>
<P>
When Seal returned, he reported that Ochoa and Escobar were living in a Panama 
City hotel under Noriega's protection, according to government sources. Seal 
reported that Noriega had also allowed the cartel to set up a cocaine lab in 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Seal was killed by Colombian gunmen on a street in Baton Rouge, La., 
after his information had led to the indictment of Ochoa, Escobar and others. 
By then, the Miami investigators were pursuing other leads toward Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
A year earlier, DEA agent Danny Moritz had gone undercover as a money launderer 
and grown friendly with a Panamanian pilot, Floyd Carlton Caceres. An informant 
had told Moritz that Carlton was linked to Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1985, acting on a tip, DEA agents intercepted a load of Colombian 
cocaine. The plane made a crash landing on Interstate 75 north of Miami, and 
the pilot escaped. The DEA found 400 kilograms of cocaine on board. The seizure 
formed the basis for indicting the plane's pilot, Antonio Aizprua, and the man 
behind the shipment, Floyd Carlton. 
</P>
<P>
Moritz came to Gregorie, who was then chief assistant U.S. attorney, and told 
him: "I think I can make a case on Noriega." 
</P>
<P>
There were two problems, however. The first was nabbing Carlton, who had fled 
the United States after the seizure. 
</P>
<P>
At the time Moritz was looking for him, Carlton was talking with DEA agents in 
Panama City. He was frightened because Colombian drug dealers thought he had 
stolen a cocaine shipment, and they had beaten one of his relatives while 
searching for him. 
</P>
<P>
In Senate testimony in 1988, Carlton said he contacted two DEA agents in Panama 
City in January, 1986, to seek protection for himself and his family in 
exchange for information about Noriega. He described being driven around in a 
car by the agents and telling them about money laundering and drug dealing in 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"When I mentioned the name of Gen. Noriega, they immediately became upset," 
Carlton said, adding that the agents never contacted him again. 
</P>
<P>
Later that year, Moritz arranged to lure Carlton to Costa Rica on the pretense 
of a drug deal, and he was arrested. In jail, he described his role as the 
middleman between Noriega and the Medellin cartel. Among other things, he said 
that he had arranged their $4-million payment to Noriega for protection after 
the Lara Bonilla assassination. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1987, Carlton was extradited to the United States. By June, he had 
reached an agreement to cooperate with the Miami investigation in return for 
leniency. 
</P>
<P>
Moritz had been transferred to Cleveland, despite Gregorie's protests. So for 
four weeks that summer, DEA agents Steven Grilli and Alberto Fernandez 
questioned Carlton in a windowless room in the basement of the Miami federal 
courthouse known as "the submarine." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said Carlton felt betrayed because Noriega had failed to help him 
when the Colombians were after him the previous year. In telling his story, he 
provided extensive details of what he said was Noriega's involvement with the 
Colombian drug lords. But all those allegations would have to be corroborated. 
</P>
<P>
That was the second problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claims of Corruption 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors on Noriega's trail in Tampa, Fla., were hearing other claims of 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Steven Kalish had been arrested on charges from a Texas 
marijuana-smuggling operation. He also was under investigation in North 
Carolina, Louisiana and Florida. Faced with the new indictments and a lifetime 
in jail, Kalish began trying to cut a deal in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 21, 1986, Kalish's Washington lawyer, Samuel Buffone, met with 
prosecutors from North Carolina and Tampa in the U.S. attorney's office in 
Tampa. Buffone said his client could provide direct evidence of Noriega's 
involvement in laundering millions of dollars for Kalish's smuggling operation. 
He said that his client had given Noriega $300,000 in cash in a briefcase and 
that Noriega had used Kalish's jet for several trips, including one to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first time we'd heard of Noriega's involvement," said J. Douglas 
McCullough, the federal prosecutor from Raleigh heading the North Carolina 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The problem again was finding a way to substantiate the Kalish story. Kalish 
had something to offer on that score: flight logs from the times Noriega had 
used his Lear jet and records of the trip to Panama when he made the alleged 
$300,000 payoff. 
</P>
<P>
A second meeting was held on Sept. 19, 1986, at a closed, secluded campground 
at Camp Lejeune, a Marine base in North Carolina. McCullough and several FBI 
and DEA agents obtained a more detailed briefing from Kalish. 
</P>
<P>
Four days later, McCullough and the two Tampa prosecutors on the case, Mark 
Jackowski and Robert Kennedy, met with Justice Department officials in 
Washington. Robert Merkle, the U.S. attorney in Tampa, also flew up to discuss 
the potential Kalish deal with Stephen S. Trott, then associate attorney 
general in charge of the criminal division. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the Merkle-Trott meeting, the three assistant prosecutors were 
brought into the room, and McCullough recalled Trott telling them: "It's in 
your hands. You make the decision." 
</P>
<P>
The corroboration that sealed the deal for Kalish, according to McCullough and 
others, was DEA surveillance reports that placed him in Panama at the time he 
claimed to have given Noriega the $300,000. Coupled with the records that 
Kalish had provided, prosecutors felt confident that they had a strong case. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it would be months before the indictment was handed down. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Probe Hits Resistance 
</P>
<P>
The Miami prosecutors were having a tougher time of it. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1987, Gregorie went to Washington to discuss the investigation with 
officials at DEA headquarters and the Justice Department. He got a cool 
reception at the DEA. A few months earlier, John C. Lawn, DEA administrator, 
had written an effusive letter to Noriega praising his assistance in a major 
seizure of drugs and cash. 
</P>
<P>
In the meeting with Gregorie, Lawn was cooperative and helpful, but Thomas G. 
Byrne, the agency's intelligence chief, opposed the investigation openly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm used to agents being gung-ho to make a case and all of the sudden here was 
this guy Byrne saying: 'The case stinks, you are not going to be able to make 
it,' " Gregorie recalled in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
A senior DEA official explained in a recent interview that the DEA intelligence 
division was particularly protective of Noriega because he provided them with 
so much information about drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"They felt this guy was the only game around," the official said. "And they 
would ask: 'Who else is helping us?' " 
</P>
<P>
Gregorie was aware that some people in the Justice Department also opposed the 
investigation, but he said he was never overtly blocked at the Justice 
Department or the DEA. Merkle's recollections were similar. 
</P>
<P>
"There were people that clearly were not happy, mostly at DEA headquarters in 
Washington," he said. "It was a more of a sense than anything. It's like 
sitting at the table with a guy who has indigestion." 
</P>
<P>
A few days after Gregorie returned to Miami, he got a big break. Grilli, the 
DEA agent on the Miami case, received a call from an analyst in DEA 
intelligence who had spotted a debriefing report on a Colombian trafficker 
jailed in Oklahoma. The suspect was cooperating in another case and had 
mentioned Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The prisoner, Boris Olarte, said that he had paid $4 million to Noriega on 
behalf of the drug cartels in 1984, the same period Carlton claimed Noriega was 
receiving protection money. Olarte provided other details that corroborated 
Carlton's story. 
</P>
<P>
Before the end of the year, investigators had another big break when they 
interviewed Jose I. Blandon, a former political adviser to Noriega who had 
turned on the general. 
</P>
<P>
Blandon's most intriguing tale was his story that Castro had negotiated a truce 
between the Medellin cartel and Noriega after Noriega provided the DEA with 
information that led to the seizure of a cocaine lab the Colombians were 
building in Panama. The lab was supposed to have been protected as part of the 
$4-million payoff in 1984, Blandon said. He even provided pictures of Castro 
and Noriega together. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressure From Senate 
</P>
<P>
As the Tampa and Miami investigations were nearing their conclusions, pressure 
came from another quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Two Senate subcommittees -- the permanent subcommittee on investigations and 
the subcommittee on terrorism and narcotics -- had opened investigations into 
whether 
</P>
<P>
foreign-policy considerations were handcuffing the drug war. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Rinzel, chief counsel to the Republicans on the investigations 
subcommittee, was eager to put Kalish before the senators to tell his story. 
The hearing had been stalled by the Justice Department's unwillingness to allow 
access to its witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"It was important to the Justice Department attorneys that they return an 
indictment prior to congressional hearings because they did not wish to appear 
to be merely responding to congressional revelations," Rinzel said. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Blum, the chief counsel to the terrorism and narcotics panel, had delayed 
his inquiry for several months at the request of the Justice Department. But by 
January, 1988, he had interviewed Blandon and was eager to hold his hearings on 
the U.S. relationship with Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"How could it have gone on for so many years?" asked Blum in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Critics contend that the Senate inquiries rushed the indictments. One of the 
prosecutors conceded that Miami officials wanted their indictment before the 
Senate hearings added another layer of politics to the case. And Merkle 
acknowledged that he was concerned about the Senate hearings, but he said: 
"That concern was not a predicate for an untimely indictment." 
</P>
<P>
The cases were sharply different. Tampa relied primarily on Kalish's 
allegations of Noriega's role in money laundering to bring charges against 
Noriega and an associate, Enrique A. Pretelt. 
</P>
<P>
The Miami case was much broader, alleging that Noriega had extensive dealings 
with the Medellin cartel, protecting traffickers and their drugs and 
laboratories and allowing them to use Panamanian banks. Along with Noriega, 
charges were contemplated against members of the cartel and others. 
</P>
<P>
Questions had been simmering within the Justice Department over whether there 
would be one indictment or two. While Leon Kellner, the U.S. attorney in Miami, 
and Merkle cooperated in the parallel investigations, a hot rivalry existed 
between the men and their offices. Neither was willing to give up a 
high-profile case. 
</P>
<P>
Merkle, who is now in private practice, said there were sound reasons for two 
cases, including avoiding putting all of the government's eggs in one basket. 
He also said the cases were drawn differently. 
</P>
<P>
"Tampa is a very tight indictment, very clean and direct," he said. "Miami is 
almost a policy statement." 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 1, 1988, the two teams of prosecutors arrived in Washington to go over 
the proposed indictments with Trott and get final approval from Atty. Gen. 
Edwin Meese III. 
</P>
<P>
The primary weakness was that Noriega could argue that his activities were part 
of his work as an agent of various U.S. agencies. The prosecutors had not been 
allowed to examine the intelligence files of the various agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition still remained in the Reagan Administration. At a meeting with 
National Security Council officials, one said to Kellner: "I never understood 
that the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida was going to make 
foreign policy," according to a participant in the meeting who recalled Kellner 
responding: "I don't make foreign policy. I indict dope dealers." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition and the inability of the prosecutors to determine the 
extent of Noriega's relationship with U.S. intelligence operations, the 
decision was made to indict Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 4, 1988, Kellner and Merkle announced the two indictments at a crowded, 
joint press conference in Miami. Representatives of the FBI and customs, which 
had played major roles in the Tampa investigation, were there. Two chairs left 
for the DEA agents involved in the Miami case were empty.

FOR AMTRAK NO. 581, IT WAS JUST A BAD DAY ALL AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BEENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a day Amtrak would rather forget, a commuter's nightmare, a story of 
mishap and misfortune on northbound train No. 581. 
</P>
<P>
And before it was over, about 500 Amtrak passengers had spent almost three 
hours sitting dead still on the tracks -- without air conditioning -- because 
of a faulty locomotive air compressor, a broken-down van and a clock-watching 
crew that refused to take the train into Union Station in downtown Los Angeles 
because their workday had ended. 
</P>
<P>
The engineer remained at his controls. The conductor and two assistants who 
punch tickets sat down and waited. Rules were rules. Federal law forbade them 
to work a second longer. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that everything that could have gone wrong did," said Renee Banks, an 
Amtrak public affairs spokeswoman in Washington. "This certainly is an 
unfortunate incident. It really doesn't happen that often." 
</P>
<P>
It all started innocently enough after the train left San Diego, on time, at 
2:45 p.m. Friday for what should have been a 2-hour and 50-minute commute to 
Union Station. It didn't take long before things began to fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
First, the locomotive's air compressor failed just outside Oceanside, shutting 
off electrical power to the passenger and dining cars. The train slowed to a 
stop at 3:45 p.m. and sat there, without lights or air conditioning, for almost 
90 minutes as temperatures hovered in the high 70s. 
</P>
<P>
The Amtrak locomotive was dead, so national railway system officials urgently 
searched for a replacement to rescue the stranded passengers. In desperation, 
Amtrak turned to the Santa Fe Railway, which leased it a locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
As the passengers waited patiently, the new locomotive was connected and the 
journey north into Orange and Los Angeles counties resumed. 
</P>
<P>
But the locomotive, intended for pulling freight trains, proved to be much 
slower, Banks said, further adding to the delay. The train chugged on, making 
stops in San Juan Capistrano, Santa Ana and Fullerton before heading into its 
final run into Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers began looking at their watches, realizing that they would be late, 
but not knowing what was to come next. They didn't realize that the crewmen 
were also looking at their watches. 
</P>
<P>
The train suddenly came to a halt in Pico Rivera, miles from the closest Amtrak 
station. 
</P>
<P>
The crew had stopped the train because of a federal law called the Hours of 
Service Act. A safety-conscious Congress had passed the law to make sure that 
railroad workers do not stay on the job too long without rest. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew they weren't going to make it into L.A.," Banks said. "The crew 
really didn't know how late they would be. The problem was with the freight 
locomotive, which significantly slowed down the train. 
</P>
<P>
"They were only 11 miles out of Los Angeles when the clock ran out," she added. 
</P>
<P>
The crew, she said, notified Amtrak that a replacement crew would have to meet 
the train short of Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
A emergency replacement crew was rounded up and sent out in a van to meet the 
train at a Santa Fe Railway yard -- but the train never made it that far. The 
clock had run out and the engineer had shut down the locomotive short of the 
rail yard. 
</P>
<P>
When they learned the train had stopped in Pico Rivera, Banks said, the 
replacement crew members jumped back into their van. 
</P>
<P>
"But the van wouldn't start," Banks said. "It broke down." 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak No. 581 was stuck again. 
</P>
<P>
The replacement crew could not get the van to start, so they piled into an 
Amtrak superintendent's car and sped off to Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
Banks said it was another hour before the new crew arrived at the train, and 
with the old crew now seated with the passengers, guided the train into Union 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
The train pulled in at 8:27 p.m. -- nearly six hours after leaving San Diego -- 
or roughly the time it normally takes to commute from San Diego to Los Angeles 
and back. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the ordeal, Banks said, the passengers were frustrated and some were 
understandably angry, but most remained well-behaved. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hear of any problems," she said. "Obviously, the passengers on the 
train would be concerned if they were sitting there in the dark with no 
circulation or no air conditioning. I would be." 
</P>
<P>
At Union Station, Banks said, Amtrak officers were flooded with calls and 
questions from families and friends who had shown up -- at 5:25 p.m. -- to meet 
the train. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that they were obviously very concerned," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak No. 586, the southbound commuter to San Diego, left Union Station at 
10:40 p.m., almost two hours late.

Fresh from a narrow defeat in his bid for the state Senate, conservative 
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson has returned to his Newport Beach district only to 
find that he is facing a potentially tough reelection challenge from a GOP 
colleague. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson's opponent in the June 5 primary is the daughter of former Rep. Robert 
E. Badham, southern Orange County's congressman for 10 years. Phyllis Badham 
proudly says she is following in her father's footsteps by seeking to represent 
roughly the same Assembly district that launched his 26-year political career 
in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
At 30, Badham also notes that she is starting in politics at the same age as 
her father. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of respect for my father (in the district) and he has taught me 
to have respect for the system," Badham said. "I have a 10-year career in 
business and a thorough understanding of the political process. Given those 
ingredients, I am a game and talented opponent." 
</P>
<P>
Some political experts think Ferguson, 66, could be vulnerable because his 
outspoken conservatism may be out of step with his district. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when many pro-life politicians are trying to downplay their positions 
on the abortion issue, Ferguson has recruited the sometimes militant 
anti-abortion group Operation Rescue to help with his campaigns. And he 
recently made headlines when he used a slur against gays at one of his campaign 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Moderate Republicans have tried to defeat Ferguson before, but he has won 
decisively. In 1988, Ferguson beat back a primary challenge from Republican 
Newport Beach Councilwoman Evelyn Hart. He won 60% of the vote, compared to 
Hart's 33%. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson also demonstrated that he has a loyal following when he narrowly lost 
the Feb. 6 special primary to replace former state Sen. William Campbell 
(R-Hacienda Heights). With a strong showing in southern Orange County, Ferguson 
finished less than 1,000 votes behind Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier), who 
faces a runoff election in the 31st State Senate District race April 10. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson's 70th Assembly District is viewed as the most solidly Republican turf 
in California, with the GOP holding a commanding 61% to 27% lead over Democrats 
in voter registration. The district includes most of Orange County's southern 
coast, from Newport Beach to Dana Point and inland to Coto de Caza. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, seeking a fourth term in the Assembly, said he is disappointed by 
Badham's challenge, especially since he came to the aid of her father when 
Robert Badham faced a hostile primary opponent in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"We said at that time, 'You don't run against an incumbent,' " Ferguson said. 
"If you're a Republican and you want to stay in the party, you don't run." 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Badham said Thursday that he does not believe a contested primary is 
unhealthy for the party and that he was challenged by a fellow Republican in 
almost all of his 13 elections. 
</P>
<P>
Badham said he expects to do some fund raising for his daughter as well as 
provide political advice for the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Badham met last week in Sacramento with most of Orange County's 
legislative delegation to ask for its support -- or at least its neutrality. 
Republican Assembly leader Ross Johnson (R-La Habra) said the tone of the 
meeting was positive, but Badham's mission was unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
"We all made very clear that we would be supporting Gil and that . . . an 
unnecessary Republican primary did not make a lot of sense," Johnson said. 
"Obviously, she has every right to file and run a campaign, but that doesn't 
necessarily mean it is a smart thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Badham said she does not consider herself disloyal just because she thinks 
Republicans need a better representative in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the oil spill that soiled about 20 miles of Orange County coastline, 
including parts of Newport Beach, Badham said she plans to campaign heavily on 
environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that Ferguson was recently listed by the California League of 
Conservation Voters as one of the five worst legislators on environmental 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson responded that the conservation league is liberal-oriented and so 
"those lists don't mean very much." 
</P>
<P>
Badham said she will also campaign on her pro-choice stance on abortion because 
she believes her position has more support in the district than Ferguson's 
anti-abortion stance. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said his campaign theme in 1990 will be to simply remind voters of his 
record as their legislator since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to his constituents, he said, "I think on some issues I'm more 
conservative than they are . . . but I think 90% of what I do receives a very 
high approval rating. After six years of taking their pulse, receiving their 
votes and appearing at their forums, I think I really do reflect the majority 
of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Eileen Padberg, an Orange County Republican political consultant, said she 
thinks Ferguson is vulnerable. "I don't think this district is gung-ho Marine, 
like he is, (and) I think he's a little bit embarrassing in his comments," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Padberg said she believes that Ferguson can be beaten only by a determined, 
well-financed candidate because "when push comes to shove, the district just 
votes (for the) incumbent."

About 70 blocks of downtown Seattle lost electrical power for several hours 
Saturday after a fire in a transformer vault. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
The outage darkened hotel lobbies and shut down switching equipment for the 
Washington State Lottery, leaving many people unable to buy tickets on the 
night of a $6-million drawing, one of the state's largest. 
</P>
<P>
The area of the power outage encompassed Pike Place Market, several major 
department stores, the Seattle Aquarium and the Port of Seattle.

SCHOLASTIC UPGRADE PLAN ADOPTED; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: A GOVERNORS' TASK FORCE COMMITS TO BROAD STUDENT IMPROVEMENT, BUT 
FAILS TO ADDRESS FUNDING.

<P>
A National Governors' Assn. task force adopted a six-point program Saturday for 
upgrading American education by the start of the next century. But the group 
skirted what many educators and politicians consider the thorniest scholastic 
problem of all -- funding. 
</P>
<P>
The major points of the plan are expected to receive the approval of all of the 
governors attending the association's mid-winter conference, along with at 
least a qualified endorsement from President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The task force has been working in cooperation with White House aides. The 
governors will have dinner with Bush at the White House today, and they will 
meet again with the President on Monday. The conference ends Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The task force recommendations, an outgrowth of last fall's "education summit" 
between the President and the governors at the University of Virginia, cover a 
broad range of educational issues ranging from student performance to adult 
literacy. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina and Democratic Gov. 
Bill Clinton of Arkansas, co-chairmen of the task force, said the governors 
would defer a discussion of necessary funding until their July meeting in 
Mobile, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
But some observers at the conference contended that until the funding issue is 
resolved, the significance of the task force recommendations is problematic. 
</P>
<P>
"Without any further state or federal action (on financial support), these 
goals are unattainable," said Charles Casserly, legislative director for the 
Council of the Great City Schools, after reading the 13-page task force 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The task force report is the latest in a series of educational reform efforts 
undertaken in recent years by the association in response to the increasing 
difficulties faced by this country as it competes with other nations. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge facing us is to develop an education system that is second to 
none in the world, so that all Americans at all age levels are as well educated 
and as highly skilled as our competitors," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the report was devoted to fleshing out generalized goals for education 
in America. The broad goals had been endorsed previously by the governors and 
the White House and were cited by Bush in his State of the Union speech last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The six general issues laid out in the report address readiness for school, 
completion of secondary education, student achievement, mathematics and science 
education, adult literacy and drugs and violence in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Among the objectives for which increased federal help is proposed: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Head Start. The task force recommends giving all eligible children access 
to the government's Head Start program or equivalent preschool preparatory 
programs. Currently, fewer than 20% of eligible children are enrolled in Head 
Start. 
</P>
<P>
 -- School access. The report urges the federal government "to ensure access to 
quality educational programs for all students regardless of family income, 
race, national origin, or handicapped condition." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Higher education. Discussing financial help for low-income high school 
graduates seeking to attend college, the task force stated: "The federal 
government's role in ensuring access for qualified students is critical." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the atmosphere of bipartisan harmony that prevailed during most of the 
meeting, there were significant differences between Democratic governors eager 
for increased federal funding and Republicans more concerned about federal 
intrusion in local school systems. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want the federal government running education in South Carolina," said 
Campbell at one point during the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"You want the federal money, though, don't you?" Virginia's Democratic Gov. L. 
Douglas Wilder asked pointedly. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you can give me all of it that you don't want," Wilder responded. 
</P>
<P>
Hopes for White House backing were based on discussions between task force 
members and Roger B. Porter, Bush's chief domestic policy adviser; John H. 
Sununu, his chief of staff; Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, and Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get a consensus," association spokeswoman Rae Young Bond said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to recommending goals and objectives, the report urges creation of 
a system for assessing progress in attaining them. 
</P>
<P>
"National education goals will be meaningless unless progress toward meeting 
them is measured accurately and adequately," the report said.

SHUTTLE FLIGHT CALLED OFF JUST BEFORE LAUNCH; 
</P>
<P>
SPACE: A FAULTY COMPUTER FORCES NASA TO SCRUB THE SECRET MILITARY MISSION WITH 
31 SECONDS TO GO. THE LIFTOFF ALREADY HAD BEEN DELAYED THREE DAYS.

<P>
The scheduled launch of the space shuttle Atlantis, already delayed three times 
by an astronaut's illness and foul weather, was scrubbed again early today with 
31 seconds left in the countdown when a problem developed in a ground computer. 
</P>
<P>
NASA engineers raced against a six-minute clock -- the maximum time the flight 
could be delayed within the final seconds of the countdown -- in hopes that 
they could fix the malfunctioning computer, a range safety monitor that can 
destroy the shuttle if it strays too far off course and threatens populated 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Space agency officials said they were assessing whether the failed computer, 
and the weather, would permit a fifth launch try early Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds before NASA engineers ran out of time, the delay in the countdown had 
caused temperatures in the shuttle's main engines to drop too low to permit 
launch, driving a final nail in plans to proceed with liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
National Aeronautics and Space Administration workers had pumped 500,000 
gallons of fuel into Atlantis' external tank Saturday to ready the shuttle for 
flight. Once in orbit on a secret mission, the shuttle had been expected to put 
a photo-imaging spy satellite into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
A crew of five military astronauts was aboard Atlantis when the mission was 
scrubbed. It would have been the 34th flight of a U.S. space shuttle and the 
sixth shuttle flight entirely dedicated to a Defense Department mission. 
</P>
<P>
Commander John O. Creighton's scratchy throat and congestion had delayed the 
shuttle liftoff twice -- on Thursday and Friday mornings -- even as gusty winds 
and thunderstorms threatened to cause postponements. By Friday, NASA flight 
surgeons had cleared Creighton for flight, but torrential rains swept across 
Florida and grounded the shuttle on its launch pad for a third day in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Not since the Apollo 13 mission of April, 1970, had an astronaut's illness 
delayed a launch. NASA officials said Creighton's illness was not "anywhere 
near significant enough" to prompt his replacement. But they added that the 
space agency no longer trains back-up crews and would have had to scramble to 
find a new commander for Atlantis had Creighton's illness been more serious. 
</P>
<P>
At Kennedy Space Center alone, each day's delay costs $247,000 in labor and 
materials, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
While the Defense Department has shrouded Atlantis' payload in secrecy, experts 
said that the shuttle was to carry a $500-million satellite called the KH-12 
into space. The "keyhole" satellite would be the sixth in a constellation of 
U.S. craft designed to photograph and relay images of military and other 
installations, according to John Pike, a space expert with the Washington-based 
Federation of American Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
Gleaning information from the time and angle of the shuttle's launch, as well 
as from the rough weight of its payload, Pike and others are able to judge the 
purpose and capabilities of Atlantis' cargo. 
</P>
<P>
According to Aviation Week and Space Technology, an authoritative industry 
magazine, the 37,300-pound satellite also will carry eavesdropping equipment. 
</P>
<P>
From its projected orbit, the satellite is expected to come within photographic 
view of points as far north in the Soviet Union as Leningrad. In addition to 
helping monitor compliance to arms control agreements, such satellites would 
play a role in helping locate potential targets for nuclear attack.

CHENEY PREDICTS DIFFICULT TALKS ON PHILIPPINE BASES

Negotiations with the Philippines over continued U.S. use of six military bases 
there will be "very difficult" because of growing anti-American sentiment, 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney predicted Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to Washington from a two-week tour of Asian capitals, Cheney said 
that officials of the beleaguered government of President Corazon Aquino are 
reluctant to express support for the American bases because of the harsh 
domestic fallout from such a position. 
</P>
<P>
"I sense that the majority like having the United States in the Philippines," 
he said. "(But) I also sense that the political dynamic and environment are 
such that it's difficult to find elected leaders willing to stand up publicly 
and embrace continuation of the current arrangement." 
</P>
<P>
The United States provides Manila with about $500 million a year in military 
and economic aid in exchange for use of the bases, which are considered crucial 
to Washington's military strategy in the Pacific region. 
</P>
<P>
But Congress reduced the aid package by $96 million this year, enraging the 
Filipinos, who accused Washington of reneging on an earlier deal. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino snubbed Cheney when he visited Manila last week, saying she had no time 
to meet with him. And crowds of protesters burned him in effigy and chanted 
anti-American slogans during his meeting with Philippine Defense Minister Fidel 
V. Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney brushed aside Aquino's snub, saying that she remains greatly admired in 
the United States for helping lead the Philippines peacefully out of two 
decades of dictatorship under Ferdinand E. Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
He said that she privately sent a conciliatory message to him "through a third 
party" and that he considered the matter closed. 
</P>
<P>
On the Pacific tour, Cheney also visited South Korea and Japan, where he told 
officials that the United States plans to reduce its forces in the region by 
10,000 to 13,000 soldiers over the next three years. He asked Seoul and Tokyo 
to increase their share of the cost of supporting the remaining U.S. personnel.

A Cambodian government offensive spearheaded by Vietnamese troops, Soviet-built 
tanks and massive artillery overran 13 rebel bases and was headed for new 
targets Saturday, Thai and Cambodian resistance military sources said. 
</P>
<P>
In Phnom Penh, Cambodian Premier Hun Sen took a tough stand before the peace 
talks scheduled to start Monday in Jakarta, Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
He said his government will "maintain the status quo" until U.N.-supervised 
elections can be held to elect a new government. 
</P>
<P>
The three-faction Cambodian resistance, which includes the Khmer Rouge, 
reportedly captured a number of towns along the Thai border in recent weeks in 
its drive to overthrow the current government, installed by the Vietnamese over 
a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Thai military sources at the border town of Aranyaprathet said Vietnamese 
and Cambodian troops, led by about 20 Soviet-supplied tanks, have captured 12 
bases of the three-party resistance coalition as well as the key town of Svay 
Chek in the past four days of a major offensive.

BHAKTAPUR, Nepal 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jyoti Bagra Shakya had never thought much about democracy until last week. 
</P>
<P>
At 50, his entire life had been his grimy, one-room sweets shop. The poverty 
endemic to this remote Himalayan kingdom had largely isolated him from news of 
the extraordinary wave of democracy that has been sweeping much of the outside 
world. 
</P>
<P>
But then last Monday morning, the most distant ripples of this international 
wave touched his little town of Bhaktapur as a pro-democracy demonstration took 
place just down the street. Its force changed Shakya's life forever. 
</P>
<P>
His only son was shot and killed by the police. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I would like to die for this," Shakya, told a couple of visitors in the 
dingy fluorescence of his shop, his voice trembling with anger and despair. "I 
would like to put myself in front of the guns now and shout against this 
government." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Shakya and the thousands of other Nepalese who have grown increasingly 
disenchanted with three decades of sometimes-harsh monarchical rule will have 
their chance. 
</P>
<P>
Billed as "Black Sunday" by its organizers, a planned pro-democracy 
demonstration will be the latest in a series of anti-government protests that 
have left at least 10 dead and hundreds injured -- and the nation deeply 
concerned as it joins in the rising global clamor for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Nepal's pro-democracy movement -- they call it "The Stir" -- say 
they were inspired by the recent success of similar movements in Eastern 
Europe, an international wave that has finally reached "the top of the world" 
in the Himalayan country that is the site of the world's highest mountain, Mt. 
Everest. 
</P>
<P>
"The wave of democracy, which is sweeping the whole world, has encouraged the 
opposition forces in Nepal," Govinda Biyogi, president of the Nepal Journalists 
Assn. and a staunch supporter of The Stir, declared the other day. 
</P>
<P>
So far, though, the government's reaction to the movement has had less in 
common with that of most governments in Eastern Europe than with events in 
China, Nepal's ally and northern neighbor, where soldiers killed hundreds of 
people last spring in suppressing the pro-democracy demonstration in Beijing's 
Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in Monday's protest in Bhaktapur, the riot police quickly opened 
fire, killing at least four people, after the demonstrators began pelting them 
with stones. The police started firing even though, according to witnesses, 
they outnumbered the protesters by at least 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, nearly 1,000 Nepalese doctors and nurses staged an emotional sit-in 
and silent protest march alleging that police are using special fragmentation 
bullets that they said have caused maximum internal injury. 
</P>
<P>
Marching under a banner proclaiming "Medics Against Violations of Human 
Rights," the strikers also condemned the police for refusing to release the 
bodies of slain demonstrators to their families for cremation rites. The rites 
are sacred in Nepal, but police said they fear the corpses might be used as 
emotional catalysts in future rallies. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the crackdown began even before the protest movement got under way 
last Sunday in the capital, Katmandu, and other major cities. Government forces 
swept through the capital and arrested hundreds of dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
According to a government spokesman, 760 leaders and protesters are now in 
jail. But members of the opposition put the number of detainees in the 
thousands -- a charge supported by independent diplomats. Even the government 
concedes that its jails are so crowded that many prisoners are being held at a 
Katmandu granary. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than a dozen independent newspapers have been shut down, some 
by the government and others in protest after their owners refused to obey 
censorship orders. 
</P>
<P>
Now many Nepalese, among the world's friendliest and most engaging people, are 
afraid to talk to strangers. The few who do talk decline to give their names. 
</P>
<P>
"No one likes this government now," said one of the many guides who make their 
living in Nepal's booming tourist trade. "They're just killing too many people. 
And, more and more, the people are blaming it all on the king." 
</P>
<P>
But the campaign for democracy here is unlike any other in the world. What sets 
it apart are King Birendra, the Nepalese culture and the monarchical tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"Politics moves to a different rhythm here," one diplomat based in Katmandu 
said. "They're much less aggressive, much less violent. This is a society where 
the level of political consciousness has never been very high, due largely to 
the low literacy, rugged geography and superstitious traditions." 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders are not calling for the overthrow of the king, despite a 
widely held view that the king has ruled as a virtual autocrat and that his 
family is responsible for deep-seated official corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the opposition is appealing for the king's support in its bid to create 
a multi-party system and an elected legislature more independent than the 
rubber-stamp National Assembly created by King Birendra's father, Mahendra, 30 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, there is no one calling for the abolition of the monarchy," the 
diplomat said. "The role of the king is an all-important one, part of the 
uniqueness of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Nepal is the world's only officially Hindu nation, and many of its 17 million 
people still believe that their king is divine, an incarnation of one of many 
Hindu gods. He is venerated by many, respected by most and heeded by all. 
</P>
<P>
Yet many analysts are predicting that the king's popularity and power will wane 
if he fails to defuse the present crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the National Assembly are popularly elected from among a list of 
candidates largely handpicked by the monarchy. This system was adopted in 1960 
under King Mahendra after a decade of near-anarchy under a multi-party system. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of this panchayat system argue that it is a form of democracy best 
suited to Nepal, but the National Assembly has never challenged the king or his 
Cabinet ministers, not in enacting laws or in making policy. 
</P>
<P>
"This system cannot last forever," another diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the pro-democracy movement will ultimately bring about some 
kind of change. 
</P>
<P>
"The king will have to allow a National Assembly that is more representative of 
the people," this diplomat said, "rather than an executive body that does what 
it thinks will please the palace." 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and other analysts said the opposition has been strengthened by a 
recently formed alliance with old-guard, conservative politicians from the 
Nepalese Congress Party, which ran the multi-party National Assembly in the 
1950s, and the hard-line Communist parties, a mixture of Maoists and Marxists 
who have strong organizations in several areas. 
</P>
<P>
"The presence of the Communists in the pro-democracy cause makes this a strange 
movement," another diplomat observed. "The government loves to point out that 
this movement is being led by a discredited ideology." 
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the united opposition has managed to bring only students and old 
firebrand politicians into the streets. Most mainstream Nepalese have been 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
But there are indications that popular, grass-roots support is growing, 
especially after the shootings Monday in Bhaktapur. It is not clear, though, 
whether this support will translate into larger protests in a nation where the 
riot police inspire fear. 
</P>
<P>
The Nepalese, who are among the world's poorest people, are reeling from 
unprecedented inflation, the result of a yearlong trade dispute with Nepal's 
southern neighbor, India. Most analysts predict that continued 
government-sponsored bloodshed could easily turn the popular tide in favor of 
the demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot depends on the kind of police tactics that are used," one diplomat said. 
"In the Katmandu demonstrations last Sunday, they were pretty restrained. But 
Bhaktapur is an example of precisely what they cannot afford to have happen 
here this Sunday, which is seen as an acid test of the future of this 
movement." 
</P>
<P>
Bhaktapur was tailor-made for the confrontation. An ancient city of 
spectacular, wood-carved temples and palaces, it is deeply mired in poverty and 
has been a Communist stronghold for years. 
</P>
<P>
And its recent history is at least as brutal as the ancient Hindu battles 
described in Vedic texts. About a year and a half ago, a former Communist 
leader who had abandoned the party to join the National Assembly was seized by 
a mob while distributing earthquake relief to his supporters. The mob stripped 
him naked, poked his eyes out with an umbrella tip, castrated him and then beat 
him to death. 
</P>
<P>
It is this kind of violence that the government now fears, analysts said, and 
in the angry, desperate eyes of townspeople like Jyoti Bagra Shakya, even an 
outsider can detect such sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
Shakya has not been able to claim the body of his son, Nirmal, 24, despite 
several days of appealing to police officials and doctors at the hospital 
where, he has been told, the young man's remains lie on a mortuary slab. 
</P>
<P>
Every time he has tried, the police have refused. They reiterated their fear, 
he said, that he and the townspeople might use the body as the focus for 
another anti-government procession. 
</P>
<P>
Such fear seems well-founded. On Thursday, a crowd of several hundred 
protesters gathered outside the hospital to demand that the bodies of the 
victims of last Sunday's shooting be handed over.

DRIVE-IN CANCELS SCREENINGS AFTER BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fearing a repeat of a Friday night brawl that led to the wounding of an 
18-year-old suspected gang member, the manager of a Westminster drive-in 
theater Saturday canceled the weekend showings of a newly released movie that 
depicts Latino gang life in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not be playing it until further notice," said Joan Ruth, manager of 
the Hi-Way Drive-In. 
</P>
<P>
The showing of "Angel Town," the story of a former kick boxer who moves in with 
a Latino family living in the middle of a gang-infested neighborhood, was 
marred by a brawl that involved as many as 100 gang members. 
</P>
<P>
As the film was playing on the large outdoor screen, rival gang members 
wielding baseball bats began smashing car windows and fighting with each other, 
Lt. Robert Burnett said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred near the entrance of the drive-in and the violence 
spilled out to the street, police said. Jesus Martinez Orjel was wounded in the 
chest by a small-caliber handgun, Burnett said. Martinez was taken to UC Irvine 
Medical Center, where he was listed in stable condition.

JAMES FLANIGAN: FORD PAYING THE PRICE FOR EARLIER FAINTHEARTEDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald Petersen, who is taking early retirement as chairman of Ford Motor Co., 
told a friend recently that he feels he is leaving Ford in good shape, but that 
he is worried on one point: Ford -- and other U.S. car companies -- trail 
Japanese car makers in engine technology and will have to work hard to close 
the gap. 
</P>
<P>
Petersen is being clear-eyed on both counts. Ford is sound today, profitable 
and well financed, but it faces a challenge in engines. 
</P>
<P>
And the story behind that challenge -- and even Petersen's retirement at 63, 
say some analysts -- illustrates just how tough and daunting the global car 
business is these days. Also, at a time when Lee Iacocca, the outspoken 
chairman of Chrysler is touring the country decrying "a national inferiority 
complex," the Ford story offers a glimpse into the reasons behind that complex: 
Many Americans suspect that their best and brightest firms have lost the will 
to compete. 
</P>
<P>
Ford was the success of the 1980s, a venerable company that woke up to find 
itself facing the specter of bankruptcy in 1980 -- when it lost $1.5 billion -- 
but which recovered its old skills and finished the decade with profit and 
stature. Ford earned $3.8 billion last year on $96 billion in sales -- almost 
three times its sales in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Ford was the auto industry's style setter with the aerodynamic Taurus and 
similar cars, and it leads in more than style. The company rejiggered factories 
and labor relations in the 1980s and has become the low-cost producer among 
U.S. auto makers. "Some of Ford's plants are the equal of anything in Japan," 
says analyst Maryann Keller, of Furman Selz Mager Dietz &amp; Birney . Ford, in 
short, met the challenge of reducing manufacturing costs while bringing out 
eye-catching cars. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Petersen is right to worry. Because these days a company no sooner meets 
one challenge than another pops up. Ford will have to spend more than $3 
billion a year for the next five years on new engines that offer more power in 
smaller or lighter cars, and could lower fuel emissions in all cars. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese car makers are already proficient in such multivalve engines, and Ford 
acknowledges that that could be important. The engines will give car makers 
more flexibility in meeting the tougher fuel-efficiency and emissions standards 
anticipated in the '90s, explains John Huston, Ford's chief power-train 
engineer. That's why the company is pressing ahead and hopes to have a variety 
of such engines, along with advanced electronic transmissions, in its cars by 
the 1992 and '93 model years. 
</P>
<P>
The question arises: If the engines are important, why didn't Ford have them 
sooner? Did it lack technology? Or money? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is money -- but due more to a lack of confidence and unwillingness 
to invest than to a lack of dollars. The early 1980s brush with financial 
disaster frightened the Ford family, which controls 40% of the stock. So when 
the crisis passed and profits grew in the mid-1980s, Ford used some of them to 
buy into other businesses. Ford wanted an anchor against the uncertainties of 
the automotive industry, which included the prospect of a U.S. market crowded 
with foreign cars, both imported and U.S.-made. 
</P>
<P>
In financial services, Ford bought First Nationwide and other savings and loan 
companies, and later spent $3 billion to acquire the Associates, a commercial 
credit firm. "Detroit thinks of finance as secure," explains analyst Keller, 
"because even in poor years for car sales, the credit companies -- Ford Credit, 
GMAC, Chrysler Credit -- were always profitable." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond finance, the car companies veered into aerospace, seeking technology as 
well as supposedly steady military business. Ford bid on Hughes Aircraft, which 
General Motors eventually acquired, and considered buying Lockheed. Chrysler 
bought Gulfstream Aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
But caution has a price. Because they spent on diversification instead of 
engines, Ford lacks new products now, says analyst Arthur Davis of Prescott 
Ball &amp; Turben, and has to watch while competitors come out with new models. 
</P>
<P>
And the lack of new, powerful engines may also have hurt Ford's program to 
renovate its Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar cars. The renovated models 
initially were overweight and underpowered, say analysts, and that difficulty 
may have led to Chairman Petersen's early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
So, big consequences resulted from a spell of faintheartedness. However, it's 
not a permanent disability. Ford has lately reawakened to the competitive 
threat and is selling diversified subsidiaries -- Ford Aerospace and New 
Holland farm machinery -- to raise cash for the automobile business. It will 
push ahead with its own engine development and, meanwhile, procure engines for 
several of its cars from Japanese companies, including its joint venture 
partner Mazda. Ford remains one of the best and brightest U.S. companies, and a 
probable winner in the new decade as it was in the last. 
</P>
<P>
But Americans might ask themselves why it is that Japanese car makers are the 
ones with the engines. 
</P>
<P>
The answer, of course, is simple and obvious: They looked ahead, saw a need for 
lighter, yet powerful cars and invested in developing engines that would make 
such cars possible. They invested in their business, in other words. When U.S. 
companies get back to doing the same, competitiveness and American 
self-confidence will return.

DRIVER SHORTAGE SPURS COMPANY INCENTIVE PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The future of the trucking industry is riding on drivers like Michael Stewart. 
Drawn to trucking by the freedom that it offers, the young ex-roofer shrugs off 
its inconveniences: public restrooms, roadside meals, endless boredom. 
</P>
<P>
His family isn't so tolerant. Stewart, 28, gets home to Phoenix just twice a 
week, and his departures usually leave his 4-year-old son in tears. Last year, 
he missed his wife's birthday, his wedding anniversary and Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Teri, wants him to quit. "I'm tired of being mommy and daddy," she 
said. "I have to remind myself: This is what puts food on our table." 
</P>
<P>
The Stewart family's dilemma isn't new to trucking, an industry that each year 
loses 30% of its drivers to occupations offering higher pay and stable hours. 
But the family's problem has taken on new importance because of a driver 
shortage that has idled trucks and threatens to disrupt freight shipments. The 
industry figures that it will need 450,000 new drivers this year, 100,000 more 
than were hired in 1989, according to David Reed, a Hudson Institute researcher 
who has studied the problem. 
</P>
<P>
With so many jobs to fill, trucking executives are taking a more sympathetic 
view of drivers. Once regarded as easily replaced commodities, drivers 
increasingly are courted -- even pampered -- by employers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incentives 
</P>
<P>
To make drivers comfortable and happy, some firms have equipped chrome-laden 
trucks with soft seats and fancy electronic gadgets, such as stereos and 
cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies encourage drivers to take their wives on long hauls to make the 
trips more pleasant. One Arizona trucking company started a club for drivers' 
wives. 
</P>
<P>
One firm sends its dispatchers and fleet supervisors to sensitivity training 
sessions to learn how to talk nicely to drivers. Signs in some company 
terminals offer this reminder: "We dispatch people, not trucks." 
</P>
<P>
Growing numbers of trucking firms are starting recruitment departments and 
tuition-free schools to find and train prospective drivers. One company that 
has never advertised job openings now sends recruiters to truck stops and 
military bases to find driver candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart's employer, Swift Transportation, acted quickly when it learned of the 
family's trouble. The Phoenix-based company changed Stewart's schedule to get 
him home twice a week instead of only once every two weeks and invited his wife 
to join a company-sponsored support group for drivers' wives. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Moyes, owner of Swift, said his firm's success depends on the happiness 
of its drivers. "If we want drivers to stay in our industry, we better take 
care of them and treat them well." 
</P>
<P>
Moyes and other trucking executives acknowledge that this attitude is new. A 
decade ago, drivers were plentiful and easily replaced, thanks to a growing 
work force. Now, a national labor shortage gives even unskilled young adults a 
career choice, and few pick trucking. 
</P>
<P>
It is lonely work. A trip between Los Angeles and New York keeps a driver away 
from home for up to three weeks in a world defined by roadside motels, public 
restrooms and chicken-fried steak. It involves heavy labor; non-union drivers, 
who form the bulk of the industry's work force, often must load and unload 
their freight. 
</P>
<P>
The pay is low. Bernard Campbell, a trucking industry analyst with Data 
Resources, an economic research firm in Cambridge, Mass., said it is possible 
to earn as much as $40,000 a year as a truck driver, but only by working six 
days a week and spending long stretches of time on the road. Most drivers earn 
a lot less, he said, around $20,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
And it is a dead-end job. Very few drivers move from their trucks into such 
management positions as dispatcher or fleet supervisor. With no opportunity to 
move up, discouraged drivers move out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Frustrations 
</P>
<P>
Take Jim Erickson, a 34-year-old Minneapolis driver who spent four days 
recently at an Ontario, Calif., truck stop, waiting for his dispatcher to call 
with an assignment. 
</P>
<P>
The layover was, in his view, a metaphor for his career: a big waste of time. 
"I've kind of had it," said Erickson, who sees no future in trucking. He plans 
to quit to take a job as a carpenter that offers steady hours and the 
possibility of becoming his own boss. 
</P>
<P>
The driver shortage has so far affected only a scattered number of trucking 
companies, but a severe shortage of drivers could tie industrial America in 
knots. Without enough drivers, truck shipments to factories and stores would 
arrive late, slowing production and causing shortages. 
</P>
<P>
The driver shortage is worst in the Northeast, where cold weather and congested 
roads make it unpleasant to drive a truck. But many trucking executives 
throughout the country -- even in Sun Belt states -- say they are short-handed. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona trucking executive Gus Osterkamp says that at least 12 of Osterkamp 
Trucking's 250 trucks are idle each day because he can't find anyone to drive 
them. Teamsters Union official Alex Ybarrolaza says the situation is tight in 
Northern California, where he estimates that 10,000 jobs are unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
The shortage caused Teresi Trucking of Lodi to scrap plans for a new terminal 
in Tulare. "We decided it would be a big mistake to open a terminal, buy six or 
eight trucks and not have drivers for them," said Teresi executive Ferrell 
Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
The driver shortage is expected to worsen as tough new federal drug-testing and 
licensing laws force drivers off the road. Many drivers are expected to flunk 
drug tests mandated under a law that went into effect last month. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to see a lot of fallout from the tests," said Conway Western 
executive Bob Diaz, who predicted that trucking firms will lose business, at 
least temporarily, as drug-using drivers are taken off the road. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz speaks from experience. When Conway Western, based in Santa Fe Springs, 
started testing its drivers for drug use three years ago, half failed. That 
rate has since dropped to 10%, thanks to a companywide anti-drug campaign and 
screening of job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
New licensing tests are also sidelining drivers. Last year, California became 
the first state to comply with a federal law that requires the tougher tests, 
and 35% of the drivers failed. 
</P>
<P>
The tests are intended to get unqualified drivers off the road and help reduce 
a truck accident rate that has climbed 40% nationwide since 1982. California 
truck drivers now take detailed written tests and 90-minute road tests before 
getting licenses. By 1992, every state must have license tests similar to 
California's. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Roadblocks 
</P>
<P>
Trucking firms face other legal roadblocks in their search for drivers. 
Recruitment efforts are handicapped by federal laws requiring that interstate 
drivers read English and be at least 21 years old. Those rules eliminate a vast 
pool of job-seeking immigrants and high-school dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
Few job applicants meet legal and company job requirements, which sometimes 
include passing psychological tests. Osterkamp, the Pomona trucking executive, 
said that out of 100 recent job applicants, only 10 were qualified and only 
three took a job with his company. 
</P>
<P>
Osterkamp's firm is too small to launch an all-out effort to find and train 
drivers, but his larger competitors have done so. 
</P>
<P>
Trucking magazines are loaded with ads that promise recruits decent pay, new 
trucks and frequent trips home. A number of nationwide firms display ads for 
drivers on company trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Swift Transportation tripled the size of its recruitment department last year, 
and another firm, J. B. Hunt Transport Services of Lowell, Ark., doubled its 
hiring force. 
</P>
<P>
J. B. Hunt posts a recruiter at each of its terminals, including one in South 
Gate. The recruiters visit truck stops and military bases in search of 
prospects. The company sends its recruits to a 12-week driver course at its 
headquarters and houses the trainees in company-leased apartments. It's all 
free, and graduates are promised a job. 
</P>
<P>
Other trucking companies have taken similar steps. 
</P>
<P>
Conway Western, a non-union unit of Consolidated Freightways, gets 80% of its 
new drivers from its schools in Santa Fe Springs, Oakland and Phoenix. 
Potential drivers -- among them former-teachers, store clerks and warehouse 
workers -- attend the tuition-free school while receiving pay from the company 
for work on the loading docks. After a 10-week course that includes lessons on 
safety and hazardous wastes, students take a 57-mile road test on Los 
Angeles-area freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Without the schools, Conway Western would be understaffed, according to George 
C. Reid, the firm's president. "Our ability to grow would be severely 
constrained." 
</P>
<P>
But trucking executives say schools are only part of the solution. 
</P>
<P>
A discouraging number of the graduates quit. Moyes, the owner of Swift 
Transportation, said 35% of his school's graduates quit after a year and go on 
to different firms or to new occupations. Other trucking companies also report 
disappointing retention rates. 
</P>
<P>
Swift and other trucking firms try to keep drivers by making the job more 
appealing. Bakersfield trucking executive Don H. Freymiller put high-quality 
stereo speakers, cassette players and television sets in Freymiller Trucking's 
625 vehicles to make long trips more tolerable. The trucks' extended cabs are 
also equipped with cots. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a motel room but it's comfortable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flexible Schedules 
</P>
<P>
Freymiller also installed comfortable passenger seats in his trucks and 
encourages drivers to take their wives on long trips. He said the amenities 
offered by his company are an important reason he has no trouble finding 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to make drivers happy, some companies are trying to reduce the 
number of days drivers are away from home. 
</P>
<P>
Conway Western, from example, recently paid $2 million for 40 acres in 
Kettleman City, halfway between Los Angeles and Oakland on Interstate 5. The 
company plans to build a "turn station" there, where northbound drivers will 
trade loads with southbound drivers. This means that drivers who once made the 
two-day round trip between Los Angeles and Oakland would make a one-day round 
trip between Los Angeles and Kettleman City. "Our goal," a company executive 
said, "is to get our drivers home every night." 
</P>
<P>
Not every trucking company can do that. Swift Transportation drivers make 
deliveries in 12 Western states, and its drivers get home three times a week at 
best. In an effort to ease the strain on his drivers' families, Moyes five 
months ago started a club for drivers' wives. 
</P>
<P>
"This way, if a wife has a problem, she knows another wife with a husband who 
works for the company," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 65 wives who have joined the club put together a phone list so they can 
contact each other for support. 
</P>
<P>
The wives try to get the children involved too. The highlight of last year's 
Christmas party was a tour of a big rig so children could see what their 
fathers drive. 
</P>
<P>
Teri Stewart said the club has made her role as a driver's wife tolerable, and 
she is trying not to pressure her husband to make a career switch -- for now. 
"You see other women who deal with the strain," she said. "It makes it easier." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN TRUCK DRIVERS 
</P>
<P>
* The "typical" truck driver is a white male, married and over 40. 
</P>
<P>
* Women account for only 2% of the nation's 2 million drivers. Among male 
drivers, 79% are white, 13% are black and 6% are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
* The average weekly earnings in 1989 for drivers of heavy trucks were $416. 
That compares to average weekly wages of $399 for all full-time employed 
workers. 
</P>
<P>

THAT BUILD LARGE TRUCKS, ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE LITTLE TO FEAR SO FAR FROM JAPANESE 
COMPETITION, ARE STRUGGLING WITH GROWING LOSSES.;

Sterling Transit, a longtime California trucking firm, had an enviable safety 
record -- the company won a safe-driving award from the California Trucking 
Assn. last year -- but it wasn't enough to steer it away from disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, the 57-year-old Montebello trucking company slammed into a 
mountain of debt and closed its doors, one of 1,000 trucking firms nationwide 
to do so last year. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years after the federal government lifted most of its restrictions on 
interstate trucking, the industry is still in turmoil. Intense competition 
among trucking companies has led to vicious rate wars that have weakened some 
firms and wiped out thousands of others. 
</P>
<P>
Besides fighting it out among themselves, a large number of trucking companies 
face increased competition from railroad intermodal networks. With special flat 
cars, railroads transport container cargo inland after it arrives on ships from 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, virtually all container cargo was shipped by truck. But now, 
said Bernard Campbell, a transportation analyst with the consulting firm Data 
Resources in Cambridge, Mass., "the railroads have gotten their acts together. 
In many cases, they are just as quick and cost-efficient as trucks." 
</P>
<P>
Trucking executives said in interviews that when the lengthy, post-deregulation 
shakeout is finally over, only two kinds of companies -- nimble local firms and 
national giants -- will remain. These executives said continued rate wars will 
drive regional firms -- such as Sterling Transit -- out of business, or into 
the arms of larger, acquisition-minded competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Lundberg, owner of Sterling Transit, said deregulation helped kill off 
his firm. Lower-cost, non-union trucking companies were able to attract his 
regular customers with lower rates. Last year, Sterling lost 10 accounts worth 
a total of $300,000 a month -- one-quarter of its monthly revenue. "We simply 
couldn't compete," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies have disappeared through mergers. In California, one of the 
strongest regional carriers, Viking Transit of San Jose, was gobbled up in 1988 
by Roadway, one of the nation's top three trucking companies. More recently, 
Los Angeles-based Transcon agreed to buy Coastal Corp.'s money-losing ANR 
Freight Systems in a deal that would create the country's fourth-largest 
trucking firm. (The acquisition is being contested in federal court, however, 
by an Illinois investment firm that claims Coastal had agreed to sell ANR 
Freight to it.) 
</P>
<P>
Deregulation has not been a disaster for all trucking firms. Given the freedom 
to operate anywhere in the country and to set rates, a number of companies have 
grown and prospered. The big firms, such as Consolidated Freightways, Roadway 
and Yellow Freight, have especially benefited from deregulation because they 
have the financial wherewithal to withstand rate competition and the size to 
compete in many markets. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller firms have grown in a deregulated marketplace by carefully selecting 
their market and watching costs. Donald Freymiller, owner of a Bakersfield firm 
that transports refrigerated freight, said deregulation has allowed his company 
to grow from 95 trucks in 1980 to 625 today. "Those who cry foul haven't 
learned how to curtail costs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated Freightways, based in Palo Alto, has probably pursued the most 
aggressive expansion plan since deregulation. It has broadly diversified from 
basic long-haul service into regional trucking, ocean shipment and air freight, 
evolving from simply a trucking concern into a well-rounded transportation 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated's February, 1989, acquisition of Emery Air Freight, for example, 
is an integral part of the company's plan to expand in Europe. Consolidated 
President and Chief Executive Lary R. Scott envisions a network that would fly 
goods from the United States to Europe on Emery, then deliver them on 
Consolidated's trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Other large trucking companies have taken a more conservative approach. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow Freight, the nation's largest trucker, has no intention of straying from 
its specialty, long-haul trucking. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Burdick, Yellow Freight's marketing vice president, said part of the reason 
that Yellow, headquartered in Overland Park, Kan., has not diversified is that 
it was not prepared when deregulation occurred. Unlike its chief rivals, 
Consolidated and Roadway, it lacked a terminal and communications network and 
needed to play catch-up to compete with them. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to emphasize our core business" and, unlike Consolidated, "we 
will not set up regional companies," Burdick said. "Each company is pursuing 
its own strategy and, in time, the stockholders will decide which was the 
correct course of action." 
</P>
<P>
Transcon, Consolidated Freightways and Yellow Freight are among the firms that 
focus on delivery of small shipments for a variety of customers. Known in the 
industry as less-than-truckload carriers, these firms collect shipments from 
customers and distribute them from a central terminal in much the same way that 
United Parcel Service gathers and delivers packages. 
</P>
<P>
The less-than-truckload business is generally in better financial shape than 
the rest of the trucking industry, primarily because fewer companies focus on 
it. One reason is cost. The ability to efficiently juggle many deliveries for 
many customers requires investment in sophisticated computer equipment. Often, 
the less-than-truckload carriers supply their customers with computer terminals 
so they can track their shipments themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The costly equipment is essential, trucking executives say. "If we didn't have 
it, we wouldn't be in business right now," said Scott of Consolidated 
Freightways. 
</P>
<P>
However, the less-than-truckload business is not immune from the rate wars that 
have bothered the rest of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The rate wars are a direct result of government deregulation, which gave 
shippers the right to negotiate rates. Deregulation also opened the door to 
many new trucking firms, creating an increase in capacity and more rate 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Trucking firms routinely bargain rates down to capture business, at the expense 
of profits. Last year, a 4.7% rate increase announced in April by 
less-than-truckload shippers was discounted away by late fall. 
</P>
<P>
In some markets, trucking firms charge special weekend rates that are nearly 
half the regular rate to keep trucks from sitting idle when business is slow. 
</P>
<P>
This year, trucking firms have raised rates 5% to 7%, in part to cover fuel 
costs. But trucking executives say they are not sure that the increase will 
remain in force, especially if the economy slows. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned," Scott said. "Our profits are not what they should be. 
Something has to happen to stop the rate erosion." 
</P>
<P>
The pressure on profits has led trucking firms to trim costs where possible. 
Freymiller Trucking of Bakersfield replaces its fleet every two years to keep 
fuel and maintenance costs low. The fuel efficiency of its fleet has doubled 
since 1980, owner Donald Freymiller said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said his liability insurance rate has fallen sharply since 1985, when 
he started testing his drivers and job applicants for drug use. (Federal law 
requires all trucking firms to test employees for drug use beginning this year, 
although the start of those tests has been delayed by legal challenges.) 
</P>
<P>
Many trucking firms have taken aim at labor costs, which normally account for 
about 47% of a company's operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
A growing number of trucking firms are giving employees a stake in their future 
through employee stock ownership plans or profit-sharing programs, in return 
for wage concessions. But those solutions don't work if the company isn't 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling owner Lundberg said his company's 180 drivers took a 13% wage cut two 
years ago in return for an ownership stake, but it wasn't enough to keep the 
company going. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated Freightways took an unusual approach to lowering its labor costs. 
Rather than expand its network by selectively buying regional firms, it started 
new companies from scratch -- but with non-union labor. 
</P>
<P>
Employees of these regional companies, which are called Conway and specialize 
in overnight delivery, earn nearly as much and have many of the same fringe 
benefits as Consolidated Freight-ways' long-haul drivers, Scott said. But the 
Conway drivers aren't restricted by union work rules that limit their tasks. 
For example, the non-union drivers also load and unload freight. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, Consolidated Freightways' tactic hasn't ruffled the Teamsters 
Union, which represents most union drivers but hasn't tried to organize Conway. 
California Teamsters official Alex Ybarolaza said he understands Consolidated's 
strategy and that it seems successful. But in general, he said, non-union 
workers earn less and have fewer benefits than union workers. 
</P>
<P>
Deregulation has led to some unusual alliances. Two months ago, J. B. Hunt 
Transport Services, a full-truckload company, joined forces with its 
traditional rival, Santa Fe Railway, to form a door-to-door delivery service 
for business customers. Rather than compete with the railroad along the Los 
Angeles-to-Chicago route, J. B. Hunt will pick up and deliver freight 
transported between those two cities by rail. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, the trucking industry analyst, said he expects other truckers to seek 
similar deals. "It's hard for truckers to attract drivers to these long-haul 
markets, and the competition is cutthroat. Why not back away a little bit and 
form a venture where they can have a better chance of making money?" 
</P>
<P>
As the scores of trucking failures testify, not every company is doing well. 
Even large companies, burdened by high labor costs and a lack of modern 
equipment, have trouble. For example, many trucking industry analysts question 
the proposed merger of Transcon and ANR, two money-losing companies. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Transcon say they think that they can consolidate the two 
companies' distribution networks, cut the fat and make money. But industry 
watchers wonder whether Transcon can actually pull off the financial alchemy 
and turn the red ink into black. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be very difficult to put the two companies together," said 
George G. Morris, an analyst with Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben, an investment 
firm in Cleveland. Morris described Transcon as having been in "financial free 
fall" before the merger. 
</P>
<P>
"If we go through another recessionary period, it will very difficult," he 
said. "I guess only time will tell."

IRVINE FIRM SEEKS IMPRINT ON COPIER INDUSTRY; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: GRADCO SUPPLIES COPY MACHINE ACCESSORIES TO MAJOR JAPANESE 
MANUFACTURERS. YET ANALYSTS SAY IT HAS NOT LIVED UP TO ITS POTENTIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keith B. Stewart, an articulate man with a graying beard and a stern demeanor, 
has built a company that looks on the surface like a classic entrepreneurial 
success. In little more than 10 years, his Irvine-based Gradco Systems Inc. has 
grown from a lowly distributor of mechanical paper feeders to a $100-million 
company that claims a virtual monopoly on certain copy machine accessories. 
</P>
<P>
And with the growing proliferation of copiers, computer printers and fax 
machines, a company specializing in paper sorters and feeders would seem to 
have a great future, especially when it can boast, as Gradco does, of broad 
patents and strong relationships with major Japanese electronics companies. 
</P>
<P>
But Gradco has never quite lived up to Wall Street's expectations. Stock was 
initially offered to the public in 1983 at $18 a share, and it now languishes 
around $9. A proposed management-led buyout announced by Stewart last fall -- 
which drove the stock to $19 -- never materialized, apparently because the 
Japanese financiers who were backing the deal grew skittish. And last month, 
Gradco announced an unexpected quarterly loss and a sharp decline in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
While Stewart maintains that these setbacks are temporary, others are not so 
sure. Gradco recently lost a key contract to supply sorters to Xerox Corp., and 
analysts suggest that other copier companies may find ways to design around 
Gradco's patents. Analysts have also raised questions about Stewart's 
management style, and both Gradco and Stewart are facing several unrelated 
lawsuits alleging various forms of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, a controversial figure described by associates as everything from an 
"excellent manager" to "autocratic, charming and ruthless," says the lawsuits 
are all groundless. And he maintains that the poor quarterly results were an 
aberration that will be emphatically corrected in the coming year. "Demand for 
our products is greater than ever," Stewart said in an interview. "We have 
contracts with every major copier manufacturer going forward." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some securities analysts still believe that Gradco has a lot of 
potential. A recent report from the Los Angeles brokerage firm Bateman Eichler, 
Hill Richards states that the company has a "bright long-term future" and 
predicts that either a buyout or simply good operating performance will drive 
the stock at least to the $12 level and possibly much higher. New York-based 
Plenum Publishing Corp. now owns about 8% of Gradco's shares and has said it 
might pursue a takeover, though most analysts discount that possibility and say 
a Japanese takeover is more likely. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart has taken the offensive in countering the recent troubles and is 
putting the finishing touches on a complex restructuring of Gradco that will 
shift the core operations to Japan. A management buyout, he said, still remains 
a possibility, as does a takeover by another firm or a public offering of the 
beefed-up Japanese subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restructuring 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring plan calls for Gradco's Japanese subsidiary to assume 
operational responsibility for all copier products, which account for some 70% 
of Gradco's revenue and include the patented "moving bin" sorter that has long 
been the core of Gradco's business. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining operating entity in the United States will be called Gradco 
Printer Products and will be headed by a new president currently being 
recruited from outside the company. Gradco Systems in Irvine will effectively 
become a holding company for the operating entities, carrying out some basic 
research and development as well as corporate finance and acquisition 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese unit will be headed by Mark Takeuchi, whose track record includes 
a long stint at C. Itoh &amp; Co., and Gradco Japan will establish its own 
subsidiary in the United States under the name Gradco Systems America. Ikegami 
Tsushinki Ltd. of Japan and Sindo-Ricoh &amp; Co. of South Korea will take 
small equity stakes in the Japanese company and will be responsible for all 
engineering and manufacturing of Gradco's copier and printer products, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The equity stakes, whose exact proportions have not been determined, constitute 
a "pre-distribution" of shares that would speed up any future public offering 
of the Japanese subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said equity or joint venture partners will also be sought for the 
U.S.-based printer business, and a new distribution network for those products 
will either be developed internally or acquired. The fate of Gradco's 
100-employee Santa Ana manufacturing facility has not been determined, but it 
might be closed. 
</P>
<P>
"On the surface, the printer and copier markets look very much the same," 
Stewart said in explaining the reorganization. "But the more you look at them, 
they are totally different markets with products sold through entirely 
different channels, and they take different sets of skills and experience." The 
new manufacturing arrangements will yield substantial cost reductions, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart hopes that the new structure will enable Gradco to build the 
printer-products side of the business to 50% of revenue and reduce the 
company's heavy dependence on copying machine sorters. The moving-bin sorter, 
which consists of a column of as many as 20 paper bins that move up and down to 
catch the copies as they emerge from the machine, is the technology of choice 
for small office copiers known as "convenience copiers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contract Loss 
</P>
<P>
Gradco has attributed its recent problems -- a quarterly loss of $1.5 million 
on revenue of $20.5 million, contrasted with a profit of $1.4 million and 
revenue of $30.4 million a year ago -- to the loss of a major contract, product 
delays on the part of the copier manufacturers and problems in getting some of 
its printer products out the door. Stewart confirmed that the lost contract was 
with Xerox Corp., one of the company's oldest and biggest customers. 
</P>
<P>
Xerox still does business with Gradco, and Stewart notes that Fuji Xerox of 
Japan remains a major customer. But the fact that Xerox is increasingly using 
its own sorter technology points to a potentially broader problem for Gradco. 
Much of Wall Street's enthusiasm for the stock over the past five years grew 
out of the perception that Gradco had a virtual monopoly in its niche, and that 
is becoming less and less the case. 
</P>
<P>
"There are ways to get around the patents," said Robert Sostilio, who follows 
copiers for the market research firm Dataquest. If copier manufacturers can 
develop their own technology, they can make their own sorters and not rely on 
products or licenses from Gradco. Nicholas Pantazis, an analyst with the New 
York stock research firm Monness Crespi &amp; Hardt, added: "Gradco has had the 
most effective technology, but not the only technology." 
</P>
<P>
A former Gradco executive, who asked not to be identified, said the company had 
done "a very poor job of taking advantage of its place in the market," 
remaining far too dependent on moving-bin sorters. Gradco's effort to penetrate 
the printer-feeder business through the acquisition of Ziyad Inc. in 1986 for 
$24.5 million has had mixed results, and Gradco's newest market -- sorters for 
fax machines that would route incoming documents to personalized mailboxes -- 
is unlikely to develop for some years. 
</P>
<P>
The dent in Gradco's image that became visible last year was especially 
ill-timed for the firm, coming just as Stewart was trying to put together a 
management buyout. After a run-up in the stock price, Stewart disclosed last 
September that he was pursuing a buyout and had retained the Lodestar Group as 
financial advisers. But on Dec. 1, after several days of rumors, Stewart 
revealed that the financing had fallen through. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said Ysuda Trust Co. and Yamaichi Securities were both part of the 
proposed buyout, though he would not confirm reports that the buyout consisted 
of a novel plan to take the company private and then re-float it on the 
Japanese stock exchange. This would have enabled Gradco to take advantage of 
the fact that share prices in Japan are far higher for the same level of 
earnings than they are in the United States, and it made sense for the company 
because so many of its major customers are in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The Gradco deal was still being put together when the failure of the United 
Airlines leveraged buyout cast a pall over all such transactions, Stewart said, 
though he conceded that the earnings problems also may have contributed to the 
collapse of the deal. Stewart owns 12% of Gradco's shares and indirectly 
controls another 11%. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Gilday of Gruntal &amp; Co. in New York and several other analysts said 
the buyout discussions diverted the attention of Stewart and other Gradco 
executives from the day-to-day operations of the business, contributing to the 
poor results. Stewart rejects the criticism. "It's just not that time-consuming 
a process," he said, and added that the bad results were due to factors beyond 
his -- or anyone else's -- control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Upside Potential 
</P>
<P>
Some outside observers agree that Gradco's difficulties are nothing out of the 
ordinary. Elliot Steinberg, a San Francisco investment manager who helped 
advise the wealthy Pritzker family when it bought a 6% stake in Gradco, said 
the problems were similar to those experienced by many small companies. 
"They've just fallen behind in their game plan," Steinberg said. "But they 
should make up for it this year." 
</P>
<P>
Frank K. Moore, a former Gradco director who owns an Orange County copier 
outlet, said he believes that the company has scraped bottom and "the upside 
potential is excellent." Gradco, he said, has "gone through some struggles," 
but is now in "better shape than ever." 
</P>
<P>
One securities analyst criticized the investment community for not looking more 
closely at the company and building up expectations that could not be met. 
Stewart echoed this notion, saying there had been a lot of speculation over the 
past several years. He attributed the financial community's interest to the 
fact that his was a niche company with a strong market position whose business 
was easy to understand. But while the former price of $19 a share might have 
been based on takeover speculation, at $9 the stock is undervalued, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some Gradco watchers remain wary of the company, in part because 
of Stewart himself. A native of the United Kingdom who was raised in Rhodesia, 
Stewart -- who lives in Laguna Beach and drives a Rolls Royce with "GRADCO" 
license plates -- tends to evoke strong reactions from those who come in 
contact with him. While many associates praise him as a dynamic businessman 
with a tremendous amount of energy and excellent sales skills, others say he is 
autocratic, unable to delegate authority and disrespectful of those who 
disagree with him. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Shea, who co-founded Gradco with Stewart as a simple collater distributor 
in 1972, describes Stewart as an excellent salesman who can be very charming 
but also can be quite ruthless. Shea, now the owner of Entrepreneur magazine, 
said he and Stewart no longer talk.

Analysts question Stewart's management style. "It's definitely a one-man show," 
said Donna Hostetler, an analyst with Crowell Weedon &amp; Co. in Los Angeles. 
"Whatever Stewart wants, he'll get. I don't think the company is run by the 
board of directors. When a company gets to a certain size, you have to start 
delegating, and I don't think he's done that." 
</P>
<P>
Gilday of Gruntal &amp; Co., a one-time touter of Gradco stock when she was 
with McKinley Allsopp, added: "Steps have been taken that have failed, and the 
business has dropped off, so I don't give him high marks." 
</P>
<P>
But Moore called Stewart "dynamic, intelligent and very creative in the way he 
does business," though he said Stewart had in the past made some mistakes in 
choosing managerial talent. "He has given up the reins and it hasn't worked 
out; he's had to step back in." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawsuits Filed 
</P>
<P>
Two former employees have much harsher criticism for Stewart. In separate but 
related lawsuits filed in Connecticut, John C. Hamma and R. Clark Dubois, both 
former Gradco engineers, allege that they were co-inventors of the sorter 
technology and that Stewart fraudulently deprived them of royalty payments. 
</P>
<P>
They charge that Stewart induced them to accept lump-sum payments in lieu of a 
percentage of sales by misrepresenting the status of Gradco's efforts to 
license the technology to major copier manufacturers. Hamma also alleges that 
he was intimidated by Stewart and threatened with termination if he hired a 
lawyer, and Dubois claims that he was fired and locked out of his office for 
complaining. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said the claims are completely without merit. Gradco's key technology, 
he said, was invented by Frederick J. Lawrence, who remains the company's chief 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart also has been sued for $6 million by Alton Laguna Partners, owner of 
Gradco's headquarters in the Irvine Spectrum. Alton Laguna alleges that Gradco 
backed out of a deal for an expansion of the office space after the partnership 
refused to enter a "usurious" loan agreement with an off-shore company 
affiliated with Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart called the allegations "fictitious" and "a joke," and said he had 
refused a recent offer to settle the case out of court. Robert Beauchamp, an 
attorney representing Alton Laguna, said his client offered to settle for $3 
million. "We are not concerned about the strength of our case; we think it's 
very strong," Beauchamp said. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the failed management buyout, Gradco also has been sued by 
several shareholders claiming breach of fiduciary duties. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart has in the past suffered reversals in the courtroom. In 1986, an Orange 
County Superior Court judge ruled that Stewart had fraudulently persuaded his 
wife to accept a $750,000 divorce settlement in 1983 by concealing from her the 
true value of Gradco. Under the settlement, Connie Stewart agreed to give up 
any claim to 2.1 million Gradco shares that the Stewarts owned. A day after the 
agreement was signed, Gradco sent a letter to shareholders announcing its plans 
for a public stock offering, which eventually valued those shares at more than 
$37 million. 
</P>
<P>
The case was subsequently settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how many feathers he has ruffled, though, Stewart can still lay claim 
to building a successful company that competes in a part of industry where few 
American companies dare tread. Standing in the lobby of Gradco's headquarters, 
Stewart gestures brusquely at row of plaques on the wall -- quality awards from 
International Business Machines and several other companies. "Why does everyone 
look at the negative and never talk about that?" he grumbles. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if Stewart's latest plan succeeds, Wall Street may again be talking 
about Gradco as a great American entrepreneurial success.

Confederation officials were quoted Saturday by the newspaper El Universal as 
saying the government has failed to respond to accusations that it authorized 
the shipment of 1,150 pounds of turtle shells to Japan in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The shells are widely use for making expensive combs, key rings, eyeglass

PLAN TO COVER RESERVOIRS DRAWS 1,000 L.A. PROTESTERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 angry and vocal Los Angeles residents clashed with city Department 
of Water and Power officials Saturday over a controversial proposal to cover 
six of the city's open-air reservoirs as part of a water-purification effort. 
</P>
<P>
For two hours, residents held aloft critical signs, jeered, hissed and bellowed 
catcalls at DWP officials as they tried to present a slide show outlining the 
options under consideration in the purification effort. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP is formulating its plan in response to more-stringent drinking water 
standards it expects from the state and federal government, and says it could 
cost taxpayers as much as $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held at Le Conte Junior High School in Hollywood, was the seventh 
of nine forums the DWP has scheduled for this month to solicit public comment 
before completing its plan to improve the quality of drinking water for 3.4 
million city residents. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Mahler, representing the Coalition to Preserve Open Reservoirs, told the 
gathering that the DWP had its priorities wrong. At the same time the DWP 
considers covering reservoirs that pose no safety risk, he said, it virtually 
ignores severe ground-water contamination problems that have forced a shutdown 
of drinking water wells in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"In short, the open reservoir water-quality improvement project is an 
expensive, environmentally destructive, billion-dollar Band-Aid that the DWP is 
trying to plaster over serious problems within our entire water system," Mahler 
said. "Trying to shove the project down our throats will do nothing to restore 
the confidence of citizens. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Mahler got a standing ovation from the crowd, as did other several speakers. 
</P>
<P>
The catcalls got so bad that at one point an onlooker rose to condemn what he 
called "utterly contemptible public displays," adding that although he did not 
approve of covering the reservoirs, "I'm a taxpayer, and we don't owe you 
people a pretty reservoir just so you can look at it." 
</P>
<P>
Coalition spokeswoman Susan Scibilia said the public turnout was the best yet, 
adding that each successive meeting has drawn increasing numbers of concerned 
citizens from across the city -- not just from areas near reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP has proposed covering Upper Stone Canyon, Santa Ynez, Upper Hollywood, 
Ivanhoe, Elysian and Rowena reservoirs, which range in size from 5.7 acres to 
14.6 acres. Options for the remaining reservoirs considered too large and 
irregularly shaped to be covered -- Lower Hollywood, Silver Lake, Encino and 
Lower Stone Canyon -- include fitting them with filtration systems or replacing 
them with storage tanks. 
</P>
<P>
"Today the water delivered to you is good, but it could be better," DWP 
engineer Tom Rulla said during his slide presentation. "There are real threats 
from water taken from open reservoirs." 
</P>
<P>
Rulla and Walter Hoye, engineer of water design for DWP, said bird droppings 
and particles from the air and water runoff are contaminating the open 
reservoirs. They also said sunlight is creating algae that fosters potentially 
carcinogenic compounds when mixed with chlorine. The reservoirs are outdated, 
DWP officials said, and help contribute to the fact that two out of three DWP 
customers no longer drink tap water. 
</P>
<P>
"Our customers have concerns . . . and we want to address those concerns and be 
responsive to our customers," Hoye said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rancorous tone of many in the crowd, Hoye remarked: "This is a good 
turnout. We are very pleased about that." 
</P>
<P>
The remaining two meetings are set for later this month in Eagle Rock and 
Canoga Park. A final environmental impact report, including the public 
comments, is expected by November, after which it will be considered for 
approval by DWP commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
Water used by Los Angeles residents, most of which is transported from hundreds 
of miles away, is held in 96 reservoirs and tanks around the Los Angeles Basin. 
The DWP says most of the reservoirs already are covered.

Two elderly women were killed Saturday when a car struck them as they were 
walking on a sidewalk on the 2500 block of West Broadway, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car, Denise Arlene Perreira, 22, Anaheim, was arrested on 
suspicion of manslaughter and driving under the influence of drugs, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the victims was pronounced dead at the scene.

The other died at Humana Hospital-West Anaheim, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the victims were not released pending notification of their 
families.

Police said Perreira was driving east on Broadway about noon when her car 
veered across the street, struck the two women on the sidewalk, then crashed 
into a tree. 
</P>
<P>
Perreira was taken to Anaheim Memorial Hospital for injuries she received in 
the accident.

OIL SPILL: TASK FORCE SAYS CLEANUP COULD TAKE ANOTHER WEEK. PUBLIC-PRIVATE TASK 
FORCE SETS TOUGH NEW STANDARDS THAT MUST BE MET BEFORE THE PUBLIC IS ALLOWED

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A task force of public and private officials said Saturday that it may take at 
least another week before beaches closed by the Feb. 7 oil spill can be 
reopened. 
</P>
<P>
Although the task force reached agreement on what level of oil and other 
hydrocarbons found on the beaches will allow their reopening, officials said 
that water and ground testing probably will not begin until March 7, when the 
cleanup effort is expected to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
Under new guidelines set by the task force, average concentrations of less than 
100 parts per million total hydrocarbons taken from ground and water sampling 
must be met before officials will allow the beaches to reopen, said Huntington 
Beach Fire Battalion Chief Dennis Groat. 
</P>
<P>
Officials agreed on those guidelines at a meeting of the interagency Post 
Clean-up and Health Risk Evaluation Committee, composed of representatives from 
city, county, and state agencies and British Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
"Once tests are conducted, we should know the results within 24 to 30 hours," 
Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines are based on a standard set by the Orange County health 
department, which allows hydrocarbons in a concentration of 100 parts per 
million in residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Webster, a spokesman for British Petroleum, the owner of the spilled oil, 
said company environmental officers who attended Saturday's meeting agreed to 
the new guidelines, "which seemed reasonable, given the potential health risk 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have arrived upon a system that will allow that type of testing to 
move forward. We were a part of the process from the beginning," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup costs for British Petroleum have increased to $13 million as a result 
of the 394,000-gallon spill from the ruptured tanker American Trader, Webster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About a 10-mile stretch of shoreline from Bolsa Chica State Beach to the 
Newport Pier still remains closed, frustrating many beach-goers. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Moreland, 18, of Orange and his brother, Ron, 22, said they woke up 
Saturday, looked outside at the sunny day and immediately headed for Huntington 
Beach, forgetting about the spill. 
</P>
<P>
After being turned away, as were others, Brent muttered: "Tell them to hurry up 
and fix the oil spill. I can't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, all city and state beach parking lots will be closed. The 
bike path, however, will be open from Warner Avenue near Bolsa Chica to Beach 
boulevards. But the path will remain closed from Beach Boulevard to the Santa 
Ana River jetties. 
</P>
<P>
In Newport Beach, the pedestrian boardwalk will be open, but the beach side of 
the walkway will be cordoned off to prevent anyone from going onto the sand. 
</P>
<P>
Ground and water tests by Med-Tox Associates, an Anaheim-based contractor hired 
by Huntington Beach and Newport Beach, were to be conducted Saturday. However, 
residual oil believed to have been loosened as a result of morning high tides 
forced postponement of the testing, Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all set to get an answer today (Saturday), but we couldn't even test," 
Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
Groat explained that immediately after the spill, "we had extremely high tides, 
depositing oil up high on Bolsa Chica rocks, the Huntington Beach Pier and 
Newport Beach jetties and pier. Even though it looked clean, recent high tides 
produced fluctuations again. So, all the rocky areas are now being cleaned and 
we have to get that washed free of oil before any testing can be done." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, part of the cleanup army of 450 people will spray rocky shorelines 
during the next week with the same high-pressure, hot-water cleansing machines 
used to clean up the oil-polluted shoreline in the Prince William Sound area in 
Alaska following the Exxon Valdez spill. Those areas will include the Santa Ana 
River jetty, Bolsa Chica bluffs, and the Newport Beach jetties 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to blast the oil from the rocks, then collect it and remove it 
from the environment," British Petroleum's Webster said. "We've had difficulty 
with removing oil from the Santa Ana jetties because of all the nooks and 
crannies." 
</P>
<P>
Webster said British Petroleum brought in eight of the high-pressure units, 
which shoot water heated to 170 degrees, from Alaska late Friday. Four of the 
units were in use Saturday at the mouth of the Santa Ana River, where 
biologists reported, for the first time, a sheen of oil residue had entered the 
Huntington Beach wetlands earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
Although county officials have rebuilt a 15-foot-high earthen dike to block 
oil-fouled high tides from reaching the 25-acre marsh near the river mouth, 
about 100 feet of the marsh may have already been damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Webster said county bulldozers were to blame for building the dike by dredging 
oil-soaked sand from the river bottom, but others involved in the cleanup noted 
that efforts to determine the source of the sheen has been inconclusive. County 
officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup crews are taking added precautions by lowering temperatures below 90 
degrees on the pressurized hoses in the area of the Newport Beach jetties to 
protect crabs, starfish and other marine life among the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the intra-agency Post Cleanup and Health Risk Evaluation 
Committee that met Saturday, Battalion Chief Groat said that in the past, 
polluted beaches were reopened based on a "physical" rule of thumb. 
</P>
<P>
"Past practice was just a physical and visual test," Groat said. "If you can 
see it, feel it or smell it, then the beaches remained closed. There were no 
set guidelines, not in state law or federal regulations pertaining to the 
reopening of beaches." 
</P>
<P>
But after the meeting, Groat and other officials said they reached a standard 
of cleanliness that was based on other hydrocarbons and the toxic properties of 
crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, heavy surf that was expected to bring four- to five-foot breakers 
during the weekend failed to materialize and kept crowds to a minimum, said 
Steve Seim, a Huntington Beach marine safety officer. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had only a few people come down to the beach, but if I were a surfer 
this would be the last place I would go out at," Seim said. 
</P>
<P>
Business was slow for Vickie Siemon, 36, of Huntington Beach, who was selling 
T-shirts emblazoned with a dead bird and the phrase "No Apology Accepted. 
Huntington Beach Oil Spill Feb. 7, 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Sowden, 60, was visiting friends in Huntington Beach with his wife, Betty, 
also 60. The Pennsylvania natives learned of the oil spill when they were told 
of the beach ban while walking on the sands at the Huntington City Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Gaynell Raynaud, 28, on the other hand, knew of the spill. The El Toro woman 
brought her two children, Jessica, 9, and Ryan, 6, to Huntington City Beach to 
educate them about environmental destruction. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to see the real thing," Ryan said.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: BEREAVED SOMETIMES CONCLUDE INTERVIEWS WITH HEARTFELT 
'THANK YOU' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was another murder story. Three brothers were asleep on the living room 
floor of their house when a gunman kicked opened the front door and began 
shooting. One brother died, another was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
My job as the police reporter was to go to the scene and find out what happened 
and, if possible, why. It meant talking to the police, neighbors, witnesses and 
most important, relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewing bereaved loved ones is one of the most difficult parts of being a 
police reporter. The irony is that these kinds of interviews also make a good 
story better. 
</P>
<P>
It requires the reporter to walk into heart-wrenching situations and ask 
awkward and probing questions of grieving people. It requires a bedside manner 
difficult for a beginning reporter -- not something taught in journalism 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their grief, the family of the three brothers involved in the shooting 
talked about the crime. They sat me down on their couch and offered insights 
into the victims' lives. They also tried to explain what they described as a 
mysterious attack by an unknown assailant. The wife of the dead man gave me a 
picture of her husband to run in the paper. 
</P>
<P>
Others are not as cooperative. Some relatives politely decline comment, others 
become violent, calling the would-be interviewer sleazy and ghoulish. 
</P>
<P>
New to this beat, I have sometimes had to explain to myself and others why 
journalists thrust themselves into these volatile situations. I do not deny 
that there is some sensationalism involved. A dramatic interview with a 
devastated relative makes good copy. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the interviews have merit. They provide readers with a more in-depth 
account of the facts and emotions of the story. There are times, I believe, 
that the information the media provides actually helps to solve a crime, 
prevent a crime or lessen the grief of those involved. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a newspaper article is often the last public statement that will ever be 
made about a victim. It is a relative's last chance to tell the community about 
the special characteristics of their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the task is unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
I have walked into situations and found it very difficult just to begin the 
interview. Every question seems harsh and insensitive and preambled by an 
apology. 
</P>
<P>
If the victim has died as a hero, it's easier to interview relatives, who seem 
more willing to talk. For example, I interviewed the mother of a young man who 
died during the recent U.S. invasion of Panama. Despite being terribly saddened 
by the death of her son, she was eager to discuss with me his character and 
patriotic nature. 
</P>
<P>
Because the job of interviewing the bereaved is so hard, each reporter 
approaches this type of interview differently. 
</P>
<P>
I try to sympathize as much as possible with the victim's family, while 
remaining persistent. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes I offer to call relatives and go over material that I'm going to 
print to reassure them. I have found this a useful tool in avoiding errors, 
cultivating sources and obtaining a phone number where I can reach them in the 
event of new developments. 
</P>
<P>
When I finished the story of the three brothers and called a relative of the 
family about some final details, I ended the conversation by thanking her for 
her time. She took a deep breath and thanked me back. Then as I was about to 
hang up, she asked me a question: Would I send her a copy of the story? I said 
I'd be glad to.

A fire that started inside a used car up for sale caused about $150,000 in 
damage to a home Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported in the fire, which damaged the garage and 
second-story master bedroom as well as three cars inside the garage. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said the blaze started about 8 a.m. when Jackie Peters, the 
owner of the home, turned on the ignition to her 1979 Mercury Cougar in 
anticipation of the arrival of a potential buyer later in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
The car's catalytic converter overheated, sending flames and smoke out of the 
car. Peters, 59, and her son Scott Peters, 30, were able to douse the flames 
with a garden hose, but the converter continued to overheat, starting a second 
fire that quickly began to burn the garage and master bedroom directly above 
it, according to Susan Mora Wood, spokeswoman for the Costa Mesa Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters arrived at the Mandarin Drive home about 8:40 a.m. and had the 
fire under control within 40 minutes. Twenty-six crew members fought the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougar, which had 40,000 miles on it and was being sold for $3,000, as well 
as a Volkswagen Bug and a new Honda Accord were damaged in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Peters, the owner's son, said her mother has both home and auto insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just talked to her 10 minutes before the fire," said Greg Peters, who 
had planned to bring his son to stay the day at the home. "When I turned the 
corner, it was quite a mess." 
</P>
<P>
The American Red Cross provided clothes, food and prescription glasses to the 
victims.

PACIFIC SYMPHONY EXPECTED TO NAME NEW CONDUCTOR MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a search process marred by public discord, the Pacific Symphony Orchestra 
is expected to announce its new conductor and music director in a press 
conference Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Carl St. Clair, one of two assistant conductors of the Boston Symphony, has 
been a leading contender for the position, but officials would not confirm 
Saturday that he would be named. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair emerged as a top contender after leading a pair of critically and 
publicly well-received subscription concerts Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The previous front-runner, Lawrence Foster, revealed this month that the 
orchestra had offered him the music director job in December but later withdrew 
the offer after talks broke down over salary and rehearsal demands and, 
apparently, residency requirements. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair, 37, told The Times in an interview in January that he expected this 
season to be his last as assistant conductor with the Boston Symphony, although 
he will continue to lead children's concerts there. 
</P>
<P>
Also music director of the Ann Arbor (Mich.) Symphony, St. Clair has said he 
would consider moving to Orange County if offered the Pacific Symphony job. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra has been auditioning guest conductors to replace Keith Clark, who 
founded the orchestra in 1979 but was forced out in early 1988 after a bitter 
dispute with the board of directors over artistic direction and control.

MIKE PENNER: DYLAN HAS FULLERTON TANGLED UP IN BLUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By MIKE PENNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three minutes into Saturday afternoon's game at the Bren Center, UC Irvine's 
Jeff Von Lutzow tipped in a missed shot, giving the Anteaters a 7-0 lead, and a 
solitary voice rang out from the crowd: 
</P>
<P>
"Final Four, baby!" 
</P>
<P>
Not winning hasn't stopped the grinning at Irvine. With the Can't-beaters and 
their fans, a sense of humor has been the last thing to go. 
</P>
<P>
The laughs keep coming, although by sundown, the one-liner of the day was in 
need of a re-write. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters' postgame battle cry? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, four, baby. 
</P>
<P>
That's four as in 4-21, Irvine's record now. Three games ago, however, it was 
2-20, so in relative terms, things are going just great for the 'Eaters these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Saturday's 94-76 triumph over Cal State Fullerton. On Jan. 25, 
Fullerton played host to Irvine at Titan Gym and rolled to an 82-55 victory. 
One month later, they meet again and the Anteaters win by 18 points -- a 
one-game swing of 45 points. 
</P>
<P>
Some turnaround. Some month. Today, Irvine is Orange County's basketball team 
on the move and Fullerton, 0-6 since Feb. 3, is now the team mired in the dregs 
of a gnarled losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
What in the world has happened between then and now? 
</P>
<P>
You mean, besides Dylan Rigdon? 
</P>
<P>
The blowout at Fullerton wasn't a total washout for Irvine, in that Anteater 
Coach Bill Mulligan decided to junk his starting lineup immediately afterward. 
This was one negative that begat a positive, with Mulligan moving Rigdon and 
two other freshmen, Von Lutzow and Craig Marshall, into the starting five and 
keeping them there. 
</P>
<P>
If this year was in the dumpster, why not play some kids and begin tryouts for 
the 1990-91 season a little early? 
</P>
<P>
Rigdon's impact was instant. In his first start, against Fresno State, he 
scored 20 points. Irvine lost by three. The next game, against the University 
of the Pacific, Rigdon scored 22. Irvine lost by one. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters were getting closer. And last Saturday, at last, Rigdon helped 
them break through, scoring 24 points as the Anteaters stopped their 
school-record 15-game losing streak with a stunning upset at UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"That broke the ice," Rigdon says. "It kind of clicked in our heads that we're 
not as bad as we've been made out to be. We can beat some people." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not Las Vegas people. Not yet. Thursday night, Nevada Las Vegas handed 
Irvine its expected 22-point setback. 
</P>
<P>
But Fullerton people? 
</P>
<P>
Why not? 
</P>
<P>
The last time North and South Orange County collided, Irvine didn't have 
anybody sinking moonshots from all over the gym, going 7 for 7 from three-point 
land and 9 for 9 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, it did. 
</P>
<P>
In the rematch, Rigdon was a human catapult, but more than that, he was sheer 
perfection. Pick a spot on the Bren Center floor, any spot, and Rigdon was 
right on. 
</P>
<P>
All net, too. Tapes will have to be studied to determine if Rigdon so much as 
grazed the rim with any of his nine bull's-eyes. Human eyes could detect no 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a little Scott Brooks in him," mused Anteater assistant coach Tim 
Murphy, alluding to the little Irvine bomber who now plays for the Philadelphia 
76ers. Like Brooks, Rigdon has the type of high-arcing shot that brings rain. A 
hard rain, as another Dylan once wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach (Mike) Hess tells me that one of these days, I'm going to hit one of the 
lights," Rigdon said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, he nearly did. With Fullerton's Cedric Ceballos taking a 
running lunge at him, Rigdon had to sky the ball so high, it passed through 
re-entry before passing through the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to do that to get it off," Rigdon said. "You know Ceballos, he's a 
pretty big kid." 
</P>
<P>
Kid? Kid? Ceballos will have finished his second NBA season before Rigdon is 
legally old enough to drink his first beer. 
</P>
<P>
But, then, Rigdon is a freshman growing up in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior at Mater Dei High School, Rigdon was hardly recruited at all. 
Besides Irvine, Pepperdine showed the most interest. San Diego State, Montana 
and Santa Barbara also gave him a call. "I wasn't heavily recruited," Rigdon 
said. "I was just known as a shooter." 
</P>
<P>
At Irvine, that's usually enough. Rigdon averaged 19.3 points last season at 
Mater Dei and hit 195 of an astounding 223 free throw attempts, good for a 
county-high 87.7% 
</P>
<P>
From Randy Whieldon to Johnny Rogers to Scott Brooks, the gunning Anteaters 
have lived on that kind of shooting for years. 
</P>
<P>
But it took the desperation that comes with 15 consecutive losses for Rigdon to 
get the chance to add his name to the honor roll. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Mulligan has told me, 'If we weren't losing, you probably wouldn't be 
playing,' " Rigdon said. "If we were 17-10 or something, I could understand 
that. I'd accept that I wasn't good enough to play yet and I needed another 
year or two to work my way into the lineup." 
</P>
<P>
But when Irvine left Titan Gym at 2-16, Rigdon quickly became good enough. 
</P>
<P>
"Our losing gave all the freshmen a chance to play," Murphy said. "We got 
Rigdon in there, we got Von Lutzow in there. Craig started getting more than 
his usual five to 10 minutes a game. 
</P>
<P>
"The freshmen are playing and they're gaining great confidence in themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Chalk it up as a step in the proper direction. Final Four? At Irvine, they'll 
gladly settle for finally forward.

SOUTHERN SECTION MASTERS WRESTLING; 
</P>
<P>
FOUR FROM COUNTY WIN CHAMPIONSHIPS

<P>
Last season, Rick Monge walked away from the Southern Section Masters wrestling 
tournament down and out. After entering with high expectations, the wrestler 
from Mater Dei High School lost his first two matches and the chance to compete 
at the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
He eased that memory on Saturday by defeating Rim of the World's Jason Roberts, 
5-2, to win the 145-pound Masters tournament championship at Fountain Valley 
High School. Monge advances to the state meet next weekend at the University of 
the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, I just wanted to make sure I got to state," said Monge. "I was kind 
of disappointed last year." 
</P>
<P>
Monge was one of four Orange County wrestlers to win championships Saturday. 
Canyon's Zach Cooper, who pinned three opponents, won his 91st consecutive 
match in the 191-pound final and teammate Jason Mitchell won the 138-pound 
championship. Savanna's Tony Okada won the 132-pound division. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 17 county wrestlers advanced to the state meet by finishing in the top 
six in their respective weight class. Canyon qualified six wrestlers for the 
Masters meet at last week's divisional championships, San Clemente and Edison 
each qualified two wrestlers. 
</P>
<P>
Monge said he was especially frustrated last year because he had been ill two 
or three weeks before the Masters and was at less than full strength when he 
lost a pair of one-point matches. Adding to Monge's frustration was the fact 
that he beat the 132-pound state champion, Arroyo's Elfrin Gonzales, during the 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, an inspired Monge (46-1) met Roberts in the final. Monge, a senior, had 
beaten Roberts, 2-1, at a tournament three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I finished a lot stronger on my takedowns this time," Monge said. "The last 
time I was kind of sloppy. This time I drove in harder with more intensity." 
</P>
<P>
Okada, who placed fifth in the state meet last year at 126 pounds, raised his 
record to 46-0, defeating Coachella Valley's Albert Morales, 13-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected it to be tougher," Okada said of his victory. "I used my quickness. 
I beat him on my feet." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon, which won its third Southern Section 4-A championship in four years 
last week, was the only county school with two champions. If not for what Coach 
Gary Bowden called "some bad luck," Canyon may have qualified more than two 
wrestlers. 
</P>
<P>
Tom McCullogh (119 pounds) was battling the flu, Bowden said, and lost his 
first two matches. Matt Padgett (154 pounds) was bothered by a knee injury he 
sustained in practice Thursday and couldn't finish his second-round match in 
the losers' bracket. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected to get two in," Bowden said. "We've wrestled great all year and 
haven't had many problems with injuries or sickness, so maybe it was our turn." 
</P>
<P>
Jason Booth (112 pounds) and Josh Kitner (98 pounds) qualified for San 
Clemente. Chad Stansbury (138) and Brian Burgess (132 pounds) advanced for 
Edison.

GRADCO STRUGGLES TO REPRODUCE PROFIT; 
</P>
<P>
ENTREPRENEURS: KEY PATENTS HAVEN'T SHIELDED THE IRVINE-BASED MAKER OF COPIER 
ACCESSORIES FROM LOSSES. CHIEF EXECUTIVE KEITH B. STEWART IS BATTLING TO 
RESTORE HIS COMPANY'S FORTUNES. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keith B. Stewart, an articulate man with a graying beard and a stern demeanor, 
has built a company that looks on the surface like a classic entrepreneurial 
success. In little more than 10 years, his Irvine-based Gradco Systems Inc. has 
grown from a lowly distributor of paper-feeders to a $100-million company that 
claims a virtual monopoly on certain copy machine accessories. 
</P>
<P>
And with the continued proliferation of copiers, computer printers and fax 
machines, a company specializing in sorters and paper-feeders would seem to 
have a great future, especially when it can boast, as Gradco does, of broad 
patents and strong relationships with the major Japanese electronics companies. 
</P>
<P>
But Gradco has never quite lived up to Wall Street's expectations. Stock was 
initially offered to the public in 1983 at $18 a share, and it now languishes 
around $9. A proposed management-led buyout announced by Stewart last fall -- 
which drove the stock to $19 -- never materialized, apparently because the 
Japanese financiers who were backing the deal grew skittish. And last month 
Gradco announced an unexpected quarterly loss and a sharp decline in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
While Stewart maintains that these setbacks are temporary, others are not so 
sure. Gradco recently lost a key contract to supply sorters to Xerox Corp., and 
analysts suggest that other copier companies may find ways to design around 
Gradco's patents. Some have also raised questions about Stewart's management 
style, and both Gradco and Stewart are facing several unrelated lawsuits 
alleging various forms of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, a controversial figure described by associates in terms ranging from 
"excellent manager" to "autocratic, charming and ruthless," says the lawsuits 
are all groundless. And he maintains that the poor quarterly results were an 
aberration that will be emphatically corrected in the coming year. "Demand for 
our products is greater than ever," Stewart said in an interview. "We have 
contracts with every major copier manufacturer going forward." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some securities analysts still believe Gradco has a lot of potential. A 
recent report from the Los Angeles brokerage Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards 
states that the company has a "bright, long-term future" and predicts that 
either a buyout or simply good operating performance will drive the stock back 
up to at least to the $12 level and possibly much higher. New York-based Plenum 
Publishing Corp. now owns about 8% of Gradco's shares and has said it might 
pursue a takeover, though most analysts discount that possibility and say a 
Japanese takeover is more likely. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart has taken the offensive in countering the recent troubles, and is now 
putting the finishing touches on a complex restructuring of Gradco that will 
shift the core operations to Japan. A management buyout, he said, still remains 
a possibility, as does a takeover by another firm or a public offering of the 
beefed-up Japanese subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring plan calls for Gradco's Japanese subsidiary to assume 
operational responsibility for all copier products, which account for some 70% 
of Gradco's revenue and include the patented "moving bin" sorter that has long 
been the core of Gradco's business. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining operating entity in the United States will be called Gradco 
Printer Products and will be headed by a new president, with candidates now 
being recruited from outside the company. Gradco Systems in Irvine will 
effectively become a holding company for the operating entities, carrying out 
some basic research and development as well as corporate finance and 
acquisition functions. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese unit will be headed by Mark Takeuchi, whose track record includes 
a long stint at C. Itoh &amp; Co., and Gradco Japan will establish its own 
subsidiary in the United States under the name Gradco Systems America. Ikegami 
Tsushinki Ltd. of Japan and Sindo-Ricoh &amp; Co. Ltd. of South Korea will take 
small equity stakes in the Japanese company and will be responsible for all 
engineering and manufacturing of Gradco's copier and printer products, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The equity stakes, whose exact size has not been determined, constitute a 
"predistribution" of shares that would speed up any future public offering of 
the Japanese subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said equity or joint venture partners will also be sought for the 
U.S.-based printer business, and a new distribution network for those products 
will either be internally developed or acquired. The fate of Gradco's 
100-employee Santa Ana manufacturing facility has not yet been determined, but 
it might be closed. 
</P>
<P>
"On the surface, the printer and copier markets look very much the same," 
Stewart said in explaining the reorganization. "But the more you look at them, 
they are totally different markets with products sold through entirely 
different channels, and they take different sets of skills and experience." The 
new manufacturing arrangements will yield substantial cost reductions, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart hopes the new structure will enable Gradco to build up the 
printer-products side of the business to 50% of revenue and reduce the 
company's heavy dependence on copying machine sorters. The moving-bin sorters, 
which consist of a column of as many as 20 paper bins that move up and down to 
catch the copies as they emerge from the machine, are the technology of choice 
for small office copiers known as "convenience copiers." 
</P>
<P>
Gradco has attributed its recent woes -- a quarterly loss of $1.5 million on 
revenue of $20.5 million, contrasted with a profit of $1.4 million and revenue 
of $30.4 million a year ago -- to the loss of a major contract, product delays 
on the part of the copier manufacturers and problems in getting some of its own 
printer products out the door. Stewart confirmed that the lost contract was 
with Xerox Corp., one of the company's oldest and biggest customers. 
</P>
<P>
Xerox still does business with Gradco, and Stewart notes that Fuji Xerox of 
Japan remains a major customer. But the fact that Xerox is increasingly using 
its own sorter technology points to a potentially broader problem for Gradco. 
Much of Wall Street's enthusiasm for the stock over the past five years grew 
out of the perception that Gradco had a virtual monopoly in its niche, and that 
is becoming less and less the case. 
</P>
<P>
"There are ways to get around the patents," said Robert Sostilio, who follows 
copiers for the market research firm Dataquest. If copier manufacturers can 
develop their own technology, they can make their own sorters and not rely on 
products or licenses from Gradco. Nicholas Pantazis, an analyst with the New 
York stock research firm Monness Crespi &amp; Hardt, added, "Gradco has had the 
most effective technology, but not the only technology." 
</P>
<P>
A former Gradco executive who asked not to be identified said the company had 
done "a very poor job of taking advantage of its place in the market," 
remaining far too dependent on moving-bin sorters. Gradco's effort to penetrate 
the printer-feeder business through the acquisition of Ziyad Inc. in 1986 for 
$24.5 million has had mixed results, and Gradco's newest market -- sorters for 
fax machines that would route incoming documents to personalized mailboxes -- 
is unlikely to develop for some years. 
</P>
<P>
The dent in Gradco's image that became visible last year was especially 
ill-timed for the firm, coming just as Stewart was trying to put together a 
management buyout. After a run-up in the stock price, Stewart disclosed last 
September that he was pursuing a buyout and had retained the Lodestar Group for 
financial advice. But on Dec. 1, after several days of rumors, Stewart revealed 
that the financing had fallen through. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said Ysuda Trust Co. and Yamaichi Securities were both part of the 
proposed buyout, though he would not confirm reports that the buyout consisted 
of a novel plan to take the company private and then refloat it on the Japanese 
stock exchange. This would have enabled Gradco to take advantage of the fact 
that share prices in Japan are far higher for the same level of earnings than 
they are in the United States, and it made sense for the company because so 
many of its major customers are in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The Gradco deal was still being put together when the failure of the United 
Airlines leveraged buyout cast a pall over all such transactions, Stewart said, 
though he conceded that the earnings problems may also have contributed to the 
collapse of the deal. Stewart owns 12% of Gradco's shares and indirectly 
controls another 11%. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Gilday of Gruntal &amp; Co. in New York and several other analysts said 
the buyout discussions diverted the attention of Stewart and other Gradco 
executives from the day-to-day operations of the business, contributing to the 
poor results. Stewart rejects the criticism. "It's just not that time-consuming 
a process," he said, adding that the bad results were caused by factors beyond 
his -- or anyone else's -- control. 
</P>
<P>
Some outside observers agree that Gradco's difficulties are nothing out of the 
ordinary. Elliot Steinberg, a San Francisco investment manager who helped 
advise the wealthy Pritzker family when it bought a 6% stake in Gradco, said 
the problems were similar to those experienced by many small companies. 
"They've just fallen behind in their game plan," Steinberg said. "But they 
should make up for it this year." 
</P>
<P>
Frank K. Moore, a former Gradco director who owns an Orange County copier 
dealer, said he believed the company has scraped bottom and "the upside 
potential is excellent." Gradco, he said, has "gone through some struggles" but 
is now in "better shape than ever." 
</P>
<P>
One securities analyst criticized the investment community for not looking more 
closely at the company and for building up expectations that could not be met. 
Stewart echoed this notion, saying there had been a lot of speculation over the 
last several years. He attributed the financial community's interest to the 
fact that it was a niche company with a strong market position whose business 
was easy to understand. But while $19 a share might have been based on takeover 
speculation, at $9 the stock is undervalued, he added. 
</P>
<P>
But some Gradco watchers remain wary of the company, in part because of Stewart 
himself. A native of the United Kingdom who was raised in Rhodesia, Stewart -- 
who lives in Laguna Beach and drives a Rolls-Royce with "GRADCO" license plates 
-- tends to evoke strong reactions from those who come in contact with him. 
While many associates praise him as a dynamic businessman with a tremendous 
amount of energy and excellent sales skills, others say he is autocratic, 
unable to delegate authority and disrespectful of those who disagree with him. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Shea, who co-founded Gradco with Stewart as a simple collator distributor 
in 1972, describes Stewart as an excellent salesman who can be very charming 
but can also be very ruthless. Shea, now the owner of Entrepreneur magazine, 
said he and Stewart no longer talk. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts question his management style. "It's definitely a one-man show," said 
Donna Hostetler, an analyst with Crowell Weedon &amp; Co. in Los Angeles. 
"Whatever Stewart wants, he'll get. I don't think the company is run by the 
board of directors. When a company gets to a certain size, you have to start 
delegating, and I don't think he's done that." 
</P>
<P>
Gilday of Gruntal &amp; Co., a one-time touter of Gradco stock when she was 
with McKinley Allsopp, added: "Steps have been taken that have failed, and the 
business has dropped off, so I don't give him high marks." 
</P>
<P>
But Moore called Stewart "dynamic, intelligent and very creative in the way he 
does business," though he said Stewart had in the past made some mistakes in 
choosing managerial talent. "He has given up the reins and it hasn't worked 
out; he's had to step back in." 
</P>
<P>
Two former employees have much harsher criticism for Stewart. In separate but 
related lawsuits filed in Connecticut, John C. Hamma and R. Clark Dubois, both 
former Gradco engineers, allege that they were the co-inventors of the sorter 
technology and that Stewart fraudulently deprived them of royalty payments. 
</P>
<P>
They charge that Stewart induced them to accept lump sum payments in lieu of a 
percentage of sales by misrepresenting the status of Gradco's efforts to 
license the technology to major copier manufacturers. Hamma also alleges that 
he was intimidated by Stewart and threatened with termination if he hired a 
lawyer, and Dubois claims he was fired and locked out of his office for 
complaining. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said the claims are completely without merit. Gradco's key technology, 
he said, was invented by Frederick J. Lawrence, who remains the company's chief 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart also has been sued for $6 million by Alton Laguna Partners, owner of 
Gradco's headquarters in the Irvine Spectrum. Alton Laguna alleges that Gradco 
backed out of a deal for an expansion of the office space after the partnership 
refused to enter a "usurious" loan agreement with an off-shore company 
affiliated with Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart called the allegations "fictitious" and "a joke," and said he had 
refused a recent offer to settle the case out of court. Robert Beauchamp, an 
attorney representing Alton Laguna, said his client offered to settle for $3 
million. "We are not concerned about the strength of our case; we think it's 
very strong," Beauchamp said. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the failed management buyout, Gradco also has been sued by 
several shareholders claiming breach of fiduciary duties. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart has in the past suffered reversals in the courtroom. In 1986, an Orange 
County Superior Court judge ruled that Stewart had fraudulently persuaded his 
wife to accept a $750,000 divorce settlement in 1983 by concealing from her the 
true value of Gradco. Under the settlement, Connie Stewart agreed to give up 
any claim to 2.1 million Gradco shares the Stewarts owned. A day after the 
agreement was signed, Gradco sent a letter to shareholders announcing its plans 
for a public stock offering, which eventually valued those shares at more than 
$37 million. 
</P>
<P>
The case was subsequently settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how many feathers he has ruffled, though, Stewart can still lay claim 
to building a successful company that competes in a part of industry where few 
American companies dare tread. Standing in the lobby of Gradco's headquarters, 
Stewart gestures brusquely at row of plaques on the wall -- quality awards from 
International Business Machines and several other companies. "Why does everyone 
look at the negative and never talk about that?" he grumbles. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if Stewart's latest plan succeeds, Wall Street may again be talking 
about Gradco as a great American entrepreneurial success.

The moving bin sorter, which Gradco developed and patented, is considered the 
best technology for collating documents on small and mid-size copiers. Most 
copier manufacturers offer it as an accessory on their machines, and either buy 
it from Gradco or manufacture it under license.

</P>
<P>
ENTERPRISE: ERIC DAVIS, DARRYL STRAWBERRY AND REGINALD MONTGOMERY SHARE 
BASEBALL AND A BUSINESS IN THE TOUGH NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THEY GREW UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a run-down section of South Broadway in South-Central Los Angeles, a 
sparkling white Porsche convertible pulls up in front of a modest storefront. 
Out of the car steps Eric Davis, who will earn $3 million for each of the next 
three years patrolling center field for the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, a dirty-faced homeless man pushes a shopping cart past the storefront 
and an adjoining Baptist church and aluminum-can reclamation yard. So what is 
Davis, natty in a dark business suit and patent leather black loafers, doing 
here? 
</P>
<P>
Inside the storefront is All Star Custom Interiors, a business started three 
months ago by Davis, fellow baseball star Darryl Strawberry, who plays right 
field for the New York Mets, and their high-school chum and ex-minor league 
ballplayer, Reginald Montgomery, all of whom are 27. The firm sells custom 
bathroom fixtures, carpeting and other interior goods to contractors and 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
For Davis, who has a house in Woodland Hills, and Strawberry, who has an Encino 
residence, All Star gives them an opportunity to learn a new skill that they 
hope to use after the major leagues. "Baseball isn't always going to be there," 
Davis said. "This was a challenge to me to learn the products, learn the 
business world, learn how to deal with people outside of baseball." 
</P>
<P>
And to hear Davis and Montgomery tell it -- Strawberry couldn't because he 
failed to show up for an interview -- the business also is their way of helping 
improve South-Central Los Angeles, where the three men grew up. Davis and 
Montgomery went to Fremont High School in nearby Compton, and Strawberry 
attended rival Crenshaw High. 
</P>
<P>
Each man owns one-third of All Star, which they initially capitalized with 
about $50,000. But they have since spent thousands more building their showroom 
and ordering supplies for resale to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and Strawberry also are on the promotion trail; their appearances on TV 
sports talk shows typically include a plug for the new venture. 
</P>
<P>
All Star also isn't shy about dropping the names of celebrities who have bought 
its goods. When a visitor recently stopped at its showroom, Montgomery pointed 
to a stack of boxes in a corner and said they were destined for the home of 
Byron Scott of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team. Laker Michael Cooper 
also is a customer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The ballplayers' investment in All Star is still a pittance given the salaries 
of Davis and Strawberry, who earned $1.8 million last year. Indeed, they could 
have opened All Star in a swank area, but they chose South Broadway "to try to 
upgrade our community," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"People around here like nice things," he said. "They might not be able to 
afford all of the high-end stuff, but they can afford the medium-range stuff, 
like a Jacuzzi tub. We could probably do 100% more residential business if we 
were in Beverly Hills or Woodland Hills, but that would be taking away from our 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
"Just by putting our building here, other businesses on this street are trying 
to upgrade their businesses," he added. "It's a positive image in the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
All Star's single-story showroom, which is not much bigger than a master 
bedroom, features such high-end items as a $1,600 royal blue toilet and a 
$4,000 black bathtub with gold-plated fixtures and Jacuzzi. Davis and 
Montgomery said such items are meant mainly for upper-crust individuals who 
come by to see what is available, and that All Star sells much more mundane and 
lower-priced goods as well. 
</P>
<P>
Among the products All Star sells are bathroom fixtures made by Kohler Co. of 
Kohler, Wis., Bob Gold, the company's zone manager for Los Angeles, said "we 
admire their philosophy on developing a business and returning something to the 
neighborhood where they grew up." 
</P>
<P>
All Star is not a passing fancy that the ballplayers grubstaked in order to 
help their old friend Montgomery, they said. "It was something we had talked 
about for numerous years, going into some type of business," said Davis, who 
spends several hours a week at the store during the off-season. And his 
interest in decorating precedes All Star. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' mother has been an amateur interior designer for many years, he said, 
and "It rubbed off on me." Davis said he has thrice rearranged the furnishings 
in his Woodland Hills home, where he lives with his girlfriend, Sherry Brewer, 
and their 4-year-old daughter, Erica. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, Davis is still learning the fine points of managing a business 
-- and mastering its jargon. Although he is all grace on the diamond, in an 
interview he gets tongue-tied trying to describe All Star's profit potential 
and confuses its gross sales, net sales and low overhead. But his point is 
clear: He thinks All Star will break even after its first year. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Montgomery will be the day-to-day boss, running the firm while 
Davis and Strawberry try to hit 90 m.p.h. fastballs eight months out of the 
year. That suits Davis fine, because he and Montgomery are close friends. 
</P>
<P>
Although Montgomery also unsuccessfully tried to become a major league 
ballplayer, he was familiar with the home-furnishings business; his father, Ed 
Montgomery, has been a building contractor for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
After Reginald's five-year effort to make the big leagues ended in 1988 -- a 
USC star, he was only a step away from the majors, having played at the 
Triple-A level in the minors for the California Angels and Baltimore Orioles -- 
he joined his father as a trouble-shooter, helping other builders and 
developers locate interior supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The need for Montgomery's services persuaded him, Davis and Strawberry in 1989 
that they should start a business that helps interior designers, contractors 
and developers order faucets, carpeting, sinks and the like. 
</P>
<P>
Those professionals -- who are often buying in bulk -- will account for up to 
80% of All Star's business, while individuals shopping for themselves will 
account for the rest, Davis said. Montgomery said the company has no sales goal 
for its first year because, "We didn't want to set any goals. We wanted the 
market to dictate what we could do." 
</P>
<P>
Davis and Strawberry also will have fax machines and personal computers in 
their respective Cincinnati and New York homes, so that they can receive 
frequent updates on All Star's business. Still, Montgomery doesn't pretend that 
in the heat of a pennant race, Davis and Strawberry will be too concerned with 
peddling bathroom wares. 
</P>
<P>
As Montgomery noted, "You can't worry about toilets and bidets and try to hit a 
slider from Bert Blyleven."

COVER STORY: LIFE BEYOND 'THIRTYSOMETHING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel Cerone 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years ago, when Timothy Busfield was a needy, 22-year-old actor trying to 
break into the business, he suddenly found himself confronted with two job 
offers at once. One was for a role in the feature film "Tex," with Matt Dillon, 
which paid $10,000 for 10 days of work; the other was to play Lars in Hugh 
Leonard's "A Life" at the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Conn., which paid 
$3,200 for 10 weeks of work. 
</P>
<P>
"I took the play. It was a better part," Busfield said the other day over lunch 
in Sherman Oaks, near his home. "It was a part I wanted to do. I realized then, 
and I sort of made a pact with myself, to always leave myself open to find the 
roles that will allow me to grow. And I'll choose at that time the direction I 
want to go." 
</P>
<P>
The direction of Busfield's professional path now is a subtle reflection of 
what's most important in the actor's personal life -- his family. 
</P>
<P>
In his third season as Elliot in ABC's "thirtysomething," Busfield is trying to 
patch up his relationship with his television wife, Nancy, who is recuperating 
from a cancer operation. And on Wednesday at 9 p.m., Busfield will narrate the 
Lifetime cable documentary, "Don't Divorce the Children," which explores 
divorce through the eyes of children. 
</P>
<P>
The subject strikes close to Busfield's heart. "I am a product of divorce," he 
said. "Not only because my parents were divorced, but I have a son who I'm 
trying to raise who doesn't live with me at the time. And I have to adjust to 
that. And he has to adjust to that. It's a constant struggle." 
</P>
<P>
The warm, red-headed actor spoke gently and deliberately, with compassion 
rarely seen in the Peter Pan behavior that inflicts his "thirtysomething" alter 
ego. In addition to his 7-year-old son, Willy, Busfield is raising a newborn 
daughter, Daisy, with his second wife, Jenny. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I will say to each other, 'Well, the odds are that our kids will 
probably be the product of a divorce. The odds are that our kids will get 
divorced.' 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, my wife and I have very strong feelings about this, and that's why I 
liked this (cable) project. It seems like everybody we know has been affected 
by divorce." 
</P>
<P>
To be precise, one-half of all marriages fail, according to figures recited by 
Busfield in "Don't Divorce the Children." Children have a 1-in-5 chance of 
experiencing two divorces by the time they are 18. "Divorce happens, you know," 
Busfield said quietly. "Nobody is going to tell you that you can't let it 
happen. And you shouldn't get on your own case because a marriage didn't work 
out between you and somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
"But what you should do is pay attention to the fact that there are other 
parties involved, and they need the best of you and not just the worst of you. 
That's what hooked me into doing this documentary." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't Divorce the Children" was produced for Lifetime by Academy Award-winning 
documentary producer Malcolm Clarke. The hourlong documentary explores the 
effects of divorce on children and offers suggestions to parents. The program 
will be followed by "After Words," a half-hour panel discussion hosted by Jane 
Wallace on helping children cope with divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Understanding children and creating opportunities for them is nothing new to 
Busfield. In 1986, he and his brother, Buck, founded The Fantasy Theatre in 
Sacramento. The five-member troupe of adult actors -- who do 12 shows a week, 
36 weeks a year -- is the state's only professional touring children's theater, 
performing and conducting writing workshops mostly in Northern California. If a 
child writes a good play, the troupe performs it professionally. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started the theater, I was single, unattached, alone and unemployed. I 
needed it," Busfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Prophetically, Busfield's first stage role was Puck in "Robin Goodfellow," a 
children's version of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at East Tennessee State 
University. He got his professional start with the Actors Theater of Louisville 
in Kentucky, which soon led to Broadway as Matthew Broderick's understudy in 
Neil Simon's "Brighton Beach Memoirs." 
</P>
<P>
Busfield found a bigger audience on TV as Pernell Roberts' son in "Trapper 
John, M.D.," before "thirtysomething" made him a household name -- at least in 
young, upwardly mobile households. 
</P>
<P>
"If I wanted people to say one thing about me, it would be that for a fool, 
he's awfully lucky," Busfield said. "Nobody drops the ball and fumbles more 
than I do. I don't want people to think of me in a higher level. I'm a lucky 
tradesman, not a mysterious idol." 
</P>
<P>
Busfield has recently backed off from his involvement in The Fantasy Theatre, 
choosing instead to concentrate on his own children. He owns a second house on 
the Sacramento River Delta, surrounded by natural, wide-open beauty, where he 
frequently escapes with his family. 
</P>
<P>
"My family figures into everything I do now," he said. "I don't want to be 
apart from this family. Ever. What's good for them is infinitely more important 
than what job I take. And if that means passing up the lead in a movie that 
Sydney Pollack is directing, then so be it."

Put a gold star up on the board next to CBS for televising "Family of Spies." 
</P>
<P>
It was excellent. What a welcome relief from some of those idiotic situation 
comedy shows with canned laughter. "Family of Spies" was deserving of Emmy 
nominations. Encore!

Dead Ringers (HBO Sunday at 9 p.m.): Stylish horrormeister's David Cronenberg's 
icy masterpiece in which Jeremy Irons plays brilliant but disintegrating twin 
gynecologists. Not for the squeamish. (2:00) 
</P>
<P>
Le Grande Chemin (Bravo Monday at 8 p.m.): Jean-Loup Hubert's acute 1987 
autobiographical film starring his own son Antoine as a shy city boy adjusting 
to an unhappy rural household. With Richard Bohringer, Anemone and glowing, 
10-year-old Vanessa Guedj. (1:44) 
</P>
<P>
The Killers (Channel 5 Tuesday at 3:30 a.m.): Don Siegel's terse 1964 version 
of the Hemingway tale, with Angie Dickinson, John Cassavetes, and as the heavy, 
Ronald Reagan, in his final film role. (2:00) 
</P>
<P>
Harry in Your Pocket (Channel 13 Wednesday at 10 a.m.): This is a pleasant, 
offbeat diversion -- a slender 1973 tale about pickpockets, with a wonderful 
cast: James Coburn, Walter Pidgeon (who steals the show), Michael Sarrazin and 
Trish Van Devere. (2:00) 
</P>
<P>
Patti Rocks (Cinemax Thursday at midnight): David Burton Morris' scabrously 
funny sequel to his much earlier "Loose Ends" in which a foul-mouthed womanizer

THE CHALLENGE OF 'CHALLENGER'; 
</P>
<P>
HOW ABC'S SUNDAY NIGHT MOVIE FINALLY GOT OFF THE GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the morning of Jan. 28, 1986, much of the nation tuned into coverage of the 
Challenger space shuttle launch and watched in horror as the shuttle exploded 
within seconds of takeoff, snuffing out the lives of its seven astronauts. 
Among them was Christa McAuliffe, the first private citizen to fly in space. 
</P>
<P>
The lives of those five men and two women and the technical problems that 
plagued the mission from the outset are the subject of "Challenger," a 
three-hour movie premiering tonight at 8 on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Allen, best known for her starring role in "Raiders of the Lost Ark," 
plays McAuliffe. Brian Kerwin is featured as shuttle pilot Mike Smith and Barry 
Bostwick portrays shuttle commander Dick Scobee. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Allen didn't want to have anything to do with the project. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think the tragedy was something I'd like to make a film about," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She was more open to "Challenger" after she read the script written by the 
film's co-executive producer, George Englund. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really a homage to the seven astronauts and was not exploitative in 
anyway," she said. "The fact that he never showed the accident and concentrated 
on their lives and who they were -I really found it wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
But Allen was eventually won over because of McAuliffe, the high school teacher 
and mother from Concord, New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she was one of those people who makes America great," Allen said. "She 
had a real positive outlook on life. She was very dedicated to being involved 
in the community and in other people's lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a few extraordinary teachers in my life -I feel they really influenced 
the course of my life. I have a feeling she was that kind of person. She had 
the ability to make you feel your life counts." 
</P>
<P>
In preparation, Allen spent hours watching and re-watching videos of McAuliffe. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched her early press conferences and read quite a few interviews with 
her," she said. 
</P>
<P>
By studying the tapes, Allen said, she was able to capture McAuliffe's "rhythm" 
-- how she walked, talked, stood and even how she held her head. By the time 
Allen arrived at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston last summer to shoot 
"Challenger," the actress felt a kinship to McAuliffe. 
</P>
<P>
"You're entering another person's life and world and getting to know them," she 
said. "You become acquainted with them in a very intimate way as you look into 
their lives and talk to people who knew them. You get drawn into a world you 
otherwise wouldn't get to know." 
</P>
<P>
At NASA, Allen worked alongside the same people who knew and worked with 
McAuliffe. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when we were first there," she recalled, "there was a little 
tentativeness. They were checking us out and trying to see how serious we were. 
I think in the process there were some really nice exchanges between the group 
of actors and the people working there. I think basically they felt that what 
we were doing was good." 
</P>
<P>
Allen went through a lot of the same training McAuliffe did, including a pilot 
training course so she could obtain a special license to fly in the KC-135-the 
plane that simulates weightlessness. However, she never went up in the plane. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a crack in the wheel joint, and they had to cancel our trip," Allen 
said. "There wasn't time for us to go on it again." 
</P>
<P>
But she did get the chance to spend time in the decompression chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to experience the symptoms of hypoxia-the lack of oxygen," she said. 
"You can pass out, get very dizzy, become belligerent or get hot flashes and 
cold chills. My first symptoms were hot flashes. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's symptoms are different. Once you discover what yours are, you 
always have the same symptoms. It's fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
Spending a month at the Johnson Space Center was an unforgettable experience 
for Allen. She admitted that she wouldn't mind becoming the first 
actress/astronaut. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be thrilled to go up," she said "I think I should go up if I have the 
opportunity to do it. I got such a wonderful taste of the program and their 
plans for the future. I find it all remarkably interesting." 
</P>
<P>
It took co-executive producer/ writer George Englund nearly two years to get 
NASA's cooperation on "Challenger." 
</P>
<P>
"I've got the scar tissue," said the veteran producer, whose credits include 
the acclaimed 1988 CBS movie, "Terrorist on Trial: Salim Ajami." 
</P>
<P>
"The first people I talked to were the heads of the astronaut programs who said 
they could not see any possible use in the project. They were real hurt. It was 
their friends who had perished. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the most devastating thing that had happened in the history of the 
agency. The future of NASA was unclear. They had a subconscious disposition to 
think a producer was looking for the exploitable parts and aspects of it. That 
wasn't my thought. It took them a while to understand that." 
</P>
<P>
Englund, though, experienced even more difficulty approaching the families of 
the Challenger astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
"They above everybody else didn't want to have anything to do with anything 
about the accident," he said. "Eventually, I showed them the versions of the 
script, and they felt some things were inaccurate. So I corrected those things. 
My aim in all of this was to get it right. I hope the film lands close to the 
target." 
</P>
<P>
"I knew nothing about the astronauts before going into the project," said Brian 
Kerwin, who plays shuttle pilot Mike Smith. "I saw the Challenger disaster on 
the news once and then stayed away from the news for the next two days. It was 
hideous." 
</P>
<P>
Like co-star Karen Allen, Kerwin had qualms about "Challenger" because, he 
said, "the subject lends itself so easily to a tabloidesque exploitation." But 
he found the script a sensitive re-enactment of the event. 
</P>
<P>
At the Johnson Space Center, Kerwin found support from NASA employees, 
especially astronaut trainer Frank Hughes, who had instructed the Challenger 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it was a catharsis for him or not, but Frank ended up writing 
me and the other actors involved letters saying 'thanks for sort of helping me 
put the accident a little more behind me.' It's not easy to work with people

SKATER KUCHIKI OVERCOMES TEARS AND FEARS; 
</P>
<P>
FIGURE SKATING: NOW COMES THE EASY PART FOR YOUNG OLYMPIC HOPEFUL, WHO WILL 
COMPETE IN WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS.

<P>
Getting Natasha Kuchiki, the underage U. S. pairs skater, into the coming World 
Championships was the easy part. All it took was a little bureaucratic 
wrangling. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the U. S. Figure Skating Assn. made a long-distance call to 
the president of the august International Skating Union, the sport's ultimate 
authority. The ISU president went to the ISU Council, which took the matter 
under consideration and finally agreed to waive its age restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Getting Kuchiki into the rink, now that was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Nine months ago, when Kuchiki was still 12, Coach John Nicks proposed teaming 
her with one of his star pupils, Todd Sand. 
</P>
<P>
Sand was twice Kuchiki's age, 25 at the time. He was apprehensive. Kuchiki was 
mortified, so "scared and nervous" at first, she said, that she often had to be 
persuaded to get out of her mother's car for practice at the Ice Capades Chalet 
in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"One time we drove down there and she was crying in the car and we had to drive 
all the way back home," said Denise Kuchiki, Natasha's mother. "She'd been 
hearing she was too young and she was afraid she was going to make a fool of 
herself." 
</P>
<P>
The fear of flopping, however, went away almost as soon as the pair got on the 
ice together and saw the potential for something exciting. 
</P>
<P>
"A few things just clicked," Sand said. 
</P>
<P>
On only their third day as a team, Kuchiki said, "we did a triple Salchow." 
</P>
<P>
But even though they were jelling on the ice, their relationship was in the 
deep freeze. According to Denise, Natasha had to ask Sand to stop calling her 
"the little girl." 
</P>
<P>
"The first two or three weeks weren't easy," Nicks said. "With young people, 
acute changes are very difficult. And even though Natasha is such a good skater 
for her age, emotionally she's still very young. But after a couple of weeks of 
practice it became apparent to me -- and I think to them -- that great 
improvement was beginning to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Denise needed all the motherly wisdom she could muster to convince her 
then preteen daughter that the new partnership would work. 
</P>
<P>
"The scariest part was wondering whether Natasha was going to mature and listen 
like a grown-up or act like a little girl," said Denise, who said she 
encouraged the partnership because she knew what a good skater Todd was. 
</P>
<P>
On the long drives from the Kuchiki's home in Canoga Park to Costa Mesa, Denise 
tried to calm her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a lot of talking and explaining," Denise said. "I told her she was at 
a fork in the road and she just had to believe in me." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Natasha admits that mother knew best. She and Todd have become close 
friends -- "He's the brother I never had," she says -- as well as this 
country's future Olympic hopefuls in pairs skating. Just a few weeks ago, they 
finished a surprising second in the U.S. national championships, behind Kristi 
Yamaguchi and Rudi Galindo, and qualified for next month's World Championships 
in Halifax, Canada, where Kuchiki will be the youngest competitor. 
</P>
<P>
"To start from nothing and be good enough to be on the U.S. team nine months 
later is pretty much a record," said Nicks, who has coached such world-class 
pairs as JoJo Starbuck-Ken Shelley and Tai Babilonia-Randy Gardner. "I've never 
had a pair improve as quickly as Todd and Natasha." 
</P>
<P>
As they glide across the ice to the amplified sounds of "Tequila," Sand and 
Kuchiki are moving as one. Sand, 5-feet-11 and 165, lifts her effortlessly and 
then throws her as if she were a doll. Kuchiki, 5-2 and 107, spins through the 
air and lands perfectly. Sand catches up and they continue their routine in 
sync. The obvious question to everybody watching them: What age difference? 
</P>
<P>
"They're both wonderfully strong skaters," said Nicks, an Englishman who won 
European skating titles in the 1950s. "Individually, they've got great ability. 
As a team, the improvement has to come from the artistic and interpretive 
side." 
</P>
<P>
In skating, women supposedly mature faster than men. Sand is just hitting peak 
form, Nicks said. 
</P>
<P>
A skater since he was 8, Sand grew up in Panorama City and went to L. A. 
Baptist High before his parents moved to Thousand Oaks. His father is Danish 
and Sand has dual citizenship, which enabled him to compete for Denmark in 
singles at the World Championships in the early '80s. He won the Danish 
national title twice and thought about staying in Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
"But I came back to the U.S. to skate pairs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuchiki was raised in a skating family. Her parents, Denise and Sashi, skated 
in the Ice Capades and her older sister, Tamara, 15, is also an accomplished 
skater, although she is currently sidelined with injuries. Skating is their 
life. Instead of going to high school, the girls take correspondence courses 
from Black Mountain Academy in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Natasha and her partner, Richard Alexander, finished second in 
junior pairs at the U. S. Nationals and placed first in both the Southwest 
Pacific and Pacific Coast regionals. But soon afterward, she and Alexander 
split up. About then, Sand also needed a new partner. Nicks, who was coaching 
Sand at the time, heard about Kuchiki and suggested a trial partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Sand and Kuchiki weren't strangers. Over the years, they had run into one 
another at various Valley skating rinks. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Natasha and I knew she had wonderful skating ability," Sand said. 
</P>
<P>
But he never imagined that one day he would be skating with her. 
</P>
<P>
"Her age was a question mark in my mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the questions have been answered. Denise even has the theory that the 
match was made in heaven. 
</P>
<P>
"There are just so many coincidences in their lives," she said, pointing out 
that both Todd and Natasha were born at St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank and 
both are Scorpios. Their mothers are Canadian, Aquarians and married to 
foreigners, Natasha's father being Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fate," Denise says. 
</P>
<P>
Denise had expected great things for the pair, but even she was surprised at 
how fast they shot to prominence. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything happened so quickly," she said. "I feel like I'm still dreaming."

JIM MURRAY: GOLF CAN'T BE AS EASY AS HE MAKES IT LOOK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
No one could ever understand why Freddy Couples didn't win four out of every 
six golf tournaments he entered. 
</P>
<P>
He had the perfect build, the perfect temperament and, if not the perfect 
swing, it was close enough. 
</P>
<P>
Golf always seemed to be kind of a lark to him. Other guys would bite their 
putters, glare at shots, kick their drivers. Freddy never even looked 
perturbed. You'd think he was playing for a $2 Nassau instead of $180,000 first 
money. 
</P>
<P>
The pros called him "Boom Boom" because his tee shots didn't just fly the 
course, they orbited it. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Couples took the Riviera course at the Nissan L.A. Open Saturday and shook 
it like a dog shakes a rag doll. He went after it like a fighter whose man is 
on the ropes glassy-eyed and bleeding. It was caveman golf. Not for the 
squeamish. 
</P>
<P>
Ten birdies in 18 holes is not golf, it's Murder One. A mugging. If it was a 
fight, they would have stopped it. 
</P>
<P>
Riviera was as defenseless as the Denver Broncos. Not a breath of wind coursed 
its fairways and greens. It was like playing in a vacuum. Or on a pool table. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions were so idyllic, even Couples' record-tying 62 could not shake 
the competition out of the tournament. Birdies and eagles flew like confetti at 
a country wedding. The course was so vulnerable, Couples never bothered to jab 
with it. He threw rights, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
He not only tied the course record, he broke the 54-hole tournament record. His 
62 could have been 59. He had birdie putts on at least four of the eight holes 
he didn't birdie. 
</P>
<P>
It was an awesome display of power golf, but the golf world's only surprise is 
Fred Couples doesn't do that all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"He does that all the time, doesn't he?" was rival Rocco Mediate's reaction 
when told Couples had logged in with a 62. Locker room opinion has it Fred 
Couples can shoot a 62 any time he really puts his mind to it. 
</P>
<P>
There's the rub. Prevailing notion also has it Fred Couples is a kind of 
apple-cheeked, raven-haired kid brother on the tour whose attention seems to 
wander from time to time. He doesn't seem to see anything particularly 
difficult about hitting the golf ball. 
</P>
<P>
That may be just his trouble. You tell people who have seen him play, who have 
tracked his mammoth drives, crisp irons and un-yipped putts that he's won only 
three tournaments and they look at you as if your are putting them on. "Come 
on! With that swing?!" 
</P>
<P>
If the game comes to you as easily as it does to Fred Couples, you're supposed 
to be in double-figures in tournaments won and taking dead aim on Hogan's or 
Nicklaus' major-tournament totals. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Couples seems to give the impression he's able to go out there and shoot 
62 without ever really putting his mind to it. "If Ben Hogan could caddy for 
him, he'd never lose," goes the refrain. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally the mind seems to leave the body with Fred. He will hit a good 
shot, but to the wrong place. He's like a guy who loses a pot with four aces. 
</P>
<P>
The notion is, if Freddy just cared more he could be the next Arnold Palmer. 
But Freddy sometimes lets the golf course off the hook. Fred won $693,944 last 
year without winning a tournament. In fact, he's won $1,183,706 since winning a 
tournament. The feeling on the tour is, Freddy takes too many pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Freddy thinks it's a bum rap. "People yell at me to smile, to charge. I know 
they'll expect me to shoot 62 again tomorrow, but that's not realistic. I might 
shoot 75. I make bogeys." 
</P>
<P>
If Tom Kite makes a bogey, they blame the wind, the weather, a noise in the 
gallery, the lie or the fact a hole is laid out wrong for his game. When Fred 
Couples makes a bogey, they blame Fred Couples. His game should be bogey-free. 
The only thing wrong with Fred Couples' swing, they tell you, is that it comes 
attached to Fred Couples. Fred has to get mean, get mad. Golf shouldn't be fun, 
it should be torture. An afternoon in a dungeon. 
</P>
<P>
It's not likely Fred Couples will wake up screaming. Or be noticeably nervous 
on the first tee at the final round. Freddy won't walk out there as if he were 
going to the electric chair. He'll walk out there as if he were going to 10 
more birdies, maybe a 61 this time. 
</P>
<P>
One thing is sure: Freddy won't choke. Freddy doesn't hit a bad shot because he 
suddenly can't swallow. If Freddy hits a bad shot, it's because he over-clubbed 
or under-studied, not because the course -- or the shot -- scared him. They 
don't make that course. 
</P>
<P>
No one has ever shot back-to-back 62s in this -- or any other -- tournament. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone can do it, Fred Couples can.

</P>
<P>
LAWMAKING: COLLEAGUES SAY ASSEMBLYWOMAN DORIS ALLEN HAS GONE OVERBOARD IN 
BATTLING FOR BAN. THE CYPRESS REPUBLICAN DOESN'T TAKE THE BAIT; SHE'S CASTING 
HER LINE TO STATE VOTERS INSTEAD. 
</P>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nowadays, when Assemblywoman Doris Allen gets going about her latest cause, 
some colleagues roll their eyes or mutter under their breath. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a fellow legislator went further. "Doris, you can be your own worst 
enemy," he snapped during a committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Let them rail. Allen won't give up. 
</P>
<P>
"I have passion for issues," she said. "I don't think most people up here even 
know me. They don't know me, inside. They don't know how I feel, they don't 
know what makes me tick." 
</P>
<P>
Allen's latest passion is not abortion, AIDS or Orange County oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
The Cypress Republican is on the soapbox over gill nets. 
</P>
<P>
She has taken on the formidable commercial fishing industry by calling for the 
ban of gill nets in near coastal waters ranging from Point Conception to the 
Mexican border. Not only are the highly efficient, thin-filament nets "strip 
mining" the sea of halibut and other fish stock, she claims, but they are 
indiscriminately killing whales, sea lions and porpoises. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Allen's impassioned pleas for a blanket ban of the nets has yielded 
little more than ill will and glazed eyes at the state Capitol. Now she has 
decided to sidestep the Legislature and take her cause directly to the people 
with a campaign to put an anti-gill net initiative on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Her high-profile efforts have immersed her in a long-running feud between the 
people who fish for a living and those who do it for sport, an unlikely spot 
for an elected representative from a landlocked district. 
</P>
<P>
But Allen contends that her worries about halibut, whales, porpoises and sea 
lions is a matter of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very personal with me," she said in an interview, during which her voice 
cracked with emotion and her eyes welled tears. "That's what I told my staff 
last night. Very personal. Because of the animals. 
</P>
<P>
"If I stop doing this, who's going to do it? Tell me. If I walk away right now, 
who's going to do it?" 
</P>
<P>
Some legislators, however, say that Allen's Joan of Arc role hasn't played well 
under the Capitol dome, where compromise and collegiality are highly prized. 
</P>
<P>
"The shrill nature in which she has raised her voice has unfortunately turned 
people off," said Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno), who, as chairman of the 
Assembly's Water, Parks and Wildlife Committee, has crossed swords with the 
Orange County Republican. "She's made herself one of the least effective 
members of the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
Before this got so nasty, Allen, 53, was just an obscure Orange County 
Republican toiling in a Democratic-controlled Assembly. She is a veteran 
anti-busing foe and an advocate of vocational education, state funding for 
school districts and a law requiring young motorcycle passengers to wear 
helmets -- an idea she touted while holding an outdoor press conference astride 
a motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
Insiders claim she alienated her own party leaders soon after her 1982 
election, when two Republican assemblymen drove to her Orange County office to 
talk caucus politics and were forced to wait 45 minutes, say insiders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One That Got Away 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Allen began to turn over rocks when she was made vice chairman of 
Costa's committee, an assignment she sought because of her interest in Southern 
California water issues. 
</P>
<P>
Her attention shifted to the state Fish and Game Department, a natural interest 
considering that Allen is an accomplished equestrian reared in rural Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
She began looking into the department in earnest at the request of a 
constituent, who sent her a newspaper clipping about the department's inability 
to collect proceeds from outlets that sold fish and game licenses. She dashed 
off several letters, including one she called her "nuclear bomb" containing 125 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
Ignored by the department, Allen decided to go straight to Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco) for help. Brown promptly arranged to have the department's 
budget held hostage in the Legislature until administrators gave Allen what she 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
It did -- in boxes of voluminous computer printouts. The undaunted Allen hired 
a consultant to sort through the material while she pressed for legislation for 
an official audit of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
The results, published in a November, 1985, auditor general's report, showed 
that Fish and Game had been woefully inept. Its poor administrative practices 
had left $1.2 million in hunting and fishing license revenue uncollected since 
1980. The agency also had failed to collect $1.6 million in taxes from the 
commercial fishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
But Allen's victory didn't last long. Instead of having the agency collect the 
money, the Legislature, prompted by panic from commercial fishers, passed a 
bill to forgive the back taxes -- a measure Allen tried frantically to stop. 
</P>
<P>
It was an awesome display of political power by a trade group that pays $60,000 
a year for a full-time lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Capitol, Allen found there was one group that sympathized -- the 
hundreds of thousands of California sportfishermen who have nothing good to say 
about their commercial cousins. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a group that has a very focused interest and they're die-hard," said 
Kenneth Kukuda, who writes for South Coast Sportfishing, a Santa Ana-based 
magazine with a circulation of 45,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always said that if you take 20 of my readers and 20 commercial fishermen 
and we have a rumble in a parking lot, I have no problem about who is going to 
win that one," said Kukuda. 
</P>
<P>
The enmity has always run high between the commercials and the recreationals. 
The ill will has been particularly acute in the last decade over what 
sportfishermen believe to be the dwindling number of halibut off California 
shores. 
</P>
<P>
The main culprit, they say, is the gill net, a thin-filament mesh weighted down 
and unfurled under the water like a tennis net. Put out overnight, the nets -- 
which are as long as 6,000 feet -- use dark panels to trap the fish, which 
suffocate when they are trapped by the gills. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the nets are also responsible for "incidental" kills of other marine life, 
such as sea lions, sea otters, harbor porpoises, gray whales and sea birds. The 
most recent California estimates show the nets kill nearly 3,500 sea lions, 
1,900 harbor seals, 300 harbor porpoises and at least several gray whales each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The deaths of these animals, some of which are endangered or threatened 
species, has spawned 24 laws since 1980 closing all of the Northern California 
near-shore waters and selected portions of the central coast to gill net 
fishing. 
</P>
<P>
But sportfishermen want to extend the ban to Southern California, where 
bureaucrats and some marine preservationists maintain the threat of incidental 
kills to endangered species is small despite scenes like those on Orange County 
beaches last year, when more than 50 dead sea lions washed ashore in a 
three-week period, apparently killed by gill nets. 
</P>
<P>
The sportfishermen's legislative ally is Allen, who crossed paths with Kukuda 
in late 1986 during her continuing fight against the Fish and Game Department. 
Eventually, Allen agreed to write a bill that would prohibit gill net fishing 
within three miles of Southern California shores. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial fishermen figured she was proposing the ban on behalf of the 
wealthy. "What she wants is to make the near-shore waters of California a 
private sports-fishing lake for her favorite constituents," said Craig Ghio, 
vice president of Ghio Seafood Products in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Ghio and other commercial fishermen and seafood processors say the gill net ban 
would cause economic havoc in their industry. The 482 gill netters in Southern 
California catch about 20 million pounds of fish a year, compared to 250 
million pounds caught throughout the state with other kinds of nets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sierra Club Won't Bite 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the traditional environmentalists have been noticeably cool to 
Allen, who despite her gill net battle received low marks last year from the 
California League of Conservation Voters. Paula M. Carrell, lobbyist for the 
Sierra Club, said her group hasn't joined Allen because it views the battle 
over gill nets as a war between the fishermen, not an environmentally inspired 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically a competition of who gets their hook in the water first," said 
Carrell. "My feeling is that the sports fishermen are hiding behind the marine 
mammal issue." 
</P>
<P>
Allen makes no secret of her support from sportfishermen, and has even worked 
hard to cultivate them. She formed a marine advisory committee that consisted 
of outdoors journalists such as Kukuda, who spread the word to hundreds of 
hunting and fishing clubs throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
"She has stepped in at the right time and has been very instrumental in 
organizing all the groups," Kukuda said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Orange County legislator says she's pushing for a ban because, despite 
assertions to the contrary, she is convinced that gill nets are a threat to 
marine mammals living off Southern California shores. "I'm doing this for the 
whales," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And she downplays talk of economic tragedy, saying only 2% of the fish sold in 
California is caught in Southern California gill nets. 
</P>
<P>
When Allen's legislation first came up for a hearing last April, she 
underscored her concern for whales and other sea creatures by bringing to 
Costa's committee the Hollywood actress who played the role of a marine 
biologist in "Star Trek IV." And in her own remarks, the lawmaker refers to 
incidental kills as "tragic" deaths and "carnage." 
</P>
<P>
Even though her tactics have angered some of her colleagues, Costa agreed last 
April to hold an even more in-depth meeting on the subject and suggested that 
the committee convene an interim session in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
A November date was picked. "We had several thousand sportsmen, 
conservationists, environmentalists going to attend the hearing," said Allen. 
"They thought that everything was hinging on this hearing." 
</P>
<P>
But, abruptly, the hearing was canceled. Costa informed Allen that, among other 
things, the committee didn't have money for the trip and most of her colleagues 
simply refused to show up. 
</P>
<P>
That decision led to an exchange of bitter letters between Allen and Costa, who 
was attacked in the sports fishing press as a "two-bit" politician and the 
equivalent to deposed Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 9, Costa's committee considered Allen's proposed ban one last time 
during a Capitol committee meeting. Still fuming, she refused to consider any 
weakening amendments, drawing the stinging public rebuke from Assemblyman Steve 
Peace (D-La Mesa). Costa said that when Allen began her remarks, some of his 
committee members rolled their eyes and muttered, "Do we have to listen to this 
again?" 
</P>
<P>
They did -- and then quickly killed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Allen and her allies are quick to point out the curious way the bill was 
allowed to die. No one actually voted against the measure, but instead decided 
to abstain, so there were not enough aye votes to pass it out of committee. 
</P>
<P>
Of the seven members who declined to vote, five received a total of $2,932 in 
political donations last year from the commercial fishing lobby, public records 
show. That includes a $1,000 donation to Costa. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's action, along with the political contributions and the snub she 
received in November, led Allen to take the gill net issue out of the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Costa did more to bring about an initiative than anything I could do," 
Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative effort is the third time sportfishermen have tried to get a 
ballot measure against gill nets. The previous two attempts, sponsored by 
Kukuda, have failed to garner enough signatures for consideration on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But with Allen's support, there is hope this time, they say. So far, the 
legislator has helped to gather more than 300,000 signatures and raise 
$175,000. The goal: to collect more than 950,000 valid signatures by May 6. 
</P>
<P>
And, not so incidentally, the initiative campaign has given the Orange County 
lawmaker a new statewide political base and excellent exposure. On Friday, for 
example, she was featured on radio talk shows in Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
A Lot of Fight Left 
</P>
<P>
In her wake, she leaves colleagues angered by a determination that they 
describe as being close to obsession. "The sad fact is that Doris, I think, is 
very narrow-minded and extremely petty and tends to take every difference of 
opinion by her colleagues as a personal affront, which they are not intended to 
be," Costa said. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said she doesn't care how unpopular she's become with fellow legislators. 
</P>
<P>
"Call her hysterical -- that's a nice, chauvinistic thing to say," Allen said. 
"Call her shrill. Call her a woman from Cypress who doesn't know what she's 
talking about. Why would she care about this issue? 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to say, 'Why wouldn't I?' I care about this issue and I'm 
tenacious."

Johnnie Ray, the balladeer of tears who brought an emotional intensity to music 
that was singular to his era, died Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The performer, once dubbed "The Prince of Wails" for his impassioned renditions 
of such songs as "Cry" and "Please Mr. Sun," was 63 and died of liver failure 
at 4 p.m., Cedars-Sinai spokesman Ron Wise said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been in and out of the hospital for the last three months" and lapsed 
into a coma Feb. 14, Wise said. 
</P>
<P>
Ray, noted for his stormy style, would jump about as he sang, bend his knees 
and cup his hand to his left ear, where a hearing aid had been in place for 
many years. He injured the ear while being tossed in the air by friends when he 
was 10, and his hearing deteriorated through the years. Many said, not 
unkindly, that he sang as if everyone in the room had similar hearing problems. 
</P>
<P>
As he sang, he contorted his babyish face into a painful expression, tugged at 
his hair and cried. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, his first hit in 1950 was called "Cry." The other side of that 
record was "The Little White Cloud That Cried." They quickly became the No. 1 
and No. 2 songs in the country, turning an awkward, shy boy into a national 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Times rock critic Robert Hilburn wrote that Ray had played a 
"small but noteworthy role in the evolution of rock," helping pave the way for 
the passionate singers that followed him. 
</P>
<P>
His roots actually were in rhythm and blues, for his flamboyant style had 
forced him away from mainstream nightclubs and in front of black audiences at 
the Flame Showbar in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
He soon became the only white artist on Okeh Records' black R&amp;B roster. 
</P>
<P>
(Music critics have said the intensity of his early vocals helped open the door 
for Elvis Presley and other white rock artists.) 
</P>
<P>
After those instant successes he moved into the mainstream of singers and lost 
favor with the teen-agers who had mobbed him at personal appearances in the 
early 1950s. But he was never forgotten by the white rockers who followed him. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last year he shared a stage with Billy Idol. And Billy Joel, who 
opened last week's Grammy Awards telecast, sang "We Didn't Start the Fire," a 
song of appreciation for long-ago performers that names Ray in the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
Although young record buyers had largely ignored him for the last three 
decades, their parents hadn't. He appeared regularly in New York, Las Vegas and 
Atlantic City, singing the evergreen favorites that had put him on the national 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
Born John Alvin Ray in Dallas, Ore., a small town outside Salem (where he made 
his last public appearance), Ray was the son of a man who played fiddle at 
square dances and a woman proficient on the piano. He became a self-taught 
pianist who sang at church and at school. 
</P>
<P>
Initially an outgoing child, friends recall that after his hearing loss he 
became introverted and his teachers and others chastised him for not paying 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the loneliest kid in the world," he was quoted as saying. From that 
loneliness came "The Little White Cloud That Cried," which he wrote in his 
teens. 
</P>
<P>
But after he was fitted with a hearing aid at 15, his horizons expanded and he 
decided to become an actor, performing in local plays and amateur shows. 
</P>
<P>
He met Sophie Tucker, the raucous and lightly ribald singer, as she was passing 
through Portland where Ray was singing at a burlesque house. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to make it in show business," she told him, "get the hell out of 
Portland." 
</P>
<P>
He came to Hollywood in 1949 to act in films but found only odd jobs as a 
bartender and piano player in clubs he described as "upholstered sewers." 
</P>
<P>
He went to New York and then to Detroit, where he found work at the Flame 
Showbar. A local disc jockey persuaded a Columbia Records representative to 
give him a chance and the result was "Whiskey and Gin" and "Tell the Lady I 
Said Goodbye" for Okeh, a Columbia subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Those songs became popular in the Midwest, but it wasn't until he returned to 
New York to record "Cry" and "Little White Cloud" that he became fully 
established. 
</P>
<P>
He followed those hits with "Please Mr. Sun" and "Brokenhearted," arranged by 
Mitch Miller. All four became million-sellers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1952 he opened at the Copacabana in New York and the standing-room-only 
crowds (and press agents) began to call him "The Prince of Wails," "The Nabob 
of Sob" and "The Atomic Ray," among other sobriquets. 
</P>
<P>
He became the first performer to earn $25,000 a week in Las Vegas and on March 
23, 1953, made the first of nine appearances at the London Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
The following year he came back to Hollywood to make the film debut he had 
sought earlier. He appeared as the son of Ethel Merman and Dan Dailey in the 
Irving Berlin musical "There's No Business Like Show Business." 
</P>
<P>
But records were his forte and he returned to the studio. In the next five 
years he made hits of "Just Walking in the Rain," "Walking My Baby Back Home," 
"Yes Tonight, Josephine," "Hernando's Hideaway," "Such a Night," "Somebody 
Stole My Gal" and more. 
</P>
<P>
"Cry," his original hit, had sold 25 million copies at his death and Columbia 
recently released a compact disc of his many hit singles. 
</P>
<P>
He married once, in 1952, to Marilyn Morrison, daughter of Mocambo nightclub 
owner Charlie Morrison, but they divorced. He is survived by a sister and 
nieces and nephews. 
</P>
<P>
His personal life was sometimes as pained as his music. He developed a drinking 
problem, he told The Times in 1976, but indicated he had conquered it. 
</P>
<P>
Ray credited his success with "showing people the emotion they're afraid to 
show" and also said he had grown more appreciative of his career over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, in Salem at what proved to be his final appearance, he told his 
audience: 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't get any better than this."
