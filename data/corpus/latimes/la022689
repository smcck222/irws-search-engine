THE FICTION OF THITHER AND YON; 
</P>
<P>
HENCE BY BRAD LEITHAUSER (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $18.95; 320 PP.; 0-394-57311-0) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Bradfield, Bradfield's first novel, The History of Luminous Motion, 
will be published in September by Alfred A. Knopf.

<TEXT>
<P>
Brad Leithauser's second novel doesn't concern the future so much as the 
impossibility of ever comprehending what our future may hold. As Garner Briggs, 
the hypothetical author of "Hence" argues, we never completely understand 
anything -- the future, people, lives or events; we only invent stories about 
them. By learning to distrust the fictional worlds we inhabit -- America, say, 
Truth or Justice -- we can free our imagination to wander hence, into new and 
uncharted territories that are vaster and more meaningful than any mere story. 
</P>
<P>
"Hence" presents itself as a book within a book, giving us plenty of reasons to 
distrust it. Equipped with its own title page, epigraphs and retrospective 
introduction, "Hence: A Meditation in Voices" by Garner Briggs, does not 
pretend to be a story or autobiography so much as a sort of philosophical 
reminiscence. Set in the late 20th Century, it is being reprinted by a 
"renegade aesthetician" somewhere deep in the 21st. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs, a professor of law, examines the story of his brother, Timothy, a 
21-year-old junior chess master lured into a highly publicized tournament with 
ANNDY, a formidable computer manufactured by America's premier and 
irreproachable Congam Corp. Garner considers Timothy's contest a parable of men 
confronted by the machinery they create -- machinery that includes the 
mechanical images and high-tech fictions of television and magazines. As public 
interest in the tournament increases, Timothy feels more and more entrapped by 
his quickly media-fied role as a sort of postmodern John Henry. He becomes 
lionized; someone even offers to compose his theme song. 
</P>
<P>
Garner, a legal theorist worried by the way laws define imaginary human 
"norms," fears that the entire world is becoming like his deceased father's 
fact-filled notebooks, monuments to what Garner refers to as "the tyrannous, 
benighting, stultifying effect of a methodical mental consistency." Garner 
wants to tell his story instead "with an irregular consistency, which is to 
say, an inconsistent consistency, which is to say, with that unflinching 
comprehensiveness accessible only to paradox." 
</P>
<P>
Deliberately, then, Garner steadfastly refuses to tell a story with a 
beginning, middle and end. He does not want to present data; he wants to 
complicate it. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy's confrontation with ANNDY, his strange affinities for his dead twin 
brother, Tommy, and the ominous unyielding world of corporations and media all 
make for a set of intriguing narrative premises; unfortunately, however, these 
premises are methodically disregarded as the novel develops (or, perhaps more 
accurately, as it refuses to develop). What begins as a compelling read turns 
aimless, cloudy and abstract. Timothy abandons his beautiful publicist, Vicky, 
after a bungled seduction in order to return to his hometown and resume a 
mindless courtship with his placid, cowlike childhood sweetheart; he buries 
himself in the routine, customized meals and schedules of Congam's Totaplex 
Hotel, until his rather anxious claim that he is the "human being" in the 
tournament begins to sound grimly ironic; he develops a sudden passion for the 
self-lacerating televangelist, Reverend Rabbit (a man obsessed, like Garner and 
Timothy, with the world's lies and deceptive surfaces). The progress and 
outcome of Timothy's match with ANNDY is eventually disregarded altogether 
(becoming referred to only as something our hypothetical future readers already 
"know"), and even Garner's controlling narrative voice quickly diffuses and 
fades away. One begins to feel that even the narrator has lost interest in his 
own paradoxical anti-narrative. 
</P>
<P>
Deprived of any sense of narrative urgency, the central and concluding chapters 
of Leithauser's novel inflate with almost endless, blithe chatter: people 
ordering dinner, perusing shopping malls, and endlessly wandering the 
glittering soundless corridors of the Totaplex Hotel. The book degenerates into 
an exasperating montage of observational bits and conversational asides, as 
mundane and trivial as the notebooks of Garner's father. Eventually, in this 
book concerned with the problems of men and machines, the reader begins to 
wonder what is more mechanical: the machinery of plot, or the machinery of 
Leithauser's critical method. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of this novel, the reader has forgotten to care anymore, since the 
people he cares about have all grown unfocused and uninteresting. The various 
family and interpersonal relationships never yield any emotional stuff: Nobody 
ever realizes anything, or does anything, or feels anything. Like the, by now, 
rather careworn and conventional School of Fictionality -- Barth, Calvino, Lem, 
Gass -- Leithauser takes deliberate pains to say something about the 
relationships between fiction and our world, but he has neglected to write 
absorbing fiction in the meantime. It is one thing to argue that our world has 
grown disaffected, mechanical and sad; it is another to write a disaffected and 
mechanical book about it. Despite all his talent, Leithauser, like many 
literary academics (or even like many writers of conventional science fiction) 
displays more concern for his theories in "Hence" than he does for his people.

A LIFE AFTER DEATH;

<P>
FIVE SEASONS A NOVEL BY A. B. YEHOSHUA; TRANSLATED FROM THE HEBREW BY HILLEL

<P>
By Aram Saroyan, Saroyan's new novel is The Romantic (McGraw-Hill). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Molko, the protagonist of A. B. Yehoshua's "Five Seasons," is a 50-year-old 
accountant in Israel's Ministry of the Interior in Haifa who has watched his 
wife die of cancer after a long, unrelieved struggle. Because his life has been 
centered in the sick room for the better part of a decade, his wife's death is, 
inevitably, a release, but Molko is like a trout put back into the water after 
being hooked. Before swimming again, he remains immobile for a while, breathing 
in and breathing out his old element, as if trying to recover a long lost 
impulse. 
</P>
<P>
So begins this extraordinary novel which tracks -- in a fluent, highly 
intimate, third-person narrative -- the year in Molko's life that follows his 
beloved wife's passing. The father of three children, all of them grown but the 
last (a sulky high school boy who is close to being left back a grade), his 
daily round includes his apartment and his job; the old people's home where his 
mother-in-law (a delightfully lucid German Jew in her 80s) resides; and an 
occasional visit to his mother in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his late wife, Molko has roots in Israel going back five generations in 
his Sephardi family. Passive, a little overweight, a compulsive penny-counter 
not above small irritations, and an innocent before getting married 30 years 
earlier, he is a perfect, permeable center for a novel that begins in a dark 
room and, as Molko gains confidence and autonomy, goes on to explore Paris, 
West Germany, the Galilee Heights, Jerusalem, and even, in a second trip to 
Germany, crosses the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, there is much memorable evocation of land and cityscape and 
attendant weather of all varieties; of opera, Tolstoy, and, most important, a 
number of women. Of the latter, an old crush of Molko's Jerusalem boyhood, a 
beauty who went off with a charismatic truth-seeker, and who at 50 is sadly 
childless and still unformed, is, along with Molko's polar-opposite 
mother-in-law, an unforgettable portrait. 
</P>
<P>
What is the central pleasure of a good novel? Jack Kerouac, who could claim at 
least one classic ("On the Road") for his authority on the subject, said it was 
good companionship. By this standard, among others, "Five Seasons" is as 
satisfying and rewarding a novel as I've encountered in a long time. Here is 
Molko with his old crush, the tall Ya'ara who refuses to wear makeup and now 
has a little pot belly that makes her resemble a question mark. Molko has 
driven her to a settlement in Yodfat so she can visit the house she once lived 
in with her truth-seeker, Molko's boyhood camp counselor. Standing on some 
crates, Ya'ara peers in a window at the house, the scene of at least one of her 
miscarriages and a long convalescence: 
</P>
<P>
" 'But why not go inside?' he suggested. She threw him a grateful look, stepped 
down from the crates, circled the house to a locked door, and groped for a 
rusty key above the lintel. With a squeak, it turned in the lock. Pushing the 
door open with her little belly, she stepped unhesitatingly inside. Molko 
remained in the doorway, peering curiously into the house, which looked 
surprisingly tidy, with its plain furniture, straw mats, and shelves full of 
books and clay figurines. Who last had lived here? he wondered. Had they had 
children? Ya'ara stood looking around her, tall against the low ceiling. She 
looks best in this gray light, he thought as she led him to her old room, 
though I'll never know her if I don't make love to her. If she would only cry 
now, it would melt me so fast that sex would be no problem. Yet, though he 
waited patiently, she did not. Eagerly she prowled about the room, handling 
things, forgetting she was not in her own house, even opening an old closet as 
if hoping to find her dead babies there." 
</P>
<P>
The beautifully observed, transparent tenderness of this passage is one of the 
hallmarks of "Five Seasons," along with virtually hundreds of small felicities 
in the prose of Hillel Halkin's fine translation. The five seasons provide the 
book's primary divisions, from one "Autumn" through the next one. Within these 
major sections, there are frequent numbered divisions, which serve to ventilate 
and pace the narrative. 
</P>
<P>
T. S. Eliot once remarked admiringly of Henry James that he had a mind so fine 
that it was unblemished by even a single idea. He was speaking, I think, of the 
novelist as literature's supreme expositor of the fullest possible 
moment-to-moment play of the human being, in which ideas per se can only be 
another element, not a ruling design. In an age of meta-fiction, super-realism, 
and all the other current strategies, Yehoshua, in his third novel, with its 
shy, unassuming protagonist, has returned us to such a standard. In the opinion 
of one grateful reader, he has written a masterpiece.

REFLECTIONS ON A RICH RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ISLANDS VIA THE SEA

<TEXT>
<P>
WHEN YOU READ this, my wife and I should be on a cruise to Hawaii, with stops 
in Maui, Oahu and the Big Island of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the first cruise I have taken since 1966, when we took a French 
freighter to Vancouver, and my first ocean-liner cruise to Hawaii since 1941, 
before Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
I am glad to see the revival of the cruise ship. Today, though, it is merely a 
seagoing carnival. 
</P>
<P>
In 1941, the oceangoing liner was the main means of transportation between land 
masses separated by water, and the train was the main means overland. 
</P>
<P>
There was a grandeur about sea and train travel. One traveled in a time warp. 
Progress was too gradual to produce jet lag. One had time to really separate 
himself from his usual routines of night and day, work and sleep. 
</P>
<P>
There was little or no anxiety about an accident. Trains were sometimes 
derailed; ships hit icebergs. But the likelihood of such mishaps occurring was 
too slight to be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
And when one reached a destination, it was not overrun by tens of thousands of 
other tourists who had flown in by jet. When the Lurline docked in Honolulu, 
the Matsonia would be departing with all the passengers it had brought. Only 
the Lurline's passengers would be in town. 
</P>
<P>
A band would be playing "Aloha Oe" on the dock. Native Hawaiian girls (oh, they 
might be Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese or Samoan) would be hula-dancing in 
grass skirts. When you disembarked, they would throw flower leis around your 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
I have made four round-trip cruises to Hawaii. The first two were when I was a 
scullion on the S. S. Monterey, a sister ship of the Lurline. We sailed first 
to Honolulu, then on to Pago Pago, Suva, Auckland, Sydney and Melbourne. Then, 
we returned by the same route in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
I will never forget that first day in Honolulu. I was on deck to see the 
landfall. Diamond Head was lit by the early sun. 
</P>
<P>
We rounded it and there was Waikiki. The long waves rolled slowly up to the 
white beach. Two hotels, the pink Royal Hawaiian and the gray Moana, rose 
beyond Waikiki amid the palm trees. In the background, purple mountaintops were 
crowned by rain clouds. 
</P>
<P>
We docked downtown, and I rode a trolley to the beach, my swimming trunks under 
my pants. At Waikiki, I swam far out, beyond the farthest waves. I turned 
around in the warm water, looking back over the surf toward the gorgeous 
backdrop. I promised myself that someday I would come back to stay. 
</P>
<P>
I tried it two years later. I saved enough money to buy a cabin-class ticket on 
the Lurline for $110. I was on the beach in Honolulu. I hocked two German 
cameras to live. I hoped to get a job on the Advertiser on the basis of my year 
and a half as the Bakersfield Californian's sportswriter. That wasn't enough 
for the managing editor, but sports editor Red McQueen paid me $15 a week out 
of his pocket to work for him. After three months, I got discouraged and wired 
my father for the fare home. 
</P>
<P>
In early 1941 I tried again, leaving my new wife behind. On shipboard, I struck 
up an acquaintance with two attractive young women who seemed to be traveling 
together. They turned out to be prostitutes on their way back to their jobs in 
Honolulu. We became inseparable. We talked at the rail with studied 
sophistication, looking out over the sea. We danced. We drank. Sex was taboo. 
After all, they were on holiday. They were ladies; I was their gentleman 
friend. We were enchanted. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, after my wife had joined me in Honolulu, we were walking 
down Hotel Street one day when I saw one of those women approaching us on the 
sidewalk. As she drew near, I smiled and said, "Hello!" with unfeigned delight. 
Eyes straight ahead, she passed us by. I realized that she didn't want my wife 
to know about us, but I felt betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
Late in 1942, we sailed home on a small freighter, never knowing whether it 
might be torpedoed. 
</P>
<P>
My last voyage to Hawaii was in 1943 -- on a small aircraft carrier. 
</P>
<P>
I'm hoping that this cruise to the islands will be more carefree.

<P>
The 1980s will be remembered much longer as the decade of AIDS -- the acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome -- than as that of Ronald Reagan. AIDS has had a 
pervasive effect upon society, transforming the eros of human relationships 
into a flirtation with death in a way that has hardly been known since syphilis 
rampaged across Europe as a fatal illness nearly 500 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The notion that love is uncompromisingly joyous usually has faced challenges. 
Venereal diseases were difficult to eradicate until the introduction of 
antibiotics in the 1940s. Pregnancy was a serious, life-transforming (and 
occasionally fatal) consequence of sexual intercourse, even when mechanical 
means of contraception became available. It was in the 1950s, however, with the 
introduction of birth control pills, that pregnancy prevention became nearly 
fool-proof. The legalization of abortion a few years later was but the final 
stage in this process. Sexual mores had been inhibited, very likely as a 
pragmatic response to the problems of infection and pregnancy, but by the late 
1960s eroticism was flowing freely. 
</P>
<P>
"Make love, not war" was a popular slogan of those who wished to contrast the 
affirmation of life with the propagation of death. It was not surprising that 
homosexuals, too, sought to liberate their sexuality from the prejudices and 
formal restraints with which it had contended for so long. The 1970s was the 
first and last decade of innocence in the sexual Garden of Eden of our time. 
Sexuality was to be celebrated by all, free of legal recrimination (at least in 
some jurisdictions), of disease and of inevitable pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS changed all that, in ways that are only now permeating the heterosexual 
community. Sex became a risky enterprise, and the risks extended well beyond 
the occasional brief episode of an uncomfortable herpetic rash. Sex became a 
chance to die. Perhaps more ominously, it became a chance to kill. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Bayer's fine book, "Private Acts, Social Consequences: AIDS and the 
Politics of Public Health" is an important and compelling document of the 
transformation of eros by AIDS and of the ways in which government agencies and 
various interest groups have responded to this unwanted development. Bayer, who 
teaches at Columbia University, chaired the first national project to study the 
ethical and social challenges posed by AIDS. Writing in an engaging narrative 
style, he explores a series of issues that have aroused communities, 
preoccupied public health officials and been exploited by politicians. 
</P>
<P>
When John Snow demonstrated a century ago that cholera was caused by water 
coming from a well in London, he removed the handle from the pump and the 
epidemic was ended. Much public discourse on AIDS has been a search for that 
pump handle. Perhaps the most interesting chapter in the book is one on the 
campaigns to close bathhouses frequented by gay men in order to deter 
propagation of the disease. In San Francisco, after some vacillation, public 
health officials ultimately won court approval to regulate high risk behavior 
in the baths. In so doing, they had to endure protracted battles with the 
owners of the establishments and with civil libertarians, who were concerned 
that any effort to forbid unsafe sexual acts ultimately would be extended to 
private homes and, eventually, to all homosexual relations. In New York City, 
public health officials were very reluctant to compromise the right to privacy. 
Ironically, in their ultimate effort to close some of the baths, they sent in 
inspectors, who witnessed nearly 50 episodes of high risk oral or anal sex. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout these debates, gay civil rights groups and advocacy groups seemed 
conflicted. On the one hand, they wanted to defend the gains in the right to 
privacy and sexual acceptance that had been achieved. On the other hand, the 
people being exposed to the virus in these establishments were other gay men. 
In most cities, no action was taken against bathhouses which did not limit high 
risk sex. Bayer argues that public health officials moved unevenly against the 
bathhouses because of political constraints of needing cooperation with the gay 
community, the liberal political cultures in the cities most heavily infected 
and the recognition that bathhouses were only a small part of the problem. He 
contends that it was a misjudgement not to act more decisively, because as a 
symbolic act, the closure would have sent a resounding message to the community 
about the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Bayer reminds his readers of the now-forgotten battles about testing the blood 
supply and discouraging high risk individuals from donating. The concerns about 
the invasion of privacy and about the possibility of a list of infected 
individuals that might fall into government hands were once again pervasive. 
Other problems addressed by the book include testing various groups or the 
population as a whole for antibodies to the AIDS virus, the degree of 
confidentiality to be associated with testing and the occasional suggestions 
that infected individuals be quarantined. These are issues that have captured 
the interest of the political world in a way unlike that of any recent health 
problem other than the Swine Flu. Last year, the various presidential 
candidates had far more to say about AIDS testing than about their plans for 
reducing the deficit. California voters have had to declare their position on 
AIDS almost as frequently as George Steinbrenner fires a manager. Throughout 
the debate on these issues, there was consistently an intense concern about 
privacy held by gay groups, a desire to act in intrusive and hostile ways on 
the part of those who were anti-gay, and a lack of data available to support 
any position. 
</P>
<P>
What Bayer demonstrates best of all is that health care is not just science. It 
is intrinsically linked to the social and political process. He raises the 
question about whether the current measures to contain the epidemic are 
optimal, noting that the level on which health bureaucrats have settled their 
efforts has been that which their constituencies were willing to accept. 
</P>
<P>
"AIDS Inc.: Scandal of the Century" is another recent book that manifests the 
transformation that a virus has wrought. Jon Rappaport taps into the desire of 
many to return to a pre-AIDS world, where life was simpler and sexual 
intercourse was not a clinical entity to be encountered in formats prescribed 
according to serostatus. The book is angry, and is contemptuous of the medical 
research and public health establishment. It is also unquestionably wrong in 
its major theses: that human immunodeficiency virus does not cause AIDS, that 
zidovudine (AZT) does not improve the prognosis and that AIDS is not really a 
disease but rather a collection of symptoms caused by a variety of other 
phenomena (sexually transmitted diseases, antibiotics, stress, malnutrition) 
that can be addressed in more naturopathic ways. The evidence for the existence 
of AIDS and for the virus' role in it has been scrutinized by a wide variety of 
virologists and epidemiologists and has been judged to be sound. The drug 
treatment surely can be toxic and is not a cure, but the best available 
evidence is that it does prolong life. This book is a rage against the dying of 
the light that does not sustain its argument with coherent data.

JAMBOREE ROAD IS ONE OF THOSE Orange County boulevards that looks as if it was 
paved yesterday and scrubbed by hand this morning. Its manicured blacktop 
climbs a coastal rise past decorator palm trees and a BMW dealership and drops 
down into the quiet of Newport Beach as neatly as the last line in a song about 
love being the answer. From Jamboree Road, it's not far to where Joseph 
Wambaugh lives, on an island of multimillion-dollar homes that have yacht slips 
in back. Here, surrounded by a harbor full of pleasure boats and the joyful 
noise of ice cubes kissing the sides of cocktail glasses, Wambaugh goes into a 
room, alone, seven days a week and contemplates what terrible things human 
beings are capable of. 
</P>
<P>
Out of such contemplation and the compulsive writing that has accompanied it 
since 1971 have come 11 books about crime and the often anti-heroic foot 
soldiers who battle it somewhere this side of Dirty Harry. Wambaugh, who was a 
cop himself for 14 years with the Los Angeles Police Department, regards dimly 
the action-packed majority of Hollywood's cop movies and refers to them 
generically as "comic books." His taste is for the plausible, the ironic, the 
real, and, definitely, the dark. 
</P>
<P>
Suicidal cops, sociopathic killers, charred corpses, lifeless violated 
teen-agers all inform a world view whose cosmic message is that life is often a 
series of bad accidents waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
His latest book, "The Blooding," is another of his true crime stories and the 
second in a row in which he has left his familiar Southern California locale, 
this time going as far as the placid Midlands of England. In a cluster of 
villages in Leicestershire, where unsolved murders are nearly unknown, he 
tracks the investigation into the rape-slayings of two 15-year-old girls, in 
1983 and 1986. It turned out to be the first murder investigation on record 
that was resolved through the use of the revolutionary new forensic technique 
called "genetic fingerprinting." 
</P>
<P>
This time, the cops are English, and they defer to science when all else fails, 
but one thing remains the same: Wambaugh's fascination with the inner workings 
of the criminal mind. Like his first nonfiction novel, "The Onion Field," and 
his last one, "Echoes in the Darkness," "The Blooding" takes the reader through 
the menacing terrain of the sociopathic killer, where conventional notions of 
good and evil go begging in the night. 
</P>
<P>
What sort of man is drawn so relentlessly to this netherworld of pain and 
degradation? 
</P>
<P>
He is, for one thing, not a man who encourages public exploration of that 
question. Like a lot of writers whose work requires them to sift through the 
secret lives of others, the 52-year-old Wambaugh is wary of anyone's measuring 
the dimensions of his life. He rarely gives in-depth interviews, and his 
publisher and publicist seem to know little about his personal life. 
</P>
<P>
Shy, emotional, prickly, earnest, humble and conscience-worn, Wambaugh is a 
loner who has made his way up from the working class of Southern California to 
become one of the region's most important writers, maybe even its most original 
literary creation: the cop novelist. His richly told tales routinely reach the 
best-seller lists and are taken seriously by respected critics. "I think I've 
gotten better reviews than I deserve," Wambaugh says with typical humility. 
</P>
<P>
His past five books have sold an average of 1.5 million copies each, which is 
short of Sidney Sheldonville (where sales can reach 5 million copies) but 
sufficient to translate into royalties of what one publishing industry source 
roughly estimates at $1 million per book. Wambaugh is adamant about not 
discussing his income other than remarking: "I don't make as much as a mediocre 
ballplayer." 
</P>
<P>
But Wambaugh's popularity as a writer doesn't translate into a life filled with 
people. He doesn't claim to have or need a lot of friends; he doesn't use a 
literary agent, and he even likes to play golf alone. His one intimate 
companion on this unlikely journey has been his wife of 33 years, Dee, who 
still retypes his manuscripts and handles all his finances. They met while 
attending Chaffey High School out on the flats of Ontario and married while he 
was serving in the Marines after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"I am of the proletariat," he once explained proudly. And in all his books, 
Wambaugh has reserved a certain scorn for the trappings of sophistication. Even 
FBI agents who wear three-piece suits are considered questionable. Yet it goes 
without saying that he is possibly one of the few members of the proletariat 
currently living behind the gates of Linda Isle. 
</P>
<P>
The house is a new one, the third he has owned in Newport Beach. The Wambaughs 
move around a lot. Since rising above a burglary detective's salary with the 
publication 18 years ago of his first novel, "The New Centurions," he and Dee 
and their three children have lived in three houses in San Marino, three in 
Newport Beach, one in Indian Wells and one in Rancho Mirage, where he sometimes 
spends the weekends. He attributes the moves simply to "a certain amount of 
restlessness, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the complications of having so many choices available to you," is 
the way Dee puts it. She says a move often proves just the necessary impetus to 
dislodge a new book from her husband's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Good Life but Troubles 
</P>
<P>
BUT LUXURY HOMES ASIDE, the last few years have been sometimes agonizing ones 
for Joseph Aloysius Wambaugh Jr. In 1984, his 21-year-old son, Mark, and a 
companion were killed when their Jeep went out of control and struck two 
oncoming cars on the road from Ensenada to Tijuana. The tragedy made a private 
man even more private. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't talk about that," Wambaugh says when the subject of Mark comes 
up. "Never. I don't even talk about that privately." 
</P>
<P>
Later that same year, he was hit with a libel suit by one of the San Diego 
police officers he wrote about in "Lines and Shadows," his account of the 
short-lived undercover task force that battled Mexican bandits who prey on 
illegal immigrants at the border. (Each of his three nonfiction novels before 
"The Blooding" has attracted at least one lawsuit.) 
</P>
<P>
And "The Blooding" has stirred up more trouble for him, this time in England, 
where the parents of one of the victims, upset about the graphic murder details 
revealed in the book, have complained to authorities. The complaints have led 
to an internal-affairs investigation to determine whether local police 
improperly provided privileged information to Wambaugh. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very, very sad and distressed," he says about this. "This has me so upset, 
I can't tell you. The last thing I ever want to do in the world is get 
policemen in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Wambaugh's empathy for police officers, particularly middle-aged 
officers with the night sweats, stands out as his most distinctive literary 
trait, along with the black humor he says he picked up years ago after reading 
and rereading Joseph Heller's "Catch-22." 
</P>
<P>
It was Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood," however, that showed him the way to 
"The Onion Field," which recounted the murder of a young Los Angeles detective, 
the breakdown of his surviving partner and the tortuous legal march to bring 
the two killers to justice. Wambaugh has wanted to write about real crimes and 
real people ever since, despite the creative restrictions of nonfiction and the 
increasing threat of lawsuits attached to these kinds of books. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like working on a real case," he remembers about "The Onion Field." 
"Trying to uncover truths that nobody had uncovered yet and have some things 
make sense." 
</P>
<P>
Yet after that book was published to wide acclaim in 1973, he returned to 
fiction in "The Choirboys" and "The Black Marble." 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard to find nonfiction cases that are interesting," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be something that I think I can uncover in the course of an 
investigation and writing about something. In the Pitchfork case," he says, 
referring to "The Blooding" crime, "it was a chance to write about a classic 
sociopath in a country where they don't even use that word. I don't know if in 
England they just don't have as many as we do. 
</P>
<P>
"And the discovery of genetic fingerprinting (was appealing), of course," 
Wambaugh continues. "It's momentous. It's the biggest thing to happen in 
forensic science in my lifetime. There's no limitations on what's going to 
happen with this. A hat found at the scene of a crime belonging to a murderer 
could now theoretically positively identify the murderer from all other human 
beings on the face of the Earth on the basis of sweat. I mean, that's 
theoretically possible. It's unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Real-life Mystery 
</P>
<P>
COLIN PITCHFORK is the name of the 25-year-old baker who raped and strangled 
the two schoolgirls in the village of Narborough, which Wambaugh describes in 
his book as a place of "reassuring granite churches and mossy slate roofs, 
turrets and parapets glowing rosy and amber in the setting sun." After the 
first victim, Lynda Mann, was discovered one morning in a thicket near the 
grounds of a psychiatric hospital, the people of Narborough and two neighboring 
villages were horrified. This sort of thing just didn't happen there. A police 
inquiry that grew to include 150 officers turned up nothing but false leads as 
families worried for the first time about their daughters walking home from 
school unescorted. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation continued for three years, and because no strong local 
suspects emerged, speculation increased that the killer was a drifter who had 
moved on. Until one day, the raped and bruised body of another girl, Dawn 
Ashworth, was found near the psychiatric hospital. This time, suspicion 
centered on a young, slow-witted hospital employee who, under fierce 
interrogation by the police, confessed. Except that he didn't do it, as was 
proved by a new kind of blood test pioneered by a geneticist working at nearby 
Leicester University. 
</P>
<P>
The then-experimental blood test is capable of identifying a person's unique 
DNA pattern, which the police sought to match with the DNA pattern taken from 
samples of semen recovered from the two girls. In an effort to catch the 
killer, more than 4,500 men from the villages volunteered to provide blood 
samples -- or be "blooded," as the police called the procedure. Pitchfork, 
however, eluded the test by having someone else provide a blood sample for him. 
It wasn't until his surrogate later blabbed in a pub that Pitchfork came under 
suspicion and was arrested. Before he was finally given the test, he confessed; 
subsequently, his DNA fingerprint was found to match the semen samples. 
</P>
<P>
Wambaugh has reassembled these events into a suspenseful whodunit, marked by 
his characteristic portraits of harried police officers chasing after shadows 
and vivid descriptions of the crimes. But he found that his methods, honed 
after years of practice, came into question in Britain, a country where murder 
mysteries are beloved as long as they're fiction and true crime stories are 
considered unseemly. 
</P>
<P>
Wambaugh thinks of himself as something of an Anglophile and enjoys British 
soap operas on public television, ("My wife says I watch anything with an 
English accent"), but he says he began to lose his patience with the English 
when he discovered that they weren't eager to cooperate in such a book. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we're alike. We're not at all. Not only are they reticent, but 
they're deliberate, slow to the point of being ponderous in everything they do. 
You have to get a decision like 'Will you give me an interview?' and they want 
to think about it for three days, and then after three days, they may call and 
make an appointment for a fortnight hence. And you don't have a fortnight 
hence. You're sitting in a hotel room freezing to death in February in the 
Midlands, and you have to try to make the English move." 
</P>
<P>
"The Blooding" may be notable for its unveiling of a forensic technique likely 
to make the cerebrations of Sherlock Holmes seem more dated than ever, but it 
is also another encounter with the blank horror of the sociopathic killer, 
someone who kills mechanically and without remorse. 
</P>
<P>
Wambaugh has been drawn to sociopaths (the term is synonymous with psychopath) 
since he traced the lives of Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith, the Onion 
Field killers. Sociopaths turn up in his novels as well. 
</P>
<P>
"They have no capacity for love -- to give or receive love," he points out. 
"More importantly, they have no capacity for guilt. So once you understand 
them, you can quit making unrealistic assumptions. You have no idea how tired I 
get of reading in the newspaper that at the sentencing, 'the defendant showed 
no remorse.' Of course, they show no remorse. There's no remorse in their 
makeup." 
</P>
<P>
Colin Pitchfork, after raping and strangling his second victim, went home and 
baked a cake for his wife. He came from a good family, as did the two convicted 
killers in "Echoes in the Darkness," who were, in fact, suburban Philadelphia 
schoolteachers. 
</P>
<P>
Sociopaths are biologically different from other people, psychiatrists tell us, 
which is not to say they don't know right from wrong. Legally, they're 
considered sane. "They're cortically under-aroused and don't react to punishing 
stimuli," explains J. Reid Meloy, author of "The Psychopathic Mind" and chief 
of forensic mental health services for San Diego County. "We think there's 
something wrong with the limbic system of the brain, which is the source of 
emotion and the ability to bond." 
</P>
<P>
Wambaugh says: "I'm very interested in the concept of the sociopath -- very 
interested -- because my conscience has bothered me all my life. Talk about 
regrets -- I have about 20 every day. I was educated in Catholic schools, and 
they did that to me. So I have to cope with a conscience all the time. And I'm 
interested in a creature who has none of that." 
</P>
<P>
Wambaugh, who is Irish and German, was an altar boy during his early years in 
East Pittsburgh. He was an only child -- his father was a policeman and a 
steelworker -- and came to California with his parents when he was 14. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his Catholic upbringing, Wambaugh doesn't like to talk about good and 
evil, especially in connection with a man like Colin Pitchfork. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't deal with that if you'll notice. I don't know about evil and good. I 
gave up on that a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
He recalls when he first became aware of sociopaths as a policeman: "I'd be 
putting guys away who were going to prison for a long time for doing horrible 
things. And certain symptoms kept showing themselves." Excessive manipulation 
was a common feature. "And I just came to realize in a very fundamental way 
that these guys were different. But evil didn't seem to do it for me. I was 
brought up to believe that evil took some energy in itself. You had to make a 
conscious choice to do this bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
"But I realized with these guys that they weren't making choices of any kind. 
They were doing what came natural to them when they raped, when they killed. 
That's when I started looking into this business." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Misunderstood Loner 
</P>
<P>
THE VIEW FROM the Wambaughs' outdoor deck is across lower Newport Bay toward a 
piece of the coastline where an enormous home is being built right on the 
water. The sight of the ungainly structure draws a mutter of annoyance from the 
author, who is dressed in dirty jeans and a black hooded sweatshirt. He leans 
back in a deck chair and sips from a can of beer. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Wambaugh is usually annoyed -- and often angered -- by something. His books 
boil with contempt for the vanities and venalities of Southern California and 
the world; his soul-bandaged heroes are usually tripping over one moral outrage 
or another. There are his storied battles with Hollywood -- he once took out a 
full-page ad in Daily Variety excoriating Lorimar Productions and director 
Robert Aldrich for manhandling his book "The Choirboys." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Dee, says he is sometimes misunderstood. "He does march to his own 
drummer. He's not usually willing to play along with games and make busywork 
and meet for lunch to be stroked or do any stroking. He's very blunt and brings 
things right out in the open and is very decisive. It's hard for him to fit 
into group efforts -- like film making. He's a little different. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a lot more relaxed and easy and flexible and bendable, and he's not, but I 
admire his qualities." 
</P>
<P>
"She's the easiest person in the world to get along with," Wambaugh says of 
Dee, who grew up the daughter of an ironworker in Claremont. "She likes 
everyone, and everybody likes her. It's not the same with me, for sure. She 
doesn't worry about anything, and I worry about lots of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
What has Wambaugh worried right now is lawsuits against nonfiction crime 
writers like himself. He has yet to lose in court, but the suits have cost him 
time and money. One suit, in which defense lawyer Irving Kanarek charged that 
he was unfairly portrayed in "The Onion Field," went on for 12 years. Wambaugh 
shakes his head slowly, and his green eyes flare again. "For 12 years, you're 
sending checks to a lawyer. It's unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
"They get somebody I've written about to take a shot at me -- these . . . 
contingency lawyers. The fact is, they have nothing to lose. They sue me, I 
prevail. I get nothing except legal fees." 
</P>
<P>
The suit by former San Diego Officer Kenneth Kelly over "Lines and Shadows" was 
filed in 1984 even though Kelly had signed a so-called personal depiction 
waiver, as did the other 12 members of the department's experimental border 
task force. (All were paid $5,000 to $10,000 for their stories.) Kelly's suit 
claims that the author "exaggerated or invented" portions of the book and 
distorted the facts to make him look "frivolous, flippant and irresponsible 
toward his job as a law-enforcement officer." 
</P>
<P>
In the book, Wambaugh described how Kelly and others in the squad routinely 
sedated themselves after nights of war zone terror with the aid of dizzying 
amounts of liquor and women other than their wives. 
</P>
<P>
After Kelly's suit was tossed out by a lower court judge the following year, it 
was reinstated in 1986 by a state appellate court. It is scheduled to go to 
trial in September, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Wambaugh is also being sued by Jay Smith, the Pennsylvania high school 
principal convicted of murdering a young woman and her two children in Upper 
Merion Township. Smith, who has never admitted guilt, has taken issue with 
Wambaugh's conclusions in "Echoes in the Darkness," including the author's 
description of him as "having a face like an obscene phone call." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Writers and Pressed Suits 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE, WAMBAUGH chooses to point out, rarely see themselves as others see 
them. He warned the San Diego officers in advance: "I'm going to portray you 
the way I see you after my total investigation, and you might not like it. In 
fact, I guarantee you that none of you will like everything." 
</P>
<P>
"When 'The Blooding' comes out," he says, "maybe someone over in Leicestershire 
will sue me. I don't know. But I don't settle. I'm one of the few writers who 
can afford to fight these things. So I feel an obligation to do it." 
</P>
<P>
His obligation has extended to testifying on behalf of other writers as well. A 
year and a half ago, Wambaugh testified for Joe McGinniss, author of "Fatal 
Vision," when McGinniss was being sued by Jeffrey MacDonald. MacDonald, the 
North Carolina doctor convicted of murdering his wife and family, claimed that 
McGinniss had initially assured him that he believed in MacDonald's innocence 
and so had breached their contract when he wrote in his book that MacDonald was 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
The case resulted in a hung jury and an out-of-court settlement, a conclusion 
that Wambaugh considers astonishing and alarming. In the end, only one juror 
voted for McGinniss. 
</P>
<P>
On the witness stand, Wambaugh explained how, while conducting interviews for 
"The Onion Field," he did what many writers and police investigators have done 
since the beginning of time, which is saying things "that will lubricate the 
flow of conversation." 
</P>
<P>
He replays his testimony now: "If I sit down with a subject who's a 
manipulative sociopath and a murderer, and he says to me, 'I'm going to tell 
you this whole story, but you do believe me when I tell you I never committed 
any crime, don't you?' What am I supposed to say? 'No, I think you're a lying 
sonuvabitch?' The truth? Of course not. I say something like, 'It's very 
possible' or 'I might reserve judgment.' " 
</P>
<P>
Wambaugh becomes incensed all over again as he remembers this. One woman on the 
jury, he recalls, acknowledged that she'd never read a book of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if those jurors believed Joe McGinniss, William F. Buckley and 
Joe Wambaugh -- but they didn't like us. They liked that sociopath who 
slaughtered his family. They didn't believe he did it," Wambaugh says. "They 
looked at that handsome, articulate, Princeton physician, and they said, 'How 
can anybody who looks like that slaughter his own little children?' 
</P>
<P>
"Because the average person just does not have any conception of what a 
sociopath is. None. They can't conceive that a human being who's educated and 
articulate cannot have any conscience. It's too tough a concept," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Press accounts in England at the time of Pitchfork's arrest and conviction 
looked for signs of evil in the young baker's eyes and in his smile. In "The 
Blooding," Wambaugh seeks to correct such errant notions while explaining that 
Pitchfork's startling indifference to the proceedings against him should be 
understood simply as clinical behavior. 
</P>
<P>
And behavior, oddly enough, that the author says does not make him angry. Colin 
Pitchfork, he argues, is no worse morally than the next person. 
</P>
<P>
"That's right. In terms of making moral judgments. I don't make them. I would 
be the first one to lock them up if I could convict them of something, 
realizing that they ain't gonna get better. They're not going to get 'cured.' 
</P>
<P>
"But when I recognize somebody is a sociopath, I stop getting mad at the guy. 
It's a clinical definition. He's fish, and I'm fowl." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crimes of the Free 
</P>
<P>
MURDER IS RARE in England contrasted with the United States, where the FBI 
estimates that there are 350 serial killers at large and where semiautomatic 
weapons fire is now commonly traded by rival youth gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Wambaugh, the poet laureate of the police, must have his own thoughts 
about this, about the solution to sociopaths and gangs and mass murderers, 
about the steadily increasing cases of predatory violence in the land of 
baseball and immigrants' dreams. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks about this a moment and says: "We have an extraordinary amount of 
freedom. There's an extraordinary amount of freedom to commit crime. Societies 
that have less freedom have less crime. We might have to curtail our freedoms 
to a certain extent. We can't be so free to do everything we like perhaps. " 
</P>
<P>
As the discovery of genetic fingerprinting turns another page in the Orwellian 
book of the future, this former cop reads into it only good news. 
</P>
<P>
"Before you and I leave this valley of tears, I assure you that there will be 
DNA banks. The ACLU will yell about it -- they're already yelling about it, 
saying it smacks of Big Brotherism and all of that. But you know you can't stop 
it. It's too valuable and important. It's going to happen. It just eliminates 
lengthy criminal trials . . . that go on for two years and cost the taxpayers 
millions of dollars. Guys are already pleading guilty when faced with this, all 
over America." 
</P>
<P>
It's enough to make one of Wambaugh's mournful cops raise a glass and push back 
the darkness for another 20 minutes. Man being what he is, maybe you can't ask 
for anything more than that. The quality of optimism is necessarily strained. 
Next case.

By Arthur Kleinman, Kleinman is author of Rethinking Psychiatry (The Free 
Press) and The Illness Narratives (Basic Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Twelve years ago, when I became a cancer patient, what particularly enraged me 
-- and distracted me from my own terror and despair at my doctors' gloomy 
prognosis -- was seeing how much the very reputation of this illness added to 
the suffering of those who have it." So Susan Sontag explains the reason she 
wrote her influential "Illness as Metaphor": "I didn't think it would be useful 
-- and I wanted to be useful -- to tell yet one more story in the first person 
of how someone learned that she or he had cancer, wept, struggled, was 
comforted, suffered, took courage . . . though mine was also that story. A 
narrative, it seemed to me, would be less useful than an idea." The idea was 
that the dread metaphors of cancer degrade the experience of the patient, 
inhibit help seeking for early detection and contribute to a demoralization 
that undercuts the effort to get competent treatment. Worse still, they blame 
the victim. 
</P>
<P>
Now Sontag turns to the terrifying new disease that has replaced cancer as the 
most feared, as the epitome of evil. Applying metaphors to AIDS -- an invasion, 
a pollution, an alienating, repulsive taint of deadly sin -- intensifies the 
victims' deep fears of degrading pain. At the same time, these cultural 
messages spread panic, encourage hatred and offer a "rhetorical opportunity" to 
fulminate against sufferers as blameworthy and deserving of punishment. AIDS 
fosters authoritarian political ideologies that promote fear in order to 
tighten social control. Thus, AIDS becomes one of the subverting, apocalyptic 
catastrophies -- uncontrollable pollution, unstoppable migration, unserviceable 
debt, plagues of crime and drugs, genetic mutations, conspiracy -- that 
recrudesce as the millennium nears. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, fear of sexuality and of plague-ridden communities strengthen the 
commercial culture of self-interest. Capitalism commodifies the body through 
preventive practices, prophylactic disciplines. The ancient idea of miasma 
resurfaces as Sontag's old bete noire, psychosomatic tropes that hold the 
patient responsible for suffering. A survivalist mentality erects walls around 
white, heterosexual, middle-class Americans: We fail to see the increasingly 
highest-risk populations: African and Caribbean men and women; poor people of 
color in America's inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
The logical culmination of this symbolic vision is that there is a struggle for 
the "rhetorical ownership of AIDS"; therapeutics and prevention should be 
extended into the realm of meanings to remove those that inflict stigma. Of all 
the metaphors of AIDS, the one she selects for retirement is the military trope 
of viral "invasions" and immunological "defenses" and "aggressive" medicine, 
which Sontag, wrongly as it turns out, associates with the rise of modern 
medical thinking around the germ theory of disease and the search for 
antibiotics and other magic bullets. For the wartime imagery, she avers, 
inevitably leads from the demonizing of illness to the stigmatizing and blaming 
of patients. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot is sparkling writing, quirky and tendentious and yet impressive and 
useful, in an analysis of cultural meanings: an intellectualist account of the 
"idea" of AIDS. But all serious illnesses embody a dialectic between shared (if 
contested) cultural signification and the always particular meaning of the 
lived experience of suffering for patients, their family and friends, and their 
professional care givers. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS, like cancer and heart disease and diabetes, is not only an idea: It is 
cramping pain, the disturbing sounds and difficult-to-take sights and smells of 
basic bodily processes gone terribly awry, the sting and choke of deep despair, 
especially the isolation and loneliness that come from near-total preoccupation 
with survival. This most personally unique, therefore most human, meaning of 
illness begins with the loss of a world -- leaving behind the country of the 
healthy -- extends through a limbo of enervating uncertainty and waiting, and 
terminates in the preparation for death, when, as if their faces were pressed 
against the terminal window, the sick look backward toward receding corridors 
of biography and ahead toward ultimate meaning. 
</P>
<P>
Sontag starts from Aristotle's definition of metaphor. Emmanuel Dreuilhe starts 
from a different place. Like American soldiers in the killing fields of the 
Pacific War, who thanked God for the Atomic Bomb, which for them brought the 
deadly ordeal at last to an end, Dreuilhe's remarkable narrative of a personal 
battle with AIDS, which is written as a military allegory of the experience of 
a soldier in combat, clarifies that what is at stake in the experience of AIDS 
patients is survival under immensely threatening and all-too-often inhuman 
circumstances. This victim's vision, like the soldier's perspective on 
Hiroshima, may be too particularistic and biased by the practical demands of 
survival to sustain a viable ethical position, but it does infuse a powerful 
vitality into the narrative. Dreuilhe has no time for commentators on AIDS: 
</P>
<P>
"This plague has attracted the inevitable swarm of AIDS researchers, officials, 
businessmen and journalists, and they are the ones who have monopolized the 
media. We people with AIDS, who devote each waking moment to our own survival, 
have been unable to prevent those loquacious experts from stealing our thunder 
and robbing us of the only thing we have left: our illness . . . (they) have 
accumulated a considerable store of information and conclusions about our genes 
and our mores, our mode of socialization and our myths, but in so doing, 
they've lost sight of our humanity." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't stand it when civilians talk about AIDS. What do they know about it? 
How can they claim any authority when they're completely untouched by it, 
without a simple wound or symptom?" 
</P>
<P>
Dreuilhe adopts the very metaphor Sontag is repelled by: 
</P>
<P>
"My personal war began two years ago when I was mobilized by AIDS. . . . On 
this same corporal survey map, I could also indicate the organs once believed 
lost to the enemy retaken after bitter fighting, backed up by an artillery 
barrage of antiviral and sulfa drugs, chemical weapons in that trench warfare 
which has kept me pinned down for almost two years now." 
</P>
<P>
He begins his letters to friends with "News From the Front." What Sontag 
regards as the abuse of metaphor and medicine, for Dreuilhe is the source of 
carrying on against the odds. During psychotherapy, of all places, he 
discovered that a military myth sustained him and gave encouraging meaning to 
an otherwise futile battle. He refuses, like some AIDS patients, to give up 
without a fight, believing they are receiving a deserved punishment; Dreuilhe 
goes beyond cultural message to speak with great eloquence about menacing 
interior meaning: "Even more than our immunity, it's our confidence that the 
virus has destroyed. We no longer believe in ourselves or in all those who have 
betrayed and deceived us. . . . For me, AIDS was first of all the experience of 
solitude. . . . That's the state to which AIDS patients should aspire: to throw 
themselves so deeply into the struggle in which they are embroiled that peace 
and fear melt away, allowing better instincts to prevail over panic and 
despair. Fight, not flight." 
</P>
<P>
"Death," Dreuilhe recognizes, " -- the incongruity of its presence in our still 
young lives -- is the height of absurdity: It makes a mockery of all my efforts 
to continue to live normally despite its constant threat." 
</P>
<P>
"Woe to the vanquished. That's the ultimate fate of people with AIDS, to be 
losers in a society obsessed with winning. From the moment someone is stricken 
with AIDS, all his previous accomplishments are retroactively annulled." 
</P>
<P>
Sontag, fighting a rear-guard action against the psychologizing of moral 
experience, which she seems to believe trivializes life and alienates the 
sufferer, must have been astounded to read Dreuilhe's entirely different view 
of the matter: "For AIDS is perhaps above all a mental illness, not so much 
because the virus may affect our brain as because it forces upon us such 
isolation and anguish that it drives us mad." 
</P>
<P>
In the acknowledgements to Dreuilhe's book, placed, untypically, at the back, 
one reads with some surprise that "this American edition is the result of the 
kind and patient efforts of Susan Sontag, Richard Howard, and Steve Wasserman." 
Perhaps because of the side of her cancer experience that she chose not to 
tell, Sontag must have recognized the difference between the idea and the 
experience of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if I wind up dying of AIDS like all the others," Dreuilhe writes, "I'm no 
longer afraid of it because these pages have purified me, given meaning -- at 
least for me -- to these last three years of care, grief, and mourning, a 
meaning that is intensely personal." 
</P>
<P>
And that is the very essence of the difference. Read Sontag and ponder the 
symbolic coherence of AIDS as literary allusion and intellectual conundrum and 
thereby consider, what are metaphors for? Read Dreuilhe to tell you how 
particular to the sick person's biography and world life with AIDS is, and 
thereby bear witness with him of human suffering and consider, what is life 
for?

August Sarnitz's "R. M. Schindler" (Rizzoli: $35; 224 pp.; 0-8478-0921-8) 
documents the career of one of the most influential and innovative architects 
who ever practiced in Los Angeles. Born in Austria in 1887, schooled at the 
legendary Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, and apprenticed under Frank Lloyd 
Wright, Rudolf Michael Schindler opened an office in Los Angeles in 1921 to 
champion the simple, functional and well-detailed designs of the so-called 
International Style. While dutifully tracing Schindler's work and philosophy, 
Sarnitz, in this dry, awkwardly designed, academic monograph, unfortunately 
fails to convey the pioneering spirit of the architect and how he adapted his 
rationally conceived designs to the varied landscape and life styles of 
Southern California. Nevertheless, the book is valuable, if only for the 
cataloging of Schindler's wealth of projects here with plans, drawings and 
photographs (many -- like the one above, of the Falk apartments -- by Julius 
Shulman) and extracts from Schindler's extensive correspondence. Sam Hall

A CHASE THRILLER RUNNING ON ALL CYLINDERS; 
</P>
<P>
DADDY BY LOUP DURAND (VILLARD BOOKS: $18.95; 377 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mort Kamins, Kamins is a free-lance writer. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"To write a thriller," the late John Braine once proposed, "you begin with 
improbability. . . . The hero must always be in danger. He must at least once 
be helpless in the hands of the enemy, and he must escape." 
</P>
<P>
Loup Durand follows this formula slavishly. "Daddy," a major best seller in 
France and throughout Europe, not only begins with improbability but remains 
consistently improbable, even absurd, throughout. In doing so, it makes one 
consider the entire question of genre writing. For one would expect that any 
book so formulaic would lie there lifeless, inert, at best a book you keep 
reading for its plot while you berate yourself for surrendering to such obvious 
claptrap. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, this book is alive and vibrant, compelling in its suspense, rich in 
character and incident. Set in Europe during World War II, the story is put 
into motion when an elderly banker, who has funneled hundreds of millions of 
dollars out of Germany for Jews and others, is caught and tortured by the 
Nazis. He leaps from a window to his death before he discloses the immensely 
complex series of secret access codes, which alone would allow the Nazis to 
reach those funds. Only his granddaughter, Maria, knows the codes, and she has 
taught them to her only son, the genius Thomas, who holds them all in his head. 
</P>
<P>
The Nazis want that information and set up a fiendishly effective team to track 
it down. Essentially, the book is a manhunt, although the "men" being hunted 
are, first the lovely Maria who has lived a remarkably independent life and who 
is loved and protected by many people, most notably a team of preternaturally 
capable Spanish bodyguards; and later her son, Thomas, an 11-year-old boy of 
inhuman intelligence and perspicacity and yet -- in perhaps the major victory 
for Durand's writing skill -- immensely likable. If we did not care for this 
boy Thomas, if we did not ache for him when he watches his mother die in 
flames, if we did not feel his unwillingness to attach himself to others when 
he has seen so many who've been kind to him killed, if we did not feel his 
darknesses and his hatreds and his fears, there would be no book. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, we have to suspend disbelief here. This boy with his "rat's 
instinct," his "frightening abnormal lucidity," has the ability to outthink, 
outplan, outfox, an immensely resourceful adversary, the epicene Nazi genius 
Laemmle whose obsession with the boy becomes pathological. They play chess 
against each other, real chess when Thomas is Laemmle's captive, figurative 
chess across the map of Europe when he is on the run. Chess becomes a leitmotiv 
throughout the story. 
</P>
<P>
Much the weakest element in the book is the man who turns out to be Thomas' 
real father, a playboy Rockefeller-type from America, who has never known of 
Thomas' existence. David Quartermain is totally apolitical, a man of no 
commitments, completely uninterested in the family international banking 
business (which turns out to have continuing important connections with Nazi 
Germany throughout the war). Ultimately, David responds to Maria's summoning 
him to Europe and becomes Dick Daring, performing astonishing feats of bravery, 
skill and planning. It's as difficult to believe most of this as it is to 
accept that a man of obvious intelligence and wealth in 1942 would not know why 
France was bisected into occupied and Vichy-controlled sectors, or what a 
"Petainist" was. Quartermain seems almost a Frenchman's view of the noble 
savage, ignorant but instinctively in touch with the good and the true. 
</P>
<P>
The great success of "Daddy" is in Durand's teeming imagination. An abundance 
of plot, of imagination, of incident, lends a richness to the book's texture -- 
no minimalism here -- yet never buries the main narrative thrust -- the chase. 
Along the road of life, we meet dozens of characters who are individually 
delineated -- Nazis brutal and cynical, brilliant and dense, French chevaliers 
and graspers, ordinary people fearful or singularly brave, (although there 
certainly seem to be more Resistance heroes per hectare than history, as Marcel 
Ophuls has pitilessly revealed it, really produced). This is not genre fiction 
as high art, in the Le Carre mode, but it is commercial fiction of great skill 
and energy. 
</P>
<P>
A word about the translation from the French by J. Maxwell Brownjohn: It is 
seamless and idiomatic, without a single clumsy construction. It's a remarkable 
achievement to sustain a breakneck narrative pace and never once sound as if 
the book was written in anything other than English.

FROM POLITICAL THEATER TO POLITICAL FARCE; 
</P>
<P>
PATTERNS OF ABUSE BY JOHN H. TAYLOR (WYNWOOD PRESS: $18.95; 383 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dick Lochte, Lochte's most recent novel, Laughing Dog, will be reprinted in 
paperback by Warner Books this fall. His next novel, The Burial Society, will 
be published later this year. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"No matter how many friends he may think he has in the press . . . the 
President must recognize that his relationship with the media is inherently 
adversarial." 
</P>
<P>
These cautionary words from a recent issue of TV Guide were penned by no less 
an experienced hand at adversarial press relationships than Richard Nixon. They 
might well have been used as the basis for the debut novel by his chief aide, 
John H. Taylor's, about a White House under siege by the Washington Post. Not 
surprisingly, Taylor has stacked the deck rather heavily against the Fourth 
Estate, but in spite of that (or even, I shudder to suggest, because of it), 
the book is a very entertaining study of the abuse of press -- and political -- 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Set in the very near future, Taylor's America is a little different from the 
one we now know. Jack Kemp is governor of New York. Ben Bradlee has retired to 
teach at the Columbia Journalism School; his desk at the Post has been filled 
by a self-serving Machiavelli named George Stevens. And the country has just 
seen a presidential shift from California Republican Ronald Reagan to Louisiana 
Democrat Eugene Hoskins, a chief executive whose political philosophy seems 
slightly to the right of Reagan's. 
</P>
<P>
Hoskins has a big problem. An ambitious, obnoxious and unconscionable young 
Post reporter plans on breaking the news of a top-secret mission to rescue 
hostages from Lebanon, thereby threatening the success of the venture. What's a 
right-thinking President to do? He orders the FBI to lock up the reporter until 
the hostages are safely home. The raid is successful, but the incarceration 
isn't. The reporter dies in a car crash and a cover-up is attempted. It doesn't 
work, and the Post is in position to bring down another President. 
</P>
<P>
Though its specifics are unique, the situation -- with the press nipping at 
wounded politicians' scuffling heels like bush dogs coming off the eight-week 
low-cholesterol diet -- is more than faintly familiar from both fiction and 
nonfiction. Happily, Taylor presents it with neither pretentiousness nor 
rancor. This is not a political morality tale. Nor is it a mirthless paranoid 
thriller, though it includes some skulduggery in Paris and murder in 
Washington. It is instead a well-crafted yarn in which we are taken on a 
generally intriguing tour through the complex jungles of D.C. politics, with 
rumor, fables and facts convincingly melded. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, we meet the President's security adviser, a nimble-witted man of 
middle age who is the novel's protagonist; his paramour, a beautiful young 
reporter (the only heroic journalist in evidence); the aforementioned evil and 
manipulative Post editor; a rather dim Republican senator with presidential 
ambitions; a trusted member of the National Security Council who leaks the 
scandal to get her hated brother into hot water (his identity is a secret 
Taylor rightly keeps as long as possible); a collection of reporters of varying 
political persuasions who wittily bat the news about on a weekend TV show; and 
an assortment of military men, pols and media mites blessed with the gift of 
gritty gab. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some other novelists who deal with national and international politics, 
Taylor is particularly straightforward in telling his story. We can actually 
follow the plot. His characters are credible and their dialogue has an 
authentic tone. And he convinces us that we are on the inside of a world that 
is as chillingly authentic as it is shadowy. 
</P>
<P>
The author's main failings are 1) that the ethics of the presidential act are 
never really addressed and 2) that he indulges in such aggressive media-bashing 
that one begins to feel sorry for even the likes of Geraldo Rivera. Those in 
the news-gathering profession will probably be annoyed by this apparent bias. 
</P>
<P>
But how angry can you be with an author who is able to so stylishly sum up 
recent D.C. history? "Watergate was Shakespeare," he writes, "and the 
Iran-Contra affair was Gilbert and Sullivan, complete with the very model of a 
modern lieutenant colonel. In journalist argot, they were both 'great political 
theater.' At curtain's fall -- as Nixon flew his living, breathing, bruised 
family to their Orange County Elba and Reagan's shaky hand reached out for his 
smiling new Russian friend and his newest prop, a pen for signing treaties -- 
many Washingtonians were strangely wistful as they filed back out into the 
neon-bright real world."

A CHILD AT THE BOMBING OF DRESDEN;

FAREWELL, DRESDEN BY HENRI COULONGES; TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH BY LOWELL BAIR

<P>
"Farewell, Dresden" is a heart-rending novel that throws history into your face 
in a way that it hurts. When the 12-year-old Johanna Seyfert goes to the circus 
with her best friend, Hella, she has not even an inkling that these will be the 
last hours of playful innocence before her life changes irrevocably. In typical 
adolescent fashion, the two girls are mostly annoyed when air raid sirens 
interrupt the performance and force them to seek shelter in the basement with 
hundreds of strangers. Besides, their mothers had always assured them that 
Dresden would never be bombed as severely as Hamburg because it had no 
munitions factories and too many priceless art treasures and, as Johanna 
remarks, "They know it's carnival time, and the streets are full of children." 
But as history has shown, the American Allies couldn't have cared less about 
children when they turned Dresden into a rubble-desert with fire bombs in 
1943-44. The two manage to sneak out of the shelter and find themselves lost in 
a city of raging firestorms, debris and ashes where children and their mothers 
are lying on the pavement, "really flattened. I could only see their shapes," 
as Johanna recalls with horror. 
</P>
<P>
But this is only the beginning of her long, harrowing journey that will be 
permeated with tragedy and losses, prematurely changing her from a smart, 
precocious kid into a wise, compassionate young woman. Hella is the first one 
who gets killed, followed by Johanna's older sister, Grete, who she finds at 
home in the destroyed basement together with their mother, Leni, who is in a 
state of shock and who will never again snap out of her protective craziness. 
</P>
<P>
Not without a feeling of satisfaction, Johanna switches roles, resuming 
responsibility for her helpless mother and leads them out of the city, 
following groups of wandering people who tell her, "We're castaways. But you 
can also say that we're survivors." It is on this road that she hears about 
strange things, like raping Russians, and even more strange, concentration 
camps, from a feisty woman who reassures her wearily, "You'll know about them 
some day." 
</P>
<P>
Along the way we get to know Johanna much better, and she is a wonderfully 
observant, sensual girl, savvy and sensitive, prickly and practical. She's 
rather dark with black curly hair which makes her happy, because she took after 
her beloved father, an archeologist who was killed earlier in the war, while 
sister Grete was fair and blond, just like her mother whose favorite she was. 
Johanna is still jealous and fights fiercely for her mother's love and 
approval, but she barely recognizes her. "Don't you know I could have been 
killed too?" she yells at the catatonic Leni at one point, "but I'm here, 
Mutti. You still have me." 
</P>
<P>
They find refuge in a choirmaster's house full of children where Johanna falls 
in love with Franz, a rather amorous youngster with a wounded leg who proposes 
marriage to the flirtatious girl. He also tells her about Jews and that the 
Germans had it coming with the bombing because of the concentration camps and 
the Nazis and all that. Sometimes Johanna reminisces longingly about her "old 
life" that had ended only a short while ago, and wishes that "there should have 
been something . . . maybe a different smell in the air, something that would 
at least have given us a little warning." Later, when she learns that Franz's 
leg has to be amputated, she's overcome with anger and resentment and thinks: 
"Why did the people she loved have to be crippled, mentally or physically? What 
good was a mother who looked like a scarecrow and forgot her as soon as she was 
out of sight? How could she adore a boy with one leg?" 
</P>
<P>
Johanna and Leni have to move on because Leni needs treatment, so they go to 
Prague where Leni is sent to a psychiatric clinic and Johanna stays with Josef 
Hutka, an old acquaintance of her father. Being all of a sudden a girl with the 
same nationality as the predatory oppressors of this magnificent city, she gets 
her first and unexpected bitter taste of hatred. She stops speaking German out 
of fear on her daylong excursions through Prague with the professor, a lyrical 
and lonely old man who falls in love with the tender and tantalizing Teutonic 
Amazon, because she looks like the reincarnation of his long lost true love. 
</P>
<P>
It is in this part of the book that the story becomes magical by its stunning 
innovative beauty, and it becomes apparent that this is a book about love, 
transition and continuation. Johanna is like a mythical person, a radiant, 
untamed apparition who comes into everybody's life like a bewitching goddess to 
stir up deep emotions, to heal wounds and to replace and evoke treasured 
moments and beloved people that were lost or longed for. 
</P>
<P>
She learns that life is precious in wars, that nothing is of permanence or even 
remains the same for very long. As the last moments of war are approaching and 
she is alone, surrounded by the liberated Czech citizens whose hatred for 
everything German erupts like a firestorm, she recognizes that she cannot hold 
on to anything, not her sister, her best friend, the professor, her mother and 
in the end, not even herself. After her mother is shot, a woman approaches her 
in German: " 'So you are that bitch's daughter! She's dead, and good riddance!' 
Johanna saw an ordinary woman with two eyes, a nose, a mouth -- a mouth that 
said that." In a fateful second of transparency, she is overwhelmed by a 
thought. She remembers a quotation she had once heard, and now she understood 
it: " 'We are guilty and shall remain so. It will never end.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Farewell, Dresden" is a small masterpiece, beautifully written (in the 
tradition of Heinrich Boll's "Group Picture With Lady"), heartbreaking and 
devastating in its depiction of the irreparable damage of war and the cruelty 
of the extinction of bodies and souls. The author managed that extraordinarily 
difficult task to create a moving, realistic and rich portrait of war by 
letting us into the life of a vivacious, courageous and very noble young girl. 
Here, war rages on between the lines. 
</P>
<P>
There are no gratuitous descriptions of carnage and violence, no talk about 
politics and Nazis -- and most of all, no judgment. Johanna could be any girl 
in any country. Loss, love and hope transcend borders and nationalities. 
Because of that universality, it's one of the most poignant and inspiring 
anti-war novels I have ever read.

PRIVATE LIVES: LET'S CALL THE WHOLE THING OFF;

<P>
THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS REVOLUTION IS THREATENING TO END HER LOVE AFFAIR WITH 
THE PHONE

TAKE MY TELEPHONE -- please. The love affair that began when I got a 
powder-blue Princess phone for my 16th birthday is on the rocks. After spending 
the happiest years of my life hand in hand with my receiver, blissfully gabbing 
with friends and, for that matter, strangers, I want to call the whole thing 
off. My phone and I are still living together, but it's just not the same. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't live in L.A. and hate your phone," says my friend Wendy, who is 
madly in love with hers. "That's like living in New York and hating the bus." 
</P>
<P>
I really do want to save our relationship. But my phone won't give me any 
space. Every time I turn around, I am urged to commit to yet another 
telecommunications breakthrough that promises to keep me perpetually plugged in 
-- car phones, picture phones, mobile phones, fax machines, pocket pagers. When 
will someone sell me privacy? 
</P>
<P>
Still, I'm afraid to make a break. All our friends will side with my phone. "I 
can't wait until they invent a wrist phone," says Wendy, who is calling from 
her bathtub. "I don't wear a watch, but I'd wear a phone. Just imagine -- 
wherever I go, my number would go too. It might be a little annoying when I'm 
with people and I'm talking to my hand, but still I think it would be great." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like hell to me. My phone used to be Mr. Nice Guy, but lately he's 
developed a cruel streak. Once, I was gently invited to reach out and touch 
someone. Now, I'm threatened with warnings about what will happen to my life, 
my family and my career if I refuse to join the interconnection revolution. 
</P>
<P>
I switch on the television. Two women executives are sipping white-wine 
spritzers. One is gloating over the other's failure to get a big promotion 
because she chose an inferior office communications system. The gloater has the 
inner smile that comes with the right equipment. Even the Yellow Pages have 
become menacing and guilt-inducing. "I tried to let you know, but there was no 
answer," says the pitch for call-forwarding thoughtfully repeated every few 
pages, along with equally shame- or fear-provoking plugs for three-way-calling, 
speed-dialing and call-waiting. 
</P>
<P>
My once-obliging phone has become far too demanding. Guests arrive at my house 
for dinner and, instead of bringing flowers or wine, they are accompanied by a 
slew of forwarded phone calls. Just when it seems like old times and I'm having 
a heart-to-heart with a friend, the moment is spoiled by a call-waiting beep. 
"How are you?" has been officially replaced with "Can I put you on hold?" 
</P>
<P>
But I shouldn't be offended. "People just can't stand unanswered questions," 
explains Chaytor D. Mason, a USC associate professor of human factors, a field 
that deals with the psychological aspects of the work environment. When you 
know there's a call waiting, "your interest and fear grow magnificently second 
by second," Mason says. "No matter who you're talking to, you're going to put 
them on hold." And is there a better caller on line No. 2? No, says Mason: "You 
invariably get a guy trying to sell you gold shares." 
</P>
<P>
I could use gold shares. My formerly humble telephone has developed expensive 
tastes. I long ago gave up trying to understand the luxuriant profusion of 
surcharges on my phone bill. And those costs don't even include the phones. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, my bedroom extension died. I went to the phone mart to buy an 
inexpensive red Trimline phone without a memory dialer, intercom, clock radio, 
answering machine or coffee maker. I would have had better luck finding a pair 
of tin cans with a string. 
</P>
<P>
However, I did discover that for the right price (high!) I could own a work of 
telephone art: a football helmet, a cabin cruiser (complete with foghorn 
ringer), a grand piano, a pair of lips, a red spike-heeled shoe, a trout, 
Mickey Mouse, a dozing Garfield (who opens his eyes when you pick up the 
receiver) and Quacky, a mallard decoy. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of our most popular models," exclaimed the salesman. "Instead of 
ringing, he quacks." If anything quacked at me at 7 in the morning, I'd shoot 
it. The salesman then tried to sell me on the virtues of a mobile phone: "You 
can make a call from the middle of a field." 
</P>
<P>
What am I supposed to say? "Hi, Mom, I'm in the middle of a field so I thought 
I'd give you a ring. Whoops, gotta go, the cow has to call her broker." Still, 
"people are now willing to spend thousands of dollars to maintain a sense of 
control over the world," says USC's Mason. "As far as they're concerned, the 
more information per second, the better." 
</P>
<P>
As far as I'm concerned, my phone is trying to change me into a control freak. 
And I'm not the only one who feels the pressure. Today, even gardeners have 
beepers. What kind of crisis do they need to respond to -- a sudden aphid 
infestation? Mason explains: "A lot of people who aren't anybody will buy a car 
phone or a beeper just to feel important. It's the same sense of control people 
feel when they strap on a .38. They aren't planning to kill anybody, but they 
feel more powerful." 
</P>
<P>
I refuse to get in a power struggle with my telephone. I opt for a temporary 
separation. I turn off my ringer and let my machine take my calls. And what do 
I miss? Not a three-picture deal at Columbia. An automatic voice trying to sell 
me aluminum siding. A heavy breather who leaves an obscene message. Three 
business associates I called months ago who now merrily announce that we are 
playing telephone tag. And a couple of calls from my friend Monica, who's been 
too busy to get together for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, she knocks on my door the following morning. "Why didn't you call me 
back?" she wails. A thousand excuses cross my mind: I left town without my 
answering-machine remote control. Her line was busy, or, better still, there 
was no answer. I was in a dugout canoe going up the Amazon. Unfortunately, 
state-of-the-art phone technology negates all of these rationalizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe your machine is broken. Or you accidentally called my computer's line," 
suggests Monica, who wants to give me the benefit of the doubt. 
</P>
<P>
I don't deserve it. I deliberately broke the first commandment of our 
accessibility-obsessed society: Thou Shalt Not Miss a Call. "I had a fight with 
my telephone," I confess. 
</P>
<P>
"Sounds serious," says Monica. "Why don't we talk about it over lunch?" 
</P>
<P>
We are halfway out the door when my phone rings. I lunge for the receiver like 
one of Pavlov's dogs. "Wait a second," I tell Monica. "I've got to take this 
call."

HAIR, MAKEUP AND FRAGRANCES ECHO FASHION'S NEW LIGHTENED-UP LOOK 
</P>

<P>
WHEN FASHION DESIGNERS show chiffon and lace for daytime, as they did at spring 
previews, the result is a season of softness -- flowing lines rather than 
geometric shapes, subdued rather than garish colors. With this message of 
softness emanating from the fashion capitals -- Milan, Paris, New York and 
Tokyo -- beauty decision makers are responding in kind: Spring makeup, hair and 
even fragrances are softer, gentler and less restricted than at any time since 
the '60s, when flower children introduced the no-makeup look. 
</P>
<P>
But the new soft look doesn't mean no makeup. Paradoxically, to achieve a 
softer look, women may find themselves wearing more makeup than ever before. 
What they wear, however, will be applied with a light hand and with precise 
attention to detail. The ultimate goal is to look refined -- emphatically not 
bare-faced or unfinished, which was fashionable in the '60s and early 1970s. 
The pale lips, fragile eyelids and unexaggerated cheekbones that are the 
signatures of spring are carefully highlighted with new, more delicate shades. 
</P>
<P>
The season's beauty focus is on individuality, concentrating on facial features 
rather than on makeup or hair styles. Idiosyncratic characteristics are 
amplified rather than masked to allow an individual's inherent beauty to come 
through. Women who have "quirky" features -- freckles, full lips, thin lips -- 
will not try to disguise them. Tyen, artistic director for Christian Dior 
cosmetics, says: "There is no contouring. No spots of color. When I look at a 
woman this spring, I don't remember her color. I only remember her beauty." 
</P>
<P>
SUBDUED HUES COLOR THE NEW FACE 
</P>
<P>
FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS, aggressively red lipsticks have been fashionable. This 
season, however, lipsticks in shades of almond, golden pink, dusty rose, even 
brownish-red, border on pale; yet these should never be lighter than natural 
lip tones. And after years of glossy lipsticks, matte finishes are in fashion. 
These "allow you to see natural texture and contours without the distortion 
caused by shiny, creamy lipsticks," says makeup artist Marilyn Young of the Ole 
Henriksen salon in Los Angeles. In the past, although women rejected drying, 
matte-finish lipsticks, manufacturers found that adding moisturizing emollients 
to a matte-finish product was virtually impossible. Now, however, blending 
technology has been improved, permitting the introduction of new, oil-rich 
matte lipsticks. 
</P>
<P>
When the lips are muted, eyes get the attention. This spring, eyelids may be 
shaded with as many as five different powders -- sand, rose, honey, peach, 
sable, for example -- but such amalgams are blended to produce a hint of gentle 
color. Surprisingly, the season of softness allows for a variation that 
strongly emphasizes eyes with liner. Shiseido's Parisian artistic director, 
Serge Lutens, for example, is showing an obvious, dark liner on upper and lower 
lids with shadows that appear to lighten the lids slightly. Most American 
makeup artists, however, are featuring the look without liner, placing emphasis 
on lashes and brows. The eyebrows are left natural, yet tamed with new brow 
gels. Before mascara, lashes are softly curled; a new device called Lady Wink 
can be used as a cold or hot curler for long-lasting curve. 
</P>
<P>
TOUCHABLE HAIR AT ANY LENGTH 
</P>
<P>
THE NATURAL FREEDOM of very short or very long hair is an integral element of 
the soft spring look. Just as designers of beauty products are operating on the 
theory that a woman's makeup should not be noticeable, many hairdressers are 
likewise saying that the healthy glow of the hair -- rather than the style -- 
is what's fashionable. Geometrically structured haircuts -- such as the sharply 
chiseled bob -- have become passe. And now more than ever, black and Asian 
women will not alter their natural hair with gels and texturizers to conform to 
a largely Caucasian ideal. The point of the natural look in hair is to call 
attention to the eyes, an effect achieved by dense bangs, which skim the 
eyebrows, as well as hair brushed back and off the face. Long hair -- straight, 
waved or curly -- can be worn free-flowing. Or the hair can be pulled back into 
a chignon or ponytail to completely free the face of clutter. 
</P>
<P>
"Short" this spring means hair cut no longer than earlobe length. If the style 
is a blunt page boy, hair should just graze the earlobes. Even newer is hair 
cropped to within an inch of its roots. This is "no-conflict" hair -- tresses 
snipped into shape, then left to their own devices, framing the face rather 
than being noticed on their own. Sterfon Demings, educational director of the 
John Atchison salons in New York and Los Angeles, says that one of the most 
important aspects of the short style that he created, at left, is that it is a 
"low- to no-maintenance look. Women have better things to do with their time 
than worry about their hair." 
</P>
<P>
NEW TREATMENTS FOR 'NATURAL' SKIN 
</P>
<P>
UNDER THIS SEASON'Ssheer makeup foundations and delicate, iridescent powders, 
the natural textures and tones of the skin are not hidden. Therefore, the 
newest treatment products are designed to make skin look very refined and 
flawless. But since consumers spend $3 billion annually on skin-care products, 
the Food and Drug Administration is constantly reminding the cosmetics industry 
that product promises of wrinkle-free, blemish-free skin won't be tolerated. In 
response, in April, Ultima II will release The Moisturizer, an emollient cream 
for which the only claim made is that it will be regularly reformulated to keep 
up with changing technology. Consumers are left to draw their own conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
A large number of other moisturizing formulas will be released this season. The 
impetus has come from the fact that the 30- to 40-plus crowd -- who now spend 
the most money on cosmetics -- are developing wrinkles. (Fine lines can be 
attributed to surface dryness, but deeper wrinkles are typically caused by 
aging and can't be helped by moisturizers.) While most exfoliating products 
tend to dry the skin while helping to refine the surface texture, Dior's new 
Exfoliant Rose, a gel with grains encapsulated in oils, is intended to 
lubricate as it exfoliates. Lancome's Hydra-Bleu Cool Hydrating Masque and 
Princess Marcella Borghese's Cura Natura -- which looks like green caviar -- 
are other new products purported to restore moisture to the surface of the 
skin. For oily skin, Max Factor offers the clay-based Incredible Blue Mask, 
which changes color as excess oils are absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
SPRING SIGNALS A NEW, LIGHTER APPROACH TO FRAGRANCE 
</P>
<P>
VIRTUALLY EVERY scent introduced for spring emphasizes subtlety. Advertisements 
for Red, the new fragrance from the makers of heady Giorgio, declare that 
"nothing so soft was ever so exciting." Christian Dior, which introduced 
powerful Poison perfume two years ago, now produces Soft Poison, a "light 
cologne" version of the very successful original. Fred Hayman's 273, developed 
by the former owner of Giorgio, is much more understated than his potent debut 
fragrance. And Listen, the first fragrance put out by music-industry mogul Herb 
Alpert, blends delicate notes of muguet with lemon and bergamot. Following a 
successful test run in Southern California that began in October, the scent, 
which a Listen representative describes as "whisper soft," will be launched 
nationally in spring. 
</P>
<P>
Even the House of Guerlain, which is probably best known for its intensely 
sensual scent, Shalimar, is launching a new soft perfume in Paris in June. The 
name, as yet undisclosed, will reflect the newly rediscovered virtues of 
low-key essences. 
</P>
<P>
Just as there is a trend toward subtle lip and eye color that recalls elements 
of the natural look in '60s makeup, there is a renaissance of lighter 
fragrances with obviously natural notes -- lily, lemon and herbal aromas, among 
them -- that also were popular in that decade. The big difference now is that 
the new soft scents are among the most costly perfumes, and major companies are 
marketing them to an upscale audience. In contrast, many of the lighter scents 
of the '60s and early '70s were inexpensive fad items, aimed predominantly at 
the youth market. 
</P>
<P>
When New York City's Bloomingdale's begins its tribute to California fashion 
designers and beauty products in April, it will introduce a new Max Factor 
fragrance, Jaclyn Smith's California, an ultra-soft scent that joins the 
celebrity-signature fragrance category. The Smith fragrance will be available 
to the rest of the country -- including California -- in July. Before the 
scent's development, consumers surveyed by Factor reported that they were tired 
of heavy fragrances and wanted a "soft and light scent." Further, they 
described the former "Charlie's Angels" star as "soft and feminine," according 
to Sharon LeVan, Max Factor's senior vice president of marketing. Thus consumer 
opinion directly influenced the softness trend. 
</P>
<P>
The question remains, however: Will women respond at the cash register to 
beauty's new soft wares? Will sales of red lipsticks and aggressive fragrances 
fall as consumer taste shifts to pale shades and mellow smells? Retailers are 
optimistic. Gary Cockrell, cosmetics buyer for both I. Magnin and Bullocks 
Wilshire stores, explains that the soft approach in beauty and fragrance is a 
result of a growing self-confidence among women. "Pale cosmetics are for a 
woman who is sure of herself and who is sophisticated enough to appreciate her 
own beauty," he says. Michael Ziegler, senior vice president and general 
merchandising manager of cosmetics at Robinson's, concurs, noting that he sees 
the season's soft, natural look "as a form of enhancement, rather than an 
attempt to change the way a woman looks. Will women here go for it? Why not? 
Isn't it very much a California thing to do?"

Weird but true: "21 Jump Street" heartthrob Johnny Depp will team with quirky 
film maker John Waters ("Pink Flamingos," "Hairspray") -- for the musical love 
story "Cry Baby." 
</P>
<P>
A spoof of '50s-era JD (that's juvenile delinquent) flicks, it's for Imagine 
Entertainment/Universal. Waters will write and direct with Rachel Talalay 
producing. 
</P>
<P>
Depp will play a gang member who gets his "Cry Baby" nickname when he's spotted 
shedding a single tear. The pic boasts more than 30 tunes, but Depp may or may 
not sing. His spokesman reminded, "Johnny broke in as a singer-musician," 
playing clubs on the Sunset Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Filming is set for Waters' Baltimore stomping ground in mid-April. That's 
hiatus time for Depp from his work as a sexy undercover cop on "Jump Street," 
where he's emerged as the hot star at age 25. 
</P>
<P>
But some film offers will have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
"When this season ends," said a Fox TV spokesman, "Johnny Depp's contract 
continues for three more years."

Has Spike Lee, renegade director of "She's Gotta Have It" and "School Daze," 
sold out? The young, hip film maker is not only pitching Nike shoes in TV spots 
that co-star NBA superstar Michael Jordan, he's modeling fashion apparel in the 
current Vanity Fair (for the Gap) and in Spy magazine (for the Gotham-based 
Barney's chain). 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I don't do everything," Lee said from N.Y.C., where he's finishing his 
new film, "Do The Right Thing," due this summer from Universal. "I've turned 
down lots of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Among the rejectees: Miller Lite ("I just don't feel comfortable doing liquor 
ads"). 
</P>
<P>
Lee doesn't think the endorsements have damaged his credibility. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you turn down an ad where you get to stand next to Michael Jordan? I'm 
not getting rich off this stuff -- none of these have exactly been $8-million 
Pepsi deals. In fact, I'm giving all the money I got from this Barney's ad to 
charity. All I'm getting is the Armani suit." 
</P>
<P>
He laughed. "I think this is good for my credibility. No one's ever seen me in 
a suit before!" Patrick Goldstein

"The Manchurian Candidate," director John Frankenheimer's 1962 thriller about 
an American serviceman turned into a political assassin through Communist 
brainwashing, may still be too controversial for network viewing. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Sinatra, who starred and controls distribution rights, took the 
critically praised film off the market after the assassination of John F. 
Kennedy in 1963, re-releasing it theatrically and in video last year. The film 
grossed $2.72 million in its limited reissue; video sales totaled $2.5 million.

Nonetheless, Norman Horowitz, MGM-UA Telecommunications prez, tells us all 
three networks have passed on broadcast rights. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't feel it was appropriate for prime time," Horowitz said. "We're 
going to try to sell it to independent stations now." 
</P>
<P>
The film's age and the fact that it was shot in black and white could have been 
factors in the networks' decision to pass on it. But Frankenheimer said network 
execs have told him his film will always be "too hot" for prime-time viewing. 
</P>
<P>
"(The rejection) has to be for its political content," Frankenheimer insisted. 
"There's no other reason. . . . I consider it a compliment to the movie, 
because (that means) it still holds up after all these years." Craig Modderno

Maverick film maker Robert Altman will go to Italy this fall to shoot his next 
project, a biography of 19th-Century Italian composer Gioacchino Rossini, whom 
Altman calls "the Mick Jagger of his day." 
</P>
<P>
"He was enormously successful, popular and sexy," Altman told us. "Yet, in his 
mid-30s, he decided to stop writing music and travel and experience life." 
Altman will focus his English-language film on that period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Enrico Roseo is producing, and "there's not one penny of American money in it," 
Altman added. Leonard Klady

Regarding "George Burns: Golden Oldie" (by Margy Rochlin, Jan. 8): I have been 
a fan of George Burns since his radio days, and I love him as much as anyone 
else and admire and envy his longevity. However, I am a junior high health 
teacher who teaches an extensive unit on drug abuse. I am glad to see Burns 
question how John Lennon could be a drug user; he can't see how anyone for 
whatever reasons would use drugs. What he fails to see (and most people do), 
though, is the hypocrisy of condemning "drug" use when he admits to using two 
of the most abused substances -- nicotine (20 cigars) and alcohol (at least six 
drinks daily). There is no difference between these drugs and the drugs Lennon 
used. But with the mentality that alcohol is not a drug, Burns will never 
believe this.

The article sends a mixed message.

ANGELS AMONG US

<TEXT>
<P>
With reference to David DeVoss' otherwise flawless piece: "Angels Among Us: 
Nine Tireless Southern Californians and Their Quiet Generosity" (Dec. 18/25), 
there is only one word that I would question. The word sacrifice, which appears 
on the table of contents. I don't think any of these remarkable people consider 
that they "sacrifice their time for others." It is apparent that they are doing 
what they are doing for the sheer love of it, without expecting anything in 
return. These dedicated folks are, in effect, pros in the art of living. Their 
faces display smiles, kindness, serenity, a joy of living that so many search 
for and never attain. And, in the process, they're having fun.

After reading George Burns' story, one wonders what his secret is. He smokes 
constantly and drinks, does everything in direct opposition to so-called health 
habits. But he's thriving at 93! Maybe he really is God!

POP EYE: RAY CHARLES' LIFE TO GET THE HOLLYWOOD TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood has rock 'n' roll fever. 
</P>
<P>
Tinseltown has already made "The Buddy Holly Story," immortalized the King 
("This Is Elvis"), documented Chuck Berry's life ("Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll") 
and rediscovered Richie Valens ("La Bamba"). This summer Orion Pictures will 
celebrate The Killer, with Dennis Quaid starring as Jerry Lee Lewis in "Great 
Balls of Fire." 
</P>
<P>
Who's next? A few hints: He's black. He's blind. He's a dynamic keyboardist and 
sensual singer who's had dozens of Top 40 hits. 
</P>
<P>
If you guessed Stevie Wonder, you're . . . wrong. 
</P>
<P>
It's none other than Ray Charles. The R&amp;B legend's life and music will be 
dramatized in "The Ray Charles Story," a just-announced film project being 
produced by rock managers Mark Hartley and Larry Fitzgerald. The film is the 
first project due from New Visions Pictures, a new production company headed by 
Taylor Hackford, who says his production slate will offer "at least one" music 
biography each year. (New Visions has acquired the rights to the life of Linda 
Creed, an influential '70s-era black songwriter.) 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted our first New Visions picture to really stand out," explained 
Hackford, a pop aficionado who produced "La Bamba" and directed "Hail! Hail! 
Rock 'n' Roll." "To me, Ray Charles is the greatest living figure in black 
music. His music is the meeting place of R&amp;B, rock, pop, jazz and country 
&amp; Western. He's a wonderfully complex character, a guy born into awful 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
"Ray struggled against unbelievable odds to become one of the major pop music 
icons of the last four decades. And to me, there's something inherently 
dramatic about the distance one travels in American society -- and Ray went all 
the way." 
</P>
<P>
Though Charles experienced many traumas along the way, including a period of 
heroin addiction, Hackford insists none of the rough spots will be smoothed 
over. "We're telling the whole story -- the tragedies and the triumphs. Ray 
doesn't want anything covered up." 
</P>
<P>
No writer or director has been chosen yet. But Quincy Jones -- an old Charles 
associate -- will be on board as a musical consultant. Hackford says he's 
looking for several unknown actors to play Charles at various stages of his 
career. As for the music, Hackford says it will probably be a combination of 
old material and re-recordings. "I'm certainly not going to re-record Ray's 
voice," he said. "No one sounds like him -- and no one ever will."

Twenty years after "Tommy," Pete Townshend is finishing work on a concept album 
based on the children's story, "Iron Man." It stars blues great John Lee Hooker 
as the title character (he eats iron in a junkyard) with Townshend on hand and 
Nina Simone in a supporting role. . . . It's always a joy to hear a songwriter 
describe the ideas behind his new material -- especially if he has the vivid 
imagination of XTC's Andy Partridge. Asked how he wrote "Here Comes President 
Kil Again," a song from the group's tart new "Oranges and Lemons" album, 
Partridge explained: "When I walk the dog, I get ideas, and the pace I walk 
determines the tempo of the song." . . . Meanwhile, the Cult is due back in 
April with a new album called "Sonic Temple." Produced by Bob Rock (who's 
worked with Bon Jovi and Kingdom Come), it features "Edie (Ciao Baby)," (a 
tribute to Warhol-protegeEdie Sedgwick), "American Horse," "Fire Women," "Soul 
Asylum" and "Sun King." . . . Harp magic man Lazy Lester has a new album out 
from Alligator Records called "Harp and Soul," featuring such blues gems as 
"Five Long Years," "I'm Your Man" and "Alligator Shuffle." He's also due in 
town Saturday night heading a blues bill at the Music Machine. . . . And a host 
of local bands will perform at a benefit Wednesday at the Palace for veteran 
roadie Kent Symthe, who lost a leg in a severe motorcycle crash in November. 
Performers will include Belinda Carlisle, Redd Kross, the Pandoras, TSOL and 
the Lame Flames (with members of Guns N' Roses).

POP EYE: SOUND TRACK FEVER

If you've read most of the movie reviews, you know how vital it is to avoid -- 
at all costs -- the hopelessly dumb "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventures." On 
the other hand, the film's sound track is a delight, especially for hard-rock 
fans who'll appreciate such high decibel rockers as Shark Island's "Father 
Time," Extreme's "Play With Me" and Vital Signs' "The Boys and Girls Are Doing 
It." Oddly enough, the record's most infectious potential single is "In Time," 
an ear-catching ballad performed by Robbie Robb. It's especially ear-catching 
if you've just listened to U-2's "With or Without You." We couldn't help but 
notice a curious resemblance, especially in the lilting melody and ringing 
guitar-chord departments. Think Bono would agree? . . . If they gave Grammy 
nods to reggae sound tracks, the year's most adventuresome entry would be the 
music to "The Mighty Quinn," the upcoming thriller starring Denzel Washington 
and Robert Townshend. Due out from A&amp;M Records, the sound track features "I 
Gotta Keep Moving On" by UB-40, "Groove Master" by Arrow, "Giving/Sharing" by 
Half Pint and "Send Fi Spanish Fly" by Little Twitch. The title cut, performed 
by Sheryl Lee Ralph with Cedella Marley and Sharon Marley Prendergast (both Bob 
Marley daughters), has new lyrics rewritten (with Bob Dylan's permission) to 
fit the plot of the film. . . . And thanks to Rhino Records, a classic live 
double album -- "The New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival 1976" -- is back 
in print. Available in all formats, it offers performances by Allen Toussaint, 
Lee Dorsey, Ernie K-Doe, Irma Thomas and Professor Longhair.

Paul McCartney's rock oldies collection isn't the only new album Russian fans 
will hear before it reaches American stores. "Rainbow Warriors," the upcoming 
Greenpeace compilation of rock hits, is due out in the Soviet Union early next 
month. To herald the event, a platoon of popsters will host a Moscow media 
event March 6, highlighted by the obligatory press conference, a record signing 
event at Melodiya (Moscow's answer to Tower Records) and an evening at the 
Bolshoi Ballet. So far, the rock contingent includes Chrissie Hynde, 
Eurythmics' Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart, Peter Gabriel, U-2's the Edge, David 
Byrne and Jerry Harrison, World Party's Karl Wallinger and the Thompson Twins. 
Soviet TV also will air a video promoting Greenpeace and the album, complete 
with an introduction by Lennox warning of mankind's continuing destruction of 
our global resources. The album will be released here April 17, with profits 
divided between Greenpeace (the most potent international environmental 
pressure group) and the International Foundation for the Survival and 
Development of Humanity.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / IRWIN L. KELLNER: CAN OUR LONG EXPANSION ROLL A 7? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRWIN L. KELLNER, IRWIN L. KELLNER is chief economist at Manufacturers 
Hanover in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not long ago, the economic expansion celebrated its sixth birthday. It was a 
significant event because the U.S. economy had never grown for six straight 
years without the help of a war. Indeed, if the expansion continues through the 
summer, it will become the second longest ever, surpassing the 80-month upswing 
that occurred during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that, over the past 130 years, a recession has struck once 
every 4.3 years, it would seem that the chances of this expansion lasting much 
longer are remote. Or are they? History may teach us some valuable lessons, but 
it doesn't necessarily impose ironclad rules on us when it comes to the 
inevitability of recessions. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that the natural tendency of the U.S. economy is growth. The 
population is constantly expanding; education and technology are always 
boosting productivity, and people's natural aspirations are to improve their 
living standards. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind, also, the fact that recessions don't come from outer space, from 
the weather, or from deep within the Earth. They are caused by policy makers, 
reacting to fears that this natural tendency toward growth at times can lead to 
overheating, thus to an upsurge in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
When demand for goods and services outpaces supply, as it does from time to 
time, prices will rise. This may also coincide with other inflation-generating 
developments, such as bad weather affecting crops, strikes, wars and so on. The 
end result: a big run-up in 
</P>
<P>
prices and a clampdown by the monetary and fiscal authorities to keep inflation 
from getting out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
In the past this restraint has come in the form of tax hikes, spending 
cutbacks, a reduction in the money supply and sharply rising interest rates. Of 
course, the intent was to slow down demand, thus dampening price pressures. 
Sometimes demand slowed -- but still expanded -- and sometimes it actually 
contracted. When it declined, we experienced a recession. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy has managed to avoid a full-fledged recession for more than 
six years because of an unusual set of developments: 
</P>
<P>
The last recession was so long and so deep that it left the economy with plenty 
of room to grow, in the form of unused capacity, vacant space and unemployed 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the expansion, the dollar shot up in foreign exchange markets, 
dampening domestic price pressures, while at the same time forcing U.S. 
businesses to spend heavily on new machinery, computers, etc., to remain 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Labor restrained its wage demands because of competition from abroad, as well 
as widespread domestic corporate restructurings. The surge in new machinery put 
in place boosted productivity, putting even more downward pressure on unit 
labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices began falling around the end of 1985, further dampening price 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market's crash of October, 1987, ironically gave the expansion 
another lease on life by cooling things off, allowing the Federal Reserve to 
push interest rates lower, at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
While capacity may be snug in some industries, consumer spending has tapered 
off at the same time, reflecting satisfied demands, a need to rebuild savings 
and to service relatively high debt loads. 
</P>
<P>
After falling for three years, the dollar stabilized in 1988, taking pressure 
off inflation from the standpoint of rising prices of imports as well as from 
too strong exports. 
</P>
<P>
Having said all this, can we now expect to set more records for this expansion? 
Or have we just about run out of luck when it comes to inflation-retarding 
developments? 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, things seem to be getting out of balance. We are still consuming 
more than we are producing, as evidenced by the deficits in both our domestic 
budget and in our trade balance with other countries. This is being only partly 
offset by the reluctance of the Fed to provide enough money to satisfy all 
these demands: Short-term interest rates rose nearly three percentage points in 
1988 alone while long-term yields climbed about three-quarters of a point. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the economy is apparently growing fast enough to generate a rise 
in the rate of inflation. In the past 12 months, the consumer price index has 
risen almost 5%, compared to 4.4% in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
To keep the economy from getting further out of balance, we must bring 
consumption and production into closer alignment. This will permit the Fed to 
relax its grip on the supply of money and credit, enabling interest rates to 
fall. Lower interest rates are the key to maintaining economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
It is to be hoped that the new President and the new Congress will be able to 
come up with a plan to reduce Washington's budget deficit. For when you talk 
about bringing consumption and production closer together, the buck starts 
here. 
</P>

IRKED BY HIGH AIR FARES? TAKE FREEWAY TO S.F. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Feb. 13 story, "Firms looking for Alternatives on L.A.-S.F. Run," missed 
the most obvious alternative, Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
I started flying regularly to Southern California in 1985 when the air fares 
dropped to $29 between San Jose and LAX because of a promotion started by 
Continental Airlines. But since every major airline matched Continental's fare 
and consumers showed Continental no preference, Continental was unable to 
maintain the volume needed to sustain such a low fare. 
</P>
<P>
As fares to LAX gradually rose, I started driving to Los Angeles more 
frequently. When the speed limit was 55 miles per hour, this drive was tedious, 
but since the 65 m.p.h. limit was established, it is tolerable. Catering trucks 
at rest stops offer refreshment and snacks to break the monotony. A trip from 
my home in Fremont to Wilshire and La Brea usually takes 5 1/2 hours. Counting 
airport time and car rentals, flying takes only one hour less! 
</P>
<P>
If our state government in Sacramento is concerned about high intrastate air 
fares harming commerce within California, it should consider raising the speed 
limit on I-5 to the limit that highway was initially designed for. Business 
travelers using I-5 will reduce demand for air travel and fares will drop 
correspondingly.

RACISM IN INVESTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding James Flanigan's Jan. 29 column, "Best Foreign Buyout Policy Is 
Self-Interest": 
</P>
<P>
Flanigan's comment on Japanese officials' puzzlement over the clamor that their 
nation's investments arouse in this country, even though they are dwarfed by 
British investments, is rather naive. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, even Dutch investment in the United States is greater than 
Japanese investment, and the Swiss are not far behind. What is different about 
Japanese investment and the reason it arouses the media and Congress is simply 
because it is the first nation of color that is making any kind of inroads in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the British invested 2 1/2 times as much as the Japanese last 
year would probably surprise nearly everybody. But it's no big deal with the 
media because, after all, they are the mother country. Likewise when any other 
white majority nation invests heavily here: It is ho-hum time. 
</P>
<P>
I am sensitive to the issue of Japan-bashing because I have learned from bitter 
experience that as favorable sentiment toward Japan diminishes, the rising 
resentment is easily transferred to Japanese-Americans as well. The point I am 
trying to make is that if one peels away all the furor and arguments about 
Japanese trade and investment, one will find racism at the core. Think about 
it.

IRKED BY HIGH AIR FARES? TAKE FREEWAY TO S.F. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are two sensible solutions to the outrageous Los Angeles-San Francisco 
air fares: 
</P>
<P>
First, have the municipally owned airports in the Los Angeles basin reserve 
gate positions for air services offering low fares on this route. This offers 
an opportunity for new intrastate operators. 
</P>
<P>
Second, authorize state-backed bonds for a modern, high-speed rail line linking 
the Bay Area and Los Angeles via the San Joaquin Valley and over the 
Tehachapis. (Surely modern engineering can conquer those brutes!) If the French 
and Germans can do it, so can we -- three-hour trips, some also carrying autos. 
No airport hassles or freeway jangles -- and lower fares.

ERMA BOMBECK: RESISTING THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE: MICRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erma Bombeck 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have always fought progress, change and vision. This is because progress, 
change and vision always come with a manual. On my husband's last birthday, I 
presented him with a microwave oven so he could heat up the milk for his coffee 
without scorching every pan in the house. It came with a manual that could have 
been made into an eight-hour miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
Leafing through the book of instructions, I came across the chapter on how to 
replace the light bulb in your microwave. It gave new meaning to the old joke, 
"How many (fill in your own group) does it take to replace a light bulb?" In 
this case, the answer came to two nuclear physicists, one man with asbestos 
hands and an authorized service representative who would determine the bulb's 
availability. 
</P>
<P>
There was an entire chapter devoted to "probe cooking." I had never 
probe-cooked before. (Or is it cooked probe before?) There was a series of 
graphics that outlined the "control panel," and a few words leapt off the pages 
-- "burn risk," "electric shock," "injury to persons," and "excessive microwave 
energy." Cher in "Silkwood" came to mind. 
</P>
<P>
Even if I had had the patience to read the entire manual, I knew I'd be so 
intimidated, I'd just use the oven to store bread and crackers. The decision 
was made to fake it. Using a microwave without directions is like parallel 
parking a tank without a license. 
</P>
<P>
I have paid an exorbitant price for my stubbornness. Did you know that a bagel 
left in a microwave a mere two seconds longer than it should can pull out the 
entire top row of your teeth when you bite into it? Or that a whole egg left to 
hard-boil will detonate after a while? When all the water boils out of a coffee 
mug, the mug will likewise explode like a land mine. 
</P>
<P>
And here's an interesting phenomenon: If you keep cooking bacon until it gets 
"real crispy," it will eventually melt down, and you will have to suck the 
flavor out of the paper towel. 
</P>
<P>
It is ludicrous to read microwave instructions on the boxes of food you buy, as 
each one will have a disclaimer: THIS WILL VARY WITH YOUR MICROWAVE. Loosely 
translated, this means, "You're on your own, Bernice." 
</P>
<P>
I guess I'm inspired by the millions of children in this country who can 
operate a microwave before they know how to read. They eventually rise above a 
warmed-over pizza that comes out like a Ping-Pong paddle with pepperoni. 
</P>
<P>
A child was visiting the other day and asked: "Mrs. Bombeck, the clock on your 
microwave is blinking. Want me to set it for you?" 
</P>
<P>
I lifted him off the floor so he could reach it. He was small for 4.

This week Ambassador to Finland Rockwell A. Schnabel of Los Angeles received 
the Grand Cross of the Order of the Lion of Finland from the president of 
Finland, Dr. Mauno Koivisto, at a farewell luncheon hosted by the president and 
Mrs. Koivisto for the ambassador and his wife, Marna, at the presidential 
Palace in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
The decoration is rarely awarded to a foreigner, and Schnabel becomes the first 
U.S. ambassador to receive the order from President Koivisto. Now, after three 
years as the U.S. envoy to Finland, the Schnables (who are building a Frank 
Gehry house in Brentwood) move to Washington to "join the Bush team." 
</P>

WAR AND REMEMBRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many thanks to Bob Sipchen for his article on those of us who still wear our 
MIA bracelets ("A Reminder of Vietnam . . .," Feb. 13). It was very encouraging 
to learn that I was not the only one still wearing mine. 
</P>
<P>
Mine says "PFC TIMOTHY OWEN, 6/29/68." I have worn this bracelet for him since 
August, 1968. It never fails to cause wistful comment wherever I go. And to all 
those who ask why I still wear it, I patiently explain that he is one of those 
2,500 still listed as missing, and that I will wear it for him until they find 
him. Period. (No, I do not know him personally.) 
</P>
<P>
I have had to have it welded back together when it snapped in two from wear, 
and I have had to have it coated with silver when it turned black from 
exposure. But wear it I will until he comes back. As an American, it is the 
least of what I owe him.

ON AGING: A FEW TIPS FOR PLAYING GOLF LONGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By The UCLA/USC Long-Term Care Gerontology Center

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I play golf in my Northeast hometown during the milder months and in 
Florida during the winter. Any tips for maximizing my enjoyment of the game? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: To prolong your golfing life expectancy regardless of age, experts 
recommend giving yourself enough time to fully complete your backswing. And to 
help maintain agility in your legs, walk when you play rather than riding in a 
cart. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher and senior-tour pro Bob Toski offers the following pointers for a 
longer, more successful golf life: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keep your grip pressure light. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Relax your arms at address so they can rotate freely in a full swing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Set your weight predominantly on the right side to give you more time to 
shift to the left for maximum power (opposite for a left-hander). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stay light on your feet. 
</P>
<P>
Q: A while back there was a lot of hoopla about "notch babies" not getting 
their full Social Security entitlements. Since I'm an individual in this 
category, I'm wondering whether a solution was found to resolve the inequity. 
</P>
<P>
A: At this time, the "solution" is to maintain the status quo. A recent study 
by the National Academy of Social Insurance recommended that Congress neither 
reduce benefits to those getting the unintended windfall nor raise them for 
everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
The report focused on a category of Social Security recipients known as "notch 
babies," born between 1917 and 1921. Their benefits in some cases were $200 a 
month less than those of people born earlier. The inequity lies in the fact 
that those born before 1917 are getting higher benefits than Congress intended, 
not that others are receiving too little. An estimated 1 million people 
affected by the benefits notch feel a "substantial impact" from the situation. 
</P>
<P>
The discrepancy in benefits arose when Congress adopted a new formula meant to 
keep Social Security benefits at a constant percentage of a person's average 
pre-retirement earnings. People born before 1917 were allowed to use the old 
method of calculation. The result was a benefit rate that peaked in 1981 at 56% 
of average earnings, about 15 percentage points higher than Congress had 
intended. 
</P>
<P>
Why not fix the inequity? The study panel estimated that it would cost up to 
$300 billion to equalize everyone's benefits, and that would create new notches 
affecting those born in later years. Also, it would be difficult and expensive 
to find those who got windfalls and politically difficult to cut their 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The heartening news for those born between 1917 and 1921: The report concluded 
they are at an advantage compared with people born after them.

ROCKWELL CHIEF WINS TOP ENGINEER'S AWARD; 
</P>
<P>
3 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PROJECTS ALSO HONORED DURING ANNUAL OBSERVANCE OF 
ENGINEERS WEEK

<P>
Los Angeles' observance of National Engineers Week, which coincides yearly with 
the birth date of George Washington, culminated with the awarding of honors and 
citations last week for engineering achievements and commemoration of two 
milestone events. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, engineers drew praise for their profession from President Bush, who 
stated that "America's engineers have always played a vitally important role in 
developing America's way of life and standards of living. 
</P>
<P>
"From constructing bridges and highways to exploring the vast earth beneath us, 
American engineers are helping America to keep America moving and safe." 
</P>
<P>
The observance, initiated in 1951 by the National Society of Professional 
Engineers, also honors the first President as a surveyor and military and 
agricultural engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, a weeklong series of events culminated with a presentation of awards 
for outstanding engineering events from the past year, with participation by 
local societies under the co-sponsorship of Institute for the Advancement of 
Engineering and the American Society of Civil Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Made Major Contributions 
</P>
<P>
Donald R. Beall, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Rockwell 
International Corp., El Segundo, received the George Washington Award for 
"Engineer of the Year, Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
As a key executive of one of the nation's largest technological organizations, 
Beall has made major contributions to the advancement of space flight, advanced 
aircraft design and the development of sophisticated systems. 
</P>
<P>
A practicing engineer, Beall has applied his skills to a wide range of 
programs, including the space shuttle, B-1 bomber, Peacekeeper intercontinental 
ballistic missile, Freedom (space) Station, and satellites. He also served as 
chairman of the Aerospace Industry Assn. during 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Three projects were chosen by the institute to receive Engineering Project 
Achievement Awards: 
</P>
<P>
Intermodal Container Transfer Facility, the world's largest computerized 
container transfer yard for international cargo, was developed with the Ports 
of Los Angeles and Long Beach under a joint powers authority and operated by 
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saves on Oil 
</P>
<P>
Kern County Cogeneration Project, near Bakersfield, the largest grass-roots 
co-generation plant in the United States, produces a net saving of 7,500 
barrels per day of crude oil compared to the system it replaced, and produces 
enough electricity for half a million households. It is a joint venture of 
Southern California Edison's Kern River Cogeneration Co. and Texaco Inc.; Fluor 
Daniel Inc. of Irvine has turnkey responsibility for the energy enhancement 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Ultra High Bypass Demonstrator, a company-owned Douglas MD-80 aircraft, has 
been equipped with advanced-technology propulsion systems, a major breakthrough 
in aviation efficiency developed by McDonnell Douglas Corp., Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Distinguished Engineering Achievement merit awards were presented to Robert S. 
Horii, city engineer of Los Angeles and to William B. Johnson, automation 
consultant for Rocketdyne division of Rockwell International, Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
Resolutions also honored the following for community service achievements: 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jacki Bacharach of Rancho Palos Verdes; Albert L. Baietti, ICN 
Biomedicals Inc., Irvine; James F. Foxworthy, professor of civil engineering, 
Loyola-Marymount University; Dale B. Hartman, executive director, Institute for 
Manufacturing and Automation Research, Los Angeles; Jim C. Hoover, vice

STATE HAS THIRD OF TOP BUILDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of the top 100 home builders in the United States in 1988, 32 are based in 
California, more than any other state, according to Professional Builder 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Texas, with 14 on the list, ranked second, while Florida was third, with 10. No 
other state is home to more than five of the most active builders, according to 
James Carper, the magazine's managing editor. 
</P>
<P>
Privately held Trammell Crow Residential Cos., Dallas, was the most active 
builder last year, with 12,932 starts. Ryland Group Inc., Columbia, Md., in 
second place, with 9,795 starts, was the most active publicly held firm. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis Homes, Upland, was the most active California-based builder, ranking 12th 
last year, with 4,731 starts; William Lyon Co., Newport Beach, 13th, with 
4,581; A.G. Spanos Construction Inc., Stockton, 17th, with 3,569; the Anden 
Group, Sherman Oaks, 18th, with 3,443; Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp., Los 
Angeles, 20th, with 3,400; Robertson Homes, Stockton, 22nd, with 3,070 and 
Citation Builders, Tustin, 25th, with 2,900 starts.

HOT PROPERTY: STREISAND BUYING HOME ON HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was no truth that Barbra Streisand was planning to sell her Hollywood 
home and buy a mansion in London, we were told last fall, but there is lots of 
evidence now that the so-called "Duchess of Brooklyn" is buying British actor 
Richard Harris' Beverly Hills-area house. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Stills -- of the rock band Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young -- has been 
leasing Harris' house and was even interested in buying it himself, but 
Streisand apparently won out. Asking price was $7 million, but it's going for 
$5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Streisand still owns a Holmby Hills home and a Malibu residential compound, 
which was listed in June, 1987, at $18 million. Six months later, the price was 
raised to $19.5 million. It's still on the market. 
</P>
<P>
As for her new digs, they are on a promontory, consisting of nearly 6 acres. 
And there is talk that she may have the house demolished. 
</P>
<P>
Merv Griffin has been quietly looking for a buyer of his 157-acre mountaintop 
overlooking Beverly Hills, real estate sources say. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been trying to keep it low key," an agent who declined to be identified, 
said, "but when you're asking $25 million for anything, that's hard to keep low 
key." 
</P>
<P>
The property was once owned by Princess Shams, a sister of the late Shah of 
Iran. Griffin bought it with much fanfare in October, 1987. He has been having 
it graded for a 16-acre pad to accommodate a mansion designed by Waldo 
Fernandez. (The planned house grew in size from 25,000 to 58,000 square feet, 
at last count.) 
</P>
<P>
Griffin reportedly paid about $5.5 million for the property but has already had 
an offer of $18 million. 
</P>
<P>
Why the talk-show host-turned-tycoon is selling remains, for the moment, a 
mystery. Perhaps the planned house was becoming more of a hotel, and he already 
owns (and is buying) several of those. Perhaps he needed more funds for his 
Trump deals and his hotel renovations. Or, maybe he planned all along to use 
the property strictly as an investment. 
</P>
<P>
"He possibly wants a little more liquidity," an agent speculated, "but he was 
willing to take back some secondary financing, so money doesn't appear to be 
the issue." Hopefully, we'll hear more from Merv, who was not available last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Petersen, who says he owns the world's largest collection of U.S. Patent 
Office models, has had samples in every room of his 15-room, 8,000-square-foot 
Beverly Hills home, but no more: 
</P>
<P>
He's shipping the 40,000 models to a New York warehouse he owns and is moving 
as fast as he can to a Hollywood Hills hideaway that he just bought. "The 
collection has taken over my life," he said. "I'm beginning to get intimidated, 
even by the house." 
</P>
<P>
He has lived in the house, built in 1911 as a wedding present for the daughter 
of Silsby Spalding (Beverly Hills' first mayor), for 25 years, but the home is 
now listed with Constance Chesnut and Cris Forrest (actor Steve Forrest's wife) 
at Jack Hupp &amp; Associates. Price: $6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The house might be torn down because it's on two lots," Hupp said, "but about 
half the people looking intend to restore it." 
</P>
<P>
The house next door is also on two lots, but its new owner, Georges Marciano 
(one of the two brothers who own Guess Jeans), has been restoring it. That 
house, much newer than Petersen's but of pre-World War II vintage, was owned by 
former talk-show host Mike Douglas before Marciano bought it for $7.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
As for the collection of patent models, Petersen hopes to sell it to an 
American museum or "someone with great resources who can take care of it," he 
said. "I had offers of $15 million, but I broke off negotiations because I 
didn't want to see a Japanese or Canadian buy it, though I have sold 45 models 
to a museum in south London." The collection has been valued at $17.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Klein, who made a fortune owning movie theaters before buying the San 
Diego Chargers and then training and racing such thoroughbreds as his "Winning 
Colors," has been developing homes with partner Guy Gardner at Del Rayo, 
Klein's Rancho Santa Fe project, for three years, but what Klein is doing now 
takes nerves that only a fellow like Klein could have: 
</P>
<P>
He's developing, on his own, eight houses averaging $6 million plus change, and 
he's doing it, though he hates the expression, "on spec." He doesn't say "on 
spec," because he figures that the houses are so fine they will sell with no 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Getting $6 million-plus for even one house without a specific buyer in mind 
seems riskier than any horse race, but Klein is confident he'll come out a 
winner. He bases this on what he deems is a need ("I know there is a great 
number of people moving to San Diego, looking for residences like these") and 
his knowledge of what goes into such houses. He has owned several mansions: a 
9,000-square-footer in Trousdale, a 16,000-square-footer behind the Beverly 
Hills Hotel, and, currently, an 18,000-square- footer in Rancho Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks Barton, a first vice president of Coldwell Banker (formerly western 
regional vice president of Previews), says his firm has just formed an 
exclusive agreement with Citibank's Asian Bank Division to represent Citibank's 
Asian clients who are shopping for real estate in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"This is interesting," Barton said from his Santa Barbara office, "because we 
will bring in a lot of large buyers who are pre-qualified by the bank." By 
"large," Barton means he will work with clients who are pre-qualified to buy 
residential properties, even single-family homes, for as much as $50 million 
each.

EXPANDED SECTION, NEW EDITOR TO DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Times Real Estate Editor Dick Turpin, who began his journalism career nearly 
half a century ago and has edited the real estate section for more than two 
decades, is retiring Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Turpin will be succeeded by Dick Barnes, the city editor of The Times for the 
past five years. Barnes will oversee several changes in the section, including 
the introduction of color photography and a renewed focus on residential real 
estate in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Turpin, 69, started his career as a reporter for the now-defunct Burbank Daily 
Review in 1941. After serving in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1942 to 1945, he 
returned to the Daily Review and was appointed city editor in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
Turpin joined The Times in 1948 as a reporter and photographer. He was named 
its first education editor in 1957, a post he held for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
He was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1961 for a series of articles 
comparing American and Russian high school graduation exams, and was a member 
of the team of reporters whose coverage of the 1965 Watts riots and their 
aftermath won a Pulitzer for the newspaper in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Turpin was named real estate editor in 1967, charged with bringing editorial 
independence to a section that for years had been produced under the aegis of 
the advertising department. Under his leadership, the section was named best in 
the country three times by the National Assn. of Real Estate Editors and has 
consistently ranked in the top five. 
</P>
<P>
Turpin will continue to contribute to the real estate section. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes, 44, began his newspaper career in 1965 at the San Diego Union, where he 
worked as a reporter and editor. He joined The Times in 1972, and has worked as 
a copy editor, assistant foreign news editor and city editor of The Times' 
editions in San Diego, Orange County and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He left The Times in 1981 to become metropolitan editor of Times Mirror Co.'s 
Hartford (Conn.) Courant, a job he held until returning to The Times as city 
editor in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes, who will report to Associate Editor Jean Sharley Taylor, will oversee 
an expanded and redesigned real estate section, which will debut March 5. Using 
color photography on Page 1, the section will focus on news, features, trends 
and issues of residential real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Features on home improvement and gardening also will appear regularly, as will 
question-and-answer columns on real estate topics. Coverage of architecture and 
urban issues will be expanded, while coverage of commercial and industrial real 
estate will be enhanced and repackaged.

STATE CONSTRUCTION EXPECTED TO DECLINE FROM 1988 ACTIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Construction in the state was up in 1988 but will be down this year, according 
to the Construction Industry Research Board. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, construction totaled $44.88 billion, up 11.6% from 1987, adjusted for 
inflation. The 1989 forecast is for a decline of 12.5%, to $39.26 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The board said the 1988 increase was due, in part, to several large projects in 
the nonresidential and heavy construction sectors and high housing permit 
activity in areas where growth-control measures appeared on election ballots. 
</P>
<P>
The predicted decline in 1989 is seen as an adjustment following "unusually 
high" 1988 activity and as a reflection of anticipated increases in interest 
rates. Additionally, sewer capacity shortages in the Los Angeles area will 
restrict building. 
</P>
<P>
Construction employment averaged 607,000 in 1988, up 5.6% from 1987. A 0.5% is 
foreseen for 1989, mainly because of the time lag between building permit 
issuance, or contract award.

INLAND EMPIRE MARKET 10TH IN AFFORDABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Riverside-San Bernardino residential market ranked 10th among the nation's 
150 largest metropolitan areas during the fourth quarter of 1988 in 
affordability and resale activity, according to the new Merrill Lynch Realty 
index. 
</P>
<P>
Other Southern California areas and their rankings are: Oxnard-Ventura, 31; 
Anaheim-Santa Ana, 50; Los Angeles-Long Beach, 56 and Santa Barbara, 143. 
</P>
<P>
The survey defined "affordability" as a composite of average household income, 
the mean price of an existing single family house, and local mortgage interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
Houston ranked first in the survey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Riverside Up 9.6% 
</P>
<P>
Riverside scored well, the survey said, because the average annual household 
income of $45,100 was above the $42,104 needed to qualify for an 80% loan on 
the average house in the area. In Houston, the average annual household income 
was $55,200 and the income necessary to qualify was $24,792. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional benchmark is that the annual mortgage payment cannot be more 
than 28% of household income. 
</P>
<P>
The survey said that during 1989, the mean sales price of an existing Riverside 
house will increase about 9.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard-Ventura scored well on affordability because the average household 
income of $56,200 was above the $48,542 needed to quality for a mortgage. 
During 1989, the mean price of an existing house will increase about 8.1%, the 
survey said. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim-Santa Ana market ranked first among all 150 markets surveyed in 
terms of the percent change in resales from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the 
fourth quarter of 1988. Sales of existing detached houses were 30,000, up 37.3% 
from 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The mean price of an existing house in this market will increase about 7.9% the 
survey said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
L.A. Affordability 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles did not score well on affordability because the average annual 
household income of $52,700 was below the $66,892 needed to quality for a 
mortgage. The survey forecast that during 1989, the mean price of an existing 
house will increase about 7.9% 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara did not score well on affordability either, because the average 
household income of $54,200 was below the $72,502 needed to qualify on a 
mortgage. The mean price of an existing house will increase about 7.9%, the 
survey said.

INSURANCE AND REAL ESTATE; 
</P>
<P>
TENANTS' POLICIES ALSO PROTECT THE LANDLORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURTIS B. SMITH, Curtis B. Smith is a multiple-line insurance agent in the 
West Los Angeles area. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commercial landlords usually require their tenants to carry adequate liability 
insurance. This protects them from financial loss resulting from third-party 
claims against acts of tenants or damage tenants cause to the premises (e.g. 
fire or vandalism). 
</P>
<P>
Tenants' liability coverage also protects the owner's insurance companies from 
having to pay for losses caused by tenants and reduces the owner's risk of 
insurance cancellation or premium increase due to excessive claims. 
</P>
<P>
Residential leases do not usually require tenants to maintain liability 
insurance. This is a serious oversight, because owners of residential buildings 
are at just as much risk of liability losses as owners of commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent case, a tenant's dog allegedly bit someone while the tenant was 
walking it several blocks from his apartment. The tenant did not have tenant 
homeowner's insurance, which would have provided liability protection. 
</P>
<P>
The injured party sued the building owner as well as the tenant because the 
owner and his liability insurance represented the only realistic means of 
recovering damages. The case was settled out of court, but as a result of the 
claim being filed, the owner had an increased risk that his insurance premium 
might be raised or the policy canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Protect yourself and your assets. Require residential tenants to purchase and 
maintain adequate liability insurance. And, make sure you are named as an 
additional insured with notice of cancellation so that if your tenants let 
their policies lapse, you will be given advance notice.

REAGAN DUE KUDOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I glanced at Sam Hall Kaplan's diatribe column on the Reagans (Jan. 22), I 
discarded it as so much piffle. 
</P>
<P>
Then, I saw the bundle of letters from those fluffy heads who seemed to exalt 
his pronouncements. I agree with them that his mouthings should have appeared 
on the editorial page. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, I get the impression that none of you folk have accepted the fact that 
John Kennedy is dead, but this ghost lingers on. No matter that the Reagan 
presidency accomplished a hundredfold more achievements than the short-lived 
Kennedy stint. No matter that the world is more at peace than in many decades. 
No matter that the economy is robust, interest rates are still affordable, jobs 
at an all-time high, inflation still wonderfully low. 
</P>
<P>
I sense that the problem Kaplan and those others have with Ronald Reagan is 
that he did accomplish something and that, of course, is unforgivable. Somehow, 
a vast majority of Americans seem to share that view, but precious few of them 
take the time to write letters to the "august" L.A. Times.

RESPONSE TO 'STING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You've no idea of the response which has resulted from Evelyn De Wolfe's 
article (Feb. 5) about the "sting" operation. To date, I've heard from 48 
individuals, from San Diego to San Francisco, and had two speaking invitations. 
</P>
<P>
The comments have been uniformly positive (although I'm sure her handling of 
the subject matter has dismayed some potential forgers). I am delighted to have 
been in a position to contribute to the article, and the exposure which you 
gave us is greatly appreciated.

GLASS TOWERS WILL 'TALK' TO EACH OTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A glass skin, now being installed on the $45-million La Jolla Centre II office 
building, will help the 10-story structure at 9255 Towne Centre Drive, San 
Diego, "talk" to its neighboring twin. 
</P>
<P>
While the deep-blue glass is primarily designed to reflect the sun and mirror 
the surrounding scenery, it will also be used to assist in a nightly laser 
light show that will give the appearance of two buildings communicating with 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
The developers are Oliver McMillan and Radnor Corp., both of San Diego.

APARTMENTS GET NEW NAME: METROPOLITAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Skyline Two, the $45-million apartment complex being built in the South Park 
area in downtown Los Angeles at 950 S. Flower St., has been renamed the 
Metropolitan, according to Dianne Severance, project manager for Forest City 
Properties Corp., the Los Angeles-based developer. 
</P>
<P>
Severance said the new name will give the apartment project, the first in South 
Park, a separate identity from the adjacent Skyline condominiums. They were 
completed in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Serrao, principal of Dworsky Associates of Los Angeles and the architect 
in charge of the Metropolitan apartments, said the complex "will be like a 
downtown resort -- an oasis complete with palm trees." 
</P>
<P>
The project, he said, is an opportunity to create a pleasant residential 
environment in what had been a neglected light industrial area.

HOME SALES IN CALIFORNIA ROSE ALONG WITH PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite higher prices, 1988 statewide sales of existing detached houses rose to 
a nine-year high, according to the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
During 1988, 562,759 houses were sold in California, an increase of 9.8% from 
1987. This was the best year since 1979, when 587,077 were sold. The median 
sale price in 1988 increased 18.4% from that of 1987 to $165,602. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the city of Los Angeles, January sales of 241 detached houses and 
condominiums was 14% lower than in December although 33% higher than January, 
1988, the Los Angeles Board of Realtors reported. 
</P>
<P>
The median price for a detached house in parts of Los Angeles served by the 
board climbed to a record $469,000 during January. This was an increase of 
$110,000 from January, 1988.

PLEASED WITH PLAN FOR GLOCKENSPIEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was delighted to read that there will finally be a glockenspiel in the heart 
of Beverly Hills. (Times, Jan. 9). 
</P>
<P>
It was my pleasure to see the one in Munich a few years ago and watch its 
impact on its surroundings, as well as people. There was an aura of festivity 
in its location in St. Mary's Square, City Hall and a lovely cathedral, with 
outdoor parking slots and tables and chairs where people lounged or ate and 
drank. 
</P>
<P>
And when the glockenspiel was in motion, everyone seemed to communicate with 
smiles and gestures and just plain watching. It was like a pause that 
refreshed, and I would hope that the one in Beverly Hills will serve a similar 
purpose.

THIEVES HIT GYM LOCKERS IN W. HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thieves have rifled about a dozen lockers at the Sports Connection gym in West 
Hollywood during the last few months, taking wallets, car keys and other 
valuables despite the presence of potential witnesses at the time of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
"These thefts are being carried out by a group of members who watch out for 
each other when they're operating. They're not deterred by the presence of 
people around them," according to a notice posted by management in the men's 
locker room at the sports club. 
</P>
<P>
The notice urged members not to bring valuables into the busy gym on Santa 
Monica Boulevard and to protect their belongings with sturdy padlocks. 
</P>
<P>
The club also stationed a security guard in the men's locker room and offered a 
reward of $500 and one year's free membership for information leading to an 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knew Victim 
</P>
<P>
"We do seem to have an unusual run of thefts down there," said Sheriff's Sgt. 
Finn Petersen. "They're clipping the locks off. It's almost impossible to see 
in a place like that how somebody could take the time to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, there have been at least a dozen cases, he said Thursday. In one 
case, the thief or thieves knew the victim well enough to recognize his car and 
burglarize it with the help of keys taken from his locker, Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
"That leads us to believe it's somebody who has a very good knowledge of the 
clientele," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Petersen suggested that the thief or thieves may hide heavy-duty clippers in a 
sports bag or locker and bring it out to snip the locks off when the dressing 
room is deserted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all speculation at this point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serious Concern 
</P>
<P>
Joel Aschendorf, general manager of the Sports Connection, said that locker 
thefts are endemic in health clubs but that the recent wave prompted management 
to take stronger precautions. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes in spurts but this is the first time we've actually addressed it as a 
serious enough concern to make real positive changes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While there have been no arrests, he said that employees had warned off a few 
suspects who have not been seen at the club since. The last theft was reported 
about two weeks ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Athletic Club, a neighboring gym on Santa Monica Boulevard, there is 
also an occasional break-in, receptionist Christopher Muldowney said. He said 
staff members walk through the locker room about every 15 minutes in an effort 
to discourage thefts.

HELPING LATINO STUDENTS SUCCEED; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA COLLEGE LAUNCHES COMMUNITYWIDE EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica College has launched a drive to increase the number of Latino 
students on campus and to offer additional support to help them succeed. 
</P>
<P>
The drive, which started this month, is being run by the college's Hispanic 
Students Center which has received nearly $37,000 in school funds this year to 
organize a variety of activities, including mentor programs, cultural events, 
field trips and essay contests. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to take a more active roll in trying to increase the success rates 
of Hispanic students in higher education," said Rocky Young, the college's 
assistant superintendent of education. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said that Latinos account for 11.7% of the college's 22,000 
students while the population of Los Angeles County is 35% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Role Models 
</P>
<P>
To attract more Latino students, school officials said they are doing a more 
effective job of selling the two-year college by meeting with students on a 
regular basis at local high schools. 
</P>
<P>
The college also plans to hold a series of workshops to give Latino students 
from Santa Monica, Fairfax, Los Angeles and Venice high schools a taste of 
college life. The young recruits will be taken on tours of the campus by Latino 
college students serving as role models. 
</P>
<P>
"The lack of role models has always been a big problem for many Hispanic 
students," said John Gonzalez, a college counselor who was recently named 
director of the Hispanic Student Center. "We will match the high school 
students with college students who will be able to give first-hand experience 
of the college. It will expose them to college life." 
</P>
<P>
The educational workshops and other programs are needed to combat the serious 
dropout problem in the Latino community, said Maria Martinez, a 22-year-old 
student and vice president of the college's Club Latin United for Education. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a real problem in the high schools -- students are dropping out like 
flies," she said. "The (role model) program would certainly help. I would like 
to encourage others to continue in school." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turning Point 
</P>
<P>
The new series of programs at Santa Monica College marks a turning point for 
the Hispanic Student Center, a five-year-old group run by the counseling office 
which has sponsored cultural events on campus. Gonzalez said the center will 
have its own office and staff when the college's new student center is 
completed later this year. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Gonzalez said he has been meeting with Latino student groups 
trying to enlist more support. One plan would encourage instructors and members 
of the staff to become mentors for some of the college students, helping to 
guide their careers. "The college should take a more active role in encouraging 
this type of relationship between its instructors and staff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another proposal calls for workshops for Latino college students on financial 
aid, career guidance, job interviews and four-year university transfers. The 
center is also planning to sponsor a week in May celebrating the ethnic 
diversity of all the students on campus, and a Cinco de Mayo essay contest with 
cash prizes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dual role of attracting students and then motivating them to explore 
all the options open to them," he said.

SPENCE + LILA by Bobbie Ann Mason; illustrated by LaNelle Mason (Harper &amp; 
Row: $6.95) 
</P>
<P>
Spence and Lila Culpepper have lived more than 40 years of married life on a 
farm in Kentucky, raising calves and ducklings, two daughters and a son. On a 
trip to Disneyland, Lila begins to have dizzy spells, which the doctors 
diagnose as tiny strokes. But they also find a knot in her left breast. 
</P>
<P>
"Spence + Lila" spans the two weeks during which Lila undergoes a mastectomy 
and subsequent surgery for a clogged artery in her neck. As Lila and Spence are 
separated for the first time since Spence's tour of duty in World War II, the 
couple face the prospect of what might be a final separation. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbie Ann Mason intersperses Spence and Lila's individual memories -- Lila 
reading Spence's letters aloud to her baby while Spence is overseas; Spence 
musing over the war -- amid the hospital regimen. 
</P>
<P>
Lila makes it through, however, and in the end prunes her garden.

EMPEROR OF THE AIR Stories by Ethan Canin (Harper &amp; Row: $7.95) 
</P>
<P>
This collection of short stories, Ethan Canin's first, laudably runs counter to 
the current trend of minimalist prose by writers in the younger-than-30 set. 
His symbols, laden with relevance, are woven into the text, at times 
overburdening the narrative. 
</P>
<P>
In the title story, a 69-year-old retired astronomy teacher refuses to cut down 
his 250-year-old elm tree, although it is infested with insects. When the 
narrator receives a note from his neighbor, Mr. Pike, that the city will do the 
cutting, he seeks revenge: He collects a bottle full of the offending pests, 
and crawls into his neighbor's yard to share the infestation. 
</P>
<P>
But, before he opens the jar, Mr. Pike and his son come into the yard. The 
father, assuming a tone of knowledge, is pointing out the constellations but 
inventing their names: the Mermaid's Tail, Mount Olympus, the Emperor of the 
Air. Somehow this scene stirs a change in the astronomer-narrator. 
</P>
<P>
Canin's "epiphanies are first-rate," Richard Eder wrote in these pages. "They 
are also everywhere. They do not transform the stories; they virtually are the 
stories."

Gumpert illustrates how technological advances distort values and ethics. Does 
the instant replay during a ballgame mark the end of sportsmanship or mar "the 
wisdom and accuracy" of referees or officials? Is truth represented when " 
'on-the-spot' coverage involves fragmenting an incident and restructuring the 
pieces into a television event"? 
</P>
<P>
"We as individuals are not in control of the technological environment in which 
we find ourselves," Gumpert concludes. But in "Talking Tombstones," he hopes to 
jar readers to question the media technology that surrounds us.

FED BOOSTS DISCOUNT RATE TO 7% TO BATTLE INFLATION

<P>
The Federal Reserve Board, signaling its determination to curb inflation even 
at the expense of economic growth, increased the interest rate it charges 
commercial banks from 6.5% to 7%. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the stock market opened Friday, the Fed announced that it had 
raised the discount rate to 7% from 6.5%, effective immediately, "in light of 
the inflationary pressures in the economy." 
</P>
<P>
"In taking the action, the board voted on requests submitted by the board of 
directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, New York, 
Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City 
and San Francisco," the announcement said. Dallas was the last regional bank to 
request the increase, which will take effect there Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 6 to 1 for the increase, with only Martha Seger voting against 
the increase. 
</P>
<P>
The news was a shock for the Bush Administration -- which is pinning its hopes 
for shrinking the budget deficit on robust economic growth -- and for financial 
markets, where stock prices and the dollar were falling. 
</P>
<P>
Prices were sharply lower Friday at the close of the New York Stock Exchange in 
moderate trading. The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 5.53 Thursday, 
plunged 43.92 to 2245.54. 
</P>
<P>
"People are reluctant to make a move over the short run," said Eugene Peroni 
Jr., an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia. "We probably 
won't see the market go higher for some time." 
</P>
<P>
The dollar, contrary to expectations, fell after the discount rate 
announcement. Higher interest rates usually mean dollar-denominated assets are 
more desirable, sending the value of the dollar higher. 
</P>
<P>
"The long-awaited discount rate hike gave the dollar no upside momentum 
whatsoever," said Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust &amp; Savings 
Bank in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"The market had discounted the rate hike, and some people were disappointed 
that the increase was not a full percent," Johnson said. "In addition, there is 
speculation that the West Germans might raise their own rates next week." 
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.8185 against the West 
German mark, down from 1.8220 late Thursday. Against the yen, the dollar ended 
the week at 126.10, down from 126.35. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Johnson, an analyst at First Albany Corp., said he expected the financial 
markets would respond moderately to the increase because it had been so widely 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's a Laggard' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a laggard," he said, following a series of gradual increases in 
short-term interest rates that began last spring. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, the Fed really just seems to be bringing it into a rational 
alignment with other short-term interest rates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The discount rate is the interest rate the Fed charges depository institutions 
when they borrow from their district Federal Reserve Banks. 
</P>
<P>
White House budget chief Richard G. Darman minimized the significance of the 
discount rate increase, saying it increases in other interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"The discount rate tends to follow, not lead," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Prod for Action' 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever one thinks of that, it should be an additional prod for action once 
we are in negotiations" with Congress on a plan to cut the massive U.S. budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Darman, unlike President Bush or Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, refused 
to criticize the Fed directly for pushing up rates, even though it severely 
damages prospects for Bush's plan to balance the budget without new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I'm able to resist at all times the temptation to get into commenting 
on the wisdom of what the Fed is doing," Darman said. 
</P>
<P>
The increase comes as Bush was making a high-profile trip to Asia to attend the 
funeral of Japanese Emperor Hirohito, along with the heads of state of dozens 
of other countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sign of Seriousness 
</P>
<P>
Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., said most other countries 
should welcome the news as an indication the United States is serious about 
controlling inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the world will applaud the Federal Reserve for standing against 
inflation and wonder whether it's been too little too late," Sinai said. 
</P>
<P>
Others may not be delighted. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not know if it would be that warmly received by other countries," Hugh 
Johnson said. "It implies the dollar should be strengthened and their 
currencies weakened." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raised in 1988 
</P>
<P>
The discount rate has been 6.5% since Aug. 9, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board then defied political considerations and raised its 
benchmark discount interest rate less than one week before the opening of the 
Republican National Convention in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The news sent the value of the dollar soaring and raised fears that the trade 
deficit would suffer because U.S. goods would lose the competitive edge in 
world markets that they gained with the falling dollar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Countdown' to Crash 
</P>
<P>
The Fed had kept the interest rate at 6% from Sept. 11, 1987, when the board, 
in agreement with Alan Greenspan, the new chairman, raised the discount rate 
from 5 1/2%. 
</P>
<P>
Critics at the time "accused him of starting the countdown to the stock market 
crash" of Oct. 19, 1987, said David Jones, senior economist at Aubrey G. 
Lanston Co., a New York securities firm. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the discount rate topped 6.5% was in March, 1986, when the Fed 
set a 7% rate, as interest rates continued a five-year tumble from the 
double-digit levels of the early '80s. The discount rate peaked at 14% in early 
1981.

HIGH COURT WON'T RUBBER-STAMP DEATH PENALTIES 
</P>

<P>
The California Supreme Court, which had one of the nation's highest reversal 
rates for death sentences when liberals were in the majority, now is well below 
the national average. 
</P>
<P>
That should not surprise anyone who remembers the 1986 elections, when Chief 
Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and two colleagues were voted out of office mainly 
over death penalty reversals. But what may surprise some members of the public 
is that the new, conservative-dominated court is still finding errors in a 
substantial number of death penalty cases. 
</P>
<P>
The court, under Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, has overturned 19 of 66 death 
sentences, or 28.8%, since appointees of Gov. George Deukmejian gained a 5-2 
majority in March, 1987. Sixteen of the 19 were unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
The Bird court, in about seven years of death penalty rulings, reversed 64 of 
68 death sentences, or 94.1%. 
</P>
<P>
The average for death sentence reversals by all state courts is about 41% since 
1976, when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld death penalty laws in a number of 
states, said the NAACP Legal Defense Fund Inc., which tracks capital cases. The 
reversal rate for 1988 was 40%. 
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that some Southern states have had 12-year reversal 
rates much higher than that of the current California court, even though nearly 
all of the post-1976 executions have been in the South. For example, 
Mississippi courts have overturned 51.58% of the death sentences, Florida 
45.87% and Alabama 47.31%. The lowest reversal rate listed was 9.43% in 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Factors at Work 
</P>
<P>
The figures suggest that death penalty reversals are affected by other factors 
besides the ideology of a state's highest court, such as the relative ease or 
difficulty of getting a death sentence at trial, the quality of trial judges 
and lawyers and the peculiarities of a state's law. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers say that many of Florida's reversals, for instance, involve 
cases in which a judge has imposed a death sentence over the jury's objections, 
an option that does not exist in California. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics do not include later reversals of state court rulings by federal 
courts. Lawyers say that 40% to 50% of state death sentences in the last decade 
have been set aside by federal courts, which have yet to review any substantial 
number of California cases. 
</P>
<P>
The California figures, on the other hand, support the view that a conservative 
court is much more likely to uphold a death sentence than is a liberal court. 
But the statistics, and examinations of individual cases, also indicate that 
the Lucas court has not entirely repudiated the Bird court's work. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the most frequent reason for reversals by the current court, cited 
in seven cases, has been a judge's instruction to jurors that the governor has 
the power to commute a life-without-parole sentence, the alternative to death. 
That instruction was ruled invalid by the Bird court in 1984 and the Lucas 
court has followed that ruling, while narrowing it somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
The justices have also followed a Bird court precedent in reversing three death 
sentences because the prosecutor told jurors that they could put their moral 
convictions aside, or allow "the law" to replace their personal judgment, in 
deciding on a sentence. In other cases, however, the current court has given 
prosecutors considerable leeway in jury arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Other Lucas court reversals have involved errors that, in hindsight, looked 
obvious. In two cases, trial judges failed to hold hearings on a defendant's 
mental competency, after a hearing had been previously ordered. One judge 
neglected to hold a sanity hearing, sent the jurors home, and then recalled 
them after a second jury had deadlocked on sanity. In another case, the defense 
lawyer's representation of another client in a civil case inhibited his 
questioning of a key prosecution witness. 
</P>
<P>
The gap between the two courts can be attributed partly to philosophy, but 
lawyers on both sides of the issue see other reasons. One is that many Bird 
court rulings involved trials soon after the passage of the current death 
penalty law, a broadly worded 1978 initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my suspicion that any state court system at the start will probably be 
reversing more than it's affirming, only because it's setting the parameters 
and defining the issues," said Deputy Atty. Gen. Dane Gillette, death penalty 
coordinator for the state Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Past the Early Bugs' 
</P>
<P>
"Now, trial courts are past the early bugs in the system and should know how to 
do it right, and you would expect to see a larger number of affirmances." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Laurence, director of the Death Penalty Project of the American Civil 
Liberties Union of Northern California, generally agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we are getting many affirmances now can be due to the Bird 
court's reversing a case several years in the past," forcing trial courts to 
change their procedures, Laurence said. 
</P>
<P>
One point of comparison between the old and new California courts is the six 
death sentences reversed by the Bird court and then granted reconsideration by 
new court appointees before the rulings became final. Five of the six sentences 
have been upheld by the Lucas court. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the difference between the two courts' rulings in capital cases can be 
traced to a single ruling, a 1987 decision by the Lucas court that intent to 
kill was not required for most death sentences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question of Intent 
</P>
<P>
Bird court decisions in 1983 and 1984, reading an intent-to-kill requirement 
into the death penalty law, were the court's most frequent reason for reversing 
death sentences. One justice who had joined those rulings, Stanley Mosk, 
shifted his stance and wrote the 1987 decision; the sole dissenter was Justice 
Allen E. Broussard, author of the earlier decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The other major difference between the two courts is more subjective and 
involves the concept of "harmless error," flaws in a trial that a reviewing 
court concludes were not serious enough to overturn the verdict. The Lucas 
court has applied that concept far more broadly than the Bird court. 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps the most striking example, the current court concluded that the jury 
may have been misled into disregarding the evidence against a death sentence 
offered by lawyers for Billy Ray Hamilton, convicted of a triple murder in 
Fresno. But over Broussard's dissent, the court ruled the error was harmless 
because none of the evidence would have persuaded a reasonable juror to vote 
for a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Gillette said the current justices, six of whom are former longtime trial 
judges, have "a more practical approach" than the former court, and are "less 
willing to assume that jurors are automatically influenced by every erroneous 
thing that occurs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Institutional Bias' 
</P>
<P>
In the Bird court, he said, "there may have been an institutional bias against 
the death penalty" and therefore a greater willingness to find errors to be 
grounds for reversal. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU's Lawrence said the justices look at a terrible murder and may not be 
able to conceive how a juror, regardless of errors in the trial, could have 
imposed any sentence other than death. "But that's the role of an appellate 
court," he added.

WHY DOES THE NOSE KNOW? NO ONE KNOWS

<P>
Scientists know a lot about smell. They know that it weakens as we get older, 
that it varies depending on a person's sex and ethnic background and that it 
involves more than just the nose. What they generally don't know is why. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the scientific community, smell has always taken a back seat to the 
other senses, probably because we don't live in an olfactory world. We live in 
a visual world, a world of sounds," said Dr. John S. Kauer, a New England 
Medical Center researcher trying to determine brain function using the nose. 
</P>
<P>
Last year he used video cameras and special dyes to trace the path of an odor 
impulse through the brain of a salamander. The work produced a "movie," or 
series of color-enhanced pictures, showing that the brain is "a parallel 
processor," handling many signals simultaneously, like a supercomputer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alzheimer's Link 
</P>
<P>
The research may have implications for the study and treatment of brain tumors 
by helping differentiate between tumors and normal tissue. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of researchers are poking their noses into such olfactory oddities as a 
link between premature decline in smell and Alzheimer's disease, a protein that 
ferries odor molecules through the nose, the fact that half of all people 
between ages 65 and 80 suffer major loss in the sense of smell and the trait 
peculiar to some nasal nerve cells to regenerate. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the only neurons in the human body that undergo this spontaneous 
renewal and spontaneous decay," Kauer said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the research in the field of smell is aimed not at medical advancement 
but at the bottom line. In Union Beach, N.J., Dr. Craig Warren heads a research 
and development team for International Fragrances and Flavors Inc., a company 
that produces scents for soaps, perfumes and other products made by hundreds of 
companies around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Smell, Warren said, "is the one sense for which the mechanism for perception is 
unknown." Scientists know how odor molecules are gathered by smell neurons, but 
they don't know how a few similar types of receptor cells can distinguish 
between thousands of different odors. 
</P>
<P>
Research suggests that the process of smelling involves more than the nose, 
Warren said. When blindfolded, "Most people cannot discriminate a lemon from a 
lime or an orange from a grapefruit." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Samplers 
</P>
<P>
International Fragrances and Flavors regularly brings in dozens of smell 
samplers, usually women, to rate and react to fragrances, with emphasis on how 
the fragrances can alter mood. In the process, Warren has found that 10% to 15% 
of the subjects display a particularly acute sense of smell. 
</P>
<P>
At the opposite end of the spectrum are those with no sense of smell. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Brooks, 35, of Philadelphia, took an uncommon route to this fairly common 
problem. Beginning in 1972 she began to experience what amounted to smell 
hallucinations; she thought she smelled an unpleasant odor when there was no 
odor present. Years of anguish and unsuccessful treatment finally led to brain 
surgery in which her olfactory nerve was removed, ending her hallucinations but 
leaving her incapable of smelling. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be very dangerous," she said. "I've already burnt things in the oven 
and I didn't know it, and there are smoke alarms everywhere. But on the other 
hand, it doesn't bother me not to smell because I still sense that I'm 
breathing and smelling the same as you are." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks' doctor was Richard Doty, director of the University of Pennsylvania 
Smell and Taste Center. Patients include the aged and professionals like wine 
tasters, firefighters, police officers, gas company workers, inspectors and 
cooks whose lives and livelihoods can depend on the sense of smell. 
</P>
<P>
"There have always been problems that people had and they've had no place to 
turn in the past," Doty said. "It's a frontier of science which really hasn't 
even been touched on." 
</P>
<P>
That's no accident, Kauer said. "Our world doesn't require it. We really don't 
go out and forage for food by sniffing along the ground. That evolution took 
place millions of years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Doty, Daniel A. Deems and Stanley Stellar published a report in August in the 
journal Neurology linking the loss of smell and Parkinson's disease. A year 
earlier, a similar study linked the loss of smell to Alzheimer's disease. A new 
area of research will try to determine if the nasal passage serves as a pathway 
for viruses or chemicals that contribute to those maladies, Doty said. 
</P>
<P>
The general subject headings scientists have explored give an idea of the scope 
of smell research: the influence of body tilt on the sense of smell and the 
effects of mouth movement, swallowing and spitting. 
</P>
<P>
Studies of ethnic groups have turned up some interesting distinctions: 
Korean-Americans appeared to have particularly acute ability to identify 
smells. Black Americans in one sampling had trouble with cedar and cheddar 
cheese. Whites had trouble with gingerbread. Native Japanese scored poorly on 
clove and fruit punch. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this mountain of research, a key question that puzzles scientists is 
precisely how the sense of smell works. 
</P>
<P>
At Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Solomon Snyder identified a carrier protein 
last summer that ferries odor molecules up the nose. The discovery occurred 
inadvertently in a search for receptors that play a key role in distinguishing 
smells, Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
"But another possibility as to why the receptors haven't been found is that 
they don't exist." 
</P>
<P>
Other factors -- sight, sound and environment, for example -- help provide the 
brain with cues in identifying smells, he said, but "the fundamental 
discrimination is going to be in the nose."

It could have been called "Canons of Canine Law." Had her whimsical side won 
out, it would have been called "In Pro Pup." 
</P>
<P>
But lawyer-author Mary Randolph of Berkeley, basically an earnest person, 
wanted the world to take her new book seriously, so she settled for utilitarian 
title of "Dog Law." 
</P>
<P>
Released by Nolo Press, a Berkeley desktop publishing house that specializes in 
legal self-help manuals, Randolph's $12.95 soft-cover opus may well be the 
definitive work on how to keep Rover on the right side of the law. 
</P>
<P>
Within its 258 pages, the book addresses practically every conceivable legal 
predicament a pup (or pup owner) can get entangled in. Pooper-scooper rules, 
leash laws, dog-bite statutes, airline regulations, nuisance abatement 
ordinances -- you name it. Randolph has boned up on it all and collected it for 
the benefit of dog-lovers and dog-haters alike. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Just for Owners 
</P>
<P>
"It's for dog owners, sure," she said. "But it's also for people who live down 
the street from dogs. There's a whole chapter there on resolving disputes with 
your neighbors. I think often people end up being in both positions." 
</P>
<P>
A 1983 graduate of the Boalt School of Law at the UC Berkeley, Randolph took an 
editing job at Nolo nearly four years ago after a brief stint practicing 
land-use law in Oregon. Also the author of "The Deeds Book: How to Transfer 
Real Estate in California" (deadly dull stuff by comparison, she admits), 
Randolph got drawn into doing "Dog Law" when an article on "Neighbor Law" she 
wrote for the Nolo News prompted a flood of reader questions. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I was skeptical," she said of a separate book on dogs. "Now I know 
there is more than enough to fill up a book." 
</P>
<P>
Digging for doggie facts was an 18-month process that took her first to the law 
library to "shepherdize" (that's legalese for a case research technique that 
has absolutely nothing to do with German dogs.) She also contacted experts such 
as city attorneys who write dog laws, lobbyists who work for the Humane 
Society, veterinarians and the like. 
</P>
<P>
Ever at her side through the whole project was her faithful technical 
consultant, Flash. A pound puppy of uncertain ancestry, Flash fetches shoes and 
newspapers on command, stops short at the curb even when she's chasing her 
beloved tennis ball, and has never, ever, been in trouble with the law. 
</P>
<P>
"The only cats she's ever chased, she's never caught," Randolph noted. 
</P>
<P>
Though the sheer volume of local and state laws threatened to overwhelm her, 
Randolph often found herself fascinated by the minutiae. No dog dare set foot 
in a motel bedroom in North Carolina, for instance -- a state statute expressly 
forbids it. Nor should any mere household hound presume eligibility for burial 
in the Coon Dog Cemetery in northwest Alabama. At least one such impostor was 
exhumed and expelled because he had never gone raccoon hunting in his life. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the book, however, dispenses advice and information on a much broader 
scale, in keeping with the Nolo Press philosophy. "We write books to address 
about 90% of people's problems," Randolph said. "But the other 10% we can't 
anticipate because the circumstances vary too much. What our books try to do, 
if we can't give you the answers, is give you enough to know what questions to 
ask." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Will Money 
</P>
<P>
Some principles culled from the book apply all over the country, such as those 
governing how you can provide for your pooch after you pass on. Basically, 
Randolph said, you can neither take it with you nor leave it to your dog, 
because property cannot inherit property. "You can leave your dog in a will," 
she said, "but you can't use your will to leave money to a dog." 
</P>
<P>
Your best bet, she said, is to will the pooch and some money to a trusted 
friend -- who will be compelled only by conscience to spend the money on the 
dog. 
</P>
<P>
You'd think all the attention would have Randolph raring to go on a sequel, but 
she's begging off on a follow-up on "Cat Law." 
</P>
<P>
"If there were any cat law out there, that would be one thing," she said. "But 
there aren't comparable laws that talk about cats, because cats don't bark and 
they don't usually bite."

SANDINISTA WOMEN MAKING GAINS AGAINST MACHO ATTITUDE IN NICARAGUA

<TEXT>
<P>
Nicaraguan women, many of whom fought on the battlefield to help bring about 
the Sandinista revolution, are back in combat demanding that the new society 
change its macho attitude toward females. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, a growing women's movement has obtained equal rights in 
divorce and had a satirical newspaper suspended for presenting women as sexual 
objects. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a battle won easily in Latin America, where women are expected to 
remain subservient to males, stay at home and rear children. This, despite the 
fact that many women must work outside the home to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Women's lives are further burdened by primitive conditions: shanty homes, lack 
of potable water or plumbing, wood-burning stoves. 
</P>
<P>
These day-to-day struggles, coupled with the lack of education and sexist 
attitudes, make the job of the women's movement more difficult. When asked 
about women's rights, a peasant woman in the rural south asked, "What is that?" 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to change the level of consciousness," said Lea Guido, head of 
the Luisa Amanda Espinoza Assn. of Nicaraguan Women. 
</P>
<P>
Guido's group is linked to the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front and 
takes its name from one of the martyrs in the fight to depose Anastasio Somoza, 
who was ousted in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"Participation by women in politics is a new phenomenon," she said. "It started 
because everyone was against the dictator, and that caused everyone to fight. 
It was the first victory for women." 
</P>
<P>
During the war, women served as guerrilla fighters or messengers and ran safe 
houses, organized demonstrations, set up contacts and sought the release of 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Dora Maria Tellez was a guerrilla commander. She is now the minister of health. 
Doris Maria Tijerino was a clandestine member of the Sandinista Front. She is 
now the nation's chief of police. 
</P>
<P>
Rosario Murillo, the nation's first lady, worked secretly with the guerrillas. 
Rosa Pasos, a lieutenant colonel in the army and spokeswoman for the Defense 
Ministry, acted as a go-between in clandestine contacts. 
</P>
<P>
Many women, especially in the capital, wear olive green uniforms for their 
administrative jobs with the army and Interior Ministry. The government even 
provides maternity uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of civilian women underwent arms training for militia work, some in 
the use of Soviet-made anti-aircraft guns. They are barred from combat but 
serve behind the lines as cooks and in administrative jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Women here traditionally were not just housewives. They always worked," Guido 
said. "But they used to be exploited by the men and not paid fairly." 
</P>
<P>
Most women work to add to the family income, and just finding scarce goods and 
budgeting with 20,000% inflation can be a full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
The official Sandinista newspaper Barricada said 70% of the pickers for coffee, 
the nation's main export crop, are women. Almost 49% of the state's 
administrative positions are held by women, but none is among the nine-member 
directorate that runs the Sandinista Front. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working on it," Guido said. "In a country so poor, so backward, it's not 
easy, but there's a political will." 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinista party has vowed to "abolish the discrimination that women have 
suffered with respect to men; it will establish economic, political and 
cultural equality between women and men." 
</P>
<P>
But old ideas are hard to change. 
</P>
<P>
"A woman's job is to take care of the family. What is this about rights? They 
have rights," said a man at a vegetable market. Several other men agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Having women in battle creates problems, jealousy, you know what I mean," a 
young male army lieutenant said. 
</P>
<P>
Guido's organization opened a legal affairs office in 1983 to deal with abuses, 
separations, and much-needed sex education. 
</P>
<P>
"The legal office has had to overcome women's traditional timidity and fear in 
publicly discussing problems that have long been considered exclusively private 
and better left unexamined," said Envio, a magazine published by the Central 
American Institute, a Sandinista think tank. 
</P>
<P>
Guido points out that education is an important part of the movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Many women in the rural regions are not married. They have too many children, 
it's part of the machismo," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the triumph, we didn't even have day care," Guido said. "It's still 
insufficient, but it's enormous in comparison."

LOSS OF MILLIONS SEEN AS ANIMALS ARE KILLED; 
</P>
<P>
AFRICAN POACHERS PERILING TOURIST TRADE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Big game is big business in parts of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists pay millions of dollars a year to come and see Africa's wildlife -- 
and smugglers pay millions more in strictly illegal purchases of ivory and 
rhino horn from poachers. 
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, the government charges $2,500 for each elephant legally shot by a 
hunter. 
</P>
<P>
That is just the start of the money the government makes from the scores of big 
game hunters who come here, the main jumping-off point for the rolling plains 
and desolate mountains of northern and western Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is one of the few places left where hunters can legally kill big game. 
</P>
<P>
"We have enough animals here," said Muhidin Ndolanga, general manager of the 
Tanzania Wildlife Corporation, the state-owned company that runs all the 
country's hunting safaris. 
</P>
<P>
"If people want to pay money to kill some, well then they might as well do it 
here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, as poachers step up the slaughter, governments across Africa are 
concerned that soon they may not have the animals that tourists want to see. 
</P>
<P>
Kenya banned big game hunting in 1977 and this year said poachers would be shot 
on sight. Three have been shot already, and even more have been killed in 
Zimbabwe, the only other country with a shoot-to-kill policy toward poachers. 
</P>
<P>
In Zambia, the government has been steadily cutting down the number of hunting 
safaris allowed to about half a dozen a year. A handful of countries, including 
Ethiopia and the Central African Republic, allow a small number of hunters. 
</P>
<P>
But about 200 hunters a year come to Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
Their bag runs to about 100 elephant a year, in addition to game ranging from 
lions to baboons. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, in just one August raid, Tanzanian police seized the tusks of 198 
elephants killed by poachers. 
</P>
<P>
Poachers kill several thousand elephants every year. 
</P>
<P>
Tanzania gets nothing of their earnings, but the government made $3.5 million 
from its hunting safaris in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Ndolanga said he expects income will rise this year. 
</P>
<P>
Only some of this comes from the government's killing fees -- $2,500 a head for 
elephant, $1,400 for lion and leopard and $365 for a zebra. Cheetah, rhinoceros 
and giraffe may not be killed. 
</P>
<P>
To shoot elephants or the big cats, hunters must sign up for at least a 21-day 
safari, at a cost of between $560 and $825 per person per day, depending on how 
large their party is and how many professionals are hired to help them find 
their animals. 
</P>
<P>
Every change of camp costs another $1,850, while transport to the hunting 
grounds ranges from $1,200 to $2,100 per vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Chartered aircraft, liquor and soft drinks are extra, as is the $1,000 fee for 
packing, documenting and shipping each trophy the hunter decides to keep. 
</P>
<P>
The hunters, who mostly come from the United States, are the big spenders of 
Tanzania's tourist industry. 
</P>
<P>
They accounted for more than a fifth of the $15.3 million Tanzania earned from 
its 118,000 foreign tourists during the year to the end of June -- a fraction 
of neighboring Kenya's projected 1988 earnings of $385 million from 700,000 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
But the poaching is threatening to wipe out this lucrative source of income. 
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's elephant population has been more than halved over the last decade 
to an estimated 77,000, largely because of poaching, Kenya-based 
conservationist Ian Douglas-Hamilton says. 
</P>
<P>
The population is dropping by 5.5% a year, which is quick enough to wipe out 
Tanzania's elephants by the end of the century.

WINTER WONDERLAND UNDER SIEGE;

<P>
MONARCH BUTTERFLY IN BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL

<P>
It could be a scene out of a fairy tale. 
</P>
<P>
Nestled deep in the 10,000-foot-high mountains here, millions of monarch 
butterflies drape the trees and carpet the forest floor. 
</P>
<P>
Their fragile black-and-orange wings, recuperating after a six-week, 3,000-mile 
trek from Canada and Northeast United States, are soothed by the morning light. 
The sun slips behind a cloud -- and the butterflies flutter into flight, 
creating the sound of a gently falling rain. 
</P>
<P>
But the monarch's winter wonderland is under siege. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buzz of Chain Saw 
</P>
<P>
Just a few hundred yards down the slope, the buzz of a chain saw cuts through 
the crisp mountain air. Flat-bed trucks laden with pine logs rumble 
continuously down the rugged roads. And near the sanctuary entrance, a mule 
train guided by a band of illegal wood smugglers slips into the forest. 
</P>
<P>
Widespread deforestation is the monarch's single biggest threat. Fueled by 
poverty, overpopulation and reckless logging companies, it is already harming 
the delicate ecological balance in the five small reserves here, the species' 
only known winter habitat. 
</P>
<P>
"If people continue cutting down trees at the same rate, the monarchs might 
last only another 10 years here," said Jorge Martinez, a field biologist for 
the Secretariat of Urban Development and Ecology. "The monarchs can't adjust 
(to a changing environment) that quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists still puzzle over how the 120 million featherweight migrants know to 
return thousands of miles to the same oyamel trees year after year -- 
especially since the butterflies here are five generations removed from those 
that left last year. 
</P>
<P>
But one thing is clear: The highland fir forests provide just the right mix of 
heat and humidity to let the monarchs hibernate without freezing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protected by Canopy 
</P>
<P>
Protected from extreme temperatures by the forest canopy, the inert insects 
spend most of their time hanging from the trees in enormous clusters of up to 
500,000 butterflies. During the warmest hours of the day, they float downhill 
in search of water and floral nectar, with which they store up body fats for 
the spring trip north. 
</P>
<P>
But indiscriminate logging -- sometimes even clandestine cutting within the 
preserve itself -- is making the habitat more vulnerable, according to several 
scientists and zoologists studying the monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
The gaps in forest cover, they say, expose the monarchs to slightly colder 
nights and warmer days. And with fewer trees to retain the sporadic rainfall, 
the damp forest is gradually becoming more arid. 
</P>
<P>
"The water level in the streams has gone down considerably," said Maria Elena 
Castro, director of the nonprofit Monarca Assn., which is devoted to protecting 
the butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
It is not just that pulp mills pay an average of $500 for a truckload of 
precious pine logs, or about $150 per tree. It is not just that the forests 
seem so plentiful that logging companies are reluctant to pay for proper 
reforesting. But for thousands of peasants who live near the preserves, 
including nearly 3,000 here in El Rosario, there is no other source of income 
-- or fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Their rocky, hillside plots do not yield enough corn and beans to feed their 
own families. The local mining industry has laid off workers. And the big 
commercial flower company in town has been on a rapid decline. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alternative Offered 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that there's a connection between poverty and deforestation," 
said Roberto Hernandez, who helps run the monarch preserves for SEDUE. "Our job 
is not to restrict the people's only source of income but to offer some kind of 
alternative." 
</P>
<P>
For the peasants of El Rosario, that alternative has been tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty local residents work in the preserve as game wardens and guides. 
Two-dozen food stalls are being constructed to accommodate hungry tourists. But 
the main income comes from the proceeds of the park. Last year, when the number 
of tourists doubled to 50,000, the community picked up $16,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The people now don't see the butterflies as their enemy," said Jaime Montes de 
Oca, subdirector of national parks for SEDUE, noting that 7,000 new seedlings 
were planted in the preserve earlier this year. "They understand that 
protecting the monarch's forest benefits them."

AS PARK SERVICE REGIONAL DIRECTOR, SHE BACKED 'LET IT BURN' DECISION IN 
YELLOWSTONE;

TOP WOMAN RANGER RODE OUT STORMS -- BUT FEELS HEAT OVER FIRE POLICY

<P>
Whether facing down dynamiters or fighting forest fires, the National Park 
Service's highest-ranking woman has spent most of her 30-year career fending 
off threats to America's most precious natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
As one of 10 regional directors, Lorraine Mintzmyer oversees 41 parks, 
including some of the "crown jewels" -- Glacier, Mt. Rushmore, Rocky Mountain, 
Grand Teton, Mesa Verde, and the mother of them all, Yellowstone, the world's 
first national park. 
</P>
<P>
In the three decades it has taken the 53-year-old civil servant to work her way 
up from secretary, she has survived many political storms. But the uproar over 
last summer's wildfires, which burned 706,278 acres within Yellowstone and cost 
millions of dollars, was one of the sorest tests in a pioneering career. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subject of Hearings 
</P>
<P>
"Let it burn" was the name critics gave the park's natural fire policy, the 
subject of congressional hearings in Washington, D.C., and around the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Park Service's wildfire management plan, in effect in Yellowstone since 
1972, gave officials discretion in suppressing lightning-caused fires, which 
usually were allowed to burn unless they threatened life or property. 
</P>
<P>
But last summer's extraordinary drought, combined with experts' miscalculations 
on just how dry Yellowstone really was, forced the Interior Department to 
declare total fire suppression park-wide on July 21. By then, however, it was 
too late. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, 25,000 firefighters struggled unsuccessfully to contain eight major 
blazes in and around Yellowstone. Only an early autumn snow brought the 
conflagration under control in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the crisis, Mintzmyer consulted almost daily with Park Service 
Director William Penn Mott and then-Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel, along 
with Yellowstone Supt. Bob Barbee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backed Controversial Decision 
</P>
<P>
It was she who backed Barbee's decision to limit the use of bulldozers to cut 
fire lines, a decision that angered senators and congressmen from the region as 
well as hundreds of Monday morning quarterbacks who thought the park service 
deliberately dragged its feet in firefighting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
She still believes her judgment call was right. 
</P>
<P>
"As responsible managers, we can't be defensive when our decisions are 
questioned or our policies are challenged," she said. "I think, over the long 
term, there will be a realization that the park and the people who were 
fighting the fires were doing the best they could under the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to deal with an event like a hurricane or an earthquake because 
it happens in one day and then it's done, you clean it up, you live with it. 
But it's quite another thing to go through months of it as we did. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a test the likes of which I'd never had before." 
</P>
<P>
She praised Barbee, who endured public ridicule and threats. "We know that 
every time we do something in Yellowstone it takes on proportions which just do 
not accrue to other areas," Mintzmyer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Go at It Again' 
</P>
<P>
"We all get tired, regardless of what profession we're in. The test is whether 
you get up the next morning and go at it again." 
</P>
<P>
Barbee has that kind of stamina, his boss said, but he is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the energy of two people," she boasted. 
</P>
<P>
At mid-life she is an avid outdoorswoman and inveterate hiker who tries to 
sneak in an outing or two in her parks when she visits them on business. Her 
region covers Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in her official olive-colored park service uniform, her only 
flamboyance is fire-engine-red fingernails and the gold ring she had fashioned 
from her distinguished service pin. The gold embossed circle is one of her most 
prized possessions. 
</P>
<P>
As only the second woman in park service history to be awarded that honor, 
Mintzmyer was acutely conscious that she was a trailblazer as she became the 
first female superintendent of a major park, then the first woman regional 
director. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that I've got to do a good job so that other ladies will have an 
opportunity. If I were to falter it might be difficult for some of my 
successors to overcome that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Left Banking Career 
</P>
<P>
Always an overachiever, she grew up in a small Iowa town where music dominated 
her life. She left a banking career and joined the park service in 1959 after a 
less-qualified man got the job she wanted. 
</P>
<P>
She started out as a clerk-stenographer, became program and budgeting officer, 
transferred as superintendent of Herbert Hoover National Historic Site in Iowa, 
and took the helm of Buffalo National River in Harrison, Ark., in 1977, shortly 
after that park service unit was established. 
</P>
<P>
There, local people were dead set against the park and the government's 
assertion of eminent domain to buy up private land. 
</P>
<P>
In a showdown over a stretch of river bank destined to be part of the park but 
still in private hands, Mintzmyer rammed through a condemnation order as a road 
contractor prepared to excavate. Then, hastily gathering a force of armed 
rangers from parks throughout the South, she faced down her adversary on a hill 
pockmarked with holes filled with dynamite. 
</P>
<P>
"We had this problem of how do you get the darned stuff out of the ground," 
Mintzmyer recalled. "We had a 24-hour patrol to make certain nobody got in 
there while the experts tried to figure it out. I was not very popular." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defused Tense Situation 
</P>
<P>
The charges eventually were exploded one at a time "so there wasn't a chain 
reaction, just a little 'poof.' " 
</P>
<P>
If she makes mistakes, Mintzmyer says, she hopes she errs on behalf of her 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a very rewarding feeling about being a public servant, and I see myself 
as a leader -- when something needs some action I'm not reluctant to get out 
front and do something about it."

PRODUCING THE NEWS ON HIGH SCHOOL TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
You can teach them how to focus a video camera or when to cue the anchorman. 
That's easy. But learning what to do when you're on the air and a monitor goes 
blank or the cue cards suddenly seem to be written in Greek -- that comes only 
with grueling experience, says high school television production teacher 
Richard Quinones. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, Quinones is trying to give his San Marino High School students a 
feel for the "down and dirty" part of television news. 
</P>
<P>
It's just six days into the semester, and, as an exercise, Quinones has his 
classes producing their first news broadcasts. Each class has just 50 minutes 
to mark its script with production notes, set up graphics on a display board, 
plan a series of camera shots and turn out a finished show on videotape -- 
like, say, a segment from Eyewitness News. 
</P>
<P>
The pace is hectic, but in Quinones' class, stress is a virtue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to put them up against the wall like that," says Quinones, a short, 
buoyant man who moves commandingly around the classroom like a basketball point 
guard. "They're not used to it. In the class, they can get a sense of what it 
feels like to be stressed out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feverish Ambiance

For the past eight years, the high school's television production program has 
been providing San Marino students with both broadcast skills and the feverish 
ambiance in which those skills are usually practiced. 
</P>
<P>
Quinones' more advanced students tape all the school's football games, produce 
public service shows, tape band concerts and fashion shows -- most of the time 
for broadcast by the local cable television station. 
</P>
<P>
"The program has had a dramatic impact," says Barbara Bice, director of school 
relations and development. "It has broadened the availability of broadcast 
equipment to the rest of the faculty." 
</P>
<P>
The experience of producing a kind of pictorial record of the school for 
broadcast to the public has not only transformed San Marino High School but 
some of the students as well, school administrators say. 
</P>
<P>
The class has a real-life quality to it that some academic classes lack, 
contends senior Karie Baker. "In a history class, say, you take a test and 
it's, 'Oh, boy, I got an A,' " says Baker, who plans eventually to be a film 
director. "But with this, it's actually seen by other people. I'm not the only 
one seeing it." 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, comparisons have been made between Quinones' pressurized classes 
and the CBS-TV show "TV 101," a weekly drama about a crusading high school 
video news program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of true to life," says Baker of the CBS show, with a shrug which 
indicates she's unimpressed. "We learn what television news is all about. But I 
don't think it (the CBS show) is as real as this class. We're not out there 
trying to learn who the drug dealers in school are, if there are any drug 
dealers. This is hands-on experience. We're not out to get anybody." 
</P>
<P>
The San Marino program started eight years ago, with hand-held puppets and a 
collection of cameras like the ones banks use as security monitors. Now 
Quinones' classroom holds more than $30,000 worth of broadcast-quality 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Quinones has used his program more as a public service vehicle then as 
a provider of news. But he wants to branch out eventually to regular news 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Quinones about the CBS show and he becomes pensive. " 'TV 101?' " he says. 
"It's a very interesting concept." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A News Show 
</P>
<P>
The idea of student reporters patrolling the school's hallways for news appeals 
to Quinones and some of his advanced students. Junior Jason Meagher talks about 
buttonholing teachers to elicit their opinions on the grade-withholding job 
action by teachers in Los Angeles or doing an investigative piece about the 
recent arrest of eight San Marino High School students in connection with the 
theft of a Chinese business sign. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is whether it's feasible to start a show like that," says 
Meagher. 
</P>
<P>
Quinones thinks so. He talks about starting a program to have video teams 
covering newsworthy events on and off campus. "We'll have field reporters 
feeding stuff live to the career center (in the school)," Quinones said. 
</P>
<P>
Since television production was introduced at San Marino High School, about 97% 
of whose graduates go on to college, some students have sort of stumbled in and 
discovered themselves, says Cathy Mencer, the school's coordinator for the Los 
Angeles County Regional Occupational Program. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a little bit of career exploration there," says Mencer, whose program 
pays teachers' salaries and provides the equipment. The regional program also 
runs other occupational programs in the school, like fashion merchandising and 
small business management 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
They Can Do Everything 
</P>
<P>
"Kids see they can do everything -- in front of the camera, behind the camera," 
adds Bice. 
</P>
<P>
About 750 students have taken at least a semester of Quinones' class in the 
past five years. More than 60 have gone on to major in broadcast production in 
college or to take jobs in the television industry. Quinones teaches four 
classes a semester, each with 18 students, and there's a waiting list to get 
in. "It's caught on like wildfire," says Bice. 
</P>
<P>
Quinones' graduates tend to be downright rapturous about the experience they 
acquired in high school. "Mr. Q.'s program taught me more than I've learned in 
college," said Keith Forman, a sophomore at Loyola Marymount University and the 
news director of the the school's FM radio station. 
</P>
<P>
"Loyola has a great communications program, but we (San Marino students) have 
learned so much already that we're above the preliminary classes. Beginning 
editing classes and all that stuff -- what they're doing is below what we were 
doing in high school." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Q shows you how to use the equipment, then he throws you right into it," 
adds Will Bortz, another San Marino graduate attending Loyola Marymount. "He 
has a great respect for the students. If you get to a spot where you're stuck, 
he'll help you. But basically it's in your hands. It teaches people 
responsibility. It gives you a lot of self-confidence." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Skills at All 
</P>
<P>
Quinones' current students generally concur. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Meagher says he arrived in the class last year with no skills at all -- 
"nothing besides knowing how to operate a VCR," he says. But by now, he has a 
virtual resume of credits behind him. He has produced a half-hour show on 
runaways, served as a member of the football broadcasting team and hosted talk 
shows for other student producers. Quinones -- who, besides teaching, is a 
partner in a small independent production company -- has even used Meagher as a 
paid production assistant on a cable television talk show and on a commercial. 
</P>
<P>
"The class has definitely inspired me to go further with it," says Meagher, who 
plans to attend a college television production program after he graduates from 
San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the students participating in today's exercise are green recruits, with 
less than two weeks in Quinones' class, and they're a little befuddled by all 
the equipment. The classroom bristles with track lights and robot-like cameras 
on wheels. A small room in the back is set up as a control room with a switcher 
(which can transfer the broadcast image to any one of the three cameras in the 
studio), an audio mixer, a videotape machine and a row of television monitors. 
</P>
<P>
The trick to running a class full of beginners is to have a handful of 
experienced technicians in each class -- students like Meagher and Baker, who 
have had at least a semester under Quinones' tutelage -- operating the 
equipment while the new students look on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Students Take Over 
</P>
<P>
After a day or two of that, the new students take over at the controls, says 
the teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow you do it," he says to one student. 
</P>
<P>
Quinones prowls the classroom studio, adjusting spotlights, moving the 
desk-like prop on the newscast set, peering critically over students' shoulders 
and offering quicksilver comments. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, look at that headroom there," he says, checking a shot of student 
anchorwoman Alyson Sedan on a monitor and noting that there is too much space 
above her head. "That's terrible. Tilt down." 
</P>
<P>
Misdirected cameras come under the category of aesthetic problems, says 
Quinones. "If the audience is conscious that something doesn't look right," he 
says, "it detaches them from the content of the show. You can't have those 
kinds of problems." 
</P>
<P>
During a side lecture on displaying graphics, one student has a blank look on 
her face. "You have this look on your face that tells me you're a little 
confused," says Quinones. 
</P>
<P>
The early part of the semester serves as a weeding-out process, Quinones says 
later. "I can be real hard on them sometimes, but they respect that," he says 
of his students. "They can see that obviously this guy is not here to pull 
their strings." Students who don't catch on are asked to leave, Quinones adds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Keeps Me Sharp' 
</P>
<P>
One by one, each news show moves on a rocky course toward a conclusion, and at 
last, as his fourth-period students file out, Quinones collapses into a chair. 
He's generally happy with the results of the day's project, he says. "The idea 
is to give the students as realistic an experience with television as 
possible," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Overseeing four news broadcasts before noon even provides a special 
professional benefit for himself, the teacher says. "It keeps me sharp," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
There's a kind of exhilaration among the students as they move on to their next 
classes. "It's really exciting," says Liz Stratford, a senior who has served as 
producer of one of the shows. "You have to stay on top of things and be 
confident in yourself." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of pressure," adds George Rees, another classroom producer, who 
had to contend with a sputtering piece of equipment. "All the attention was 
focused on the malfunctioning audio mixer, so I gave the command to dissolve." 
</P>
<P>
The student broadcasters have confronted a reality and, more or less, 
conquered. For Quinones, who wants to give his students a taste of the down and 
dirty, mission accomplished.

S. EL MONTE APPROVES BAN ON SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<P>
SOUTH EL MONTE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council moved to ban the possession and sale of semiautomatic assault 
rifles Thursday, joining at least 10 other California cities that have adopted 
such laws. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous vote drew widespread applause from most of the audience of more 
than 300, which packed the council chambers to urge adoption of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, modeled after one adopted Feb. 7 by Los Angeles, bans 
semiautomatic or carbine rifles, which use detachable ammunition clips of 20 
rounds or more. It specifically names 15 guns by make or manufacturer, and also 
bans their copies. 
</P>
<P>
At least 10 other California cities or counties have adopted bans after an 
incident in Stockton last month when a drifter opened fire with an AK-47 
assault rifle on a crowded schoolyard, killing five children and wounding 29 
others. About 17 other municipalities are considering bans, said Sheryl 
Patterson, staff attorney for the League of California Cities. 
</P>
<P>
The council also passed a resolution supporting a bill by state Sen. David A. 
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) that would provide a statewide ban on semiautomatic 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Steven L. Dorsey said the ordinance will be officially adopted on 
its second reading March 9. It would go into effect 30 days after that, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The South El Monte ban also affects sawed-off shotguns with folding stocks or 
ammunition magazines. Parts or kits that would convert a weapon into 
semiautomatic capability are also banned. 
</P>
<P>
The ban does not include handguns, semiautomatic weapons manufactured before 
1954 or weapons that are single-shot or bolt-action. 
</P>
<P>
According to the ordinance, "no person, including wholesale and retail gun 
dealers, shall sell, offer or display for sale, give, lend or transfer 
ownership of, or possess any assault weapon." 
</P>
<P>
Violating the ordinance is a misdemeanor under the City Code punishable by up 
to a $1,000 fine and a year in jail, Dorsey said. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who inherits an assault rifle will have six months to dispose of it by 
transfer to a lawful recipient or to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department or other police agency. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance will require Federal Ordinance Inc., a South El Monte gun 
wholesaler that is the nation's eighth-largest importer of military-style 
rifles, to dispose of its inventory. 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, the council heard impassioned pleas from gun advocates about 
citizens' rights to bear arms and arguments from those opposed to assault rifle 
sales, who expressed fear because of the ease in obtaining the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to take this lying down," said Russell Weiner, who spoke 
against the ban. "We're not going to give up; we're going to do something about 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Father Joe Greeley, a pastor at Epiphany Catholic Church who spoke in favor of 
the ban, said he was elated by the council's action and hoped it would prod 
higher legislative bodies to act. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased that the city saw fit to do something to ban these weapons," 
Greeley said. "I hope is sends a message to the county and to the state." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, South El Monte officials and members of East Valleys 
Organization asked Federal Ordinance to voluntarily halt the sale of such 
weapons. East Valleys Organization is coalition of the members of 12 San 
Gabriel Valley church congregations. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews before the meeting, several council members explained why they 
intended to support the ban. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Art Olmos, who proposed the ban, said the proliferation of assault 
rifles and lack of action by the state forced the city to act. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ignacio Garcia, who has two sons who are deputy sheriffs, said he 
supported the ban because of the increasing danger facing law enforcement 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Al Perez, in explaining his support for the ban, said assault rifles, 
unlike handguns or hunting rifles, have no legitimate use other than killing 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need that kind of assault weapon in our neighborhoods," said Perez, 
who owns a handgun. "It's overkill."

AZUSA TAKES UNUSUAL STEPS TO SHUT DOWN TWO TAVERNS 
</P>

AZUSA

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials, who say they are unable to control drug trafficking and other 
illegal activity at two bars, have taken the unusual step of asking a judge to 
close the taverns. 
</P>
<P>
In the interim, the city has persuaded a Pomona Superior Court judge to grant a 
temporary restraining order requiring the owners and tenants who operate La 
Villa Bar and JJ's Cocktail Lounge to take steps to prevent drug activity at 
the establishments. The landlords and tenants were also ordered to clean up 
inside the bars and the property outside. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the owners said that their clients had no knowledge about any 
illegal activity but that they will work with the city to remedy any problems. 
The operators of JJ's, Reynaldo and Victoria Virvia, could not be reached for 
comment. Manuel Vargas, who runs La Villa with Jose L. Gonzalez, declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scores of Complaints 
</P>
<P>
The bars, located in the 500-block of Azusa Avenue downtown, have prompted 
scores of complaints from residents, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Just about any and all types of criminal activity have taken place there," 
said police Lt. Jim Skogh . 
</P>
<P>
The city's complaint alleged that last year police arrested 65 patrons at JJ's, 
23 for either being under the influence of, having possession of or having 
possession for sale of cocaine and heroin. The other 42 arrests involved 
assaults, battery, possession of stolen property, public intoxication and 
serving alcohol to minors. 
</P>
<P>
At La Villa in 1988, police reported 20 arrests of patrons for being under the 
influence of, having possession of or having possession for sale of cocaine and 
heroin. During that time, police made 24 other arrests at the bar for incidents 
involving gunfire, battery, illegal possession of weapons, possession of stolen 
property, public intoxication and serving alcohol to minors. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Lloyd J. Wood said that neither the owners nor operators have been 
charged with a criminal offense in relation to any of the illegal activities in 
the bar. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking the closures, the city is using an innovative approach that relies 
on part of the state Health and Safety Code. Under the code, municipalities can 
"permanently abate" properties that present a public nuisance arising from 
continued drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
In its complaint, the city has requested that the taverns be closed for one 
year, that the court be given control of the disposition of the property during 
that time, that the bars' furnishings be auctioned and that the proceeds be 
used to reimburse the city for legal and other costs. The city has also 
requested a $25,000 fine be levied against each landlord. 
</P>
<P>
On March 8 the city will ask Pomona Superior Court Judge Thomas F. Nuss to 
prevent the taverns from selling alcohol until the case is tried, said City 
Atty. Peter M. Thorson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Main Objective' 
</P>
<P>
Thorson said the city ultimately wants no bars to be housed at either of the 
properties, even if the landlords follow through on promises of evicting the 
current tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main objective is to prevent alcohol being served there and to end the 
narcotics activities," Thorson said. "If (the lessees) are out, we have no 
objection to the premises being used for legitimate commercial or retail 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
According to the city's complaint, the property where JJ's is located is owned 
by physician James Joseph Femino, who has held title since 1982. A businessman, 
Mark Chapin Johnson, has owned the La Villa property since October, 1987, the 
complaint said. Neither could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Robert L. Bacon, who represents Femino, said the lease with the bar's 
operator expires on Tuesday and will not be renewed. David R. Nissen, who 
represents Johnson, said the tenants have been notified that they must 
immediately comply with the court's order or face eviction. 
</P>
<P>
Both attorneys criticized the city for not informing them of the problems 
before the complaint was filed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an incredible case of what I feel is outrageous conduct by the city of 
Azusa," said Bacon, a West Covina city councilman. "How can they punish the 
owners of the property when they've never given the owner . . . an opportunity 
to correct the situation?" 
</P>
<P>
Nissen said the lawful operation of the establishment is the tenant's 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expedient Method 
</P>
<P>
"Our client desires his property to be used in a lawful manner and not to be a 
problem for the city," he said. "He's taking all steps appropriate under the 
law to see that all activity the city has alleged to have taken place there is 
stopped immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"But . . . a simple phone call would have taken care of it without a lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
Thorson said the city believed it was more expedient to go to court because the 
majority of landlords would have been unresponsive to the city's requests. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally a phone call doesn't do it," he said. "If a phone call would have 
worked here, great. But 999 times out of 1,000 it wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
As to the assertion that the tenants, not landlords, were responsible for the 
conditions, Thorson said the law holds the property owner liable. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that the innocent landowner suffers," he said. "But they are 
the people who are ultimately in control of the property, and they're the ones 
the court says are responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Azusa officials said the civil approach has been used successfully in Los 
Angeles and San Diego and that they learned of the procedure through 
discussions with attorneys from those cities. 
</P>
<P>
"The cop on the beat can only do so much," Lt. Skogh said. "Basic crime 
fighting doesn't always work, so it's nice to have this civil remedy to fall 
back on." 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years it's been like putting your finger in a dam or stomping on a 
brush fire," Skogh said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit included affidavits from 25 police officers, four residents and six 
owners of neighboring businesses who complained of illegal activities and the 
effects of the bars on the community. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint also notes that in November, a group of Azusa residents presented 
the City Council with 170 signatures from residents complaining about the 
"deplorable" situation at the bars, citing broken bottles, trash and drunks. 
</P>
<P>
In the restraining order issued by Nuss on Feb. 16, the landlords and tenants 
were ordered to report to police any illegal activity at the establishments, 
something police say the operators have not done in the past. 
</P>
<P>
In one incident, Skogh said, the police were notified by emergency-room staff 
of a stabbing at one of the bars after the victim sought treatment. "By the 
time our officers got there, the blood had been cleaned up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other provisions of Nuss' temporary restraining order include installing 
outdoor lighting, hiring security guards, cleaning up the area around the bars, 
refusing to serve patrons who appear to be drunk and adhering to state 
Alcoholic Beverage Control Department regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The order also states that signs be posted at the front and rear of the bars 
indicating in English and Spanish that anyone in violation of the order could 
face civil or criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Skogh said the landlords have cooperated thus far with the city, but that not 
all the provisions of the judge's order have been met. 
</P>
<P>
As of late last week, the bars had yet to provide security guards or signs that 
followed the exact wording and specifications outlined by the court, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Wood said he anticipates that similar actions may become necessary as the 
city tries to combat narcotics problems at bars. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, who in January was named president of the Los Angeles County Police 
Chiefs Assn., predicted that other small cities would follow Azusa's lead, 
because the procedure "offers the only permanent solution to this kind of 
problem."

AN EX-MARINE RETURNS TO THE BATTLEFIELD AS A HUMANITARIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year Robert Seiple returned to Vietnam for the first time since his tour 
of duty as a U.S. Marine combat pilot ended in 1968. Seiple went back last 
April as president of World Vision, a Monrovia-based Christian relief 
organization, to arrange for the agency's return to Vietnam, 13 years after it 
had been expelled by the government. 
</P>
<P>
During that visit, Seiple said he saw a nation that was poverty-stricken and in 
disrepair, largely because of almost unabated strife. He found the communist 
government's bureaucracy cumbersome and unable to respond to the needs of its 
citizens. Vietnam was, he concluded, "worse off than it was 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
"Despair is beginning to set in," he said after the trip. "This is a country 
that essentially won the war and is losing the peace." 
</P>
<P>
But earlier this month, Seiple returned from his second visit to Vietnam since 
the war, this time with hope for the nation's future. Although conditions for 
the Vietnamese people remain dire, he said he saw ambitious reconstruction 
projects in the nation's cities and sensed a shift in the attitude of its 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"The change in the Vietnamese in the last 10 months has been dramatic," he 
said. "I think someone passed the word that this global isolationism has got to 
end." 
</P>
<P>
Seiple attributed the change in part to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
policy of glasnost with the West and loosening of state control, which has been 
reflected in varying degrees in communist governments worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese officials welcomed the involvement of groups such as World Vision, 
Seiple said, adding that he senses a growing tolerance of religion by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still five evangelical pastors in jail, so the the situation is far 
from utopian," he said. "(But) to an extent, the spirit of glasnost, a spirit 
of hope, is going through the world right now." 
</P>
<P>
Seiple's current mission exemplifies what many view as a more conciliatory 
relationship between the United States and Vietnam. During his visit last 
month, he made sure that 25 tons of resin to be used in the manufacture of 
artificial limbs for Vietnam's 60,000 amputees was delivered to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Combat Victims 
</P>
<P>
Many of the prospective recipients of the prosthetic devices lost limbs in 
combat against American and South Vietnamese troops. Others include children 
maimed by land mines left in the Vietnamese countryside. Vietnam requested the 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, such humanitarian efforts by American organizations in Vietnam 
were rare. After the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, most groups such as World 
Vision were expelled from the country. Tense relations between Washington and 
Hanoi precluded official U.S. aid and discouraged private assistance. 
</P>
<P>
That changed in August, 1987, when Gen. John W. Vessey led a U.S. delegation to 
Hanoi that negotiated an unprecedented agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government agreed to accelerate its effort to account for the 
more than 1,700 servicemen still missing 16 years after the U.S. troops left 
the country. Vietnam also agreed to facilitate the emigration of Amerasians, 
children fathered by U.S. servicemen, and citizens who had assisted the South 
Vietnamese government and have since been incarcerated in "re-education" camps. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the United States pledged to address Vietnam's "urgent humanitarian 
concerns," specifically assistance to those left maimed, widowed and orphaned 
by the war. 
</P>
<P>
Because the United States does not have normal diplomatic relations with 
Vietnam, direct government aid is prohibited by law. Instead, then-President 
Reagan encouraged several humanitarian organizations to establish assistance 
programs for the Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
World Vision, which had provided food and medical care to as many as 20,000 
Vietnamese children a year between 1960 and 1975, was one of five organizations 
that began developing programs after the Vessey initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"The marriage between (World Vision's) expertise and the Vessey initiative is 
quite good," said a U.S. official familiar with private humanitarian aid to 
Vietnam who asked not to be identified. "They are going back into Vietnam in a 
major way and we encourage them. Anything we can do to help them we'll do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regaining a Foothold 
</P>
<P>
Seiple said the initiative provided an opportunity for World Vision to regain a 
foothold in a nation that had been off-limits for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we have our foot in the door in a way that it will never be shut 
again," Seiple said. He noted that World Vision's purpose in reentering Vietnam 
was "to make the body whole. It's a nice metaphor for what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
If the door to Vietnam is now open for private relief agencies, Larry Ward may 
have been the first to knock at it. Ward, who oversaw World Vision's programs 
in Vietnam in the 1960s, before becoming president of Food For the Hungry, said 
he has made more than 40 trips to Vietnam since 1979, seeking greater access 
for humanitarian organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Ward accompanied the first Vessey delegation in 1987 and served as an 
unofficial liaison between the Vietnamese government and agencies that wanted 
to develop or renew relief programs in the country. Now retired and living in 
Phoenix, Ward said he is pleased with the progress made in Vietnam and praised 
the Hanoi government for its cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel personally that the Vietnamese have done a very fine job," Ward said. 
"(Government officials) always posture and they always want more, and yet I 
found when I got there, they were very grateful for what they received and put 
it to good use." 
</P>
<P>
World Vision provided $125,000 worth of aid to Vietnam last year and plans to 
spend $400,000 on programs in the nation in 1989, Seiple said. Almost all of 
the aid will be in the form of supplies and material -- not cash -- because of 
Vietnam's spiraling inflation and wildly fluctuating currency exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
During his visit last month, Seiple spoke with Vietnamese officials about 
building a World Vision hospital in Da Nang at a cost of $80,000. The 
organization also plans to provide internships for Vietnamese surgeons to train 
at American hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relocation Assistance 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its medical-relief efforts, World Vision also will seek to 
assist in the relocation of Amerasian children who wish to go to the United 
States. Amerasians, many of whom are now in their 20s, must wait for years for 
permission to leave Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
While in Ho Chi Minh City last month, Seiple spoke with a 21-year-old woman who 
had recently received approval to emigrate. For years, she told him, she had 
gone to the airport every day to see if her father had come to take her to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Living as virtual outcasts because of their American parentage, many of the 
estimated 30,000 Amerasians live on the streets and some have become involved 
with drugs and prostitution. Before traveling to America, they will spend six 
months in an orientation program in the Philippines, where groups such as World 
Vision hope to provide assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these kids are pretty tough," Seiple said. "They're street kids and 
they have gotten by with their wits, and if someone were to come up to them and 
express love and compassion, they'd probably be fairly suspicious. . . . 
They're the most pathetic victims of a war that produced nothing but victims." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Vietnam programs constitute a minuscule part of World Vision's 
$54-million worldwide relief effort, Seiple said the venture is significant as 
a means of repairing the damage done to both nations during the war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nostalgic Feeling 
</P>
<P>
As a former combatant, Seiple said his journeys to Vietnam have been especially 
meaningful. "When I go back I feel nostalgia, and I feel a great deal of 
sadness." 
</P>
<P>
He experienced one such nostalgic moment last month, when his flight touched 
down at the Da Nang civil airport, which had been a U.S. air base, out of which 
Seiple flew on more than 300 combat missions. 
</P>
<P>
He visited his old hangar and swapped war stories with the airport's director, 
Ho Vam Quy, who had flown Soviet MIG-17s in combat against the U.S. Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about how we both had sons who we hoped would never have to fight," 
Seiple said. "I've found (veterans) tend to have stronger peace-loving 
tendencies than those who have never had to fight." 
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, the American public has expressed increasing 
appreciation for Vietnam veterans, many of whom have complained of being 
slighted for having fought in a losing cause. Seiple said he hopes humanitarian 
aid to Vietnam will help close the schism that divided America during the war. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems obvious, even to a non-psychologist like myself, that there's a deep 
psychological wound from Vietnam that has not been healed in this country," he 
said. "If we take some of that pain and put it into a healthy resolve for 
reconciliation, I think some of that pain will disappear. 
</P>
<P>
"This country has been very generous when it's won wars. I think it will be 
generous again, even when it came in second." 
</P>
<P>
But Seiple said his concern for helping to repair the damage done to Vietnam 
during the war is in no way an effort to assuage his own conscience. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are driven by guilt," he said. "I'm not. I've not felt guilty one 
day for going over there. I went out of a sense of duty and obligation to my 
country. I've gone back out of a sense of duty and obligation to my God."

The City Council has agreed to extend a building code variance permitting the 
Anoakia School to use prefabricated trailers as temporary classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The one-year extension, approved 5-0 last week, will allow the private school 
to continue operating at 758 Anoakia Lane. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, fire officials had sealed off the temporary classrooms 
because the sprinkler systems were not hooked up to a water source. Frustrated 
by that action and what they said were other burdensome fire code warnings, 
operators of the school decided to close the school by June. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with city officials, school administrators later agreed to 
install a working sprinkler system and to keep the school open until at least 
1990.

COUNCILMAN SEEKS TO REPLACE ALHAMBRA DEVELOPER IN PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles city councilman has taken steps to replace a developer who had 
agreed to buy and renovate the landmark 1920s police station in Highland Park 
and build retail shops around it, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra developer Maurice R. Chasse has planned to restore the building and 
develop the 1.3 acres around it since 1986, but Los Angeles City Councilman 
Richard Alatorre said that negotiations have taken too long. He said he is 
recommending that the city find another private developer to purchase and 
restore the property. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, a three-year city search for a private partner to preserve the 
historic building appeared to have ended successfully when the Los Angeles City 
Council passed an ordinance approving the sale of the property to Chasse. But 
negotiations over the terms of the sale have dragged since. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Motion to Rescind 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre, who represents much of Highland Park, has introduced a motion to 
rescind the City Council's approval of the sale of the station at 6045 York 
Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, when the ordinance approving the sale to Chasse was passed by the 
council, Alatorre took a leading role in backing the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Enough time has elapsed, and we're all pretty frustrated," said Robin Kramer, 
Alatorre's chief of staff. "We've all dealt with it fairly and patiently, and 
we decided we have to go forward. The community is suffering, the building is 
deteriorating, and we've decided it's really time to move on." 
</P>
<P>
The motion introduced by Alatorre on Feb. 14 also instructs the city division 
of engineering to solicit new proposals to purchase and restore the station. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions between Chasse and the city came to a standstill last year after 
inspectors working for the developer discovered asbestos insulation in the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Provisions for Removal 
</P>
<P>
State law requires asbestos in any construction site be removed by a licensed 
contractor. Alatorre said that the city agreed to remove the asbestos and to 
charge less for the property, but Chasse and the city disagreed on how much it 
would cost to remove the hazardous material. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer said Chasse has voiced other concerns about the property in letters to 
Alatorre since December. And Kramer said Chasse has given no firm assurances 
that he can come up with financing to buy the property. Chasse originally had 
agreed to buy the building and the 1.3-acre property surrounding it for 
$725,000, but Kramer said city officials offered to lower the price by $80,000 
to compensate for removing the asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, last week, Chasse said he was still willing to buy the 
property at a reduced price, but that it would cost more than $110,000 to 
remove the asbestos. He said city officials have not replied to a letter he 
wrote them in November outlining his conditions for purchasing the property. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got financing; all I've got to do is reach in my back pocket," Chasse 
said. "Financing isn't the issue. The issue is the original agreement as 
written and agreed upon by the city. The city hasn't kept to that agreement. 
It's changed over the years." 
</P>
<P>
The station is a city, state and federally recognized landmark. It has stood 
vacant since 1983, when the Los Angeles Police Department's Northeast Division 
moved to larger quarters on San Fernando Road near Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Hopes 
</P>
<P>
Many civic leaders and local merchants hoped that Chasse's plan would preserve 
the building, revitalize the sleepy commercial district surrounding it and 
increase police presence in the area. Under the agreement with Chasse, a 
portion of the police station was to be used as a drop-in station for officers 
from the Northeast Division to write reports, make phone calls and meet people. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer said Alatorre remains committed to such a plan, and she said more than a 
dozen developers have expressed interest in the property in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a grande dame there; it's a beautiful building that is suffering," Kramer 
said. "There is a lot of interest in this site." 
</P>
<P>
The motion to solicit bids for the purchase of the police station specifies 
that new construction conform to the building's Renaissance Revival 
architectural style, that the station's basement be set aside for community 
use, and that an area near the sergeant's desk be made available as a Police 
Department substation, Kramer said.

PLAN B: ANOTHER VARIATION ON A FREEWAY THEME; 
</P>
<P>
29-YEAR CONTINUING BATTLE OVER ROUTE OF LONG BEACH EXTENSION BECOMES HEATED AS 
DECISION TIME NEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Woollacott , mayor of South Pasadena, leans against the railing of the 
York Boulevard Bridge, on the city's boundary with Los Angeles, and lets his 
eyes sweep across the scene. A segment of the Pasadena Freeway, buzzing with 
morning traffic, bends away to the east. Water trickles down a flood-control 
ditch. 
</P>
<P>
Extending north of the freeway, a narrow swath of greenery -- bushes and grass 
littered with a few rusty automobile parts -- stretches up the Arroyo Seco. 
</P>
<P>
"A piece of dirt," says Woollacott wryly, dismissing the undeveloped green 
strip. Here's where the South Pasadena would like to see the long-planned 
missing link of the Long Beach Freeway merge with the Pasadena Freeway. Put it 
here, Woollacott and his fellow council members fervently argue, not where the 
California Department of Transportation wants to build it, along Meridian 
Avenue, a block or so from the commercial center of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"What's more important?" muses the 71-year-old mayor, a slim, dapper man with a 
neat white mustache. "Putting a piece of useless land to productive use or 
putting 500 families out on the street just to save that piece of dirt?" 
</P>
<P>
The cluttered strip of urban back yard below the bridge, seemingly far from 
South Pasadena's quaint mansions and tightknit suburban neighborhoods, 
represents the last battleground in a war that has consumed the city for more 
than a quarter of a century. 
</P>
<P>
As Caltrans moves quickly toward completion of environmental studies for the 
proposed freeway extension, which will ultimately link the 10, 110 and 210 
freeways, Woollacott and the City Council are making a last-ditch stand on a 
proposal that would encroach on the Arroyo Seco. 
</P>
<P>
"Plan B," as they call the proposal, to distinguish it from a dozen or so other 
plans considered since 1960 by Caltrans, would not only take the freeway out of 
the middle of town but reduce the number of homes that would have to be 
demolished by about 500, Woollacott says. 
</P>
<P>
As drawn by freeway consultant Jess Reynolds in 1973, the Plan B route slants 
across the southwest corner of the city and follows South Pasadena's boundary 
with Los Angeles to the Arroyo Seco, the dry riverbed that runs south of the 
Rose Bowl. Then it would "co-mingle" with the Pasadena Freeway, either running 
side by side with the older freeway or joining it as a second deck. 
</P>
<P>
It would require using a half-mile-long corridor in the Arroyo Seco. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is a variation of the option known as the "Westerly Route," rejected 
by Caltrans as too costly and destructive. Plan B veers from the Westerly Route 
north Avenue 60 and rejoins the Westerly Route about 1 1/2 miles to the north 
at Orange Grove Avenue. As plotted by Caltrans, the Westerly Route would also 
swing away from the center of South Pasadena to the city line. It would have 
knocked out dozens of homes along Monterey Road and Pasadena Avenue, crossing 
the Pasadena Freeway near Orange Grove Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
But Plan B is beginning to look more and more like a long shot, some state 
officials and residents say. Just to get it on the Caltrans table may require 
action by both the state Legislature and the U. S. Congress, bypassing the 
green patch's designation as protected "parkland," to say nothing of overcoming 
a burgeoning resistance movement from the west side of town. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Long Beach Freeway continues to abruptly drop off the map 
at Valley Boulevard in Alhambra. With no link to the freeways to the north, 
complain residents of neighboring cities, north-south traffic has been 
hemorrhaging into local streets in Alhambra, Pasadena and South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The pressure is on Caltrans to close the gap. "It's probably the most 
outstanding example of a freeway gap in the Los Angeles region," says Jack 
Hallin, Caltrans' chief of project development for the region. "It's indicative 
of the problems of building in a built-up area. Everyone wants the freeway -- 
'but not in my back yard.' " 
</P>
<P>
As the 29-year-old debate moves toward its fateful conclusion, the strategy 
sessions and behind-the-scenes maneuvering are picking up markedly in 
intensity, all parties concede. In the past month, city officials have held a 
series of meetings with Caltrans officials, and they have huddled regularly 
with their Sacramento-based lobbyist and their special legal representative. 
</P>
<P>
"No big deal," cracks City Manager John Bernardi, who has been in the thick of 
it. "We just have to extend our days to 26 hours." 
</P>
<P>
Among the hurdles the city faces: 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans is an eyelash away from putting its money on the so-called "Meridian 
Variation," a route that would complete the freeway by plowing straight through 
the middle of town, roughly along Meridian Avenue. A final environmental impact 
study on the "Meridian Variation" was submitted more than three months ago to 
the Federal Highway Administration, which would provide most of the funds for 
it. Final approval could come as soon as May, Caltrans officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Plan B must overcome state law, which specifically prohibits the use of Arroyo 
Seco land for building a freeway, and federal law, which prohibits any federal 
project on previously designated parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Recent arrivals to South Pasadena's west side have provided new energy in 
building resistance to what some refer to as the "Eastern Establishment," the 
city's elected officials, and their determination to shunt the freeway 
westward. Organized as South Pasadenans Against the Westerly Route, they have 
begun forging alliances with residents groups in adjoining cities. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, city officials are optimistic that they can wrest major 
concessions from the state. 
</P>
<P>
"South Pasadena is not a freeway obstructionist," Woollacott said. "Everywhere 
we go, we get the response, 'Oh, you guys are the freeway fighters.' But we've 
been trying to get this thing built since way back in the late 1960s. It's just 
that we thought that there was a better way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Door-to-Door Campaign 
</P>
<P>
Feisty residents in the western part of the city, who would be most affected by 
Plan B, have no such qualms. South Pasadenans Against the Westerly Route 
(S.P.A.R.) has appointed block captains to carry the message door-to-door that 
the city has been "unfair" to their community. 
</P>
<P>
"We're saying to the mayor, 'We don't think you should save the city by 
sacrificing the west,' " said Mavis Minjares, a member of the group. "We're a 
part of the city, too." 
</P>
<P>
The choices are clear cut, city officials insist: Caltrans can split the city 
in half and demolish 1,267 homes in South Pasadena and neighboring El Sereno to 
build the Meridian Variation. Or it can skirt the center of town and demolish 
only 762 homes in the two communities under Plan B. 
</P>
<P>
The Meridian Variation would be 6.2 miles long and cost about $425 million to 
complete. The Westerly Route studied by Caltrans, somewhat similar in 
configuration to Plan B, would be 7.1 miles long, and cost $476 million. No one 
knows how much Plan B would cost. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials say they're open to city suggestions. "We're talking to 
them," says Jack Hallin, Caltrans' chief of project development for the area. 
"We're listening to what they have to say." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Two Problems' 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans is in the midst of a preliminary feasibility study of Plan B, to 
determine approximate costs and consequences to neighborhoods in its path. 
Pressed, however, Hallin expressed doubt. "There are two problems with that 
alignment," he said, "state law and federal law." 
</P>
<P>
The city has appealed to state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) to help overcome 
a 1975 state law prohibiting further encroachments of freeways into the Arroyo 
Seco. According to city officials, Torres, who represents South Pasadena, is 
preparing a bill to permit a freeway corridor of about half a mile, where the 
Long Beach and Pasadena freeways would merge. 
</P>
<P>
But a spokeswoman for Torres would not confirm that the senator was committed 
to such a course. "We're still looking at a variety of options and trying to 
gather all viewpoints," said Torres' aide Beth Bonbright. "It's a very 
difficult, emotional issue." 
</P>
<P>
She noted that Torres has until March 10 to "drop something into the hopper" 
during the current legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming state restrictions are eased, Hallin said, federal constraints may be 
even more resistant. The crucial federal law is a section of the Transportation 
Act of 1966, prohibiting the construction of federal projects on parkland 
unless "there is no feasible and prudent alternative to the use of such land." 
</P>
<P>
"Congress has not been disposed to waiving environmental law," Hallin said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has adopted a we'll-cross-that-bridge-when-we-come-to-it stance on the 
federal question. "Somewhere in the great United States there must be a freeway 
that runs through a park," says Woollacott. "Where there's one, there can be 
two." 
</P>
<P>
"All we can do is take care of the local (or state) level first," adds 
Bernardi. "Then we can move to the federal level." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Injunction 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Freeway's missing link has been debated, railed against and 
fought in South Pasadena ever since Caltrans first adopted the Meridian Route 
in 1964. In 1973, South Pasadena, which has always prided itself on its 
small-town atmosphere, joined with environmental groups to successfully sue for 
a federal injunction on the project. The plaintiffs argued that the state's 
environmental review procedures were inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
The injunction still stands. Even if the Federal Highway Administration (FHA) 
approves the project in May, state attorneys acknowledge, Caltrans must go to 
Los Angeles Federal Court to ask that the injunction be lifted. The city has 
already stated its intention to challenge that request, should Caltrans proceed 
with the Meridian Variation. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, a federal advisory committee on historic preservation dropped another 
major roadblock in front of the project, recommending to the FHA that the 
project be rejected because the original Meridian Route took out too many of 
the city's historic homes. Hence, Caltrans created the Meridian Variation, 
which swung around the city's historic district on Mission Street and avoided 
the distinctive homes on Monterey Road and on the small, tree-lined lanes north 
of Mission. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, voters were asked in a city-sponsored advisory referendum whether the 
city should continue to fight against a Meridian route for the freeway. The 
voters voted overwhelmingly in the affirmative. Ever since, the city has used 
the 71% "yes" vote on Proposition GG, as it was titled, as a rationale for 
continuing its efforts to shunt the freeway link to the west side of town. 
</P>
<P>
It's a sore point for S.P.A.R. members. "A lot of people who voted for GG 
weren't for a westerly route at all," said Minjares "They were for a 'no-build' 
option." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Expensive 
</P>
<P>
The west-side residents argue that a Meridian route would be less expensive and 
have less of an environmental impact than Plan B, because of the two plans' 
contrasting requirements. "The Westerly route would have to be elevated, while 
the Meridian route would be submerged," noted Minjares. "Noise and pollution 
will be much more difficult to control on the west side of town." 
</P>
<P>
Council members express dismay that they appear to be working to protect one 
part of the city while sacrificing another. "It's not an easy thing to think 
that you may be part of a decision to take anybody's house," said Woollacott. 
"That bothers me a lot. But I was elected to represent a city." 
</P>
<P>
City officials, depicting the Meridian Variation as the would-be "destruction 
of South Pasadena," have said that the city will fight to the end to prevent 
Caltrans from building along that route.

In December, the council voted to retain San Francisco attorney Antonio 
Cosby-Rossman to represent the city in a possible court challenge to the 
Caltrans plan. Council members also voted to use Community Redevelopment Agency 
funds to pay for the litigation, which they estimated could cost as much as 
$200,000.

Old-timers in South Pasadena are sticking to their guns in the face of 
adversity. But most have learned to be blase about the freeway issue even while 
they rush to shore up their positions.

"It's our main concern," says Bernardi. "It's always been our main concern. But 
it's been on our minds for so long, it's almost second nature now."

AZUSA COUNCIL CALLS FOR END TO RECALL BID 
</P>

AZUSA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has passed a resolution urging that a recall effort against 
Councilmen Harry L. Stemrich and Tony D. Naranjo be stopped. The resolution was 
approved on a 4-0 vote, with Mayor Eugene F. Moses abstaining. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, approved last week, has no direct effect on the recall drive. 
Recall proponents have until April 4 to gather the 2,806 signatures needed to 
force a recall election. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bruce Latta, who proposed the resolution, said the council needed to 
make a statement that recall elections are divisive and destroy the image of 
the city. Latta added that the $30,000 that would be spent on the election 
could be put to better use. Latta and Moses were targeted in a vitriolic recall 
in 1983, in which they retained their seats and two council members they 
opposed were ousted. 
</P>
<P>
"(Recall elections) distract the City Hall staff. . . . It causes a lot of 
dissension in the community because a recall is a negative campaign," Latta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Stemrich and Naranjo, who were elected as Moses allies last year, have accused 
the mayor of inciting and backing the recall, a charge Moses has denied. In 
explaining his abstention, Moses said the recall was initiated by voters, and 
they should have the final say. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the people's choice," Moses said. "They started it. I didn't want to 
irritate anybody by me taking a position."

CONFERENCE ON HOLOCAUST; 
</P>
<P>
EVENT ATTRACTS 'HISTORICAL REVISIONISTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Prof. Robert Faurisson had a question for his audience. 
</P>
<P>
How many, the French professor wanted to know, had any doubts that the Nazi 
Holocaust of 6 million Jews is, in fact, nothing more than a hoax? 
</P>
<P>
The audience was silent. 
</P>
<P>
Heads swiveled as people looked to see who was willing to acknowledge publicly 
the belief that maybe the Nazis had murdered all those Jews, many of them in 
gas chambers. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly a hand was raised, and another. 
</P>
<P>
The final count was five, out of an audience of about 200. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One-Sided Conference 
</P>
<P>
What was billed as a debate on the Holocaust last Tuesday in Torrance turned 
into a one-sided conference for people who call themselves "historical 
revisionists." The event was sponsored by the Committee for Open Debate on the 
Holocaust, a group with ties to the Institute for Historical Review, a group 
that formerly had offices in Torrance and asserts that the Holocaust is a 
fabrication. 
</P>
<P>
No spectators who believed unequivocally in the Holocaust showed up, nor did 
four speakers who were supposed to argue the case for the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
The militant Jewish Defense League, which had clashed with people attending an 
anti-Holocaust conference in Huntington Beach last weekend, stayed away as well 
under the belief that the debate had been canceled, according to Irv Rubin, its 
national chairman. "These people are scum," he said in an interview later. 
</P>
<P>
With the drama taken out of the event, the revisionists had only themselves to 
talk to. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approving Nods 
</P>
<P>
Among the statements that received approving nods: The numerous eyewitness 
accounts of gas chamber operations from concentration camp survivors have no 
value because the witnesses have not been cross-examined. At Auschwitz, what is 
identified as a gas chamber is in fact a mortuary that could not have been used 
as a gas chamber without killing guards and people in a nearby hospital. 
Instead of 6 million Jews dying, the true figure is no more than 300,000, who 
died from starvation, disease and Allied bombing. 
</P>
<P>
Also: Rather than being victims, Jews have made a flourishing industry of the 
Holocaust, and they control too much of the world's mass media. 
</P>
<P>
There were delighted smiles when one speaker declared that the name of Nobel 
laureate, Holocaust author and concentration camp survivor Elie Wiesel 
accurately stands for its translation into English -- "weasel." 
</P>
<P>
And laughter greeted the recounting of statements that the Nazis made soap and 
lubricating oil of the corpses of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officer on Duty 
</P>
<P>
Rick Louk, head of the Torrance police intelligence unit, was on duty at the 
hotel in case trouble developed. Professionally impassive at the event, he said 
afterwards that he could not help being affected by the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were there and listened to those people laugh about how they disposed 
of body parts that were still quivering. . . . It was gross," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing that people could joke about atrocities." 
</P>
<P>
Louk said he also noticed that speakers never talked "about the bad things the 
Nazis had done." 
</P>
<P>
After the morning session, he said, he was surprised to see almost the entire 
audience return after lunch. "Those people are so fanatical," he said. "I am 
just glad that it went off without any problems." 
</P>
<P>
A number of audience members declared their belief that the Holocaust story is 
part of a Jewish-Communist conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Faurisson, a professor at the University of Lyons, said at the meeting that he 
places "no value" on statements from former concentration camp inmates if they 
have not been subjected to cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
Faurisson conceded that his cross-examination requirement is unusual but said 
it is justified because the accusation that the Nazis used gas chambers is so 
serious that it should be treated with legal, rather than historical, methods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question About Gulag 
</P>
<P>
Asked if this standard would not also invalidate much of what is known about 
Stalinist labor camps -- which many consider to be on a par with Nazi 
atrocities -- Faurisson said he has not studied the Soviet Gulag and is not 
prepared to say whether the camps were as bad as they are claimed to have been. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the problem with drop-out speakers, conference organizers had trouble 
finding a meeting place. They changed the location twice, from the Tetelestia 
Christian Center to the Calvary Church of the Coastlands to the Quality Inn. 
</P>
<P>
The churches backed out after Louk called and explained that the Committee for 
Open Debate on the Holocaust is tied to the Institute for Historical Review, 
whose offices, formerly in Torrance, were fire-bombed in July, 1984, in what is 
still an unsolved case. Louk said he also told church officials that the Jewish 
Defense League had a record of confronting the institute. 
</P>
<P>
"You are liable to get caught in the middle for providing the facility," Louk 
said he told church officials. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jewish groups stayed away, they were not silent. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said it 
was a "sorry state of affairs" that the event attracted any news coverage. "I 
think those who call for a debate (on the Holocaust) deserve about the same 
attention as the Flat Earth Society," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can classify revisionists into two camps. (Some) people . . . deny the 
Holocaust because they are more comfortable not believing the reality of the 
Holocaust. The second group says the Holocaust never occurred and, given the 
chance, they would like to finish the job." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rubin: "These people are dedicated Jew-haters. The tragic, reprehensible 
thing about this movement is they are mocking not only the Jewish people but 
America, because America fought Hitler." 
</P>
<P>
On the factual issues raised by the revisionists, Prof. Raoul Hilberg, author 
of the three-volume "Destruction of the European Jews," said in an telephone 
interview from Burlington, Vt., that the evidence of a Holocaust was 
overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"We deal at the outset with a disappearance of a lot of people," he said. While 
scholarly debate continues over the numbers, the lowest "responsible" figure is 
his computation -- 5 million, he said. Three million died in concentration 
camps, 1.3 million were shot and 700,000 to 800,000 died in ghettos, where 
policies of starvation led to death rates of 1.5% a month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Captured German documents, including railway records and a Gestapo report, 
detail the number of Jews deported to specific camps and the number of 
shootings, he said.

SERVES AS CATHOLIC PRIEST; 
</P>
<P>
EX-NEWSMAN NOW SPREADS 'GOOD NEWS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYBIL BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven years ago, Father Charles J. Ramirez, associate pastor of Church of the 
Nativity in El Monte, was a television newscaster in Sacramento. But, he says, 
"I decided I'd rather be preaching the good news of Jesus rather than just the 
news." 
</P>
<P>
No sudden conversion caused his shift in careers, he changed because of a 
series of whispers that eventually swelled to a calling. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic church on North Tyler Avenue, where Ramirez is saying the 9 a.m. 
Sunday Mass, is large, beige, mutedly modern in design. 
</P>
<P>
As Ramirez delivers the homily, he strolls halfway down the aisle. He is 41, 
slightly chunky, moving easily in his vestments, with jet-black hair and dark 
warm eyes, bright as a bird's, that beam with warmth and contentment. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez describes his congregation as roughly 60% Latino, 30% Anglo and 10% 
Asian, predominantly Filipino and Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
Nativity is a charismatic renewal Catholic church, which is more evangelical 
than traditional Catholicism. The 400 or so attending the service shake hands 
before it starts and hold hands afterwards, reaching across the aisle so that 
the whole congregation is linked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Deacon in 1987 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez came to Nativity in June, 1987, as a deacon and was ordained Sept. 5 
that year, when he became an associate pastor. 
</P>
<P>
From 1974 to 1978 in Sacramento, first at the CBS affiliate and later at the 
ABC affiliate, he was a field reporter. The police beat, the City Council, the 
school board. A human interest series, "Around California." ("Like Charles 
Kuralt," he says, "but not as good.") 
</P>
<P>
And then newscasting began to be frustrating in unexpected ways. 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember covering a story in the poor section of Sacramento, working the 
swing shift," he said. "A woman was shot by her ex-son-in-law. You never leave 
the scene of a murder till you get a shot of the body being brought out on the 
gurney. 
</P>
<P>
"This woman was the mother of a big family, about eight kids." He tells how the 
children drove up one by one and reacted to the tragedy. "The members of the 
family didn't want us to shoot the body," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the TV crew got its pictures. The gurney was being wheeled away when one of 
the woman's daughters broke out from the gathering and ran after it, pleading, 
"Let me touch her one more time!" Ramirez recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like a vulture, waiting there. I thought, Something's not right here, 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changed Jobs 
</P>
<P>
He moved from the station to General Dynamics, a defense contractor, doing 
in-house TV shows, and he started teaching a class at a local parish. By 1982, 
the charismatic renewal movement was well established, and it became central in 
Ramirez's life. 
</P>
<P>
He had been brought up a Catholic in Azusa, the son of a salesman and a mother 
who later became a real estate agent, and attended what was then Pomona 
Catholic Boys High School and then Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, he said, "my concept of God wasn't a loving concept, more of a 
policeman in the sky." 
</P>
<P>
His grandmother always wanted a priest in the family, "but I always fought it," 
he said. "I wanted to get married and have a family and everything." 
</P>
<P>
In his room at home, there had been a picture of Jesus Christ ministering to a 
throng of the faithful. And Ramirez imitates how he felt as a youngster. "Can I 
ever find myself there? Nah -- that's for people who are straight-A students 
and have their lives together." In time, he said, "the picture starts coming 
into focus." At the end of seminary training, "the archbishop says, 'OK, you 
can step into that picture and become part of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The God of charismatic renewal is primarily a God of love, Ramirez says. "You 
know what it's like when someone loves you? There's a great sense of joy in 
that. Someone would walk to the ends of the Earth for you -- that's what it was 
like, my relation to Jesus. . . . So when I saw him more as lover than accuser, 
then it clicked." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Great Sense of Peace' 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying this "great sense of peace," he said, was a feeling that you want 
"to give it back. . . . . People always ask, 'What meaning does life have for 
me?' That's not the question. The question is, 'What meaning can I give to 
life?' " 
</P>
<P>
The key had clicked in the door, and now the door opened. In 1982, he entered 
St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, where he learned the Spanish in which he says 
some of the Masses. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez believes that his story is more ordinary than most people would think. 
"There are more vocations than there are priests," he said, explaining that the 
world has "so much static" that many with a calling for it never make it to the 
priesthood.

DRY RUN HELPS SOME BEAT FEAR OF FLYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last time Ada got up the nerve to fly was five years ago. It was a flight 
from Florida to California and she nervously paced the aisle the entire trip. 
She wasn't herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I had five Valiums and four glasses of wine," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It has been 15 years since Don last flew. That flight -- for reasons he still 
can't pinpoint -- left him afraid to fly, even though as a child he often 
accompanied his father, a private pilot, into the wild blue yonder. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had a horrible anxiety attack," the 45-year-old Huntington Beach 
resident said. "God, I couldn't breathe, I thought I was having a heart attack, 
I broke out in a cold sweat. It was like my heart had stopped and I was in 
suspended animation." 
</P>
<P>
Don and Ada are among 34 people who have met once a week at a South Bay hotel 
since January, hoping to overcome their fear of flying -- a phobia that some 
experts say afflicts as many as 25 million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
For six weeks now, they have gathered one evening a week to listen to Carol 
Stauffer, a clinical social worker, and former USAir pilot Frank Petee. They 
tell them why they should not be afraid. A large part of their message boils 
down to this: 
</P>
<P>
The odds of being fatally injured while flying are a whole lot less than while 
cruising a Southern California freeway. One estimate says that on a per-mile 
basis, a person is a hundred times more likely to die on a highway than in an 
airplane. 
</P>
<P>
"The most common fear is not being in control of the situation, that you are 
turning your life over to someone else," said Stauffer, who has taught the 
class since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"You almost never hear the good things about flying," she said in an interview. 
"It is not newsworthy." 
</P>
<P>
Stauffer and Petee conduct their classes for USAir. It is similar to others 
conducted around the country by different individuals or groups. Students, who 
pay a $250 fee, come from all walks of life. Despite their dread of flying, 
most of them do so out of necessity and they enrolled in the class to make the 
experience less traumatic. 
</P>
<P>
"Just sheer grit gets them on the airplane," Stauffer said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent session was a major event for the students, especially those who had 
not set foot aboard an aircraft for some time. The lesson plan: Sit aboard a 
jetliner at Los Angeles International Airport as it races down a runway. 
</P>
<P>
No, there is no takeoff. The class is not ready to leave the ground just yet. 
This is just a warm up. The jetliner reaches a speed of 138 m.p.h. before 
braking to a halt. Petee described the experience to the students as an "almost 
takeoff," designed to link what they have learned in class with the actual 
experience of being on a moving plane. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the hotel for the airport, the class was introduced to the 
aircraft's crew, including its three flight attendants. The attendants 
explained how they are trained to handle any emergency that might arise during 
a flight. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the obvious question is, 'Have any of you been involved in an 
evacuation?," one student asked. 
</P>
<P>
No, the attendants replied, although one said she had been aboard an aircraft 
when its cabin lost air pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens in that?" asked another student. 
</P>
<P>
"You die," joked another student. 
</P>
<P>
Once the students were assured that depressurization -- when oxygen masks drop 
from the plane's ceiling -- is nothing to fear, the other crew members were 
introduced. Next, the classroom lights were dimmed and Stauffer led the 
students through some relaxation exercises. They were told to wrinkle their 
foreheads by raising their eyebrows. Stauffer slowly counted to five, then told 
them to relax. 
</P>
<P>
The students then headed for the airport, where they gathered at about 9:30 
p.m. at Terminal 1, Gate 14. 
</P>
<P>
Some appeared confident, others nervous as they looked out a window at the 727 
that they would board. 
</P>
<P>
As she waited, a woman with fear of flying named Kim said she had not flown for 
about a year and half. She said her fear was gradual and may have begun years 
ago when an airliner crashed near her home in the Chicago area. "I had worked 
myself up to the point where I would almost cry before I had to fly," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Once they were aboard the jetliner and strapped to their seats, the students 
repeated the relaxation exercises. Then the plane began to taxi as Petee gave a 
nonstop commentary over the plane's public address system, telling students 
exactly what was happening inside the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, air traffic controllers gave permission for the make-believe 
takeoff to begin, and Petee passed the word along. He kept talking as the 
aircraft headed down the runway. 
</P>
<P>
"The airplane is already accelerating quite fast. We are already up to 80 
knots, 100 knots . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"Let's get it on," Don blurted out, grinning nervously. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . 115 knots, 120 knots," Petee continued. 
</P>
<P>
Then the student passengers felt as if they were being pulled forward, the way 
air passengers normally feel during a landing. 
</P>
<P>
"We are reversing," Petee explained. "The brakes are on, the power is back and 
the spoilers are up." 
</P>
<P>
The students, now familiar with such terms, applauded, and Petee asked if they 
wanted to try it again. They did. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that was so much easier than the first one," Don said after the second 
trip down the runway. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the gate, people who once might have rushed off a plane lingered on 
board, congratulating themselves. 
</P>
<P>
A student named Elizabeth said she was not frightened by the experience. "I 
knew we weren't going anywhere," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another student, a middle-aged woman who did not want to divulge even her first 
name, voiced a similar sentiment: "I have a great sense of reality. I wasn't in 
the air." But 36-year-old Celia, who stopped flying more than a dozen years 
ago, proclaimed a personal victory. "I am so proud of myself, I am elated," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Celia said she is still apprehensive about the one-hour graduation flight that 
she and the other students were to take soon. Nevertheless, she said, she will 
definitely be there. 
</P>
<P>
As for Ada, she had "no problem" with racing down the runway. And she, too, 
said she will attend the graduation flight. Being afraid to fly, she said, puts 
a crimp in your travel plans. Pretty soon, she said, you run out of places you 
can drive to. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen all of California."

A couple will not seek custody of a 10-year-old girl they believe is their 
daughter, but they still want tests done to determine if they are her parents, 
their lawyer said. Ernest and Regina Twigg of Langhorne, Pa., would settle for 
a chance to visit with the girl, said John Blakely, the Twiggs' attorney. "We 
feel that we should not be denied the right to know that girl as a child," Mrs. 
Twigg told the Tampa Tribune in an interview. The Twiggs filed a lawsuit last 
year seeking genetic testing of the girl, Kimberly Mays. The girl's father, 
Robert Mays, of Sarasota, Fla., is fighting to block the tests. The Twiggs 
claim they brought the wrong child home from Hardee Memorial Hospital in 
Wauchula, Fla., in 1978, and that Robert and the late Barbara Mays took their 
child the same day. The girl the Twiggs reared died of a congenital heart 
defect last August.

An Italian court convicted seven people, including five organized crime 
figures, in a 1984 train bombing that killed 16 Christmas travelers and wounded 
more than 200. A panel of judges in Florence acquitted two people after ruling 
there was insufficient evidence to tie them to the Dec. 23 bombing of an 
express train traveling between Florence and Bologna. Five of the defendants 
were sentenced to life in prison, including Giuseppe (Pippo) Calo, an alleged 
Sicilian Mafia crime figure. The other two received 25- and 28-year terms. The 
prosecution alleged that the defendants wanted to use the bombing to distract 
authorities investigating organized crime.

Four San Jose men have been arrested as part of "Operation Polar Cap," a 
continuing federal probe into a $1-billion cocaine money-laundering network. 
Johnny Elias Chawi, 34; Emil Youssel Chawi, 45; Sadir Mouaflack Ajmeh, 32, and 
Leon Elovits, 38, were taken into custody after allegedly making cash deposits 
of less than $10,000 to banks to evade banking laws that require notifying the 
Internal Revenue Service if more than $10,000 is deposited, the U.S. Attorney's 
Office in San Francisco said. So far, as a result of the investigation, 37 
people have been charged with taking in at least $1 billion through merchants 
in Los Angeles, Texas, Florida and New York. The money eventually was sent to 
Colombian drug lords, authorities said.

PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS MOVED TO SHELTERS

New York City has implemented a new policy to transfer psychiatric patients 
from city hospitals directly to homeless shelters to relieve overcrowding in 
psychiatric wards, officials said. "We are going to try it on a small scale," 
said First Deputy Mayor Stanley Brezenoff. "If it doesn't work, we won't 
continue it." Dr. Luis Marcos, vice president for mental hygiene at the city's 
Health and Hospitals Corp., said work has started to provide 46 beds at two 
shelters in Manhattan and Brooklyn with mental health services. Critics of the 
new plan, however, said all it does is shift patients from one city agency to 
another without solving any problems. Experts have traced the city's current 
homeless problem to a longstanding decision by the state to release tens of 
thousands of psychiatric patients without any medical supervision.

Some Serbian activists asked Yugoslav authorities for weapons to protect 
themselves amid growing protests by the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo 
province. Meanwhile, national officials announced that more troops were being 
sent to the troubled area of Kosovo, an autonomous province in the republic of 
Serbia. Tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians have walked off their jobs since 
Monday, protesting a constitutional change and demanding the resignation of the 
provincial Communist Party chief. In response, a group of Serbs urged the 
government to "give us arms to defend ourselves with because the situation is 
critical."

A 10-year political romance led to the altar Friday for Gov. John McKernan and 
Rep. Olympia Snowe, Republicans whose courtship began in the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Radio stations and newspapers throughout the state carried congratulatory 
messages for the couple, who had dated for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seemed like the right time to do it," said McKernan, 40. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those types of situations where you either fish or cut bait," said 
Snowe, who turned 42 last week.

SERVICES SECTOR GOES HIGH TECH TO STAY AHEAD OF GLOBAL RIVALS

Ask your insurance man a tough question about your policy these days and you're 
likely to get a long answer in short order. If Bill Pfordt has his way, you'll 
get a complete computer printout, too. 
</P>
<P>
F. William Pfordt, director of computer systems at Philadelphia's Provident 
Mutual, is planning the company's third-generation computer system, to be 
installed in a year or so. He envisions the day when every field agent will be 
able to work out all the financial and actuarial details of a policy within 
minutes by tapping into the company's electronic data bank with a portable 
laptop computer. 
</P>
<P>
"We all realize now we're in a fight competitively for our lives," said David 
Mahan, Provident's director of policy services, whose 800-member staff is 
closely wedded to Pfordt's computer bank so that it can generate continuously 
updated information about every policy and every client on the company's books. 
</P>
<P>
What is happening in the insurance business is happening in newly competitive 
service industries across the board. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the decade, it was the U.S. manufacturing sector that first 
felt the lash of global competition. But now the economy's huge service sector, 
responsible for more than 70% of the country's economic output and about 
three-fourths of all jobs, is well along toward a radical restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of this are everywhere. Automated teller machines on every other downtown 
street corner make 24-hour bank services commonplace in most cities. Travel 
agents equipped to calculate the cheapest and most direct air fares And 
routings with the flick of a computer key also make and confirm hotel 
reservations worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Becoming More Useful 
</P>
<P>
Arnold &amp; Porter, Washington's largest law firm, is busily redefining and 
expanding what a lawyer can do for a client, offering real estate and financial 
management, market research and public relations counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Laser scanners have speeded supermarket checkout lines for 10 years, but 
industry leaders are now using them to track selling patterns, control 
inventory and provide store managers with a complete database from which to 
plan orders. 
</P>
<P>
For manufacturing industries, the payoff of modernization is already clear. 
Manufacturers, particularly of durable equipment, have rebounded so thoroughly 
from the productivity slump of the inflation-ridden 1970s that increases in 
output per hour since 1981 have outstripped the legendary productivity record 
of the 1950s and 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1981 and 1987, according to the Labor Department, manufacturing 
productivity soared 4.8% a year, compared to a growth rate of 2.8% from 1948 to 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
Yet by official measures, productivity in the services sector lags. In the 
aggregate, the Labor Department says, services productivity advanced only 1.2% 
a year between 1981 and 1987, substantially short of the 2.6% annual growth 
rate from 1948 to 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Stranger still, the productivity record is poorest for some of the service 
industries -- such as financial services, insurance and retail food marketing 
-- where new techniques and technologies have led to improvements that are 
obvious to any client or customer. 
</P>
<P>
By some measures, productivity of insurance companies and supermarkets has 
actually declined over the past 15 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult to Measure 
</P>
<P>
But tell that to managers at Provident Mutual or Washington's Giant Food, and 
they will stare at you in bewilderment. They know that they are operating more 
productively, and they have balance sheets to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
One cause of the apparent contradiction lies with the way productivity is 
measured in the services sector. For manufacturers, it is easy to count the 
number of widgets produced per man-hour. And it is even possible to take into 
account the quality of the widgets. 
</P>
<P>
"To improve productivity in manufacturing, it's obvious enough that you 
substitute a machine for a person," says David L. Birch, a one-time 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who runs a consulting firm in 
Cambridge, Mass. "But what do you do to improve service productivity?" 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, you do not do what the insurance industry and supermarket business 
have done. By one measure -- value added per person employed -- productivity 
among insurance agents declined by 0.4% a year from 1979 to 1987. And 
productivity declined about 0.1% a year for retail food stores. 
</P>
<P>
"The insurance industry seems ideally suited to the data-handling capabilities 
of modern computers," Brookings Institution economist Martin Neil Baily has 
written. It is "implausible," he argues, that the insurance industry should 
show up as unproductive as the statistics suggest. 
</P>
<P>
As for the grocery business, Baily observes that the advent of the supermarket 
after World War II boosted productivity substantially. But "we could only 
invent the supermarket once," he says, and the supermarket so raised 
productivity that future growth was difficult to achieve even though the range 
and quality of products and the ease of shopping for them have continued to 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problems With Standards 
</P>
<P>
In fact, most successful supermarket operations, such as Giant, have 
deliberately added personnel to their retail stores -- and therefore, by 
definition, made them less productive -- in the interest of providing better 
quality service to customers. That has more than offset streamlining in the 
inventory and management ends of the business. 
</P>
<P>
But if measurements of insurance industry and supermarket productivity do not 
square with what seems to be going on, the fault may lie with the measurements. 
As Baily of the Brookings Institution concedes, there are serious problems with 
the standards used to measure exactly what it is that many service industries 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
Should the output of a school teacher be measured by the number of students in 
the class? Should the output of a government worker be measured by the number 
of memos that move from the in-box to the out-box? 
</P>
<P>
Harder yet are measurements of quality. When is one supermarket twice as good 
as another? What makes one insurance policy twice as good as another? 
</P>
<P>
The dollar value that society attaches to services might provide one means of 
measuring them. But University of Maryland economist Mancur Olson argues that 
the value of many services simply cannot be "brought under the measuring rod of 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Money, by Olson's reasoning, is not an adequate measure when an insurance 
company improves the quality of service to its customers. Nor does the price of 
food reflect the added attractions of a food store that offers customers an 
opportunity to buy a wider variety of goods more quickly in a more pleasant 
setting. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of how productivity is measured, service companies make management 
decisions to improve the product, increase market share, speed up profits -- 
whatever meets the competitive needs facing the industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Efficiencies Aren't Visible 
</P>
<P>
Giant's management team, operating from unpretentious company headquarters in 
Landover, Md., have other objectives than improving their formally measured 
productivity as they seek to dominate the grocery business in the Washington 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, we are today more labor-intensive in all our stores than we have 
been in years," says Alvin Dobbin, senior vice president for operations. Most 
Giant stores have been adding behind-the-counter butchers, fresh seafood, salad 
bars and ready-to-cook specialty foods. 
</P>
<P>
The efficiencies are behind the scenes: in the automated warehouses, the 
in-house production of dairy and bakery products, a radio-controlled trucking 
fleet and the computer-linked central inventory control system. Yet the 
government statistics that measure productivity show that the supermarket 
industry has one of the worst records in the services sector. 
</P>
<P>
Department stores, by contrast, show improving productivity. 
</P>
<P>
"But have you tried to buy anything in a department store lately?" Dobbin asks. 
"There's nobody to help you find what you want, and when you find it there's 
nobody to buy it from." 
</P>
<P>
At Provident Mutual, an old-line, middle-sized life insurance company that 
recently abandoned a wooded campus in a posh Main Line suburb for a sleek glass 
tower in Philadelphia's regenerate downtown, the company's main object these 
days is to improve services to old customers and devise ever more flexible 
insurance products to attract new customers. 
</P>
<P>
That is the point of the computers, the newly experimental telephone service 
call with the electronic simulated voice that reads out the status-to-date of 
each client's account, the laser printouts, the laptop computer each sales 
agent is urged to carry. 
</P>
<P>
"Even 10 years ago," says Pfordt, "we couldn't do any of this." 
</P>
<P>
In the insurance industry as with supermarkets, official productivity is 
lagging. But with Provident, as with Giant, the services being offered are 
succeeding in the one place that counts -- the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to measure the service sector by productivity," consultant 
Birch says, "and the future of America is supposed to hinge on that, then you'd 
better eliminate the best hospitals, the best schools, the best newspapers -- 
because none of these is productive if you apply an industrial standard."

FOR JACK KENT COOKE II, LIFE TURNED OUT TO BE UNLIVABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE BECKLUND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Jack Kent Cooke II was a child growing up in Los Angeles in the 1960s, his 
grandfather owned a sports empire bigger than a boy could dream, bigger, in 
fact, than any in American history. 
</P>
<P>
The senior Jack Kent Cooke owned the Los Angeles Lakers, the Los Angeles Kings 
and the Washington Redskins. He built the Fabulous Forum on a civic dare and 
brought superstars like Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to play there. 
</P>
<P>
But the grandfather traded away his Los Angeles holdings for skyscrapers, 
racehorses and other things. And the young man who was his namesake would never 
grow up to inherit an empire valued today at more than $1 billion. Instead, he 
would haunt the Forum that might have been his, wrangling tickets to hockey 
games, borrowing money to party and invoking his famous name with strangers he 
sought to befriend. 
</P>
<P>
In January, a few days before the Super Bowl his grandfather's team had twice 
won, young Cooke died in his modest Glendale apartment. The coroner concluded 
on Feb. 16 that he had died of alcoholic liver disease and a related heart 
condition. He was 26. 
</P>
<P>
No one who knew him thought of him as an alcoholic. Friends described him as a 
witty, decent young guy who partied too hard. Family members said he had a 
history of serious kidney problems since childhood and bouts of hepatitis that 
left him in delicate health. 
</P>
<P>
But the autopsy showed that somewhere along the way, the party man became an 
alcoholic. And, many friends say, Jack Kent Cooke II died more victim than 
beneficiary of his famous name. 
</P>
<P>
No one is certain just how it happened, but there are clues. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Jack had trouble just learning to write his name. In second 
grade, he was diagnosed as having a serious learning disability. His mother was 
so concerned about the lack of help for youngsters like him that she founded 
the National Center for Learning Disabilities, which is today the major such 
resource center in the country. 
</P>
<P>
There was something else about his name, something he had learned since 
childhood: being a Kent Cooke meant you had to make your first million early in 
life, and make it on your own. Jack couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
"You could say," observed Jack's sister, Jeannie Kent Cooke, a producer at the 
ESPN sports network, "that my brother's life is a story about someone from a 
very well known family who felt a lot of pressure to be more successful than 
the other males in the family." 
</P>
<P>
"It's very, very sad, a damn waste," said his father, Ralph Kent Cooke, a 
former Brentwood film and advertising executive. "Who's to blame? I don't know, 
if there is anyone. . . . It's a tough thing to live under the family name." 
</P>
<P>
There are dozens of pictures of Jack Kent Cooke in the archives of the Los 
Angeles Times, several photos of his son, Ralph Kent Cooke, and only one 
picture of his grandson, Jack Kent Cooke II. 
</P>
<P>
That picture was taken in 1972, when 10-year-old Jackie was seated with his two 
brothers and sister in a circle around his glamorous young mother, Carolyn Kent 
Cooke. The photograph accompanied a story about his mother's charitable works 
with a headline that summed her up as "Personal Conscience With Clout." 
</P>
<P>
Her clout stemmed mostly from her father-in-law, Jack Kent Cooke. Kent Cooke 
had blown down to Los Angeles from Canada, a stubborn, imaginative, self-made 
man with lots of friends and lots of enemies. 
</P>
<P>
He had pulled himself up by his bootstraps by selling encyclopedias (legend has 
it to people who couldn't read) and by playing sax and clarinet in nightclubs. 
He made his first million by buying up listless Canadian radio stations and 
revamping them. 
</P>
<P>
When he moved to the United States to play for bigger stakes in the late 1950s, 
and found laws prohibiting foreigners from owning broadcasting stations, he was 
made a citizen by an act of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
In rapid fire, he acquired a one-quarter interest in the Redskins, and bought 
the Kings and the Lakers outright. He built the Forum in Inglewood in 1967 
after a dispute with officials who ran the Sports Arena in Los Angeles. He also 
owned some newspapers, and now owns the Daily News in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie was 5 years old when the Fabulous Forum opened. While most boys were 
dreaming of players' autographs, Jackie watched the athletes work out, talked 
to them sometimes in the locker room. He saw Elgin Baylor hang motionless in 
the air years before Michael Jordan's first name became "Air." When the Lakers 
won the NBA title, loudspeakers introduced a man with his own name. 
</P>
<P>
But, like his Canadian grandfather, Jackie loved hockey best. Someday, he 
dreamed, he would capture the Stanley Cup that was the only prize he knew had 
eluded his grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
When Jackie was 11, his parents were divorced, and his mother moved to New York 
and married Pete Rozelle, current commissioner of the National Football League. 
Jackie moved with them and, by all accounts, developed a close relationship 
with his stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
That divorce was only a foreshock. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Jack Kent Cooke's bride of 42 years divorced the family patriarch in a 
settlement that would make the Guinness Book of World Records. Within weeks, 
Jack Kent Cooke had sold his Los Angeles sports empire to Jerry Buss and moved 
east. 
</P>
<P>
The younger of his two children, John, would side with him, and is now 
executive vice president of the Washington Redskins. The eldest, Ralph 
(Jackie's father), would side with his wife, and refuse to speak to the senior 
Cooke for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The two reconciled only last year. Ralph, long a race car enthusiast, now runs 
his father's Elmendorf Racing &amp; Breeding Farm in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between grandson and grandfather is not precisly clear. Jack 
himself often said he had "blown it" with his grandfather, and had been 
"disowned" by him. However, friends said he also received regular stipends from 
his grandfather and talked to him occasionally by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Kent Cooke said in a brief telephone conversation that he felt "pretty 
badly" about his grandson, and preferred not to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
At young Cooke's funeral in Westchester, N.Y., he was remembered as the impetus 
for the founding of the National Center for Learning Disabilities in New York 
in 1977. Jack's mother, now known as Carrie Rozelle, acted as its president 
until last year. 
</P>
<P>
Dyslexia was, and in some ways still is, a little-understood condition. Until 
1963, the neurologically based group of disabilities often called dyslexia did 
not even have a name. 
</P>
<P>
Many people with learning disabilities, including Nelson Rockefeller, Cher, 
Thomas A. Edison and Pablo Picasso, were famous. But studies also show that 
many suffer from feelings of inferiority. Some develop compensatory behaviors 
ranging from lying to joking. 
</P>
<P>
The Rozelles declined to be interviewed for this story, but referred a reporter 
to New York psychologist Dr. Betty Osman, who began seeing Jack when he was a 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
"He really wanted to succeed, both for his family and for himself," Osman said. 
"And, in a sense he did, because he was such a lovely person. But he wanted so 
much to be great." 
</P>
<P>
After his death, those who knew him best would ask themselves whether Jack's 
failure to succeed -- failure even to seem happy -- was rooted in his learning 
disabilities, his splintered family history or some other shortcoming that was 
Jack's alone. 
</P>
<P>
The happiest time of Jack's life, his sister said, was when he attended a 
private boarding school for learning-disabled teen-agers, where he excelled in 
sports. Later, he went to Biscayne College in Florida. He was arrested at least 
once for drunk driving, and left after a year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, he moved to Los Angeles and attended Pepperdine University. According 
to the registrar's office, he dropped out in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Galles, assistant professor of economics, described Jack as an affable 
young man with a "salesman's personality" and uneven health. 
</P>
<P>
Once, Galles said, Jack "held out the prospect of a bribe" to avoid flunking 
his public finance class. When that did not work, he said, the young man 
explained his dyslexia. Galles said he then gave him an exam orally, and he 
failed because he had not studied. 
</P>
<P>
Before dropping out, Galles said, Jack told him he was making $60,000 to 
$80,000 a year working for a stockbroker, passing on tips he picked up at 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
A friend who asked not to be named said Cooke had worked as a "stock analyst" 
for a time. He did not know where or in what capacity. But others dismiss such 
statements as the attempts of an insecure young man to impress others. 
</P>
<P>
"He liked to play the big shot," said his father, Ralph. "He wouldn't know a 
good stock tip if he heard one. . . . (After being) put down all those years 
(as dyslexic) he felt he had to say something in public to his peers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 'Major Factor' 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear just how serious Jack's learning disabilities were. Osman said 
his disabilities clearly were a "major factor" standing in the way of his 
graduation from college and a successful career. 
</P>
<P>
According to the few friends here who knew about his disability, Jack could not 
balance his own checkbook and found it painful to write a message on a greeting 
card. But he kept stats at games and pored over box scores in the paper. 
</P>
<P>
"He was really good at hiding it from everybody," said Ollon E. Downing, an air 
traffic controller who was one of his best friends. "Once when he had trouble 
taking down a telephone number, he tried to make a joke out of it. . . . He 
didn't like to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
After dropping out of college, young Cooke lived in a luxurious condominium in 
Santa Monica, and told friends it was rented for him by his maternal 
grandmother. Friends say he received monthly allowances from his mother and 
Rozelle, and his grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
He set out to make his own million through a number of money-making schemes 
friends said ranged from the inspired to the hare-brained. He tried a career in 
music, his grandfather's first vocation, spending $15,000 on a video. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to show his family he could accomplish something in his own way," 
said Lynn Russo of Brentwood, one of his closest friends. "But everybody always 
thought he could do better." 
</P>
<P>
One reason for his lack of business success, Russo said, was that he devoted so 
much time to his friends. With his own family divided by divorce, geography and 
career goals, she said, Jack became peacemaker and matchmaker for his friends. 
It was Jack, she said, who brought her and her husband together. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with Jack was that he never quite found a purpose in life," his 
father said. "He was like a lot of kids these days -- they want to own 
businesses and be president of the company before they know anything. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We were born with that Canadian ethic. We have to make our own way. . . . We 
don't just go handing out money, any more than it was handed out to me." 
</P>
<P>
He told his son to acquire sales experience, and Jack went to work at a music 
store, and at a car lot. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first met him, I thought, how can a guy with all his connections be 
working in a used car lot until 9 at night?" said Will Worthington, 28, another 
acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he would go out after that, drinking and partying, playing it fast and 
easy. Why someone who had so much in store for him down the line wasn't more 
responsible for himself, I could never understand." 
</P>
<P>
Another friend, John Duken, a music store executive, said young Cooke used his 
father's card to play golf at his country club, but never felt welcome at his 
father's house. "Twice he drove me by his house in Bel-Air," Duken said. "But 
we didn't go in." 
</P>
<P>
His father, however, said he felt "very close" to his son, and spoke with him 
weekly. Rozelle and his mother offered "constant emotional and financial 
support," his sister said. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologist Osman said the Rozelles "felt badly" that there was "a certain 
lack of emotional support" of Jack from his grandfather. That emotional 
distance, combined with his parent's divorce and the feeling of inferiority 
that stemmed from his disability, undoubtedly all contributed to his seemingly 
desperate search for acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
"Learning disabilities themselves don't do that," said Osman, who delivered 
Jack's eulogy. "Family rejection alone may not do it. But a combination . . . 
of factors does." 
</P>
<P>
Jack remained Jack Kent Cooke's most loyal sports fan. Friends said he would 
watch every Redskins game he could on television and bet on his grandfather's 
horses at Santa Anita. Above all, he loved the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
The Forum his grandfather had built would become the heart of his social life, 
as well. He called Claire Rothman, president of what is now Jerry Buss' Forum, 
for tickets and passes to concerts. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt there was a certain amount of opportunity he was cheated out of because 
his grandpa no longer owned the Forum," said Rothman, who knew him as a child. 
"He was a very sad young man. He had enough connections to knock on doors, but 
after a while, when he couldn't deliver, the knock sounded hollow." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow in the last few years, the part of Jack Kent Cooke II that was nice guy 
got lost in the part of him that got desperate. Regulars at the Forum Club 
began to think of him as the guy who laughed a little too loud. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so hungry for friends, for love, that it dictated his life style," 
Worthington said. "(I thought) he was a classic case of a child born into a 
rich family that spends all its time on business and doesn't give enough time 
to the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Kings players who had turned up at his parties "began to stay away -- he had a 
reputation for being too wild," a staff member said. Last year, when he wanted 
an initialed Kings hockey stick for his birthday, he had to ask. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, he had real friends, and -- although such a thing is difficult for an 
outsider to measure -- a wellspring of love he could, and did, turn to in need. 
</P>
<P>
"The family loved him in their own special way," Russo said. "Not the kind of 
love most people would have. (It was) a little bit sad. They were all very much 
for him. But I think they ran out of patience." 
</P>
<P>
She said his allowance was cut "way back" to about $25,000 a year. And, to keep 
up with a life style that included front row seats to concerts and leased 
Lincoln Continentals, he moved away from the West Side. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime last fall, friends said, he moved into a small, unremarkable apartment 
in Glendale called the Chateau Louise, where he began to pull himself together. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he had had problems with (alcoholism)," said his new girlfriend of 
four months, who asked not to be named. "But he was over that. . . . He'd only 
drink Coke." 
</P>
<P>
He and his friend Ollon Downing, the air controller, had come up with a 
proposal to build and operate a sports bar and hotel in Telluride, Colo. "He 
was planning on coming out and visiting me to present his idea," said his 
father, speaking from Kentucky. He or Jack's grandfather would have staked them 
to the idea if it proved reasonable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the sports bar was only an interim goal, Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . All of the business plans were to make enough money to do one thing: to 
buy the Kings and win the Stanley cup," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before ending the interview, Jack Kent Cooke was asked this question: did he 
know his grandson's lifelong dream was to buy the Los Angeles Kings? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," he said. "But do you know how many boys dream of buying the Los Angeles 
Kings? There must be 50,000. And more who want to buy the Lakers? And even more 
who dream of buying the Dodgers?"

GUARDS ATTACKED AT JUVENILE HALL; 8 CRIPS ESCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight gang members escaped from a maximum-security juvenile detention facility 
in Downey after they overpowered two guards, tied them with bed sheets and 
locked them in a closet early Saturday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The inmates, members of a Crips street gang from the Watts area, beat two 
guards at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall and used the guards' keys to flee the 
facility, said Sgt. Mark Dryer of the Downey Police Deparment. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Aitken, 23, a guard at the county-run facility, was attacked by at 
least six youths when he was escorting an inmate back to a dormitory cell after 
a trip to the bathroom at 3:45 a.m., said Shirley Gray, superintendent of the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
One of the youths grabbed Aitken in a "bear hug" while five others hit him with 
their fists, Dryer said. Fellow guard Troy Cole, 31, heard the disturbance and 
went to help Aitken but was knocked unconscious, he said. All guards at the 
facility are unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
"One was just overpowered by sheer numbers, and the other was hit over the head 
by an object believed to be a chair," Dryer said. 
</P>
<P>
The youths then locked the guards in a utility closet, removed tables and 
chairs from the dormitory and stacked them up to scale a 20-foot concrete wall 
that surrounds the facility, Gray said. Two other youths who witnessed the 
attack apparently used the opportunity to escape as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Were Gone' 
</P>
<P>
Other guards saw the youths scaling the wall but could not prevent them from 
escaping. "By the time they got there, they were gone," Gray said, adding that 
the youths left a trail of footprints leading away from the facility. "(The 
guards) also heard dogs barking in the neighborhood," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the facility contacted sheriff's deputies and police from Downey, 
South Gate and other cities to search for the youths. At 6 p.m. Saturday, one 
of the eight, a 17-year-old youth, returned to the facility accompanied by 
several family members. He gave authorities no information about the other 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
By Saturday afternoon, four of the youths had already contacted relatives and 
parole officers by telephone, Gray said. One apparently had second thoughts 
about the escape. 
</P>
<P>
"He called his uncle and told him he was distraught by what he had done," Gray 
said, adding that the uncle said he was certain his nephew would turn himself 
in. 
</P>
<P>
Cole and Aitken were discovered in the closet by their fellow guards more than 
an hour later, Gray said. Cole was treated for facial cuts at Downey Community 
Hospital and released. Aitken was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Gray said the escapees are 14 to 17 years old and had been arrested for 
offenses that include burglary and possession and sale of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The escape was only one of a series of gang-related attacks late Friday and 
Saturday that left two men dead. 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, a Huntington Park man was killed by rival gang members who hit him 
with a car and dragged him underneath for 200 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Chavez, 21, described by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies as a "known 
gang member," was standing at Gage Avenue and Loma Vista Place in Bell at about 
10:30 p.m. when a sedan and light-colored pickup truck approached with an 
unknown number of men, Sheriff's Deputy Bill Wehner said. 
</P>
<P>
After a short argument, Chavez escaped from the group, running south on Loma 
Vista Place, Wehner said. 
</P>
<P>
"The suspects got back in their vehicles, caught up with him and he was struck 
by the car and dragged approximately 200 yards," Wehner said. Chavez was 
pronounced dead at St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, another alleged gang member, Jose Leon, 18, was killed and two 
fellow gang members wounded in a drive-by shooting on 42nd Street near Long 
Beach Avenue in South Los Angeles at about 8:30 p.m., Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Leon, shot in the stomach and torso, died at California Hospital. The other 
victims, a 17-year-old male and Juan Lamas, 19, were in stable condition at 
County-USC Medical Center, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's escape at Los Padrinos was the first at the facility since 1987, 
Gray said. Los Padrinos is one of three juvenile detention facilities operated 
by the county. Similar facilities are in Sylmar and Lincoln Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Los Padrinos houses 580 inmates, most of whom are awaiting criminal court 
proceedings. Gray said the facility has a capacity of 410 youths but that the 
overcrowding has not led to serious safety problems.

GIFT OF HELICOPTER WILL KEEP ARCHBISHOP MAHONY ABOVE THE FRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of private donors has given a jet-powered helicopter to Roman Catholic 
Archbishop Roger M. Mahony, who intends to fly it on business trips around the 
sprawling archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony -- who received his helicopter pilot's license last summer -- declined 
to discuss the donation. But a church spokesman said the archbishop will use 
the helicopter to avoid traffic congestion as he conducts the business of his 
office at locations throughout the 8,300-square-mile archdiocese, which 
includes Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. 
</P>
<P>
Acquisition of the helicopter apparently makes the Los Angeles archdiocese the 
only entity of the Roman Catholic church anywhere to own and operate a 
helicopter. Spokesmen for the Vatican and at the Vatican's embassy in 
Washington said Pope John Paul II is flown in helicopters owned by the Italian 
military. 
</P>
<P>
David Moore, executive director of communications for the archdiocese, said, 
"My impression (is) that he expects to use it for inter-diocesan and 
intra-diocesan work." 
</P>
<P>
The archdiocese said that, in preparation for Mahony's anticipated extensive 
use of the helicopter, several Catholic high schools and two seminaries have 
been directed to prepare landing sites. The archdiocese has also embarked on an 
attempt to secure landing rights for Mahony's chopper in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The archbishop lives at the downtown St. Vibiana Cathedral rectory. The donor 
group was organized by prominent Los Angeles attorney Richard J. Riordan, a 
close friend of the archbishop, and involved a gift of the $395,000 aircraft 
and related support services. Riordan said he and four other people -- whom he 
declined to identify -- organized a nonprofit corporation to buy the helicopter 
and give it to Mahony. 
</P>
<P>
Riordan and Moore declined to answer most questions about the helicopter 
acquisition. The archdiocese has scheduled a press conference for Tuesday to 
announce the gift. 
</P>
<P>
Both aviation-safety experts and social activists contacted by The Times raised 
questions about the helicopter acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Morris, a spokeswoman for the Catholic Worker organization, was 
critical of the helicopter arrangement. "It seems like there are a lot of 
fairly important needs in the diocese that $395,000 could help along," Morris 
said. "The problems and needs of the homeless . . . and the refugee and 
immigrant populations far exceed what is being done by the diocese. 
</P>
<P>
"If he (Mahony) is going to set a good example, he'd say, 'Thank you very much' 
and give it (the helicopter) back." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Alice Callaghan, an Episcopal priest and former Roman Catholic nun who 
heads the Skid Row agency Las Familias del Pueblo, also expressed concern. "The 
poor become the touchstone against which owning (a helicopter) must be 
justified," Callaghan said. "If an ethical case can be made, may he fly in 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
Experts on helicopter safety said the skills of a relatively inexperienced 
pilot like the archbishop may be tested to the limit by the demanding 
atmosphere of the urban Los Angeles airspace. 
</P>
<P>
Helicopter industry sources said that, because of the complexities of flying 
here, virtually all pilots in the Los Angeles airspace are professionals. Those 
complexities range from airspace overcrowding to variations in weather 
conditions. Officials of both the McDonnell-Douglas Helicopter Co. and Bell 
Helicopter Textron, the two major manufacturers, said they are aware of just a 
handful of Los Angeles corporate executives who personally fly business 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Schiff, a private Los Angeles-based aviation safety expert, characterized 
helicopters as more demanding and "unforgiving" than fixed-wing aircraft. "It 
(a helicopter) is not the kind of vehicle that amateurs generally fly because 
helicopters require a bit more skill and cunning," Schiff said. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance restrictions on Mahony's flight activity so far prohibit him from 
flying his helicopter alone. He is required to take a certified instructor on 
any flight, according to one of the archbishop's flight instructors. The 
instructor said Mahony is "an excellent pupil" who is "just learning" the 
complexities of the turbine-powered aircraft he is to fly. Mahony took a 
two-hour flying lesson on Wednesday; information on his total flying time was 
not available. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony's helicopter is a 7-year-old Hughes 389D that was owned until late 
January by a Carlsbad aviation service. The gift by the Riordan-organized group 
also includes operating costs, insurance and maintenance. A spokesman for 
McDonnell-Douglas, the Mesa, Ariz., manufacturer of the Mahony craft, said the 
archbishop's helicopter costs about $175 an hour to fly. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony's chopper, said a spokesman for La Jolla Aviation, which previously 
owned the craft, was extensively refitted within the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
Riordan said he negotiated a lease-back agreement with Helinet Aviation 
Services Inc., based at Van Nuys Airport. Under the agreement, Helinet is 
providing flight training and other services in exchange for the right to rent 
the archdiocese's helicopter to private clients -- with the revenue to 
partially offset operating costs for church business. Riordan said the intent 
was to have the lease-back totally offset the archdiocese's operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for Helinet, who asked not to be identified, said 
lease-back arrangements generally cannot recover all of the costs incurred by 
the aircraft owner. 
</P>
<P>
At least three American Catholic dioceses -- Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska, 
and Gallup, N.M. -- own fixed-wing aircraft used to transport bishops and other 
clerics over long distances in often rugged terrain. Enough Catholic clergymen 
fly that there is even an organization called the National Assn. of Priest 
Pilots, which claims a membership of 230 worldwide. A spokesman for the 
association said Mahony is not a member and only one priest other than the 
archbishop -- a U.S. Navy chaplain -- is known to be licensed to fly 
helicopters, 
</P>
<P>
The chaplain, Capt. James Kelley, of the Alameda Naval Air Station, expressed 
concern about Mahony's plan to fly himself around the Los Angeles archdiocese. 
"He could be asking for a lot of trouble," said Kelley, who also holds a 
commercial pilot's license and instructor certificate. Kelly said inexperienced 
pilots -- particularly novice helicopter pilots -- "can just kind of blunder 
into this and that and not even know what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
"Flying a helicopter is no easy task. He (Mahony) has a lot to offer the church 
and it might be better for him to just get a driver and sit and do his work in 
the back of the car." 
</P>
<P>
However, Bishop Francis Hurley, of the Diocese of Anchorage, said he could "see 
a great use for it in Los Angeles considering the communities to which he 
(Mahony) is going." Hurley, who has been a priest-pilot in Alaska for 19 years 
and knows Mahony, said, "I've always thought that a helicopter would be very 
useful in areas of high traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"If you wanted to have a real flight of fantasy, what would happen if he 
(Mahony) kept (the helicopter) at (St. Vibiana) Cathedral and used it to hop 
from parish to parish, other than petrifying all the parents (when he landed)?"

SAN GABRIEL'S PEONY ROLLS ALL THE RIGHT NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peony, 7232 N. Rosemead Blvd., San Gabriel. (818) 286-3374. Open daily from 11 
a.m. to 10 p.m. Beer and wine only. Parking in lot. MasterCard and Visa 
accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $20-$35. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are eager to try more authentic Chinese cooking, but lack 
self-confidence in ordering, will find Peony the perfect place to explore. 
Think of it as a transition restaurant for aspiring Chinese dining experts (see 
Bruce Cost on Page 100). 
</P>
<P>
Michael Chang, a suave, impeccably manicured Hong Kong native, is responsible 
for the restaurant's concept. He comes to the San Gabriel Valley straight from 
a management position at Joss, a new-generation Chinese restaurant in Beverly 
Hills that has stirred up a wokful of opinion among local foodies. 
</P>
<P>
At Joss, Chang served elegantly prepared, artfully conceived Chinese dishes to 
serious eaters, power lunchers and demanding Westsiders. Now at Peony, despite 
a Main Street USA location, Chang is doing exactly the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Chef Vincent Cheng brings heavyweight experience (he was assistant chef at Hong 
Kong's deluxe Regent and Peninsula hotels) to Peony's partially exposed, highly 
efficient kitchen. Cheng's food is both classic and original, with many of his 
dishes so beautifully crafted they look as if they have been embroidered into 
the plates. 
</P>
<P>
Cheng painted the restaurant himself in earth-tone beiges and grays. Walls are 
covered with Chinese reliefs. Lighting is subdued, not harsh. And customers sit 
in boothes, at tables clothed in white linen. Only a row of red-ribboned potted 
plants, and two large fish tanks make you realize you have wandered into a 
Chinese restaurant . . . until you taste the food. 
</P>
<P>
Wonderful and familiar appetizers like country-style egg rolls, pan-fried meat 
dumplings and crispy-fried stuffed bean curd can be ordered from the 140-item 
menu, but there is much more tempting fare. I advise a splurge here, with some 
of Cheng's more expensive and unusual creations. Pin pei chicken, for example, 
makes an incredible treat for four or five. It's a crispy skinned chicken 
served Peking duck-style with little buns, flowered scallions and a rich, dark 
plum sauce. 
</P>
<P>
While some may advise you against ordering soup in a Chinese restaurant, I 
think Peony's soups are terrific. Fish broth with ginger and cilantro, served 
consomme-style, is one of the purest and most delicate sensory experiences I 
have ever had in a restaurant. Double-boiled duck soup with triple delight 
(shrimp, sea cucumber, and shredded duck meat) is delicious enough to make you 
forget the Marx Brothers. Seaweed tofu soup gets the '80s seal of approval; 
it's light and clean, with a healthfully spicy fragrance. Even the well-known 
hot and sour soup is done creatively here, with added chunks of snapper, 
threads of crab, and pieces of fresh shrimp in a seafood stock. 
</P>
<P>
Cheng almost always has the restaurant's tanks stocked with snapper, rock cod, 
lobster and crab. Beyond those four, the fish vary from day to day. My favorite 
dish at Peony is listed as Number 71: diced fish with pine nuts. I have eaten 
it every time I've visited the restaurant (grounds for being sent to critic's 
purgatory). It's made with rock cod, which the chef sautees with garlic and 
green onion. The pine nuts are boiled separately, then added to the wok. 
</P>
<P>
Like Number 71, Peony has several dishes I have never tasted before. Number 59, 
crispy shrimp roll with peach, is minced shrimp in a skin made from dried bean 
curd with a sweet-and-sour sauce made from pureed peach. Number 104, veal ribs 
with black pepper sauce, are soft and tender, with a fiery bite. And the 
excellent Number 85, the divinely sweet specialty called clams with satay 
sauce, has a sauce that is good enough to spoon up all by itself. 
</P>
<P>
More familiar dishes get equal treatment. Standouts include calamari with spicy 
salt, braised chicken with fresh vegetables, Chinese greens with black 
mushrooms and Chinese ham, pineapple seafood fried rice, squab casserole and 
sizzling lobster with shao shing wine. The chef prepares tiny, Hong Kong-style 
dim sum at lunch, and there are boutique Chardonnays like Kendall-Jackson on a 
small wine list, for washing it all down. I wish I had room for all 140 of 
them. 
</P>
<P>

USING THE ARTS TO CONNECT CULTURES; 
</P>
<P>
UNIVERSITY OF JUDAISM PROGRAM SPREADS ETHNIC UNDERSTANDING THROUGH DIVERSE 
PERFORMANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One might think UCLA had opened a new cultural center in Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
The National Ballet of West Java, the Albert McNeil Jubilee Singers and the 
Aman International Music and Dance Company are among those who have appeared in 
a concrete and glass auditorium atop Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
But this eclectic performing arts program -- with an emphasis on ethnic 
offerings -- is part of the University of Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always tried not to be isolated up here on the hill," said university 
Vice President Max Vorspan, who is also the impresario of the program. "The 
arts are a significant bridge, a way to connect and make contact. . . . We 
can't understand Judaism without understanding the culture around us." 
</P>
<P>
That's the philosophy behind the decision to book secular arts into a religious 
institution. The monthly shows, with ticket prices ranging from $10 to $18, are 
aimed at exposing the Jewish community (and anyone else who is interested) to 
culturally diverse performers. 
</P>
<P>
The Khadra International Folk Ballet, for instance, brought the smoldering 
Gypsy music of Moldavia and the acrobatics and colorful costumes of the Ukraine 
to the quiet streets of Bel-Air. The Sudanese Gamelan Orchestra, in conjunction 
with 25 singers and puppeteers, presented the historical Hindu epic "Ramayana." 
And the Chinese Folk Dance Assn. of San Francisco interpreted dances from Yunan 
Province. The university also offers more traditional acts, such as storyteller 
Nehemia Persoff, who revisits the tales of Yiddish humorist Sholom Aleichem. 
</P>
<P>
The performing arts program has a modest annual budget of $117,000. (Ticket 
prices cover the cost of staging shows.) For help in booking and promoting 
shows, officials rely on contacts, such as Irwin Parnes, who founded the Los 
Angeles International Folk Dance Festival at the Music Center in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
And, said Vorspan, "We're always scouring." 
</P>
<P>
Performers appear in the 500-seat Gindi Auditorium, a $1-million facility that 
Times music critic Martin Bernheimer called "an acoustical gem" when he 
reviewed the inaugural show by violinist Itzhak Perlman in 1984. The Gindi is 
also the permanent home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Chamber Music Society, 
which gives most of its shows there. 
</P>
<P>
A sculpture garden is blossoming on the 28-acre campus. Last November, the 
university installed a work by modern artist Jenny Holzer, who uses electronic 
signs and other media to display slogans and aphorisms. The work, "Truism 
Benches," includes slogans such as "Government is a burden on the people" and 
"Confusing yourself is a way to stay honest." Holzer, whose works are included 
in the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art, will 
represent the United States at the 1990 Venice Biennale International 
Exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Bortnick, the coordinator of special programs in the humanities 
department for UCLA Extension, says the cultural offerings at the University of 
Judaism are first-rate, especially since it lacks the size, staff, contacts and 
financial backing of a large university. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's unusual for a smaller-size college to consistently have series 
that have large, leading national figures," Bortnick said. 
</P>
<P>
For those who shape policy at the University of Judaism, the issue of what role 
Jews should play in contemporary Los Angeles is one of crucial importance. The 
influx of immigrants in the last two decades has made Los Angeles a "Third 
World" city, a new Ellis Island with particular resonance for a people who 
themselves immigrated more than a century ago from Western, Central and Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had anything like this since the 1880s," said Vorspan, who is also 
associate professor of Jewish American history at the University of Judaism and 
co-author of "History of the Jews of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
The university plans to enlist its newly established Wilstein Institute for 
Jewish Policy Studies -- a Jewish think tank of sorts -- to look at 
contemporary American ethnicity and its implications for Jewish life. And 
school officials believe the arts offer an important window. 
</P>
<P>
"No art form is an island," Vorspan said, referring to his decision to 
specialize in the ethnic arts. "Each influences and is influenced by the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
The school's administrators worry that the university and its arts programs 
remain a "well-kept secret." Nonetheless, its mailing list goes out to 26,000 
people and, increasingly, performers are playing to capacity crowds. 
</P>
<P>
If Vorspan is the guiding light of the performing arts programs, Rabbi Jack 
Shechter, the dean of continuing education, is the spark behind the school's 
lecture series. Norman Mailer lectured in January. Coretta Scott King will 
discuss black-Jewish relations on March 5 and 6. And Howard Fast, the author of 
"Spartacus" and "The Immigrants," will discuss the saga and achievements of the 
Jews throughout history on April 9 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
The speakers, who focus on Jewish themes, are chosen by Shechter and a 
committee of religious officials and laypeople. The series runs Sundays at 
Valley Beth Shalom in Encino and Mondays at the Sinai Temple in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Today's $20-million campus with 200 dorm rooms is a far cry from the Koreatown 
storefront at 6th Street and Ardmore Avenue where the University of Judaism was 
founded in 1947 as the West Coast branch of the Jewish Theological Seminary. 
</P>
<P>
"We started with half a dozen rabbis sitting around a desk who wanted to 
continue their education," Vorspan said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1958, the university moved to the old Hollywood Athletic Club on Sunset 
Boulevard. Eventually, wealthy donors joined with the Stephen S. Weiss Temple 
and bought a chunk of hillside in the Sepulveda Pass. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, former U.S. Chief Justice Earl Warren spoke at ground-breaking 
ceremonies in the Santa Monica Mountains. Today, 200 students are enrolled at 
the undergraduate Lee College or are earning MBAs, master's degrees in Jewish 
studies or in rabbinical literature and education. There are also 2,200 
students in the continuing education program, which has been known to offer 
such whimsical fare as "Hasidim in Jazz." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the secular is only a small part of the university's offerings, 
most of which deal with Jewish themes. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the school staged the play "My Quarrel With Hersh Rasseyner," 
based on a story by Chaim Grade, the Yiddish storyteller who wrote "Rabbis and 
Wives." The traditional Ellis Island Klezmer Orchestra has made pilgrimages to 
the Bel-Air hillside, and the university once commissioned works on the Jewish 
experience in Eastern Europe from Aman International Music and Dance Co. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the school wants to develop its own drama workshop where aspiring 
playwrights could produce works with Jewish themes. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to create works that are truly our own rather than just bringing 
outside groups in," Vorspan said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Vorspan believes the performing arts program at the University of 
Judaism is still nascent, still struggling to define itself within the backdrop 
of an increasingly diverse Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we've found our voice yet. We need to work out a vision," he 
said.

When are people such as Alex Murashko (Letters, Feb. 5) going to learn that 
real gunplay and reel gunplay are as different as apples and oranges? 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure the producers of "No Retreat, No Surrender II" had no intention of 
bringing to mind the tragic shooting in Stockton. And I'm sure when people go 
to see movies like "No Retreat" or "Rambo," "Commando" and others, the 
tragedies of what they saw on the 6 o'clock news certainly doesn't enter their 
minds. They're going to see a movie, for God's sakes!

VANISHING VINYL

<TEXT>
<P>
You can't stop progress, and I do admit that compact discs can sound pretty 
wonderful . . . but surely there is a place for the vinyl record. 
</P>
<P>
I know I am not alone when I ask that the record companies not give up on a 
format that has been pretty good to them for nearly 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
I get an empty feeling when I think that vinyl albums are almost obsolete; I 
feel like I'm losing a long-time friend. For me, LP albums are like old 
baseball cards: There is a sense of history behind every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
CDs and cassettes are now the desired formats in the music industry. It won't 
be long before only a few of us Neanderthals are left with only a turntable and 
our memories of more innocent days.

We do not want to second-guess Jack Mathews' Academy Award predictions 
(Calendar, Feb. 19) in the acting, writing, directing and best-picture 
categories. However, Mathews' ranking of the best original song nominees is 
another story. 
</P>
<P>
The criteria -- as defined by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 
-- are artistic merit and contributions to the film, which makes the song 
category unique in that the winner is rarely, if ever, lumped into a long list 
of wins for a popular film. 
</P>
<P>
Also, for the past six years, the winning song has not only satisfied the 
category, but has also been a No. 1 pop hit. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Mathews has been swept away in a rush of nominations, but academy voters 
have shown that they award the best original song Oscar not on the basis of how 
many other nominations the film might have, but on the basis of a hit song 
which relates to the film for which it was written. 
</P>
<P>
If Oscar predictions are indeed necessary, wouldn't Calendar readers be better 
served by a music, not film, expert writing about the nominated songs?

 Mathews' predictions: (1) Carly Simon, "Let the River Run," from "Working

"Buster"; (3) Bob Telson, "Calling You," from "Bagdad Cafe."

2 BACIS AREN'T BETTER THAN 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First there was Baci, a pretty little Italian place on Beverly, and now there's 
a Baci on Pico too. They look much the same: pink and celadon color scheme, 
backlighted glass and brick bar, tasteful geometry in the ceiling moldings, 
wrought-iron garden furniture. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, just about everything is the same, and if you know the old Baci, you 
pretty much know the new one, except maybe for the parking situation (in brief: 
It's tough, use the valet service). The new Baci has the same menu, mostly a 
modern Italian selection with about twice as many pastas as meat dishes and 
about twice as many pizzas as pastas. 
</P>
<P>
Why, though, am I blissful about Beverly but paranoid on Pico? 
</P>
<P>
What's to be paranoid about? After all, you've got to love a place that lists 
several burgers, even if they're not major-league burgers -- the one the menu 
calls the Classic is topped with onions, American cheese and . . . pancetta, 
that unsmoked Italian genus of bacon. (Another one, the Baci Burger, comes with 
a Gorgonzola dipping sauce on the side; it's wild, a little like eating your 
burger and a salad with blue cheese dressing in the same bite.) 
</P>
<P>
The reassuring burgers are there because Baci has never pretended to be wholly 
Italian. You also can find a quesadilla on the menu, and semi-American pork 
ribs -- not actual barbecued ribs, but nicely grilled ones -- with a totally 
non-sweet but actually quite traditional American sauce of vinegar, tomato 
sauce, cumin and hot pepper. 
</P>
<P>
So why should I feel the new Baci is . . . not the same? Like the original, it 
serves outstanding fried mozzarella with Parmesan in the breading and a good 
marinara sauce. And it also serves seafood ravioli in a French-type curry cream 
sauce, which is probably the highlight of the menu. 
</P>
<P>
True, true. But there's something ominous about all these reassuring 
appearances. They're like the surface normality of a city invaded by body 
snatchers from space. 
</P>
<P>
Take the most expensive appetizer, shrimp Baci. The problem is not the shrimp, 
which are perfectly OK, if not quite abundant. It's not the good, fresh tomato 
sauce flavored with cilantro, exotic though that may be in an Italian 
restaurant, and not even that the dish has a slovenly look. It's that shrimp 
have no clear business being on the same dish with this sauce. I wouldn't have 
thought it possible, but there are tomato-cilantro sauces that make no sense 
with shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
Or take the calamari appetizer. The thing that was so impressive about the 
calamari at the original Baci was how well-cooked they were, without a speck of 
grease. That can't be said about these oily cephalopods, which are also pretty 
</P>
<P>
flavorless. There were four good eaters at my table, but only half these 
calamari got eaten. 
</P>
<P>
You can tell me it's the same dish, the same recipe and everything, but I know 
better. These are not the same calamari. Could they have been cooked by Pod 
People who are used to eating methane and graphite? 
</P>
<P>
And what about this pizza? I associate the color of this crust with redwood 
bark (well, to be fair I've also seen it on some takeout pizzas). Pasta can get 
overdone too. It certainly was in my rigatoni borghese (nice idea for a sauce, 
though: tomato, cream, spinach and nutmeg). The calzone with four cheeses is 
certainly tasty, but I'm darned if I can taste more than one cheese, 
Gorgonzola; or maybe one-and-a-half, because there's probably some Parmesan in 
it. And the "warm chicken salad" is a pretty lukewarm idea. What is this 
dressing, vinaigrette with protein concentrate or what? 
</P>
<P>
Desserts are a different matter. True, among the French-type fruit tarts I've 
had one that seemed suspiciously like a space alien's best guess as to what a 
tart should be: a tough, dry pie shell filled with some soft custard topped 
with slices of not-quite-ripe cantaloupe. 
</P>
<P>
But the rest are quite good, things like a rich and sloppy tirami su and a 
decent coconut-flavored cheesecake. And the tarte tatin is the second-best I've 
had in L.A., with perfectly cooked apples, pudding-soft and caramel-brown. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this is a genuine Baci where the kitchen has somehow not 
pulled itself together. The place gets crowded, so a lot of people must like 
it. 
</P>
<P>
If they are actual people, that is. Forgive my paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended dishes: fried mozzarella, $4.95; Baci burger, $7.95; spareribs, 
$8.75; seafood ravioli, $9.50; tarte tatin, $3. 
</P>
<P>
 Baci, 9233 Pico Blvd., Los Angeles. (213) 205-8705. Open for lunch from 11:30 
a.m. Monday through Saturday, for dinner daily from 5:30. Beer and wine. Valet 
parking. American Express, Carte Blanche, MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner 
for two, food only, $29 to $46.

DEVELOPERS FIND PEACE AT A PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With his swank new Westside hotel sitting empty and losing a reported $800,000 
a month, developer Sheldon Gordon struck a desperate deal. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon wrote a check for $250,000 to a group of Los Angeles homeowners that had 
dragged the project through months of tedious hearings. He also dropped 
$800,000 into a bank account -- to be controlled by him and the homeowners -- 
to find more parking. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners, in return, consented to leave the Ma Maison Sofitel alone. 
Within weeks, Gordon was entertaining celebrities at his $50-million hotel, and 
the homeowners were setting up a "neighborhood preservation fund" with their 
pot of gold. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Seen the Light' 
</P>
<P>
"They have seen the light," Harald Hahn, one of the homeowners, proclaimed 
after signing the agreement. "We made them see the light." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, speaking later to a reporter, was contemptuous. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's the American way, I am crazy," he said. "It was blackmail." 
</P>
<P>
However appalling to developers, the pay-out in Los Angeles last fall reflects 
the increasing boldness with which community groups across the state are 
pushing builders to dig deep into their pockets in the name of neighborhood 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
The legacy of development disputes in the 1980s, many builders and residents 
say, can now be measured in dollars and cents. The old compromises -- a shorter 
high-rise or a smaller condominium project -- are often no longer enough for 
residents, who say they cannot rely on unresponsive local governments to look 
out for their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be very little give and mostly take," said one Los Angeles 
attorney who represents developers in negotiations with community groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Legal Tab 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, developers are being asked by residents -- and they are agreeing -- 
to subsidize their own opposition. It has become an unwritten rule in many 
areas that builders pick up the tab when they reach an agreement with residents 
who have hired attorneys, consultants and other experts to dissect their 
proposals. The bills can run into the tens of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In discussions that end less amicably, residents sometimes use money paid to 
them by one developer to take on another. For example: 
</P>
<P>
* Hahn and his group have already received requests from several homeowner 
organizations -- including one near the controversial Westside Pavilion 
shopping mall 4 miles from the hotel -- to spend Gordon's money in their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
* In the San Joaquin Valley, a small Tulare County citizens group opposed to a 
proposed cogeneration plant in Hanford last year settled a lawsuit against the 
developer for $100,000 and is using the cash to pursue a separate suit against 
the same developer. "We have money now, so people are quaking in their boots," 
said Marcie Williams, who heads Citizens for a Healthy Environment. 
</P>
<P>
* San Franciscans for Reasonable Growth, a residents group concerned about 
downtown expansion, reportedly received more than $500,000 from developers 
several years ago in exchange for settling separate lawsuits over proposed 
skyscrapers. The group paid its bills but also used the money to prepare for 
the next developer, founder Sue Hestor said. "You kind of just recycle your 
money," she said. 
</P>
<P>
* In West Los Angeles, the Friends of Westwood homeowners group collected 
$150,000 for attorney and other costs when it sued to block construction of a 
high-rise on Wilshire Boulevard. Having already raised some money from its 
members, the group had an estimated $20,000 to $40,000 from the settlement left 
over for other causes. Among other things, Friends of Westwood donated $2,000 
to a Hollywood group that sued to block the city's redevelopment project there. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the state, there is a widespread perception among community groups 
that government has not been doing enough for residents -- leaving them to fill 
the void. Many trace the phenomenon to government cutbacks after Proposition 
13, the tax-cutting measure of 1978. 
</P>
<P>
With state and local governments spending less money on things like streets and 
parks, there has been "a trickling down" of responsibility, as one Sacramento 
observer explained it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expensive Proposition 
</P>
<P>
"It has become very expensive to do what we do," said Sandy Brown, co-founder 
of Friends of Westwood and a signer of the agreement with Ma Maison Sofitel. 
"It is something homeowner associations never had to contend with before. . . . 
I don't think the development community should have to give money to anybody, 
but on the other hand I don't think the residential community should have to 
hire experts to defend itself." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, vice president of the Westside Civic Federation, a coalition of homeowner 
associations, said community groups have had little choice but to look out for 
their own needs. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be perceived as being here to milk the developers," he said. 
"But on the other hand, the city isn't doing a whole lot to protect us, so we 
have to protect ourselves. It points out a real weakness in our political 
system." 
</P>
<P>
Faced with income losses, city and county governments statewide have pressed 
builders to pick up some of the tab by imposing various fees and requiring them 
to install such things as traffic signals and left-turn lanes. 
</P>
<P>
But in many instances, influential developers twist arms at City Hall and wind 
up providing fewer amenities than local residents would like. In other cases, 
tax-hungry cities and counties approve projects despite local opposition 
because they see them as moneymakers. In these cases, residents complain, they 
have been abandoned by their elected representatives. 
</P>
<P>
"What the citizens realize is that in the relationship between developers and 
elected decision makers, there aren't really any good safeguards that assure 
the citizens have in fact gotten their due," said Mike Remy, a Sacramento 
land-use attorney and former professor of environmental studies. "This gives 
citizens an incentive to take things into their own hands." 
</P>
<P>
And that has been expensive for many groups. Many builders, recognizing that 
residents often cannot afford this watchdog role, often do not mind picking up 
the bills in friendly negotiations. The added costs, developers say, are 
eventually passed on to consumers in everything from higher meal prices in 
hotels to more costly homes and offices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pushing for a Solution 
</P>
<P>
"By definition, the community would not experience the cost but for the 
developer's project, so the developer ends up saying, 'OK,' " said Douglas R. 
Ring, a Century City attorney who represents developers. "The developer is 
always pushing for a solution that does not require him to reduce the size of 
the project he has planned, because the economics, if you will, flow with the 
larger project." 
</P>
<P>
Across the state, community groups find they have extraordinary leverage with 
developers who have large amounts of money wrapped up in a project or strict 
deadlines to meet. Residents can delay projects for months -- if not years -- 
by tying them up in government hearings or in court. And in the building 
industry, delays mean more attorney fees, higher interest payments, lost 
revenues and, in extreme cases, bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day that passes is a costly day for the developer," said Kenneth B. 
Bley, who represented the developer in the Friends of Westwood case. "So you 
have to look at the bottom line. It makes more sense to try to resolve a matter 
quickly even if it means paying a few extra dollars. And both sides know this." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, community groups angling for cash have not always found it easy. Such 
deals have offended developers and residents alike, particularly when the 
agreements receive great scrutiny because of widespread publicity. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Joaquin Valley, Williams said her group faced "a lot of hard 
feelings" over the $100,000 settlement. An editorial in the Hanford Sentinel 
newspaper suggested that the Tulare County group change its name to "Citizens 
for a Healthy Environment Except When the Price Is Right." The editorial 
charged that the settlement showed the group's "true interest lies not in the 
warm green shades of nature, but in the crisp green color of folding cash." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Legal Extortion' 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, Hestor's group has been accused by some developers of "legal 
extortion" and, at one point, former Mayor Dianne Feinstein asked the district 
attorney to look into the allegations. Hestor said the "smear campaigns" have 
made her think twice about asking for money. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe it is extortion, but I don't want to take the heat," Hestor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, both Gordon and the homeowners he negotiated with have taken a 
thrashing in the Ma Maison Sofitel case. 
</P>
<P>
"To me it stinks," said Ethel Shapiro, a West Hollywood homeowner who lives 
near Gordon's hotel. "It is a payoff. If they were that concerned about 
parking, they wouldn't have allowed themselves to be bought off." 
</P>
<P>
Others have raised concerns that the homeowners gave up too much in the deal by 
agreeing, among other things, not to oppose the hotel's request to serve 
alcoholic beverages. In newsletters to fellow homeowners, Hahn and Diana 
Plotkin, the lead negotiators, wrote that "none of our future rights to enter 
into the process have been waived" and that their associations "retained the 
right to continue to monitor the hotel and address all concerns which will 
impact the community." 
</P>
<P>
But the confidential agreement, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, 
clearly restricts the homeowners' ability to take on the hotel in the future. 
The agreement prohibits the homeowners from taking "any action at any time" to 
change the hotel's parking requirements, occupancy limits or license to serve 
alcohol unless the hotel itself requests a change. Moreover, the homeowners 
agreed not to oppose the hotel in any court-ordered environmental proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Plotkin defended the deal: "We did the best job we could. We 
did a hell of a lot better than the people in West Hollywood. . . . I know 
there are always going to be critics. There are a lot of people who are 
jealous. There are a lot of people who are angry." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Action Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Gordon has also come under attack because of the hotel agreement, according to 
several developers and land-use attorneys who asked not to be identified. By 
paying the "ransom," as one of them characterized the payment, Gordon opened 
the door to more "hostage situations" for other developers. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, sources said, at least one other developer near the hotel has already 
been approached by homeowners about making a contribution -- perhaps as high as 
$250,000 -- to the neighborhood fund. Other developers apparently have cash 
payments on their minds too. In Westwood, Brown said she was told up front by 
one builder, "I am not going to give you one red cent," even though she never 
asked for any money. 
</P>
<P>
There is concern among some developers that groups in California, if encouraged 
by lucrative cash deals such as the Ma Maison Sofitel payment, may become as 
difficult to deal with as a highly controversial citizens group in Washington 
state. In the last year, an aggressive citizens environmental organization has 
shaken King County in the Seattle area by tying up proposed projects until 
developers agree to stiff environmental requirements and hefty cash 
settlements. 
</P>
<P>
The founders of the Hestia Alliance, named for the Greek goddess of hearth and 
home, reportedly received $500,000 in a settlement with the developers of a 
proposed housing and apartment complex near their home. 
</P>
<P>
"We make no bones about it," said Tom Evans, the group's attorney, who would 
not confirm the amount of the settlement. "We go into these battles with the 
intention of obtaining funds to pay for furthering the goals of the 
organization. . . . Developers are truly interested in better mitigation (of 
damage to the environment), but unless someone comes along and applies the 
pressure, none of this stuff is going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
King County developers have complained bitterly about the group's tactics, 
accusing it of creating "an assembly line extortion machine," in the words of 
critic Peter L. Buck. At least one developer has refused to pay. Dick Van der 
Peyl, whose company wants to build several hundred apartments in King County, 
said he agreed to Hestia's environmental requests but turned down the group's 
demand for $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Had Been Shaken Down' 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I had been shaken down," Van der Peyl said. "We are willing to 
give legitimate documented expenses . . . but they just flat out demanded 15 
grand from us before even having done any environmental work on the project." 
</P>
<P>
In California, few groups seems to be interested in cash alone. In many cases, 
the "extractions," as one attorney called developer concessions, come in "cash 
equivalents." Some community groups do not need or want money. Some, 
particularly in more affluent areas, have attorneys, engineers and other 
professionals among their members who volunteer their services, or leaders who 
work on neighborhood issues so often that they have become experts themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In some neighborhoods, it is a matter of ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Hoag Canyon homeowners in Bel-Air said they rejected a $150,000 offer from a 
developer who flattened a nearby mountain ridge without any notice to area 
homeowners. Instead, the Roscomare Valley Assn. held out for an agreement that 
requires the developer to rebuild part of the ridge and pay about $40,000 in 
lawyer and engineering fees. 
</P>
<P>
"Our particular homeowner group was offended by the offer," Mark Slade said. 
"It is really up to the individual homeowner group how they feel about it. This 
is a way of doing business throughout the city. . . . We always felt the 
objective was to save Hoag Canyon as much as possible. Mitigation funds of any 
kind were not our objective. In fact, we found it distasteful." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deal Falls Through 
</P>
<P>
In the hills above Sherman Oaks, a homeowner group helped craft a proposed 
agreement with the developer of a housing tract that called for a $500,000 
contribution to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to purchase land in the 
area. Richard Close, who heads the Sherman Oaks homeowners group, said some 
residents had ethical problems with the deal, which ultimately fell through for 
other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We did have some moral questions raised in our minds, but we never had to make 
the hard decision," Close said. "We made it clear up front that the money would 
not go to the homeowners association, that it had to go to a third party. 
Still, you have the moral question of whether it is right to agree to a project 
in which substantial dollars are being given to a group. Is that any different 
than a developer making a large contribution to council people?" 
</P>
<P>
In planned communities, which are common in suburban settings such as Orange 
County, many homeowner and condominium associations are precluded by their 
bylaws from accepting or spending money outside their maintenance 
responsibilities. In such cases, members negotiate with developers for sound 
walls, palm trees, wider driveways or traffic signals. 
</P>
<P>
Other community groups statewide work closely enough with developers -- and get 
enough concessions -- that they see no need to stow away cash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Park 
</P>
<P>
In the Miracle Mile area of Los Angeles, cordial negotiations between residents 
and the developer of a six-story office building on Wilshire Boulevard netted 
the community a two-acre private park where the developer had proposed building 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
The park cost developer Jerry Snyder $750,000 as well as annual maintenance 
expenses -- more money, several residents said, than any homeowner group could 
have hoped to extract in cash. Snyder also agreed to give the Miracle Mile 
Residential Assn. a free office in the building for five years. 
</P>
<P>
Lyn MacEwen Cohen, who negotiated the agreement for the homeowners, said she 
never asked for money. 
</P>
<P>
"We really don't have much need for funds," she said. "What we have is a 
wonderful park." 
</P>
<P>
The developer of a shopping center near Marina del Rey, confronted by nearby 
condominium owners opposed to alcohol sales at the center, agreed to provide an 
overnight private security patrol in the neighborhood for three years. The 
service will cost the developer between $30,000 and $50,000 a year, but he 
would have lost far more than that if his project had been denied its liquor 
licenses. Meanwhile, the neighborhood got a service it had wanted for many 
years but could not afford. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chinatown Center 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, a downtown developer has agreed to contribute $500,000 to a 
recreational center in Chinatown, while a developer in a rural Solano County 
consented to set aside open space to win support from residents for his 
project. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles Harbor area, the developer of a condominium project has 
agreed to build a senior citizens center, and in Brentwood, the J. Paul Getty 
Trust will pay $300,000 to homeowners near its proposed arts center so they can 
erect gates to keep traffic out of their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The list goes on and on, particularly in the Los Angeles area, where "every 
acre is being fought over," according to San Francisco attorney Mark 
Weinberger, who represents community groups across the state. 
</P>
<P>
And both developers and homeowners say they are bracing for more. 
</P>
<P>
"The sophisticated developer of the 1990s is going to be the developer who 
understands how to communicate with homeowners just like the successful 
developer of the 1950s was the person who understood how to mass-produce in 
large volume cheaply," said Ring, the Century City attorney. "The developer who 
is the dinosaur is the guy who says, 'It is my property. I can do what I please 
with it, and the hell with them.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, the Los Angeles homeowner leader, made a similar prediction. 
</P>
<P>
"If a developer is a bandit, you have to watch out for us," he said. "If you're 
a bastard, you get treated like one."

<P>
Federal investigators began an inch-by-inch inspection Saturday of the fuselage 
around a truck-sized hole that ripped out the side of a United Airlines Boeing 
747 near Hawaii and hurled nine passengers to their deaths from more than 
20,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Searchers crisscrossed the Pacific Ocean but found no bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking hopefully for survivors," Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler 
said. "But, you know, a normal human being just can't last that long, even in 
70-degree waters. Plus they fell 22,000 feet." If anyone lived through the 
fall, Spangler said, chances for survival were slim. He said the sea was 
infested with sharks. 
</P>
<P>
At least one of the victims was sucked into the whirling blades of a jet 
engine. The blades were bent, and a medical examiner found "multiple small body 
parts" inside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Search for Clues 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 investigators, headed by Lee Dickinson, a member of the National 
Transportation Safety Board, swarmed through the plane trying to discover why a 
cargo door and part of the fuselage came apart early Friday as the aircraft 
climbed up and away from Honolulu International Airport and turned toward 
Aukland, New Zealand, carrying 357 people. 
</P>
<P>
A hundred miles south of Hawaii, the door and a section of metal above it tore 
out of the fuselage and the jumbo jet decompressed. In addition to the 
passengers who were sucked out, 27 others, including several crew members, were 
hurt by flying debris. Two engines failed, and pilot David Cronin returned and 
landed the jet like a lead sled -- hard but safely. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third in a recent series of structural failures on Boeing planes. 
Last April, the top of a 737 peeled off during an Aloha Airlines flight from 
Hilo to Honolulu, killing an attendant and hurting 61 others. In December, an 
Eastern Airlines 727 was forced down in West Virginia after a 14-inch hole 
opened its fuselage. Nobody was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Dickinson said his team would investigate every possibility to determine the 
cause of the latest accident. "All doors are completely wide open," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But he said his experts would pay particular attention to the cargo door and 
its locking mechanisms -- and the aircraft cargo area. By nightfall Saturday, 
the Coast Guard had not recovered the door, and Dickinson said the chances of 
finding it diminish with each passing hour. He said the door was one thing 
investigators would especially like to see. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Federal Aviation Administration called the attention of airlines 
operating 747s to an instance in which a cargo door opened partially in flight. 
It said this could "result in rapid decompression of the airplane." The FAA 
ordered the airlines to reinforce cargo door locks with steel plates. 
</P>
<P>
The agency gave the airlines until next Dec. 31 to complete the modification. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modification Not Made 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether locks had been reinforced on the United jet, Russell Mack, 
the airline's vice president of corporate communications, said the modification 
had been made on six of the 25 United 747s in the same model series. But Mack 
added: "This plane had not been done." 
</P>
<P>
Reporters were taken to within 100 feet of the plane. It was clear that its 
cargo door, hinged at the top, had lifted cleanly from the bottom of its 
aperture and had been torn off the airplane -- hinge and all -- taking part of 
the fuselage with it and ripping a jagged edge along the upper part of the hole 
it left behind. 
</P>
<P>
Strips of metal aircraft skin had been peeled away and were hanging from the 
top of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
Through the hole, the passenger floor was clearly visible. Some seats were 
still attached. 
</P>
<P>
The cabin ceiling had fallen and parts that were not sucked out still filled 
the aisles with debris. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of Dickinson's team will talk to flight crew members, including 
Cronin, a 34-year veteran pilot whom United hailed as a hero for bringing the 
severely damaged jet and its 348 remaining occupants down safely. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its damage and the lack of power from two of its four engines, Cronin 
landed the aircraft with nothing more than a hard jolt -- and some ruptured 
tires. 
</P>
<P>
The first officer was G. A. (Al) Slater. R. M. (Mark) Thomas was the second 
officer. All three men are based in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The flight had 15 attendants, credited by passengers with maintaining calm on 
the plane. The attendants are based in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Some investigators have been assigned to document survival factors: the type, 
severity and cause of the injuries suffered; how the cabin flew apart, and 
rescue efforts on the ground. Still others will study the plane's maintenance 
records. Others will check its engines. And another group will review the 
contents of its cockpit voice and flight data recorders. 
</P>
<P>
Dickinson said neither he nor any members of his team will try to offer any 
explanation shedding light on the accident for several weeks. "We will not be 
making any causal determinations while we are here on scene . . . " he said. 
"But (eventually) we will figure out what happened and why." 
</P>
<P>
Other aviation experts also were focusing attention on the cargo door, its 
locks and surrounding structure. Although representatives of Pratt &amp; 
Whitney, which made the engines on the jet, are aiding the investigation, 
experts say its two engine failures are probably the result of foreign-object 
ingestion from the fuselage blowout. 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely, these experts said, that the engine failures caused the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI also was assisting in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Special Agent Harlan Frymire said the bureau was looking into "several calls 
claiming responsibility" for the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
But he said such calls are typical after a spectacular incident. 
</P>
<P>
None of the calls "dovetailed" with other information authorities had, Frymire 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interviews Completed 
</P>
<P>
He said agents had finished interviewing all passengers, crew members and other 
airline employes with access to the plane -- such as baggage handlers -- and 
had found "no irregularities." 
</P>
<P>
No one who was supposed to have boarded Flight 811 in Honolulu failed to do so 
and hence might be responsible for bombing the plane, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he added: "We still consider the cause to be undetermined." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Navy and Coast Guard almost doubled their search area to cover 
3,000 square miles of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard cutter recovered "what appeared to be part of the fuselage" 
Friday night, spokesman Spangler said. The 4-by-6-foot piece of metal was 
turned over to investigators, along with several smaller pieces of debris. A 
Navy helicopter reported spotting what appeared to be a luggage rack Saturday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Spangler said most of the debris was spotted in water 88 miles south-southwest 
of Honolulu Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that's floating, we're picking up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Searchers speculated that large pieces of debris probably sank in the 
15,000-foot-deep ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Spangler said three helicopters, two planes and four vessels would continue 
combing the sea until nightfall, then decide whether to resume at daybreak. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals in Honolulu reported treating 27 people, mostly for minor injuries. 
Five remained hospitalized Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the plane, 200 passengers boarded other flights. Those who did 
not want to continue were put up in hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The nine passengers missing and presumed dead were identified as: Anthony and 
Barbara Fallon of Long Beach, Calif.; Harry and Susan Craig of Morristown, 
N.J.; Rose Harley of Hackensack, N.J.; Mary T. Handley of Bay City, Mich.; Lee 
Campbell of Wellington, New Zealand, and Dr. John Michael Crawford and John 
Swann, both of Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
All had been seated in the business-class section of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
United towed the damaged 747 to Hickam Air Force Base, adjacent to Honolulu 
International Airport, and concealed it from public view. 
</P>
<P>
The jumbo jet is 18 years and three months old. After 20 years of service, 
Boeing says, its jets need increased inspections and repairs because they crack 
more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
Here, compiled by the Associated Press, are recent incidents involving airliner 
aging and metal fatigue: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jan. 20, 1989. A Piedmont Airlines 737 dropped an engine shortly after 
takeoff from Chicago. None of three passengers and crew were injured and the 
plane landed safely. The aircraft was seven years old, but authorities blamed 
metal fatigue and a cracked bolt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sept. 21, 1988. An American Airlines 727 made a belly landing at Dallas-Ft. 
Worth after metal fatigue in its landing gear prevented the pilot from opening 
the wheel well door. The 88 passengers and crew evacuated with three people 
injured. Boeing had recommended inspections eight days earlier after finding 
metal fatigue in the same area in other 727s. 
</P>
<P>
 -- May 9, 1988. A 20-year-old American Airlines 727 was forced to make an 
unscheduled landing at Detroit after a 15-inch crack in a wheel well caused a 
drop in cabin pressure. None of the 112 aboard were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dec. 5, 1987. An engine fell off a USAir 737 in Philadelphia, causing no 
injuries. The FAA ordered inspection of engine-mount bolts on some 737s.

Investigators trying to discover what ripped a truck-sized hole in the side of 
a United Airlines Boeing 747 near Hawaii said late Saturday they could find no 
evidence of a bomb. They reported that the accident, which killed nine 
passengers, could have been caused by a cargo door which gave way because of 
air pressure inside the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Marx, senior metallurgist for the National Transportation Safety Board, 
said, however, that there was no indication of any extraordinary pressure or 
weight load on the cargo door. 
</P>
<P>
When asked why the door gave way, Marx replied: "Did you ever bust a balloon" 
by blowing it up over and over again? 
</P>
<P>
He declined to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
Marx said there were no signs of metal fatigue or corrosion on cargo door locks 
that were still on the plane. But he would say nothing about whether there was 
an indication that any latches failed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pacific Crisscrossed 
</P>
<P>
As investigators pored over the aircraft, searchers crisscrossed the Pacific 
Ocean looking for survivors. "You know, a normal human being just can't last 
that long, even in 70-degree waters -- plus they fell 22,000 feet," Coast Guard 
spokesman Keith Spanger said. If anyone lived through the fall, Spangler said, 
chances for survival were slim. 
</P>
<P>
He said the sea was infested with sharks. 
</P>
<P>
At least one of the victims was sucked into the whirling blades of a jet 
engine. The blades were bent, and a medical examiner found "multiple small body 
parts" inside. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 investigators, headed by Lee Dickinson, a member of the NTSB, 
swarmed through the plane trying to discover why a cargo door and part of the 
fuselage came apart early Friday as the aircraft climbed up and away from 
Honolulu International Airport and turned toward Aukland, New Zealand, carrying 
357 people. 
</P>
<P>
A hundred miles south of Hawaii, the door and a section of metal above it tore 
out of the fuselage and the jumbo jet decompressed. In addition to the 
passengers who were sucked out, 27 others, including several crew members, were 
hurt by flying debris. Two engines failed, and pilot David Cronin returned and 
landed the jet like a lead sled -- hard but safely. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third in a recent series of structural failures on Boeing planes. 
Last April, the top of a 737 peeled off during an Aloha Airlines flight from 
Hilo to Honolulu, killing an attendant and hurting 61 others. In December, an 
Eastern Airlines 727 was forced down in West Virginia after a 14-inch hole 
opened its fuselage. Nobody was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Dickinson said his team would investigate every possibility to determine the 
cause of the latest accident. "All doors are completely wide open," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But he said his experts would pay particular attention to the cargo door and 
its locking mechanisms -- and the aircraft cargo area. By nightfall Saturday, 
the Coast Guard had not recovered the door, and Dickinson said the chances of 
finding it diminish with each passing hour. He said the door was one thing 
investigators would especially like to see. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Federal Aviation Administration called the attention of airlines 
operating 747s to an instance in which a cargo door opened partially in flight. 
It said this could "result in rapid decompression of the airplane." The FAA 
ordered the airlines to reinforce cargo door locks with steel plates. 
</P>
<P>
The agency gave the airlines until next Dec. 31 to complete the modification. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modification Not Made 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether locks had been reinforced on the United jet, Russell Mack, 
the airline's vice president of corporate communications, said the modification 
had been made on six of the 25 United 747s in the same model series. But Mack 
added: "This plane had not been done." 
</P>
<P>
Reporters were taken to within 100 feet of the plane. It was clear that its 
cargo door, hinged at the top, had lifted cleanly from the bottom of its 
aperture and had been torn off the airplane -- hinge and all -- taking part of 
the fuselage with it and ripping a jagged edge along the upper part of the hole 
it left behind. 
</P>
<P>
Strips of metal aircraft skin had been peeled away and were hanging from the 
top of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
Through the hole, the passenger floor was clearly visible. Some seats were 
still attached. 
</P>
<P>
The cabin ceiling had fallen and parts that were not sucked out still filled 
the aisles with debris. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of Dickinson's team will talk to flight crew members, including 
Cronin, a 34-year veteran pilot whom United hailed as a hero for bringing the 
severely damaged jet and its 348 remaining occupants down safely. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its damage and the lack of power from two of its four engines, Cronin 
landed the aircraft with nothing more than a hard jolt -- and some ruptured 
tires. 
</P>
<P>
The first officer was G. A. (Al) Slater. R. M. (Mark) Thomas was the second 
officer. All three men are based in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The flight had 15 attendants, credited by passengers with maintaining calm on 
the plane. The attendants are based in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Some investigators have been assigned to document survival factors: the type, 
severity and cause of the injuries suffered; how the cabin flew apart, and 
rescue efforts on the ground. Still others will study the plane's maintenance 
records. Others will check its engines. And another group will review the 
contents of its cockpit voice and flight data recorders. 
</P>
<P>
Dickinson said neither he nor any members of his team will try to offer any 
explanation shedding light on the accident for several weeks. "We will not be 
making any causal determinations while we are here on scene . . . " he said. 
"But (eventually) we will figure out what happened and why." 
</P>
<P>
Other aviation experts also were focusing attention on the cargo door, its 
locks and surrounding structure. Although representatives of Pratt &amp; 
Whitney, which made the engines on the jet, are aiding the investigation, 
experts say its two engine failures are probably the result of foreign-object 
ingestion from the fuselage blowout. 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely, these experts said, that the engine failures caused the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI also was assisting in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Special Agent Harlan Frymire said the bureau was looking into "several calls 
claiming responsibility" for the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
But he said such calls are typical after a spectacular incident. 
</P>
<P>
None of the calls "dovetailed" with other information authorities had, Frymire 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interviews Completed 
</P>
<P>
He said agents had finished interviewing all passengers, crew members and other 
airline employes with access to the plane -- such as baggage handlers -- and 
had found "no irregularities." 
</P>
<P>
No one who was supposed to have boarded Flight 811 in Honolulu failed to do so 
and hence might be responsible for bombing the plane, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he added: "We still consider the cause to be undetermined." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Navy and Coast Guard almost doubled their search area to cover 
3,000 square miles of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard cutter recovered "what appeared to be part of the fuselage" 
Friday night, spokesman Spangler said. The 4-by-6-foot piece of metal was 
turned over to investigators, along with several smaller pieces of debris. A 
Navy helicopter reported spotting what appeared to be a luggage rack Saturday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Spangler said most of the debris was spotted in water 88 miles south-southwest 
of Honolulu Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that's floating, we're picking up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Searchers speculated that large pieces of debris probably sank in the 
15,000-foot-deep ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Spangler said three helicopters, two planes and four vessels would continue 
combing the sea until nightfall, then decide whether to resume at daybreak. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals in Honolulu reported treating 27 people, mostly for minor injuries. 
Five remained hospitalized Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the plane, 200 passengers boarded other flights. Those who did 
not want to continue were put up in hotels. 
</P>
<P>
United towed the damaged 747 to Hickam Air Force Base, adjacent to Honolulu 
International Airport, and concealed it from public view. 
</P>
<P>
The jumbo jet is 18 years and three months old. After 20 years of service, 
Boeing says, its jets need increased inspections and repairs because they crack 
more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
Here, compiled by the Associated Press, are recent incidents involving airliner 
aging and metal fatigue: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jan. 20, 1989. A Piedmont Airlines 737 dropped an engine shortly after 
takeoff from Chicago. None of three passengers and crew were injured and the 
plane landed safely. The aircraft was seven years old, but authorities blamed 
metal fatigue and a cracked bolt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sept. 21, 1988. An American Airlines 727 made a belly landing at Dallas-Ft. 
Worth after metal fatigue in its landing gear prevented the pilot from opening 
the wheel well door. The 88 passengers and crew evacuated with three people 
injured. Boeing had recommended inspections eight days earlier after finding 
metal fatigue in the same area in other 727s. 
</P>
<P>
 -- May 9, 1988. A 20-year-old American Airlines 727 was forced to make an 
unscheduled landing at Detroit after a 15-inch crack in a wheel well caused a 
drop in cabin pressure.

IMPORTED GUNS: JUST WHAT IS A SPORTS WEAPON? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of foreign military-style assault weapons are being 
imported into the United States despite a federal law that prohibits the 
importation of any firearm that is not for "sporting purposes." 
</P>
<P>
The 1968 Gun Control Act makes it illegal to import any firearm unless it is 
"generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to 
sporting purposes. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms uses that law to ban cheap 
foreign-made handguns and some other firearms, but Israeli Uzis, Chinese AK-47s 
and other foreign-made assault weapons are pouring into the country with the 
approval of federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ban Held Possible 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the law is being properly applied," said Rep. Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City), who has introduced legislation to ban the possession, sale, 
manufacture and importation of assault weapons. "These are not weapons that can 
be reasonably construed as having legitimate sporting functions. And I think 
the existing law could easily be applied to ban the (importation of) civilian 
versions of the Uzis and AK-47s. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), author of a similar bill on the state 
level, said that after learning of the federal importation law he is drafting a 
state resolution to ask the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to 
re-evaluate its policy of allowing Uzis and AK-47s into the country. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Uzi and the AK-47 -- semiautomatic versions of fully automatic 
military rifles -- are increasingly used by drug dealers and youth gangs on the 
streets of Los Angeles and other American cities, according to law enforcement 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The weapons have been used routinely in street crimes that often get little 
attention outside the areas in which they occur, law enforcement officers say. 
But the firearms have also been used in widely reported mass murders. 
</P>
<P>
An Uzi was among the weapons used in San Ysidro on July 18, 1984, by a deranged 
gunmen who killed 21 people and wounded 15 others at a McDonald's restaurant. 
And a Chinese AK-47 was used in the Jan. 17 attack in a Stockton schoolyard 
that left five children dead and 30 wounded in a matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Chinese Model 
</P>
<P>
More than 88,000 AK-47s, most of them from China, were imported into the United 
States from January, 1985, through November, 1988, according to federal data. 
About 75,000 Uzi carbines have been imported from Israel since 1980, according 
to Action Arms Ltd. of Philadelphia, sole U.S. importer of the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms officials say their policy of allowing 
importation of Uzis and AK-47s as sporting weapons is based on a decision made 
20 years ago by the Treasury Department firearms evaluation panel, which held 
meetings during a two-month period in December, 1968, and January, 1969, and 
then disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau, in a written response to questions from The Times, said the federal 
firearms panel did not examine Uzis or AK-47s, but determined that several 
civilian models of other military weapons made in foreign countries "had a 
particular use in target shooting and hunting." 
</P>
<P>
"It was recommended that these types of semiautomatic versions of . . . 
military rifles be approved for importation," the bureau statement said. The 
bureau said that years later it used that evaluation in deciding to permit 
importation of Uzis and AK-47s as sporting weapons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Saturday Night Specials' 
</P>
<P>
But a former member of the federal firearms panel told The Times that the 
six-member body paid scant attention to the importing of foreign rifles and 
concentrated instead on handguns in an attempt to screen out cheap "Saturday 
night specials." 
</P>
<P>
Harold E. Johnson, a former Army weapons expert and now a private firearms 
consultant, said the federal panel looked briefly at four semiautomatic 
versions of foreign military rifles to make sure that they were not readily 
convertible from semiautomatic to fully automatic fire. 
</P>
<P>
(A fully automatic weapon, also called a machine gun, fires a steady stream of 
bullets with a single pull of the trigger. A semiautomatic weapon fires one 
bullet for each pull of the trigger.) 
</P>
<P>
The panel did not try to determine whether the rifles were suitable for 
sporting purposes, said Johnson, but the particular weapons examined "were 
basically (suitable as) target rifles and relatively expensive. . . . There was 
a lot of interest (in these rifles) in match shooting and a lot of collector 
interest. But they were never used in crimes that I know of because they were 
too big and expensive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Expensive Types 
</P>
<P>
As for the smaller, less expensive imports such as the Uzi and AK-47, Johnson 
said: "Nobody had ever thought about those. They weren't imported back in those 
days." 
</P>
<P>
The question of what constitutes the sporting purposes of a firearm has become 
a central issue in the increasingly heated debates over proposed federal, state 
and local legislation to outlaw assault weapons. Opponents of the firearms say 
they are instruments of death, specifically designed to kill human beings. 
Their defenders say they are not only collectors' items and guns that are 
useful for self-defense, but also are suitable for sporting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
What are the sporting purposes of a firearm? 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said a weapon must be suitable for 
hunting or target shooting to be a sporting firearm and therefore importable. 
Target shooting, said the bureau, does not include what is called "plinking" -- 
shooting at tin cans. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of handguns, the bureau uses objective criteria developed by the 
Treasury Department firearms evaluation panel to determine whether the weapons 
are importable. The criteria, meant to prohibit importation of cheap handguns, 
include such features as barrel length, weight, caliber, safety mechanisms and 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Criteria 
</P>
<P>
But for rifles and shotguns, few such objective importation criteria exist. 
</P>
<P>
To be importable for civilian use, a rifle -- like other weapons -- cannot be 
capable of automatic fire. Neither can it be readily convertible to fully 
automatic fire -- a judgment that is somewhat less objective. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there are the highly subjective hunting and target shooting questions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms denied importation of a 
South African riot shotgun called the Striker 12, maintaining that the weapon 
had little hunting or target shooting value. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau was unimpressed with the applicant's argument that "combat shotguns 
are importable because they have sporting use, such as bowling pin shooting 
competitions." 
</P>
<P>
The effect of the importation ban, however, was short-lived. A copy of the 
Striker 12 was soon produced domestically by an Atlanta company that called it 
the Street Sweeper. It is advertised to the American public as having "awesome 
firepower, 12 rounds in less than three seconds." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From Favored Nations 
</P>
<P>
But neither the Uzi nor the AK-47 has been forced to undergo such a domestic 
reincarnation. In the case of the Chinese-made AK-47, domestic production would 
almost certainly cause an increase in price due to the higher cost of American 
labor. The prices of both weapons are held down somewhat because both China and 
Israel enjoy "most favored nation" status as trading partners of the United 
States and pay low import fees. 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of assault weapons argue that some of the firearms, such as the 
American-made AR-15 and M1A, are popular and effective target rifles. 
</P>
<P>
But are the Uzi and the AK-47 suitable for target or hunting purposes? 
</P>
<P>
First, the Uzi. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular model of the Uzi, made by Israel Military Industries, is the 
carbine. It is a civilian copy of the submachine gun named after Uziel Gal, who 
began development of the weapon for the Israeli armed forces in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
The civilian version, like the military model, is a compact black rifle with a 
folding stock that allows it to be fired from the hip as well as the shoulder. 
With the stock folded, the import-model carbine is only 24.4 inches long, and 
the ease of concealment causes concern among law enforcement officials. The 
weapon holds magazines containing up to 32 rounds of 9-millimeter ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controlled in Israel 
</P>
<P>
Although Americans in most states can buy the Uzi carbine across the counter, 
it is not available to most civilians in Israel, where strict gun control laws 
are in effect, according to Ilan Mor, spokesman for the Israeli Consulate in 
Los Angeles. He said an exception is made for residents of settlements under 
threat of terrorism, who may be issued weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The Uzi carbine -- which sells for $500 to $700 -- was first introduced into 
the United States for the civilian market in 1980 after several models were 
rejected by federal authorities as too easily convertible to fully automatic 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
While the weapon finally approved for importation is not easily converted into 
a fully automatic rifle, independent entrepreneurs have put a conversion kit on 
the American market with which to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody with any mechanical ability should (be able) to do it in an hour," 
said a federal weapons expert, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Such fully automatic Uzis subsequently began turning up in the hands of 
criminals, but many of the conversion kits, which have been deemed illegal, 
have been confiscated and the supply seems to be drying up, said the federal 
weapons expert. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Collector Customers 
</P>
<P>
C. B. Stern, operations manager for Action Arms, importer of the Uzi, said that 
two-thirds of the customers who answer a company questionnaire said they bought 
the weapons as collectors' items. 
</P>
<P>
"The other third," he said, "is everything between home protection, plinking, 
target shooting, self-defense . . . survival -- some people think Armageddon is 
around the corner and they want to be ready." 
</P>
<P>
As for target shooting -- one of the sporting criteria for importation -- the 
Uzi, with its 9-millimeter pistol ammunition and short 16.1-inch barrel, 
doesn't have the range or accuracy for rifle competition, gun experts say. 
</P>
<P>
The public education division of the National Rifle Assn. indicates that Uzis 
are not used in the national championship large-bore rifle competitions, 
co-sponsored by the NRA. Neither is the weapon suitable for any kind of serious 
hunting, gun experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Ammunition magazines for the Uzi, which contain 20 to 32 bullets, are illegal 
under the hunting regulations of some states that limit the amount of 
ammunition a rifle may hold. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not for Killing Animals 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Upholt, executive director of the California Wildlife Federation and the 
California Sportsman Lobby, said the Uzi does not have the range for hunting 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of anybody that uses an . . . Uzi to go hunting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As head of the Sportsman Lobby, Upholt opposes abolition of assault rifles. He 
said that rather than being a hunting weapon, the Uzi is "more suitable for 
protection of the home and for recreation. . . . A lot of people like to go out 
in the country and set up cans. . . . People love to plink with it." 
</P>
<P>
The real appeal of the Uzi carbine to the non-criminal buyer, say many gun 
experts, is its aura as an Israeli commando weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"These are real fantasy toys (for) cabbage patch commandoes," said a federal 
gun expert who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Holt, general manager of B &amp; B Sales, a popular gun store in North 
Hollywood, said of the weapon: 
</P>
<P>
"The Uzi is designed to break in the door and kill everybody." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enter the AK-47 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese AK-47 arrived on the American scene in 1984, four years later than 
the Uzi, but it seems to have overtaken the Israeli weapon in popularity, 
probably because many models are cheaper -- selling for less than $300 -- and 
because the AK-47 is much more powerful. 
</P>
<P>
The AK-47 was developed as a fully automatic submachine gun by Mikhail 
Kalashnikov for Soviet troops shortly after World War II and subsequently was 
adopted by the armed forces of other Communist Bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
There is inescapable irony in the importation into the United States of the 
civilian version of the weapon. Twenty years before an AK-47 was used by a 
crazed gunman to kill Asian-American schoolchildren in Stockton, the military 
version of the weapon was used by North Vietnamese troops to kill American 
soldiers in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
The AK-47 is being exported by a poor Third World communist country to a 
wealthy capitalist nation, where it is used with increasing frequency by black 
gang members to kill other impoverished blacks on the streets. While the weapon 
is readily available in U.S. cities, strict gun-control regulations in China 
prohibit ordinary citizens in urban areas from possessing AK-47s, or anything 
comparable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holds 30-Round Clips 
</P>
<P>
The AK-47 comes equipped with three banana clips, each holding 30 rounds. Drum 
magazines holding up to 100 rounds are also available. A bayonet is frequently 
included. Some models have folding stocks that make them more easily 
concealable. 
</P>
<P>
The main importers of the AK-47 are China Sports Inc. of Santa Fe Springs and 
Keng's Firearm Specialty Inc. of Riverdale, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
The annual Complete Book of Assault Rifles magazine said in its 1989 issue that 
a dozen special "National Match AK-47s," equipped with 20.9-inch barrels and 
accurate enough for target competition, have been imported from China. 
</P>
<P>
But the standard AK-47 with its short 16.3-inch barrel and 7.62x39-millimeter 
ammunition does not have the range or the accuracy to satisfy most serious 
competitive shooters. 
</P>
<P>
None of the competitors in last year's national championship large-bore rifle 
competition, co-sponsored by the National Rifle Assn., used an AK-47, according 
to the NRA's public education division. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people who buy the guns use them to plink with," said Steve 
Langford, marketing director of China Sports. "It is a gun that can be fun to 
shoot." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overkill for Game 
</P>
<P>
Langford said the AK-47 is also used to hunt small- and medium-size game. But 
the AK-47, while powerful enough to rip through one side of a car and out the 
other in a drive-by shooting, is considered a marginal hunting weapon because 
of its lack of range and accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Some hunting enthusiasts give the AK-47 a lukewarm endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Upholt of the California Wildlife Federation said he does not know anyone who 
uses an AK-47 for hunting, although he noted that it is only slightly less 
powerful than the lever-action 30-30, which is used for hunting deer at 
relatively close range. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be used for that purpose," said Upholt, who then expressed the view 
of most hunters: "I prefer a bolt action." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Klein, a chief game warden in Northern California with the state 
Department of Fish and Game, said his officers have not encountered AK-47s in 
the field, but he has received reports of hunters with such weapons buying deer 
hunting licenses. 
</P>
<P>
"They acquired a gun and want to go deer hunting, but they're not deer 
hunters," Klein said. "It's a trendy type of thing. Most deer hunters have 
their favorite guns that they've been using a long time, not some Russian thing 
that shows up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regulation Problems 
</P>
<P>
As with the Uzi, the AK-47 also encounters the problem of regulations in some 
states, other than California, that limit the number of bullets that can be 
held in a hunter's rifle. Hunting magazines that hold five rounds may be 
ordered for AK-47s, but are not standard equipment, gun dealers say. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the practical and legal questions, there is a philosophical issue in 
using an AK-47 with a 30-round banana clip to hunt deer.

A court in Florence, Italy, convicted seven people, including five organized 
crime figures, in a 1984 train bombing that killed 16 Christmas travelers and 
wounded more than 200. A panel of judges acquitted two people after ruling 
there was insufficient evidence to tie them to the Dec. 23 bombing of an 
express train as it passed through a tunnel between Florence and Bologna. Five 
of the defendants were sentenced to life in prison, including Giuseppe (Pippo) 
Calo, an alleged Sicilian Mafia crime figure. The other two received 25- and 
28-year terms. The prosecution alleged that the defendants wanted to use the 
bombing to distract authorities investigating organized crime.

The Federal Aviation Administration proposed an $801,000 fine against Northwest 
Airlines for safety violations, including the use of Boeing jumbo jets on 8,198 
flights without a required engine bolt inspection. Northwest was also charged 
with making unauthorized repairs on two 747s and failure to comply with a dozen 
other FAA rules and directives. The proposed fine amounts to an FAA settlement 
offer, which will take effect if the airline does not object. Alleged 
violations were initially outlined in a Feb. 17 letter to Northwest President 
John F. Horn., the FAA said. William Slattery, Northwest executive vice 
president for operations, described the problems as primarily "instances of 
inadequate record-keeping and differences in interpretation."

ELUSIVE NEUTRINOS THOUGHT TO BE KEY TO FUTURE OF UNIVERSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two of the most esoteric fields of science are joining in a marriage that could 
help determine whether the universe will go on expanding forever or ultimately 
collapse on itself in a final big bang. 
</P>
<P>
Physicists who are building a new generation of multimillion-dollar instruments 
to detect gravity waves are joining with astronomers who are trying to measure 
what may be immeasurable -- a subatomic particle so small it defies 
imagination, but so numerous that if it has even a little mass it may well 
determine the future of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
The marriage of these two very different fields could produce quality data that 
"we can really believe in," said UCLA professor David Cline, the prime mover 
behind the program. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the universe is believed to be made up of mysterious "hidden matter" 
that cannot be seen. Cosmologists speculate that if there is enough hidden 
matter, the force of gravity will be so great that the universe eventually will 
stop expanding and finally collapse. 
</P>
<P>
But what could be massive enough to cause the universe to ultimately contract, 
and yet still remain invisible? 
</P>
<P>
Some theorists believe the answer might lie in neutrinos, which are 
manufactured continuously when stars like the sun burn their fuel. Neutrinos 
are also created in great bursts when stars explode or collide. It was, in 
fact, just such an explosion that brought several dozen experts to Los Angeles 
last week for a symposium hosted by UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discover Supernova 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, an exploding star, called a supernova, was discovered in the 
southern sky, and it was the brightest supernova seen in 400 years, according 
to historical records. The discovery sent astronomers around the world 
scrambling for their instruments to witness one of nature's most spectacular 
shows, and it has spawned several major new areas of research because a 
supernova is one of nature's rarest laboratories, offering a view deep into the 
heart of the physics of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists who have studied the supernova have found that most of their earlier 
theories have stood the test well. Just as the theories suggested, the 
supernova has demonstrated that exploding stars produce the heavy elements that 
make up so much of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, scientists have discovered what they had expected to find at the 
center of the supernova, a spinning neutron star called a pulsar that sends off 
energy like a spinning lighthouse. But no one expected the pulsar to be 
spinning as rapidly as it apparently is: 2,000 times a second. 
</P>
<P>
That rapid spin rate is one of the bigger surprises in Supernova 1987A, which 
is in a nearby galaxy called the Large Magellanic Cloud, about 170,000 light 
years away. 
</P>
<P>
Equally important, however, was the discovery that the supernova was sending 
out neutrinos. In all, 20 neutrinos were detected in two large detectors, one 
in Japan and the other in Ohio. That alone was considered a significant 
achievement, since neutrinos do not have an electrical charge and thus are 
extremely difficult to capture. Trillions of them are constantly passing 
through the Earth without ever touching anything, but occasionally one collides 
with an atom in a neutrino detector, and the debris from that collision tells 
scientists something -- but not much -- about neutrinos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Enough Data 
</P>
<P>
So while the detection of neutrinos from Supernova 1987A was somewhat of a 
triumph, the data gained was not adequate to determine whether neutrinos have 
enough mass to be significant in the cosmological question concerning the fate 
of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
And that set UCLA's Cline to thinking. Cline, who teaches both physics and 
astronomy, decided that if he could get the gravity wave physicists working 
with the neutrino astronomers, they might collectively solve one of the great 
problems of modern astronomy. 
</P>
<P>
The way to determine whether a neutrino has any mass is to figure out the speed 
at which it travels. If it has no mass, it would be a packet of pure energy, 
traveling at the speed of light. Even a slight mass would slow it a little. 
</P>
<P>
For Supernova 1987A, scientists tried to determine the speed of the neutrinos 
on the basis of the time of the sighting of the explosion. Since they arrived 
at Earth at virtually the same time as the visible light, the 20 detected 
neutrinos did not have enough mass to be significant. 
</P>
<P>
But all 20 of those were of one type, called electron neutrinos. There are two 
other types, called the muon and tau neutrinos, which are stronger candidates 
for having significant mass, and which were not detected from Supernova 1987A. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Detectors Planned 
</P>
<P>
More-sensitive detectors are planned for the years ahead, but even if muon and 
tau neutrinos can be detected, there remains the problem of determining how 
long it took them to get here. 
</P>
<P>
And that brought the gravity physicists and the neutrino astronomers together 
last week for the UCLA conference. 
</P>
<P>
A number of major gravity wave detectors are being planned around the world, 
including a $100-million joint project by Caltech and MIT that the National 
Science Foundation is expected to finance. The new detectors should be 
sensitive enough to detect gravity waves created by a supernova. 
</P>
<P>
In his General Theory of Relativity, Albert Einstein postulated that some 
events, such as colliding or exploding stars, would send out bursts of 
radiation in the form of gravity waves. That concept has become generally 
accepted among physicists, although no one has been able to prove it. The hope 
is that the next generation of gravity detectors, especially the one planned by 
Caltech and MIT, will be sensitive enough to detect them. 
</P>
<P>
Since gravity waves travel at the speed of light, the difference between the 
time that gravity waves are detected and the time that neutrinos are detected 
would offer a precise way of determining the mass of all three types of 
neutrinos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Network of Detectors 
</P>
<P>
Cline and the other scientists who were at the UCLA symposium are trying to 
establish a framework for gravity wave detectors scattered around the world to 
work in concert with the equally scattered neutrino detectors. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to do it now," said Stanford University physics professor William 
Fairbank. "This could become a very exciting program." 
</P>
<P>
The neutrino detectors could be put on alert as soon as the gravity wave 
detectors report their first hits. That would ensure that all the data from 
that period would be preserved for future study. 
</P>
<P>
If the neutrinos arrive simultaneously with the gravity waves, as many 
scientists expect, that will rule them out as candidates for the "missing 
mass," and scientists can start looking for something else. If they arrive 
sometime later -- and that could even be a year later if the supernova is far 
enough away -- it will mean that these tiny, illusive elements will have the 
last word on the future of the universe.

Ted Warmbold, editor of the San Antonio Light, died Saturday after a 10-day 
illness at the age of 45. 
</P>
<P>
Warmbold, former executive editor of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, also held 
executive titles with newspapers in Rochester, N.Y., San Bernardino and Dallas. 
He had been the chief news executive at the Light since joining the newspaper 
in June, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"Ted was the most talented editor I have had the privilege of working with 
during my almost 25 years in the newspaper business," said publisher George B. 
Irish. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Warmbold died at Humana Metropolitan Hospital after a bout 
with cryptococcal meningitis. 
</P>
<P>
The disease is an opportunistic infection in people whose immune system is 
weakened, including victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or patients 
undergoing intensive chemotherapy or bone marrow transplants, said Dr. Ron 
Kennedy, a researcher at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attended Seminary Schools 
</P>
<P>
A native of St. Louis, Warmbold attended various seminary schools before 
transferring to the University of Missouri School of Journalism, where he 
received his degree. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, Warmbold was named assistant managing editor at the Rochester Democrat 
and Chronicle and, in 1972, Gannett named him managing editor of the San 
Bernardino Sun-Telegram. 
</P>
<P>
He left Gannett in 1975 and became assistant managing editor of the Dallas 
Times Herald and the following year became executive editor of D Magazine, the 
city magazine of Dallas and Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, the Hearst Corp. hired him as executive editor of the Herald Examiner 
and in 1981, Hearst named him executive editor at the Light. He was promoted to 
editor in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, his mother, three sisters and two brothers. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral Mass will be celebrated Monday at San Fernando Cathedral in San 
Antonio. Burial will be in St. Louis.

KEY ARENA FINANCING TIED TO SIGN RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The financial linchpin of computer entrepreneur Harry G. Cooper's plans to 
build a privately funded $120-million sports "palace" in San Diego involves his 
ability to persuade a company to spend as much as $40 million to have the arena 
named after it. 
</P>
<P>
If that cash-for-your-name-in-neon idea proves to be a difficult sell -- and 
Cooper, arguing that companies will be fighting for the privilege, insists that 
it won't -- the plan to construct the 22,900-seat arena without public funds 
could disintegrate. At the very least, the financing certainly would become 
more problematical, Cooper admits. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the key -- there's no doubt about that," said the La Jolla resident, 
who hopes the new arena will lure professional basketball or hockey franchises 
to San Diego. "It's the reason I was able to stand up in front of the city and 
say that I wasn't going to ask for any public money. The sign deal is an 
integral part of the whole financing package." 
</P>
<P>
Patterned after Los Angeles Lakers' owner Jerry Buss' estimated 
$1-million-a-year contract with Great Western Bank that resulted in the Forum 
being renamed the Great Western Forum last December, the deal envisioned by 
Cooper and his partner, Richard Esquinas, is designed to raise as much as 
one-third of the arena's estimated construction cost through what essentially 
would be a corporate advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Under Cooper's plan, a company would sign a 20-year agreement that, in exchange 
for an annual price that he estimates at between $1.5 million and $2 million, 
would allow the firm's name to be incorporated into the arena's name -- as in, 
for example, The Widget Palace. Besides being placed on the complex itself, the 
company's name would also appear on tickets for all arena events, parking lot 
marquees, the basketball court or ice, and perhaps even on each seat. 
</P>
<P>
Far from being merely an expensive bit of corporate ego gratification, the sign 
plan, Cooper and Esquinas contend, makes solid business and advertising sense. 
</P>
<P>
"This is much, much more than just putting a name on a building, like some 
banks do for prestige," Cooper said. "Of course, prestige is involved here, 
too, because every time a game is broadcast from the palace, the company's name 
</P>
<P>
would be mentioned. But the name's also going to be on tickets and signs, so 
there will be a lot more exposure." 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary analyses by Cooper and Esquinas suggest that the deal could be as 
cost effective, if not more so, as conventional print and broadcast media 
advertising. If, for example, near-sellout crowds filled the arena for, say, 
150 games, concerts and other events a year, more than 3 million people would 
be exposed to the company's name on multiple occasions -- while looking at the 
tickets, entering the building, on the seats. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, tens or hundreds of thousands of automobiles will daily pass the 
arena, expected to be built either downtown or on a 38-acre site that Cooper 
owns in the so-called Golden Triangle of Sorrento Valley. An estimated 200,000 
cars pass by the Sorrento Valley site daily, Esquinas said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Real, Strong Case' 
</P>
<P>
"After doing some numbers crunching, you can make a real strong case for this 
and see that the cost-per-exposure would be low," Esquinas said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, why does Cooper believe that any company would be willing to pay 
perhaps twice as much to attach its name to a San Diego arena as was paid by 
Great Western in glitzier, more-populous Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
"Because our sports palace will be newer, bigger (by about 5,000 seats) and 
more attractive," Cooper said matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
Though other stadiums and arenas have been named after financial benefactors -- 
among them, Busch Stadium, Pauley Pavilion and Rich Stadium -- sign deals such 
as that contemplated by Cooper and Esquinas are a relatively new concept in 
corporate advertising. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arco Agreement 
</P>
<P>
In a deal similar to the one that gave the Forum its Great Western prefix, Arco 
agreed to pay about $600,000 a year to have the arena where professional 
basketball's Sacramento Kings play known as the Arco Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Such arrangements, Esquinas argues, are a logical extension of corporate 
sponsorship of sporting events and athletes' promotional affiliation with 
companies, the latter being very familiar to television viewers thanks to the 
small corporate logo patches positioned on athletes' outfits to attract maximum 
camera exposure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely the wave of the future," Esquinas said, echoing those who 
believe that the ready availability of corporate dollars will make commercial 
names for sports arenas increasingly common in the 1990s. "We're not the first, 
but it's all still new enough that we'll probably be setting an example for 
others." 
</P>
<P>
To assess the level of interest in their proposal, Cooper and Esquinas plan to 
solicit bids from about 100 large U.S. companies next month and hope to have a 
contract signed by January, 1990. Any contract likely would be structured on a 
contingency basis, with different tiers of payments based on whether the arena 
ultimately houses a National Basketball Assn. team, a National Hockey League 
franchise, both -- or neither. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, there's still a signage value even without a franchise," Cooper 
assistant Larry Kallett said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cooper -- a cautious businessman who has parlayed the millions that he 
made in the computer industry into a substantially larger personal fortune 
through land investments -- has said that construction of the arena, which he 
hopes to open in 1992, might not even start until he is confident of receiving 
an NBA or NHL franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, getting the maximum amount for signage depends on getting a team," 
Cooper acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Guidelines 
</P>
<P>
Cooper has established few guidelines in his search for a corporate partner, 
other than saying he hopes to attract a "class company" to lend its name to the 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt that I'd go for the Tidy Bowl Palace," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
"And you probably won't see it being named the Preparation H Arena or 
Kaopectate Arena, either," Esquinas chimed in, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
After a well-timed pause, Cooper chuckled and added: "Of course, if they 
offered $5 million a year, I might have to reconsider."

COMMENTARY; 
</P>
<P>
THE ART OF TAKING RISKS FOR ART'S SAKE IS VERY CRUCIAL IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEEB SALZER, Beeb Salzer is a drama professor at San Diego State University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Artists take risks. A life in art is not only a shaky way to earn a living, but 
each creative act is also an exercise in exposure. Standing nude in Horton 
Plaza is nothing compared to the nakedness of painting a picture or writing a 
poem. Then a critic tells the world whether or not the artist's bare soul has 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians, on the other hand, trying to please as many constituents as 
possible, play it safe. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between the artist and the politician makes wise politicians 
distance themselves from decisions on government funding of the arts. The 
political risks are too great. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the upcoming San Diego City Council vote on whether the Public 
Services and Safety Committee gets first crack at the arts allocations is 
meaningless because the real damage was done when the council foolishly 
demanded that it have the final say on who gets money for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
This situation may exist some other place, but I can think of no other body of 
elected officials who have willingly made themselves targets for the wrath of 
disgruntled artists, self-styled champions of wise government spending and any 
assortment of crazy-cause flakes. 
</P>
<P>
We can reasonably expect that arts funding in San Diego will now become a 
combination of the divisiveness that has accompanied the renaming of Market 
Street and the convention center and the scandals that made our city a joke in 
the art world when the Board of Port Commissioners turned down three 
sculptures. Referenda are sure to follow. No wonder then, that the new 
Commission for Arts and Culture is proceeding with caution and in a very 
strange direction. 
</P>
<P>
With the council looking over its shoulder, the commission recently announced 
that it would apportion money based on an art group's annual budget and the 
excellence of its management. The commission's chairman said that funding 
panels will not review artistic quality. 
</P>
<P>
An arts commission that doesn't consider artistic excellence? 
</P>
<P>
Another member of the commission said audience size and fund-raising success 
are a measure of artistic excellence. Untrue. Grant writing, audience 
development and fund raising are sales skills. 
</P>
<P>
Under the commission's guidelines, Michael Jackson would beat out Mozart, and 
LeRoy Neiman would win over Cezanne. Taking this formula to its logical, but 
ridiculous, extreme, if this commission were funding theologians, they would 
favor Jim and Tammy Bakker over Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
No one denies that judgments about artistic quality are difficult. National, 
state, and city funding bodies that use artistic excellence as a factor in 
making grants -- and most do -- are not universally popular. 
</P>
<P>
A commission that will not take risks does not give us confidence that it will 
support artists who do. But that is one of the qualities it should be looking 
for in those applying for grants. 
</P>
<P>
Will the commission tackle big questions? Will it devise ways to enrich our 
artistic life by including Mexican, African and Asian arts? Will it be bold 
enough to fund experiments and young promising artists? Will it fearlessly 
support work that is critical of society and artists who expose the bigotry and 
racism in San Diego? Can it preserve the large institutions and at the same 
time encourage new ones? Will it lobby for artist's housing, rehearsal space, 
arts programs in the schools? 
</P>
<P>
A timid commission that doesn't judge excellence will be forced to use 
peripheral standards, such as an art's value as a tourist attraction or its use 
in a public relations contest with other cities. That is like having a fancy 
car in the driveway to impress the neighbors, but never driving it to get 
anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
A further problem is the perception that, by not considering artistic merit, 
the commission is not being fair. The commission was already regarded 
skeptically by many in the arts community, who believed that the mayor and the 
council appointed political friends, some of whom represent one or another of 
the major arts groups in town. Recognizing these affiliations, small groups and 
individuals fear they'll be cut out of the funding process. 
</P>
<P>
The commission must address these well-founded concerns by publicly stating its 
responsibility to represent all citizens, all the arts and all the artists of 
San Diego. To act otherwise would be a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
To give funds based on the excellence of an organization's management or its 
attendance figures merely perpetuates the status quo, and we end up with a 
welfare system for the arts rather than a vision for positive change. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, many arts institutions already have a welfare mentality, "Give 
us money simply because we are needy." When have we heard them argue for 
support based on the value of their art to the public? Their unwillingness or 
inability to articulate a philosophical reason for government to fund their 
work is a contributing factor to the vacuum in the artistic life of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
When the mayor partially filled that vacuum with her ill-considered "Year of 
the Arts" speech, heads of arts organizations were aghast. Some of the larger 
institutions might have attempted to guide the mayor or, failing that, have 
criticized her plans in public statements. Instead, greed and fear of 
retribution turned them into sycophants, unwilling to tell the empress she had 
no clothes and unable to suspend their rivalries, join together and aid the 
city to formulate an intelligent policy. 
</P>
<P>
Taking a long view, I know from history that artists have often been courtiers. 
Shakespeare had to flatter Queen Elizabeth and Moliere humored Louis XIV. But 
we live in a democracy and should not have to fawn on our officials. 
</P>
<P>
The arts, especially in a democracy and particularly if they are to receive 
public funds, are obligated to tell the truth. We need the arts for precisely 
that reason: to show us the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it seems to me that we have lost a thread of continuity when money 
becomes so important to art. Art springs from religion, not commerce. Art and 
religion ask many of the same questions about our nature as human beings, our 
relationship to those infinite forces that confound us, and our treatment of 
one another. Art is now more metaphorical than religion, and it is certainly 
more subversive, in the political sense and in the original Latin meaning of 
turning things upside down. 
</P>
<P>
Art turns things upside down so that we see them in a new way, a changed 
perspective. Because this is of value to society, one of the commission's 
criteria for funding should be that an arts group or artist speak to questions 
that force us to consider our humanity, our role in the universe and the nature 
of society in new ways. 
</P>
<P>
Going back to the same Latin root of subversion, vertere, to turn, there is 
another kind of art, a diversion. This art turns us away from thinking of the 
large questions. It is the tired businessman's art, a way of forgetting one's 
problem. When awarding grants, the Commission for Arts and Culture should 
realize that diversions are often able to support themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Were the Soviet Arts Festival, "The Year of the Arts" and the Commission for 
Arts and Culture intended as diversions? It doesn't matter now. The curtain has 
risen on a new show and a much needed spotlight has been focused on the arts in 
San Diego. The leading players are the power-hungry mayor and council, the 
politicized commission and the greedy arts groups. Who will be the hero and who 
the villain? Will anyone demonstrate wisdom, vision, unselfishness or honesty? 
And who will take risks? 
</P>
<P>
The paradox is -- as every artist knows and politicians do not -- that taking 
risks is the only way to be safe.

GUN BILLS MERIT S.D. SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The idiocy of civilian ownership of military-type assault rifles became so 
tragically obvious when five children were killed and 29 were injured at a 
Stockton elementary school that it's hard to believe that most of the San Diego 
County legislative delegation could be lukewarm toward proposals to ban the 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when these 11 members of the state Assembly and Senate should be 
vigorously working to outlaw the weapons, only four favor a ban. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest support comes from Sen. William Craven (R-Oceanside). The former 
Marine has supported gun owners in the past, but he understands that there is 
no legitimate place outside of the military for the type of weapons that 
increasingly are being used in drive-by shootings and against law enforcement 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San Diego) is co-sponsor of an Assembly bill banning 
sale of the weapons. In addition, Assemblywoman Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) and 
Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-Chula Vista) say they favor some form of ban. 
</P>
<P>
The Times found that San Diego's other legislators were either vague about what 
they would support or that they favor prohibiting only violent criminals or the 
mentally ill from owning the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Restricting gun ownership for violent criminals and the mentally ill makes 
sense for handguns and rifles. But military assault weapons, designed to kill 
human beings with rapid efficiency, call for more than half-measures. 
</P>
<P>
The bills sponsored by Senate Majority Leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) 
and Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), which would ban the manufacture and 
sale of military-type assault rifles in California, are more than 
half-measures, and they deserve the full support of San Diego's delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Such support could be crucial this week when the Assembly Public Safety 
Committee votes on the Roos bill. The committee vote is expected to be 
particularly tight, and support from newly elected Assemblywoman Carol Bentley 
(R-El Cajon) could be the difference that makes a difference. 
</P>
<P>
Bentley, who represents a district with 5,200 National Rifle Assn. members, 
says she does not support the Roos/Roberti bills because she fears they might 
outlaw some hunting and sportsman rifles. 
</P>
<P>
The bills make a good-faith effort to protect sportsmen's guns, and we would 
encourage Bentley and other members of the delegation to look beyond those 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than basing a decision on the wishes of target shooters, we would urge 
the legislators to listen to the advice of law enforcement officials around the 
state, and to the cries of those whose friends and family have been gunned down 
by these combat weapons. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, San Diego's legislators should close their ears to the 
twisted logic of Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego), who argues that banning 
assault weapons would hurt poor people and minorities who need the weapons to 
protect themselves. They should also shut out the hysteria of the NRA, which 
contorts the Constitution and argues that civilians need to be familiar with 
assault weapons in case of war. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti and Roos, both from gang-plagued Los Angeles, know all too well about 
drive-by shootings with semiautomatic weapons. San Diego's gang problem is 
minor by comparison. By supporting Roberti's and Roos' bills, San Diego's 
delegation can help ensure that it doesn't get worse.

TELEVISION ARREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was with sad resignation that I read about Paul Bloom, Channel 39's reporter 
for the "Crime Watch" program, and his decision to have William Hammond 
arrested during a television interview ("Activist Couple Question Ethics of TV 
Reporter in On-Camera Arrest," Feb. 11). 
</P>
<P>
Bloom has been dropped as anchorman and now appears to be joining a growing 
trend toward sensationalist (I hesitate to use the word) journalism. In his 
defense, Bloom avers that Hammond was "a wanted criminal" and he was only doing 
his civic duty by setting up the public arrest of this man. It also seems clear 
that Bloom believed this leader of San Diego's homeless to be a "dangerous" man 
who should be returned to prison. 
</P>
<P>
One can only wonder, then, that if these assertions are true, why didn't Bloom 
urge Hammond's immediate arrest prior to air time? Surely if the authorities 
felt him to be a major threat to society, hopefully they wouldn't have waited 
until the taped interview. To wait, however, until the time of the interview 
and then in a coordinated fashion have the arrest be the highlight of the 
program can only underscore the desire of this reporter to join in a growing 
trend with others who seek to be more TV "personalities" than empirical, 
critical and professional purveyors of the news.

FORMER TRUANTS TRAIN FOR MARATHON; 
</P>
<P>
STUDENTS PUT LIVES ON NEW TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Aliso High School senior Cesar Morquecho said he only used to run when he was 
being chased. Even then, he couldn't run far. "I used to smoke cigarettes," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Morquecho and five classmates -- all former truants and identified as 
incorrigibles -- are running out of bad habits. Instead of ditching school, 
these continuation high school students are putting in extra hours training to 
run in the Los Angeles Marathon next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the marathon, "getting a diploma is a piece of cake," said 
Morquecho, 18, a Reseda resident. 
</P>
<P>
"Their attitudes have changed tremendously," said Paul Trapani, an Aliso High 
School social studies teacher who has directed the students' marathon training 
since fall. "They are more positive, more supportive and much more 
cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 100 or so students at Aliso High in Reseda enter as potential 
dropouts. They've left their regular high schools because of academic and 
behavior problems, Trapani said. At continuation schools, students get more 
individual attention in academic subjects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conditioning Class 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Trapani said, he decided to add running to the curriculum. He 
talked nearly a dozen students into signing up for a conditioning class that 
started in September. 
</P>
<P>
Trapani, who teaches history, economics and government, wrote a contract for 
each of his students pledging them to attend twice-a-week workouts and to 
complete two 5-kilometer runs and one 10-kilometer run. The students earn five 
elective credits if they finish the course; the marathon is optional. 
</P>
<P>
Since the class started, several have quit, two have been injured, but only one 
of the remaining students has decided not to try the marathon, Trapani said. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to develop self-awareness, that if you set out with a goal, you 
have to work to complete it," Trapani said. 
</P>
<P>
Six of Trapani's students, five boys and one girl, will get a chance at 
completing the 26.2-mile run. 
</P>
<P>
Trapani's students said they never thought much of running and still find it 
hard to believe that they are in the race. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time we had to run a mile, it was incredible torture," said senior 
Nick Merelle of Reseda. "Now I can run 12 to 15 miles." 
</P>
<P>
To reach that kind of mileage, the students have been running as a group after 
school and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Getting them into the proper frame of mind was as tricky as getting them into 
running shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I came here, my counselor said to me, 'There's no way you're going to 
graduate,' " said Merelle, 18. "The teachers here said, 'Yes, you can.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defeatist Attitude 
</P>
<P>
Students have usually adopted a defeatist attitude by the time they transfer to 
continuation high school, Trapani said. So, he said, he started his runners 
slowly, over short distances, so they would stay with the class long enough to 
see some progress. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the reason some of them are here is because they are quick to start 
and have a hard time finishing," Trapani said. "The idea is not to compete but 
to complete; I didn't want them to get frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
To encourage his students, Trapani persuaded a shoe company to donate expensive 
running shoes and a sporting goods store to give them discounts on other gear. 
An insurance company donated $4,000 to pay for uniforms, first aid kits and 
entry fees. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the students have finished three 5-kilometer runs and one 
10-kilometer race. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Herrera of Canoga Park, a 17-year-old sophomore who was kicked out of 
one high school and then quit another before enrolling at Aliso, said she plans 
to run the first six to 10 miles of the marathon before walking a little. She 
said she is planning on finishing the course. 
</P>
<P>
"All this running was new for me," said Herrera, who along with Morquecho has 
quit smoking. "Most of my friends just like to sit around." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Become Close Friends 
</P>
<P>
The students say they have become close friends after enduring many miles of 
workouts together. Along with Trapani, teachers Eric Spears and Annette Small 
have also been training with the students and plan to complete the marathon. 
The teachers do not collect extra pay for the time spent training. 
</P>
<P>
"This is part of our commitment to teaching," Trapani said. 
</P>
<P>
Jodah Jensen, a 17-year-old junior from Northridge, said he considered quitting 
about two months ago while experiencing some personal troubles. He said he was 
not getting any sympathy from the group at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that they didn't care about me," Jensen said. "But they were pushing me 
hard for a reason." 
</P>
<P>
Jensen said he has since learned that "I can endure physically and mentally. . 
. . Every mile is hard, but it's well worth it."

KOREAN BANKER SHOPPING FOR ROOM TO GROW 
</P>

<P>
The Yoon family of Rancho Palos Verdes is looking for a new house. 
</P>
<P>
Already living in a $1.5-million house in the Alta Vista section, the Yoons are 
prepared to pay up to $3 million for a larger, more luxurious home. 
</P>
<P>
Families like the Yoons, though hardly typical, are not unusual on the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula, where Pacific Rim executives are prepared to pay hundreds of 
thousands -- or millions -- in cash for a house, say realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Duk Ha Yoon, 66, an attorney and banking executive, was born in Korea and moved 
to Japan at the age of 14. 
</P>
<P>
As a young attorney in Tokyo, Yoon began investing in real estate after reading 
a book by a leading Japanese businessman. The book's investment philosophy was 
based on the maxim that land is a limited commodity and is the best investment 
for spare cash. 
</P>
<P>
After making his fortune in the banking and shipping industries, Yoon invested 
his "extra money," buying homes in Tokyo, Seoul and Kwangju, Korea. In 1986 
Yoon decided to undertake a new financial venture: founding a bank. The first 
branch of the United Citizens National Bank will open in May in Los Angeles' 
Koreatown, said Yoon, speaking in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frequent Flier 
</P>
<P>
Yoon, a resident alien, travels frequently between Tokyo and Los Angeles, so he 
decided to buy a home for himself, wife Soonrae, 60, son Jaechul, 29, 
daughter-in-law Yeonhee, 27, and 3-year-old grandson Charles Sunghyun. His son 
and daughter-in-law -- who are naturalized citizens -- will live with Yoon and 
his wife, as is the tradition in many Asian families, Yoon said. 
</P>
<P>
The peninsula was first on the family's list of neighborhoods when they moved 
here in 1986 because Yoon wanted to see his firm's freighters from his home as 
they cruised past the peninsula en route to the Port of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Yoon paid just under $1 million in cash for a four-bedroom, 4,500-square-foot 
home. The Yoons put in tennis courts and a swimming pool. The house is now 
worth about $1.6 million, Yoon said. 
</P>
<P>
When a new house was built next door, partly obstructing their ocean view, the 
Yoons decided to move. Now, Yoon said, the family wants a "more spacious" house 
on the peninsula with at least five bedrooms -- and room for more 
grandchildren. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

NEIGHBORS VOICE RESENTMENT, OIL OFFICIALS DISAPPOINTMENT OVER WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1982 Chevron USA had high hopes for the San Fernando Valley's first urban 
commercial oil well, which the oil giant had just finished digging in a 
residential section of Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors, some of whom lived as close as across the street from the drill 
site, were not as enthusiastic. They feared that the Paxton Street well would 
be a safety hazard, alter the neighborhood's character and lower their property 
values. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years after drilling started, neither Chevron officials nor area 
residents are satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron's hopes for a significant oil find have been dashed -- production 
levels at the site are a fraction of what was expected. And neighbors are upset 
with Chevron. Mostly, they resent the oil company's actions because they felt 
powerless to stop its intrusion into their neighborhood. Some still have 
nagging concerns about the danger posed by the operation and others say it 
scars the community. 
</P>
<P>
Doubly irritated are those who opposed the drilling and refused to sign oil 
lease agreements with Chevron. The company ended up taking the oil anyway and 
paid nothing for it, all of which city officials say is completely legal. 
</P>
<P>
The site yields an average of 268 barrels of oil and 5 million cubic feet of 
natural gas per day, far below the daily 2,400 barrels of oil and 24 million 
cubic feet of natural gas that Chevron officials had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very disappointing," said Margo Bart, Chevron's district supervisor 
of lands. "It's a wonderful facility and it's capable of handling far greater 
volumes than we have been able to produce." 
</P>
<P>
Looming over neighboring homes, the main oil drilling tower is on Paxton Street 
just south of the intersection of the Golden State and Simi Valley freeways. 
The drilling district holds 10 wells in a 700-acre area between Burnet Avenue 
and Whiteman Airport. Only six of the 10 wells, however, have yielded any oil, 
Bart said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the disappointing output, Chevron officials say they have paid more 
than $10 million in royalties to mineral rights owners since drilling began, 
distributing $1.3 million of that last year. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners do not necessarily hold the mineral rights to their land. The 
rights may be held by a previous owner or developer who did not sell them along 
with the land. The mineral rights entitle the holder to profits generated from 
valuable minerals, such as gold or oil, discovered underneath the property. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron refused to say how many area residents receive royalties from 
production at the Paxton Street site or to provide a breakdown of its royalty 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, however, said the city Department of Recreation and Parks, 
which owns a park in the drilling district, collects about $36,000 annually, 
and Los Angeles County officials said the county Division of Public Works, 
which has a flood control channel there, receives about $150,000 a year in 
royalties. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Transportation also owns freeways in the district, 
although representatives were unable to provide estimates of their annual 
royalty collections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quarterly Checks 
</P>
<P>
Some residents who get royalties say their checks average from $52 to $200 per 
quarter, a sum that amounts to their share of one-sixth of the value of the oil 
produced in the Paxton Street district. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Kmet is among those who are content with their checks. 
</P>
<P>
Kmet, 70, who has lived in his Pacoima house for 35 years, said it was as if 
the money was "just falling from heaven." 
</P>
<P>
But some neighbors believe that they are not receiving fair compensation for 
the oil drilling taking place against their wishes right under their back 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Savage, 71, a retired systems analyst, has lived for 30 years in a house 
virtually across the street from the drill site. He gets no royalties even 
though he owns the mineral rights to his land because he opposed Chevron's oil 
drilling plan from the beginning and refused to sign a lease. 
</P>
<P>
Savage refused to consent to the company's request to tunnel under his 
property. He believes that Chevron secretly takes oil from under his house, 
using wells drilled through neighbors' properties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Are Losing' 
</P>
<P>
"We have no guarantee that they are not drilling under our house," he said. 
"How do we know precisely how they are drilling? We are losing." 
</P>
<P>
Other residents have grumbled that Chevron is drawing oil from beneath their 
properties without their permission and without paying them. 
</P>
<P>
Bart said Chevron officials indeed presume that they are drawing oil from 
beneath every property in the drilling district. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron and city officials, however, say such practices are legal. Under city 
and state law, oil companies are allowed to draw oil from beneath a property in 
a designated drilling area if that property is smaller than an acre and if 75% 
of the other mineral rights owners in the area have already signed oil leases, 
said Jeff Druyun, senior legislative analyst for the city and former city 
petroleum administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Thus many Pacoima residents who decided not to lease their mineral rights to 
Chevron and thought that they had denied the company permission to draw oil 
from their land may actually be supplying Chevron, he said. Chevron refused to 
disclose how many residents may be in this position. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Back-Yard Wells 
</P>
<P>
Druyun said the city and state regulations were designed to ensure that oil is 
pumped efficiently in residential neighborhoods. Unlike the 1930s and '40s, 
when many people drilled oil wells in their back yards, Los Angeles residents 
are prohibited from operating their own wells, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our city rules are in the best interests of all the property owners," he said. 
</P>
<P>
City law does not ignore the needs of those who refused to sign agreements 
consenting to the drilling. The law stipulates that mineral rights holders can 
collect royalties as soon as they sign the agreement leasing their oil rights 
to a company, Druyun said. If they sign during the first five years of 
drilling, they can even collect the back royalties. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with the oil company is essentially a consent form and specifies 
the terms of drawing the oil and natural gas, and the method of calculating the 
royalties. 
</P>
<P>
Residents may be unaware of this opportunity to collect royalties, but Bart 
said she believes that the company did a fair and thorough job of educating 
property owners about their rights. "Efforts were made to re-contact people. We 
had people out there knocking on doors. But they don't get the royalty if they 
don't sign the lease." 
</P>
<P>
But Miriam Savage, Arthur Savage's wife, said no one contacted them either in 
person or by letter to tell them that they were eligible for royalties despite 
their initial refusal to consent to drilling. 
</P>
<P>
"They never came around and told us that," she said. "When they first came, we 
told them we weren't going to sign because we didn't want to be a party to the 
oil drilling. They never came back afterwards to tell us. 
</P>
<P>
"What would we have to do now to collect the royalties?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron does not profit from withholding royalties from people because any 
unclaimed money is divided and redistributed to the other mineral rights 
owners, Bart said. 
</P>
<P>
Bart said there is no question that Chevron pays the people who signed leases 
if the company takes oil from their property. However, no government agency 
monitors the oil production to ensure that mineral rights owners receive the 
full royalties to which they are entitled. 
</P>
<P>
Royalties are not the only sore point among neighbors of the Paxton Street 
drill site. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those interviewed, even those who are happy with their royalties, said 
they are concerned that the well may be unsafe. Those fears have loomed larger 
since September, 1987, when a refinery worker was killed and two others were 
injured after a spark inside an oil tank caused an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no guarantee of safety. Emergencies do happen, unforeseen mistakes, 
blunders," Savage said. "When you are in a residential neighborhood, you are 
playing with dynamite before you even begin." 
</P>
<P>
Chevron officials and experts said the neighbors' fears are unfounded. They say 
urban oil drilling accidents are rare. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing terribly unique about these urban drill sites. They are 
relatively benign," Rod Spackman, public affairs manager for Chevron, said, 
noting that the company has eight other urban drill sites throughout Los 
Angeles. The accident, he said, was "unrelated to the operations of the plant," 
which he called "one of the safest, most well-operated sites of its kind." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Heaton of the U.S. Geological Survey said: "The biggest problem is that 
something could break and cause a fire, but those residents all have natural 
gas pipes in their houses, and you have the same risk with those pipes." 
</P>
<P>
Still, neighbors are unfazed by those assurances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earthquake Fears 
</P>
<P>
Tennie White, who has lived in her home on Paxton Street for more than 20 
years, is worried that an earthquake could cause the ground to collapse because 
of the underground space left by oil drilling. Others said they fear explosions 
or fires. 
</P>
<P>
"We have heard a lot of things that have happened in other places with oil 
wells, like explosions," said Mercedes Carlon, 62, who lives across the street 
from the site. "We are senior citizens already and we can't run as fast as we 
used to." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the discontent of many neighbors and the disappointment of Chevron 
officials, the company insists that it made the right decision to drill for oil 
on Paxton Street. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a gold mine, but it is an economically productive site, and that's 
the bottom line," Spackman said. "It's a decent field."

GANG SUSPECT ARRESTED IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified School District police arrested a reputed gang member and 
were searching for two others in the drive-by shooting Thursday of a 
16-year-old boy outside a Lomita junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood police, however, said they have no suspects in an unrelated drive-by 
shooting near Inglewood High School earlier that day. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested Thursday in connection with the shooting of ninth-grader Adam Mendoza 
at Fleming Junior High School was a teen-ager who is reputed to be a member of 
the Eastside Torrance gang. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, whose name and age were not available because he is a juvenile, 
was being held at the Lomita Sheriff's Station. Police said they are looking 
for two other teen-agers who are also members of that gang. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that Mendoza was on campus at about 1:30 p.m. when he flashed 
the gang hand signs of the Harbor City Peewees at a black Camaro that was 
driving by the campus on 254th Street. Passengers in the car fired at least 
five shots at Mendoza, said Wesley Mitchell, chief of the school district's 
police force. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives said Friday, however, that Mendoza is not a gang member and did not 
display gang signs. Mendoza was to be released from Harbor-UCLA Medical Center 
this weekend, said his brother, Jose, 19. 
</P>
<P>
The older Mendoza said doctors left a bullet in Adam's neck because it would 
have been too dangerous to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials declined to comment on the teen-ager's condition. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor City Peewees and rival Eastside Torrance, which claims turf in the Los 
Angeles city and county territory near Torrance, have engaged in a violent feud 
for many years, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago today a man was shot and killed while cruising with friends near 
Normandale Recreation Center on Eastside Torrance turf. Two Harbor City gang 
members were arrested but were not charged with the shooting because of 
insufficient evidence, said officials in the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
In the Inglewood shooting, investigators said they suspect that Crip gang 
members from Los Angeles were responsible for the wounding Thursday morning of 
Joseph T. Hardges, 17, near Inglewood High School. 
</P>
<P>
Hardges and four fellow students from nearby Hillcrest High School, an 
alternative school, were walking past Inglewood High at 10:45 a.m. when three 
or four youths in a van flashed Crip gang signs and yelled gang slogans. 
</P>
<P>
One of the van's occupants then fired a single shotgun blast that hit Hardges 
in the face, neck and head. Hardges was in stable condition Friday at Martin 
Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Harold Moret said the four youths Hardges was walking with are members of 
one of the Blood gangs in Inglewood. The Bloods are traditional rivals of the 
Crips. 
</P>
<P>
Moret said police have several leads in the case, but have no suspects.

GOVERNOR SIGNS BILL TO HELP SIMI SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian has signed a bill to help Simi Valley schools finance 
classroom renovation if voters approve a March 7 ballot measure that would fund 
the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which Deukmejian signed Friday, gives the Simi Valley Unified 
School District more time to repay a 20-year-old state loan, Supt. John Duncan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), it would extend the 
repayment time of the debt from three to six years, Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
The extension would reduce property taxes paid annually by homeowners, Duncan 
said. However, it is contingent on passage of Measure A, a $35-million bond 
issue that will be submitted to voters March 7. The district is seeking passage 
of Measure A for repairs to its 27 schools, most of which are more than 25 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to understand, but, basically, if voters pass the new bond issue, 
their property taxes will drop as a result of this bill," Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, for example, the owner of a $100,000 house would pay an annual 
property tax to the district of $88 instead of $120, Duncan said.

NEW HOSPITAL PROGRAM TREATS TRAUMA VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When she was 14, Lucille began a furtive three-year affair with a family friend 
11 years her senior. Now 30, she struggles to maintain relationships and shies 
away from socializing. Three weeks ago she swallowed sleeping pills in a 
suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Recently terrified by a dream in which she wanted to kill someone, she has 
turned for help to an inpatient program for victims of traumatic experiences, 
started at Sierra Royale Hospital in Azusa this month. "I want to work the 
anger out," said Lucille, who asked that her real name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
The intensive 10- to 21-day program is open to all patients at the 57-bed 
psychiatric hospital at no extra cost. Those who are not already in the 
hospital can be admitted to the program at a cost of $600 a day, said program 
director Donna Mognett. 
</P>
<P>
About 30% of the hospital's patients have been victims of some kind of trauma, 
according to Katherine Yont, director of marketing at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Many trauma victims can be stabilized by outpatient counseling or through 
self-help groups in the community, she said. But there are others who need to 
"step away from their lives, be put into a structured program." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life Skills Training 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, 35 people had signed up for the program, which caters to victims 
recovering from experiences such as auto accidents, rape, incest and physical 
abuse. Thirty-three of the patients were already in the hospital, Yont said. 
</P>
<P>
Between group therapy sessions, participants are given training in life skills, 
including assertiveness and stress management. 
</P>
<P>
Legal issues are explored with a lawyer, and self-protection classes conducted 
as part of the program, which Mognett said offers the first formalized 
inpatient approach of its kind in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Full recovery requires intensive work, which opens emotional wounds," said 
Mognett, explaining why she felt people with such problems should stay at the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Patients identify details of the trauma they are dealing with and confront it 
by reliving the experience, an emotional release that is best dealt with under 
close supervision, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Patients are encouraged to physically vent their rage at an imagined 
perpetrator, sometimes screaming or striking out with a foam-rubber bat, 
Mognett said. They are usually exhausted or euphoric afterward, she added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Victim Needs Support 
</P>
<P>
"The victim is vulnerable, susceptible to irrational behavior, suicidal 
attempts and homicidal thoughts, and needs a supportive environment to work 
through this process," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One patient said she was more comfortable revealing her feelings because she 
felt safe living at the hospital. She was 15 when her mother killed herself, 
she said, adding that she still battles "massive" feelings of abandonment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to (undergo therapy) for an hour and then go outside and deal 
with the world," she said. Outside, "you can't cry if you feel like crying, or 
get angry in the middle of the day."

CONDOR EGGS' FERTILITY UNCLEAR IN INITIAL TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three California condor eggs laid earlier this week are now being watched by 
wildlife officials as carefully as the Soviets guard their bejeweled Faberge 
eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping that the eggs will soon boost the endangered species numbers, caretakers 
at the San Diego Wild Animal Park examined the eggs Saturday to determine 
whether the eggs are fertile, said Tom Hanscom, a park spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the first time we checked them specifically to see if they were 
fertile," Hanscom said. "We looked at all three of them, but unfortunately, the 
tests were inconclusive." 
</P>
<P>
The fertility test is conducted by placing a high-intensity lamp behind the egg 
and looking for signs of embryo development. 
</P>
<P>
"Within 4 to 10 days, if the egg is fertile, we will be able to note a dark, 
opaque spot toward one edge of the yolk," Hanscom said. "That's a sign of cell 
division . . . that an embryo is growing. We couldn't see anything today." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, an egg born to a captive pair of condors at the Los Angeles Zoo was 
moved to the Wild Animal Park in Escondido because of its expertise in handling 
condor eggs. Of the 28 California condors now in captivity, 14 were born either 
at the San Diego Zoo or the Wild Animal Park. No condors are believed to exist 
in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
Two other egg layings quickly followed. Also on Tuesday, two condors at the 
Wild Animal Park that produced a chick last March laid their second egg, and on 
Friday, a 6-year-old park condor, named Almiyi, produced an egg as well, 
Hanscom said. 
</P>
<P>
There is some concern that the eggs laid by Almiyi and the Los Angeles condors, 
also about 6 years old, will not hatch because condors normally do not reach 
sexually maturity until age 7, Hanscom said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't see any signs by the end of the 10-day mark, we'll have to say 
they're infertile. But we have every reason to believe that the other egg will 
be fertile because it came from the same pair that was successful the last 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The breeding pair, known as UN1 and AC4, produced the female chick Molloko from 
the first egg laid in captivity last March.

OFFICER WOUNDS PIPE-WIELDING NORTHRIDGE MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Northridge man was in serious condition Saturday night after he was shot by a 
Los Angeles police officer when he tried repeatedly to hit the officer with a 
pipe, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Acir Vitorio, 38, was taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center after he was 
shot in the left buttock. 
</P>
<P>
Vitorio was arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer with a deadly 
weapon, Lt. William Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began at 1:15 p.m. when Officer Jeffrey Carter arrived at an 
apartment in the 8100 block of Reseda Boulevard following a domestic violence 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Guy Lokar, 27, complained that his roommate, Vitorio, had tried to strangle 
him, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
When Carter went outside to get some paper work, Vitorio appeared and knocked 
him to the ground, police said. When the officer chased him, Vitorio 
disappeared, then returned with a pipe and hit Carter in the shoulder, they 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Carter fired two shots after Vitorio ignored his command to drop the pipe and 
tried to strike the officer again, police said.

COMMENTARY; 
</P>
<P>
A REMINDER: THE ROAD WILL MAKE A BUM OF THE BEST OF THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In scholarly tones, the sociological commentary said the incidence of 
immorality is highest among migratory workers. 
</P>
<P>
An insightful baseball writer interpreted that to mean "the road will make a 
bum of the best of them." 
</P>
<P>
The Margo Adams-Wade Boggs kiss-and-tell revelations should be played against 
that backdrop. They really aren't new, except that it's always new when the 
covers are pulled off the peccadilloes of the rich and famous. This isn't an 
important story in the sense of the sex scandals of Jimmy Swaggert and Jim 
Bakker; they were taking the money of people who believed what they said. 
</P>
<P>
Adams' statements are more than mere smarmy gossip because they tell the 
painful truth that being able to hit .355 doesn't in itself make a man a swell 
person. Too bad the public doesn't want to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
Let's make one thing perfectly clear, as the expression goes: Not all athletes 
are guilty of the charges Adams makes against Boggs -- many of which Boggs has 
admitted. There are plenty of faithful husbands and decent people in sports. 
But don't be outraged at the published statement that not all of them play in 
the image of the Wheaties box; some of them are more suited for Penthouse, 
where the first installment of Adams' tales appear in the April issue. 
</P>
<P>
Don't spend a whole lot of sympathy on Margo Adams' self-illustrated plight. 
She knew what she was getting into; she was as much the hunter as the hunted. 
She pointed at Boggs and told an acquaintance: "Bring him." She was exploiting 
Boggs as much as he was exploiting her. 
</P>
<P>
If Adams had succeeded in taking Boggs away from his wife, would she have had 
any right to think some other woman wouldn't have done as much to her? Of 
course, they all think it will be different for them. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the line from Bjorn Borg's T-shirt: "Never love a tennis player; to 
him love means nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Boggs made his own bed. 
</P>
<P>
All professional athletes are inundated with available sex. All of them. There 
are women who feel a magnetic pull from athletes or rock stars or entertainers 
or politicians. They are commonly known as groupies. The first groupie probably 
waited at the athlete's gate at the Colosseum in Rome or passed him a note near 
the lion pen. There are all kinds of variations on the groupie. There are the 
Deadheads -- male and female -- who go to the ends of the earth for Grateful 
Dead concerts; there are groups of adults who structure their lives around 
travel with the Yankees. Sex has little or nothing to do with it for them; they 
are drawn to the aura of the stars. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the real groupies. Once upon a time they were known as 
bimbos or Baseball Annies. And they were there before the big money. Some take 
their devotion to the extreme. In 1949 the first baseman for the Phillies, 
Eddie Waitkus, was shot by Ruth Ann Steinhagen, who thought she loved him so 
much that if she couldn't have him, nobody would. 
</P>
<P>
She had never met Waitkus but had made a shrine to him beginning when he played 
for the Cubs. When he came back to town as a visiting player, she checked into 
the Phillies' hotel. She left a note inviting him to her room. 
</P>
<P>
And he went. And she shot him. 
</P>
<P>
When he was recovering in a hospital, Waitkus asked: "Why did that silly honey 
do that?" 
</P>
<P>
Of course he went to her room as males have since Adam in the Garden. Waitkus 
was a bachelor. To many, a ring does not cut circulation. Athletes learn from 
the beginning that the world exists to please them. 
</P>
<P>
There is the basic bit of advice given to the athlete's wife: Don't surprise 
your husband on the road; you may be the one surprised. Ballplayers go out for 
food and drink and relaxation after a ballgame. They usually go where people 
their age go. Where ballplayers go, unattached women go. Both sides know where 
the meat markets are. Helen of Troy understoodas much. 
</P>
<P>
For some of them the circumstance is no different from any singles 
bar-recreation center where boy meets girl. Obviously, for others it's 
something else. Adams notes that "many of those self-proclaimed 'Christian' 
players" were not above doing drugs or having extra-marital affairs. Thursday's 
revelation was that Steve Garvey, who was married Saturday, made two other 
women pregnant during the time after his divorce from his first wife. Garvey -- 
image as cleanest of the clean -- promised to assume responsibility. "I'll live 
up to my moral obligations, which I feel strongly about because I'm a 
Christian," Garvey said. Nobody expected him to be celibate. And being 
responsible is admirable, but he should have known something about planned 
parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
That's not quite the same as the Adams-Boggs affair. The one to feel sorry for 
is Debbie Boggs, his wife and mother of his children. With all of the mounting 
evidence, she bought her husband's claims that they were "only one-night 
stands." It's the constant terror of the athlete's wife who understands even a 
little bit. She has either complete trust, or denial. 
</P>
<P>
She has heard the denial of the athlete whose wife saw him with another woman: 
"Are you going to believe me or your lying eyes?"

WADE BOGGS PUTS UP A FRONT, SAYS THAT HE CAN WITHSTAND STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SMITH, Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WINTER HAVEN, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wade Boggs wants to remain with the Boston Red Sox for the rest of his career. 
He would love to keep hitting .350 and spend this spring thinking about how 
such a performance would lead to a new lucrative contract. 
</P>
<P>
"But that (a new contract) is the least of my worries right now," Boggs said 
last week, somewhat wistfully. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Boggs is entering the final year of a three-year contract, he 
cannot afford to dream such dreams, because of Margo Adams. 
</P>
<P>
Adams is the woman with whom Boggs carried on a four-year affair. She is 
pursuing a civil suit seeking damages because of their breakup, alleging 
emotional distress and breach of oral contract by the third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
The suit is the easy part. All Boggs has to lose there is money. Come today, he 
will know whether or not he has lost the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
This is the day Penthouse magazine will release advance copies of a tell-all 
article by Adams, rumored not only to further scandalize Boggs, but also more 
than one of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, Boggs began what will be a public wait. He arrived at a 
spring-training complex in a town whose very name suggests relief and comfort. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs, however, will find no such haven until he and his teammates read the 
words and start to assess the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Boggs' public posture is "What me worry"? He moved among some of his 
teammates who reportedly stand in line to be the most maligned. He did so in a 
relaxed fashion that suggested that his biggest concern is getting ready for 
baseball, not mudslinging with Adams or mud-wrestling with teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Is he worried about what today will bring? 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all," Boggs said. 
</P>
<P>
Is he concerned about management, which all winter has been rumored to be 
trying to trade off the 1988 batting champion and .350-plus lifetime hitter? 
</P>
<P>
"You'll have to ask Mr. Gorman," Boggs said of Red Sox General Manager Lou 
Gorman. He could speak only for himself, said Boggs, and his sentiments 
couldn't be clearer. "I want to continue to play my career here for the next 10 
years," he said. "When I'm 40, I'll retire. Being in a Red Sox uniform is the 
most important thing." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he was asked, can Wade Boggs still be Wade Boggs, no matter what 
uniform he wears? 
</P>
<P>
Granted, he has an incredibly strong personality trait that enables him to lock 
in on baseball in spite of off-field hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
His mother died in a car crash and, after one of the worst months of his 
career, he carried on, and won another batting title. 
</P>
<P>
Adams has hammered away for a half year and he refuses any sort of compromise 
that would get the scandal out of the headlines and buy him and his family some 
respite. But this is different. This is in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Can he remain that uncanny, unflappable ballplayer through one more crisis? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Boggs said. 
</P>
<P>
And to illustrate that confidence he pointed to his .325 average he had in June 
when Adams struck for the first time publicly, then the .391 pace he maintained 
from that point on. "It's concentration," he said. "I cross the white line and 
I forget about it." 
</P>
<P>
That's an argument that will be easy to accept -- if the clubhouse remains 
friendly. And Boggs -- give him credit -- insists that it will. 
</P>
<P>
He has talked to the co-author of the article, David Shumacher, and, said 
Boggs, "He's told me nearly everything that's in there. I've heard a majority 
of the stories. There's hardly anything in there. You guys are going to be very 
disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Still, until the written words are actually seen, the proportion of scandal is 
still unpredictable. And what must not be overlooked is the difference between 
Boggs' public and private stances. 
</P>
<P>
He has worked awfully hard to put out fires, even though he says that they will 
never be lighted. 
</P>
<P>
He has talked to Jim Rice -- who reputedly was the subject of some racist 
comments Adams alleges Boggs made. 
</P>
<P>
He has talked to Bob Stanley -- who reportedly was photographed with an 
unidentified woman in a hotel room in 1986 by Boggs and former Red Sox pitcher 
Steve Crawford, something Boggs has termed an innocent set-up joke that got out 
of hand. 
</P>
<P>
Who else has he talked to and pacified? Boggs would neither disclose the 
contents of those private conferences nor say if it was necessary to speak with 
any other Red Sox players, or major leaguers, for that matter. All he would say 
is that he's finished with such sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything that needs to be said has been said," Boggs said. "I've spoken with 
everybody that's involved. Everything's fine. Everything that needs to be said 
is said. All the meetings and all the apologies are done. 
</P>
<P>
"If I did (keep meeting with teammates) every time she said something new, I'd 
have to hold meetings every day of the season. I can't help what she does. If I 
could, none of this stuff would come out." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Boggs' diplomacy is working. Monday, both Stanley and Rice publicly 
were models of decorum, content not to drop their gloves and pummel him. (What 
happened behind closed doors in the clubhouse during workouts, only they know.) 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Boggs, he cannot guarantee the placid atmosphere will remain 
because he cannot assure even himself that he knows everything Adams will 
interpret or tell. Adams has shown a great propensity for discarding her own 
reputation in order to drill him. Her thirst for dredging up even more 
scandalous material seems as unquenchable as the thirst Boggs says he once had 
for extramarital sex. 
</P>
<P>
So Boggs waits. The brave front is in place, the only sweat thus far caused by 
his first workout. He has to trust that the article is as tame as reported. He 
has to hope that Penthouse seriously overpaid when it gave Adams a reported 
$100,000. And he has to pray that Stanley, Rice and others with whom he must 
coexist remain sanguine.

DOUGLAS IS POISED TO BREAK ASSIST RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AP 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SYRACUSE, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sherman Douglas has never needed a holiday to practice his stylized version of 
the philosophy that it's better to give than receive. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's why the Syracuse senior point guard is about to set college 
basketball's all-time assist record. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be a point guard and be selfish. It just doesn't go," said Douglas, 
who has 872 assists, 22 shy of the NCAA record of 894 set by Northeastern's 
Andre LaFleur, who played between 1983 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing you can do at the point is be selfish. Your team would never 
win," said the 22-year-old Washington, D.C., native, who is nicknamed the 
"General." 
</P>
<P>
Winning is the essence of playing for Douglas, who has spent his career passing 
out glory to other players so his team could prosper. 
</P>
<P>
With his steady career at Syracuse coming to an end, some of that glory is 
finding its way back to Douglas, who also will likely set the school record for 
steals and pass NBA Hall-of-Famer Dave Bing as the most prolific scorer in 
Syracuse history. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had an amazing career," said Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim. 
</P>
<P>
The only player ever to leave a deeper mark on the Syracuse program, according 
to the coach, was Bing, who played in the same backcourt with Boeheim. 
</P>
<P>
"Bing was a one-of-a-kind player because he could do so much. Sherman's like 
that, too. He plays both ends of the court. He's inside and he's outside. He's 
the greatest passer I've ever seen," said Boeheim. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious, that when the General is out there, he makes them a great team," 
said St. John's Coach Lou Carnesecca, who admits to being a Douglas fan as long 
as the Redmen are on a different court. "He's quite a player." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas is currently third in the nation, averaging nine assists a game. He is 
the Orangemen's leading scorer with an 18.2 point-per-game average. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this season against Providence, Douglas tied the NCAA single-game 
record with 22 assists. He has recorded 10 or more assists in 11 games this 
season with an assortment of conventional passes, alley-oop lobs and 
electrifying manuevers. 
</P>
<P>
The pre-season selection as the Big East's Player of the Year, Douglas is 
considered to be one of the top three point guards in the nation, along with 
Oklahoma's Mookie Blaylock and Iowa's B.J. Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
But Douglas has risen from humble beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
"I had self-doubts coming out of high school," said Douglas, who was virtually 
ignored by the hometown Hoyas of nearby Georgetown and most other Division I 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I had confidence I would make a good point guard but after not being recruited 
I began thinking that maybe I wasn't as good a player as I thought," said 
Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
John Woods, who coached Douglas at Springarn High School, remembered being 
puzzled by the lack of interest in his star guard. 
</P>
<P>
"He had an awkward shot, but somehow he always found a way to get the job 
done," said Woods, whose team was 31-0 Douglas' senior year. "He would always 
rise to the occasion. He had a competitive spirit that made me think there was 
nothing he couldn't accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse was one of a handful of colleges that expressed interest in Douglas. 
His decision to become an Orangeman wasn't an easy one because it meant playing 
-- or rather sitting -- behind Dwayne (Pearl) Washington for two seasons before 
even getting a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, who had been the shooting guard at Springarn although recruited as a 
point guard, spent his first year learning from Washington and developing his 
ball-handling skills. 
</P>
<P>
When Washington decided to turn professional after his junior season, Douglas 
became the Orangemen's leader. 
</P>
<P>
"He's developed the ability to run this club and make good decisions," said 
Boeheim. "And he's still scores at the point. His improvement is the reason 
this has been a winning team." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Syracuse, 22-5, lost both games Douglas missed following a back injury 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not the same team without him," said Boeheim. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe in him as a leader. It's his competitiveness that gets us going," 
said teammate Derrick Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
For the 6-foot Douglas, the biggest thrill in the game of basketball is 
delivering a crisp, precise pass to its target. 
</P>
<P>
"Being the all-time passing leader of college basketball is going to be my 
biggest thrill because passing and distributing the ball is what I want to be 
known for," said Douglas. "That means I've achieved my goal of being the best 
passer I could be." 
</P>
<P>
It's often said of Douglas that he forces his teammates to score because his 
on-target passing is usually to their shooting hand, which helps create 
shooting opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"Sherman knows where the scoring opportunities come and he gets the ball to 
guys where they can do something with it. Making a good pass is only part of an 
assist," said Boeheim. 
</P>
<P>
While Douglas has made his name synonymous with assists, he also has become 
closely identified with the alley-oop pass he throws to near perfection. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I started doing in high school when I realized there was no way 
they could stop the other guy once he caught the ball," said Douglas, who had 
among his high school receivers, former Georgetown star Michael Graham. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't throw it much here until my sophomore season after I was established. 
Now, I've got all these guys who can get up," said Douglas, referring to 
Coleman, and leapers Stephen Thompson and David Johnson, "so why shouldn't I 
throw it?" 
</P>
<P>
Suprisingly, Douglas and his teammates never practice the alley-oop. It's a 
spontaneous connection on court that usually starts off with a glance between 
Douglas and his target. The teammate breaks behind the defense and Douglas 
heaves the ball at a spot above the basket. 
</P>
<P>
According to Douglas, it wouldn't do any good to practice the play. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of passing is skill, but a lot of it is having a natural ability, a sense 
of timing."

GATHERS AND FRYER LEAD LOYOLA PAST SANTA CLARA 
</P>

SANTA CLARA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Toso Pavilion is normally tough on visiting teams, but Loyola Marymount 
continued a two-year roll here Friday night with a 112-101 victory over the 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
Before a vocal, standing-room crowd of about 5,000, the Lions got 32 points 
apiece from Hank Gathers and Jeff Fryer and forced 22 Santa Clara turnovers to 
improve to 17-9 overall and 10-3 in the West Coast Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola victory, coupled with Pepperdine's loss at USF, pulled the Lions 
into a second-place tie with the Waves, a game behind St. Mary's, going into 
tonight's regular-season finale at USF. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped Santa Clara into fifth place at 6-7 (17-9 overall), a game 
behind USF. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara is 26-5 on its homecourt over the last two seasons, with three of 
the losses being to Loyola. Counting last year's WCAC tournament, Loyola has 
won five straight games at Toso. 
</P>
<P>
Fryer was responsible for much of Loyola's early success, hitting five 
three-pointers in the first half, and also made two three-pointers down the 
stretch to thwart Santa Clara. He finished with seven of the Lions' 10 
three-pointers, while the Broncos hit only two. 
</P>
<P>
Fryer also contributed four key rebounds. Gathers led both teams with 15. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a terrific effort from Jeff Fryer on the boards," Loyola Coach Paul 
Westhead said. 
</P>
<P>
"Fryer was the difference in not letting them come back. His shooting was 
uncanny. A couple times, most of the people and a couple players didn't know 
the ball was inbounds, and he was shooting the three-pointer." 
</P>
<P>
In a sometimes sloppy first half, there were 25 turnovers -- 15 by Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola pulled ahead for the first time at 15-14 on a Fryer three-pointer, one 
of seven the Lions hit before halftime in building a 53-44 lead. Loyola led by 
as many as 15 points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, held in check for much of the half, had 10 points in the final 6:39 
before halftime to pace a 16-8 run. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos ate away at the lead quickly in the second half, pulling within 
71-66 as Mitch Burley hit their first three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
But Loyola answered with a 15-0 run, all but two of the points being scored by 
Fryer and Gathers, and Loyola pulled away to a 86-66 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara made a final late charge, getting within 102-94 with two minutes 
left, but Enoch Simmons rebuilt the lead to 10 by following in his own miss, 
and Gathers added six more points before the buzzer as Loyola coasted, despite 
a total of 20 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
The teams' combined 213 points set a Toso Pavilion record. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Jens Gordon led Santa Clara with 28 points, making 13 of 16 shots, and 
13 rebounds before fouling out. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead said: "Anytime you can win on the road, it's a good win. We put good 
pressure on with our defense. The defense created the turnovers." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara Coach Carroll Williams said: "We just had too many turnovers. We 
didn't want to take a quick shot; that was our game plan. We were too frantic 
and out of control in the first half, and 15 turnovers (in the first half) 
doesn't get it done."

SUN BELT CONFERENCE WANTS INSTANT REPLAY ON LAST-SECOND SHOTS 
</P>

<P>
The Sun Belt Conference will ask the NCAA men's basketball rules committee to 
approve the use of instant replay on half- and game-ending shots only, 
beginning next season, according to Commissioner Vic Bubas. 
</P>
<P>
He said that if the committee will not implement use of replay as a national 
rules change, he hopes his conference will be allowed to use it on an 
experimental basis. With the rules committee being chaired by Gene Bartow, 
coach at Sun Belt member Alabama-Birmingham, Bubas may get his wish. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's got merit, and I'm sure the rules committee will discuss it very 
carefully in Seattle," Bartow said last week, referring to the rules 
committee's meeting following the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be my opinion that it should be looked at very carefully and probably 
put in. But I have only one vote." 
</P>
<P>
Bubas' desire for replay arose out of what became a double-overtime loss for 
Western Kentucky after it clearly had defeated Jacksonville on a tip-in at the 
end of the first overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"I happened to be watching the game on television," Bubas said, "and the camera 
work was real good. The picture included the clock and the red light (mounted 
on the basket support and activated when time expires). 
</P>
<P>
It was a tough call at full speed, but the replay clearly showed the game 
should have been over (i.e., the tie-breaking Western Kentucky goal should have 
been allowed)." 
</P>
<P>
Bubas said he understood the arguments of people who say that limited use of 
instant replay would put college basketball on the road to extensive use of 
instant replay, but he added, "I think this is so clear, I would be willing to 
never go beyond this if they let us do it." 
</P>
<P>
Bubas headed off other potential problems, such as a game not being televised 
or a picture not including the clock, the shot and the red light, by proposing 
that under these circumstances, the use of replay would be prohibited -- just 
as it is now. 
</P>
<P>
They may not be household names unless you live in the house of a coach or 
scout, but guards Gary Payton of Oregon State, Steve Henson of Kansas State, 
forwards Jeff Martin of Murray State and Randy White of Louisiana Tech and 
center Luc Longley of New Mexico would form a starting lineup most teams 
wouldn't mind having. 
</P>
<P>
Payton, a 6-foot-3 junior, averages 19 points, 8.5 assists, 4.4 rebounds, 3.4 
steals and 38 minutes per game. He recently had a 159-minute stretch during 
which he committed one turnover. Los Angeles Lakers scout Ronnie Lester calls 
him "one of the best players in his class." 
</P>
<P>
Henson, a 6-1 junior, averages 17 points, five assists and 36 minutes. He is 
shooting 94 percent from the free throw line. Said one NBA scout: "He could be 
the next John Stockton." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, a 6-7 senior swingman, averages 25 points per game and is making around 
50 percent of his three-point field goal tries. "I don't know if there's a 
better outside shooter in this year's draft," said Orlando Magic scout John 
Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
White, a 6-8, 240-pound senior who will be a forward in the NBA, averages 20 
points and 10 rebounds while shooting nearly 60 percent from the field. He has 
exceeded the career scoring and rebounding totals of another Louisiana Tech 
player -- Karl (The Mailman) Malone. White will be "a high first-round pick," 
one NBA scout said. 
</P>
<P>
Longley is a 7-2 sophomore from Australia whose statistics are relatively 
modest now (about 11 points, seven rebounds, two blocked shots per game). But 
Gabriel said, "He is as far along if not further than Rik Smits was at the same 
time in his career." 
</P>
<P>
Other lesser-knowns worth keeping in mind: 
</P>
<P>
South Alabama senior guard Jeff Hodge, Wisconsin senior guard Trent Jackson, 
Air Force junior guard Ray Dudley, Mississippi junior forward Gerald "World 
Class" Glass, East Carolina senior swingman Blue Edwards and Clemson 6-10 
junior center Elden Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
One of the nation's more unheralded coaches, Princeton's Pete Carril, keeps 
rolling along. 
</P>
<P>
Now in his 22nd season at the school, he recently coached his 600th career game 
and once again has the Tigers (16-5 overall, 8-1 and first in the Ivy League) 
in position for an automatic NCAA tournament bid. 
</P>
<P>
Winning its sixth in a row last Saturday night, Princeton defeated Brown, 
57-33. No Brown player scored more than four points. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State forward Treg Lee is named for his father's four best friends: Tony, 
Ronnie, Eddie and Greg. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to Thursday night's games, Arizona was at 20-3, Stanford at 20-5, Oregon 
State at 18-5, California at 17-9 and UCLA at 16-7. The Pacific-10 Conference 
could end up with five 20-win teams for the first time since 1938-39. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket scalping is illegal in Seattle, site of the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
But it is legal across Lake Washington in Bellevue, Wash., and Tore Kragerud, 
manager of That's The Ticket in Bellevue, was reported to say that within two 
weeks premium tickets would go for between $1,200 and $1,500 each. 
</P>
<P>
Rashard Griffith, a 6-10 eighth-grader in Chicago, already has received 
recruiting questionnaires from more than 50 colleges.

HOPSON, MORRIS BRING NETS STABILITY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The New Jersey Nets, a longshot for the playoffs this season, can find solace 
in the knowledge that they might have found a frontcourt-backcourt duo that 
could take them to post-season play for a long time in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Dennis Hopson, the third pick in the 1987 draft, and forward Chris 
Morris, the No. 4 pick last year, started slowly after moving into the starting 
lineup together on Jan. 11. Going into New Jersey's game at Seattle on Jan. 31, 
Morris was shooting 44.7% from the field and averaging 9.8 points, while Hopson 
had a 9.4 average on 42.8% shooting. 
</P>
<P>
But since Jan. 31, when Hopson scored 32 points and Morris 21 as the Nets ended 
Seattle's homecourt winning streak at 17 with a 118-112 victory, the pair has 
been on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
Including that game and the next 11, Hopson hit 45.3% of his shots and averaged 
21.1 points, while Morris connected on 46.6% of his field goals and averaged 
19.8. 
</P>
<P>
"Dennis and Chris are doing good things for us," Net Coach Willis Reed said. 
"But once they get this season behind them and then come back with a full 
training camp, they will be even better." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said he was hesitant about putting Morris and Hopson in the starting 
lineup together. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want them to be on a roller coaster," he said. "I think the worst 
thing I could do was to start them and then have to back away from that 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
There were plenty of hard feelings on both sides by the time Dallas traded Mark 
Aguirre to Detroit, but he left quite a legacy as the No. 1 pick in the 1981 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
He is the Mavericks' all-time leading scorer with 13,930 points and all-time 
leading rebounder with 3,244. He also is the club leader in field goals, field 
goals attempted, 3-pointers, 3-point attempts, free throws, free throws 
attempted and games started, and has the team record for points in a game, 49, 
and season, 2,330. 
</P>
<P>
But his former teammate weren't sorry to see Aguirre go. From their point of 
view, Aguirre was both the best and worst of the Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're working with somebody and they don't want to be with you, you 
wouldn't want to be with them either," Derek Harper said. "Mark is not here 
anymore and I don't think anybody is going to lose any sleep over it." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel 40 pounds lighter," Sam Perkins added. "A load has been dumped." 
</P>
<P>
"This move is going to boost the morale of the team and make us a happier team, 
no doubt about it," Rolando Blackman added. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte's 5-foot-3 guard, Muggsy Bogues, wasn't always a basketball star. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what other sports he played as a youth in Baltimore, Bogues said he won a 
state wrestling championship as a 65-pound 13-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he concentrated on basketball, following in the footsteps of his older 
sister Sheron, who won a scholarship to Towson State even though she was only 
5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland coach Lenny Wilkens has an answer for anyone who doubts the Cavaliers 
can win with low-scoring small forward Mike Sanders in the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was at Seattle and we won the title, Lonnie Shelton was our small 
forward and he was no big scorer," Wilkens said. "Portland won an NBA title 
with Bobby Gross not scoring much at small forward. What I'm saying is a lack 
of scoring in one area can be compensated for in other areas, and that's what 
we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Shelton averaged 13.5 for NBA champion Seattle with Wilkens as coach in 1979. 
Gross averaged 11.4 for the Trail Blazers when they won a title in 1977.

AGING SUPER DIAMOND STILL SUPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Super Diamond is a walking catalogue of equine ailments. 
</P>
<P>
His physical problems are so chronic that he is able to race only three or four 
times in a year. Trainer Eddie Gregson knows that any race could turn out to be 
the gelding's last. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite all his woes, Super Diamond accomplished an amazing, improbable 
feat at Santa Anita last weekend. He was entered against the best stakes horses 
in the West in the San Antonio Handicap and he beat them all -- at the age of 
9. 
</P>
<P>
Super Diamond and John Henry are the only thoroughbreds ever to win a Grade I 
race at such an advanced age. Even great old geldings like Kelso, Forego and 
Exterminator never reached such a geriatric milestone. 
</P>
<P>
If ever a horse looked unlikely to have a long, productive career in high-class 
company it was Super Diamond. The people who bred him, Roland and Ramona Sahm, 
owned one cheap mare, and knew nothing about the thoroughbred business. Super 
Diamond was born on a hillside and was raised on terrain more suitable to a 
goat than a prospective racehorse. His conformation was terrible. 
</P>
<P>
This was hardly the sort of horse that Gregson -- one of California's ablest 
horsemen -- would have sought out to train. But he and the Sahms had mutual 
friends, and he went to look at the horse when he was a yearling. "His ankles 
were very rough even then," Gregson recalled, "and when I reached down to touch 
them, the horse struck me on the head. I told the owners, 'I don't think I'd 
want to train this horse unless you geld him.' " 
</P>
<P>
Super Diamond was subjected to this common remedy for untractable behavior, and 
he showed immediate promise when he went into training. But his ankle problems 
wouldn't go away. 
</P>
<P>
"He won his first two starts and looked like a real Derby prospect," Gregson 
said, but Super Diamond got a swollen, infected ankle and he was out of action. 
</P>
<P>
A year later -- early in his 4-year-old season -- he stumbled badly out of the 
race and had to have a sizable chip taken out of his ankle. Early in his 
5-year-old season he had a training injury and his ankle was down for the count 
again. 
</P>
<P>
When he was 6, Super Diamond did what ailing athletes (both human and equine) 
are apt to do; having favored his left ankle for so long, he started developing 
problems in his right knee. Even so, Gregson was able to get him sounder and 
fitter than at any time in his life, and Super Diamond reeled off four straight 
victories in stakes -- including the prestigious Hollywood Gold Cup -- in the 
latter half of the year. He won stakes at the ages of 7 and 8, too, but Gregson 
finally thought he was losing the battle against Super Diamond's maladies. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year he came out of a race with some tearing in the tendon on the right 
knee," Gregson said. "You can imagine the chances of a horse his age 
(recovering). I told the owners to consider the horse retired, though we'd go 
through the motions to see if he could come back. In mid-summer last year, the 
vet looked at him and told me, 'You're not going to believe this, but he might 
be able to come back.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gregson put Super Diamond back into training -- and never babied him. To be 
ready for high-class stakes competition, Gregson knew, the gelding would have 
to be perfectly fit. There couldn't be any compromise. Despite his ailments, 
the gelding cooperated, and did what was necessary. "He likes his life and he 
loves the attention he gets," Gregson said. "He has to rest in his stall a lot, 
but he's a courageous horse. I've never seen one like him." 
</P>
<P>
And the racing world rarely has seen one with a record like Super Diamond. When 
he won the San Antonio, the victory was his 16th in 36 career starts and 
boosted his career earnings to $1.4 million. It also marked the 14th straight 
time he has finished fourth or better; the last time he raced without earning a 
paycheck was in April 1986. It would be rare for a physically perfect horse to 
run so consistently, and it is hard to imagine how an infirm one can do it. "He 
is," Gregson said, "a freak of nature."

MASSENBURG IS A REAL SUCCESS STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
These have been three upside-down years for Maryland's Tony Massenburg. 
</P>
<P>
Since joining the Terrapin basketball program, he suffered through the 
hurricane of innuendo that followed the death of Len Bias. Then he was forced 
to sit out his sophomore year on academic suspension, a sojourn that was 
extended through the first semester last year so he could get his grades up to 
the satisfaction of Coach Bob Wade. 
</P>
<P>
Even after Maryland's successful season last year, his dreams of playing for a 
Top 10 school were dashed among the debris following the exit of six Maryland 
players through transfer, academic ineligibility, red-shirting and suspension. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't been quiet," Massenburg said. "I think my freshman year was probably 
the quietest in terms of things going on." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, here he is, after three years of turmoil, the Terrapins' leading scorer 
who has also been honored for making the Athletic Director's Honor Roll, which 
salutes student-athletes with a grade-point average of 3.0 or better. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony has done a remarkable job," Wade said. "When I came here he was on 
academic suspension. He's worked hard in the classroom and he's done an 
excellent job trying to perfect himself as a basketball player. . . . He 
could've given up a long time ago but he hung in there and he's gotten his 
priorities in order." 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't been easy for this 6-foot-9 junior from Sussex, Va. 
</P>
<P>
"After the death of my teammate (Len Bias) things sort of got turned upside 
down," Massenburg said. "I was right in the middle of it and I did a lot of 
suffering because of the things that were going on and the probing that was 
taking place." 
</P>
<P>
Massenburg said he found himself accused of being on drugs, selling drugs, and 
of being a college dropout when he was forced to red-shirt the 1986-87 season 
after academic difficulties left him on academic suspension. He declined to 
discuss the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of people saying, 'He'll never play for Maryland again. He's 
washed up. He'll never playing any more,"' Massenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had some terrible things said about me the year I didn't play. I went back 
home and some rumors got spread around that I was selling drugs and that I had 
flunked out of school. . . . I was still very much in school and very much into 
basketball. I just wasn't playing on the team that year." 
</P>
<P>
So, while the Terps were struggling through a season that saw them go winless 
in 14 Atlantic Coast Conference games, Massenburg was helpless. 
</P>
<P>
"Between my freshman year and my sophomore year I really improved a lot," he 
said. "I could see where I could help the team. Sitting down really hurt." 
</P>
<P>
It's a hurt that Massenburg has turned into something positive. 
</P>
<P>
"The first year I sat out really did me a lot of good," Massenburg said. "I 
didn't want to. I was forced to. But, in reality, it really helped me. . . . I 
learned a lot. I grew up a lot as a person. If I hadn't already learned how to 
face adversity, I learned how to face it then. I sort of found myself." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of that progress, Wade forced Massenburg to sit out the first seven 
games of last season to concentrate on his studies. When he finally did get 
back into a Terrapin uniform, it was an auspicious return. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty pounds heavier and stronger from working with weights, Massenburg 
dominated inside, scoring 25 points and leading Maryland to an 82-77 victory 
over South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"That was like a dream," Massenburg said of that game. "I had worked in the gym 
a lot by myself and prayed that I would come back and make an impact and do the 
things I was capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
Massenburg wound averaging 10.1 points for the Terps, who finished 18-13 and 
advanced to the second round of the NCAA post-season tournament with lineup 
sporting only two seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year had me thinking, 'It's finally over. We're finally going to get on 
track. We're going to win. We're going to present a positive image on the 
University of Maryland once again,' " Massenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't to be. Freshman sensation Brian Williams transferred to Arizona. Two 
other players also transferred. Guard Rudy Archer was ruled academically 
ineligible, guard Teyon McCoy decided to red-shirt this season, and Rodney 
Walker was suspended from the team. 
</P>
<P>
The Terps went the entire month of January without a win, losing nine games, 
seven in the ACC. 
</P>
<P>
Massenburg's four years at Maryland have robbed him of any naivete that goes 
with youth. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way I'm glad it happened to me because it gave me a feel for what the 
real world is like real early," Massenburg said. "There were some points where 
I didn't think anybody was on our side, that Maryland was this black cloud over 
college basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Massenburg has stuck it out. "I would just like to be remembered as 
a guy who took some hard knocks at the University of Maryland and made the best 
of it."

IS THE SUGAR RAY LEONARD-THOMAS HEARNS FIGHT REALLY A WAR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY KORNHEISER, Washington Post

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under attack as brutal and vulturous, the timeless sport of boxing, as Bill 
Brubaker's comprehensive articles illustrated, is on the defensive. Its base of 
support is shrinking. Even its most dedicated loyalists recognize this. 
Conceding the need to expand boxing's audience, promoter Bob Arum trumpeted his 
intention "to introduce our sport to the elegant lady in Dubuque, Iowa." 
</P>
<P>
To that end Arum has come up with an interesting marketing strategy: He has 
billed the Ray Leonard-Thomas Hearns fight as "The War." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Arum has inside information we don't. Maybe elegant ladies in Dubuque 
carry AK-47s under their skirts, and their idea of fun is to pop somebody in 
the chops with a two-by-four. Like Washington sportscaster Glenn Brenner, I 
think it may have been wiser to promote the fight as "An Evening With Laura 
Ashley." But what do we know? Arum went to Harvard Law School. We didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Arum cooked up the concept, then left the execution to Washington's 
sports PR man extraordinaire, Charlie Brotman. After serenading the press with 
enough military marches to drive John Philip Sousa screaming from the room, 
Brotman came on stage wearing an ersatz military uniform ("He must've borrowed 
it from the valet," said Leonard's attorney, Mike Trainer, "I guarantee you he 
doesn't have to have it back in an hour") and a silver helmet that looked like 
a soup tureen on his head. A District of Columbia National Guard team presented 
the colors, and Brotman intoned, "Welcome to the war zone. It's official. It is 
a war." To underline the motif, Brotman welcomed a man "who is no stranger to 
war -- that's exactly why we invited him," and introduced former Marine Corps 
commandant, Gen. P.X. Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
Here's where it crossed the line from tacky-but-tolerable. Here's Kelly, a man 
who sent soldiers into real war, stared into its real horror, and he's barking 
on, "Let me promise you the Strategic Air Command's on full alert. The Marine 
Corps is ready to conduct a massive amphibious assault. When we say war, we 
really mean war ... Make no mistake, this is war. Draw your helmets and flak 
jackets. You want war? We'll give you war." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Kelly would laugh and say, "Oh no, this isn't real war. This is just a 
promotional gimmick." (The U.S. Senators from Nevada, Harry Reid and Richard 
Bryan, who stood to "ratify and confirm this war" at Arum's request, would say 
the same thing: that it was strictly promotional, a gimmick, an economic boon 
to Nevada.) But winking off camera doesn't mitigate your performance on camera. 
All the elegant ladies in Dubuque see when they watch the tape of that press 
conference is the confusing sight of a former Marine Corps commandant and two 
U.S. Senators pretending boxing is war. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing has used the metaphor of war before; the Gerry Cooney-Michael Spinks 
"War At The Shore," for example. But it was never stretched out as tastelessly 
or shamefully as this. Boxing isn't war. By participating in this dog and pony 
show, Kelly, however well-intentioned, trivialized his soldierly profession; 
Bryan and Reid, who may be accustomed to such excessiveness in Las Vegas, 
appeared foolish, carrying a bad joke too far. 
</P>
<P>
Arum's approach to Leonard-Hearns II has turned a new corner in boxing 
promotion-onto wrestling's side of the street. Wrestling hawks itself as global 
morality plays, wraps itself in glitter and exaggeration, and tweaks the funny 
bone. In court cases, though, wrestling admits it's merely a show, following a 
script. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing is entertainment; all sport is. But at its core boxing is an honest, 
elemental competition between men. Boxing has honor. Wrestling has fake blood, 
Halloween masks and tearaway T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
It was insulting to Leonard and Hearns to have them solemnly march on stage 
carrying helmets and theatrically stare at each other. (First of all, Leonard 
wasn't dressed like a soldier. He was wearing an atomic plum sportsjacket that 
made him look like part of the trombone section at a Carribbean bar-mitzvah. 
Second of all, it was difficult for him to keep from laughing.) We've learned 
to expect hype at fight promotions, but these are men of character, history and 
substance. They deserve more noble treatment. 
</P>
<P>
You can make fun of this fight. Heaven knows, I have. Hearns has been put on 
his fanny two fights in a row now, which makes him "The Sit Man," not "The Hit 
Man." Knowing that he dare not get into the ring with anyone young, fast or 
talented, Leonard has picked Hearns for the first bout in his Grand Masters of 
Boxing Series (which will undoubtedly air on PBS, introduced by Stormin' Norman 
Mailer). From there, Leonard can go through Hagler and Duran, then fight Jake 
LaMotta for the vacant WBM antelope weight title. 
</P>
<P>
The subliminal acknowledgement of the doubts about this fight show up when 
Trainer constantly refers to Leonard and Hearns as "these young men," and Arum 
covers his product in metaphor. There has been and will be a deliberate attempt 
to persuade the public that while Leonard-Hearns I may have occured eight years 
ago, Ray and Tommy were teenagers at the time. Yet in a moment of rare candor, 
Hearns analyzed himself and Leonard, and allowed, "He's slipping. He's losing 
something as well as I am. We've both aged."

TAX EQUITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By striking down tax laws that treat citizens unequally, the U.S. and now the 
California Supreme Court may be starting to polish off Proposition 13. The 
state would benefit from that. 
</P>
<P>
The latest case represents a temporary setback for beleaguered school districts 
trying to raise money with taxes or fees imposed on developers. Voters in five 
Santa Clarita Valley school districts who were seeking more construction 
funding had imposed a tax that could have added as much as $6,300 to the cost 
of each new home. The California Supreme Court last week let stand a state 
appellate court ruling that struck down that tax. That could have wide effects 
because many California cities, counties and other election districts have 
imposed similar fees. They use the money to repair roads, build jails and 
provide other services that lost funding after Proposition 13 slashed property 
taxes in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
But the decision could be a long-term victory if its inherent logic leads to 
repeal or revision of Proposition 13. And there is nothing obscure about the 
direction of the appellate court's thinking: The tax was considered illegal 
because it was not imposed uniformly on residents and property owners but would 
be borne only by developers and future residents. The burdens of Proposition 13 
are distributed the same way. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, commercial property changes hands less frequently and so its 
owners often pay taxes at lower rates than homeowners. Even among homeowners, 
property taxes are not imposed uniformly. People who bought houses before 
Proposition 13 was passed had their property-tax assessments frozen at 1975 
levels; those assessments can only be raised by 2% a year while people who 
purchased their homes since then pay taxes based on the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
The future of Proposition 13 was jeopardized earlier this year when the U.S. 
Supreme Court struck down a West Virginia tax law. In that case, the court said 
the Constitution requires "rough equality in tax treatment of similarly 
situated properties." Clearly, Proposition 13 does not provide that rough 
equality. 
</P>
<P>
In his opinion in the Santa Clarita case, Appellate Justice H. Walter Croskey 
wrote that because the special tax was not uniformly imposed on residents, it 
doesn't meet the requirements of Proposition 13. The public has long known that 
that ballot measure provided relief for many people from unbearably high 
property taxes but also imposed sharp restrictions on how much money state 
government could raise. Now, after it has snatched financial support from so 
many government services essential to Californians, Proposition 13 may be 
losing the legal support so essential to its future.

President Bush is dead wrong in maintaining that the AK-47 is needed by the 
bigger game hunters. Our wild game is being decimated fast enough without the 
use of those infernal weapons. A hunter with a high-powered rifle should be 
satisfied with one shot at his game. If he wants to spray the target with a 
volley from an AK-47 he is no sportsman at all.

Having been on the receiving end of many AK-47 assault rifles some 20 years ago 
as a combat infantry soldier in South Vietnam, the ongoing controversy 
surrounding these weapons amazes and appalls me, especially the reported 
dramatic rise in sales of these tools of war in the face of pending regulation 
(Part I, Feb. 11). 
</P>
<P>
I cannot help but wonder what is wrong with this civilization (and I use the 
term loosely), in which some members hold a perverse fascination with a weapon 
that was used to kill a good number of the 58,000 Americans who lost their 
lives in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder how many citizens of Vietnam have the same fascination with our AR-15 
(M-16) rifle and are scurrying around their country in a similar buying frenzy. 
Anybody want to guess?

MONARCHS: HANDLE WITH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Barbara County officials are proceeding with exemplary caution and care 
in reviewing the potential impact of a massive proposed development on one of 
the most important winter colonies of Monarch butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
Five separate colonies, including the giant main colony, are at risk. The 
principal colony ranks among the three largest in western North America. The 
perils are not imaginary. Two other colonies already have been lost to nearby 
development between Hollister Avenue and U.S. 101 immediately north of the 
proposed development in the Ellwood area of Goleta. 
</P>
<P>
The 255-acre tract under consideration lies west of Isla Vista and the Ocean 
Meadows Golf Course, between Isla Vista and the Sandpiper Golf Course, on a 
splendid coastal bluff. Under the county master and coastal plans, provision is 
made for development of 300 dwellings on the site. Those plans also provide for 
the strict protection of the Monarchs. The development plan now under 
consideration appears to go beyond the density provided by the master plan, 
proposing 240 dwelling units and, in addition, a 390-room resort hotel complex. 
Scientists do not know precisely how adequate protection of the butterfly sites 
will be, regardless of the extent of the development. 
</P>
<P>
This particular Monarch site is of "immeasurable scientific value," according 
to Chris Nagano, who led efforts to tag and trace the incredible migration of 
Monarchs when he was on the scientific staff of the Los Angeles County Natural 
History Museum. "We know more about this site than probably any other in 
western North America," Nagano commented. "During the last three years -- four 
wintering seasons -- we have tagged some 25,000 Monarchs there, and have also 
collected a tremendous amount of data on such factors as butterfly clustering 
patterns within the roosts. This gives information on how the insects react to 
changing air temperature, wind and humidity levels. All of this is being used 
to protect other wintering colonies in California." Nagano is convinced that 
additional studies of two or three years are required to work out a detailed 
protection plan because of the complexity of calculating the impact and 
interrelationship among weather, physical environment, wind patterns and 
plantings. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara County officials are welcoming the collaboration of scientists 
like Nagano to make sure they succeed in their commitment to protect the 
Monarch colonies. That is reassuring.

TAX INDEXING IS BACK, BUT IN DANGER OF A NEW DEMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERNEST CONINE, Ernest Conine writes a column for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By now most Americans have forgotten the momentous change that was written into 
federal tax law in 1981 -- the "indexing" provision that prevents automatic tax 
increases from being triggered by inflation. 
</P>
<P>
But if tax indexing were to be repealed, which could easily happen if ordinary 
citizens don't keep a watchful eye, taxpayers would feel the pain quickly 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
Indexing, which has been called a tax reform that only politicians could hate, 
involves the annual adjustment of income-tax brackets and deductions to take 
account of inflation the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't produce a tax cut. Tax collections keep climbing in lock step with 
real economic growth and inflation-adjusted personal incomes. But it does save 
the taxpayer from automatic tax increases that would otherwise occur. 
</P>
<P>
Using the current inflation-adjustment figure of 4.14%, the National Taxpayers 
Union calculates that a typical family of four earning roughly $49,000 a year 
will pay about $212 less in federal income tax in 1989 than it would without 
indexing. 
</P>
<P>
If the inflation rate was 10% or more, as it was earlier in this decade, the 
benefit would be far, far greater. 
</P>
<P>
Indexing didn't actually begin until 1985, then stopped in 1987 to allow 
phasing in of the new tax reform rates and rules. Now indexing has resumed, 
without fanfare, effective with the 1989 tax year. 
</P>
<P>
Tax indexing, however, will be a very tempting target as Congress and the 
Administration shop for politically acceptable ways of making room for new 
spending programs and/or cuts in the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers are impressive. 
</P>
<P>
If you assume an average inflation rate of 4.6%, the Congressional Budget 
Office says that federal taxpayers will pay about $128 billion less over the 
next five years than they would in the absence of indexing. 
</P>
<P>
Looked at another way, that means tax revenues could be raised by $128 billion, 
simply by repealing tax indexing. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush didn't mention indexing in his budget message to Congress, and 
so far there is no significant move for repeal on Capitol Hill. But that could 
change. 
</P>
<P>
It's worth noting that Drew Lewis, the Republican co-chairman of a bipartisan 
commission studying the deficit, included suspension of tax indexing on his 
list of revenue-raising options that "have merit." 
</P>
<P>
Repeal of indexing shows up perennially on the Congressional Budget Office's 
list of options for tax increases. And, truth to tell, most politicians would 
be happier without indexing precisely because of the extra revenues that 
inflation-driven "bracket creep" otherwise produces. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to understand how the system worked before indexing. Say living 
costs were rising by 8% a year and a worker's pay increased by the same 
percentage. The purchasing power of his paycheck nonetheless went down because 
his raise threw him into a higher tax bracket. His tax obligation rose faster 
than his pay. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians found the inflation dividend convenient. The system effectively 
produced large tax increases without Congress having to vote for them. However, 
the movement for tax indexing -- which had existed for years in some countries 
-- became irresistible with the rise of double-digit inflation in the late 
1970s and early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1981 act, the standard deduction for married taxpayers filing jointly 
is expected to increase by $200 this year. The 28% tax bracket will begin to 
apply at $30,950 of taxable income for married couples, up $1,200 from 1988. 
</P>
<P>
If tax indexing is under-appreciated, it is partly because inflation had fallen 
to around 4% by the time indexing took effect in 1985. It has been relatively 
tame ever since. 
</P>
<P>
However, even at the present modest level of inflation, indexing brings 
significant savings to the average family. Those savings will become much 
larger and more important if fears of renewed inflation prove well-founded. 
</P>
<P>
But any calls for repeal or suspension of indexing should be rejected not just 
by people who read George Bush's lips, but even by those who consider higher 
taxes inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Indexing, keep in mind, is not a rich man's tax loophole. On the contrary, 
low-income families would feel the pain of repeal far more than people making 
several times as much. The meaning of indexing to a millionaire is near zero. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the question of plain honesty. Indexing forces the government to 
justify a tax increase instead of letting taxes rise automatically with no 
legislative action. And by removing the government's ability to raise taxes 
without an explicit vote of Congress, indexing encourages greater discipline in 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, once repealed it might never be possible to enact indexing again. 
</P>
<P>
Economic realities may make a tax increase the lesser of evils. The American 
people, however, would do well to keep their elected representatives on notice 
that any tax hike should be debated and passed in the open -- not through 
repeal or erosion of one of the most important safeguards in the tax laws.

SELL-OUT IN CENTRAL AMERICA; 
</P>
<P>
YEARS OF U.S. DEMOCRACY-BUILDING ARE UNRAVELING FAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED C. IKLE, Fred C. Ikle, undersecretary of defense for policy in the 
Reagan Administration, is now affiliated with the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies, Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The road to serfdom is paved with promises to hold elections. Once again the 
people of Nicaragua have been promised that their Sandinista rulers will hold 
free and fair elections. A new agreement reached among the presidents of the 
four Central American democracies and Daniel Ortega provides that democratic 
elections will be held in Nicaragua next February. But this agreement also 
mandates that a plan be formulated first for disbanding and dispersing all the 
Contras -- the armed resistance forces who have long fought for democratic 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
The first time the Nicaraguan communists promised free elections was in July, 
1979, even before they had achieved full control of the country. That promise 
was rewarded by the Organization of American States' recognition U.S. financial 
support. A more recent promise of elections was made a year and a half ago as 
part of the so-called Arias plan, and it provided the rationale for Congress to 
refuse further military assistance to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the Contras were still in a strong position. If they had received 
but a fraction of the military and moral support that Congress generously gave 
the Afghan freedom fighters, they could have rallied and mobilized the strong 
resentment of the Nicaraguan population against the communist government. This, 
in turn, might have forced the Nicaraguan rulers some time ago to hold free 
elections. Thus, as we watched the withdrawal of Soviet forces from 
Afghanistan, we might also have seen the withdrawal from Nicaragua of Cuban 
military advisers and secret-police experts -- together with the departure of 
the Sandinista junta for a long holiday in Havana. Such a turn of events would 
have given heart to the Christian Democrats in El Salvador and helped their 
president win over more of the insurgents for a fair political contest, free of 
terrorism and violence. 
</P>
<P>
This is what might have been. In the 1980s we traveled on a fast road toward a 
democratic order for all of Central America. First, democracy came to El 
Salvador and Honduras, then to Guatemala. By mid-1987, Nicaragua seemed to be 
next. But at that point, the Reagan Administration's policy failed disastrously 
-- not in Nicaragua, but on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
That disaster now imposes a heavy burden on the Bush Administration. It would 
be futile, though, to try to revive the Reagan Administration policy. Given 
today's majority view in Congress, President Bush is right in shelving the idea 
for renewed military assistance for the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Central America is no longer on the fast road toward a democratic order. 
</P>
<P>
In El Salvador, the communist insurgents gained enormous encouragement from the 
United States' abandonment of the Contras -- and gained steadier sources for 
arms supplies as well. The Salvadoran government forces and people begin to 
despair. This despair almost certainly will deepen in the coming months when 
Congress addresses the question of next year's aid for El Salvador. Already, 
various organizations in the United States are hard at work on an agenda to 
pressure Congress to terminate military aid for El Salvador, or at least to cut 
it drastically. The arguments will be familiar: human-rights violations 
committed by the government forces, the need for reaching a political 
compromise with the insurgents (note, the Sandinistas did not have to negotiate 
with the Contras!) and that Central America should be left to sort out its own 
problems without Yankee intervention. 
</P>
<P>
In Guatemala the communist forces will want to imitate the successes of their 
comrades in Nicaragua and El Salvador. At the same time, the autocratic 
elements in the Guatemalan army will become increasingly restive. Not a good 
prospect for Guatemala's fragile democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Honduras, finally, will feel hopelessly squeezed between the successful 
insurgents in El Salvador and the huge Sandinista army in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more and more Central Americans will seek to escape repression and 
misery by fleeing to the United States. Our state and local governments should 
get ready to receive new waves of immigrants from Nicaragua, El Salvador, 
Guatemala and Honduras. The problems of Central America will thus again land in 
the lap of Congress. Angry constituents from Miami to Los Angeles will demand 
that their representatives in Washington "do something." Alas, our options will 
be very limited. 
</P>
<P>
Some Americans propose that negotiations with Mikhail Gorbachev could solve our 
problems in Central America. But cutting off Soviet military aid wouldn't help 
much; with the Contras no longer fighting, the Nicaraguan arsenals now hold 
enough supplies to support all the insurgencies in Central America for many 
years. As for the refugee problem -- surely we can't ask Gorbachev to solve 
that; we wouldn't want him to imprison Central Americans behind barbed wire and 
minefields like the East Germans. 
</P>
<P>
Congress will soon wake to the fact that its own writ has shaped a new order 
for Central America, based on four precepts: (1) Anti-communist resistance 
forces will be denied U.S. military aid. (2) Communist governments and 
resistance forces can receive Soviet military aid (although we will complain 
about it). (3) Democratic governments must negotiate with totalitarian 
insurgent forces (for example, El Salvador), but totalitarian regimes need not 
negotiate with democratic resistance movements (for example, Nicaragua). (4) We 
will cut our military and economic aid to democratic governments if they don't 
abide by the preceding three rules.

THE URGENCY FACTOR FOR MIDDLE EAST PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILTON VIORST, Milton Viorst, a Washington writer, covers the Middle East 
for the New Yorker. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Absorbed by the demands of organizing a new Administration, George Bush may not 
have noticed the dark cloud that blew in over the Middle East a few weeks ago, 
begging some show of urgency of a President who has refused to be hurried. 
</P>
<P>
The cloud blew in from Paris, where 150 nations met to consider proposals for 
reducing the dangers of the apparent spread of chemical and, perhaps, 
biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of the major powers, the meeting turned out to be a contest 
between the haves and have-nots -- the measure in this case being the bomb. The 
have-nots were a shade unhappy with rules proposed by the nuclear club: In 
addition to closing its ranks to further members, it wanted no competing (and 
much less exclusive) poison-gas club to be set up, either. 
</P>
<P>
The issue takes on particular gravity as it applies to the Middle East. The 
Arabs accept the premise -- as does most of the rest of the world -- that 
Israel already possesses nuclear arms. The Israelis do not deny it. In 
response, the Arabs have articulated the rather troublesome doctrine that they 
are entitled to possess chemical weapons as a balance. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unacceptable," said Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh in Paris, 
"given continued Israeli occupation and the disequilibrium existing in our 
region, to adopt selective concepts and methods aimed at disarmament concerning 
only one kind of mass-destruction weapon without taking into account the need 
of disarmament concerning other forms." 
</P>
<P>
The problem in the Middle East, as we know from painful experience, is that the 
people who issue deadly threats are probably not bluffing. 
</P>
<P>
The Israelis have never enunciated a nuclear doctrine, but it is generally 
assumed that if Israel were about to be overwhelmed in a war, they would draw 
the Big One out of the arsenal. They have also shown that they have the 
missiles to deliver it. 
</P>
<P>
What the Arabs are saying now is that if Israel gives in to such a temptation, 
they will come right back with a nasty dose of chemicals. The Iraqis 
demonstrated during their war with Iran that they know how to use them. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, if a war were to start, a messy exchange between nukes and gas is 
not a far-fetched scenario. And until a peace is reached, the prospect of 
another war remains alive. 
</P>
<P>
Within the State Department, there is a school of thought -- for which, I 
suppose, we should thank Henry A. Kissinger, who founded it in the years before 
the Yom Kippur War -- which holds that it makes sense to try for an 
Arab-Israeli settlement only after the two sides have bloodied each other. An 
argument could be made that the theory was validated after thousands died in 
1973. But that was when wars between Arabs and Israelis were waged quickly and 
on battlefields, not in cities where millions of noncombatants on both sides 
are likely to die. 
</P>
<P>
As long as these wars were contained, the superpowers could assist their 
clients while themselves sitting back, growling at each other. What we do not 
know is how Washington and Moscow would respond toeach other in a massive war, 
which would spread poison as well as death. It is a good bet that the next one 
will be massive, jeopardizing more than the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, since young Palestinians hurled the first stones of the intifada more 
than a year ago, the region has been transformed. Replacing the heavy despair 
that pervaded the Palestinians for two decades is a heady sense of expectation, 
fostered by the American decision last December to begin talks with the 
Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Many Israelis, too, have -- with a sigh of relief -- taken Washington's 
decision to mean that it has at least chosen to shift its weight from the 
status quo to promotion of a peace settlement. In the minds of most Middle 
Easterners, the only question that remains is when Bush will drop the other 
shoe. If he takes too long, inviting back despair, he risks expanding the 
intifada into a full-scale war of terror. He also encourages Arab extremists, 
particularly the dissidents within the PLO, to believe that their cause is not 
lost. The consequences of both to achieving peace could be grievous. 
</P>
<P>
The President must have a major peace initiative ready for Israel's prime 
minister, Yitzak Shamir, when he arrives here for a visit next month. The 
chance of an Arab-Israeli settlement has never been so promising, but if he 
allows American involvement to drift, the prospect will be lost. 
</P>
<P>
The Middle East cannot afford another war. Neither can the United States.

THE BARGAIN CORNER: MEXICO HOTEL PASS FOR LONGER TRIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're planning a long stay in Mexico, check into the Golden Pass program of 
Los Angeles-based Mexico Travel Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
The program offers 15 or 30 consecutive nights at six Hoteles Dubin in Mexico 
City, Taxco, Acapulco and Tehuacan. You can create your own itinerary and 
divide your time between any of the hotels and cities. 
</P>
<P>
For example, you can spend some time in Mexico City, go to Taxco and Acapulco, 
then return to Mexico City. Accommodations, however, are on a space-available 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
Two a la carte meals a day -- an American breakfast and lunch or dinner -- are 
part of the program. You can choose the menu. Beverages, including coffee, tea 
and tips are extra, but hotel and food taxes are included in the pass. 
</P>
<P>
Until April 30 the 15-day pass costs $299 per person, the 30-day $499. These 
are the same prices as during the 1987-88 winter season. It averages less than 
$20 a night for the 15-day pass and close to $17 a night for the longer pass. 
</P>
<P>
The program will continue beyond April 30, but costs for then are not yet 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels in Mexico City participating in the program are the Reforma and Vasco de 
Quiroga, both in the capital's central Pink Zone, which has or is close to many 
popular attractions. 
</P>
<P>
In Taxco you have a choice between the Hotel de la Borda or Hotel Rancho 
Taxco-Victoria. You can also sleep at one hotel in Taxco while having dining 
privileges at the other. 
</P>
<P>
The Casablanca Hotel in Acapulco is not a beach property. It's on a hill 
overlooking the city and the bay in the old part of town, offering sweeping 
views. 
</P>
<P>
The Hacienda Spa Penafiel is used in Tehuacan. An inland city with 
colonial/historic attractions as well as spa resorts, Tehuacan is not far from 
Oaxaca and Puebla. The pass includes play at a nine-hole golf course in 
Tehuacan. 
</P>
<P>
At least the first night's room should be booked before departure. Subsequent 
reservations in Mexico can be made at your hotel or at any of MTA's offices in 
Mexico City and Acapulco. No refunds for unused nights. Contact travel agents.

RETRACING BYRON'S STEPS IN 'GLORIOUS EDEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY LOWRY, Lowry is a Wayland, Mass., free-lance writer.

<DATELINE>
<P>
SINTRA, Portugal 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of all the words spoken and sung about Sintra, poet George Gordon Noel Byron's 
had the most lasting effect. When he put this flowering mountain town in 
"Childe Harold" he put Sintra on the map. "Glorious Eden," he called the city. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever he stayed Byron was taken with Sintra. He wrote his mother: "Sintra . 
. . contains beauties of every description, natural and artificial. Palaces and 
gardens rising in the midst of rocks, cataracts and precipices; convents on 
stupendous heights, a distant view of the sea and the Tagus." 
</P>
<P>
Sintra, 17 miles north of Lisbon, hasn't changed much from that description. 
Open are castles, convents, botanical gardens and Pena Palace, the wedding-cake 
structure that crowns the Serra de Sintra. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looks Like Balmoral 
</P>
<P>
Pena Palace was built by a cousin of Queen Victoria's Albert and resembles 
Balmoral on the inside, although it is more like Bavaria's Neuschwanstein on 
the outside. 
</P>
<P>
When Byron visited the mountain was topped by a monastery built by Manuel I in 
gratitude for the safe return of Vasco da Gama. The king was hunting on the 
mountain when the fleet was spied entering home waters. Monastery ruins include 
a chapel, an alabaster altar and a cloister. 
</P>
<P>
Farther down Pena Ridge, Byron undoubtedly walked the parapets of Castelo dos 
Mouros, an 8th-Century Arab stronghold later occupied by Norsemen. In the clear 
mountain air, views are still amazing. 
</P>
<P>
We know he hiked to Capuchos to see the Convento de Santa Cruz, a Capuchin 
monastery carved in the rock and insulated -- as well as furnished -- with 
cork. 
</P>
<P>
St. Honorius, a hermit who lived in a cave nearby, gets credit lines in Byron's 
poem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Capuchos Monastery 
</P>
<P>
Capuchos is still a dark warren. Visitors are shown where eight penitents at a 
time lived in discomfort, despite such facilities as an infirmary, a dining 
room, a kitchen and an indoor bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Byron probably strode on to Colares, a town of vineyards and villas, pausing 
for bread, cheese and claret in a small taverna. 
</P>
<P>
An English merchant, Francis Cook, 40 years later claimed that Byron inspired 
him to import eminent horticulturists to the old monastery grounds at 
Monserrate to oversee exotica from Africa as well as Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Cook then built a bizarre neo-Oriental mansion for which he could blame no one 
but himself. 
</P>
<P>
Still later, another Englishman acquired Monserrate, sold the antique 
furnishings at a profit and proposed to divide the property into house plots. 
As shudders ran down the mountain, the Portuguese government stepped in and 
declared the place a national treasure. 
</P>
<P>
Today the gardens of Pena and Monserrate feature more than 3,000 plants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Twin Chimneys 
</P>
<P>
The distinctive twin chimneys of the Royal Palace of Sintra reminded Hans 
Christian Andersen of champagne bottles when he visited in 1866. 
</P>
<P>
Byron ignored them in "Childe Harold." 
</P>
<P>
The palace began as the home of a Moorish potentate, was taken by Alfonso 
Henriques, the first king of Portugal, in 1147, and early in the 15th Century 
was rebuilt as a summer palace for King Joao. 
</P>
<P>
A century later more additions were made by Manuel I, who lived there and was 
called "the Fortunate King." 
</P>
<P>
The romantic interior has a Swan Room that commemorates the wedding of Princess 
Isabela and Philip of Burgundy, and a Magpie Room -- to reprimand palace 
gossips after the king was caught kissing a lady-in-waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Sintra's highland setting has always drawn those wilted by the summer heat of 
Lisbon, but it has remained a serene place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Casinos and Beaches 
</P>
<P>
Casinos and condos belong to Estoril and Cascais at the foot of the mountain, a 
short trip by auto or bus. Equally convenient for today's visitor are the 
Atlantic Ocean beaches and such seaside villages as Ericeira, where lobsters 
are bred in nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
The Serra de Sintra ends in a spectacular cliff at Cabo da Roca, the 
westernmost point of Europe and a great place to watch the sunset. 
</P>
<P>
Mafra, the combination Franciscan monastery and royal palace, was the object of 
a day's hike for Byron. The 800-room edifice included a 35,000-volume library, 
the pride of Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
Byron afterward told of the monk who guided them through and who asked politely 
if there were "any books in England?" 
</P>
<P>
Byron does not mention fog or mists, so he must have been as fortunate as we in 
having clear skies. It can be damp and gloomy at times, especially around 
Capuchos and Castelo dos Mouros. Byron would have appreciated the ghost 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
Displaced European nobility and expatriate Britishers still own the country 
estates -- the quintas -- of Sintra. 
</P>
<P>
Several quintas have become country-house hotels at which the line between paid 
and invited guests is casually drawn and the bedrooms are full of 
museum-quality antiques. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Swimming Pools 
</P>
<P>
Swimming pools and tennis courts dapple the manicured grounds. The horses and 
flower gardens are cloned from Kent. 
</P>
<P>
In Byron's eyes no place on the grand tour matched Sintra. He would write from 
Greece of a town "in the most beautiful situation (always excepting Sintra in 
Portugal) I ever beheld." 
</P>
<P>
He was not alone in praise. Robert Southey, English poet and historian, and 
William Beckford, an English author, also enticed British tourists to undertake 
what was then a rough ocean voyage. Portuguese poets would sing of it as "a 
garden of earthly Paradise" and claim "here is Spring enthroned." 
</P>
<P>
Andersen observed that some aspect of Sintra inevitably reminded the visitor of 
home. He saw in Sintra flashes of Denmark as we see California compared to New 
England. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen also said that Byron had stayed in "a private house now the Hotel 
Lawrence" on the Setais-Monserrate road. No hostelry of that name survives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Actually Three Towns 
</P>
<P>
Sintra is really three towns rising one after another on the mountain, with the 
oldest at the summit. 
</P>
<P>
On a second or fourth Sunday you can attend the street market in Sao Pedro de 
Sintra. Curio and antique shops are open in the Santa Maria section of town 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
It may not be that the cheese tarts known as Quejadas de Sintra were invented 
in Byron's day, nor that the cooks of 1809 added a mound of sauteed shrimp to 
the fresh-fried mountain trout "in the Sintra manner." 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Byron visited only four days, July 12-16, then went to Spain, 
Greece and Turkey. Even Eden didn't hold the 21-year-old Byron for long. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Car rentals at the Lisbon airport begin at $124 a week plus 16% tax for a 
Citroen Visa with unlimited mileage. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Palacio dos Seteais, 2700 Sintra, has 18 rooms, including two suites. 
It's a five-star hotel, $120 and up, double occupancy, including continental 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Tivoli Sintra, 2710 Sintra, has 70 rooms. It's a four-star hotel on the 
Praca da Republica, about $50 double. 
</P>
<P>
Quinta Sao Thiago, 2710 Sintra, a private manor house, has seven doubles and 
two singles. It's about $70 for two with breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Condos for Rent 
</P>
<P>
Guest houses and B&amp;Bs may be booked at the tourist office. There are condos 
for rent in Cascais and Estoril, and hotels in all classes. 
</P>
<P>
The nearest pousada (government inn) is Pousada do Castelo, a nine-room castle 
on the coast at Obidos. 
</P>
<P>
Palacio dos Seteais has a notable dining room. Dinner for two costs about $40. 
Reservations are essential. 
</P>
<P>
Galeria Real, Sao Pedro, in a building full of antique shops and history, 
serves dinner for two for $45. 
</P>
<P>
A Tiborna, opposite the Royal Palace, is a small cafe with good service and 
inexpensive food. 
</P>

CRUISE VIEWS: HOW TO COMPLAIN AND MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH, Slater and Basch are Los Angeles free-lance 
writers. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Would you book a cruise that advertised like this? 
</P>
<P>
"You'll have fun aboard the friendly 30-year-old SS Rustbottom, which failed 
her last five sanitation inspections in spite of heavily spiking the drinking 
water with chlorine. 
</P>
<P>
"Our bottom-of-the-line cabins are so small that you have to take turns getting 
dressed, and our menus are created by a Miami-based computer programmed to give 
you the maximum number of calories for the lowest possible cost. 
</P>
<P>
"Our inexperienced and incompetent staff could not care less about your comfort 
or pleasure, and the residents of our popular ports of call make their 
livelihoods by harassing you in the streets to buy their overpriced souvenirs." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently a few readers did. At least that's the gist of some recent passenger 
complaint letters sent our way, indicating that there are times when "the 
customer is always right" turns into caveat emptor (let the buyer beware). 
</P>
<P>
What are some of the things that make passengers angry? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Biggest Complaint 
</P>
<P>
First and foremost seem to be promises the passenger felt were implied in the 
brochure or claimed were made by the travel agent or cruise line booking agent 
before the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Ambiguous terms such as first class, deluxe, elegance and five star -- typical 
hyperbole created by ad agency copywriters who may never have been aboard the 
ship -- are echoed bitterly by the disappointed letter writers who expected 
something grander than they received. 
</P>
<P>
Some expectations appear unrealistic to more experienced cruisers: 24-hour room 
service does not necessarily mean that hot four-course meals are served in the 
cabin in the wee small hours, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
And no cruise-savvy travel agent would promise clients that they could spend 
the entire disembarkation and turnaround day aboard ship until time to catch 
their evening flight home. 
</P>
<P>
Other complaints, however, are more troublesome. Two Midwestern readers last 
year reported vexing plumbing and ventilation problems aboard two small vessels 
-- Exploration's Majestic Explorer (out of service at present) and the 
Ambassador (being refurbished). 
</P>
<P>
A well-traveled California couple aboard Ocean's Ocean Princess, on the first 
South American sailing after a three-week refitting in drydock, complained 
about faulty air conditioning and noisy construction work during the cruise. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger on Admiral's Azure Seas last winter was annoyed by a daylong 
carpeting installation outside her cabin, followed by a severe winter storm 
that knocked out dinner service, felled most aboard with seasickness and forced 
cancellation of a scheduled Ensenada port call. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Language Problems 
</P>
<P>
The only two American couples aboard a Russian cruise ship not long ago were 
astonished to find that virtually no one spoke English and that their fellow 
passengers, most of them West Germans, were not particularly sociable in a 
second language. 
</P>
<P>
One passenger complained about small cabins on RCCL's Nordic Prince, although 
the standard cabin photograph and diagram in the ship's brochure clearly shows 
that two beds, a stool and dressing table fill the room. 
</P>
<P>
Like beauty, satisfaction often depends on the eye of the beholder. A report on 
Carnival's Holiday brought one reader's complaints about "plain, uninspiring 
food" and "unimaginative, limited activities," while another reader was so 
pleased with the same ship that she booked a second cruise six months later. 
</P>
<P>
What should you do when you have a complaint? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Take it immediately to the person responsible for that area of service: to 
the housekeeper if it involves the cabin or cabin service, to the maitre 
d'hotel or chief steward if it is a dining room complaint and to one of the 
purser's staff if it has to do with ship charges or procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Speak calmly and explain the situation in a reasonable tone of voice, and it 
should be corrected. If not, go to a higher-up, normally the hotel manager or 
chief purser. Seething silently or complaining to other passengers only 
aggravates the annoyance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use the Questionnaire 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the questionnaire you're given at the end of the cruise, point out any 
problems you have encountered. Everyone up to and including the chairman of the 
board and the shipowner read them whenever there is a serious complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If you want a smooth, trouble-free sailing, avoid any shakedown, inaugural, 
maiden voyage or first sailings on the heels of major renovations. Although 
some ships have sailed through them with flying colors, this is when the vessel 
is most vulnerable to plumbing, heating, air conditioning and water-pressure 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If you are considering booking a ship that never sails from a U. S. port, 
and your travel agent does not have firsthand knowledge of the ship, take some 
time to check on it before putting down a deposit. 
</P>
<P>
Some lesser-known ships or very low-priced sailings may feature discounted 
cabins left over from a group or charter or a cruise marketed primarily in 
another country, and you could find yourself odd man out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When dealing with waiters and stewards to whom English is a second or third 
language, speak slowly and distinctly and be ready with an alternative word 
when they don't understand your initial request. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles woman was infuriated recently on a Royal Viking sailing when her 
cabin stewardess didn't know what a cantaloupe was; if she'd asked for a melon, 
she would have gotten a serving of breakfast fruit instead of the envelope that 
was delivered by a bewildered Scandinavian. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finally, read the fine print at the end of the company brochure and on the 
back of your ticket/contract. You'll find that the line is usually not 
responsible for missed ports of call, changed itineraries or liabilities in 
connection with independent contractors such as airlines or ground tour 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most unusual complaint came from a man who wrote: "Do all cruises 
have a casino? My wife loves the casino and spends a good portion of the trip 
(there) . . . I don't like the casino and for this reason hesitate to take 
another cruise together. I am enclosing a stamped, self-addressed envelope for 
your response. The return address, of course, is (that of) a friend; I wouldn't 
want my wife to know that I pursued this." 
</P>
<P>
We were happy to send him, in care of his friend, a list of American-flag 
vessels and small expedition ships that do not carry slot machines or blackjack 
tables.

TRAVELER'S DIARY: TAKING A TRIP TO THE RESORT LAND OF YOUR DREAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HORACE SUTTON, Sutton is a New York City syndicated travel columnist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If most travelers are given a choice they would take off for a dream world that 
exists beyond the daily workaday life and beyond the borders of an ordinary 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to meet those desires, developers -- stretched from Walt Disney's 
"Imagineers" in Florida and in California to the far-out dreamers in Hawaii -- 
have ready-to-serve realities. 
</P>
<P>
Americans are taking about 400-million trips a year, with vacation excursions 
accounting for a 16% rise in the last five years and resort travel jumping 5% 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt, which has 32 resorts around the world, expects to spend $3 billion in 
the next five years, putting up extravagant shelters at Wailea and on Kauai in 
Hawaii; in Aruba; at Beaver Creek, Colo., and at the new resort complex at Nusa 
Dua in Bali, where former President Reagan and Nancy stayed. 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt has attached the word "fantasy" to these resorts, and none is more of a 
dream world than the $360-million, 1,241-room extravaganza it operates at 
Waikoloa on the island of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The resort, which is traversed by a fleet of launches as well as by a tubular 
tram, is a product of the quintessential fantasy fancier Christopher Hemmeter, 
who has another playland called Kauai Lagoons, managed by Westin. 
</P>
<P>
Occupancy at the Waikoloa fantasy, a month after the September opening, ran 15 
points over the industry average. It is often sold out on weekends and fantasy 
fanciers can spend up to $1,000 a couple a night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drive a Race Car 
</P>
<P>
Among the offerings by the fantasy desk there are learning how to drive a race 
car; holding a private dinner party at Hulihee Palace, a landmark of Hawaii's 
monarchy days (printed personalized menus included); a helicopter picnic at the 
edge of a 300-foot cliff; spending a day as a Hawaiian cowboy learning how to 
herd sheep on a motorcycle or a horse. 
</P>
<P>
Then one can have dinner for two at a secluded beach reached by a 45-foot 
sailboat chartered just for you, and joining the dolphins for a play period 
after learning how to "talk" to them and give hand signals. That little number 
costs $55 for adults, $45 for children. 
</P>
<P>
On the books in Las Vegas is a $1.2-billion resort called Pharaoh's Kingdom. It 
will have rooms for 5,000, a gaming area that measures 280,000 square feet, a 
convention center and a $100-million spa. 
</P>
<P>
But that's only for starters. In the middle of the desert they'll create a 
jungle-fringed lagoon with its own beach, an Egyptian city as it may have 
appeared in Tut's time -- but underwater, this time -- and an underwater 
seafood restaurant. Add to all that an amusement park put together by Disney. 
</P>
<P>
Children, to be sure, are allowed to have fantasies too. In the middle of 
Indianapolis the old railroad station has vintage railroad cars that have been 
rebuilt as hotel suites -- two to a car. The train car suites occupy 13 Pullman 
car sleepers all resting on their original tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Linblad's tours have had their Antarctic customers swimming in the seas at the 
bottom of the world. Try that for dinner-party conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Or tell about Finnair's eight-day excursions to Lapland beyond the Arctic 
Circle -- snowmobiling to Lapp villages or living through the nightless summer 
nights and dining in a tepee, with visits to Helsinki and Stockholm and 
free-of-visa sailings to Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fantasy Weekends 
</P>
<P>
For those with little time but big dreams there are even fantasy weekends. The 
Hilton at Short Hills, N.J., runs a 24-karat weekend that starts when a 
chauffeur picks you up at Newark Airport, then offers a bottle of Dom Perignon 
champagne in the limousine. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen roses await in the deluxe suite, where a chef and serenading violinist 
attend the couple at dinner in the suite. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gift Certificate 
</P>
<P>
A choice of Japanese or Swedish massages awaits, as does a $100 gift 
certificate for shopping at a nearby mall. All that for $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the Grand Hyatt in New York City offered -- steady now -- a $10,000 
weekend . . . without air fare. 
</P>
<P>
It included the presidential suite, chauffeurs and limousines, caviar and a 
continuous flow of champagne, as well as tickets to "Phantom of the Opera," a 
limo to the theater, Regine's for dinner and over to Christie's to get measured 
for a mink. Yes, madame got to keep the coat. There were two takers.

TALE OF TERROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Claudia Capos' article, "Dracula Is Being Rediscovered in Romania" (Feb. 12), 
was tainted by one major error. Although I always believed author Bram Stoker 
was a Scot, I'll accept her contention that he was Irish. But she says that in 
Stoker's tale Jonathan Harker went to Dracula's Carpathian Castle. Not so. It 
was the realtor, Renfield, who made that forbidding journey and was offered a 
crucifix for protection by the superstitious burghers of the Borgo Pass. 
Despite this, Renfield fell under Dracula's spell while there to obtain the 
count's signature on the lease to Carfax Abbey. The estate Stoker used as a 
model can be seen if one visits Yorkshire, England, where he wrote the Gothic 
horror tale.

A WEATHER UPDATE

<TEXT>
<P>
"Viewing Upper Egypt From a Boat on the Nile" (Jan. 29), by Shirley Slater and 
Harry Basch, was interesting and informative. As I am quite familiar with the 
Nile Valley from Luxor to the Sudan at various times of the year, I was amazed 
to read that October was recommended as the best month for weather, for October 
is still very hot! January and February always have been recognized as the very 
best months, with maximum temperatures in the low 80s and the nights quite 
chilly. However, their advice on women's conservative wearing apparel should be 
well heeded in all Arab nations.

Peter Greenberg, who wrote "Nursery at 25,000 Feet" (Jan. 29), needs to do a 
lot more homework before writing another such article. First, you cannot 
compare a domestic deregulated airline with a government supported 
international foreign carrier. 
</P>
<P>
If the mothers would like to have all this help, they and everyone else should 
be prepared to pay two or three times the cost of their tickets to pay for the 
personnel that would be involved. Two, the size of the aircraft dictates the 
space for conveniences such as fold-out changing tables. Contrary to 
Greenberg's statement regarding U.S. carriers, Continental for one, has 
bassinets that can be attached to bulkheads on all its DC-10s. 
</P>
<P>
Third, as for the mother who was given a seat separate from her child, I would 
suggest she arrive at the airport a little earlier. For the mother seated next 
to two single parents, be aware that there are only so many oxygen masks per 
row and it is illegal to have more people in the seats than there are masks. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines charge full fare for unaccompanied minors as they are legally 
responsible for them. The diligent care taken is considerable. However, you 
would be surprised at how many of these "concerned" parents are not there when 
their child arrives. The airlines and flight attendants try their best to 
accommodate special needs, but the passenger has to meet them halfway.

HER WORLD: A DELAYED VACATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan is a La Jolla free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I awakened and saw the pearly sky above the alarm clock that had failed to 
ring, I knew I'd missed my flight. 
</P>
<P>
I shouted, bit my lip, punched my pillow. 
</P>
<P>
Then I sat up and faced facts: because of close connections between San Diego 
and the British Virgin Islands, my short vacation was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Even worse, I was flying to Tortola in the Virgin Islands to go sailing with 
friends. My delay would affect their plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Check Available Space 
</P>
<P>
I dialed American Airlines and confessed. They were polite, but said that 
nothing could be settled by telephone: I must present myself at the airport 
within two hours. They would have to check available space for an upgrade to 
first-class, even with my thousands of American Advantage miles. 
</P>
<P>
I had carefully packed the night before and laid out the clothes I would wear: 
an eggplant denim skirt and jacket over a white linen shirt. A broad-brimmed 
straw hat, a string bag and pale beige flats. After dressing, I turned up my 
car heater and drove to Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
The airport was quiet. The morning rush had ended. The ticket agent, who took 
to his computer to see what could be done, was like a professor who wanted to 
let me make up a missed exam. He read his monitor, clucked and shook his head. 
He punched more numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"This happens most often when people are going on vacation," he said. "They 
relax a little early. People rarely miss business trips." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overnight Necessary 
</P>
<P>
I could start toward Tortola, it turned out, but I would have to overnight in 
Dallas or San Juan, Puerto Rico. The agent suggested waiting 24 hours, and this 
time getting it right. 
</P>
<P>
I pocketed my new ticket and thanked him for his help. I wondered what to do 
next. I had said goodby to the office. I had cut off my chance to return home 
immediately by arranging for carpet cleaners that day. 
</P>
<P>
I straightened my straw hat, buttoned my cotton jacket against the February 
chill and drove to the harbor-front cluster of shops and cafes known as Seaport 
Village. 
</P>
<P>
It was early. Parking was easy. At the bookshop-coffeehouse of Upstart, Crow 
&amp; Co. I ordered a tall cup of mocha espresso. I eavesdropped on the patter 
of passers-by, happy tourists who had arrived at their destination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shopping Spree 
</P>
<P>
Then I remembered the slogan: "When the going gets tough, the tough go 
shopping." I headed for the bright lights of Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
A salesperson with curly dark hair said she liked my straw hat. I admitted that 
I had planned to be on my way to the Caribbean at that hour but had missed the 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
She was sympathetic. Last fall she had missed a plane to Miami, which meant 
that she missed a cruise ship bound for Mexico. A travel agent gave her the 
wrong flight time. To try to recoup some vacation she flew to Cozumel, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"There I was, standing on the beach in the wind and the rain, waiting for my 
ship to come in," she said. "It got nearer and nearer and then it began backing 
away. It was that hurricane -- Gilbert -- and the ship could not dock. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst part was what happened when I went back to the resort and looked for 
the ladies' room. There was a pool of crocodiles just outside the door. With 
the winds and the heavy rains, the water level was up and the crocodiles were 
trying to crawl out." 
</P>
<P>
She began laughing at the memory. She reminded me that I was on vacation, even 
though I had not yet left town. 
</P>
<P>
I checked the movie listings at Horton Plaza and settled for a midweek matinee 
with four sailors and a couple of elderly shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
The film fit the occasion: "The Accidental Tourist."

TRIP OF THE WEEK: HORSING AROUND IN THE DESERT 
</P>

PALM SPRINGS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Riding in a golf cart isn't the only way to enjoy the outdoors in this desert 
resort town. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can saddle up for leisurely horseback trips on trails that wind 
through unspoiled landscape to America's most magnificent palm oases. 
</P>
<P>
Although Palm Springs' rustic dude ranches have been replaced by golf courses 
and luxurious hotels, Smoke Tree Stables still keeps a corral of horses near 
the pristine Agua Caliente Indian canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Smoke Tree is the last public stable in Palm Springs. Would-be cowboys and 
cowgirls have been renting horses there since 1929, and city fathers recently 
gave owner Rod Johnson permission to keep his stable open for at least 10 more 
years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Horse Trails 
</P>
<P>
The area has about 135 miles of horse trails that offer visitors close views of 
desert plants and wildlife. Hourlong rides go through mostly dry Palm Canyon 
Wash at the base of Smoke Tree Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
But longer and more interesting outings lead to streams and shady palm groves 
in remote Andreas, Murray and Palm canyons. You can stay in the saddle for two 
or four hours on the canyon rides, all guided by wranglers from the stable. 
</P>
<P>
To get to Smoke Tree from Los Angeles, drive east on Interstate 10 to the Palm 
Springs turnoff, California 111. 
</P>
<P>
Follow the highway (also called Palm Canyon Drive) south through town. Soon 
after it swings east, turn right at Sunrise Way. Take La Verne Way and then go 
left on Toledo Avenue to the stable entrance at No. 2500, where the street 
meets Murray Canyon Drive. 
</P>
<P>
(Don't turn in at Smoke Tree Ranch, a residential development.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Riders of All Ages 
</P>
<P>
Smoke Tree Stables welcomes riders of all ages. Parents can ride with a small 
child in the same saddle. Hours are 8 a.m. until dusk. One-hour rides are 
offered on the hour for $15; no reservations required. 
</P>
<P>
More popular are the two-hour trips to Andreas Canyon that depart at 8 a.m. and 
10 a.m. and at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. They cost $33.50, including the equestrian 
entry fee to the Indian reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the experience and desire of the riders the horses will walk, trot 
or lope along the trail at the command of the wrangler who guides the trip. 
</P>
<P>
From the stable the path enters a sandy wash between Smoke Tree Mountain and a 
flood-control dike bordering the Canyon Country Club golf course. Then it 
narrows and crosses a couple of streams that carry the runoff of melted snow 
from higher elevations before entering Agua Caliente tribal land. 
</P>
<P>
After stopping at a booth to pay the admission fee, the wrangler leads horses 
and riders through a landscape of palo verde trees, creosote bush, jumping 
cholla and other cactus. Willow leaves rustle in the desert breeze and birds 
flit from their hiding places at the sound of hoofs striking rocks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Into the Canyons 
</P>
<P>
The trail twists toward a canyon of California fan palms, botanically named 
Washingtonia filifera in honor of the first President. Many have survived for 
several centuries, including some with blackened trunks from a fire in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The horses usually pause to drink from an icy stream that nourishes the oasis 
of palms, cottonwoods, sycamores and thick undergrowth. There's not much time 
to linger before heading back to the stable, but you may find Indian caves and 
grinding rocks near the picnic tables. 
</P>
<P>
On a four-hour horseback excursion to Murray Canyon, another oasis on Indian 
land, riders can dismount for a bring-your-own picnic lunch among the palms. An 
option is to forgo lunch and continue on a longer trail that circles back to 
the stable. 
</P>
<P>
The Murray Canyon trip must be arranged in advance and requires four or more 
riders. It costs $63.50 each, including admission to the reservation. For the 
same price, horsemen can mount up with a wrangler for a four-hour outing to 
Palm Canyon, the area's largest palm oasis. 
</P>
<P>
For more information on Palm Springs trail rides, call Smoke Tree Stables at 
(619) 327-1372. 
</P>
<P>
Before or after your equestrian adventure, take an even closer look at desert 
plant life by visiting Moorten Botanical Garden. This is the 50th anniversary 
of a remarkable collection of desert plants that has grown to 3,000 varieties. 
</P>
<P>
From the stables, follow Murray Canyon Road west to South Palm Canyon Drive, 
then turn right (north) to No. 1701. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Moorten and her late husband, known as Cactus Slim, established the garden 
around their home as a result of botanical and geological expeditions that 
began in the 1930s. They collected plants locally, in Mexico and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
A walk around the grounds is like a world tour, with specimens from a Baja 
boojum to an African thorn tree. Especially fascinating in the enclosed 
"cactarium" are plants with names such as "Snowball," "Old Man's Whiskers," 
"Mink Tail" and "Devil's Fingers." 
</P>
<P>
The thick vegetation has turned the property into a bird sanctuary, especially 
for about 200 mourning doves. Also look for the white temple doves from Egypt 
that are part of wedding ceremonies held frequently at the garden. 
</P>
<P>
Pat and her son, Clark, welcome visitors every day. Admission costs $1.50 and 
includes a map for an informal tour of the grounds. The garden opens at 9 a.m., 
Sundays at 10 a.m. Some of the Moorten's home-raised cactus plants are for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Two blocks north is California 111, which you can rejoin to reach Interstate 10 
for the trip back to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip from Los Angeles to Palm Springs is 230 miles.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: AMERICANS URGED TO VISIT ANYWHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been said that Americans are like Bulgarian wine -- they don't travel very 
well. As a group, Americans are considered to be some of the least adventurous 
people in the world. 
</P>
<P>
We're predictable. In the summer we go to Europe. In the winter we go skiing. 
One of the reasons may be that we scare very easily. 
</P>
<P>
One isolated terrorist incident or bombing, and we run. In many cases we've 
allowed these actions to restrict our travel and vacation agendas. 
</P>
<P>
It's unfortunate. It is safe for Americans to travel anywhere in the world, 
except for a few places. 
</P>
<P>
The United States prohibits Americans from traveling to only one country -- 
Lebanon. (Americans can even visit Libya -- they just can't work there.) 
</P>
<P>
What about the other countries? If you want to go to North Korea, can you go? 
How about Nicaragua, Iran, South Africa, Ethiopia or Haiti? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
You Can Get There 
</P>
<P>
Before you wince and run for cover, consider this: You can get there, and with 
ease. 
</P>
<P>
With some planning you can even have a great time in the process. A growing 
number of specialty tour firms and travel agents offer these trips on a regular 
basis. And you don't have to be a mercenary in military fatigues to sign up. 
</P>
<P>
There are countries with dangerous reputations that just aren't true. For 
example, trips to East Germany, Haiti and the Soviet Union can be easily 
arranged. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department is no longer cautioning Americans about travel within a 
100-mile radius of Chernobyl, and travel to Kiev (about 60 miles from the site 
of the April 28, 1986, disaster) is slowly rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to read beyond the headlines to determine if a country or 
destination is really as safe -- or as dangerous -- as some claim. And you can 
get such information. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department issues advisories on trouble spots around the world. It 
has advisories on 36 locations divided into eight geographic regions. The 
advisories deal with civil unrest, natural disasters and disease. 
</P>
<P>
To receive a travel advisory is simple. Dial (202) 647-5225. You can ask for a 
specific country -- assuming there is an advisory in effect for that country. 
</P>
<P>
Some advisories are strongly worded: the most recent, on travel to Afghanistan, 
warns against travel by Americans. "A high level of risk" exists, says the 
advisory. It also informs prospective travelers that the U.S. Embassy was 
evacuated of all American personnel on Jan. 31, 1989, and also warns that if 
travel to the region is a must, avoid Afghanistan's national airline, due to 
its extremely poor maintenance record. 
</P>
<P>
Another advisory warns against trekking along the Thai-Burmese border because 
there have been reports of bandits (and of course, drug traffickers). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proper Perspective 
</P>
<P>
But don't rely only on State Department advisories. Just because the State 
Department issues an advisory does not necessarily mean that a particular 
country or region of that country is unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Fiji experienced two coups in 1987. The State Department issued 
advisories. Few Americans traveled there. But there was no violence. No 
foreigners were killed. The same happened during the upheaval in the 
Philippines that preceded the departure of then-President Ferdinand Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Advisories should be treated as such, and then placed in perspective as they 
relate to your specific travel needs. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, every form of travel involves certain risks. But I've often found 
more adventure and risk in flying from Los Angeles to New York City or in 
changing planes in Atlanta than I've ever been threatened with in the West Bank 
of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Certain myths persist, however. Just ask the Turkish government how many 
Americans didn't go there -- and still don't go there -- after viewing the 
movie "Midnight Express." Or the Greek government after the Achille Lauro 
incident (which didn't even occur in Greece). 
</P>
<P>
However, there have been some changes of attitude. North Korea, once forbidden 
and closed to the West, is beginning to open its doors to tourists. So is 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently the United States has taken a particularly hard line against any 
of its citizens traveling to Vietnam, North Korea and Cuba. (While there are no 
specific State Department restrictions on U.S. citizens traveling to Cuba, 
there is a Treasury Department restriction on Americans spending U.S. currency 
in Cuba without a "license.") 
</P>
<P>
This means that no U.S. travel agent can sell tickets or book hotel rooms 
there. But if you want to go to Cuba, any number of Canadian travel agencies 
can arrange the trip and can obtain the proper Cuban visas. Also, any U.S. 
travel agent can book you a flight to Beijing, (for separate flights to 
Pyongyang) or Bangkok (for separate flights to Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Official Travel Ban 
</P>
<P>
For example, of 100,000 tourists in Nicaragua last year, 40% were Americans. 
And while the United States maintains a trade embargo against Nicaragua 
(prohibiting direct commercial flights), there is no official travel ban. 
</P>
<P>
But paradise can be found -- or disputed -- without seriously threatening your 
life. If anything, it has been argued that travel promotes world peace more 
than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, more Americans are beginning to realize that they can safely visit 
Vietnam, North Korea and Burma, that they can vacation in Central and South 
America, that they can visit Eastern European countries and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is travel to these countries possible, but being there also can be a 
rewarding experience. Well-informed travelers who break down the misperceptions 
are doing all of us a great service.

STAGE WEEK: 'LADY DAY' AND MUSIC AT THE ODYSSEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't be confused: The "Lady Day" that's opening this weekend at the Odyssey 
Theatre has nothing to do with Lainie Robertson's "Lady Day at Emerson's Bar 
&amp; Grill," the Billie Holiday concert/drama that had a short run at the 
Hollywood Playhouse in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"You haven't seen this show," explained writer-director Stephen Stahl, who 
bought the right to Holiday's life from her estate. He notes that he wrote his 
piece in 1981; Robertson followed in 1983 -- and debuted his "Lady Day" around 
the United States, while Stahl and his star Dee Dee Bridgewater were playing to 
enthusiastic houses in Paris and London. 
</P>
<P>
The format for both shows (the singer jamming with her band and speaking with 
the audience) is based on an actual 1953 Holiday "comeback" concert in London. 
</P>
<P>
"But the look, feel, and what our show has to say are very different," Stahl 
stressed. He believes his script ("based on the facts of her life; I didn't 
take much dramatic license") presents Holiday "as a warmer, more loving 
character. She just kept giving and giving love -- and never getting any back. 
In the show, she falls apart a little bit up there, but she pulls it together. 
I don't dwell on the dark side, the drugs. This is about Billie Holiday and her 
music -- the music that kept her alive to (age) 44."

BACK TO THE BOARDS: It's back to Angst for Cynthia Gibb, who's tackling the 
demanding role of Chrissy in David Rabe's "In the Boom Boom Room," opening this 
weekend at the Attic Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"The character is in the process of losing her mind," explained the actress. 
"She's insecure, frightened and struggling to find herself, validate and 
understand her existence. When we meet her, she's working in Philadelphia as a 
go-go dancer, trying to get a career started as a dancer, trying to find love 
and friendship. But everything she does is to please other people, (to) conform 
to their expectations." 
</P>
<P>
In that respect, the role bears more than a passing resemblance to Gibb's last 
outing, playing the title character in the recent TV movie "The Karen Carpenter 
Story." 
</P>
<P>
"I found a lot of similarities," she said. "But Karen was never as extreme as 
Chrissy is. This is a very dark piece. It's been known to come home with me. 
It's emotionally bracing, too -- and a good opportunity for me to spend time in 
(a small theater), test my skills . . . without 10 million people watching." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HAPPY TRAILS: Buoyed by great press and word-of-mouth, Victoria Hartman and 
Patrick Mainello's "Monsoon Christmas" has transferred to the Whitefire Theatre 
in Sherman Oaks -- and, come May, expects to move East for an Equity run. 
Co-producers Obie Bailey ("My One and Only") and Jay Cardwell ("Nunsense") are 
currently checking out spaces in New York -- as well as the possibility of a 
tryout run at Washington's Arena Stage or Kennedy Center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSS FIRE: Eduardo Machado's "A Burning Beach," a family drama set in 
1895 Cuba, recently opened at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. Bill Bushnell and 
Jose Luis Valenzuela direct. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dan Sullivan in The Times: "The production emphasizes visuals so strongly 
that one suspects a certain lack of confidence in the text . . . This is a play 
that needs momentum, not pageantry." 
</P>
<P>
From Richard Stayton in the Herald Examiner: "A search for the redeemable, 
while admirable, is in this circumstance a long haul. However, LATC's obdurate 
refusal to learn from past mistakes has led once again to a tame, old -- if 
perverse -- 'puro novela.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the Daily News, Tom Jacobs wrote: "(Machado's) characters are 
one-dimensional and basically unsympathetic. His plot is totally unfocused. His 
language is only sporadically interesting. And the production's imagery, while 
occasionally striking, isn't good enough to hold our attention for 2 1/2 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
From the L.A. Reader's Alison Sloane: "The show forsakes its integrity when its 
many levels of interaction are ignored. While the acting is adequate and often 
effective, the show is directed at such a feverishly intense pace that real 
moments of conflict lose their impact. Subtlety is repressed and melodrama 
reigns." 
</P>
<P>
From Tim Gray in Daily Variety: "There are plenty of interesting ideas and good 
intentions smoldering in 'A Burning Beach,' but none of them ever catches fire. 
It all may have sounded good on paper, but major rewrites are needed; (the) 
play seems like a blueprint for a finished work." 
</P>
<P>
Drama-Logue's T. H. McCulloh found "the play's interior strength sapped by its 
simplistic symbolism and its open-faced pamphleteering. Where subtlety would 
make the piece seductive, Machado opts for broad strokes; where shades of gray 
would entice the intellect, he sees only black and white."

NOTEBOOK: A PATOUT TO OPEN GIGI'S ON TWO FRONTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chef Gigi Patout left her family's Louisiana-style restaurant, Patout's in West 
Los Angeles, last September because, she says, "it was time to move on." 
(Patout's remains open, with Gigi's brother Andre in charge.) Her fans will be 
happy to hear, though, that she has gone into partnership with Mitzi Shore, 
proprietor of the popular Comedy Store clubs, to develop two new restaurants. 
The first of these, scheduled to open in April, is the casual, 75-seat Gigi's 
Cafe. It will be connected to the Comedy Store Playhouse, now being constructed 
on the site of the old Hollywood Playhouse on Las Palmas Avenue in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The second is a larger restaurant to be called simply Gigi's, across the street 
from the original Comedy Store on the Sunset Strip, in a house once occupied by 
John Barrymore (and later by Roy's, among other restaurants). 
</P>
<P>
"We're completely redoing the place," Patout says, "and we hope to be open by 
May. There'll be a private club on one side of the building with dancing after 
11 p.m., a 50-seat bar overlooking the city, and an 85-seat restaurant." The 
food will not have a strong Louisiana accent, though: "I don't want to be 
classified as just that kind of chef," she explains. "I want to be versatile 
and use whatever raw materials are the freshest. I guess you could call the 
style at both places sort of 'American Bar &amp; Grill.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FOOD INDIGO: This might be the beginning of one of L.A.'s first New Wave 
restaurant dynasties: Karen Salk -- daughter of Donald Salk, founding partner 
of both Spago and the late 385 North -- is about to open her own restaurant, 
Indigo, on 3rd Street in West Hollywood (in a storefront once occupied by the 
now-defunct Pink Marble Thai restaurant). Her partner is Jay Fagnano, one-time 
manager of both 385 North and Caiote. (Salk herself has worked as a manager at 
385 North and at Chez Melange in Redondo Beach, and in the kitchen at Trumps.) 
</P>
<P>
Indigo will feature what Salk calls an "Art-Deco-meets-the-tropics" interior 
designed by Barry Noel, and an eclectic, reasonably priced menu created by chef 
Tony Di Lembo (a veteran of the Beverly Market and, for two years, personal 
chef to Barbra Streisand). Dishes to be offered will include a series of 
antipasto platters with varying ethnic accents (Middle Eastern, Southwestern, 
even Italian) and unusual pizzas (including one with sauteed escarole, 
Provolone and white raisin). Top main course price will be $13.50. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant will seat about 50 people, some of them in a small patio. Salk 
hopes to be open by mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MOVING MOUNTAINS: It may be the Year of the Snake in Chinese households, but 
it's no snake year for Michael McCarty. The Santa Monica-based proprietor of 
Michael's, who ventured out of state with restaurants called the Rattlesnake 
Club in both Denver and Detroit (in partnership with chef Jimmy Schmidt), 
recently launched a third restaurant in Washington. Originally, the D.C. spot 
was to be a Rattlesnake too, but shortly before opening, McCarty and Schmidt 
decided to give it a more East Coast sort of name, Adirondacks. Maybe they were 
afraid a town full of politicians wouldn't want to be seen in a place called 
the Rattlesnake Club. And now, McCarty has announced that as of March 15, the 
Denver and Detroit Rattlesnakes will be named Adirondacks too. The Rockies have 
no comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EVENTS: Pearls restaurant at the Warner Center Marriott in Woodland Hills 
features the wines of Stonegate at a six-course wine maker's dinner to be held 
Tuesday, with the first seating at 7 p.m. and additional seatings to follow at 
half-hour intervals. The tariff is $47 per person, tax and tip included. . . . 
The Siamese Princess serves the wines of William Hill at its own first-ever 
wine maker's dinner, Thursday at 7:30 p.m. The cost is $38.50 a head, tax and 
tip not included.

<TEXT>
<P>
You've finally found a Chinese restaurant that you're sure is authentic and you 
even know what regional cuisine it specializes in. You're ready for adventure. 
But then you open the menu and are confronted with more than 100 items. Before 
you panic and order mu shu pork, consult this crib sheet: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CANTONESE: Beef tendons with anise: tendons of shin simmered for hours until 
they take on a wonderfully chewy quality. Flavor is very mild. 
</P>
<P>
Lo hon jai with fat choy, sometimes called Buddha's Vegetables: a combination 
vegetable dish that includes hair vegetable (exotic moss gathered from the 
northwestern desert). 
</P>
<P>
Thousand-year-old eggs with pickled ginger: an appetizer. 
</P>
<P>
Tripe combination with daikon: assorted innards, sometimes anise-flavored. 
</P>
<P>
Pork cake with dried scallops. 
</P>
<P>
Fried rice with dried fish: a good introduction to dried fish. 
</P>
<P>
Ung choy with either fuh yee or shrimp sauce: It's swamp spinach made with 
either fermented bean curd or shrimp sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Dim sum: Try everything you see (especially from the roving grill carts) until 
you can eat no more. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HONG KONG: Pea shoots: a newly fashionable vegetable. It's recently begun to 
appear on the menus of Hong Kong-style restaurants. The young shoots of the pea 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SHANGHAI: Vegetarian goose or duck: sheets of bean curd skin, sometimes stuffed 
with mushrooms, will resemble fowl while being tasty in their own right. 
</P>
<P>
Fried milk or cream: egg whites with milk cooked until set with bits of chicken 
liver, pine nuts over fried cellophane noodles. 
</P>
<P>
Jellied lamb: terrine of lamb in aspic, flavored with anise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHIU CHOW: Pan-fried oyster cake: omelet made of eggs, bean sprouts and plump 
oysters served with hot sauce. Essentially street food, but delicious. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SWEETS: Dou fo fa: custardy tofu that comes with warm syrup poured over it. 
</P>

STRESS ON FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY URGED BY GOVERNORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL HOUSTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A governors' task force on Saturday urged that all college graduates be 
conversant in a foreign language as part of a broad effort to make the United 
States more competitive in world trade. 
</P>
<P>
Task force chairman Gov. Thomas H. Kean (R-N.J.), who next year will become 
president of Drew University in Madison, N.J., personally recommended that 
proficiency in a second language be a requirement to graduate, although his 
group's formal report did not go that far. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, you do these things gradually," Kean said at a news conference 
launching a four-day meeting of the nation's governors on a wide range of 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suggests Numerous Ways 
</P>
<P>
The task force, suggesting numerous ways to beef up the teaching of languages 
and geography, urged that "an international focus" be incorporated in "the 
entire curriculum." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Gerald L. Baliles (D-Va.), chairman of the National Governors' Assn., 
asked during an appearance with Kean: "How are we to sell our products in a 
global economy when we neglect to learn the languages of the customer? 
</P>
<P>
"How are we to open overseas markets when other cultures are only dimly 
understood? How are our firms to provide international leadership when our 
schools are producing insular students?" 
</P>
<P>
The task force report suggested that states: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Require elementary and high school students to study world cultures and 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Include geography and world history in statewide tests of school and 
student performance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Offer foreign languages as early as first grade. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Offer foreign languages during the summer, after school and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Provide in-service training for teachers in both international studies and 
foreign languages. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Have teacher certification programs test for international awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Augment textbooks with other materials, such as maps, travel books, 
newspapers, videotapes and even stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use technology innovatively, such as linking U.S. students by telephone 
with those in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increase language and social studies requirements for admission to college. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Require an international element in all college majors, particularly in 
business school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Progress 
</P>
<P>
While generally bemoaning the lack of what it called "international education," 
the report did note some recent progress. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of four-year colleges require graduates to meet a foreign language 
requirement, it noted, although only one-sixth of these schools require a 
language course for admission. 
</P>
<P>
Also, more than half of the four-year institutions report that they have hired 
more faculty with international expertise and are offering more courses with an 
international focus. 
</P>
<P>
Among signs of progress cited in the report was the California International 
Studies Project, consisting of nine regional centers funded by the state. The 
centers offer teacher training in foreign languages, geography, economics, the 
environment and regional studies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Lesson in Chicken 
</P>
<P>
The report noted that "learning about other nations' resources and cultural 
patterns may open up new opportunities for American exports." It said that 
Baliles learned this lesson on a recent trip to Hong Kong, where he discovered 
that chicken feet were served as a delicacy -- but were in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
The governor immediately called several poultry producers in Virginia and found 
that they routinely threw chicken feet away. 
</P>
<P>
"A match was made and his state is now a supplier of chicken feet to Hong 
Kong," the report said.

COLD STUNS SOUTH; SNOWSTORM ON PATH TO NOVA SCOTIA

A cold wave that stunned the Deep South broke low temperature records all 
across Florida on Saturday, and an elderly woman froze to death in an unheated 
home in the northern part of the Sunshine State. 
</P>
<P>
Farther north, a powerful storm that dumped as much as two feet of snow on the 
middle Atlantic states on Friday buffeted the New England coast with winds up 
to 52 m.p.h. and snow while moving away toward Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
The arctic air that poured into Florida sent the mercury plunging from the 
Panhandle all the way to Key West, the southernmost point on the continental 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Florida's rich citrus growing region reported minor crop damage after the 
second night of record cold. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cold Expected to Ease 
</P>
<P>
But the cold snap was expected to ease slightly, and the trend was to warmer 
temperatures by tonight, National Weather Service forecaster Fred Gonzalez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Florida's lowest temperature overnight was a record 18 degrees in the northern 
part of the state at Tallahassee, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Other records for the day in the state were 28 at Apalachicola, 29 at Daytona 
Beach, 35 at Ft. Lauderdale, 35 at Ft. Myers, 36 at Hollywood, 24 at 
Jacksonville, 51 at Key West, 37 at Miami, 39 at Miami Beach, 30 at Orlando, 27 
at Pensacola, 31 at Tampa and 35 at West Palm Beach. In neighboring Alabama, 
Mobile tied its record of 27 and Montgomery tied its record of 22. 
</P>
<P>
Just outside Florida's capital, in Miccosukee, police said a 65-year-old woman 
froze to death in her unheated home. She was discovered unconscious by a 
neighbor and paramedics could not revive her. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Rare Occurrence' 
</P>
<P>
"This is an extremely rare occurrence in Leon County," sheriff's spokesman Dick 
Simpson said. The death prompted deputies to visit other unheated homes to 
check on residents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In other cities around Florida, shelters filled up with homeless people who 
usually sleep on the streets in more hospitable weather. 
</P>
<P>
But while Florida shivered, Dodge City, Kan., posted a record high Saturday of 
80 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service said snow was falling along the northern New 
England coast as the two-day wintry blast moved toward Nova Scotia. Strong 
winds buffeted the shoreline with gusts of 52 m.p.h., pounding Chatham, Mass., 
the weather service said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Snow Blankets Boston 
</P>
<P>
As much as 12 inches of snow fell over Cape Cod, and areas south of Boston 
reported accumulations from five to eight inches. Three to six inches of snow 
were reported across southeast New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
An afternoon winter storm warning was in effect for the southeast coast of 
Maine, where four to eight inches of snow had fallen.

VICTIM IN MANDELA SCANDAL BURIED; 
</P>
<P>
SEIPEI, 14, EULOGIZED AS FREEDOM FIGHTER IN S. AFRICA RITES

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A thousand singing and chanting mourners turned out in this rural black 
township Saturday to bury favored son Stompie Mokhetsi Seipei, the 14-year-old 
militant anti-apartheid leader whose murder has been blamed on Winnie Mandela's 
band of young bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
"Stompie, your terribly violent death was an unspeakable crime," Methodist 
Bishop Peter Storey said as he gazed at the small, gray and white wooden 
casket. "But your childhood was already dead. South Africa took away your 
innocence." 
</P>
<P>
The white-haired clergyman then voiced a plea for the country's black majority 
to heal the wounds created by allegations against Mandela and her live-in 
bodyguards, the so-called Mandela United soccer club. 
</P>
<P>
"Retaliation cannot bring this child back to life," Storey said. "Do not injure 
Stompie further by using this funeral as a platform for revenge." 
</P>
<P>
Mourners stood atop the wooden pews in St. John the Baptist Church, singing 
freedom songs, clapping their hands and chanting support for the guerrilla war 
being waged against Pretoria by the exiled African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Young Lion' 
</P>
<P>
Stompie was eulogized as a courageous freedom fighter, "a young lion" of the 
liberation movement who, at the age of 11, was the youngest person ever 
detained by the South African authorities and who later commanded a 
1,000-strong army of children under 14 in this township. 
</P>
<P>
But the funeral and burial here, 75 miles south of Johannesburg, was subdued 
compared to other political funerals in South Africa in recent years. No one 
mentioned the special circumstances of Stompie's death. And neither Mandela nor 
any members of her bodyguard force were present -- or mentioned by name. 
</P>
<P>
Stompie and three men in their 20s were abducted Dec. 29 from the Methodist 
church home of the Rev. Paul Verryn, a white pastor, in the sprawling Soweto 
township near Johannesburg. Police and civic leaders say the kidnapers were 
members of Mandela United, the controversial soccer club whose members serve as 
live-in bodyguards for Mandela, wife of jailed nationalist leader Nelson R. 
Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
The four were taken to Mandela's red-brick Soweto home, where they were beaten, 
according to police and sources in the township. The body of Stompie, whom 
Mandela United members had accused of being a police informer, was found eight 
days later. He had been beaten beyond recognition and stabbed in the throat, 
the coroner said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Charged 
</P>
<P>
One of the three survivors escaped and the other two were released after 
anti-apartheid leaders intervened with Mandela. So far, the soccer team coach 
and a team member have been charged with murder in the case. The team bus 
driver has been arrested but not charged. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who has denied involvement in Stompie's death, claims her bodyguards 
were trying to protect the four men, whom she asserted were being sexually 
molested by Verryn, the pastor. Verryn and the Methodist church deny the 
assertions. 
</P>
<P>
Resentment over the team's activities has been growing for months in Soweto, 
and anti-apartheid activists fear that community anger with the Mandela soccer 
club already has spilled over into a bloody factional war. 
</P>
<P>
A Mandela United team member was killed last month, for example, and on 
Wednesday a 13-year-old was shot to death when a gang of unidentified men 
opened fire on the home of activists accused in the team member's murder. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC, the primary guerrilla group fighting white-minority rule, issued a 
statement Saturday from its exile headquarters in Zambia calling on blacks to 
avoid "fratricidal" attacks in the townships. 
</P>
<P>
The message here also was conciliatory. 
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't point fingers at other people," said McLean Skhosane, a Tumahole 
political activist who conducted the funeral. "Stompo was interested in unity. 
Let his death not divide us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mandela Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Leading anti-apartheid activists, angered by the soccer team's activities and 
Mandela's unwillingness to disband the group, recently called on South African 
blacks to distance themselves from Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's funeral was the first for a political activist not restricted by 
authorities since the current state of emergency was declared in 1986. Some 
political analysts say that Mandela's troubles, and the rivalries among 
anti-apartheid groups, help bolster government assertions that a South Africa 
under black rule would be characterized by violent disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
"The government likes to say this was just another case of blacks killing 
blacks," the Rev. Lewis Balink, the church pastor, said before the services 
began. "But the people know better. They know it was the system (apartheid) 
that killed him." 
</P>
<P>
"We confess with shame the way it (Stompie's life) was ended," Storey said in 
his funeral prayer. "(But) this land's violence can insinuate itself into all 
our souls." 
</P>

Verryn spoke for the first time publicly since the four men were abducted from 
his church hostel, which has provided shelter in Soweto to hundreds of young 
activists such as Stompie. 
</P>
<P>
"I have lost a friend. I have lost someone who has challenged me. I have lost a 
freedom fighter," Verryn said of Stompie. "May his soul rest in peace."

POLISH PAPER PRINTS RARE ACCOUNT OF '81 SHOOTING OF 9 MINERS

An official Polish newspaper Saturday published a rare account of the police 
shooting of nine miners in 1981, the bloodiest confrontation during a crackdown 
that suppressed the Solidarity trade movement. 
</P>
<P>
The killings near the southern city of Katowice have become a symbol of the 
brutality of the effort to suppress the Soviet Bloc's only independent trade 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
"In order that wounds could cure completely, it is necessary to expose them . . 
. ," said the article in the weekly Odrodzenie, or Rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
The battle began when miners went on strike to protest authorities' attempts to 
quash Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
The article quotes witnesses who described how police entered the Wujek mine in 
a tank and armored personnel carriers and attacked the miners with tear gas, 
water cannons and grenades. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw the tank enter the mine's ground, breaking the barricade we had 
erected," the article quoted Kazimierz Rembilas, a former mine employee, as 
saying. "Then shots were fired. In the noise and chaos one could not see who 
was shooting and from which direction. There was a moment of shock. I heard 
cries: 'They are killed.' Even then I could not believe they were shooting at 
us."

BARBARA BUSH REVELS IN VISIT TO PLACE SHE CALLS '2ND HOME'

Today was a day for culture and reminiscing for First Lady Barbara Bush, who 
said her "only regret" was that it would be considered improper for a First 
Lady to take off down a street on a bicycle, as she used to do when the Bushes 
lived here in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that restriction, Mrs. Bush said her seventh trip to China is "a very 
exciting visit. I feel like we've come to our second home." 
</P>
<P>
From the morning service at the Chong Wen Men Christian Church, the First Lady 
left her husband and set out for tea at a restored Qing Dynasty residence and 
later, a tour of the Forbidden City. 
</P>
<P>
She had tea and pastries and watched Chinese dancing with more than 30 Chinese 
women at Prince Gong Wang Fu's mansion. The prince was the great uncle of Pu 
Yi, China's last emperor. 
</P>
<P>
It is said that when Pu was a very young child -- he became emperor at age 3 in 
1909 -- he visited his uncle at the mansion where the tea was held. In a chilly 
theater room with bare concrete floors and elaborately hand-painted walls and 
ceilings, Barbara Bush was led by a costumed dancer to sit at each of the 11 
tables for about three minutes to chat with the visitors, who included 
diplomatic spouses and women in Chinese government, culture and education. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere was relaxed, and at one point Xie Rongjin, a magazine editor who 
served as Charlton Heston's interpreter when Heston directed a production of 
"The Caine Mutiny" here last year, came up and got the First Lady's autograph 
on her luncheon program. 
</P>
<P>
A band playing Chinese instruments performed traditional music but enlivened 
the proceedings toward the end by playing a rousing "Yankee Doodle," with the 
audience clapping along. 
</P>
<P>
The tea was hosted by Bette Bao Lord, author of "Spring Moon," who is the wife 
of the U.S. ambassador Winston Lord. 
</P>
<P>
The visit was seen as significant because the mansion and its grounds were only 
recently opened to the public. The late Premier Chou En-lai is said to have 
insisted that the estate, which had been Beijing's grandest private garden and 
residence during the Qing dynasty, be left intact for future restoration. About 
one-third of the compound has been restored at a cost of 6 million yuan ($1.6 
million).

TO LONG BEACH VICTIMS, TRAVEL DESCRIBED THE ESSENCE OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Anthony and Barbara Fallon loved to travel. They filled big scrapbooks with 
mementos from trips all over the world. Friends say they collected matchbook 
covers, place mats, ticket stubs -- always scouring for the "tackiest 
souvenirs," which they displayed in a case in their Long Beach living room. 
</P>
<P>
And so when Fallon, 49, an engineer with Chevron, had to go to Sydney, 
Australia, on a two-week business trip, his 48-year-old wife accompanied him, 
as she often did. En route Friday, the couple were among the nine passengers 
sucked out of United Airlines Flight 811 when the wall of the plane blew away 
at 20,000 feet about 50 miles out of Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
"They died doing what they wanted to do -- traveling over the ocean," a friend, 
Chris Ericksen, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Much to Come Back To' 
</P>
<P>
"They had so much to come back to," said another friend, Norma Barber, who has 
lived across the street from the Fallons for more than 10 years. " . . . I'm so 
numb, now." 
</P>
<P>
The couple were supposed to return in time for Tony's 50th birthday party, 
scheduled for March 18. Hundreds of friends had been invited to their house, 
two blocks from the beach, in the Belmont Shore area. 
</P>
<P>
"They were probably close friends with 50 people," Ericksen said. "I think Tony 
and Barbara had more close friends than anyone I know." 
</P>
<P>
Fallon sang and played guitar at Christmas parties and other gatherings "with a 
great deal of enthusiasm and a fair amount of skill," Ericksen recalled. "They 
were great people to be around, a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Tony was described as a slight, mustachioed man whose thinning hair was usually 
covered by a hat. Barbara, with dark hair and a "very ready smile," was active 
in the local arts community. Both were born in Southern California. They had no 
children; she had a daughter from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friends in Shock 
</P>
<P>
At the Alamitos Bay Yacht Club, where the Fallons often relaxed, friends were 
in "shock and dismay" over the loss, said Ericksen, who is commodore of the 
club. Fallon had been commodore in 1986. He also was on a committee that 
organized the qualifying regattas in Long Beach for the 1984 Olympics, Ericksen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was suggested that Saturday's regatta be canceled in remembrance, 
Ericksen said the idea was abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
"They would have wanted this to go on," he said. "If they were here, they would 
sail. I think they would want us to . . . . I could see them sitting on the 
patio having a beer." 
</P>
<P>
The gentle breeze billowing their sails, three dinghies moved across Alamitos 
Bay. It was the kind of day Saturday, friends say, the Fallons would have 
loved. But their 25-foot Coronado sailboat, Sea Shanty, remained moored in the 
harbor.

SALMAN RUSHDIE AND KHOMEINI'S OUTRAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As American writers we believe in free speech, and defend Salman Rushdie's 
right to publish his books without fear of physical reprisal. 
</P>
<P>
Although many Muslims are genuinely distressed and offended by Rushdie's book, 
they should be equally outraged by the terrorist fanatics in Iran who have put 
a bounty on his head. Islam teaches moderation. The bullying actions of 
Khomeini and other fundamentalist clerics who have offered money to murder an 
author is a greater outrage than anything Rushdie may have written. 
</P>
<P>
If Rushdie's book is offensive to Muslims, they have the right to protest 
against it, to write letters of complaint to his publishers, to shun him or 
despise him in any way they want. But to threaten to kill him or bomb his 
publishers is an immoral act, an affront to democratic principles, and to 
international law. 
</P>
<P>
We believe that freedom of expression is the very atmosphere of democracy, the 
cornerstone of our liberty. The principle at stake here is an important one to 
us, for as writers we exercise it every day of our lives. We are not judging 
the merits or defects of Rushdie's book, but are voicing the sentiments of John 
Stuart Mill, who said: "If all mankind, minus one, were of one opinion, and 
only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more 
justified in silencing that one person, then he, if he had the power, would be 
justified in silencing mankind."

SLOW-GROWTH RULINGS A BLESSING IN DISGUISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in recent months, an Orange County Superior Court judge has 
set aside a slow-growth initiative because it failed to pass legal muster. 
</P>
<P>
This time Judge William F. McDonald ruled last Tuesday that the slow-growth 
Measure X, which was narrowly approved by voters in San Juan Capistrano last 
November, is unconstitutional. The court noted that the measure placed an 
unfair burden on builders by requiring them not only to solve traffic, public 
works and safety problems that their new developments might create, but to also 
correct existing problems that were caused by someone else. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, Superior Court Judge John C. Woolley made the same ruling in a 
similar case challenging an initiative approved by San Clemente voters last 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers believe that it is just a matter of time before a similar 
growth-control measure passed by Costa Mesa voters last November is taken to 
court. 
</P>
<P>
The legal setbacks are not surprising. In addition to taking an inequitable 
approach that would burden developers with problems not of their own making, 
initiatives like the countywide Measure A rejected by voters last June were 
confusing, poorly draw documents that would have created as many problems as 
they sought to solve. 
</P>
<P>
One positive aspect of the legal rulings is that after two defeats in the 
courts, leaders of the slow-growth initiative drives finally seem ready to take 
a different tack. They are now talking of shifting efforts and possibly 
mounting legal challenges to specific projects, as they did earlier this month 
in defeating the Cypress Downs development on the Los Alamitos Race Course 
grounds and the Home Ranch project in Costa Mesa last November. 
</P>
<P>
Zeroing in on particular developments that local residents consider to be 
environmentally undesirable is an approach much to be preferred over shotgun 
attacks on all development. Aside from the constitutional problems involved, 
the initiative process is too inflexible, costly and time-consuming to use to 
control land-use. 
</P>
<P>
For example, using the initiative would lock local officials into the language 
initially approved by voters. Any subsequent changes needed to make the 
initiative or a development plan workable would then require putting the issue 
back on the ballot for another election. 
</P>
<P>
Growth and development must be properly planned. Developers must be held 
accountable to the community and to residents who are frustrated by increased 
traffic congestion and other environmental losses that irresponsible growth 
produces. That accountability frequently takes the shape these days of 
developer agreements that require builders to offset the overload on public 
works that their projects cause. Such guarantees must be part of any project 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
But it should be understood that developers do not pick up the entire bill. The 
cost for those public works is passed on to new home buyers. The added fees 
only further inflate housing costs, forcing more people working here to live 
elsewhere, adding to the already crucial traffic problem. It is a vicious cycle 
that no one city can adequately resolve. That is why the court rejections of 
ill-conceived slow-growth initiatives are a blessing in disguise. Maybe now 
local officials, supported by residents and slow-growth advocates, will begin 
taking a regional approach to the problems.

A LATE TEE TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I moved to Yorba Linda, way back in 1965, no woman sat on the U.S. Supreme 
Court. No woman had ever been nominated for the vice presidency on a major 
party ticket. There were no women astronauts. And women journalists were not 
admitted to the National Press Club in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Today, all that, and much more, has changed -- except, it seems, in Yorba Linda 
("Woman Golfer Tees Off at Club's Policies," Orange County section, Feb. 17). 
There, women apparently do not merit equal treatment with their male 
counterparts at the golf course, whether they go there to network with business 
associates, enjoy the great outdoors or just pursue a little white ball across 
the fairways. 
</P>
<P>
Come on, fellows! We are only about 11 years away from the 21st Century!

THE POLITICS OF ENFORCEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp has just insulted the intelligence of every 
voting Californian. On Feb. 6, Van de Kamp charged Republican Assemblyman John 
Lewis with forgery on campaign mailers. 
</P>
<P>
What makes this ridiculous is that two county district attorneys and Van de 
Kamp's own staff refused the case because there was no case. His office turned 
the case down 2 years ago. The difference now is that Van de Kamp is running 
for governor in 1990 and needs to portray himself as some sort of "ethics 
enforcer." I assure you he is no such thing. He is prosecuting selectively, 
according to political party. 
</P>
<P>
The people of this state are being duped by a professional politician on a 
witch hunt. I hope the people who live in Lewis' district realize this. Lewis 
is being victimized by Van de Kamp, who is preying on our suspicious nature of 
elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
I believe strongly that corrupt political officials should be held accountable 
for their actions, and it is this same belief in justice that drives me to 
defend a political official who is unjustly accused and victimized. I would 
hate to see a good legislator ruined for the wrong reasons. Wouldn't you?

Re: "Dannemeyer's Meeting Disrupted by Gay Activists," Orange County section, 
Feb. 15: 
</P>
<P>
The homosexual activists who attended the Dannemeyer community meeting in Yorba 
Linda got exactly what they wanted, a newspaper story chronicling their antics 
and a review of Dannemeyer's voting record and attitude toward AIDS. So much 
for simple-minded reporting. 
</P>
<P>
The real story that developed during the meeting was the loathing and, yes, 
even hatred that the activists elicited from the remainder of the audience. The 
200 residents, largely elderly, who attended the meeting -- hoping to have a 
meaningful discussion with their elected representative -- were thwarted in 
their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the terrible tragedy of AIDS, the gay-rights group made no friends nor 
gained any supporters. I'll wager that, if polled at the end of the meeting, 
the majority of the residents would vote to withhold their tax dollars to help 
this particular group in any way.

AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL CHAPTER BAN ON CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a new property owner in Mission Viejo, I would like to express my deep 
disappointment that a very authoritarian approach is being taken to restrict 
student-initiated educational endeavors. I am referring to an attempt to squash 
the formation of an Amnesty International chapter among the students, despite 
its widespread acceptance at high schools around the country. 
</P>
<P>
I understand and support the exclusion of religious groups from the campus, as 
it would violate the separation of church and state, but I see no righteous 
reason to block a secular chapter of Amnesty International. I see far more 
reasons to welcome such an endeavor of young citizens and future leaders. Not 
only does it enhance leadership skills, it also teaches cultural and political 
geography as it forces its members to learn more about the countries where the 
political prisoners are located. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, I believe that the lack of support for AI by school district officials 
is politically motivated and does not reflect the best interests of the 
students. Unfortunately, today in our society organized sympathetic concern for 
oppressed people is shunned as "liberal" and therefore bad. 
</P>
<P>
As we live in a conservative region of the state (though recent surveys 
conducted by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates find Orange County residents to 
be far less conservative when asked about specific issues), elected officials 
fear the loss of their office if they appear to be supporting "liberalism". 
</P>
<P>
By opposing AI on campus, however, they are discouraging curiosity and concern 
among students, much needed traits in an age of apathy that many fear will 
create mediocre leaders. What message will the district be giving to students 
if it bans AI? How are young people today supposed to develop a strong moral 
code and concern for their community if discouraged by the very adults to whom 
they are supposed to look for guidance? 
</P>
<P>
It is not enough to preach that young people ought to say "no" to drugs; they 
must be able to say "yes" to those impulses which are good and constructive. 
</P>
<P>
To deny students an AI chapter on the basis that there is a rule against 
"non-academic" organizations on campus during school hours is to place the 
importance of arbitrary rules above the needs of students. If there is no 
better reason than the fact a rule exists, then maybe the rule should be 
changed.

LEGAL ABORTIONS AND OTHER CHOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I sympathize with the woman (S.L. Davis, Letters, Feb. 19) who shared 
information about her ordeal while having an illegal abortion. I agree 
wholeheartedly that no woman should be subjected to such pain and suffering. 
However, it seems that she had other choices. It appears that she yielded to 
the pressures of her husband instead of seeking competent medical advice and, 
possibly, having her child adopted, which might have been safer at that point. 
</P>
<P>
My firsthand experience concerns an RH-negative mother who was advised by her 
obstetrician not to become pregnant. The woman and her doctor later learned 
that she was pregnant. She subsequently had a legal abortion at an advanced 
state of pregnancy. Her baby weighed over 2 pounds.

It was a healthy, beautifully formed male child who actually cried and alerted 
the hospital laboratory staff. The infant was then placed in an intensive care 
unit of the hospital. My colleagues and I were shocked. We cared for this 
little infant. Unfortunately, because of the traumatic birth, heroic efforts 
failed to keep him alive for more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
As I write this, I am still incensed that this particular abortion took place. 
I fear that all too often, abortion privileges have been abused. It is in 
observing and touching little victims that one is moved to address concerns 
over legalized abortion.

A PLEA TO END DAYLIGHT WASTING TIME SOONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Feb. 15 was about 57 days after the winter solstice. Oct. 29, 1988, was about 
57 days before the winter solstice. The hours of daylight are the same Oct. 29 
and Feb. 15 (i.e., the length of time between sunrise and sunset). 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 29, we were forced to change from daylight-saving time to standard time 
(daylight-wasting time). 
</P>
<P>
I do not understand why we change time Oct. 29, but whatever the arguments were 
for that change, they should now work in reverse and should require the change 
back to daylight-saving time now, rather than in April or May.

DANTLEY SCORES 32; MAVERICKS WIN BY 34 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Adrian Dantley had a stuttering start as a Maverick in Dallas, but he was a 
roaring success in his second game. 
</P>
<P>
Dantley came off the bench to score 32 points Saturday night and lead the 
Mavericks on a 127-93 romp over the Washington Bullets at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
After going 0 for 7 Friday night when the Mavericks were pounded by the Golden 
State Warriors, 127-92, it figured that Dantley, who delayed reporting for 
eight days after being traded by Detroit for Mark Aguirre, would make amends. 
</P>
<P>
Dantley and Rolando Blackman teamed up to lead a 28-8 run that started late in 
the second quarter and broke the game open. 
</P>
<P>
Dantley was 11 for 14 from the field and a perfect 10 for 10 from the line in 
just 29 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
After his performance in his debut at Dallas, Dantley apologized. "I was 
terrible out there," he told the Associated Press. "I've got to get used to my 
teammates and they've got to get used to me." 
</P>
<P>
It certainly didn't take long and the Mavericks played probably their best game 
since they lost Roy Tarpley because of drug rehabilitation. They ended the 
Bullets' three-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
By the fourth quarter Dantley, who hit the first shot he took when he entered 
the game in the first quarter, had the sellout crowd on its feet shouting. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we played well," Coach John MacLeod said, "but don't forget the 
Bullets were tired after playing at fever pitch last night to beat the Knicks 
and then flying here." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 113, New Jersey 95 -- The player the Pistons received for Dantley, 
Aguirre, was brilliant in his fourth game with his new club. 
</P>
<P>
In this game at East Rutherford, N.J., Aguirre scored 31 points in just 26 
minutes. He too was deadly, making 12 of 16 field goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
After making only six of their first 19 shots and falling behind, 16-12, the 
Pistons turned deadly, making 40 of their last 68 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really concerned with scoring," Aguirre said. "I'm just trying to 
hustle, work hard and contribute any way I can. Whatever scoring I get will be 
that much extra." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Nets are 21-34, another sellout crowd of 20,049 showed up to cheer 
the hustling young Nets. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento 97, Seattle 94 -- Dale Ellis has had a big season, but he picked a 
poor time to go stone cold at Seattle, and it caused the SuperSonics to lose a 
shocker. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, averaging 28 points and sinking 51.4% of his shots, made only three of 
17 and had just 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Smith, with 24 points and 12 assists, led the Kings to just their fourth 
victory in 28 road games. They dropped the third-place Sonics 3 1/2 games 
behind the Lakers in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
Wayman Tisdale, who complained of not enough playing time before Indiana traded 
him to the Kings, had no complaints. He had 20 points and eight rebounds in 44 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 125, Chicago 95 -- Every once in awhile the Hawks resemble the team 
that many people thought was the favorite to win the championship in the NBA 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
In winning their sixth win in the last seven games, the Hawks could do no wrong 
at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
They overwhelmed the Bulls on the boards, 58-29, they kept the ball out of 
Michael Jordan's hands and had scoring punch from Moses Malone and Glenn 
Rivers. Both scored 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls, who played a tough game Friday night with Houston, stayed close for 
a half, but when Atlanta took charge in the third and stretched a 60-55 lead to 
94-71 Jordan left, never to return. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte 124, San Antonio 113 -- Kelly Tripucka and Kurt Rambis, two of the 
more experienced players on the expansion team, led the Hornets to their 15th 
victory in this game at Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Tripucka scored 40 points and had nine assists and Rambis had 16 points and a 
career-high 22 rebounds. It was the 10th consecutive loss for the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 121, Houston 105 -- While the big men did a good job of holding down 
Akeem Olajuwon at Milwaukee, the Bucks' guards destroyed the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
Bouncing back from their collapse on Friday night against Boston, the Bucks 
jumped in front early and never were in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Pressey had 25 points and Jay Humphries, the other starter in the 
backcourt, had 20. Backup Ricky Pierce had 22 and Sidney Moncrief, just getting 
back in shape from a knee injury, had six in just 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon had 26 points and 10 rebounds, but the Rockets lost their fourth in a 
row on the road and trail Utah in the Midwest Division by 1 1/2 games. DAN

COWBOYS ARE SOLD; LANDRY OUT AS COACH; 
</P>
<P>
HURRICANES' JOHNSON TAKES REINS IN $140-MILLION DEAL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Landry's 29-year career as the only head coach the Dallas Cowboys have ever 
had ended Saturday night when an Arkansas oilman bought the team and named the 
University of Miami's Jimmy Johnson coach. 
</P>
<P>
Team owner H.R. (Bum) Bright announced that the Cowboys had been sold for an 
estimated $140 million to Jerry Jones, a longtime friend of Johnson. Bright 
said Jones, 46, of Little Rock, Ark., "will be the most enthusiastic owner that 
the Cowboys have ever had." 
</P>
<P>
Landry, who took over the Cowboys when they were a ragged expansion team in 
1960 and led them to the Super Bowl five times, was the major victim of the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
He was anything but "Old Stone Face" when two nervous messengers told him he 
was no longer the Cowboys' coach, going so far as to wipe away a tear. 
</P>
<P>
"Tommy was emotional," said club President Tex Schramm, whose voice choked with 
emotion. "It's hard to give up a relationship with an organization after 29 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Landry shook hands after the 40-minute meeting near the 18th green of the Jack 
Nicklaus-designed golf course at the Hills of Lakeway near Austin, where Landry 
has a villa. 
</P>
<P>
Jones described the meeting as "a very awkward and trying thing. It's the most 
inadequate I've ever been in my life. If you had graded my conversation, I 
would have gotten an F." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Landry lost out to a man who is 19 years his junior. Only three 
weeks ago, the 64-year-old Landry said he was willing to coach into the 1990s 
if the new owners would allow him to. 
</P>
<P>
Landry was never given that chance, and didn't get an opportunity to redeem the 
3-13 disaster of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom Landry is like Bear Bryant to me," said Jones, who left open the 
possibility that Landry could remain a part of the Cowboys' organization. 
</P>
<P>
"He's Vince Lombardi to me," Jones said. "If you love competitors, he's an 
angel. . . . Let me tell you this, Jimmy Johnson would be the first to tell you 
he couldn't carry Tom's water bucket." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said Johnson returned to Miami on Saturday and had not yet made any 
decisions about his Dallas assistants. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the sale, rumored since Thursday, came at a news conference 
that began at 8:22 p.m., CST, Saturday at the Cowboys' Valley Ranch 
headquarters about 25 miles northeast of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
The news conference was scheduled to have begun at 7 p.m. but was delayed 
because Jones and Schramm flew in Jones' private jet to Austin to inform Landry 
personally that he was being replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Schramm's voice broke and tears welled in his eyes as he talked of the visit 
with Landry. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very difficult meeting, difficult and sad," said Schramm, who will 
retain his role with the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough when you break a relationship that you have had for 29 years. But I 
am glad the ownership problem has been cleared up. It's good for the ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
Schramm, who was the architect of the Cowboys and actually hired Landry for the 
original owner, Clint Murchison, survived the new sale. However, responding to 
a report that one of Schramm's duties will be to teach Jones' son, Steven 
Jones, 24, the ropes of the organization, Jones said: 
</P>
<P>
"You got that wrong. It's me that's going to be the apprentice of Tex Schramm." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said the Cowboys will draft UCLA quarterback Troy Aikman with their No. 1 
pick in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no player Johnson thinks any more of than Aikman," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he paid for the team, Jones said, "That's between Bum and me, but I 
don't mind telling you I'm going to need some lead in my back pocket. I'm going 
to leave Dallas lighter than when I came in." 
</P>
<P>
While Jones will be the majority partner, there will be five minority owners, 
including Ed Smith of Houston, who had 27% under Bright's ownership. The other 
minority owners include Charles Wily, Sam Wily and Evan Wily. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the news conference, Smith confirmed to the Associated Press 
that Landry was out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad deal, and Tom Landry and Tex Schramm were the only reasons I got 
into owning some of the Cowboys' stock," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom should have gotten out two or three years ago. We shouldn't have had to 
tell him to get out. But what are you going to do when you only have 38,000 
people showing up at the stadium and you are losing hard cash?" Smith asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom just had to go, and we shouldn't have had to tell him." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said Jones "will build an excellent team and organization here. I want to 
tell you, this is one class guy. He went all the way to Austin to tell Landry 
first hand, and he didn't have to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said he shook hands with Bright Thursday morning to close the deal. 
Schramm said he found out Friday morning about what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
Jones first visited the Cowboy complex last September, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked around with my jaw dropped, all day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson flew into Dallas on Jones' private plane Friday, before the ink dried 
on the contract between Bright and Jones, who was captain of Arkansas' unbeaten 
1964 team. Among Jones' teammates on that national championship team were 
Johnson and current Arkansas Coach Ken Hatfield. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who went to Miami in 1984 after five years as head coach at Oklahoma 
State, had a 52-9 record in five seasons as the Hurricanes' head coach and took 
them to the national championship in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Landry's record with the Cowboys was 250-162-6. 
</P>
<P>
His Dallas teams won 13 division championships, five NFC titles and two Super 
Bowl championships. They defeated Miami, 24-3, in Super Bowl VI at New Orleans 
on Jan. 16, 1972, and beat Denver, 27-10, in Super Bowl XII at New Orleans on 
Jan. 15, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
He was tied with former Green Bay Packers coach Curly Lambeau for consecutive 
seasons coaching the same team with 29. 
</P>
<P>
Landry was a defensive coach for the New York Giants when he became head coach 
of the Cowboys in 1960, their first season. He was an innovator of the 4-3 
defense that later became known as the Flex. He brought the Shotgun offense 
back to life in the 1970s after it had lain dormant in the NFL for almost two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Landry drew criticism toward the end of his career with the Cowboys by 
insisting upon coaching the defense and also calling the plays on offense. Only 
recently, Landry fired old friend Ernie Stautner as defensive coordinator 
because the Cowboys were the second-worst team in the NFL in points allowed in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
While his fate was being decided Saturday, Landry spent the day playing golf. 
</P>
<P>
Landry spent Friday, his last day as a Dallas coach, watching film at Valley 
Ranch and getting ready for a team mini-camp Monday as he took on the challenge 
of getting the team back from its disastrous 3-13 season, the second-worst 
record in his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't want to leave the Cowboys when they were down," Landry said. "I 
at least wanted them to get into a respectable position before anyone else took 
over." 
</P>
<P>
But when the end came for Landry, he didn't get his final wish.

<P>
It ended just as it had 12 other times this century -- with a referee pulling a 
victorious American heavyweight champion off a battered, bleeding British 
challenger. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tyson drove Frank Bruno into the ropes with a vicious series of punches 
late in the fifth round Saturday night, and the courageous but outclassed Bruno 
was then rescued by referee Richard Steele, who stopped the fight with five 
seconds left in the round. 
</P>
<P>
Bruno had his moment, though. If only for a few seconds, he brought 2,000 
Englishmen in the packed 9,200-seat Las Vegas Hilton Center to their feet in a 
wild and memorable first round. 
</P>
<P>
More important, by lasting almost five rounds, Bruno proved a couple of things. 
First, he does not have a glass jaw; he took Tyson's best shots throughout the 
fight. Second, Tyson might not be the unbeatable colossus everyone thinks he 
is. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson was not sensational Saturday night, merely very good. 
</P>
<P>
He came out, as always, looking for the quick knockout. And for a few seconds 
it appeared as if he might break the all-time record for the fastest knockout 
in heavyweight title fight history, the 55-second KO James Jeffries pinned on 
Jack Finnegan in 1900. 
</P>
<P>
The champion, fighting for the first time since his first-round knockout of 
Michael Spinks last June 27, had Bruno on the deck almost before the timekeeper 
had put down his hammer to start the first round. 
</P>
<P>
In Tyson's corner, Bruno caught a short right hand on the jaw and went down. He 
took a standing-8 count from Steele and arose clear-headed. He promptly stung 
Tyson with a left hook. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, obviously in quest of a quicker victory than his 91-second knockout of 
Spinks, tore into Bruno. But after the knockdown, he appeared to revert to his 
old ways. 
</P>

He threw leaping left hooks and missed wildly, twice almost losing his feet. 
With one miss, he spun himself completely around on the ropes and wound up 
facing the spectators. At that instant, Bruno hit him on the back of the head, 
and Steele deducted a point for the foul. 
</P>
<P>
Then, late in the round, came Bruno's moment, a moment they'll be talking about 
in London pubs for a generation or so. 
</P>
<P>
He hit Tyson with a workmanlike right hand that for an instant immobilized the 
champion, then followed it with a left hook that caught Tyson squarely. The 
champion's knees buckled and he backed up. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Englishmen in the audience were roaring him on, Bruno could not 
follow up, and the round ended soon after. It was his last opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
After the fight, Tyson praised his challenger's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"It was harder than the punch (a right uppercut) that (Tony) Tucker got me 
with," he said, referring to a punch Tucker landed in 1987, when Tyson unified 
the heavyweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
Bruno's punch, and the fact that he took Tyson's best shots to the head and 
body for more than four rounds, may have taken at least a little of the glitter 
off Tyson's victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank tried hard and it wound up just as we thought it would, but I think 
Frank gave hope to a lot of heavyweights tonight -- that Mike Tyson is not the 
monster a lot of people think he is," said one British reporter, Ken Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, for parts of the second, third and fourth rounds Tyson reverted to the 
Mike Tyson of the 1984 Olympic team trials, when he was an out-of-control 
amateur, missing and losing his footing with wild, leaping left hooks. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the 6-foot 4-inch, 228-pound Bruno (32-3), he wasn't mobile 
or quick enough to take advantage of the numerous opportunities Tyson 
presented. 
</P>
<P>
Bruno was successful, however, at tying up Tyson when he missed with right 
hands, creating a Greco-Roman wrestling match for much of the time. He was also 
successful at holding the shorter (5-11) Tyson by the back of the neck in the 
clinches. One of Tyson's new cornermen, Aaron Snowell, chased Steele across the 
ring after the third round to complain. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Bruno was overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the fifth, Tyson landed a couple of short, hard uppercuts inside, and 
Bruno's nose began to bleed. Bruno landed punches twice to Tyson's ribs, but 
seconds later the countdown started. 
</P>
<P>
First came a thumping left hook to the jaw that sent Bruno into the ropes near 
Tyson's corner, and the champion was all over his challenger, measuring his 
helpless opponent and hitting him like a man chopping a tree with an ax. 
</P>
<P>
After Bruno had taken four or five powerful blows to the head, Steele stepped 
in at 2:55, just as Bruno's trainer, Terry Lawless, was coming through the 
ropes. 
</P>
<P>
At that, Tyson, on the march to Rocky Marciano and 49-0, improved to 36-0. 
</P>
<P>
At the chaotic postfight news conference, he indicated 50-0 could come sooner 
than anyone expects. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to fight every two months," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Don King, who is acting as Tyson's promoter and manager even though he has no 
legal standing with the champion (Bill Cayton has a contract to be Tyson's 
manager until 1992, but he and Tyson are suing each other), said Jose Ribalta 
of Brazil might be next. 
</P>
<P>
After his long layoff, the combat gave the champion a rush, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt great, hearing the people scream . . . and when they screamed for him 
(Bruno), it motivated me more," Tyson said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruno was given a noisy ovation when he entered the ring, most of it from the 
British fans. But for the first time, when Tyson came in, he heard scattered 
boos, and not all of them were from Englishmen. 
</P>
<P>
Of Bruno, Tyson, not meaning to be insulting, also said: "These guys who 
challenge me with their primitive skills are as good as dead." 
</P>
<P>
Was Tyson hurt by the layoff? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I was in good shape, but I should have started training earlier," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to make excuses, but I did have to take off 40 pounds. Yeah, that 
had a lot to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
"Bruno was very hot -- he came to fight. It's a hurting business (boxing). He 
hurt me, I hurt him. From the third round on, I knew I'd break him. I could 
feel him breaking." 
</P>
<P>
Tyson seemed a touch irritated at being asked, yet again, how he liked his new 
cornermen in the fight. Replacing fired head trainer Kevin Rooney and assistant 
Matt Baranski were Jay Bright, Snowell and cutman Taylor Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you something, when someone's throwing punches at you, it doesn't 
matter who's in your corner," Tyson answered. 
</P>
<P>
Of being rocked by Bruno in the first: "He hit me pretty hard, harder than 
Tucker." 
</P>
<P>
Tyson said he began Bruno's downfall in the fifth round with a left hook. 
</P>
<P>
"The punch that set it up was a left hook to the body, about 30 seconds before 
I got him on the ropes," he said. "He didn't come back after that punch to the 
body." 
</P>
<P>
Bruno, his dignity and popularity wholly intact, will return to England, where 
he'll no doubt sign for more television commercials and add to his six-figure 
endorsement income. He earned a gross of about $3.6 million Saturday night, 
Tyson about $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried my best," Bruno said, "But he beat me fair and square." 
</P>
<P>
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
On the undercard, two champions successfully defended their titles: WBC 
super-featherweight titlist Azumah Nelson of Ghana and WBA junior-middleweight 
champion Julian Jackson of the Virgin Islands. Nelson (30-1) stopped Mario 
Martinez (47-5-2) of Guadalajara, Mexico, in the 12th round. Jackson (35-1) put 
his outclassed opponent, Francisco DeJesus (25-3), on the deck in the second 
round and knocked him down for a full count in the eighth. Jackson has knocked 
out 33 of his 36 opponents. . . . James Douglas (28-4-2) of Columbus, Ohio, ran 
up a unanimous decision over former WBC heavyweight champion Trevor Berbick 
(35-7-1) in a dreary, 10-round matchup of fat, out-of-shape heavyweights.

JIM MURRAY: MAN FROM THE EMPIRE COULDN'T STRIKE BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't a fight, it was an atrocity. It was like watching a chainsaw murder. 
</P>
<P>
Some years ago, reporting on a baseball game that ended 22-6, the late Dick 
Young wrote: "This belongs on Page 3 with the rest of the ax murders." 
</P>
<P>
So does the Mike Tyson-Frank Bruno fight. It was several seconds old before 
Bruno was aground. 
</P>
<P>
That sound of breaking glass you heard about 7:35 Saturday night wasn't an 
earthquake. It was Frank Bruno's chin. Supposedly, some of the finest Spode 
china in the world rests just underneath Frank's mandible. 
</P>
<P>
He got up but he revised his fight plan considerably. He started out as if he 
were trying to win the fight. After the knockout, he was just trying to survive 
it. 
</P>
<P>
He ended up alive, thanks to a squeamish referee. But he did beat the price in 
a way: Vegas, which will post a line on the end of the world and cut itself in 
for a middle, had a proposition that would pay you 11-10 if Bruno lasted more 
than 4 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Well, he did -- barely. Bruno was gamer than the referee who seemed afraid he 
might find the Englishman's head rolling down the aisle if he didn't step in. 
He stopped the fight while Bruno still had one. 
</P>
<P>
The fight had its moments. The heavyweight champion of the world, a creature so 
fearsome you'd expect they'd call out the National Guard if it started up the 
Empire State Building or was seen swimming in Loch Ness, seemed to think he was 
on the driving range by the fifth. He was teeing off on Frank Bruno. It's 
likely Bruno would have gone down if he knew which way it was. By then, he was 
just the heavy bag to Tyson. He could have been hanging on chains. 
</P>
<P>
Bruno proved to have one fatal flaw: He couldn't move backwards. He couldn't 
move much of any way. Pigeons were circling him by midfight. He should be a 
statue in Trafalgar Square. 
</P>
<P>
To be unable to move -- and fast and preferably backward -- in the ring against 
Tyson is a drawback akin to being unable to swim in a shipwreck. 
</P>
<P>
Bruno seemed to figure as long as he couldn't beat Tyson, he would hug him to 
death. Tyson must have felt as if he spent the night in the grip of a lovesick 
octopus. 
</P>
<P>
It worked for awhile. The only trouble with hugging Mike Tyson is, you got to 
get close to him to do it. It's a good idea to keep an area code between you 
and Mike Tyson when he's looking for you with murder in his heart. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it wouldn't be fair to say the only thing Bruno hit all night was the 
floor. He actually hit Mike Tyson a time or two. That wasn't the smartest thing 
he ever did. Tyson gets annoyed when he gets hit. It's a little bit like 
tweaking a lion's tail. 
</P>
<P>
But the worst thing about hitting Mike Tyson is what happens then. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
It's like shooting spitballs at a battleship. It's like the old joke: If you 
ever hit Mike Tyson and he finds out about it -- look out. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Bruno probably thinks he can hit a little bit. After all, all but one of 
his 34 fights ended in a knockout -- 32 times he was the knocker-outer, and 
twice he was the knockee. Somebody is horizontal when Frank Bruno fights. 
</P>
<P>
So, Frank had some expectation Tyson might reel a little bit or maybe even 
blink when he threw his best punch. Tyson just ignored it. He fought Bruno as 
if he were chasing a chicken. 
</P>
<P>
So, the house got a push in Vegas. They won on the proposition the fight 
wouldn't go the distance, they lost on the proposition it wouldn't go 4 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
And it confounded the experts who said it wouldn't last much past the 
introductions. 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy to knock a man out. Particularly, a man who stands 6-3 and weighs 
228. Frank Bruno was no Michael Spinks. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tyson is now in the position Joe Louis was. You don't measure a man by how 
many rounds he lasts against him but how many minutes. If anyone goes the limit 
with him, he gets a ticker-tape parade. A guy in with Tyson feels lucky he 
didn't get eaten. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson was almost apologetic in his postfight interview. He seemed to feel he 
probably should have killed his opponent or at least put him in traction. 
</P>
<P>
"Can I tell you something?" Tyson said. "I could have used more training. But I 
had to deal with what I had." 
</P>
<P>
Did his weight loss -- he had to take off 40 pounds of French fries and pizza 
to get ready for this fight -- have an effect? "Oh, definitely, you know what I 
mean? But I had to deal with it." Was he hurt at any time? "It's a hurting 
business, but can I tell you something? It's not in my fight plan. I refuse to 
get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
In the end it was his very indestructibility that undid Bruno. Frank, anchored 
in the cement of his fighting style, could only stand there and watch like a 
guy seeing an avalanche coming down on his cabin. He couldn't run, he couldn't 
hide. Tyson didn't even give him time to pray. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson doesn't bleed. He doesn't lump. He has only one gear -- forward. He 
throws rocks. He's not the devastating one-punch knockout artist a Joe Louis 
was. He's a swarmer. But he's as unstoppable as a glacier. 
</P>
<P>
So, it's another setback for the Empire. But Bruno went down with flags flying 
and guns firing. You just can't stop a force of nature with ordinary weapons. 
Bullets would bounce off Mike Tyson. You might have to have a blunt stake and a 
crucifix to end his reign -- and catch him asleep in his coffin. It's for sure 
left hooks are a waste of time.

NHL ROUNDUP;

<P>
YZERMAN LEADS DETROIT PAST CHICAGO, 5-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In some circumstances, being rated third-best is not such a great achievement, 
but in the National Hockey League it's quite an accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
The player rated behind Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux is one to be respected. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Yzerman has earned the honor and he is leading the Detroit Red Wings to 
new respect in the Norris Division. 
</P>
<P>
Yzerman, on his way to shattering all the Red Wings' offensive records, had a 
short-handed goal and an assist Saturday at Detroit to lead the Red Wings to a 
5-0 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks, unbeaten in their previous five games had moved into second 
place and were getting into a position to challenge the Wings. Instead of 
pulling to within nine points, the Blackhawks fell to 13 points. With only 16 
games remaining, Detroit is in a good position. 
</P>
<P>
Already this season Yzerman, 24, has set club records for a season in goals and 
points. He needs three assists to break Marcel Dionne's record of 74. The goal 
was his 58th and he has 130 points. 
</P>
<P>
The center from British Columbia has received praise from one of the best, 
veteran center Bryan Trottier of the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not taking anything away from Wayne or Mario, but Steve has to be a strong 
candidate for MVP," Trottier said after one of Yzerman's dazzling performances. 
"He is having a tremendous season." 
</P>
<P>
All along Detroit Coach Jacques Demers has been praising Yzerman. 
</P>
<P>
"I know how Glen Sather (Edmonton coach) felt all those years coaching 
Gretzky," he said. "I feel the same way about Steve. He does everything for us. 
I don't know if he can get any better." 
</P>
<P>
Yzerman scored in the second period, 11 seconds after teammate Rick Zombo was 
sent off the ice for roughing. Detroit's Shawn Burr, 54 seconds after Yzerman 
scored, made it two short-handed goals on the same penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Glen Hanlon stopped 27 shots to earn the first shutout for the Wings this 
season. Hanlon has not given up a goal in more than 100 minutes. Before that, 
though, he gave up seven goals against Pittsburgh in two periods. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 5, Pittsburgh 5 -- If the Penguins don't win the 
hotly-contested Patrick Division, they can probably blame their last two fold 
ups. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday at Detroit, they built a 6-0 lead in the opening 26 minutes and had 
to settle for a tie. 
</P>
<P>
In this game at Uniondale, N.Y., they held a 5-2 lead with fewer than 14 
minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Lemieux's second goal of the game and 64th of the season had given the 
Penguins their big lead. 
</P>
<P>
David Volek began the rally for the Islanders, last-place team in the Patrick 
Division, when he scored his 21st at 6:37. At 11:08 Derek King cut the lead to 
a goal. There was only 2:03 left in regulation when Randy Wood scored to send 
it into overtime. The Islanders had the only two shots on goal in the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Coffey had four assists for the Penguins and has a club-record 86. Randy 
Carlyle set the mark in 1980-81 with 83. 
</P>
<P>
New York Rangers 7, Quebec 2 -- Darren Turcotte and Carey Wilson each scored 
twice at Quebec to boost the Rangers back into first place in the Patrick 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers have 72 points, Pittsburgh 71 and Washington 70. 
</P>
<P>
With their third victory in the last four games the Rangers appear to have 
ended their slump. 
</P>
<P>
Guy Lafleur, who played junior hockey in Quebec, assisted on both goals by the 
rookie Turcotte. It was his first appearance in Quebec since he came out of 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 9, Hartford 1 -- Back in good health, the Bruins are beginning to 
resemble the team that made it to the final round of the Stanley Cup last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
In this game at Hartford, Randy Burridge and Glen Wesley each scored twice as 
the Bruins, winning their fourth in a row, humiliated the Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
The Whalers enjoyed only the first 35 seconds when they took the lead on John 
Anderson's tip-in. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 6, Buffalo 1 -- The Canadiens seem to delight in knocking off teams 
that are going well. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres had won five in a row, but they were no match for the Adams Division 
leaders at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Stephane Richer and Russ Courtnall each scored twice to lead the Canadiens to 
an easy victory. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 5, St. Louis 3 -- Craig Simpson had a hat trick at Edmonton and the 
Oilers handed the slumping Blues their seventh consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
The third victory in a row enabled the Oilers to move ahead of the Kings into 
second place in the Smythe Division. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 4, Minnesota 2 -- Although they are next-to-last overall in the NHL, 
the Maple Leafs are making a bid to earn a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
With this victory at Bloomington, Minn., the Leafs are only three points behind 
the North Stars and St. Louis in the battle for the last playoff berth in the 
weak Norris Division. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Damphousse's goal with three minutes left in the second period broke a 
2-2 tie. DAN HAFNER

TITANS GO OUT AT HOME WITH A ROAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are certain privileges reserved for gloating fans in the final minutes of 
a blowout, and one of the most honored is calling for the subs. 
</P>
<P>
A chant went up from the Cal State Fullerton crowd in the waning minutes of the 
Titans' 71-56 dismissal of Fresno State Saturday. With 37 seconds left, it was 
at its loudest. 
</P>
<P>
But this one wasn't for the subs. The last player off the bench, Joe Neeley, a 
former manager now in uniform as a walk-on, was already in the game. 
</P>
<P>
They were calling for the coach, John Sneed, who has had the job only on an 
acting basis since George McQuarn resigned before the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We want Sneed, We want Sneed," chanted a good part of the crowd of 2,225 in 
Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, sticking fast to a decision made before the season to hold an open 
search, accepted applications until Friday -- Sneed's among them. The school 
plans to name a coach within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
On the sideline, Sneed kept his reaction invisible. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in the presence of Athletic Director Ed Carroll, he responded to 
questions with a subtle touch. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has their opinion," Sneed said. "I guess two or three voiced theirs." 
</P>
<P>
The celebratory mood in Titan Gym was the result of a thorough reversal of 
Fullerton's first game against Fresno State this season, a 21-point loss that 
Sneed called "a total embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
This time, on a night that marked the final home game of the season, the Titans 
did themselves proud, and had their fun along the way. They jumped to a 25-11 
lead early, let the Bulldogs back in it late in the half, and then pulled away 
finally with six minutes left in the game when Ceballos knocked down a 
three-pointer to give the Titans a 57-47 lead. It was never less than double 
digits again, and once was as large as 17. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, led by Ceballos' 28 points, Fullerton (14-11 overall, 9-7 in 
conference play) assured itself of a .500 season and at least a seventh-place 
finish in the Big West. With two more victories and the right breaks, the 
Titans could finish as high as tied for second. 
</P>
<P>
The evening began with the traditional senior recognition, punctuated by Derek 
Jones' emotional introduction. As the crowd gave him a standing ovation, Jones 
hugged not only most of his teammates and his own mother, but also each of the 
parents of the other seniors gathered at halfcourt. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a pretty affectionate guy," said Jones, who came back to play his senior 
season more than a year after being critically injured in a drive-by shooting. 
"These are the people who supported me in my time of sorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton won with a pressing defense that forced two 10-second violations and 
numerous turnovers, and an interior defense that helped contain Fresno's 
leading scorer, Jervis Cole, who scored 22 points but made only eight of 26 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't ready for their quickness," Fresno State Coach Ron Adams said. His 
Bulldogs are 12-13, 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton fun was at its height with 4 minutes left, when John Sykes, the 
Titans' 6-foot-8 center, came up with the ball and decided to lead the fast 
break himself, despite having point guard Wayne Williams on his left and 
Ceballos on his right. 
</P>
<P>
This was much to the delight of the crowd -- especially when Sykes finished the 
break with a between the legs bounce pass to Williams, who layed it in for a 
63-49 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd roared. On the sidelines, Sneed wiped his brow and shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"It topped the night off," said Sykes, long known for spirited but headstrong 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he feared Sneed's reaction, Sykes said, "Unh, uh. I'm a free spirit. I 
go with the motion." 
</P>
<P>
Sneed conceded that the play was a crowd pleaser. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't enjoy that," he said. "You tend to get a little out of control with a 
lead like that." 
</P>
<P>
All told, it was a night for the seniors -- Jones, Brent Calvin and Randal Moos 
-- all of whom started the game. And, it was a night for Sneed. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't exactly sure what the public wanted, or what they thought," Jones 
said. "He's done a spectacular job with us. It was nice to hear that they 
wanted him back next year." 
</P>
<P>
They wanted Jones back too. But for Jones, no cheers could do it.

NEW MEXICO STATE SHOOTS DOWN COLD UC IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Mulligan, UC Irvine's basketball coach, had borrowed from Georgetown's 
Charles Smith this week when he said a team must bring its defense to every 
game so it can win when the jumper isn't there. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, Irvine doesn't have that much defense, and when the shots 
aren't falling, the Anteaters are. For the second time in three days, Irvine's 
perimeter game fizzled, and even an inspired defense wasn't enough to overcome 
New Mexico State Saturday night before 2,855 in the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
With all its starters shooting 50% or better from the field, New Mexico State 
defeated UC Irvine, 72-69, in a Big West Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies, 18-8 overall and 11-5 in the Big West, played as if they were home, 
shooting 60% from the field. The Anteaters (11-14, 8-8) shot 43%. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine was fine when it penetrated the Aggies' aggressive matchup zone. Power 
forward Ricky Butler, who had a team-high 19 points, and center Mike Doktorczyk 
(17) were a combined 14 of 20 from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
But the Anteaters' outside shooters mostly misfired. Irvine sophomore Jeff 
Herdman, who had the country's best three-point field-goal percentage entering 
the week, missed all seven of his three-point shots and was one for 11 overall. 
Senior guard Kevin Floyd was two of 12 from the field and reserve guard Justin 
Anderson missed all four of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, ranked sixth in the country in team three-point field-goal percentage, 
made only four of 21 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine entered the season-ending four-game home stand with a chance to clinch 
second place in the Big West with a sweep. Instead, the Anteaters lost two in a 
row and are fighting for one of the top six spots in the standings, which would 
result in bye on the first day of the conference postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so high after winning five of six," Floyd said. "I wanted to get the 
broom out and sweep us into the tourney. Now, we're just fighting for 
survival." 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State is headed in the other direction. The Aggies became New Mexico 
State's only team to have a winning conference record on the road -- 5-4 -- and 
are in sole possession of second place in the Big West after having won nine of 
11. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense was really good tonight and we made the plays we had to make to 
win," Aggie Coach Neil McCarthy said. "The game was played at a very high level 
of intensity." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Anteaters had a chance to win. They trailed by one, 67-66, on 
Doktorczyk's two free throws with 50 seconds left. But the Aggies easily 
handled Irvine's fullcourt press. Willie Joseph scored on a flying slam and 
then Johnny Roberson made a layin to put New Mexico up, 71-66, with :25 left.

THREE-POINTER BY LSU'S BLANTON SINKS 18TH-RANKED UNLV, 88-87

<P>
The play was designed for Chris Jackson, but Ricky Blanton wound up with the 
ball and hit the game-winning shot Saturday in Louisiana State's 88-87 victory 
over 18th-ranked Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Blanton's three-pointer from the right baseline came with four seconds left in 
the nationally televised game, after UNLV's Greg Anthony missed a free throw 
and Wayne Sims got the rebound for LSU. 
</P>
<P>
Sims' pass to Jackson almost went out of bounds, but the freshman guard made an 
acrobatic save and got the ball back to Sims, who threw it to Lyle Mouton. 
Mouton looked for Jackson, who finished with 29 points, but instead found 
Blanton, who had 18. 
</P>
<P>
"He was like Captain Marvel -- Shazam!" LSU Coach Dale Brown said of Jackson's 
save. "I don't know how he saved it, but he did." 
</P>
<P>
UNLV (20-7) took an 84-83 lead with 1:12 left, on an eight-foot jumper by 
Anthony, and increased its lead to 86-83 when Anthony hit another jumper with 
33 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson then sank a jumper from just inside the three-point line to bring LSU 
(20-8) to within 86-85. 
</P>
<P>
With 15 seconds to play, Anthony missed the second shot of a one-and-one. That 
set up the winning play.

KARPUN GETS 29TH GOAL AS DALLAS BEATS LAZERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Karpun scored his 29th goal of the season, and Eloy Salgado assisted on 
Dallas' first three goals as the short-handed Sidekicks beat the Los Angeles 
Lazers, 4-3, Saturday night at the Forum. The Sidekicks, missing five regulars, 
won for the fourth time in five games against the Lazers. 
</P>
<P>
The Lazers pulled within 3-2 on Ben Collins' goal at 12:35 of the third period, 
only to have Jorge Acosta give Dallas another two-goal lead at 1:53 of the 
fourth.

USF WINS AGAIN, THIS TIME BEATING LOYOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The University of San Francisco has been the mystery team of the West Coast 
Athletic Conference this season, but Saturday night everyone knew whodunit. 
</P>
<P>
USF left no doubt as a couple of big Macs, mercurial senior Mark McCathrion and 
lightly regarded sophomore Mark McWhorter, lead the Dons to a 123-109 upset 
victory over Loyola Marymount before 5,220 fans at USF. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave USF a sweep of Loyola and Pepperdine this weekend. The Dons 
defeated conference champion St. Mary's earlier this month, making them the 
only WCAC team to beat the top three finishers. 
</P>
<P>
With the loss, Loyola (17-10 overall) finished tied with Pepperdine for second 
at 10-4, while USF (16-11) clinched fourth place at 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Conference tie-breakers make Loyola the third-place team going into next 
weekend's WCAC tournament at USF. Loyola will open against sixth-place Gonzaga, 
while USF will face Bay Area rival Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
The question now is which USF team will show -- the one that defeated the top 
three WCAC teams as well as Notre Dame, or the one that lost to last-place San 
Diego and was beaten by 38 points at home by Santa Clara? 
</P>
<P>
"When people were saying we were inconsistent, I said our goal was to peak at 
the end of the season," Dons Coach Jim Brovelli said. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-8 McCathrion, who sometimes led the break, finished with 35 points, 
17 rebounds and 9 assists -- all career highs. 
</P>
<P>
McWhorter, a 7-point-per-game scorer, was often on the end of McCathrion's 
passes, getting 34 points, 25 in the second half, on 13-of-15 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
For Loyola, Hank Gathers had 34 points and 12 rebounds and Enoch Simmons added 
26 points. 
</P>
<P>
The game turned in a four-minute stretch midway through the second half, when 
the Dons cut Loyola's lead to 76-71, then went on a 19-8 run to build a lead 
the never relinquished. Loyola pulled to within 94-92 with 7:11 left but went 
down in a flurry of USF two-on-ones and breakaways. 
</P>
<P>
"We were pressing and trapping pretty well but we didn't get the turnovers," 
Lion Coach Paul Westhead said. "Instead of getting steals they were converted 
into baskets." 
</P>
<P>
USF shot 72.5% in the second half by beating Loyola's press. 
</P>
<P>
McCathrion, who scored six points when USF lost at Loyola in January, said, "In 
the open court it's fun -- get it and go. I wish every team in the league 
played like that." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola seemed on the verge of pulling away several times in the first half, 
building several double figure leads as Gathers scored 19 and Simmons added 16. 
</P>
<P>
But USF hung tough, pulling to within a point at 28-27 and never allowing the 
Lions to put together an explosive run. 
</P>
<P>
McCathrion and Joel DeBortoli scored 17 apiece, with DeBortoli spinning in a 
layup at the buzzer for the halftime score of 59-51. DeBortoli finished with 28 
points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Will USF, playing on its own floor, be the sleeper of the WCAC tournament? "I 
don't think anyone ever doubted they were a good team," Westhead said. "I'm 
sure it doesn't hurt them winning two in a row like this."

RAVELING'S OPTIMISM UNFOUNDED AS USC FALLS; 
</P>
<P>
TROJANS MAKE 21 TURNOVERS WHILE LOSING TO HUSKIES, 74-68, AT SPORTS ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
George Raveling, USC's basketball coach, was confident entering Saturday's game 
against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was ever a game that we played this year that I would have bet 
big-time money that we'd win, it was today," Raveling said. "I just felt it in 
my bones." 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans, however, played poorly in a 74-68 loss to the Huskies before 2,037 
fans at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a total shock to me that we played the way we played," Raveling 
said. "I honestly and truly believe that we beat ourselves in this game more 
than Washington beat us. 
</P>
<P>
"This loss was not as frustrating as it was disappointing. Maybe I was 
overconfident coming in, but I thought the atmosphere was right for us to win. 
I never in my life thought we'd play the way we played. I thought it was beyond 
us." 
</P>
<P>
USC made careless mistakes. The Trojans had 21 turnovers, including a 
season-high 15 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans had four turnovers in the first five minutes, and Raveling's 
pregame optimism dimmed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why we turned the ball over," Raveling said. "A lot of them were 
just foolish turnovers. A lot of times, the guy with the ball wasn't even being 
pressured." 
</P>
<P>
Andy Russo, Washington's coach, thought the Huskies' pressure defense was 
disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to our game today was defense," Russo said. "We were aggressive and we 
got up on the ball." 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies had been struggling on offense, but guard Eldridge Recasner shot 
Washington out of its slump. 
</P>
<P>
Recasner, who scored 21 points, had the best shooting day of his career, making 
all eight of his shots, including three three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Recasner was frustrated because the Huskies, who led by as many as 18 points, 
had difficulty putting USC away. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just a better team than they are," Recasner said. "I don't think at any 
point in the game I felt we were going to lose. I was kind of frustrated the 
whole game because I felt we should have taken them out of the game in the 
first half." 
</P>
<P>
Center Mark West scored 16 points, and forward Mike Hayward had 14. 
</P>
<P>
After being benched last weekend in games against Oregon State and Oregon, 
which ended his string of 51 consecutive starts, Hayward regained his starting 
spot and played well. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of the way Hayward played after having a tough time last week," 
Russo said. 
</P>
<P>
USC, which trailed by 18 points with 10:36 remaining, managed to make a game 
out of it. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 59-41, USC outscored Washington, 21-6, in 9:13 to cut the deficit to 
65-62 with 1:23 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to credit our kids," Raveling said. "They were in a position to win 
at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Coleman, who scored 24 points and had 10 rebounds, and Anthony Pendleton 
(14 points) played key roles in USC's rally. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman had four points in the USC rally, and Pendleton, who had been benched 
for not playing good defense, scored nine points after coming off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"Pendleton can really shoot it," Russo said. "We tried to deny him the ball 
until he was out of his range, whatever that is. 
</P>
<P>
"USC is an amazing team. When you've gone through the type of season they've 
had and you get down by 16 or 17 and still keep coming back, you have to give 
them a lot of credit. It's easy to play when things are going good, but not 
when things are going bad. My hat goes off to them." 
</P>
<P>
Washington held off the Trojans in the end by hitting 9 of 10 free throws. West 
made four free throws in the last 30 seconds to secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
USC is 9-19 overall and 2-14 in the Pacific 10 Conference. Washington is 11-15 
and 7-10. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
USC guard Rich Grande bruised his upper chest in a collision with Washington 
forward Mike Hayward with 10 minutes left in the second half. Grande will be 
X-rayed today. A senior, Grande is on the verge of becoming one of the few 
players in USC history to play on four consecutive last place teams. "It's 
frustrating," Grande said. "It's not a happy feeling saying you finished last 
every year you played in the USC program. But I'm really proud to say that I've 
been on the team and to be a part of the tradition here." 
</P>
<P>
Washington forward Dion Brown, a sophomore who played at Crenshaw High, was 
replaced in Huskies starting lineup by Anthony Jenkins.

Howard Wright scored 21 points and freshman Adam Keefe made two of four free 
throws in the final 48 seconds Saturday as 16th-ranked Stanford edged Oregon 
State, 60-58. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford (23-5 overall, 14-3 in the Pacific 10 Conference) took a 58-56 lead on 
Wright's basket with 1:30 to go. 
</P>
<P>
But Oregon State's Gary Payton sank a pair of free throws with 58 seconds 
remaining to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
Keefe hit one of two free throws with 48 seconds left to make it 59-58. The 
Beavers, who dropped to 19-6 and 11-5, called a timeout with 41 seconds left 
and worked for the final shot. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Knox, surrounded by Stanford defenders, missed a 10-foot bank shot with 10 
seconds to go. The ball bounced to Payton, but his 16-foot jumper also missed. 
</P>
<P>
Keefe grabbed the rebound with one second to go, was fouled and made one of two 
free throws for the final margin. 
</P>
<P>
The intense contest included a shoving match between Payton and Stanford's Eric 
Reveno in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers hit just 36% of their shots, compared to 49% for Stanford. Payton 
was 6 for 20 but still led the Beavers with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Lichti was 6 for 18, scoring 14 points. Reveno contributed 15 for the 
Cardinal.

BELLO HORIZONTE SURPRISES IN ARCADIA HANDICAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a serendipitous event Saturday at Santa Anita when a trainer thought her 
horse had been beaten by a head but it won by a nose. 
</P>
<P>
Bello Horizonte, running for only the fourth time in 14 months, closed from the 
outside to nip another closer, Sarhoob, by a nostril. The improbable finish to 
the $100,000 Arcadia Handicap surprised most of the principals as well as the 
32,480 fans. 
</P>
<P>
Until the photograph of the finish was posted, many of those in the crowd were 
shouting epithets at the television monitors even after they had a second 
chance to watch the footage of the mile grass race. 
</P>
<P>
"Surprised me," somebody said to Eddie Delahoussaye, the jockey aboard Bello 
Horizonte, as he walked off the track. 
</P>
<P>
"Me, too," Delahoussaye said, "but I'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
Sally Lundy, an assistant trainer for her husband, Dick, who is with 10 of 
owner Allen Paulson's horses in Florida, seemed to jump about as high as Bello 
Horizonte's withers when the 6-year-old Irish-bred's number was posted on the 
tote board. Bello Horizonte, with a history of knee problems, ran only twice 
last year and was making his second start this year. The Arcadia was two days 
short of the second anniversary of his last victory and was only his fourth in 
22 lifetime starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we got beat by a head," Sally Lundy said. "But then by the time I 
got down to the track, and they still hadn't put the numbers up, I thought 
maybe it was a little closer. I was excited. I was happy for the horse." 
</P>
<P>
Sarhoob, ridden by Chris McCarron and making his first start since an 
eighth-place finish in the Breeders' Cup Turf at Churchill Downs in his 
American debut on Nov. 5, was three-quarters of a length ahead of Patchy 
Groundfog in the seven-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
Patchy Groundfog, who ran as an entry with Ofanto, led the pack until Bello 
Horizonte and Sarhoob charged from the outside in the last sixteenth of a mile. 
</P>
<P>
Bello Horizonte, assigned 113 pounds but carrying 116 because Delahoussaye 
couldn't make the weight, paid $20.60, $7.80 and $3. Sarhoob, the French 
import, was the high weight of 120 pounds and paid $5.20 and $3. Patchy 
Groundfog, who with his stablemate went off the 9-5 favorite, paid $2.40. 
Ofanto finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Bello Horizonte was timed in 1:36 1/5, two seconds off the track record, and 
earned $64,700. In his last start, at the same distance, he finished third but 
had none of the stretch speed he showed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Chris won," Delahoussaye said. "My horse bobbed his head at the 
right spot. The slow pace hurt him the other day in his last race." 
</P>
<P>
McCarron said he was riding with his head down and couldn't tell who won. 
Charlie Whittingham, who took over the training of Sarhoob from his French 
conditioner, Andre Fabre, after the Breeders' Cup, was surprised at the result, 
as were his assistants. Dick Lundy used to work for Whittingham, before he 
moved to New York and then returned to California last year to become Paulson's 
head trainer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
When the field made the turn for home, Sarhoob was ahead of only one horse -- 
Bello Horizonte, who was nine lengths behind the leader, Ron Bon, going down 
the backstretch. Ron Bon stopped running at the eighth pole and finished last. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Bello Horizonte was scheduled to be sold at auction at Hollywood 
Park. But Dick Lundy thought the horse's knees were all right and withdrew him 
from the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Lundy ran second Saturday with Savannah's Honor, who was beaten by Colonial 
Waters in the $200,000 Johnnie Walker Black Classic at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
Bello Horizonte was next scheduled to run in the March 11 $75,000 San Marino 
Handicap, for horses who haven't won $35,000 or more going a mile or farther. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to do some rethinking," Sally Lundy said. "He's not eligible for 
that now." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Music Merci, who won three stakes as a 2-year-old, including the Del Mar 
Futurity, will be favored today in the San Rafael Stakes, which has drawn just 
four other starters. . . . Houston, who is arguably the best 3-year-old in 
California, worked five furlongs in 1:01 Friday at Santa Anita. Undefeated in 
his only two starts, he is about two weeks away from a race. . . . Although Is 
It True, the winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last year, is also working 
again, it is beginning to look as though he won't make the Kentucky Derby. He 
underwent knee surgery after the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The weights for next Sunday's $1-million Santa Anita Handicap are due today, 
with trainer Eddie Gregson guessing that his Super Diamond will get 122 pounds, 
two less than Nasr el Arab. . . . Super Diamond worked six furlongs Saturday in 
1:13 1/5. . . . Nine other horses may run -- Payant, Frankly Perfect, Good 
Taste, Stalwars, Cherokee Colony, Perceive Arrogance, Triteamtri, Stylish 
Winner and Martial Law. The owners of Nasr el Arab and Martial Law, who hadn't 
nominated their horses, are paying a $25,000 penalty per horse to run.

Coach Steve Keith, who led Glendale High to two titles before leaving the 
school last season, masterminded another trip to a Southern Section boys' 
basketball championship as Irvine shocked top-seeded Pasadena, 67-60, in the 
5-A division semifinals Saturday night before 1,800 fans at Christ College of 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (24-5) will meet South Coast League rival Capistrano Valley (23-4) in 
the championship game at 6:15 p.m. Saturday at the Sports Arena. Capistrano 
Valley defeated Irvine twice in league play, but Keith isn't discounting his 
team's chances. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're good enough to get there (the championship game), you're good enough 
to win," Keith said. "You're so happy to be there, you don't care if it's the 
Lakers you're playing." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine advanced to its first championship game by making 10 of 13 free throws 
in the final quarter and getting a critical 12-foot jump shot from sophomore 
John Molle with 1:06 remaining to push Irvine ahead, 62-58. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine made six free throws in the final 38 seconds to snap Pasadena's 15-game 
win streak. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena (23-3) had won 19 games by 10 or more points, but the Bulldogs wilted 
down the stretch with Steve Dunmeyer dogging guard Idris Jones, who led 
Pasadena with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
Jones failed to get a field goal in the last quarter as Pasadena made only 2 of 
10 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine guard Bryan Allred scored nine of his game-high 22 points in the fourth 
quarter.

NEWSWIRE: IRISH LINEBACKER STONEBREAKER INJURED IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Stonebreaker, a junior All-American linebacker for national champion 
Notre Dame, was injured early Saturday when his car struck a utility pole near 
the South Bend, Ind., campus. 
</P>
<P>
Ursula M. Garzia, of Foxboro, Mass., a passenger in the car, was listed in 
serious condition with internal injuries at Memorial Hospital. She is a student 
at St. Mary's, a women's college located near Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Stonebreaker, who underwent surgery for a broken right kneecap and was treated 
for a dislocated right hip, is listed in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
Cpl. Larry Miller of the Roseland Police Department said tests showed 
Stonebreaker had a blood-alcohol level of .157% immediately after the accident. 
In Indiana, the legal level for intoxication is .10%. No charges have been 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
A Notre Dame spokesman said the couple attended a campus dance Friday night, 
and Stonebreaker told university officials they stopped at a restaurant just 
before the 2:30 a.m. accident.

Lisa Leslie scored 36 points and grabbed 18 rebounds to lead top-seeded 
Morningside High School to a 73-56 victory over Fountain Valley in a Southern 
Section 5-AA semifinal girls' basketball game Saturday at Edison High School. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie, a 6-foot-5 junior center, scored eight of her points in the second 
quarter as Morningside (27-1) overcame a 15-12 Fountain Valley lead. 
Morningside, ranked third in the nation by USA Today, outscored the Barons, 
23-6, in the second quarter to take a 35-21 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs, who scored 14 unanswered points in the first 4 minutes 42 seconds 
of the period, held Fountain Valley (21-9) to two free throws each by Stacey 
Hisaka, Amy Brand and Julie Workman in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie, who also had four blocks in the game, finished the first half with 15 
points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real pleased with the way we played in the first quarter," said Fountain 
Valley Coach Carol Strausburg, whose team led by as many as five points three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"They came out in a zone defense, and we shot very well against them. Then they 
came out of that defense in the second quarter, and we were very intimidated by 
their pressure. I wish we could have handled their defense a little better in 
the second quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Said Morningside Coach Frank Scott, whose team will play Fontana in the finals 
on Friday: "We tested them with a 2-3 zone to see what they could do. Then we 
went into a 1-2-2 defense in the second quarter, and that worked very well for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie added 12 more points in the third quarter as the Monarchs outscored the 
Barons, 23-17, to take a 58-38 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside's Jo Jo Witherspoon had 13 points, and 6-3 freshman forward Janet 
Davis scored six of her 10 points in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Hisaka and Kami Bigler had 17 points each to lead Fountain Valley, and Julie 
Workman added 10.

AMOROSO DELIVERS, CARRIES VALENCIA IN SEMIFINAL, 51-48 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Valencia High School, the team that wouldn't go away, got a little luck late in 
the game to go with its game-long perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
And it was enough to help Valencia beat Mission Viejo, 51-48, in a Southern 
Section 4-AA girls' semifinal game Saturday at El Toro High. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Amoroso made three of four free throws with 1 second left to give 
Valencia the victory and put the Tigers in the championship game against Canyon 
Thursday at Chapman College. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia, which was unseeded in the division, is 19-9. Mission Viejo, which 
finished its season 23-5, was the top-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, who shot poorly and had trouble guarding Jennifer Rohrig, Mission 
Viejo's 6-foot-2 center, trailed by as many as five points late in the game. 
But Valencia never gave up and hustled its way back into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia made one last, late run at Mission Viejo and tied the score, 48-48, on 
two free throws by guard Hsin-Yi Lo with 14 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo then called timeout, its last, in order to set up a play. 
</P>
<P>
Tina Ranker, Mission Viejo guard, drove toward the basket, but found her path 
blocked by Valencia players. She tried to throw a pass toward the corner of the 
key, but Amoroso intercepted it with 1 second left. 
</P>
<P>
And as she did, she was fouled by Mission Viejo's Derrie Nauta, who was running 
full tilt toward the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo called timeout, trying to freeze Amoroso, but because it had used 
all its timeouts was given a two-shot technical foul. So Amoroso had, in 
effect, at least three chances to win it for Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been in that position before," Amoroso said. "I was shaking." 
</P>
<P>
She made the front end of the one-and-one, hit the second and then sank one of 
two technical foul shots to give Valencia its winning margin. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter who would have won the game, it would have come down to something 
lucky at the end," Valencia Coach Debi Woelke said. 
</P>
<P>
It was hardly the best of games for either team, but particularly for Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Center Kristen McDonald, who averages 19 points a game, didn't score until 
there were 5 seconds left in the first half and finished with just 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Tigers scored only six points in the third quarter and had 
only one field goal in scoring 10 points in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Candy Andersen added 12 points, including eight in the fourth quarter, for 
Valencia. Lo and Amoroso had 10 and nine points, respectively.

IRVINE PUTS FINISHING TOUCHES ON TOP-SEEDED PASADENA, 67-60

Steve Dunmeyer got defensive, John Molle made the big shot and Bryan Allred 
took control down the stretch Saturday night. All of which added up to an 
Irvine High School upset that put Coach Steve Keith in another Southern Section 
boys' championship basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
Keith, who led Glendale to two titles before moving to Irvine last season, has 
masterminded another trip to the finals. Irvine defeated top-seeded Pasadena, 
67-60, in the 5-A semifinals before a capacity crowd of 1,800 at Christ College 
in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (24-5) will meet league rival Capistrano Valley (23-4) in the 
championship game at 6:15 p.m. Saturday in the Los Angeles Sports Arena. 
Capistrano Valley defeated Irvine twice in league play, but Keith isn't 
discounting his chances in the third meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're good enough to get there (championship game), you're good enough to 
win," Keith said. "You're so damn happy to be there, you don't care if it's the 
Lakers you're playing." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine qualified for its first title appearance by making 10 of 13 free throws 
in the final quarter and getting a critical jump shot from Molle with the game 
on the line. Molle, a sophomore, hit a 12-footer with 1:06 remaining to push 
Irvine ahead, 62-58. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine claimed the upset by making six free throws in the final 38 seconds, 
ending Pasadena's 15-game winning streak in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena (23-3) had won 19 games by 10 or more points, but the Bulldogs wilted 
down the stretch with Dunmeyer dogging guard Idris Jones. Jones led Pasadena 
with 18 points, but he failed to make a field goal in the last quarter as 
Pasadena made only two of 10 shots. 
</P>
<P>
The final quarter belonged to Allred, Irvine's often overlooked but seldom 
outplayed guard. Allred scored nine of his game-high 22 points in the last 
quarter and had four three-point shots in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"He took charge in the fourth quarter. . . . He wanted the ball," Keith said. 
"You really can't focus on one play in this game, but that shot by John Molle 
was a big play." 
</P>
<P>
Allred made eight of 13 shots, sometimes driving the lane for high-percentage 
shots or dishing off to a teammate. Long-range shooting or penetration was his 
game. Afterward, Allred said he looked forward to the challenge of facing 
Capistrano Valley again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited," he said. "If I could pick anybody to play for the championship, 
it would be Capistrano Valley. I knew all along we were a good team, so no, I'm 
not surprised we're in the final." 
</P>
<P>
For Pasadena Coach Bill Duwe, it marked the 10th time he has lost to a team 
coached by Keith in 11 games going back to Keith's days at Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
"Give Irvine the credit, they outplayed us," Duwe said. "They shot the lights 
out. I thought the two quick fouls that Don Mitchell got in the first quarter 
really hurt us. Fouls took us out of the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who has averaged 18 points in the playoffs, scored only three points 
before fouling out midway through the fourth quarter. Pasadena made 25 of 49 
shots, but Irvine was better, hitting 22 of 42 field goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve Tom Bulone played a big supporting role for Irvine. Bulone scored seven 
points, including two free throws with 4:13 remaining that gave Irvine a 56-50 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom has been a big plus in the past three or four games coming off the bench," 
Keith said. "When games have been close, we've been real good at making the big 
plays all year. Pasadena hasn't been in many close games this season, and that 
was to our advantage."

LADY MONARCHS OUST MOORPARK, SECURE BERTH IN JUNIOR COLLEGE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL OLSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Yogi Berra might have said, "It was like deja vu all over again." When the 
women's basketball teams from Moorpark and Valley colleges got together for 
Saturday's Southern California regional junior college playoff game at Valley, 
there was a strange feeling that they both had been through this before. 
</P>
<P>
Introductions, certainly, were not necessary. The teams knew each other well as 
they both hail from the Western State Conference. And they were already 
champions in their own right -- Valley in the Southern Division of the WSC and 
Moorpark in the Northern Division. 
</P>
<P>
But at the end it was courageous Valley that had rebounded from an 11-point 
deficit to claim a 64-54 victory, the Lady Monarchs' 13th win in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Valley (29-3) advances to the state tournament, where it will play San Mateo on 
Thursday. The field comprises four teams each from the Northern and Southern 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (23-8) trailed, 28-21, with five minutes left in the first half, but, 
after a timeout, the Lady Raiders went on a 12-2 run and took a 33-30 halftime 
lead on a three-point basket by Cindy Wiley with 14 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark was still on fire at the start of the second half, hitting four quick 
baskets to take a 41-30 lead with 17:13 to play. Valley, looking frustrated and 
deflated emotionally, found one way to slow its tormentor: The Lady Monarchs 
called a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
And when play resumed, Valley found another way, reeling off a 13-2 run to 
force a 43-43 tie with 7:38 to go. 
</P>
<P>
"We got down by 11 and the girls looked at the scoreboard during the timeout -- 
we got shocked and saw the season crumbling in front of us," Valley Coach Doug 
Michelson said. "They just had a lot of heart and started concentrating on what 
they were doing." 
</P>
<P>
The lead seesawed back and forth until Valley put on another surge in the final 
four minutes. Tisa Rush scored seven points and Ruth Aguilar added six to pave 
the way for the Lady Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of heart in the last few minutes," Aguilar said. "It was a great 
team effort. It came from the heart -- it had nothing to do with physical skill 
at the end."

UC IRVINE'S BAY BOMNBERS; 
</P>
<P>
. . .AND MIKE DOKTORCZYK OF MARY STAR SCORES OUTSIDE IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There's a big black-and-blue bruise on the inside of Mike Doktorczyk's right 
thigh, and one look at it will tell you that Doktorczyk, UC Irvine's center, 
would probably prefer almost anything on the basketball court to banging around 
underneath the basket for rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Doktorczyk has the mentality of a 6-foot shooting guard locked inside the body 
of a 6-9 post player. 
</P>
<P>
Most basketball stat lovers across the country would probably be surprised to 
find out that the cryptic M. Doktorczyk, Cal-Irvine -- who has been listed in 
the top five in the nation in 3-point field goal percentage most of this season 
-- is actually a hulking, backboard-crashing center, and not the speedy little 
sharpshooter they might have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan, however, isn't surprised by Doktorczyk's 3-point 
accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
"Most 6-9 guys think they're outside guys and they're really not," Mulligan 
said. "Mike is a legitimate outside player." 
</P>
<P>
Which leads to the other side of Doktorczyk's game -- the one inside the paint, 
where, coincidentally, the senior center caught the nasty thigh bruise Feb. 2 
against Cal State Fullerton that has kept him out of practice since. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll always be more comfortable playing outside, facing the basket," 
said Doktorczyk, a 1984 graduate of Mary Star of the Sea High School. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Doktorczyk doesn't have much choice where he plays. He's Irvine's 
tallest player, so he's the center. And it's a position he can play. With a new 
emphasis on Irvine's inside game, Doktorczyk is bearing much of the Anteaters' 
scoring burden with a team-high average of 15.9 points per game. He's also 
leading Irvine in rebounding with eight per game. 
</P>
<P>
Those aren't bad numbers for a player who, at the beginning of the season, 
wasn't even expected to start. 
</P>
<P>
It took a sweeping change in Doktorczyk's confidence level to earn the starting 
spot from Mulligan, who had lost faith in Doktorczyk after a disastrous game in 
Fresno State's Selland Arena two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine was ahead by a point in the waning minutes when Doktorczyk, a sophomore 
starter, threw away an inbounds pass. On the Anteaters' next trip down court, 
Doktorczyk tried to make amends and forced a shot that missed badly. Fresno 
recovered to win the game, and afterwards Mulligan, who had never won a game in 
Selland Arena, screamed at Doktorczyk for 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"He came down really hard on me, but I should have been able to take it," 
Doktorczyk said. "Mulligan wants to see how tough you are, but you've got to be 
mentally tough to take his verbal attacks. I took it personally and lost my 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
After that, Doktorczyk's playing time faded with his self-esteem. As a reserve 
the next year, he saw his average drop from seven points per game to five, and 
he shot only 38% from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real hesitant," Doktorczyk said. "I thought that if I missed one shot, I 
was gonna come out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Doktorczyk did a lot of soul searching. "I had to tell myself I 
could play again," he said. "First I had to prove it to myself. What are you 
gonna do sitting on the bench your senior year? That would have been a tough 
pill to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of sulking, Doktorczyk hit the weights and bulked up 30 pounds to 235. 
He fine-tuned his moves inside the key in a summer league against top college 
players. 
</P>
<P>
When the season began, Doktorczyk was ready. In the Anteaters' preseason 
exhibition against the Czech national team, Doktorczyk pulled up from 25 feet 
and buried a 3-pointer in the opening minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Mulligan said, 'That's no good,' as soon as I released that shot," Doktorczyk 
said. "He didn't believe I could do it. But I proved it to him." 
</P>
<P>
Doktorczyk scored 11 points in five minutes against the Czechs, and his playing 
time swelled after that. He did well in limited time in Irvine's opener against 
Georgia State, then started the next game against Texas Christian and grabbed 
nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"After I proved myself, I knew they were gonna depend on me," Doktorczyk said, 
"whereas last year I didn't feel that way." 
</P>
<P>
The center played a central role in the Anteaters' upset of UCLA in December, 
when he scored 18 points and pulled down eight rebounds. He followed that up 
with a 23-point performance in a 95-79 loss at UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Doktorczyk's high-water mark came Jan. 21, when he scored a career-high 28 
points against University of the Pacific. He made all 12 shots he took from the 
field, including four three-pointers, until Pacific shut him down in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
"You only have that feeling so many times in life," Doktorczyk said. "It was 
just turn and shoot." 
</P>
<P>
Or pull up and shoot. Doktorczyk likes to trail Irvine's fast break and cut 
loose from several feet behind the 3-point stripe -- a shot he feels is well 
within his range. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I can shoot it from there," he said. "When you're coming down the floor 
with confidence, you feel you can make it every time." 
</P>
<P>
Few would dispute that. Doktorczyk was the leading 3-point shooter in the 
nation for much of this year, and only recently relinquished the top spot to 
teammate Jeff Herdman. He has currently made 58% of his 3-pointers (37 of 64). 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Doktorczyk has had to get used to playing in pain. He got the thigh 
bruise when he drove into the key and met the knee of Fullerton's Cedric 
Ceballos. 
</P>
<P>
He suffered a severe quadriceps contusion, and the more he plays on it, the 
worse it gets. The bruise has since spread from his thigh to his knee, and the 
only thing that will heal it is rest -- which Mulligan can't afford to give him 
now. 
</P>
<P>
The injury didn't keep Doktorczyk from earning Big West Player of the Week 
honors Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a tough guy, and he's our best player right now," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Doktorczyk graduated with a bachelor's degree in social ecology from Irvine 
last year. He was a conference scholar-athlete last season and is enrolled in 
Irvine's graduate school of management. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I hope I don't get (the graduate degree) for a while," Doktorczyk 
said. "I'd like to play in Europe or somewhere first."

UC IRVINE'S BAY BOMBERS; 
</P>
<P>
KEVIN FLOYD OF WESTCHESTER IS IN-AND-OUT EXCITEMENT. . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Basketball, the way Kevin Floyd plays it, has the pace of a freight train ready 
to derail. If he had his way, the game would be a full-throttle, 94-foot 
demolition derby ending with a slam dunk. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd has more twists and turns than the Tasmanian Devil. And he draws a horde 
of player-control violations. But Floyd is one of the most electrifying college 
players on the West Coast, and without him, UC Irvine would be missing a lot of 
creativity and excitement. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd can get carried away at times. Just ask his coach, Bill Mulligan, who has 
referred not so affectionately to Floyd -- a former Westchester High School 
star -- as "Mr. Turnover." 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan concedes, however, that when the game is on the line, he wants the 
ball in the hands of No. 32. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't always want him under control," Mulligan said. "Most of the time, I 
want him almost out of control. The important thing is the decision he makes at 
the end of being out of control." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd's midair decisions have provided plenty of late-minute heroics this 
season. Just about as many have ended with offensive fouls. But when Floyd 
isn't giving away a charge, he's usually taking charge. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd's game-winning basket Dec. 28 against UCLA at Irvine's Bren Events Center 
was one example. Bruin point guard Pooh Richardson had just given his team a 
one-point lead with seconds remaining. Mulligan called a timeout and told Floyd 
to run the basketball up the gut of UCLA's defense. He instructed Floyd to kick 
the ball out to teammates Rod Palmer or Jeff Herdman if the Bruins smothered 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'Five seconds is an eternity,' " Mulligan said. "He could run all 
the way up the court and back in that amount of time, with his speed." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine inbounded, and all five UCLA defenders took a stab at Floyd. But the 
thought of passing the ball was just a passing fancy to him. 
</P>
<P>
His sortie through the Bruin defense was a one-man Charge of the Light Brigade. 
Floyd, airborne, punctuated the drive with a looping layup at the buzzer that 
downed UCLA, 91-90. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense was kind of staggered," said Floyd, who had 26 points. "It was 
like going in and out of rows of checkers. I flicked the basketball up just 
before I heard the horn. I knew it was over when I saw it go down. It was the 
greatest feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd hasn't always been so lucky. In a loss to Cal State Fullerton on Feb. 11, 
Floyd cast a 25-footer over outstretched Derek Jones that would have sent the 
game into overtime. Instead the ball ran around the rim twice and spun out. 
Irvine lost, 78-75. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy for a moment when I saw it go in," Floyd said. "But then it barely 
cradled over the rim. It was like someone said, 'No, you're not gonna tie this 
one tonight.' " 
</P>
<P>
Floyd took his revenge on University of the Pacific, and he did it in typical 
fashion -- recklessly. 
</P>
<P>
With Irvine down by one at Stockton with 25 seconds left, Floyd brought the 
ball up court, drove for the hoop too fast, slipped and drew a traveling call. 
Then he fouled Pacific's Reggie Ricks, who nailed a pair of free throws to give 
the Tigers an 83-80 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to remember to slow things up a half step," Floyd said. "Sometimes my 
feet get to moving too fast and I trip over myself. I don't know how quick I'm 
moving, and it's hard to slow down." 
</P>
<P>
With eight seconds left, Floyd didn't slow down, but he got even. He buried an 
off-balance 3-pointer in Ricks' face to tie the game, then bombed another 
3-pointer and hit a pair of free throws in overtime. Floyd finished with 25 
points and the Anteaters fought off the upset, 95-92. 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin is up and down, but he's a big-time athlete," Mulligan said. "He's a 
big-time kid." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd is one of Irvine's big-time scorers as well. He's averaging 15.5 points 
per game, although the Anteaters have switched to a slower offense that tends 
to inhibit his athletic skills. And the 6-5 Floyd, who leads Irvine in assists 
and steals, has moved to point guard, so he's sacrificing a bit of his offense 
for the team. 
</P>
<P>
"Earlier on I'd try to create the shots," he said. "But now, if I get the ball 
and go goofy with it, it may have a ripple effect, and a sophomore or freshman 
might think they can do the same. So I've got to hold back on taking my turn." 
</P>
<P>
Unless the game is on the line. 
</P>
<P>
Some may call Floyd's take-charge attitude selfish. "It all goes back to 
summers as a kid in the city," he said. "We used to play pick-up ball, games 
where you play to 11 baskets, and as soon as the score would get to 7 or 8, I'd 
want the ball. It's not like being greedy, but it feels like every time I touch 
it, it's going in. If I lose at backgammon or cards, I get into fights with my 
girlfriend. I hate to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (11-13, 8-7) is winning more with the precise half-court offense 
Mulligan installed halfway into the season. And that means Floyd and shooting 
guard Palmer are looking inside for center Mike Doktorczyk and forward Ricky 
Butler more often. Herdman, a sophomore forward, has a license to shoot at 
will, and he's leading the nation in 3-point accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm giving up a little scoring, but it looks like I'm doing the overall job," 
Floyd said. "Hopefully, I can do a little bit of everything -- dish off, score, 
play defense." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd's defense has often been a sticking point with Mulligan. "Floyd couldn't 
guard my grandmother, and she's not very good," Mulligan once told reporters. 
He's since changed his tune and often has Floyd guard the opponent's best 
offensive player. 
</P>
<P>
Against Cal State Fullerton, Floyd responded. Although Irvine lost when Floyd's 
shot rimmed out, Floyd held Cedric Ceballos -- the Big West Conference's 
leading scorer -- to 11 points. In the second half, Mulligan switched Floyd to 
Wayne Williams, who had burned Irvine in the first half with a barrage of 
3-pointers. Floyd held him to a pair of baskets. 
</P>
<P>
But offense, not defense, is Floyd's specialty. It was that way in 1984 when 
Floyd was second-team all-state in his senior season at Westchester and helped 
take Coach Ed Azzam to his first City championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd signed with Georgetown University out of high school. In his freshman 
year the Hoyas, led by Patrick Ewing, went 35-3 but lost to Villanova in the 
NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd played in 22 games as a backup to guard Michael Jackson and averaged five 
points a game. But he grew impatient with lack of playing time, and when 
Georgetown Coach John Thompson signed a pair of East Coast guards out of high 
school, Floyd packed his bags for California. 
</P>
<P>
"As a high school player, you just get used to starting," Floyd said. "There I 
was, my second championship game in two years, and I was rarely getting off the 
bench." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd sat out a year and enrolled at Irvine, at the time building the Bren 
Center. UCLA hadn't recruited him, the basketball program at USC was going 
through hard times, and Loyola Marymount seemed a little too close to home, so 
Floyd figured Irvine was perfect. He enrolled in economics at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd averaged eight points a game as a sophomore playing off the bench. He 
blossomed as a junior, averaged 13 points and was named a preseason honorable 
mention All-American by Street and Smith magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a diamond in the rough," Floyd said. "They just buffed up my game here." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd's game has enough luster that Mulligan thinks he has a good chance of 
catching on in the National Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so quick," Mulligan said. "Plus, he's playing the position he would have 
to play in the NBA, point guard." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have a shot if they invite me to a camp," Floyd said. "I've never been 
cut in anything you had to have a tryout to make."

HART RECORDS OVERTIME WIN AGAINST BUENA TO REACH FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH NICHOLS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Buena High girls' basketball team was hoping it had seen the last of Hart's 
Sara Wilson, who sat out the entire third quarter in foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Bulldogs, the junior forward returned midway in the 
fourth quarter, a timely reappearance for the Indians, who beat the Bulldogs, 
78-68 in overtime, in a Southern Section 5-A Division semifinal at Ventura 
College on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Hart will play Santa Barbara, a 44-41 winner over Ontario, in the championship 
game Friday night at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Nikki Brodowy and Wilson each made baskets in the last minute of regulation to 
tie the score, 66-66. Buena had possession with 21 seconds left but was unable 
to score. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson made the first basket in overtime, then missed two free throws before 
fouling out. 
</P>
<P>
"She is one of the keys to this team," Hart Coach Pam Walker said. "Her 
leadership on the floor down the stretch really calmed us down." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her prolonged absence, Wilson, who finished with 13 points, said that 
she never doubted her teammates would fill in for her. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew they would be able to come through with me out, so I wasn't worried," 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Buena (22-4), ranked third in the Southern Section, gave Walker some uneasy 
moments, however. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 54-49, after three quarters, the Bulldogs rallied to tie with 5:58 
left, then took a four-point lead on Marci Ewin's basket with 2:33 to play. 
</P>
<P>
But the No. 2-seeded Indians (24-2), who have won 14 consecutive games, 
outscored Buena, 6-2, in the last two minutes and forced the overtime on 
Wilson's dramatic basket with 25 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Joannie Weinerth's basket with 1:13 left in overtime accounted for Buena's only 
scoring in the three-minute period. 
</P>
<P>
"We did this as a team and everyone contributed," Walker said. "I am just 
really proud of the way they played. 
</P>
<P>
"Buena has been here so many times and this is virgin territory for us." 
</P>
<P>
Buena led, 16-12, after the first quarter. The Indians caught up, 27-27, with 
2:27 left in the first half on Wilson's three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
Anjanette Dionne scored a game-high 20 points to lead Hart, which made 13 of 20 
free throws. Kim Posey added 17 points and Brodowy had 10. Weinerth led Buena 
with 16 points and Jennifer Goodwin added 12.

GLENDALE SETS PLAYOFF AGENDA AFTER 2 OVERTIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale College outscored Golden West, 13-7, in the second overtime to post a 
94-88 win in double overtime in a first-round Southern California regional 
junior college basketball playoff game at Golden West on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's Bruce Heicke made two free throws with four seconds left to tie the 
score, 75-75, at the end of regulation and keep Glendale's season alive. 
</P>
<P>
Markus Muller-Stach led Golden West with 25 points, Alex Kreps had 21 and 
Elbert Davis 14. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West ends the season, 20-12. Glendale (19-11) advances to play at El 
Camino on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In other regional first-round games:

Compton 67, Moorpark 48 -- Moorpark made only 19 of 51 shots from the field and 
committed 13 turnovers in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald McDonald scored a game-high 30 points for Compton (21-10), which will 
play at Riverside in the second round Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (16-15) never led after the opening basket. The Raiders turned the 
ball over nine times before intermission and trailed, 33-22. 
</P>
<P>
Compton's Roy Williams, who scored 12 points and had 12 rebounds, scored eight 
unanswered points to open the second half.

Northridge, 20-7 overall, finished the CCAA season at 8-4. The Lady Matadors 
will face Chapman, the only conference team to defeat them twice this season, 
Thursday night in the opening round of the CCAA tournament at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Patty Held, who scored 35 points for Riverside in its win at Northridge three 
weeks ago, was held to eight this time. Riverside finished 7-19 overall, 2-10 
in the CCAA.

<P>
Paula Lucas scored 14 points and Vicki Mallett added 13 for Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Baptist 82, Cal Lutheran 68 -- Cal Baptist's 7-0 run early in the second 
half turned a one-point edge into an insurmountable lead in the final Golden 
State Athletic Conference game for both schools. 
</P>

Len Mohney never imagined his Canyons baseball team would enter the 10th game 
of its season without home runs from sluggers Don Pedersen, Chris Joy and Peter 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Entering Saturday's nonconference game against visiting Hancock, however, 
Pedersen, Joy and Washington -- the Cougars' third, fourth and fifth batters -- 
each had yet to hit one out of the park. 
</P>
<P>
Mohney juggled his lineup Saturday, leaving Pedersen in the third position, but 
moving Washington, the designated-hitter, to sixth and Joy to seventh. 
</P>
<P>
The moves paid off. Pedersen and Joy each blasted two home runs and Washington 
added another as Canyons hammered Hancock, 16-4. 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen hit a pair of solo home runs, the first in the third inning with 
Canyons trailing, 4-1. Three batters later, Washington smashed a two-run home 
run to tie the score. Joy followed with a solo home run and Canyons (5-5) was 
in the lead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen hit his second home run, in the fifth, to give Canyons a 6-4 lead. In 
the seventh, Joy hit a two-run shot to highlight a six-run explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Jeff Frifth-Smith (2-2) pitched 5 1/3 innings and struck out seven 
to earn the win. Lance Gibson pitched three innings in relief and notched his 
third save. 
</P>
<P>
In other baseball games: 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton 17, The Master's 5 -- Leading, 7-4, after three innings, 
Fullerton scored six runs in the fourth and ran away with the nonconference 
game at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (7-4) collected only two hits in the fourth inning but capitalized on 
three errors. David Staton delivered a three-run double and John Paboojian 
added a run-scoring single. Staton, who was two for three with five RBIs, also 
hit a solo home run. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore left-hander Rich Faulks (1-0), who relieved starter Matt Watson in 
the third inning, allowed one hit in three scoreless innings and picked up the 
win. 
</P>

West Valley 8, Pierce 5 -- Pierce blew a 4-0 lead after two innings and was 
eliminated in the second round of the Mt. San Antonio College tournament. 
</P>

Valley struck for two runs. West Valley scored four more runs on four hits in 
the fourth to take the lead. 
</P>

CSUN PIRATES A VICTORY IN ITS FINAL AT-BAT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Jolly Roger, part of the Cal State Northridge baseball team's new 
swashbuckling image, flaps brazenly in the breeze over Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors have taken to calling their field the House of Doom, and Saturday 
it was the site of a plundering as Northridge stole a 4-3 California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. win from Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, benefiting from a mental mistake by Los Angeles, scored twice in 
the ninth inning to pull out its second conference victory against the Golden 
Eagles in two days. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors are 9-1 overall and 2-0 in conference play, but Coach Bill Kernen 
was less than ecstatic about the way his club performed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel like we're very intimidating right now," Kernen said. "I feel 
like I'm coaching the Ringling Brothers. We're living on the edge. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect them to be the '27 Yankees in two weeks, but we honest to God 
are not playing well. I'm probably the most unhappy 9-1 coach around." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles (5-12, 0-2), which committed seven errors in Friday's CCAA opener, 
made four more Saturday, contributing to two Matador runs. But it was a mental 
mistake by reliever Ed Juarez in the final inning that cost the Golden Eagles 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors trailed, 3-2, entering the ninth, but Denny Vigo and Anton Siegl 
led off with a single and double against reliever Bryan Hatch, who was then 
lifted in favor of Mike Utke. 
</P>
<P>
Utke got Rusty McLain on a grounder to short, but Ted Weisfuss smashed a hard 
grounder off the glove of third baseman Brad Mengel. Shortstop Brent Bish 
picked up the ball and threw home, but it was too late to catch a sliding Vigo 
carrying the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
Exit Utke, enter Juarez, who struck out pinch-hitter Kevin Ogle for the second 
out, then walked Randy Thompson to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Clayton tapped a grounder to the right side that Mike Lau and Ed Pimentel 
converged on, leaving first base uncovered. Second baseman Pimentel came up 
with the ball but had to delay his throw for the late-arriving Juarez. Clayton 
hustled his way safely to the bag while pinch-runner Mike Solar scored the 
winning run. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hit it very well, but I hit it in the right spot," Clayton said. 
</P>
<P>
Vale Lopez (2-0) went the distance for Northridge, allowing seven hits and 
three earned runs. He struck out six and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton led the Matadors' 11-hit attack with three singles. Thompson singled, 
doubled and scored a run.

RIO MESA'S COOK WINS MASTERS TITLE IN 132-POUND CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robby Cook of Rio Mesa High defeated Mike Verbeck of Savanna, 5-3, to win the 
132-pound weight class at the Southern Section Masters wrestling tournament 
Saturday at Fountain Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, the lone winner from the Valley area, qualified for the state 
championships March 3-4 at University of the Pacific in Stockton. The top six 
finishers in each weight class qualified for the state finals. 
</P>
<P>
Other top finishers among Valley-area wrestlers included Chris Kilbane of 
Newbury Park, who placed second in the 154-pound class after losing in the 
final to Chris Mollkoy of Katella, 7-4. Billy Hunter of Westlake finished 
second at 175 pounds after losing in the final, 5-2, to Joe Pastorella of 
Katella. 
</P>
<P>
T. R. Merickel of Channel Islands placed third at 126 pounds with a 5-3 
decision over Pat Kinney of El Dorado. Tony Flores of Rio Mesa finished third 
at 191 pounds with a 9-5 victory over Justin Davis of Paso Robles.

GRUBBS EARNS A THIRD TRIP TO STATE MEET; 
</P>
<P>
EL CAMINO'S 112-POUNDER ADVANCES WITH MASTERS CHAMPIONSHIP

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Grubbs and his brother, John, wore matching baseball caps. The black 
corduroy caps, which have "El Camino Wrestling" embroidered on them, signify 
teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
That teamwork helped Mike, El Camino's 112-pounder, earn a third trip to the 
state meet this year. The same teamwork helped John, El Camino's assistant 
coach, become a two-time state champion in 1986 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Mike, a senior with a 35-2 record, defeated Clairemont's Kay Rattanasinh, 6-3, 
in the finals of the Masters Championships Saturday at Mt. Carmel High School 
to earn the trip to state. 
</P>
<P>
Grubbs had pinned Rattanasinh in the second period of the finals in the 
Division 1-A sectional meet last week but wrestled conservatively in the 
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to win," Grubbs said. "People expected me to 15-point him, but I 
tried to forget that and didn't take any chances." 
</P>
<P>
Grubbs scored an early takedown and led, 2-0, at the end of the first period. 
His other four points were from two takedowns in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
"My intensity level was (bad) tonight," Grubbs said. "I'm right where I want to 
be physically, but mentally I need to take one step more." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Coach John Freeman, who said the match wasn't one of Grubbs' best, 
thinks it can be an advantage preparing for the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't shoot his wad here and try to go into state with false 
expectations," Freeman said. "After this not-so-great match, we can follow up 
with a good week of practice and really focus on state." Last year Grubbs took 
second in the state meet at 105 pounds. The year before, as a sophomore -- the 
same year John won at 105 -- Mike took fifth at 98. 
</P>
<P>
John has seen the profession of Mike, who has become a technician because of 
wrestling freestyle in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, he was passive," John said. "Now he's a power wrestler. He has good 
speed and knowledge of the sport." 
</P>
<P>
Grubbs wrestled the season at 119 before cutting to 112 for the section. He did 
the same last year, cutting from 112 to 105, and he said it helps him mentally 
because he is stronger than the others in his weight class. 
</P>
<P>
Mike is the only returning state place winner on El Camino's team this year, an 
inspiration to teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"They respect him, and when he's in practice, he can set the tempo. The other 
kids get better because of it," Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
Grubbs, who is considering Fullerton, Stanford and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo as 
possible colleges, is as hard-working in the classroom as he is in the practice 
room. 
</P>
<P>
"He is an upstanding individual and an excellent role model," Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
Grubbs' teammate, Danial Ramirez, the 98-pound Masters champion, will accompany 
him to the state meet next weekend in Stockton. Ramirez defeated Serra's Earl 
Reagon, 2-1, in the finals.

SOCCER PLAYOFF ROUNDUP;

<P>
TORREY PINES GIRLS TURN TABLES TO DEFEAT MIRA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deirdra Brandes scored 10 minutes into the second half on a free kick, and 
Christy Peters added another goal to lead visiting Torrey Pines (15-4-2) to a 
2-0 victory over Mira Mesa in a San Diego Section 3-A girls' soccer playoff 
quarterfinal Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Peters scored after taking the ball at the halfway line, beating a couple of 
Mira Mesa players downfield and then beating the goalie. 
</P>
<P>
Jen Rogin had an assist for Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you win an away game, it's a good result," Torrey Pines Coach Dennis 
Costello said. "The girls did an excellent job." 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded Mira Mesa defeated Torrey Pines, 2-0, earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines advanced to Wednesday's semifinal against top-seeded Bonita Vista, 
a 4-0 winner over Mt. Carmel. Torrey Pines defeated Bonita Vista earlier this 
year, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be a good game," Costello said. "It's always a good game when we play." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time all season, Torrey Pines is suiting up its full roster of 16 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't played well due to injuries and sickness, but at least everyone was 
there (against Mira Mesa)," Costello said. "It was something to see. I had 
forgotten some of the girls' first names." 
</P>
<P>
In other 3-A girls' quarterfinals: 
</P>
<P>
Poway 3, Monte Vista 0 -- Erin-Mary Barrett, Kyle Clark and Kirby Seale each 
scored a goal for visiting Poway, which shut out Monte Vista behind goalie 
Wendy Kevan. "Our defense played very, very well," said Poway Coach Gary 
Bradshaw. Poway is 15-4-5. 
</P>
<P>
San Dieguito 1, Serra 0 -- Kathy Conklin scored from the right corner midway 
through the second period on a pass from Stefanie Case to give No. 2-seeded San 
Dieguito a victory at home. The Mustangs (20-2-4) recorded their 18th shutout 
for the season. Serra dropped to 9-10-4. 
</P>
<P>
Boys 
</P>
<P>
3-A quarterfinals 
</P>
<P>
Bonita Vista 2, Mira Mesa 0 -- Justin May and Jeff Yakubic each scored on a 
header off of a corner kick for visiting Bonita Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater 2, Hilltop 1 -- Charles Adair scored for No. 2 Hilltop (14-3-1). 
</P>
<P>
Poway 3, Torrey Pines 2 (2 OT) -- Poway outscored Torrey Pines, 4-3, on penalty 
kicks after the second overtime.

GORDON ON ROLL, WINS 2ND IN A ROW

<P>
Youth was again served in the Grand National Sport Truck class at the Mickey 
Thompson Off-Road Championship Gran Prix stop at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Robby Gordon, 20, rallied from two disappointing heat races to win his second 
main event in as many races before 42,256 -- the largest crowd to see a 
motorsports event at Jack Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
It was a disappointing finish, however, for Gordon's Toyota teammate, Ivan 
Stewart of Lakeside. Stewart easily won both heats and looked strong entering 
the main event. But Stewart, who has never won a main event in San Diego, 
suffered mechanical problems and dropped out of the race after five laps. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, the 43-year-old veteran, was in third when he started to fade while 
Gordon, in only his first year in the class, took control early and never 
trailed in the 12-lap final. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon had an impressive start in the series this season, sweeping both heats 
and the main in the series' first stop in Anaheim in January. 
</P>
<P>
But it looked as if Gordon's fast start would fade during the two heats. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon's troubles started in the first heat when Roger Mears flipped in front 
of him on the second turn. By the time Gordon could pull out from between Mears 
and the turn, he was in ninth. Gordon finished the heat in fourth but was 
dropped two spots when he and two other drivers were penalized for rough 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, meanwhile, had little trouble in either heat, leading most of the way 
in both. 
</P>
<P>
After the crash set him back in the first heat, Gordon ran fifth most of the 
second before pulling up to finish third. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm not going to win every race," Gordon said. "I probably won't even 
win a third. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to have a lot of luck. It's so tight, and an accident can happen in 
a split second." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, who nearly quit during the middle of last season while driving in the 
Super 1600 series because of mechanical problems and not having a sponsor, went 
on to have a successful season and finished the year by becoming the youngest 
driver to be named to the off-road racing All-American team by the American 
Auto Racing Writers &amp; Broadcasters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has been a success in other off-road events, Gordon was surprise in 
the Grand National Truck class, racing against veteran drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the San Diego stop, however, Gordon thought the fast start at Anaheim 
would help him. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I know in my head I can win," Gordon said. "I feel real, real good." 
</P>
<P>
Tallon Vohland of Sacramento won the 250cc Pro UltraCross. Brian Manly of Lake 
Elsinore was second and Jim Holley of Woodland Hills was third. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Coyne of Lemon Grove finished third in the Super 1600 main while Bob 
Gordon, Robby's father, finished second. 
</P>
<P>
It was a busy night for Frank Arciero Jr., who won the main and his heat in the 
Super 1600 and then had to run to his truck to compete in the Grand National 
Truck Class. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Elrod, the 1988 points champion in UltraStock, won the class' main event 
after finishing second in the heat. Vincent Tjelmeland won the heat but 
finished fourth in the main. 
</P>
<P>
Rory Holiday of Fontana swept the Superlite class, winning the main and the 
heat. Frank Chavez of Lakeside finished fifth in the event's main and was third 
in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Pierce of El Cajon, who won the event point race in 1987 and finished 
second last year, had mechanical problems and had to be towed from both races.

CHARGING CALL SETS UP SAN DIEGO FOR VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Depending on perspective, Adalberto Silva was either finally caught or falsely 
charged. He was charged with charging. 
</P>
<P>
And host San Diego (19-4) thus charged ahead in the Division I boys' basketball 
playoffs with a 59-55 victory over Southwest (21-8) Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego will play Valhalla in a semifinal Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty six seconds remained. Southwest trailed, 56-55. Silva turned his hulking 
frame for a turnaround bank shot, which dropped neatly in the basket. One 
problem. The referee whistled him for charging into San Diego forward Clark 
James. 
</P>
<P>
That made five fouls for Silva, who danced around with a look of disgust on his 
face before returning to the bench, kicking it and taking a seat. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, on the other end of the floor, James made one of two free throws. 
Southwest had one last chance, but Will Tate's attempt to drive for a layup 
resulted in a lot of glass and nothing else. James got the ball back, was 
fouled and connected on two free throws to seal it. 
</P>
<P>
So now we hear from both sides. Was it a charge, or wasn't it? 
</P>
<P>
"It was a charge," James said matter-of-factly in the winners' locker room. "He 
just messed up at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
And the defendant's view? 
</P>
<P>
"Personally," Silva said, "I don't think I charged. I was doing the same move 
the whole game, and I didn't get called. I guess that's the way it goes." 
</P>
<P>
Now for a somewhat objective opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it was much of an offensive foul, but it was consistent with 
the way the game was being called," San Diego Coach Dennis Kane said. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at pregame warmups, it would have been difficult to tell this game 
would come down to the final seconds. Southwest is a group of over-achievers. 
San Diego is a bunch of talent. If nothing else, San Diego's superior height 
would have figured to make this a rout. 
</P>
<P>
But Southwest just kept pestering the bigger team with its full-court press. It 
kept frustrating the bigger team with Tate, the spirited point guard who 
finished with 25 points to tie with James for game-high scoring total. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great team," Kane said of Southwest. "The sum is greater than the 
parts." 
</P>
<P>
Just not great enough. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest took a 51-50 lead with just more than 3 minutes remaining on a Tate 
layup. San Diego center Milton Miller, who finished with 23 points, answered 
with a bank shot. James followed soon after with a jump shot, giving San Diego 
a three-point lead and forcing Southwest to play catchup the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>

Dr. Herbert Abrams talks about nuclear war not only as a radiologist who might 
have to treat the wounds it would inflict, but also as a man whose organization 
won a 1985 Nobel Peace Prize for trying to keep such a war from happening. 
There will be no way to try the superpowers for malpractice for using nuclear 
weapons, says Abrams, so the best insurance is a world fully informed of the 
consequences of nuclear war and working to reduce its likelihood. 
</P>
<P>
The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, a body Abrams 
helped establish, outlines nuclear risks in forums and publications around the 
world. Closer to home, Abrams, a physician who has written many of the 
textbooks about diagnosing heart disease, lectures to Stanford University 
undergraduates about accidental nuclear war -- and about the danger of 
annihilation inherent in a world where weapons could be stolen by terrorists or 
decisions blurred by a disabled President. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress toward arms reduction in the last Reagan years, Abrams is 
worried about continuing that progress under George Bush, concerned that Bush 
went out of the mainstream and veered toward the right during his presidential 
campaign. And "the agenda of the radical right demands some kind of obeisance 
in the international arena." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has a window of opportunity that may not come again soon, Abrams suggests, 
recalling a dinner conversation he had with Andrei Sakharov at the dissident 
physicist's Moscow apartment. Sakharov spoke of a rigid system in which "no 
amount of good will or intelligent planning or glasnost or perestroika or 
democratization" can necessarily achieve within an acceptable time frame what 
the Soviet people want to see. 
</P>
<P>
"Sakharov is not sanguine about the chances of (Soviet President Mikhail S.) 
Gorbachev staying in power," Abrams said, adding that if tangible change is to 
occur in the arms-control arena, it therefore must happen in the next three to 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an enormous opportunity to move ahead aggressively in 
arms-control agreements that are really savage cuts," Abrams added, "and I'm 
not sure that George Bush has the stamina and the durability to accept the 
radical right's critique that he would be compromising our security. Instead of 
having 20 times overkill, we'll have only 12 or 11 or 10. I think it's an 
opportunity which we've really got to grasp." 
</P>
<P>
Abrams speaks of such concerns in the low-key manner of an instructor who might 
be telling a medical student how to take an X-ray. How can he be so understated 
in talking of nuclear war? The subject, after all, is about the possible deaths 
of millions of people. It is also about the number of military people with drug 
or alcohol problems who have had their fingers near the nuclear trigger. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an area in which I think hyperbole can really obscure some of the 
seriousness of the problems," said the 68-year-old physician during a recent 
interview in his basement office at Stanford's School of Medicine. "I think the 
facts speak for themselves." Besides, he added, "I've got an actor in my 
family" already. His brother, Mason Adams, is the dry voice in dozens of 
commercials and the man who played managing editor Charley Hume to Ed Asner's 
Lou Grant. 
</P>
<P>
Abrams remembers the time when, for him, concern turned into activism during 
Jimmy Carter's presidency: "In the early 1960s, a lot of us were concerned 
about testing in the atmosphere; radiologists had to be concerned about that," 
Abrams recalled. "Then the partial test ban came and I was frankly fully 
involved running a department of radiology, participating in the activities of 
a medical school," first at Stanford and later at Harvard. But with increasing 
tensions in the Persian Gulf, the unthinkable -- that is, use of nuclear 
weapons -- moved into the category of the thinkable. And Abrams became 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
"Carter's approach to this was that we might have to use any weapon that was 
available to us in order to make certain the free flow of oil," to ensure 
protection of American interests. Drawn by Carter's policies to study the 
issue, Abrams discovered that "virtually every President from Eisenhower on 
considered the use of nuclear weapons . . . . It began to dawn on me that these 
weapons of annihilation were being considered for use in the settlement of 
disputes between nations when I had honestly not thought that that was ever in 
the cards." 
</P>
<P>
One of Abrams' early contributions was a report on the medical problems of 
survivors of nuclear war, published in November, 1981, in the New England 
Journal of Medicine. Among survivors, millions would have trauma or burns. A 
third of those would have radiation sickness as well. The radiation to which 
they had been subjected would increase susceptibility to infection, as would 
subsequent hardships. Food and drinkable water would be in increasingly short 
supply. On top of all that, fewer than 80,000 doctors might be left alive to 
treat the injured. 
</P>
<P>
Abrams thinks Physicians for Social Responsibility, which holds its national 
meeting March 10 and 11 in Palo Alto, has played a major role in telling the 
public "what medicine could and could not do if there was a massive exchange." 
People have begun to understand that talk about survival or a winnable nuclear 
war really has no relationship to reality, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
Physicists, educators, engineers and business people all played a role, but 
Abrams thinks doctors were central. "Physicians are a conservative bunch. This 
was a conservation of health and life issue." 
</P>
<P>
The chance to be a bridge between those doctors and arms controllers brought 
Abrams back in 1985 to Stanford -- where he'd done his medical residence and 
taught for 16 years -- after almost two decades at Harvard. Today, he is not 
only a professor of radiology but also a member-in-residence of Stanford's 
Center for International Security and Arms Control. The center examines arms 
control with experts from several disciplines, including politics, history and 
science. Abrams felt he could bring together "the physicians, who are 
suspicious of the arms controllers as people who want to manage the stockpiles, 
and the arms controllers who wonder about these kooky doctors invading their 
territory." 
</P>
<P>
As early as the late 1970s, Abrams and several medical colleagues had 
revitalized a U.S. group known as Physicians for Social Responsibility. By 1981 
they had met with doctors from the Soviet Union, Japan, Canada and various 
Western European nations. Among the key leaders were U.S. doctors Bernard Lown, 
James Muller, Eric Chivian and Abrams, plus Evgueni Chazov of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The American participants always made clear to their Soviet counterparts that 
"the organization would be professional, medical and scientific and that the 
moment it was used as a propaganda vehicle for the Soviet Union or for the 
United States or for anyone, that our interest in it would terminate. 
</P>
<P>
"There may have been a few individuals who looked at the Soviet Union through 
rose-colored classes," Abrams said. But most had no illusions. The real 
question "is whether we were able -- working through individuals who at that 
time, in the Brezhnev era, were obviously acceptable to the leadership -- were 
we able to get access to Soviet society in any way, shape or form? The answer 
is yes, we were able to. Were they free to criticize their own government the 
way we are here? No, not at all. 
</P>
<P>
"But so long as they accepted our agenda, whether that coincided with theirs, 
that was fine with us . . . so long as they understood that a sense of alarm 
and concern had to be conveyed broadly through the world."

AN EMPEROR'S FUNERAL TESTS DEMOCRACY IN JAPAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Emperor Hirohito's death on Jan. 7 and his burial on Friday represent key 
chapters in an unfolding national drama -- and the stakes include survival of 
Japan as a political democracy. Tension began two years ago when the emperor 
had major surgery. From that point on, an unprecedented war of nerves gradually 
mounted. When the late emperor suffered a serious relapse last September, alarm 
bells began to ring in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
We Americans have had a poorly perceived but genuine role in this drama, based 
on the growing U.S. insistence that Japan rearm -- the process Washington 
cheerfully refers to as "burden sharing." 
</P>
<P>
"Why is Ronald Reagan trying to destroy Japanese democracy?" I used to hear 
that question many times during the Reagan years from left-wing Japanese 
critics of American foreign policy. But then when an influential local editor 
and former university classmate of mine -- a man who has studied at Harvard and 
has no socialist leanings of any sort -- pushed this question at me two years 
ago I knew that the Japanese mass media was gearing up for an unprecedented war 
of nerves. At the center of the struggle was the "slippery slope" argument. 
</P>
<P>
The slippery slope is as old a controversy as the postwar "MacArthur" 
constitution: Rearming will lead to resurgent nationalism and fierce 
nationalism will lead to the death of democracy. Many American critics have 
dismissed the argument as an idle left-wing obsession but the anti-conservative 
opposition in Japan already feels that it is dying the death of a thousand 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The most sensitive battle of all has been over what place the emperor -- once 
the supreme focus of nationalism -- is to occupy in the self-definition of the 
Japanese people. How the late emperor died, how his passing was received by the 
country and how the new emperor articulates his constitutional function has 
been testing Japan's national posture as no other event could. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese man in the street has been the object of this struggle, rarely an 
actor in it. The real battle has been between elites over what message, what 
image, what interpretation was to be transmitted to the public via print and 
electronic media. 
</P>
<P>
Often covert and subtle, this contest for the hearts and minds of a nation has 
been the central story of the last nerve-racking five months, leaving Japanese 
reporters blurry-eyed with exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the exhaustion was caused by fear. Reporting on the imperial 
institution is a nightmare of linguistic snares, social taboos and 
interpretational bear-traps. When a Japanese editor at the English-language 
Mainichi Daily News accidentally ran his newspaper's carefully prepared 
obituary before the emperor died, the man lost his job and his boss was 
demoted. 
</P>
<P>
The mistake was partly a consequence of automated printing, but this was no 
excuse. To speak of the emperor's passing before the fact was inauspicious in 
the extreme. Especially on the right-wing of Japanese political opinion, many 
people thought that the president of Mainichi Shimbun, the huge parent of the 
Mainichi Daily News, should have resigned as well. 
</P>
<P>
On two consecutive days, the Mainichi Daily ran a front-page apology; the 
earlier piece, labeled an "extremely grave error," was "canceled" and 
"retracted." Notice of the firing and demotion were given prominent play in the 
unambiguous hope that such sacrifices would ward off social censure -- and 
discourage right-wing violence. 
</P>
<P>
Such fears are not the product of overworked journalistic imagination. The 
Asahi Shimbun, Japan's second largest daily, has repeatedly had its offices 
around the country bombed. In 1987, there was a rifle assault on the 
newspaper's branch in Hyogo Prefecture that left one reporter dead, another in 
grave condition. These anonymous attacks on the most conspicuous defender of 
Japan's postwar settlement and constitution are almost certainly the work of 
one or more right-wing radical groups. The country has as many as 800 of them. 
</P>
<P>
Where violence and physical intimidation are judged inappropriate, the radical 
right has other, more sophisticated tactics. When the Japanese version of 
Penthouse (published by Kodansha) ran a story claiming a sexual scandal in the 
imperial household, rightists brought pressure on advertisers. Eventually the 
magazine had to halt publication, but the final issue included a formal apology 
to the imperial family. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is that most formidable weapon: the oversized speaker-car. Armed 
with as many as 20 separate speakers, these cars can make normal conversation 
impossible for 1,000 yards in any direction. Last year, the right mobilized 
more than 100 such vehicles to lay siege on the annual meeting of Japan's 
Teachers' Union (Nikkyo-so), which is uncompromisingly opposed to any form of 
Japanese rearmament. Other speaker-car targets have included Akahata, the 
official organ of the Japan Communist Party, the most fearless critic of 
Japan's emperor system. 
</P>
<P>
Since mid-September when the nation began what was in effect a deathwatch, 
speaker-cars have been conspicuous by their absence. The streets of Tokyo took 
on an eerie quiet as right-wing groups agreed that nothing should disturb the 
high solemnity of the Japanese nation in official mourning. Now that the 
emperor has been buried, a major demonstration of muscle by the country's 
120,000 self-proclaimed rightists (many of them gangsters) is confidently 
predicted by many observers. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the wide and diverse world of the Japanese right -- the young 
tough in his speaker-car, the intellectual in his think tank or the ruling 
party ideologue on the hustings -- has been struck a blow from an unexpected 
source: the new emperor himself. 
</P>
<P>
The essence of action within the closed court of the imperial Japanese house is 
the symbolic gesture. Just as a classical drama can turn on the absence of a 
chair or the slightest abandonment of formal speech, the new occupant of the 
Chrysanthemum Throne made a revolutionary gesture in his first formal address 
by merely adding the honorific san in speaking of and to the Japanese people, 
something his father would have never dreamed of doing. 
</P>
<P>
Another move also stunned Japanese conservatives: The new monarch used the 
occasion of his first address to come down firmly in favor of Japan's postwar 
constitution. Many conservatives object to the constitution's peace clause, its 
symbolic definition of the emperor and its foreign authorship. 
</P>
<P>
The speech immediately raised two sensitive questions. Since the Imperial 
Household Agency no longer appears to attract the ablest civil servants and 
since the new emperor has yet to assemble his own group of top advisers, did he 
write the speech himself? Many Japanese commentators suspect that he did. 
</P>
<P>
Second, and still more interesting, why did Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita 
approve the content of an address so obviously contrary to his political 
party's traditional notions of upholding imperial dignity and its opposition to 
the 1946 constitution? 
</P>
<P>
One veteran Japanese journalist who has covered the imperial household insists 
that former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone would never have accepted the 
address as written; only Takeshita's awe of the imperial institution and his 
own lack of clear ideological principles allowed the speech to be presented. 
Other well-informed sources disagree, insisting that the emperor would have had 
his way in any case. 
</P>
<P>
The net result of last week's burial is mixed. The Japanese right can claim a 
major victory for intensive education in nationalist sentiment during the last 
month. Yet the new emperor's stance seems to confirm the view of those who 
argue that the modern Japanese imperial court has always looked in the right 
direction even if it sometimes found itself in the wrong end of the room. 
</P>
<P>
Whispered speculation that the emperor's liberal stance makes him vulnerable to 
right-wing protests -- or worse -- remains just that: speculation. But there is 
no question that Japan has been experiencing an extraordinary historical 
turning point. The test of a democratic society has so far been met, but it has 
been a close run. More important, the drama is not yet finished.

A MASTER RACIST JUMPS PARTIES TO LAND IN THE LOUISIANA LEGISLATURE

<P>
David Duke's election to the Louisiana Legislature casts a shadow over the 
whole political landscape. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican Party has been humiliated by the victory of a 38-year old former 
Ku Klux Klan grand wizard who defeated GOP loyalist John Treen by 224 votes. 
Duke had registered Republican just before the race and his triumph is an 
embarrassment at a time when GOP Chairman Lee Atwater and others are trying to 
attract black voters. 
</P>
<P>
American journalism also lost. Duke humbled the media by putting distance 
between himself and ideas he had advocated for 20 years, using local TV news to 
orchestrate the image of a sleek conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters focused largely on the Klan connection, one Duke claims he left in 
1980. They let him skirt a larger issue: Duke's belief in the theory of a 
master race and his current neo-Nazi links. The result was inadequate public 
information. 
</P>
<P>
The election was also a loss for the city. A 99.6% white suburb voted its fury 
against next door New Orleans, with its black voting majority and a recent wave 
of black homicides; several street battles broke out this year after the Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day march. Duke also enjoyed a strange climate of historical 
amnesia suffered by his potential enemies during the campaign: Black leaders 
showed profound apathy and Jewish leaders said little, apparently afraid to 
raise emotional temperatures in middle-class Metairie. 
</P>
<P>
An ideological virus pulsing with anti-Semitism has worked its way into the 
body politic, finally gaining an elected seat after nearly a decade of 
campaigning. In 1983, Duke's one-time ally in the KKK, Tom Metzger of 
Fallbrook, Calif., left the Klan after having won the 1980 Democratic primary 
in a San Diego congressional district with 33,000 votes. Metzger, who led 
patrols to keep Mexican immigrants out and advocated marksmanship classes in 
schools, was eventually trounced by former Rep. Clair Burgener in the general 
election, but his primary victory proved that a political opening existed. 
</P>
<P>
That same year, a former Nazi Party leader in North Carolina, Harold Covington, 
received 43% of the vote in a losing race for attorney general -- running as a 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Late last November, Duke embarked on twin campaigns. One was the Statehouse 
election designed to soften his racist image -- the "new" Duke in quest of 
political acceptability. The other was an ideological extension of his 1988 
presidential try on the Populist Party ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Launched in 1982, the Populist Party is the brainchild of Robert Weems, a 
Jackson, Miss., leader of Klan resurgence, and Willis A. Carto of Torrance, 
Calif. The party is scheduled to have a convention in Chicago, March 4-5, with 
David Duke as a speaker. The new Populists, like the new Duke, take labels 
loosely. The original Populists of the 1890s were farmers who rebelled against 
escalating rural credit and railway freight rates; it was a grass-roots 
movement of cooperative marketing and purchasing outlets. The farmers forged 
ties with urban trade unions, creating the People's Party, otherwise known as 
Populists. By the early 1900s, the movement had expired. 
</P>
<P>
A strain of anti-Semitism did mark early populism but it was not a dominant 
characteristic. Carto glorified that strain. In 1955 he founded the Liberty 
Lobby in Washington, which the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai Brith considers 
"the most active anti-Semitic organization in the country . . . a 
multimillion-dollar operation." Another Carto spinoff, the Institute for 
Historical Review, has argued that the Nazi Holocaust is a hoax. Several years 
ago, IHR offered $50,000 if anyone could "prove" the existence of Nazi death 
camps. A Jewish survivor collected $90,000 in an out-of-court settlement. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Duke reportedly twice met with Carto in California. As early as 1970, 
he seemed to share some of Carto's sympathy for the Third Reich. As an 
undergraduate at Louisiana State University, Duke put on a uniform with 
swastika to protest a speech by attorney William Kuntsler and carried a sign 
saying "Gas the Chicago 7" -- Kuntsler's clients. Last month Duke called that 
incident "a lark . . . something I now regret." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, he wrote a "Dear Patriot" letter to fellow Klansmen, calling the 
Holocaust a hoax, "perpetrated on Christians by Jews." Soon thereafter he left 
the Klan and formed the National Assn. for the Advancement of White People. 
Today, Duke calls the NAAWP "a civil-rights organization," stressing that it 
has nonprofit IRS status. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Hill, a Tulane University doctoral candidate in history, has followed the 
NAAWP News during the decade. Hill says "the contrast between Duke's campaign 
persona and his activist ideology can largely be attributed to his belief in 
the strategic necessity of political deception. In 1984 the NAAWP News observed 
that since the public still regarded white supremacy as immoral, racist 
activists should conceal their opinions and 'never refer to racial superiority 
or inferiority, only talk about racial differences, carefully avoiding value 
judgments.' " 
</P>
<P>
The same year, the News reprinted an article from Instauration -- an avowedly 
anti-Semitic publication -- advocating segregation of ethnic Americans in 
geographic zones. All Jews would live in Manhattan and Long Island, renamed 
West Israel, blacks would live in the gulf South, renamed New Africa, and 
Latinos in a strip of the Southwest, renamed Alta California. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 3, when James Gill of the New Orleans Times-Picayune wrote a scathing 
column about that plan, Duke said that the News published controversial 
articles with which he himself did not always agree. 
</P>
<P>
The current issue of Instauration features an interview with Duke conducted in 
December. "I came to understand," he says, "that the most universal element in 
the well-being of any society is the biological quality of the people. I 
learned that once the gene pool was damaged, all hope and promise for the 
future would be lost irretrievably." 
</P>
<P>
NAAWP News advertises mail-order books of raw anti-Semitism. Duke's own 
booklet, "Who Runs the Media?" -- four copies for $3 -- purportedly documents 
"Zionist control of America's mass media." The News also sells tapes of the 
late George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party. 
</P>
<P>
The day after his election, Duke announced: "I have a hand of friendship out to 
the Jewish community." But when reporters from the national and local media 
began pressing him on his Nazi ties and his support for the Holocaust hoax 
theory, Duke refused to discuss "what I did 10 years ago" and abruptly halted 
the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, running for President first as a Democrat, Duke bought TV spots in 
Louisiana and won 23,000 votes on Super Tuesday -- more than Bruce E. Babbitt 
and Paul Simon. In Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas he won 18,000 more. 
Then he jumped to the Populist Party, announcing: "The one primary issue before 
us is whether our heritage and our way of life, our very bloodline, is 
preserved in this nation." Duke received 42,778 votes in 11 states last 
November. His Populist campaign director was Ralph Forbes of Arkansas, a former 
captain in Rockwell's American Nazi Party. 
</P>
<P>
Duke's links to Carto, the Liberty Lobby or master racism never became an issue 
in the February election. Reports tagged him "a former Klansman" -- ignoring 
the rest. That Duke's name and address appear on the list of "support 
organizations" published in the newsletter of the New Order -- a 
Milwaukee-based Nazi movement -- never surfaced as a campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
One man who tried to pin down Duke's past was Mordechai Levy, leader of the 
radical Jewish Defense Organization in New York. He spent five days in New 
Orleans in early February: Treen attacked him as an outside agitator and the 
media cast him as a spoiler. Duke called Levy "a terrorist." Levy's presence 
created a swell of anger in Metairie; so did Treen endorsements from Ronald 
Reagan and President George Bush. "Outside interference" -- the old 
segregationist war cry during the civil-rights era -- surfaced anew, helping 
Duke. 
</P>
<P>
Not until the day before the election did the Times-Picayune report Duke's 
relationship with Forbes, in an article omitting reference to Carto and the 
impact of Liberty Lobby. That same day, a media blunder after the noon news 
played into Duke's hands. WWL, the CBS affiliate, telecast a statement by Phil 
Johnson, a portly, often eloquent editorialist; without endorsing Treen, 
Johnson cautiously warned voters about Duke's past. 
</P>
<P>
Duke immediately demanded equal time. Johnson refused. Duke attorneys 
threatened a protest with the Federal Communications Commission. The station, 
after conferring with its attorneys, decided to grant the equal time. Then, on 
the 5 p.m. news on election eve, Duke went on the air endorsing himself, saying 
the FCC had forced WWL's hand. "We never spoke to the FCC," says Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The next night at Duke's campaign reception, I circulated among his supporters 
before the vote count. Besides locals, people had come from Arkansas, 
Mississippi, Florida and other parts of Louisiana. I have never seen such raw 
anger. 
</P>
<P>
"Phil Johnson is a communist!" one man yelled. "Jews control the media!" 
shrilled others. For 30 minutes three men regaled me, insisting that the 
Holocaust was a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
Then Duke came to the podium, beaming. "I don't think there's ever been a 
candidate more lied about and hurt than I was," he said. Then he promised that 
more candidates like him will be coming forward, "across this state, across the 
Southland and the country." 
</P>
<P>
Duke, with his blond hair, dark mustache and articulate delivery, was as cool 
as the other side of the pillow -- a perfect media candidate.

FROM J.P. MORGAN TO RJR, CONGRESS LAGS BEHIND LBOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

author of The Cost of Good Intentions, an analysis of the New York fiscal 
crisis.

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost everyone knows that the recent leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. by 
the investment firm of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts, valued at about $25 billion, 
is the biggest business deal in history. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer people know that the deal it beat out for first place happened 87 years 
ago, when J. Pierpont Morgan emerged from a series of titanic confrontations 
with Carnegie, Harriman and Rockefeller interests to take total control of U.S. 
Steel Co., an enormous national conglomerate of steel mills, coal mines and 
shipping and railroad lines -- the biggest company in the history of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, he of the massive silences, towering rages and sudden tears, whose 
associates all "made liberal profits, toiled madly and died young," put 
together his U.S. Steel deal with $1.4 billion (about $23 billion in today's 
dollars) in preferred stock, common shares, 60-year mortgage bonds and a 
bewildering variety of other instruments. The total face value of the company's 
paper was far in excess of its visible assets -- "pure water," the financial 
press sniffed. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's deal would still be the biggest in history, in fact, if Andrew 
Carnegie had not agreed to a price so quickly, for Morgan was willing to pay 
much more. The purchasers of Morgan's "watered" paper -- the term "junk bond" 
had not been invented yet -- eventually all made large profits on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Leveraged buyouts, or "LBOs," have been around a long time. "Leverage" is Wall 
Street jargon for debt. In a typical LBO, investors put up about 15% of the 
cash for the deal and borrow the rest. Banks lend about half the debt and 
usually hold a mortgage on all or most of the company's assets. The rest comes 
from insurance companies, mutual funds and other big players who buy the "junk 
bonds" -- bonds that pay a high rate of interest but little security beyond the 
hope of the company's success. 
</P>
<P>
The jargon has changed since Morgan's day but the principles of leveraged 
takeovers are much the same. Much else has not changed. Morgan exaggerated the 
benefits from his activities, just as today's deal makers do, and the financial 
press exaggerated the dangers, just as they do today. 
</P>
<P>
There have been several distinct phases of the 1980s buyout boom. The first 
deals, beginning about 1982, were pure asset plays. Stock market prices were 
low -- the Dow Jones industrial average had been virtually unchanged for 15 
years. The stock price of oil companies, for example, was typically much lower 
than the value of the oil they owned. It was inevitable that canny 
entrepreneurs, such as T. Boone Pickens, would realize they could borrow money, 
buy the stock, then sell the oil to pay off the loan. 
</P>
<P>
The second round of LBOs focused on company cash flows. Partly because the tax 
code makes interest payments deductible, a company often threw off enough cash 
to handle a burden of debt considerably higher than the total price of its 
stock. It made sense for managers to team with an investment bank to borrow the 
money to buy out their own company. A company's own managers were arguably in a 
better position to estimate their long-run cash flows than the public markets, 
particularly since they knew better than anyone which layers of bureaucracy to 
cut to improve earnings. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1980s, LBOs were a full-fledged Wall Street industry. A small group 
of highly specialized buyout firms -- like Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts -- 
organized the deals. Banks set up LBO lending departments. Drexel Burnham 
Lambert's Michael Milken and a host of imitators created a market for the junk 
bonds. Insurance companies and mutual funds organized specialized portfolios to 
invest in junk bonds, and the major Japanese financial houses set aside large 
amounts of capital for LBOs. 
</P>
<P>
Financial markets are dimwitted and slow-moving, and it took about five years 
for stock prices to move toward some approximation of companies' LBO values. 
(Slow-footed creatures often have trouble stopping as well -- hence the 1987 
crash.) 
</P>
<P>
Higher stock prices, of course, make good deals harder to find. A scarcity of 
deals, the large amounts of capital looking for LBOs and the big fee 
opportunities for deal makers -- Kohlberg Kravis reportedly made $75 million in 
fees on RJR Nabisco -- intensifies the LBO competition. 
</P>
<P>
A number of recent transactions, like RJR Nabisco itself, and Robert Campeau's 
purchase of Federated Department Stores, appear to be so high-priced that they 
leave little margin for error -- hence the sudden worries that overleveraged 
corporate America is heading for a crash. The worries, while not groundless, 
are usually exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
In the first place, while corporate debt has risen sharply in the 1980s, debt 
service still consumes only about 20% of corporate cash flows, a readily 
sustainable level. Some individual overleveraged companies may be heading for 
trouble, of course, but the overall data are not alarming. 
</P>
<P>
LBO investors, in addition, are big boys; mom and pop are not in the market at 
all. The high rates of interest on junk bonds reflect the probability of an LBO 
getting into trouble, and most investors have staying power to wait out bad 
patches. Junk bonds are really a new form of stock with a high current pay-out 
as long as a company is successful. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there is no doubt that LBOs and the threat of LBOs have been 
debureaucratizing big companies. Multiple layers of management, the corporate 
jets, the soccer-field offices, the company artwork, are all being sacrificed 
to produce cash. In that sense, LBOs are a form of owner revolt. Because of the 
sorry record of U.S. big-company management, stockholders and bondholders want 
company earnings paid out directly; they will decide for themselves how to 
reinvest. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, LBOs do not "consume capital." Money paid out in debt service or to 
buy junk bonds doesn't disappear down black holes. It simply changes hands, and 
the new holders can reinvest it as they please. 
</P>
<P>
There are legitimate worries. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is 
rightly concerned about heavy bank lending to LBOs. Banks play a key role in 
our monetary system. When they get in trouble, as Continental Illinois National 
Bank &amp; Trust Co. did during the oil-lending fad, or as many others did 
during the Third World lending fad, they run to the government for help. Some 
limits on LBO portfolios would seem prudent. 
</P>
<P>
Investment banks often take large risks relative to their capital when they 
"bridge" LBO deals. Typically, a group of investment banks will buy all the 
junk bonds to sell them out to investors later. A big deal that turned sour 
during the bridge period could put some investment banks under water and cause 
a thrombosis in the financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is the persistent worry that the cruel cash discipline in LBO 
companies will reduce productive investment and research. The evidence, in 
fact, is mixed -- although a recent National Science Foundation study found 
that LBO companies, on average, spend much less on R&amp;D than their peers. 
</P>
<P>
LBOs were an outgrowth of the low stock prices and low investor opinion of 
corporate management in the early 1980s. The high prices of recent deals 
suggest that the fad has probably run its course. The political instinct to 
rush in and regulate usually comes at the last stages of a financial cycle -- 
too late, that is, to cause much harm or do much good.

A LONDON CRITIC LOOKS AT L. A. THEATER; 
</P>
<P>
THE VIEW FROM LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scope of the problem first hit me one afternoon when I lost my way in 
Earl's Court. Stopping a friendly looking East Pakistani, I asked: "Pardon me, 
sir, but is this the way to the Royal Shakespeare Company?" 
</P>
<P>
"What is this Shakespeare?" he replied. 
</P>
<P>
And I had my lead. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, all right -- I made up the Pakistani. But the incident certainly could have 
happened. Every great metropolitan center these days contains a good many 
people from Karachi, Erithrea, Glendale and Stoke-on-Trent who don't know 
anything about theater. This doesn't preclude the possibility that the city 
also contains a large, intelligent and interested theater audience. 
</P>
<P>
The anecdote with which John Peter begins his adjoining impressions of the Los 
Angeles theater scene is therefore beside the point -- in terms of logic. If 
the city demonstrates "a huge appetite for live theater," what is the point of 
beginning with a story about a man from Ethiopia who doesn't know what a 
theater is? 
</P>
<P>
Because it strikes the note -- unconsciously, I think: Peter seems to want to 
make this a friendly piece -- that, in terms of theater culture, Los Angeles is 
still an undeveloped nation. 
</P>
<P>
We are used to hearing this from New York critics, who won't have their city 
displaced as the center of the American theater. London critics, however, don't 
have any particular axe to grind about the West Coast. In fact, they love to 
come here. If this London critic finds our theater disappointing, we ought to 
look at that. 
</P>
<P>
The other alternative is to get defensive. The guy admits he only saw half a 
dozen shows here -- including the Taper's roundly panned "Dutch Landscape." 
What kind of a sample universe is that? What if he had seen Lillian Garrett's 
beautifully modulated production of "The Day You'll Love Me" at Taper, Too? 
What if he had seen Nan Martin and Alan Mandell in "The Road to Mecca" at South 
Coast Repertory? His report might have been different. 
</P>
<P>
True. But Peter wasn't doing a white paper on Los Angeles theater. He was asked 
to give his impressions of it. Half a dozen shows do generate some impressions. 
Our question ought to be whether his were off the mark, or grounded in reality. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Peter liked the design work that he saw better than the direction. 
My reaction would be that Los Angeles theater design is generally on a high 
level, at least in the bigger houses. But since the director has considerable 
to say about design, a good set is partly to his credit -- not a sign that he 
has been outpointed by his design team. 
</P>
<P>
There's also the question of how much higher a director can go than his text. 
Given these scripts, any director would have been hard put to find an inner 
life for the Taper's "Dutch Landscape" or the Los Angeles Theatre Center's 
"Stars in the Morning Sky." How would one play the former except as soap opera, 
or the latter except as opera? 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say that either play was faultlessly cast or thrillingly paced. 
(The first was staged by the Taper's Gordon Davidson, the second by LATC's Bill 
Bushnell.) But the basic problem was the selection of the script. Peter's real 
quarrel here was with Davidson and Bushnell as artistic directors, not as 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
What about Peter's finding that Los Angeles directors fail to make the 
connection between "the interior life of the characters and the physical 
movement of the action"? Sometimes true, usually not true. 
</P>
<P>
SCR's "The Road to Mecca," for example, is a much more dynamic production than 
the one staged by author Athol Fugard in New York last season, without being 
any the less intelligent or well-spoken. Watch how Nan Martin translates an old 
woman's need to feel helpful into a process of endlessly roving about the 
stage, as if haunted by a dybbuk. We can surely infer some input here from 
director Martin Benson. 
</P>
<P>
What about Peter's charge that famous American actors like Dustin Hoffman -- 
the kind of actor who could bring big crowds to Los Angeles theater -- stay 
away from the big classical roles because they don't have confidence in 
American directors? 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, this is less true today than it was 25 years ago, when a star American 
director like Elia Kazan could admit (privately anyway) that he didn't give a 
damn about staging the classics and didn't have the background for it. 
</P>
<P>
The resident theater movement has taken the terror out of Ibsen, Sheridan and 
Shakespeare for American theater people and audiences alike. Kevin Kline, for 
example -- one of the actors whom Peter wants to lure back to the theater -- 
wasn't afraid to do "Much Ado About Nothing" under Gerald Freedman's direction 
for the New York Shakespeare Festival last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Not in Los Angeles, though. There wouldn't have been any psychic profit for 
Kline in that. And here, one echoes Peter's puzzled question: "Why is New York 
supposed to be the theatrical capital of America?" 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it's a question of mythologies. L.A. is film. N.Y. is stage. Something 
in the American unconscious doesn't want them to meet, and doesn't believe them 
when they do meet. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Chamberlain did a glorious "Cyrano de Bergerac" under Joseph Hardy's 
direction in '72 at the Ahmanson Theatre, just as dazzling and far more moving 
than Derek Jacobi's "Cyrano" at the RSC -- but it wasn't as real as if he'd 
done it in London or New York, because everybody knows that there isn't any 
theater in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It's a vicious circle, but it is starting to dissolve. What we need now is more 
respect for theater within our film/TV industry -- the kind that allows someone 
doing a play at LATC to get off the set at Universal by 5 p.m. without fail -- 
and more confidence in the theater community that our theater is the real 
thing, able to stand up to the toughest scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Visits from scrutinizers like Peter can only help. All we have to do is 
separate the substance from the rhetoric.

A LONDON CRITIC LOOKS AT L. A. THEATER; 
</P>
<P>
THE VIEW FROM THE WEST END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PETER, John Peter, chief drama critic of the Sunday Times of London, 
spent the month of January watching theater on the West Coast. Calendar asked 
him his impressions of the Los Angeles theater scene. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The size of the problem first hit me when a man gave me a lift from Malibu to 
downtown Los Angeles. I told him I wanted to go to the Los Angeles Theatre 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles center," he repeated. He was an Ethiopian from Erithrea. He had 
lived here for three years. He knew Los Angeles well. "No," I said, "Los 
Angeles Theatre Center." "Yes," he said, "Los Angeles center." "Theatre 
Center," I said. There was a puzzled silence. It turned out that he did not 
know what a theater was. 
</P>
<P>
I had never come across such a thing before. I had met people who thought that 
the theater was the pastime of the idle rich; people who thought it was a 
breeding ground of Communists, homosexuals and freaky subversives; people who 
thought it was the scene of religious or political experience; people who 
thought it was where you went for a good laugh and chocolates in noisy wrapping 
paper. I had never met anyone who did not know what the theater was. 
</P>
<P>
I tried to explain. I said, I think, that the theater was like a TV series but 
bigger, and that it was like movies where the actors were real. I knew all the 
time that this was ridiculous: The theater differs crucially from both films 
and television in that a stage play fully exists only when it is played live, 
and that it can only be played live or it is not theater. But actually, these 
are quite sophisticated notions. How do you explain the reality of live 
impersonation to someone who is a stranger to the practice? 
</P>
<P>
The point of all this is that the population of one of the largest and most 
sophisticated conurbations of the Western world includes people who know 
nothing about theater. Moreover, this conurbation contains the homes, 
workplaces, playgrounds and killing fields of some of the most famous as well 
as some of the best acting talent in the Western world. In other words, theater 
in Los Angeles is full of paradoxes. 
</P>
<P>
Now it may be foolhardy to generalize on the basis of a short stay; but I was 
struck, on my few visits to theaters here, how much better theater design is 
than theater direction. 
</P>
<P>
The set of "Stars in the Morning Sky," at the LATC, was designed with a 
combination of realism and expressionistic grandeur that is characteristic of 
the play; but the cast almost entirely missed its flavor. "Ladies Room," at the 
Tiffany, is one of the crassest and most insulting plays about female sexuality 
I have ever seen, and the acting had a rough crassness to match; but the set 
was put together with loving accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
So, is there a shortage of good directors in Los Angeles? Or is it simply that 
they are not interested in the way the feelings and thoughts of characters 
express themselves in the speeding up or slowing down of the action? The half a 
dozen plays I have seen here may not have been representative, but they all had 
in common a lack of dramatic rhythm and pace. 
</P>
<P>
David Rabe's "Hurlyburly," a two-act play that spreads itself ponderously over 
three acts, was directed by its author like a slow train: It chugged across all 
kinds of emotional terrain with the same heavy amble. "Dutch Landscape," at the 
Mark Taper, matched the verbal flab of the text with a performance full of 
unfocused soap-opera emotion: A kind of aimless theatrical Jacuzzi. 
</P>
<P>
The point is that if you miss the link between the interior life of your 
characters and the physical movement of the action, you have no grasp of the 
most vital element in the dynamics of your play. The text should play as it 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is rooted in a number of causes, all interconnected. Where does one 
begin? I find that American audiences are apprehensive of the great European 
classics, largely because they do not know them; and that they do not know them 
because they are apprehensive of them. Producers are scared to put them on. Who 
will come to see Ibsen's "Ghosts" unless you can get famous stars to play the 
leading roles? But the problem is that famous star actors in America are by 
definition film actors. How can you tempt them to play Ibsen or Chekhov if it 
means reducing their earnings for months on end? 
</P>
<P>
I come to this problem with British perceptions. In England, most top actors 
(though admittedly not all) would jump at the chance to play the top classical 
roles from Shakespeare to Tennessee Williams. But then, they know that they 
would mostly be directed by people who could be counted on to bring the best 
out of them and out of the play. 
</P>
<P>
Compare this with the United States. It is four years since Dustin Hoffman 
played his famous Willy Loman, directed by the brilliant expatriate American 
Michael Rudman; this year he is to play Shakespeare's Shylock -- but in England 
under Sir Peter Hall. Would he do more theater in America if he could work for 
such directors? 
</P>
<P>
The point is that in England we have many such directors, steeped in old 
traditions, because there is a demand for all kinds of theater. The tradition 
breeds the directors; the directors keep alive the tradition. No one is afraid 
of Virginia Woolf; no one is afraid of Ibsen. We are back where we started. 
</P>
<P>
All this seems rather unfair on American actors; but the problem in Los Angeles 
has a particular irony. I am told that there were more than 200 openings in the 
city last year, so there is clearly a huge appetite for live theater. Moreover, 
over the Hollywood Hills, there are men and women acting away in films who 
could between them fill all the stages in the Music Center all the year round. 
</P>
<P>
Why don't they? Is it greed? Would it hurt that much to earn a little less for 
three months or so? Is it the fear of exposing on the live stage a talent that 
is accustomed to being used in short takes? Is it indifference? 
</P>
<P>
Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline and William Hurt, for example, seem to me among the 
most brilliant and versatile talents to have come forward in recent years. All 
of them were trained in the live theater, and their film work bears all the 
signs of an artistic intelligence nourished on the live stage where the actor's 
body and mind engage with the role and with other actors and other roles, 
continuously, without retakes. 
</P>
<P>
It is this constant engagement that gives stage acting its thrilling sense of 
danger; and when I watch Streep, Kline or Hurt on the screen, I think I can 
tell that their art was shaped and refined by the danger and absorption of live 
stage performances. And yet how often have these actors returned to the 
theater? 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is the problem of New York. Why is it supposed to be the 
theatrical capital of America? Its standards seem to me increasingly 
unremarkable, almost provincial; its audiences and producers have become so 
timorous that they can be cowed by the opinion of one newspaper. So why is it 
still so important to be on Broadway? Why should not the heart of American 
theater be in Los Angeles where most of its finest actors live or work? 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons why the standards of American stage acting in general are 
not as high as they might be is that the ordinary actor hardly ever has the 
chance to work on-stage with the leaders of his profession. 
</P>
<P>
What better place for this to happen than Los Angeles? I know that a country 
the size of the United States cannot really have a national theater like 
England or France; and I know, too, that Americans have inherited the strong 
British suspicion of national cultural institutions. But something really 
exciting and unique could happen in Los Angeles if someone had the generosity 
to make it happen, and the vision, and the courage.

MEMORABLE MOVIES THAT DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT AT THE ACADEMY NOMINATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the official slate of Academy Award nominations announced, a lid was shut 
on the film year of 1989. Movie lovers of the future will squint at these 
lists, whittled down further by the awards themselves on the 29th of March, to 
get the shape of the year cinematically. 
</P>
<P>
So, before the films that didn't make the cut fade away entirely, before they 
go into the video vault and emerge with a little something ineffable missing, 
let us remember a handful of the special ones a final time, commend them to 
memory like a filmic "Farenheit 451" so that we stretch out their time with us 
a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
From the murmurs I've heard around, there are more than a few people wistful 
that Reizl Bozyk wasn't nominated in the Best Supporting Actress category. It's 
always fun when, in all cheerful naivete, American movies "discover" a 
performer who's been an open secret in another country or in the theater -- 
which might as well be another country to most Americans. Those who fall into 
this category this year include: Klaus Maria Brandauer (back this year in the 
foreign film nominee, "Hanussen"); Alan Rickman, "Die Hard's" suave villain; 
last year's big noise, Olympia Dukakis (who has one scene in "Working Girl"); 
and the Yiddish theater's Bozyk, who wrapped up "Crossing Delancey" and tucked 
it into her apron pocket. 
</P>
<P>
There are favorite scenes and favorite scenes in "Crossing Delancey" between 
Bozyk as this sturdy grandmother and Amy Irving as her adoring granddaughter. 
One of my own is the self-defense class, which pairs off a dozen or so of these 
feisty Lower East Side bubbies, practicing being victim and attacker. Heaven 
help the misguided purse-snatcher who mugs one of these one-woman burglar 
alarms; he'll deserve what he gets. Bozyk is sparrow-bright and not what you 
might call unschooled in matters of scene-stealing, yet her heart seems as vast 
as her craft and her creation of a universal, nurturing grandmother (Jewish has 
only a little to do with it) is a classic. 
</P>
<P>
That supporting actress category this year was a melee; there were probably 
more deserving performers left out at the cut here than in any other group. 
Apparently, not enough Academy members got to see the year's only bona fide 
sleeper, "Bagdad Cafe," writer-director Percy Adlon's off-beat observations 
about the triumphs of tenacity. If they had, you might have expected a 
nomination for Marianne Sagebrecht, one of its two electrifying stars.

Fortunately, the music branch was alert to the film and because of the 
nomination of its haunting song, "Calling You," (one of only three selected 
this year) "Bagdad Cafe" will turn up again during the membership screenings. 
Voters can then see what they overlooked, although Sagebrecht's unique and 
delicate comedic talent may yet have its day, since she and Adlon are finishing 
a third film together right now, "Rosalie Goes Shopping" for which Bob Telson 
will again do the music. 
</P>
<P>
In its gentle, uninsistent way, "Bagdad Cafe" is about communication among 
strangers and about finding and building on one's bedrock talents, no matter 
how humble. Affluent Austrian traveler Sagebrecht (whom some may remember as 
the love-besotted star of "Sugarbaby") is stranded in the Mojave desert; she 
speaks no English, through a suitcase mix-up she has only her husband's clothes 
and, seemingly, her only useful talent is for cleaning and orderliness. From 
those simple-enough beginnings, she creates magic, spreading a bounteous and 
enveloping warmth and love around her. CCH Pounder, her co-star, is formidable 
as the stressed-out young grandmother who owns the Godforsaken motel where 
Sagebrecht lands. But, the tremulous delicacy and inventiveness of performance 
artist Sagebrecht, making love bloom in the desert, is the film's most powerful 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
Among the notable errors of omission this year was "Dead Ringers," which failed 
to show in any category -- not even its profligately beautiful art direction or 
its seamless special effects. It's another hint that anything un-cheerful may 
have a rough time of it today, and David Cronenberg's exploration of the darker 
recesses of twin souls was far from light. But the non-nomination of Jeremy 
Irons' dual performance is the real shocker. Perhaps he did it with too much 
ease, with a brilliance that was almost offhand, creating two identities so 
subtly and so surely that without clues from clothes or haircuts, that only 
from seeing the face or the body of one of his twin doctors, you knew which 
brother you had before you. 
</P>
<P>
In another case of avoidance of serious subjects, the complete shutout of "A 
World Apart" left three exceptional performances unnoticed, as well as the 
direction of Chris Menges and the screenplay of Shawn Slobo, writing with 
eloquence about South Africa and her murdered mother, Ruth First. Barbara 
Hershey as the indomitable First, called Diana Roth in the screenplay, the 
first white woman jailed under South Africa's infamous 90-day detention law, 
was perhaps not a showy enough role for the taste of the voters. (Or, 
pragmatically, perhaps the fact that, like "Bagdad Cafe," it was not a widely 
screened film during "for your consideration" time had something crucial to do 
with its fate.) But it was a brilliant, controlled and biting performance, 
another in the growing sequence of achievements by Hershey. 
</P>
<P>
Johdi May, who played her daughter, Molly, was another of those bitter 
disappointments among no-show supporting actress nominations. Sweet-shy, 
translucently true, May's slow maturing from sheltered little girl to 
clear-eyed knowledgeable teen-ager was exquisitely calibrated. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, "A World Apart" had Linda Mvusi, as the Roth family housekeeper, 
second-mother to the lonely Molly and one of her conduits to understanding the 
real horrors of life in one of South Africa's segregated townships. It is 
perhaps a tribute to director Menges that Mvusi, a working architect in 
Zimbabwe, who unlike young Jodhi May, had no acting training before this film, 
was as wrenchingly effective as she was as the sister of a young slain African 
National Congress leader. 
</P>
<P>
Like Reizl Bozyk, Barnard Hughes went beyond the stereotype of "the Irish 
father" to create a parent everyone could identify with in "Da." Garrulous, a 
master of platitudes, a political Neanderthal and a barroom blowhard, this is 
the sort of father you honor because you must, but whose biggest roadblock to 
letting himself be loved is the man himself. What gave the film its undeniable 
tug were the complexities with which Hughes colored this dear, trying man -- 
that and the marvelous interplay between Hughes and Martin Sheen as his 
exasperated Americanized son, left struggling to sort out his emotions about 
his "da." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps "Bird's" single nomination (for sound), a shameful omission on any 
number of other levels, will at least spotlight the sweet power of Forest 
Whitaker's Charlie Parker and the utter fascination of Diane Venora as Chan. 
The meeting of these two was one of 1988's high points of subliminal erotic 
tension, along with the triangle set up by Keith Carradine, Linda Fiorentino 
and John Lone in "The Moderns." It's as sad that Christine Lahti's 
magnificently moving performance as the ex-activist mother in "Running on 
Empty" went ignored as it is appalling that its imprecise and superficial 
screenplay was nominated. (Over the screenplay of "Bagdad Cafe," or "Married to 
the Mob," over "Punchline," or "Working Girl"? Please!) 
</P>
<P>
There's one reference point to use in considering this year's list of 
nominations: David Lean's restored "Lawrence of Arabia." It's the hottest 
ticket on both coasts. When you can get in, you hear more talk about its 
freshness, its grandeur than a single other film in recent memory -- and that, 
despite the fact of its serious subject and its all-male cast, two of today's 
supposed anathemas. Which movie from 1988 can you possibly imagine resurrected 
or even watched, 27 years down the line? A film if not of grandeur, at least of 
authoritative inventiveness? You might put your money on "Who Framed Roger 
Rabbit."

THE SWAMI OF SCRIPTS; 
</P>
<P>
ROBERT MCKEE HAS TURNED A WAY WITH STORYTELLING AND SOME SELF-PROMOTION INTO AN 
EDUCATIONAL INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"On the first day of class, they look like stunned mullets. I mean, they don't 
know what hit them. 
</P>
<P>
"On the second day, depression sets in -- when they realize how hard it is. And 
then on the third day, I give 'em a shot in the arm, inspire them, because 
screenwriting is the most difficult writing form of all -- because there is no 
place to hide." 
</P>
<P>
And then Robert McKee -- businessman, master teacher, the swami of scripts -- 
breaks into a hearty laugh at the strangeness of it all: "All I wanted when I 
came out here -- as if this wasn't enough -- was to write and direct my own 
screenplays." 
</P>
<P>
McKee, 47, lives in an art-filled, 24th-floor apartment on the Westside. After 
welcoming a reporter, the one-time stage actor and director, studio story 
analyst and TV series writer lights up the first of many cigarettes and 
explains how he became one of the world's most successful screenwriting 
teachers, how he can jet to New York and Chicago, to London and Auckland, to 
teach a modern world the ancient art of storytelling. It is a seamless 
narrative; he has told the story often. 
</P>
<P>
This being Hollywood, McKee isn't shy about self-promotion: "I believe that 
this course I teach stands head and shoulders above the rest. This course has 
grown into such a phenomenon worldwide, the kind of quality of people who take 
the course -- Academy Award winners, all kinds of executives as well as writers 
-- has made me feel that what I do is very valuable, that it really makes a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
McKee's "Story Structure" class does attract a lot of industry attention; more 
than half the students at his seminars work in television or film. The class 
brochure is embellished with testimonials from celebrities who have taken it -- 
director Mark Rydell, producer Gene Reynolds, even former Ms. magazine 
publisher Gloria Steinem. McKee proudly displays a letter from Jack Valenti, 
president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, enrolling in a recent 
seminar. 
</P>
<P>
And, noting others have also "seen the possibilities of this," McKee asks that 
he not be "bunched into an article about a survey of screenwriting gurus." 
</P>
<P>
(McKee has certainly mastered the "possibilities": He teaches monthly in Los 
Angeles, four times a year in New York and three times a year in London as well 
as classes in other major cities around the world. At $300 a pop, McKee expects 
to teach 2,000 students this year, enough to support three full-time staff 
members as well as some part-timers, and to maintain offices here and in New 
York. He also offers personal script consultations for $1,000, as well as 
consultation to film studios and networks. "My accountant points out that I 
make a very nice living," McKee said, "but there's a lot of overhead too.") 
</P>
<P>
After earning a master's in drama at the University of Michigan, McKee -- who 
is the father of two children and is separated from his wife -- moved to New 
York, eventually directing about 60 plays as well as acting in Off-Broadway, 
repertory and summer stock productions. After seven years of the gypsy theater 
life, McKee went back to the University of Michigan to get a doctoral degree 
that "would be something I could take to Hollywood, something that would 
enhance my work when I got out there." His thesis became the underpinning of 
"Story Structure." 
</P>
<P>
He came west in 1979, first teaching at San Diego State University, then 
becoming a story analyst at United Artists and NBC, but his ambition was to be 
a film director. He turned to screenwriting when he couldn't get anyone to hire 
him to direct -- "I discovered that to make it in Hollywood, you have to write 
your own screenplay." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, McKee sold his first script, to AVCO/Embassy, and has had eight 
feature film screenplays purchased or optioned since then. Only one, "Madness," 
is currently in active development, with a small Italian company, Serio 
International. He also wrote scripts for TV "cop shows and like that, making a 
living as a writer, somehow, between the options and the TV. While I was 
waiting for one of these (feature) screenplays to strike gold -- to get to the 
screen, so I can twist the arms of Hollywood on the second one and get to 
direct -- I was invited to teach at Sherwood Oaks Experimental College." 
</P>
<P>
It was McKee's experience as a story analyst that set the subject matter at 
Sherwood Oaks (no longer in existence). "When I got out here, as a story 
analyst, I thought, 'Everyone understands story' -- until I started to read. 
And then I discovered what everyone knows is true, that 99 out of a 100 
screenplays are terribly told. And then I found out the reality of Hollywood: 
Over the past 20 years the whole craft, the fundamental understanding of the 
craft of storytelling, has rapidly gone downhill. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew this course had to be about story structure, that it would be a waste 
of time to be talking about the refinements of style, of dialogue, of 
characterization, the screenplay's surface." 
</P>
<P>
McKee -- who says that "in the '30s and '40s, even the worst B movie had a good 
story" -- blames the loss of good storytelling craft on three factors: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The end of the studio system, in which writers were handled by "real story 
editors, most of them anonymous, most of them women, who really knew structure" 
and who had the time to educate, to apprentice a writer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The shift in emphasis at universities from teaching the "inner life of a 
story -- deep character, the powerful controlling idea -- to textural analysis. 
The deep structures of storytelling became an embarrassment to the scholar; 
they forgot that structure is more important than anything; it's the grand 
form, it contains the deepest, most powerful choices the artist makes, the most 
powerful expression of their vision." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The time we live in. Because everyone is confused about values, "there's 
this tremendous subjectivization, relativization of values . . . consequently 
there's a great confusion in the minds of writers about what to write about, 
what is meaningful . . . a disintegration of understanding about values," 
values that are at the heart of storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
McKee, looking very professorial in sweater and slacks, enters Lucas Building 
Theatre 108 at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty students -- pros and amateurs, studio executives and underlings, actors 
and wanna-be's -- lean forward, seriously checking him out, each wondering if 
the teacher is as good as advertised, wondering if they should have spent the 
$300 tuition fee on a weekend in Mazatlan. 
</P>
<P>
McKee wins over the most skeptical. He's a performer as well as a master 
teacher who, in 20 hours over three days, will attempt to teach them the 
complex art of writing a simple story, well-told. 
</P>
<P>
And -- no surprise -- the Gospel According to McKee starts with story 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
"I make it real clear in the first hour: This course is not about formula. You 
cannot take the greatest, most mysterious art form there is and reduce it to a 
formula -- that's absurd. There is 
</P>
<P>
such a thing as form -- when that form is present we instinctively react to it. 
That response can be to 'Tender Mercies' or to 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' When 
you come out, you go, 'What a good story.' You react to it. You have been 
touched by a form, worked through a form, satisfied intellectually and 
emotionally by the great form of that story." 
</P>
<P>
McKee gets most passionate when emphasizing the prominence of classic story 
structure to the class, the need for a powerful "controlling idea" -- the "one 
clear sentence that distills the essence of the film" -- to drive the story. 
</P>
<P>
The essence of good story is unchanging and universal: McKee's students must 
learn classic story structure because "everything works in the shadow of it. If 
you want to write minimalistic or anti-structure then you must know the grand 
form first." Classic structure "works, this has worked since Homer; these are 
the functions of story, the particular way you make it work is your problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Structure is not some simplistic form of beginnings, middles and ends. It's a 
very clear, deep understanding for the writer of the metaphors for life, an 
exploration of the craft of writing as it echoes in their life -- stories are a 
metaphor for life." 
</P>
<P>
He gets in a dig at his teaching rival, Syd Field, saying Field's book, 
"Screenplay," has "done more harm than good. . . . Field's book says, 'You too 
can be a hack.' " 
</P>
<P>
(Field, in a phone interview, retorts: "McKee says I teach people to write by 
the numbers -- for me, story structure is flexible, the tree that bends but 
will not break. When I write that a plot point should occur between page 25 and 
27, that depends on the film; it could just as easily come at page 18 or 35. 
</P>
<P>
("I get a lot of people in my classes who have taken his class and who don't 
know how to write a screenplay.") 
</P>
<P>
McKee plays to the student writers' egos, telling them that everything starts 
with the writer, the story: "It's the most difficult time to be a writer, also 
the most challenging. A writer, cast on their own, really has to be wise, to 
come to a deep understanding of their values, to make an original exploration 
of what life really means. It's not a given anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot hide behind language (like in the novel or theater). A screenwriter 
. . . cannot manipulate perception; screenwriters are hanging bare-naked and 
the camera sees through every flaw." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Kleeman, 24, a junior executive at a major studio who calls himself "an 
apprentice in the industry," says that the USC seminar "is a great starting 
point. McKee is very articulate, charming, he schematized class in a very 
intelligent if somewhat closed system. My guess is that if he were a studio 
executive he would never give the green light to a bad script but might pass on 
a good script that didn't fit into his format. Part of McKee's charm is his 
arrogance, which ruled out most dialogue with the students." 
</P>
<P>
Another student at the USC seminar, Marsha Bentley Hale, 36, a film archivist 
"for a major director," said the seminar "gave me insight into structure and 
form, things that were helpful to me. Something that he said 'clicked' with me, 
was very helpful to a teleplay (script for a theme park attraction) that I'm 
working on." 
</P>
<P>
McKee doesn't promise a pot of gold waiting at the end of the course, and 
repeatedly hammers home that it won't be easy, that the students will have to 
dig deep within themselves to produce a quality script: "One fine service this 
course may do is to make it very clear to would-be's as to what a very 
difficult tightrope they have stepped upon, that it's going to take a 
tremendous amount of skill, craft to get from one end to the other. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I save a lot of people a lot of time -- it'll take you five 
screenplays to figure out how to write a screenplay." 
</P>
<P>
While "Story Structure" may pay the bills, McKee keeps pounding away at 
Hollywood through his production company, Two Arts Productions. He began 
working with 10 of his students to produce scripts that he could market to 
Hollywood. "A few years ago, I opened workshops beyond the class. Getting very 
frustrated that screenplays I sold or had optioned got into pre-production and 
then didn't make it to the screen -- I decided to use my expertise as a story 
editor, to take the best author development contracts to the best of these 
young writers. 
</P>
<P>
"So I gave them contracts, to add to their work a lot of my own creative 
contributions -- wanting nothing in terms of their money -- to see if I could 
get them into production. A horror film is finished, a beautiful piece by Doug 
Erickson called 'Mirror, Mirror' getting very nice coverage around town 
(Erickson says "Mirror" was not optioned, but purchased outright by McKee's 
production company); out of the 10 that I drew, four, maybe five, became viable 
screenplays and two of them, possibly a third, will get produced." 
</P>
<P>
The payoff for him? "Hopefully, I'll direct them." And, there will be the 
financial reward for Two Arts when and if the projects are picked up by a film 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
And if that doesn't work out, there's still his writing. "Meanwhile, my 
screenplays are doing very well. I've just finished a project called 'Madness' 
in co-production with Serio International of Rome; I will direct that. That was 
through my development company with one of my development writers, Mike 
Gonzalez (Gonzalez and McKee share co-writing credit). And one of my own called 
'Miss Julie' -- I have a deal with Zev Braun (Productions) to direct that, I'm 
polishing that." (Braun, who took McKee's seminar -- 'It's the real thing, 
digging into making a complete script, not patching one together' -- says 'Miss 
Julie' is in active development.) 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not alone in this experience of continually selling your own screenplays, 
losing the roll of the dice," McKee said. "This town is full of people like 
myself, who sell consistently, but have a hard time getting produced -- just 
bad luck. The studios typically option 95 scripts for every five they produce, 
so it's not unusual to find someone in my situation, taking eight years to 
finally get it to the screen." 
</P>
<P>
McKee gets a little defensive about his cash flow: "In teaching this class over 
the years, despite the success and the money making, the truth of the matter is 
that I could have probably made a lot more money writing television episodes 
with one-fifth of the work. (McKee has sold seven episodes of one-hour shows, 
including "Columbo" and "Quincy," and the short-lived "Double Dare" and "Eye to 
Eye.") 
</P>
<P>
"There are all kinds of ways to look at what I do, but the people who have 
taken the course know that I take that enterprise very seriously, that I am 
trying to make us all appreciate the great difficulty and great importance of 
what we do. No matter what it's done for me personally, I don't do it for me 
personally -- I already know the stuff. I do it because I love it, it's great 
fun for me, the last vestige of an old actor, to hold these people for a 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't pretend for a moment that this will send a person to the typewriter 
and tell them how to write a story. What they get out of this course is, 
inevitably, a list of questions with knowledge behind them. They can sit down 
with their own material and ask, 'Why doesn't this thing work?' and find the 
answers to those questions. 
</P>
<P>
"They come out with questions and enough knowledge to be able to find their own 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's what I do."

Pools and Spas was bankrupt. Actually, the Garden Grove company, which made the 
spa in which a 10-year-old boy was paralyzed when he was sucked to the bottom, 
is now out of business and was not a party to the settlement. The company was 
sold in 1984 to Earl Dexter Corp., which now operates the business as Blue

GHERKINS SURVIVE CAREER PICKLE, SEEK FAME; 
</P>
<P>
RAUCOUS ORANGE COUNTY BAND HOPES THAT MOCKING METAL WILL PROVE A DILLY OF A 
SUCCESSFUL SHTICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Leveque is a free-lance writer living in Lindenwold, N.J. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the outset, Gherkin Raucous was a band designed to make an immediate 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
There was, for starters, the name: How many rock groups are named after a 
variety of pickle? 
</P>
<P>
The band's pedigree was certainly in order: All four Gherkins had previously 
played in bands that had built followings in the Orange County rock scene. 
</P>
<P>
The sound? A proven crowd-grabber: heavy metal with booming beats, 
authoritative banshee-wail vocals and mercurial guitar solos. 
</P>
<P>
The band's best quality was its impish attitude. While walloping away with 
crunching, Led Zeppelin-style metal, the aim of Gherkin Raucous was to ridicule 
the genre's bombastic stage conventions by carrying them to comic extremes. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Darren McNamee might copy some macho-man poses from the David Lee Roth 
manual of metal-arts, but he would undercut them with farcical facial 
expressions more befitting Pee-wee Herman or Monty Python slapstick. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Warren Fitzgerald eschewed the grave, titanic manner favored by most 
metal musicians. Instead, he played the part of a scamp, engaging, at some 
personal risk, in impromptu, madcap acrobatics that raised the possibility of a 
Gherkin Raucous performance taking an unscripted detour to the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
But by the end of 1988, after having established its popularity on the Orange 
County/Long Beach club circuit, Gherkin Raucous was ready to give up. It had 
not made an impression where it counts most: among the Los Angeles-based record 
executives who decide whether a band will be signed to a label and heard by the 
world at large. 
</P>
<P>
Disheartened by several years of unsuccessful striving, drummer Miles Gillett 
announced that he was going back to his native New Zealand to start over in the 
burgeoning rock scene Down Under. The other members -- McNamee, Fitzgerald and 
bassist Dan Wallis -- didn't want to go on without Gillett, so on Dec. 17, 
Gherkin Raucous headlined at Night Moves in Huntington Beach in what was billed 
as the band's farewell show. 
</P>
<P>
Without ever having had a real whirl at the record business or a go-round of 
showcases for record company talent scouts, Gherkin was turning into a pumpkin. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned, out, though, Gherkin Raucous had a fairy godmother. 
</P>
<P>
More precisely, it had a late-emerging benefactor named Don Muller from Triad 
Artists, one of the major booking agencies in Los Angeles. Just as Gherkin 
Raucous was breaking up, Muller stepped forward with the sort of insider 
connections that the band had never mustered. 
</P>
<P>
Muller, who has already orchestrated one Hollywood showcase concert for Gherkin 
Raucous, said he will set up others and will help guide the group as it 
continues to take its shot. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody has waved a magic wand of guaranteed success over the band, but it 
appears as if Gherkin Raucous will at least get a full chance to be heard and 
to find out whether the slipper fits. 
</P>
<P>
It was late in 1987 that members of three different county bands decided that 
they made a good fit and started Gherkin Raucous. Fitzgerald, 20, and Wallis, 
23 -- old school friends from Huntington Beach -- had been playing together in 
the funk-rock band Double Freak. Gillett, 25, came from the locally popular El 
Grupo Sexo. McNamee, 23, was recruited from a band called Electric Kool Aid on 
the strength of his eccentric approach to performance. 
</P>
<P>
Gherkin Raucous got its name from Fitzgerald's eccentric approach to 
Thanksgiving dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw these little things that looked like green slugs," the guitarist 
recalled recently at a Garden Grove warehouse honeycombed with rehearsal 
studios for rock bands. "My dad said they were gherkins. I was fascinated by 
them. I was staring at them and playing with them the whole night." 
</P>
<P>
While Fitzgerald and the other members of Gherkin Raucous spoke, noisy blasts 
from the sort of earnest, fashion-conscious heavy-metal bands they're out to 
spoof intruded from neighboring cubicles. 
</P>
<P>
"Gherkin" became a favorite word for Fitzgerald, a silly inside joke. The band 
paired it with "raucous," long a favorite word of Gillett's, and the band had a 
name to match its aims. 
</P>
<P>
McNamee's aims did not have much to do with rock music when he began singing in 
bands at UC Irvine on his way to a bachelor's degree in chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
"I just did it for fun," he said, in staccato-speaking cadences. "I'm pretty 
uninhibited. I'll do just about anything if it's something I'll get off on." 
</P>
<P>
Then again, next to Fitzgerald, he is only a mild eccentric. In the course of a 
concert, the bantam-size guitarist will wander from the stage, clamber on 
railings and table tops and more or less behave like a heedless, dangerously 
hyperactive tot, flailing all the while at one of his cordless electric 
guitars. Sometimes Fitzgerald breaks objects or falls. It's a bruising method 
of performance -- for himself and anyone who happens to be in the way. 
</P>
<P>
McNamee began ticking off the hazards of sharing a stage with Fitzgerald, who 
"hit me in the face when he was wearing a helmet, dragged me across glass that 
he'd broken." 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm hurt after a show, I feel like I did something right," Fitzgerald said. 
"I love to play music, so if I die while I'm playing music, that would be a 
statement in itself." 
</P>
<P>
Emerging last spring, Gherkin Raucous quickly established a following at Night 
Moves and Bogart's, but it lacked a focused plan for generating a buzz in the 
record industry. Early on, the band assumed that a contact at Geffen Records 
would lead to a record deal, but nothing materialized. 
</P>
<P>
"We were counting our chickens before they hatched," Fitzgerald said. "I think 
we're much wiser now and more realistic." 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest," Gillett said, "we got a little lazy" about doing the legwork to 
generate label interest. 
</P>
<P>
It was Gillett's 2-week rest-and-relaxation trip back to New Zealand in 
September that nearly finished the band. The affable, round-faced drummer, who 
had moved to California when he was 10, fell in love with his native land and 
decided he wanted to return and build a career from a base Down Under. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the experiment gave Gillett more enthusiasm for making Gherkin 
Raucous a success: "If Gherkin gets signed, I can buy property in New Zealand, 
and I could commute back and forth. I had this big rock star kind of dream." 
</P>
<P>
But instead, Gillett was confronted by one of the harsher realities of life as 
a struggling, impecunious rocker, one that's particularly harsh in a high-rent 
district such as Orange County: He got evicted from his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting in bed one night, just radically depressed," he recalled. "I 
said, 'What am I doing? I'm going to be back on the street again.' I wanted 
just a radically different life style." 
</P>
<P>
He decided to find it in New Zealand, as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The other members of Gherkin Raucous said there was disappointment but no 
hostility over Gillett's decision. "We're not living too high right now," 
McNamee said, "and he had a chance to go and live well, live with his family. 
We understood." 
</P>
<P>
But another harsh reality of being an impecunious, struggling rocker is that 
you can't just pack up and hop the next plane to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like an idiot, telling people I'm taking off, and I wasn't ready to 
leave yet," Gillett said. He would have to stay and save for his passage, and 
in the meantime, he told the other members of Gherkin Raucous, he would be open 
to staying with the band if any solid prospects materialized. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Don Muller turned up, taking an interest in a band that the booking 
agent had never seen or heard. 
</P>
<P>
Muller was going by favorable word of mouth generated by promoters with whom he 
routinely did business. David Swinson of Bogart's and Rich Meaney, a longtime 
fan of Fitzgerald who books bands for the Nederlander Organization, were both 
talking up Gherkin Raucous in hope that someone might step in before the group 
broke up. 
</P>
<P>
Gherkin Raucous had already played its farewell concert by the time Muller got 
to hear the band's three-song demo tape. Impressed, he asked whether they would 
be willing to stay together while he used his contacts to help them get a 
record deal. 
</P>
<P>
Most booking agencies make their money by setting up concerts for bands with a 
proven draw. But Muller said he has been trying to forge links for Triad 
Artists with bands on the grass-roots level. 
</P>
<P>
Jane's Addiction and the Rave-Ups are two major-label acts that worked with 
Muller before they were signed to record deals (though in those cases, Muller 
said, his role was confined to getting the bands good local bookings, rather 
than acting as matchmaker between band and record companies, as he is doing 
with Gherkin Raucous). 
</P>
<P>
So far, Muller's relationship with Gherkin Raucous is informal: He'll advise 
the band on career moves, try to set up good bookings and tout them to his 
music business contacts. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, it's what I like to do," Muller said. "There might be something 
that comes from this, and we save the band from breaking up and going away 
before they had a true shot. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, Triad will represent the band if they get a deal. Right now, for 
Triad there's nothing in it. But down the line, they could be huge." 
</P>
<P>
One instant result of Muller's stepping forward: Gillett postponed his 
emigration indefinitely. "I was excited out of my mind," the drummer said. "I 
thought, 'This is it. I've been working all these years at this music bit, and 
I'm finally getting a chance to make it.' " 
</P>
<P>
A late-January showcase at Club Lingerie in Hollywood was the first step. 
Gherkin Raucous played well in the 40-minute set. The tryout atmosphere 
resulted in somewhat less spontaneity than usual (McNamee, for instance, 
confessed that he had to watch his language: "I was thinking of all the things 
I couldn't say"), but Fitzgerald still managed to get pretty physical, banging 
Wallis' bass so hard that he wound up with a lump on his hand. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Muller canvassed the 10 or so industry figures, including scouts for 
four record labels, whom he had invited to the showcase. Most of the comment 
was favorable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody said the band needed more work, more dates, to get them tighter 
together" in their stage act, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Muller said, the plan is to get more live work for Gherkin Raucous, 
perhaps some regional touring. After that, the aim might be more Hollywood 
showcases and possibly an independent record release to give the band a 
tangible credential that might attract big-label interest. 
</P>
<P>
"We're kind of going on faith," Fitzgerald said. "I have faith that someone 
will come along and see something good in us, and take it." 
</P>
<P>
Gherkin Raucous will open for TSOL Saturday at 9 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157 
Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $12.50. Information: (714) 
496-8930.

RANDY LEWIS: FOR THE RECORD, CDS ARE A MUSIC INDUSTRY SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Randy Lewis 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just over 50 years ago, thousands, maybe millions, of Americans tuned in as 
Orson Welles and his Mercury Radio Theater read H.G. Wells' "The War of the 
Worlds" and became completely, hysterically convinced that Earth had been 
invaded by little green men. 
</P>
<P>
We're notorious suckers for hoaxes, a fact that seems somehow reinforced this 
week with news that several Music Plus record stores are dropping vinyl LPs 
entirely, largely because consumers have been so willingly conquered by another 
invading alien: the little silver compact disc. 
</P>
<P>
This is the music industry's great scam of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
I should preface this by saying I find nothing inherently evil about CD 
technology, the way there is with, say, nuclear fission reactors or men's room 
Brut dispensers. 
</P>
<P>
I've never subscribed to that audio-purist school of thinking that the 
digital-recording medium, because it converts sound to a string of numbers that 
is reconstituted as music, irritates the listener on a subliminal psychological 
level. No, Johnny Mathis was doing that years before digital. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the commercial side, which I'll get to shortly, I like the fact that 
a CD theoretically will sound as good on the 1,000th play as it does on the 
first. And I respect the increased dynamic range that CDs can capture: 90 
decibels, compared to 55 decibels maximum on vinyl LPs (us Motorhead fans will 
just have to keep waiting for some newer technology that can handle all 126 
decibels that the "World's Loudest Band" churns out). 
</P>
<P>
And I'll gladly admit to being frustrated at times by LPs' inescapable hisses, 
pops and clicks. There's nothing quite as thrilling as the absolute, dead 
silence of digital, something you notice instantly on the new CD version of 
"The Collected Wisdom of the Reagan Years." 
</P>
<P>
Plus, a CD will last forever, or for the life of the owner, or until record 
companies invent another configuration that's even more profitable, whichever 
comes first. 
</P>
<P>
And there's the rub. The cost. I'd have no problem with CDs if they cost only a 
buck or two more than LPs. 
</P>
<P>
Music Plus officials say they decided to drop LPs from 14 stores because they 
don't chalk up enough sales to make them worth carrying. One store manager said 
he would be doing well if he sold five LPs a week. Under those circumstances, 
dropping the vinyl is just common business sense. 
</P>
<P>
The problem here is that the record-buying public has been flimflammed into 
thinking that vinyl is a four-letter word. 
</P>
<P>
Via the compact disc, the music industry has very cleverly come up with a way 
to entice otherwise sensible people into running to their nearest record store 
-- er, music/video/accessory sales/rental/service center -- to buy recordings 
they already own. And at twice the price. 
</P>
<P>
And you thought those pyramid schemes were crazy? 
</P>
<P>
Compact discs shouldn't cost the $13 or $14 they usually fetch. 
</P>
<P>
Originally they did, because the blank discs themselves cost between $3 and $4 
back in 1983-84. By the time you added in disc mastering, plating, pressing, 
packaging and all the other expensive "ings" that go into compact disc 
manufacturing, like songwriting royalties to the artist, the shiny little 
buggers actually cost $7 to $10 just to press up. 
</P>
<P>
Tack on even a modest profit margin for the record company, the distributor and 
the retailer, and a $15 price tag wasn't particularly excessive here in the 
land of the golden fleeced. 
</P>
<P>
But a lot has changed in the 6 years since CDs hit the market -- except the 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the discs themselves has fallen dramatically, to somewhere between 
75 and 90 cents each -- not much more than the 50 to 60 cents it costs for a 
good blank piece of vinyl. Most of the rest of the costs that go into a CD are 
fairly close to those for records. Furthermore, instead of just a handful of 
high-tech plants that are capable of making CDs, there are dozens, maybe more 
than 100, CD manufacturing plants in the world now. 
</P>
<P>
So why haven't prices come down accordingly? There's some validity in the claim 
that CDs with bonus tracks require higher royalty payments to the artist, whose 
cut is calculated based on the number of songs on the album. 
</P>
<P>
But most CDs, especially in pop music, just duplicate the album song for song. 
And often, they leave out the lyric sheet or some of the artwork that comes 
with the LP. So who's zooming who? 
</P>
<P>
If a record sounds lousy but the same CD sounds great, it's not the record's 
fault. That just means the record company did a lousy job of manufacturing the 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, you have to wonder whether the industry realizes it may be cutting 
off its roots to spite its trunk. Sure, it's a great racket -- for now -- to 
find music lovers willing and able to buy all their favorite old albums on new 
CDs. Heck, you don't even have to promote this stuff -- they're already sold. 
</P>
<P>
But that same money might be spent on records by new artists -- you know, the 
nearly forgotten entity once reverently referred to as "the lifeblood of the 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe I'm wrong and there is enough consumer interest out there for the record 
business to survive simply by recycling old Phil Collins albums forever on a 
succession of new formats. 
</P>
<P>
But when you wake up one day to discover that the invasion is over and that the 
alien has won the war of the disc formats, remember: You've been warned.

O.C. COULD HAVE A MAJOR STAKE IN REDISTRICTING FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA LUTHER, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reapportionment, a 15-letter word for political trouble, is lurking around the 
corner of the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing is certain in this highly emotional, extremely important decennial 
process aimed at evening up legislative and congressional districts. But if 
things go as they appear now, California will get an additional four to six 
seats in Congress, and at least part of one could be in Orange County, where 
the population has grown considerably in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, lines for 40 state Senate and 80 Assembly districts will be 
redrawn to reflect California's population shifts, primarily to the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
Although reapportionment is still 2 years away, Republicans, including GOP 
leaders in Orange County, already are trying to figure out how to head off a 
redistricting that favors Democrats. And Democrats, who control the state 
Legislature, where the lines are drawn, are trying to figure out how to hold 
control of the mapping. Both sides will be armed with highly refined computer 
programs that will massage the basic building blocks for creating partisan 
districts: population and voter patterns. 
</P>
<P>
"Reapportionment is the most difficult thing for people to understand, to 
realize it is possible with the use of very sophisticated computer programs to 
design districts to ensure an outcome before a single vote is cast," said 
Assembly Minority Leader Ross Johnson (R-La Habra). 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, how district lines are drawn will shape the makeup of the state Senate, 
Assembly and U.S. House of Representatives into the 21st Century. The party 
that emerges most powerful will have primary say over state and federal 
legislation affecting issues ranging from Social Security benefits to highway 
construction, air pollution and national security. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Republicans, coming from one of the strongest GOP bases in the 
nation, are trying to prevent the kind of redistricting that happened in 1981, 
when Democrats were not only in power in the Legislature but had two other 
advantages: a Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, to sign into law the plan 
fashioned by Democrats, and a state Supreme Court dominated by Brown appointees 
to hear appeals of lawsuits filed against the plan by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
The result was an artful gerrymander -- not unlike similar geographical marvels 
fashioned by Republicans when they were in power in the 1950s -- that withstood 
legal challenges even beyond the state's courts to as august a body as the U.S. 
Supreme Court. The high court decided only last month that California 
Republicans had no legal basis to attack the plan engineered by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incumbents Protected 
</P>
<P>
The 1981 plan was primarily the work of the late Rep. Phil Burton (D-San 
Francisco), whose now-famous assurance to both Democrats and Republicans 
anxiously awaiting the final plan was, "You're in your mother's hands." The 
plan not only protected all Democratic incumbents but also most GOP incumbents 
-- at the expense of a handful of Republicans whose districts were "collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
But there was no doubt which party emerged the victor. It can be seen in this 
simple result: Democrats have had a lock on their majorities in both the 
Legislature and the state's delegation to the House of Representatives. In 
Congress, for example, only one seat in the state has changed parties in 180 
races in the last decade -- the 38th District post won by Republican Robert K. 
Dornan of Garden Grove in 1984 over 10-year incumbent Jerry M. Patterson, a 
moderate Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
"In political terms, that's the most effective gerrymander in the history of 
the United States," GOP reapportionment expert Tony Quinn said. Articulating a 
familiar theme among Republicans that the GOP has made great strides in 
attracting voters, Quinn added, "The congressional delegation, in particular, 
defies the political behavior of the state." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn said the Burton plan accomplished this by "literally cement(ing) 
everybody in place. Not only are there no shifts, there are virtually no 
competitive races." 
</P>
<P>
"Phil Burton was, let's say, a Democrat's Democrat," said Richard J. O'Neill of 
San Juan Capistrano, a former state Democratic Party chairman, speaking 
admiringly of Burton's redistricting skills. "He hit hard and he fought hard. 
He didn't take anybody's crap. He was the most feared Democrat in California." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Everyone for Himself 
</P>
<P>
Burton also understood probably better than anyone this basic rule of 
redistricting: everyone for himself. There are few, if any, incumbents who are 
willing to be sacrificial lambs to the greater good of either party, and almost 
as few who would give up even a modicum of voter registration "safety" to help 
a colleague. 
</P>
<P>
Burton, however, is dead. His partner in past redistricting, behind-the-scenes 
political strategist Michael Berman, brother of Rep. Howard Berman (D-Studio 
City), undoubtedly will have a hand in drawing the lines in 1991. House 
Majority Whip Tony Coelho (D-Merced) is also expected to play a strong role. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no question that, as one Democrat involved in redistricting put 
it, "there will be a sense that Phil's not there to speak for us." 
</P>
<P>
More important, there is a strong possibility that Democrats will fail in their 
effort to recapture the governorship in 1990, which will deprive them of the 
third leg of power they need to push through a reapportionment plan without the 
help of Republicans. Combine that with a move to the right on the state Supreme 
Court, as Gov. George Deukmejian's appointees have come to dominate, and the 
1991 redistricting promises to at least live up to, and perhaps even surpass, 
earlier reapportionment battles in its bitterness and divisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
While the process is highly unpredictable, there may be little change in Orange 
County's district lines, although some of the lawmakers who now cross county 
lines into San Diego, Los Angeles, Riverside or Imperial counties may find 
themselves pushed into one or another county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Much Shifting 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, who also is co-chairman of a volunteer committee within the Republican 
Party on reapportionment and election laws, predicted that there would not be 
much shifting of districts within Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the incumbents in Orange County should be in relatively good shape," 
Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
There are five members of Congress, all Republicans, whose districts are wholly 
or partly in Orange County: Dornan, William E. Dannemeyer of Fullerton, C. 
Christopher Cox of Newport Beach, Ron C. Packard of Carlsbad and Dana 
Rohrabacher of Lomita. 
</P>
<P>
Of the five, Dornan's district is the one that Democrats crafted in 1981 in the 
hopes of keeping at least a foothold in the county's congressional delegation. 
For 10 years until 1984, the district was represented by Patterson, a Garden 
Grove resident. But Dornan, whose former West Los Angeles seat had been 
gerrymandered in the 1981 redistricting to strip him of his Republican support, 
eyed the district's overwhelming support for President Reagan in the 1980 
election and rightly guessed that the district had become too conservative for 
Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
Although the district favors registered Democrats -- currently by 49% to 42% -- 
Republicans generally vote in greater numbers and are more loyal to their party 
than Democrats. Dornan easily beat Patterson, and Democrats have little hope 
that even the most drastic of gerrymanders could round up enough voters for 
their party to make the district competitive again. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, one Democratic reapportionment expert said, "there would be no 
point to destroying Dornan, no partisan interest in doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Democrats have a better shot at bringing the 72nd Assembly District back to the 
Democratic fold. Long represented by former Assemblyman Richard Robinson 
(D-Garden Grove), who quit to run unsuccessfully against Dornan for Congress, 
the 72nd District has been represented by Republicans since 1986. When former 
Assemblyman Richard E. Longshore (R-Santa Ana) died last year, Democrats made 
an all-out effort to recapture the district, falling just 867 votes short of 
defeating Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) in a controversial 
$1.9-million battle whose outcome is still a matter of legal dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats could try to bring in areas more favorable to them in Buena Park to 
bolster their chances in the 72nd, O'Neill said. "All you need is a thousand 
more votes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Orange County Democratic leader Howard Adler said, even that 
possibility is in question. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that if Democrats are going to pick up seats, they will be 
looking somewhere outside Orange County to do it," Adler said. "As a practical 
matter, Republicans have been winning all the marginal Democratic seats down 
here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Strategies 
</P>
<P>
On a broader level, state Republican leaders are now pinning their hopes on two 
strategies: statewide initiatives and keeping control of the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
There are at least two initiatives being crafted by Republicans for the 1990 
ballot, including one by Assembly Minority Leader Johnson that would force 
Democrats to follow guidelines -- such as drawing compact districts that do not 
cross city or county lines more than a set number of times -- more favorable to 
Republicans. Because it is generally believed that the public has little 
understanding of reapportionment, the reforms will probably be added to a 
measure that also would make major changes in the power structure in the 
Assembly -- a more politically viable topic for voters. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also would change the state Constitution since, as Republicans 
painfully learned, anything short of that gets caught in a quagmire in the 
courts over the issue of the legality of changing legislative rules by 
statutory initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The other initiative now under discussion would take the job of redistricting 
away from the Legislature and give it to an independent commission. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of proposed initiatives, Kenneth L. Khachigian of San Clemente, a 
former speech writer for President Reagan and a close adviser to Deukmejian, 
said: "It will be incumbent on Republicans to raise all the hell they can. . . 
. If we can get the boundaries even half fair, the Republicans will pick up 
seats all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Committed to Run 
</P>
<P>
With Deukmejian's decision not to seek a third term, the GOP put heavy pressure 
on U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson to run, which resulted in his Feb. 18 announcement to 
form an exploratory committee, essentially committing him to run for the post. 
</P>
<P>
Importantly, in his first speech as a gubernatorial candidate, Wilson opened 
the battle for reapportionment by calling for approval of the GOP's 
initiatives. "We cannot permit the people of California to undergo another 
cynical gerrymandering that will defraud California voters for the next 
decade," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
If elected, Wilson could veto any partisan Democratic plan, which would then 
require a two-thirds vote to override and put the GOP in a very strong 
bargaining position. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a Republican governor, then I think the Legislature is out of it," 
said James Tucker, chief legal counsel to Assembly Elections and 
Reapportionment during the 1981 redistricting. "I don't think they can come up 
with a plan that gets two-thirds of both houses." 
</P>
<P>
A veto undoubtedly would throw the matter into the courts, which appointed 
three masters in 1971 to draw the lines when the Legislature failed to approve 
a plan under the same situation: a Democratic-controlled Legislature and a 
Republican governor -- Reagan.

An officer convicted in the death of a Marine lance corporal who was left in 
the Mojave Desert last August was sentenced to four months in the brig and will 
be dismissed from the Marine Corps. A jury of eight officers at Camp LeJeune, 
N.C., deliberated about two hours before recommending the sentence for 1st Lt. 
Allen Lawson. Earlier, the same jury convicted Lawson of dereliction of duty 
and an unrelated charge of appearing drunk in public in December. Lawson, 25, 
of Flint, Mich., was the only commissioned officer charged in the case; two 
sergeants were convicted earlier.

<P>
MERLIN: One rare winter visitor to Orange County is the merlin, a falcon that 
breeds at high latitudes through the northern hemisphere and usually winters 
north of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Once known as the pigeon hawk, the merlin feeds on small birds. In a typical 
winter, only two or three merlins are spotted in Orange County. "That's a 
pretty rare bird," said Doug Willick, who compiles a list of rare bird 
sightings in the county for American Bird magazine. "It's a fairly rare winter 
visitor." 
</P>
<P>
Willick recalled three sightings in the county so far this winter before this 
week, when one of the birds was found critically injured, victim of a shooting. 
It is one of a rash of unexplained shootings of birds of prey -- 30 dead or 
injured birds have been found so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
Other victims of the shootings have included sharp-shinned hawks, Cooper's 
hawks, red-tailed hawks, red-shouldered hawks, American kestrals, barn owls and 
a great-horned owl. The 30 known shootings in the county matches the total for 
all of 1988. Many have been found in business or commercial areas, apparently 
shot from automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
FAREWELL TOURS: Saturday marks the last public walking tours of the season 
offered by Amigos de Bolsa Chica and Friends of Newport Bay. 
</P>
<P>
At Bolsa Chica and Upper Newport Bay, volunteers will be stationed at various 
points along the tour to describe the wildlife, geology, human history and 
current status of the wetland reserves. Both areas are vital wintering grounds 
for many migratory birds. 
</P>
<P>
At both locations, the free tours leave every 15 to 20 minutes from 9 to 10:30 
a.m. Tours last about 1 1/2 hours. Wear comfortable shoes, and a hat if the sun 
is out. Binoculars and a bird identification guide are recommended. 
</P>
<P>
The Bolsa Chica tours leave from the ecological reserve parking lot on Pacific 
Coast Highway, across from the entrance to Bolsa Chica State Beach between 
Warner Avenue and Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY TRIP: The Santa Ana Zoo is offering a family field trip to the Santa 
Rosa Plateau in Riverside County, an area of wildflowers and oaks, on March 25. 
Zoo staff will lead participants on an easy-paced, 4-mile hike through the 
wildlife-rich area. The plateau is home to five endangered species and several 
rare plant communities, including vernal pools and southern oak savanna. 
</P>
<P>
Tuition per parent/child pair is $25 and includes field instruction, materials 
and transportation. Space is limited. For reservations, call Jennifer Rigby, 
(714) 836-4000.

'BIG HARRY' RECALLED AS RECREATION'S 'GENTLE GIANT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CICCHESE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of Huntington Beach residents gathered under a giant pine tree 
Saturday to mourn Harry Montague and remember his work with the city's youth. 
</P>
<P>
Fondly known as "Big Harry," Montague was with the recreation department for 12 
years, coaching the essentials of sports and offering a willing ear to those in 
need. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a gentle giant," remembered co-worker Suzie Smith of the 6-foot, 
5-inch, 240-pound Montague. "He just had a way about him that the kids were 
drawn to. They were very comfortable with him." 
</P>
<P>
Montague, an avid bicyclist, was killed last June in a bicycle accident on 
Pacific Coast Highway. He was 40. 
</P>
<P>
Although he enjoyed all sports, Montague's true love was basketball. With 
dozens of the young athletes he coached looking on Saturday, a towering pine 
tree in front of city basketball courts at 21377 Magnolia Ave., along with a 
plaque, were dedicated to his memory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scholarship Fund Created 
</P>
<P>
And four young athletes -- two young men and two young women -- were awarded 
the first Montague scholarships from a fund created after his death by friends 
and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The $10,000 scholarship fund yielded the first four $400 scholarships. Each 
winner was a member of the Edison High School varsity basketball team. They 
were Laura Radloff, Tiffany Nii, Jason Carey and Bryan Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Nii called Montague "the nicest man I ever met." 
</P>
<P>
For Carey, Montague was "one of the most influential persons in my life. He got 
me started in basketball in the third grade. . . . He was truly a good friend." 
</P>
<P>
"Harry never blew his own horn," said Shirley Carey, Jason's mother. "He may 
not have realized the impact he had. We all thought he would be around 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Evelyn Montague, was pleased with the memorial. She said she was 
both gratified and surprised at the outpouring of affection. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know him as a community leader," Evelyn Montague said. "I just knew 
him as a kidder at home." 
</P>
<P>
Montague grew up in Long Beach and went to Millikan High School and Long Beach 
City College. He earned an economics degree at UCLA and a masters degree in 
recreation from Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Werth, the city's senior recreation supervisor, said Montague viewed his 
position as more than a job and that he had an 
"above-and-beyond-the-call-of-duty attitude." 
</P>
<P>
"He saw hundreds of kids each day and he knew almost all of them by name," 
Werth said. "He even knew a little something about each one. He had an 
outstanding memory." 
</P>
<P>
"He is being sorely missed. Very few like him come along," Smith said. "He 
encouraged the kids that had potential to get into coaching. He gave them a 
sense of responsibility. Harry saw in them what others didn't see."

LEWIS DISMISSED FROM FULLERTON'S BASKETBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rashone Lewis was dismissed from the Cal State Fullerton basketball team 
Saturday by Athletic Director Ed Carroll for violating a university regulation, 
the school announced in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
"I discussed the situation with Coach John Sneed and he concurred with the 
decision," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll would not elaborate on the offense, but said that it would be up to 
Sneed whether Lewis could return next season. 
</P>
<P>
Sneed said it was a "possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a 6-foot-5 sophomore forward, played in all 24 games as a reserve. He 
was averaging 1.3 points and two rebounds a game.

THE BRITISH HAVE COME, SEEN, BOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Campbell was looking for the cash to pay for expanding his chain of eight 
Orange County car dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
Lex Service PLC, the largest auto dealer in the United Kingdom, with about 70 
dealerships, was looking to America to expand. Campbell contacted Lex and, 
within 6 months, they sealed a deal that gave Lex half of Campbell Automotive 
for $13.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Our corporate philosophies, or corporate cultures, and our marketing were 
almost identical," Campbell said. "We felt very compatible, and now, after 6 
months, things couldn't be working any better." 
</P>
<P>
The transaction provides a local glimpse at a mighty British juggernaut that 
has hit the United States through most of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
With a long history of investments in U.S. firms, the British have been buying 
companies here at a record pace that far outdistances that of any other foreign 
country. And while the lower value of the dollar has helped to spur the buying 
spree, cultural and historical ties, as well as an economic revival under Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher, have helped to sustain it. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 2 years, the British have pumped in more than $60 billion to buy 
398 U.S. firms, including Farmers Group in Los Angeles, which BAT Industries 
bought for $5.2 billion, and Pillsbury Co. in Minneapolis, for which Grand 
Metropolitan paid $5.75 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The British have found a way to recapture the American colonies," Arthur D. 
Perrone Jr., vice chairman of the Geneva Corp., said half jokingly. Geneva is 
an Irvine firm that arranges mergers and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Last year British firms spent $32.5 billion buying U.S. companies while the 
Japanese, their nearest foreign competitor for U.S. assets, spent about $12 
billion, according to the British American Deal Review, which tracks foreign 
investments here. 
</P>
<P>
Following them were Canadian investors who, on the strength of Campeau Corp.'s 
$6.6-billion acquisition of Federated Department Stores, paid $8.2 billion for 
U.S. corporate assets last year. West Germans spent $3.1 billion, according to 
the Deal Review. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the British paid $31 billion to buy U.S. corporations, while the 
Japanese paid $6.2 billion, the West Germans spent $4.1 billion and the 
Canadians $2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the British buying habits more remarkable is that they have 
accumulated their huge stake with barely a complaint from the U.S. public, 
which has been more suspicious and critical of the intrusion of investors from 
other countries, particularly from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are U.K. investors outspending those from Japan and other countries in 
gross terms, they are spending a great deal more in proportion to the British 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
"In relation to their own economy, the British are spending nine times more 
than the Japanese are spending," said Mark Dixon, editor of the Deal Review. 
</P>
<P>
"The real story is that Americans don't realize that the Japanese are not at 
all the biggest buyers of U.S. corporate assets." 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese point to such statistics to show that they have been unfairly 
portrayed as trying to buy America, when the British already seem to own it. 
</P>
<P>
The perception that the Japanese are invading U.S. board rooms can be traced to 
cultural differences and timing, said Hiroyuki Saito, executive vice president 
of Mitsui &amp; Co., a Japanese trading firm with offices in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We have come here all of a sudden," Saito also said about Japanese 
investments. "The British have been coming here for 200 years." 
</P>
<P>
He said he suspects that prejudice against the Japanese also exists in the 
public's mind, at least subconsciously. 
</P>
<P>
"That's very difficult to get rid of," he said. "The Japanese have a different 
religion, and they also behave a little differently. That's kind of scary to 
the American way of thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Japanese investments attract more attention partly because of ethnic, cultural 
and language differences, and partly because Japan, as a greater economic 
power, has the potential to wield much greater influence over the U.S. economy, 
said Peter Kuhlmann of Translink International Group, a Swiss-based investment 
banking firm that owns the British American Deal Review. That clout tends to 
generate more public concern about the impact of foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
"You just don't get that kind of backlash that you get when the Japanese buy," 
Kuhlmann said about British companies. "You don't get the perception that 
Britain is stealing our assets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slackening Predicted 
</P>
<P>
Some observers believe that all foreign investments, including British 
purchases, will slacken in the United States once the 12 countries of the 
European Economic Community strip away trade barriers in 1992 to create what 
some call the United States of Europe -- the Western world's biggest 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
But those who specialize in British-American deals contend that British buying 
should not slow down just because the European market is more consolidated. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect the level to increase," said David V. Gardner, an international 
business lawyer who is a director of the British American Chamber of Commerce 
in Santa Monica. "But it won't be just British companies alone coming here. It 
will also be U.K. companies that would use European allies in joint ventures to 
buy U.S. firms." 
</P>
<P>
The British aggressiveness in venturing into the United States during the 1980s 
has been a pleasant surprise for lawyer Gardner, who attributed it to 
Thatcher's Conservative Party policies.

"I left England 10 years ago because there didn't appear to be a future in the 
U.K.," he said. "But there has been a revival of entrepreneurialism, and the 
attitude of business and the attitude of government toward business has turned 
around." 
</P>

<P>
Key Advantages for British 
</P>
<P>
Dixon and his British American Deal Review have come up with a comprehensive 
rationale for the boom in British buying here. That rationale includes the 
common language, culture and historical roots, as well as the capitalist spirit 
revived by Thatcher. But it also identifies other advantages the British have 
over most other foreign firms: 
</P>
<P>
* With more than 200 years of investing here, the British have accumulated a 
substantial stake in the U.S. corporate world and tend to choose more 
acquisitions nearer in kind and location to former purchases. 
</P>
<P>
* Many British firms have also saturated the market in England and Europe and 
need to look elsewhere if they are to grow and prosper, with America the most 
attractive market, he said. When one company comes over its competitors soon 
follow, because the British have learned that growth in America can hurt 
competitors who remain at home. 
</P>
<P>
* The Deal Review's "relative pricing index" -- an amalgamation of such factors 
as the value of the U.K. stock market, compared to that of the U.S. stock 
market -- has shown that U.S. corporate assets are cheap because their stock 
markets have put higher values on their companies than Wall Street has put on 
U.S. firms. 
</P>
<P>
The British also seem to enjoy considerable U.S. good will. Nationality is an 
issue that can work against any outsider except the British, it seems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Swedish Firm Opposed 
</P>
<P>
In Lawrenceburg, Tenn., for instance, local citizens rallied last spring to 
block a hostile takeover of Murray Ohio Manufacturing Co. by a Swedish firm, AB 
Electrolux. Local residents, including employees at the company's factory for 
lawn mowers and bicycles, protested that takeover with an elaborate campaign to 
say nej -- Swedish for no -- to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The protest included a rally of 4,000 residents, a petition with 5,000 
signatures delivered to the Swedish ambassador and an array of posters, buttons 
and T-shirts emblazoned with the word nej. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Murray Ohio, which is based in Nashville, eventually found a 
white knight offering $4 a share more to rescue it from the Swedes. 
</P>
<P>
The white knight was Tomkins PLC, a British conglomerate. The residents barely 
uttered a word of protest. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't so much the money that changed the minds of executives," said Dixon, 
who condemned both the "xenophobic" activity and Murray Ohio's role in 
condoning it. "They felt comfortable because Tomkins was going to keep them in 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"My belief is that managers themselves are drawing on these fears, with the 
sole aim not of protecting their industry from foreign raiders but of 
protecting their own jobs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defusing Nationality Issue 
</P>
<P>
Language and common customs can defuse the issue of nationality in the case of 
the British and have given them easy access to the U.S. market. Even the 
once-hostile approach BAT Industries was using to take over Farmers evaporated 
after the chairmen of the two firms finally met and talked together for a few 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"The similarity in language and customs has made it much easier to operate," 
said William T. Lightcap, an American who is executive vice president of ARC 
America, a Newport Beach sand-and-gravel company bought in 1977 by Consolidated 
Gold Fields PLC. "It enabled us to get along very well." 
</P>
<P>
Other county executives who have recently teamed up with British firms said 
nationality is irrelevant in forging the deals. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the buyer was British was almost incidental to the deal," said 
Robert Bonney, chairman of EECO, which last month sold a division to a British 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Those who bring the suitors to America, however, tend to disagree. 
</P>
<P>
The French, the Swiss, the Japanese and the West Germans have an especially 
difficult time in putting U.S. targets at ease, partly because of language and 
cultural differences, said Kuhlmann of Translink International. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Specialty Drug Industry 
</P>
<P>
"A businessman in the specialty drug chemical industry in Atlanta came from a 
simple background and has built an extremely successful private firm," Kuhlmann 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"For 6 months, he was talking with the French (about a sale of his company), 
and they couldn't get through to each other. There was not a good sense of 
harmony and well-being, no sense of camaraderie or compromise." 
</P>
<P>
When a British investor was brought in recently, "the same person in talking 
with the British investor had an immediate sense of rapport," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The two are now further along in talks than the French ever got, he said. 
</P>
<P>
From the end of World War II until the late 1970s, Americans bought British 
corporate assets at about twice the rate that the British were buying U.S. 
assets, according to the British American Deal Review. 
</P>
<P>
For the last decade, the British have been outspending Americans, yet both 
remain the biggest investors in each other's countries, Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
While the British buying binge has kept them at the top of the list as the 
biggest investors in U.S. securities, they still own less than 2% of total U.S. 
corporate assets, said Mark Dixon, editor of the British American Deal Review, 
which tracks foreign investments here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6% of U.S. Assets Controlled 
</P>
<P>
Despite growing uneasiness here about foreign investments and the threat of 
protectionist legislation, only about 6% of U.S. corporate assets are 
controlled by foreign entities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush welcomes foreign investments. He warned Americans last week not 
to get "so concerned about foreign ownership" that they discourage other 
investors from other countries, particularly the Japanese, from buying U.S. 
securities. Such discouragement would "undermine" U.S. efforts to reduce the 
budget deficit, in part through foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of what country buys more U.S. corporate assets, many economists, 
business executives, international investment bankers and experts in mergers 
and acquisitions encourage the international buying and selling of corporate 
assets. And they downplay the "invasion" of foreign investments in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of (U.S.) companies acquired by foreign investors has been on the 
rise, but it is an inroad rather than an invasion," Eric S. Rosengren, an 
economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, wrote in the latest edition 
of the New England Economic Review. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost every single year, our effect on the British economy is greater than 
their effect on our economy," he said. "Look at their total investment last 
year: $32 billion. The RJR Nabisco deal alone was nearly $25 billion. If you 
went into Canada or the United Kingdom with that amount of money, you'd have a 
tremendous impact on that country's economy." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the increasing presence of British firms -- as well as West German, 
Japanese, Canadian, French and Swiss -- indicates how interwoven the world 
economy is and how growing foreign companies need to expand beyond their 
borders to help maintain a healthy economy worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"America is part of one huge world and involved in sharing in corporate 
assets," Dixon said. "What we've seen in the last few years is just the tip of 
an enormous iceberg in which all Western nations will own significant pieces of 
other nations' manufacturing and corporate assets. And these ownerships will be 
determined not by nationality but by practicality." 
</P>
<P>
Sometime in the next century, he predicted, U.S. firms will be half-owned by 
foreign investors, and Americans "won't even think of the companies as foreign 
owned." 
</P>
<P>
The same will be true in other countries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard N. Mackenzie, vice chairman and chief executive of General Automation, 
an Anaheim computer company that recently teamed up with Sanderson Electronic 
PLC of Britain, said: "The fact of life is that we are in a global market."

STOCK WATCH: ICN PHARMACEUTICALS SETUP IS VOLATILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHARLES TIGHE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recent fluctuations in the price of SPI Pharmaceuticals stock provide a prime 
example of volatility that comes with investing in any of the three companies 
controlled by Costa Mesa-based ICN Pharmaceuticals, controversial developer of 
the antiviral drug ribavirin. 
</P>
<P>
SPI stock rose 25% in 5 days earlier this month after an earnings report that 
"was about a penny (per share) better than expected. But nothing worth a 25% 
increase," said Steven Reid, an analyst for L.H. Friend &amp; Co., a brokerage 
firm in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
SPI shares climbed from $8.88 on Feb. 10 to $11.13 on Feb. 17, then fell 10% 
during last week's broad market downturn to close Friday at $10. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, shares of another subsidiary, ICN Biomedicals, plunged 24% over 
a 4-day period -- with nothing in the news to account for the fall, according 
to industry analysts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reason for Volatility 
</P>
<P>
ICN Pharmaceuticals' overwhelming control of its subsidiaries -- the third is 
money-losing Viratek -- is the big reason for the volatility, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, ICN Pharmaceuticals owns nearly 90% of SPI's stock, meaning that 
few shares are publicly available. The scarcity of shares on the open market 
results in low trading volume and means that it takes only a few buyers or 
sellers to cause the price to fluctuate wildly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's confusing, at best" to follow the four interrelated companies' stocks, 
said Eugene Melnitchenko, director of research for the Dallas brokerage firm of 
Eppler, Guerin &amp; Turner. "Typically, businesses are spun off to realize 
greater value," he said, but the ICN companies' administrative independence 
"stands in the way" of financial performance. 
</P>
<P>
The current setup costs as much as $10 million a year in added overhead, 
Melnitchenko said. Despite that criticism, Melnitchenko is a perennial ICN 
booster. He said he has encouraged company Chairman Milan Panic to bring the 
subsidiaries and parent firm together to end the confusion. 
</P>
<P>
But ICN Pharmaceuticals spokesman Jack Sholl said there are no plans to change 
the current structure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fluctuations Expected 
</P>
<P>
That being the case, stock price fluctuations are expected to continue. 
</P>
<P>
But for SPI's stock, analysts said, most movement will be up. 
</P>
<P>
"SPI is the most solid of the subsidiaries," said Reid, who expects the company 
to earn $12.1 million for its fiscal 1989, which ends Nov. 30. Earlier this 
month, SPI reported fiscal 1988 net earnings of $10.2 million, up 21%. Sales 
for the year were up 47% to $115.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
SPI expects $15 million in sales this year just from products it markets in 
America for F. Hoffman-La Roche, the giant Swiss drug maker that ought into 
last year in a failed takeover bid that elicited cries of "greenmail." ICN 
later sold the stock. 
</P>
<P>
Melnitchenko said the potential of SPI stock is limited because of its 
affiliation with ICN, which has been shadowed by controversy both in its stock 
dealings and in its marketing of ribavirin. Most recently, some medical 
authorities have clamed that ICN failed to warn that inhaling the aerosol mist 
used to deliver the drug to children with severe lung infections could lead to 
birth defects among pregnant health-care workers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt that if SPI were an independent drug company, it would be 
worth significantly more. A lot of people stay away because, as wise a man as 
he is, these people don't like Milan Panic," said Reid, the L.H. Friend 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Connor, an analyst at Edward A. Viner &amp; Co., a brokerage firm in 
New York, is one of those who stays away. "We do not recommend involvement with 
these companies because we . . . find that (Panic's) work has not been as an 
administrator or discoverer of new medical compounds. His work is in his 
financial machinations, which have succeeded in creating a hodgepodge of 
confusion for the investor," he said.

ACCIDENTS SPOTLIGHT ISSUE OF BOEING QUALITY CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Employees on Boeing's aircraft assembly lines are working 12 hours a day and 
seven days a week in many cases, attempting to catch up on delivery delays that 
have infuriated airlines around the world. 
</P>
<P>
But a concern is growing among industry safety experts and throughout the 
aviation community that the Boeing Co. may be pushing too hard, that it is 
making some sloppy errors that are not expected from a company held to be one 
of the nation's premier manufacturing companies. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't sense a crisis at Boeing, but I do sense a series of tragic and 
unfortunate incidents," said John H. Enders, president of the Flight Safety 
Foundation, a nonprofit organization funded by airlines, manufacturers and 
others. "Appropriate corrective action is being taken . . . but not as quickly 
as the public would like." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the apparent in-flight structural failure of a United Airlines 747 
after taking off from Hawaii on Friday was only the latest case that has 
focused worldwide attention on Boeing products. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing has not been held responsible for any of the incidents, and current 
problems at the company's aircraft plants clearly have nothing to do with what 
befell the 19-year-old jet that had to return to Honolulu after a large section 
of its fuselage was torn away in flight resulting in the loss of nine 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
But the incident occurred at a bad time for Boeing.

<P>
In the past year, the company has been hit by reports of mis- wired safety 
equipment on its jets, a half-dozen cases of airframe structural failure during 
flights and growing production problems that have forced delays in deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very angry," Lufthansa executive board Chairman Heinz Ruhnau said in a 
recent interview about the three-to-six-month delays in deliveries of new 747s. 
"It is going to cost us a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Even some Boeing employees are now complaining that they see quality control 
slipping at their company, which has gained world dominance of the commercial 
aircraft industry in large measure through a reputation for quality and value. 
During 1988, Boeing grabbed two-thirds of the Western world's orders for 
commercial jets. 
</P>
<P>
"The growth really ran away," said Richard Ferguson, a Boeing engineer who 
retired earlier this month. "The new people coming in are not receiving the 
guidance, help and direction that they would receive normally. They are running 
more on their own. That allows mistakes to be made." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls Training Inadequate 
</P>
<P>
One Boeing hourly worker with more than a decade of experience put it more 
bluntly. "I think the quality stinks," she said, asking that her name be 
withheld. She was recently promoted to a toolmaking job, but considers her 
training for it inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave me a job that I wasn't qualified for," she said. "I don't even read 
blueprints. It required things I had never done -- drilling holes and measuring 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Although Boeing executives acknowledge that the company is experiencing growth 
problems in a number of areas, they believe that each incident is isolated and 
not indicative of a systemic erosion of discipline. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of things have been put together and collected in a bucket and some 
conclusions drawn," Boeing Executive Vice President Philip M. Condit said in a 
recent interview. "But they don't necessarily -- and they frequently don't -- 
relate to each other." 
</P>
<P>
Condit said Boeing was incorrectly blamed initially for the crash of a Pan 
American World Airways 747 jetliner in December in Lockerbie, Scotland. The 
crash is now believed to have been caused by a bomb. A problem with mis-wiring 
at Boeing was also blamed at first for the crash of a British Midlands 737, but 
mis-wiring has now been ruled out as a cause. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uncovers 'Shortcomings' 
</P>
<P>
Still, Condit admitted that he has uncovered "shortcomings in the system" and 
that he is "not satisfied" with Boeing quality. A few months ago, Dean 
Thornton, president of the Boeing commercial airplane subsidiary, went even 
further in a Times interview, saying that quality had slipped a bit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're being burned by our own success," Thornton said last November. "We've 
got too much on our plate. We've got too many inexperienced workers -- green 
peas, we call them -- and not enough old-timers who know how to do things. 
We're working too much overtime. We're stretched right now." 
</P>
<P>
Since Thornton made those statements, Boeing has confirmed that at least 10 of 
its 757 and 767 jetliners delivered to airlines and used in passenger 
operations had improperly wired fire extinguishers in the cargo hold. 
</P>
<P>
The Boeing image began suffering after it was disclosed that a faulty repair 
done by Boeing on a bulkhead of a Japan Air Lines 747 had caused a crash in 
1985, resulting in 517 deaths. Since then, a series of structural failures has 
underscored concern about Boeing jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, an engine fell off one of Piedmont Airlines' Boeing 737s in an 
incident caused by metal fatigue in a bolt. In December, a 14-inch hole ripped 
open in the fuselage of an Eastern Airlines 727 in flight. In September, an 
American Airlines 727 landed on its belly when metal fatigue prevented the 
landing gear doors from opening. Most notably, a large section of the fuselage 
of an Aloha Airlines 737 flew off last April, killing a flight attendant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evidence Mounting 
</P>
<P>
The series of structural failures and the JAL incident raised concerns about 
older Boeing aircraft, but evidence has been mounting of quality problems on 
current production aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
British Airways last year complained to Boeing about, among other things, 
"missing fasteners, missing parts, cracks, and rivets fitted the wrong way." 
The memo alleged that the airline's inspectors had found "instances of these on 
every aircraft" it had recently bought from Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Boeing disclosed the wiring problems and the Federal Aviation 
Administration ordered sweeping inspections of Boeing jets. 
</P>
<P>
The wiring mistakes were not blamed on workers alone. Rather, Condit 
acknowledged, the design itself permitted the errors to be made in the first 
place. They occurred on the factory floor, he said, and went undetected during 
automated checkouts of the aircraft wiring system. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Boeing is reassessing other areas where its designs may allow 
workers to err. It is reconsidering how it performs electrical checks. It has 
revised its procedures and is making a general effort to improve quality, 
Condit said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the design of airplanes, you try very hard to make the design 
Murphy-proof," Condit said. "You look at it every way you know how to say, 'Can 
this thing be hooked up incorrectly?' But that's a continuing effort." 
</P>
<P>
Condit insists that Boeing aircraft are safe. "The product we're producing is 
of high quality. If you look at the safety statistics, we keep getting better." 
</P>
<P>
But as Boeing attempts to cure its problems, even isolated ones, it is also 
facing a massive production buildup. By mid-1990, it will be turning out 
aircraft at the rate of more than one a day or 408 per year, a 28% increase 
from today's already high rate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demands on Workers 
</P>
<P>
The schedules are putting heavy overtime demands on workers, and that is 
hurting quality, said officials at the company's Aerospace Machinists union. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are forced to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week, your quality is 
going to slip up," said union agent Bob Ripley at Boeing's plant in the Seattle 
suburb of Everett, where 747s and 767s are assembled. "We are getting a lot of 
complaints (from workers) about quality. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 14,000 hourly workers up here at Everett," he said. "They are 
stacking people up. It is people standing on top of people. I feel a lot of 
tension. Up here, it is mass confusion." 
</P>
<P>
Even scientists and engineers are affected by the overtime demands, said Dan 
Mahoney, general counsel of the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees 
Assn., another union representing 26,600 Boeing workers. "Quality has to go 
down, there is no question about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Boeing officials take exception to such assessments, the company was 
forced earlier this month to stop the production lines in Everett because so 
much work was being done out of sequence, Condit said. That occurred because 
certain tasks had fallen behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agrees to Limits 
</P>
<P>
Boeing is trying to cut overtime and last year agreed to limit each worker's 
overtime to no more than 200 hours per calendar quarter, roughly 15 hours a 
week. But during production crunches, many workers still find themselves 
working 12-hour days for long stretches without weekends off, workers and union 
officials say. Much of the work is physically rigorous, putting additional 
stresses on workers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an area we need to do better in," Condit said. On average, Boeing 
workers are putting in 8.8 hours per week of overtime, roughly 22% above a 
standard week. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to drive down overtime will depend on increasing the efficiency of 
the existing work force and hiring new workers. 
</P>
<P>
So far in 1989, the company has added 1,500 new employees at its Seattle area 
plants. And during the past several years, the Boeing commercial operation has 
doubled its work force. "They are coming in groups of 75 or 100 at a time, two 
or three times a week," said one tube shop worker at Everett. "It is 
astronomical, the number of people coming in." 
</P>
<P>
Boeing insists that it has not lowered its standards, but union officials 
allege that the new workers are undertrained. 
</P>
<P>
"They are bringing in employees who don't know . . . (anything) about the jobs 
they are doing," said Ripley, who spent 13 years as a machinist at Boeing 
before becoming a union agent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Workers Reassigned 
</P>
<P>
One practice involves "emergency classification," in which higher-grade 
employees are assigned to lower-grade work in areas behind schedule. "It takes 
them a while to learn what they are doing," Ripley said. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, new hires are being brought in with minimal knowledge of 
aircraft work, though they are required to spend about five weeks at a 
vocational school that teaches the basics of riveting, drilling and wiring, 
among other skills. They are derisively known on the line as "five-week 
wonders." 
</P>
<P>
But Condit said Boeing is going to great lengths to recruit new workers with an 
average of more than five years of aircraft-related work experience, which is 
unchanged from its hiring practices of five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the company is hiring hourly workers in Southern California and 
Georgia and paying moving expenses to resettle them in Seattle, an 
extraordinary measure for non-professional employees. 
</P>
<P>
Even with those special efforts, though, it was inevitable that the average 
seniority levels would decline as Boeing built up its work force. Such cycles 
have occurred through the company's history. 
</P>
<P>
But Ferguson, the retired Boeing engineer, believes that the sharp downturn in 
the aircraft industry in 1970 and 1971, in which Boeing's Seattle area 
unemployment plummeted from 101,544 to 38,069 inflicted a permanent problem on 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost Workers 
</P>
<P>
"They lost a large chunk of the people who today would be middle-aged," he 
said. "They would be the lead people going into supervision and technical 
roles. I call it the missing generation of people in their 40s and 50s." 
</P>
<P>
Another long-term issue is whether the new workers have the same level of 
discipline and pride as past generations in their work on products that 
millions of people depend on for safe public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are in an industry where your action affects life, there is a duty of 
care involved," said Enders, the president of the Flight Safety Foundation. 
"The idea of craft is that you develop an intense pride in your work. I don't 
know if you find a lot of that attitude in people's work anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Enders worries that Boeing, along with others in the air transport industry, 
cannot isolate themselves from the pervasive problems of society, such as 
illiteracy, drug abuse and obsession with materialism. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing officials insist that the quality of their airliners is excellent, and 
they are increasingly angry about the negative image they are getting. 
</P>
<P>
Ben A. Cosgrove, Boeing vice president for engineering, recalls that a Boeing 
worker was recently in the hospital and was chided by doctors because of the 
company's quality problems. 
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove said he told the worker, "Listen, when Boeing makes a mistake, the 
newspapers put it on the front page. When a newspaper makes a mistake, it's 
buried inside. But when a doctor makes a mistake, it's buried."
