When the San Diego Unified Port District commissioners refused last week to 
name the city's new $160-million bayfront convention center after the Rev. Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr., longtime black civil-rights activist Vernon Sukumu 
recalled thinking, "Same old story, new chapter." 
</P>
<P>
Other San Diegans of all races had similar thoughts, for the Board of Port 
Commissioners' rebuff of the attempt to honor the slain civil-rights leader was 
only the most recent in a series of racially tinged episodes in California's 
second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, San Diego -- now the nation's seventh-largest city 
-- has suffered through divisive controversies that included the firing of the 
city's first black city manager, a citizen-led referendum that overturned a 
City Council decision to rename a major thoroughfare for King, the racially 
charged trial of a young black man who eventually was acquitted of killing a 
white policeman, and now, the Port District's refusal to endorse the council's 
plan to rename the new convention center after King. 
</P>
<P>
Also, racial tensions in schools and the locally based national white 
supremacist group headed by Tom Metzger have drawn occasional headlines, and 
the city's decision late last year to close several beachfront parking lots 
overnight had racial overtones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sobering Question 
</P>
<P>
All of this has some residents in this booming coastal city pondering a 
particularly sobering question: Is San Diego, which calls itself America's 
Finest City, experiencing a rise in racism? 
</P>
<P>
Though some defend the city's racial climate while others caustically condemn 
it, the consensus is that San Diego's racial problems probably are comparable 
to those of other major American cities. What is significant, many say, is how 
the city has been slow to see -- and reluctant to accept -- that reality. 
</P>
<P>
"Without suggesting that there's rampant racism in San Diego, I think it's fair 
to say that public officials haven't always recognized the racial significance 
of their policy decisions," said San Diego City Councilman Bob Filner, who was 
arrested in Mississippi as a Freedom Rider in the 1960s. "Sure, there are 
racial problems here. And the way to start solving them is to start looking at 
these issues through different eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rohatyn concurs. He is a professor of philosophy at the University of 
San Diego and an occasional radio commentator on local issues. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with San Diego is that it has big-city problems but a small-town 
mentality," Rohatyn said. "It prefers to think of itself as this idyllic little 
seaside village, where we wink our eye and pretend that typical urban problems 
don't exist." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Picture 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s, however, have provided ample evidence to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
In the past five years alone, a city mayor and a councilman were forced from 
office by criminal charges, a nondescript madman killed 21 people at a 
McDonald's in the worst single-day massacre in U.S. history, and a series of 
100-decibel business scandals was topped by the collapse of J. David (Jerry) 
Dominelli's La Jolla investment empire after he admitted bilking investors out 
of more than $80 million. The city faces burgeoning drug and gang problems, the 
same deteriorating infrastructure and financial woes that confront other big 
cities, and it has seen mounting friction between local residents and the 
area's growing population of illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Now, last week's Port District vote has magnified a thorny, disturbing question 
over race relations that some political, business and community leaders argue 
has been minimized for too long. However, even as they encourage a kind of 
civic introspection, they also take comfort from the knowledge that San Diego's 
racial troubles pale by comparison to those of other major cities. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing to keep in mind is, whatever our problems are here, San Diego is 
light-years behind racially charged cities like Boston and Chicago," said Steve 
Erie, a political science professor at UC San Diego who specializes in ethnic 
politics. "If some of the things that have happened here had occurred in some 
other cities, you'd have seen rioting in the streets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Turn Other Cheek' 
</P>
<P>
That is partly attributable to the relatively mild, conciliatory tone often 
adopted by San Diego black leaders, who, as one of them put it, "perhaps have 
been too willing to turn the other cheek." 
</P>
<P>
Even last week's port vote appeared to leave more disappointment than anger in 
its wake among blacks, some of whom preferred to talk more about ongoing plans 
for a King memorial in Balboa Park than the convention center setback. 
</P>
<P>
"We've compromised ourselves to death," said the Rev. George Stevens, a 
firebrand '60s street activist who, though now an aide to Rep. Jim Bates (D-San 
Diego), still is willing to throw down the gauntlet on occasion. After the Port 
District vote, Stevens announced plans to organize a nationwide boycott against 
San Diego aimed at keeping tourists and conventioneers away -- a proposal that 
drew a lukewarm reception among other black leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's intense news media coverage of the port's vote and its aftermath 
left many leaders -- white as well as black -- fatigued, edgy and somewhat 
ashamed by the declining tenor of debate over how best to honor King. Herb 
Cawthorne, head of the Urban League's local office, flatly refused to comment 
on the matter, as did several council members and others inside and outside 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
For a far greater number, however, the port's action -- in which the 
commissioners, instead of naming the center after King, made him the first 
inductee in a proposed "Avenue of Honors" on the complex's terrace -- spawned 
reflection over the status of race relations in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Is There a Pattern? 
</P>
<P>
To link the dispute over the center's name to the council's 1986 dismissal of 
City Manager Sylvester Murray and the controversial 1986-87 trials of police 
killer Sagon Penn, some argue, overlooks the disparate factors behind each and, 
perhaps, ascribes a commonality that is more theory than fact. Most local 
leaders, however, regard the surface similarity of the events as sufficient 
justification for treating them as a pattern, not as isolated occurrences. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there clearly is a connection that shows that San Diego, like every 
other city, has racism," said Susan Golding, chairman of the county Board of 
Supervisors. "That's not to say they all stemmed from racism because there were 
other causes, too. But the perception of racism is there, and perception is 
usually more important than reality." 
</P>
<P>
Explanations about the causes and state of racial relations in San Diego begin 
with the city's demographic makeup. Blacks account for only about 9% of the 
city's 1.1 million population and 1869507705found in any other American city 
its size. By comparison, 1980 census data showed that Dallas, which has almost 
the same population as San Diego, had a 29% black population and Los Angeles 
17%. 
</P>
<P>
Though San Diego's growing Latino population, nearing twice the size of the 
black community, has occasionally been at loggerheads with the city's political 
leadership, those disputes generally have not been as emotional. And despite 
the continued infusion of Asian immigrants, San Diego remains, in the words of 
one social scientist, "the whitest border-area city in America." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Clout 
</P>
<P>
The resulting lack of black political clout is compounded, blacks admit, by 
their historical inability to effectively organize at the polls or to push for 
major goals at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1987 election highlighted by two issues of particular import to blacks -- 
the first "open" seat race in a heavily black council district in nearly two 
decades and an emotional initiative over whether to change the name of Martin 
Luther King Way back to Market Street -- the turnout in largely black Southeast 
San Diego was 25.5%, the lowest of any neighborhood in the city and 11 
percentage points below the citywide average. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows a complete apathy and complacency that this community should be 
ashamed of," said the Rev. George Walker Smith, a former city school board 
president and founder of the Catfish Club, a politically potent black leaders' 
weekly luncheon forum. "We have only ourselves to blame for a lot of our 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, suggest that a greater share of that blame is attributable to 
the actions -- or inaction -- of the area's white majority, which generally 
hews to a conservative, Republican line in its political and business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't divorce this issue from the fact that San Diego is one of the most 
-- if not the most -- conservative big cities in America," said George 
Mitrovich, president of the San Diego City Club and a longtime political 
activist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poor Track Record 
</P>
<P>
No Democratic presidential candidate since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944 has 
carried San Diego County, and local Democratic or liberal causes have generally 
fared little better. 
</P>
<P>
There is one black on the eight-member San Diego City Council and one on the 
five-member San Diego County Board of Supervisors -- and no Latinos on either. 
The seven-member Board of Port Commissioners that made last week's 
controversial decision on the convention center consists of seven white men. 
Though such numbers are not totally out of line with blacks' percentage of the 
overall population, the paucity of black elected officials has exacerbated 
their other political difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that a "pattern of prejudice" has been evident in the convention center 
dispute and other recent controversies, Daniel Weber, a lawyer and immediate 
past president of the NAACP's San Diego branch, contends that the level of 
racism here is "well above the norm" of other major cities. San Diego leaders, 
he charges, often display "a plantation mentality, a paternalistic attitude of, 
'We know best.' " 
</P>
<P>
Added Bates aide Stevens: "San Diego is a great place to practice racism." 
</P>
<P>
A diametrically opposite perspective comes from San Diego Chamber of Commerce 
President Lee Grissom. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't see that at all. I see so many positive contacts between the 
races that the instances where that doesn't happen are isolated exceptions." 
</P>
<P>
As evidence, he points to the chamber's plans to help raise $250,000 for the 
King memorial in Balboa Park and another $500,000 for an annual scholarship 
fund in King's name. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Is Problem Masked? 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, contend that racial disputes are neither as rare nor as 
inconsequential as some city boosters suggest. The relative surface calm in 
black-white relations, they say, masks deep underlying strains. At least one 
City Council member received a death threat after voting for the convention 
center name change, and last week's Port District hearing saw numerous speakers 
descend into bigotry and racial stereotypes to make their points. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Hedgecock, the former San Diego mayor who now plays host to a popular 
phone-in radio talk show, said he was distressed by the virulence of callers on 
both sides of the convention center debate. 
</P>
<P>
"To most white callers, King was a communist sympathizer and womanizer who 
doesn't deserve to have his name on any building," Hedgecock said. "Blacks, 
meanwhile, believe that whites will use any excuse to block any plan to honor a 
hero who is recognized worldwide but whose skin color prevents him from being 
properly recognized in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
The extremity of those attitudes illuminates the deep racial divisions in San 
Diego, as well as a deterioration in the dialogue between the races, according 
to the Rev. Ellis Casson, one of the city's most prominent black ministers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry that we've reached a point in San Diego where people say, 'If you 
disagree with me, you're a bigot,' " Casson said. "Because that's not always 
the case. Blacks and whites can disagree for reasons other than racism. But 
it's sad that we're back at that fork in the road again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Getting to Real Reasons 
</P>
<P>
That "fork in the road" has often prompted impassioned advocates to veer off on 
sharply divergent rhetorical paths in debates over the recent racial 
controversies, with their differences being framed in acerbic us-versus-them 
terminology. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, did a white City Council fire Murray because its members had 
trouble dealing with a black manager, as some suggest, or did the dismissal 
stem from management differences that would not have raised an eyebrow had 
Murray been white? 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, despite Penn's acquittal in the fatal shooting of one white 
policeman and the wounding of another officer and a civilian, there are those 
who still think of him as a hot-tempered black youth who got away with killing 
a cop. Others, however, agree with two juries' judgment that Penn acted in 
self-defense while being unnecessarily beaten by a racist white policeman. 
</P>
<P>
And, did the Market Street and convention center decisions stem from racism, or 
from legitimate concerns such as, in the former case, worries about saddling 
businesses with the cost and inconvenience of changing addresses? 
</P>
<P>
The answers, many argue, probably fall somewhere between the two extremes -- 
and may even be largely irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
Debates over individuals' motivations and the extent of racism in San Diego 
obscure the critical facet of each of the recent controversies, said Roy 
Brooks, a USD law professor who recently completed a book on racial relations. 
Instead of getting mired in that perhaps-insoluble morass, Brooks said, the 
focus should be on the "racial subordination" that results from those actions, 
not the causal mind sets or reasons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Blacks Have Been Hurt' 
</P>
<P>
"We should look not at a person's motivations but at what happens as a result 
of his actions," Brooks said. "Who's helped or who's getting hurt? That's the 
key. It doesn't matter if discrimination is intentional or stems from 
prejudice. It just matters that it occurs. And in San Diego, it's pretty 
obvious that it's blacks who have been hurt." 
</P>
<P>
As occurred after the previous disputes, last week's contretemps touched off 
hand-wringing among local leaders over whether such incidents might warp the 
city's self-image and sully its national reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Wes Pratt, the city's sole black council member, said he has been embarrassed 
by questions in other cities about San Diego's repeated failures to honor King. 
Other prominent local blacks describe similar experiences. 
</P>
<P>
However, even national black organizations with arguably the greatest psychic 
stake in the issue apparently have not followed the latest controversy closely. 
Spokesmen for the NAACP in Baltimore and the Martin Luther King Center for 
Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta were unaware of the convention center name 
debate or Stevens' subsequent boycott call. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason and others, concern over the city's getting a black eye appear 
both premature and exaggerated. Significantly, a computer check of 10 major 
newspapers throughout the country showed that none carried stories about this 
week's flap. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego isn't well-enough known nationally to get a black eye," said UCSD 
political scientist Sam Popkin. "The unfortunate thing is . . . maybe it 
deserves one." 
</P>
<P>

A coalition of conservation groups urged the Bush Administration to spend $781 
million next year to buy land that might otherwise be lost to developers in and 
around national preserves in 46 states. The money would come from the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, which is largely funded with money from oil-drilling 
on the federally owned outer continental shelf, the coalition said. The 
purchase of land under the fund fell under former President Ronald Reagan, from 
$509 million in 1980 to $206 million this year. President Bush has recommended 
keeping spending at $206 million for the next fiscal year. Among the 
recommendations is the purchase of 5,000 acres in Zuma, Trancas and Corral 
canyons and elsewhere in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area 
for $30 million.

Pentagon plans call for closing Mather Air Force Base in four years, but 
cleaning up hazardous waste there will take at least 30 years, according to Air 
Force documents. The documents, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, 
show that the commission that recommended the base's closure did not determine 
how toxic waste cleanup would affect the sale and conversion of Mather to other 
uses. Nor did the commission conduct an environmental review of its plan to 
move Mather's navigator training school to Beale Air Force Base 40 miles north 
of Sacramento, even though its charter required such a review, according to the 
records. The records also reveal that the panel did not study the effect of 
closing Mather's hospital on medical treatment for the 43,000 military retirees 
in the Sacramento area. Mather is one of 86 military installations nationwide 
that the commission recommended be closed as a cost-saving measure.

The Bush Administration and Congress were criticized for failing to fill top 
government health jobs. "Almost four months after the elections, we are still 
wondering who will be named to the post of presidential science adviser," Dr. 
James H. Sammons, AMA executive vice president, told the American Medical 
Assn.'s National Leadership Conference in Chicago, "and we don't have an 
assistant secretary of defense for health at the Pentagon." Vacancies delay 
progress on health programs and put the executive branch at a disadvantage in 
dealing with Congress on legislation, said Dr. James C. Todd, AMA deputy vice 
president.

NEWSMAKERS: A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE, PLAYWRIGHT MISSES OPENING NIGHT

 -- The play's the thing, but with the two one-act plays of Czechoslovak 
playwright Vaclav Havel currently being staged in Warsaw, there's added drama. 
Film maker Feliks Falk, who is directing "The Audience" and "The Protest," 
which depict man's struggle against authority, said that rehearsals began in 
January and that Havel had been invited to attend the opening over the weekend. 
However, Havel, whose plays are prohibited in Czechoslovakia, could not attend, 
because he is serving a nine-month sentence in a Prague prison for inciting 
citizens to participate in a banned demonstration and obstructing police 
officers. "It's just a coincidence that Havel is in prison. For us and for the 
actors, of course, the performance is very important because of Havel," Falk 
said. Havel's plays had been banned in Poland since 1981, when authorities 
declared martial law. But displaying the new sense of accommodation in Poland 
today, Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski attended the opening performance 
-- sitting five rows away from Adam Michnik, a leading Polish opposition 
activist. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Army Sgt. Lee Nelson is getting a lot of attention these days -- and he's 
not liking it. He says he'll quit the service, "if they let me." But it's not 
because of a problem. Nelson's desire to become a civilian stems from a 
windfall -- he's won Lotto America's top prize of $16 million, the most ever 
won since the game began in 1987. Stationed at the Pentagon, Nelson, 29, said 
winning the lottery hasn't changed his routine. "I got up, went to work, spent 
my lunch hour at the gym, came home and had dinner," he said. Nelson, whose 
enlistment is up June 5, said he fears the notoriety more than anything. 
Besides the District of Columbia, states in Lotto America are Iowa, Kansas, 
Missouri, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia.

 -- For breakfast, it will be coffee and stale bread. For lunch, bread, 
vegetable soup and water. Not a very nourishing diet for university students. 
But to those at the University of Dayton, Ohio, it will be the diet of choice. 
This week, a group of collegians will get a firsthand look at life on campus 
streets, as seen through the eyes of the homeless -- queuing up in soup kitchen 
lines for their meager meals. Sister Nancy Bramlage, coordinator of the 
University of Dayton's Office of Justice, Peace and Community Outreach, said: 
"What we want to do is first of all raise the awareness of students that there 
is the growing problem in the United States with the homeless and also give 
them a little bit of an experience of what it must be like -- even to a tiny 
extent -- to be homeless." JAMES MARNELL

Chicago's Acting Mayor Eugene Sawyer and his chief Democratic rival, Cook 
County State's Atty. Richard M. Daley, sprinted to the finish of a hotly 
contested primary race in the nation's third-largest city. Despite holding a 
lead in the polls, Daley, son of legendary "Boss" Richard J. Daley, who ruled 
the city for 21 years, crisscrossed the city with less than 48 hours to go 
until the polls open Tuesday. Daley picked up endorsements from Jewish Voters 
for All Chicago and the Jewish Committee for Responsible Government. Sawyer, 
who 14 months ago succeeded the late Harold Washington, the city's first black 
mayor, doubled Daley's pace on the second-to-last day of the campaign -- 
scheduling more than a dozen appearances citywide.

More than 15,000 people marched in London to protest British plans for four 
possible routes for a high-speed rail link between the capital and the English 
Channel tunnel, now under construction, that will link Britain to France. 
Groups set up by residents of rural southeast England to oppose each of the 
plans handed in letters of protest at Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 
office. People who live near the proposed routes maintain that the rail link 
will hurt the environment, be a noisy eyesore and lower property values. The 
tunnel is due to open in 1993, and rail links carrying trains at speeds of up 
to 180 m.p.h. are planned between London and Paris.

Former Sen. Norris Cotton, who earned a reputation as a laconic, fiercely 
independent and conscientious Yankee statesman in three decades in Congress, 
has died of pneumonia at age 88. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton, who called himself a "rock-ribbed conservative and proud of it," died 
Friday at his home, said a spokeswoman for Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center 
in Hanover. 
</P>
<P>
"He embodied the substance and character of the state and people he served for 
so many years," said Sen. Warren Rudman (R-N.H.). "The death of Norris Cotton 
marks the passage of a great New Hampshire statesman and the end of an era." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Yankee Statesmanship' 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Judd Gregg ordered state flags lowered to half-staff in memory of Cotton, 
who he said "represented the best of Yankee statesmanship." 
</P>
<P>
Former President Richard M. Nixon called Cotton "one of my closest friends in 
Washington" in a statement issued from his home in Saddle Brook, N.J. Cotton 
and Nixon became friends when both were sworn in as freshman representatives in 
1946. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton, a Republican, went to the Senate in 1954 after winning an election to 
fill the two remaining years of the late Sen. Charles Tobey's term. On Aug. 4, 
1974, the day Nixon resigned the presidency, Cotton was among those the 
President phoned to say goodby. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the saddest day of my life," Cotton recalled. But he said he was 
relieved Nixon had quit and saved him the agony of judging his friend in a 
Senate impeachment. Cotton's first vote as a senator had been a vote to censure 
Sen. Joseph McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton retired from the Senate in 1974, but returned for about six weeks the 
following year while voters settled a disputed election. 
</P>

Bellhop, Dishwasher 
</P>
<P>
The Warren native came from a poor family, and paid for his education at 
Phillips Exeter Academy, Connecticut's Wesleyan University and George 
Washington University Law School by waiting on tables, washing dishes and 
working as a bellhop in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton began his political career at age 22 when he was elected to the state 
House of Representatives. He later served as a prosecutor, judge and Speaker of 
the New Hampshire House. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton's political headquarters was the Lebanon firehouse, which he called his 
"club." There, he would play cribbage and chat with a steady stream of farmers, 
businessmen, workers and bankers. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton's first wife, Ruth, died at age 85 in 1978 after 51 years of marriage. 
They had no children. In 1980, Cotton married Eleanor Coolidge Brown, his 
longtime housekeeper, who survives him.

JAPAN'S INFLUENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to letters (Feb. 17) on Japan seeking world influence: 
</P>
<P>
Some letter writers seem to have short memories, or don't know their history. 
The war with Japan was the direct result of trade disagreements between our two 
countries. The Japanese do not spend money on defense because they were 
forbidden to do so by the United States after World War II. So, while they 
became strong economically, we began to weaken because we spent our life's 
blood on the military. What do we have to show for it? Nothing but trouble.

I appreciated your special section Toward Equality. You are doing a public

hope that you will continue this service and cover other areas of concern and 
public values. There is so much on TV and in the papers which destroys 
traditional values that inserts like this are a refreshing sight.

CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new snapshot of the children of California is a sort of double exposure. Some 
live in circumstances that offer a future with limitless horizons. Others 
inhabit a gloomy world of inadequate medical care and poor schooling whose 
future includes low expectations and often violent death. The challenge for 
policy-makers is to forge a brighter future for all of them. 
</P>
<P>
Many California children are doing better than ever, according to a report by 
Policy Analysis for California Education. Their parents think of them as 
well-off. They are in good health, eat nutritious food and don't go to bed 
hungry. More of them than ever finish high school. 
</P>
<P>
But the outlook is less rosy for a large and growing segment of the state's 
children. Nearly one in four lives in poverty. One child in six was born in 
another country, and may face language barriers and other problems. And their 
numbers are enormous: In another 10 years one American child in eight will live 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
One more revealing statistic among many: Slightly more than half of 
California's poor children live with both parents, of whom at least one has a 
job. That obviously means that the working parent isn't earning enough to 
provide minimum needs. Increasing the minimum wage now and improving education 
so that people can get better jobs in the long run are vital steps if these 
families are to escape their poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Trends covered by the report can be reversed, but it will take coordinated 
effort over many years by governors, legislators, child-advocacy groups and 
corporate leaders. It will require a cohesive state policy for children to 
replace the present hodgepodge of programs. Any state effort would also benefit 
from greater federal spending to help improve day-care programs, expand Head 
Start and extend coverage of the extraordinarily successful nutrition program 
aimed at pregnant women and their young children. 
</P>
<P>
The need for a comprehensive policy is perhaps seen most clearly when one looks 
at teen-age pregnancies. In 1986 teen-agers had nearly 11% of all the babies 
born in California. The state has the second-highest teen-age pregnancy rate in 
the nation. And increasingly those teen-agers are not married: In a decade and 
a half the percentage has almost doubled, going from 32% unmarried in 1970 to 
62% in 1986. Teen-agers are less likely to seek medical care early in their 
pregnancies, they may be poorly nourished, and as a result their babies may not 
flourish. Teen-age mothers face reduced employment prospects. They may not 
finish school themselves, and their own lack of education may handicap them in 
helping their children -- who then fall behind and risk the same cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Throwing money at some of the problems really will help. For example, there is 
a clear link between improved prenatal care and healthier babies. But many 
women cannot afford extensive, and expensive, care. So last year the 
Legislature wisely expanded the eligibility limits for Medi-Cal coverage for 
prenatal care, and Gov. George Deukmejian signed the measure. Now the state 
government must make sure that women know about the change. 
</P>
<P>
The state must concentrate on such prevention programs to reduce the costs of 
curbing the school dropout rate, helping troubled adolescents, making sure that 
day-care providers are decently paid and trained, and helping reduce teen-age 
pregnancies. In this context the governor's plan to eliminate the state 
family-planning office is shameful. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses have a role as well in providing child care and parental leave. 
Business leaders are increasingly aware of their stake in a well-educated 
citizenry; they must tell state government that they are willing to help pay 
for it. The public can get involved as well through a new advocacy group called 
Children Now that is trying to mobilize support to improve children's lives. 
</P>
<P>
Children, it is said, have no clout in Sacramento because they have no vote. 
But their parents vote, as do their grandparents, teachers, social workers and 
doctors. Businessmen vote, too, and they must join the others in voting for 
government committed to expanding the horizons of all children.

I didn't feel the article "Putting 'X' into Xmas: A More Sensible Approach" was 
representative of myself or most of the other Jewish people I know. It is true 
the December holidays are difficult but it is possible to walk a tightrope of 
emotions between Hanukkah and Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
I appreciate the desire of teachers and merchants to include Jewish children 
and consumers in the holiday spirit, and I don't mind my children being able to 
make different art projects and sing Hanukkah songs along with their Christian 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
Our neighbors are reaching out to us and attempting to include us while 
allowing us to celebrate our own beliefs in schools and communities. I feel 
this is a very positive approach to coexisting and maintaining our special 
heritage.

OPENING THE DOOR FOR CARCINOGENS; 
</P>
<P>
ASSAULTS ON NATION'S FOOD-SAFETY LAWS MULTIPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAMUEL S. EPSTEIN and JAY FELDMAN, Samuel S. Epstein, MD, is a professor of 
occupational and environmental medicine at the University of Illinois Medical 
Center. Jay Feldman is national coordinator of the National Coalition Against 
the Misuse of Pesticides, based in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As conservationist William K. Reilly takes over as Environmental Protection 
Agency administrator, the agency is embarking on a new policy that opens the 
nation's food supplies to a multitude of carcinogenic pesticides. Announced in 
the waning days of the Reagan Administration, this policy gives the highly 
politicized EPA broad discretion to allow contamination of food with 
carcinogenic residues of "negligible risk." The policy has already been 
exercised in recent EPA decisions allowing continued use on fruits and 
vegetables of the carcinogenic growth regulator Alar and the fungicide captan. 
</P>
<P>
Before the new EPA policy, carcinogenic pesticides in food were regulated under 
dual standards of the 1954 Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. Residues on raw 
agricultural commodities were subject to discretionary tolerances in accordance 
with commercial benefit considerations of the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and 
Rodenticide Act. But, under a 1958 amendment, the so-called Delaney clause, 
there was an absolute ban -- zero tolerance -- on residues in processed foods, 
regardless of commercial benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The scientific basis for Delaney has been under concerted attack by the 
agrichemical industry since its enactment; it has been repeatedly examined by 
committees and authorities with expertise in carcinogenesis, which have 
unequivocally concluded that there is no way of setting safe levels for any 
carcinogen. 
</P>
<P>
In deliberate violation of that law, EPA has failed to ban residues of most 
carcinogenic pesticides, particularly those registered before 1978, in 
processed foods. The agency asserts that the pesticides had not been adequately 
tested, although their continued use was made conditional on such retesting by 
1972 amendments to the pesticide law. 
</P>
<P>
To resolve its dilemma, the EPA adopted the new standard allowing "negligible 
risk" tolerances for all carcinogenic pesticides on all foods. The basis for 
this standard was largely derived from a 1987 report by the National Academy of 
Sciences, which was funded and dominated by agrichemical and food industry 
interests to the near exclusion of expertise in cancer prevention. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy trivializes cancer prevention for the sake of a marketplace 
definition of pesticide "benefits." The negligible-risk standard is targeted 
only at residues of "active" ingredients of individual pesticides. It does not 
take into consideration the substantial risks from carcinogenic inert pesticide 
ingredients, contaminants and impurities that may not have been disclosed. Nor 
does it consider the cumulative and unpredictable effectsof numerous 
carcinogenic pesticides in the total diet, in drinking water and in the air. 
</P>
<P>
This policy also ignores risks from carcinogenic food additives, coal-tar dye 
colors, animal-feed additives, including hormones, and food-wrapping chemicals 
and contaminants, which the FDA allows in food in flagrant contravention of the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
More fundamentally, the negligible-risk policy is based on quantitative risk 
assessment, which attempts to estimate cancer risks to humans from animal 
tests. Quantitative risk assessment is at best a pseudoscience and at worst a 
smoke screen for the numbers used to prop up politically predetermined 
decisions, such as EPA's recent downgrading of risk estimates for the herbicide 
2,4-D, the termite insecticide chlordane and the contaminant 2,3,7,8-dioxin, 
the most potent known carcinogen. The results of risk assessment for any 
carcinogen can vary up to 10 million-fold, depending on which mathematical 
model is arbitrarily selected for assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the new standard is a powerful disincentive to reduce the 
1-billion-pound annual agricultural pesticide usage, and a disincentive to the 
development and application of alternative pest management or organic farming 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
EPA's failure to implement the pesticide food-safety law must be corrected, and 
the law must not be emasculated, as it would be by the new policy and by past 
legislation introduced by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and Sen. Edward 
M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), now slated for reintroduction in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Delaney law must be strengthened and uniformly applied to all 
carcinogenic pesticide ingredients in processed foods. Tolerances on raw 
agricultural commodities must be progressively reduced with a mandated zero 
goal. Until then, state and local initiatives must be developed to protect 
consumers, including right-to-know laws on pesticide use and residues, and 
supermarket residue-testing and certification programs. 
</P>
<P>
The nation is losing the war against cancer, which has reached epidemic 
proportions, now striking one in three people. Consumers nationwide will expect 
Congress and the Bush Administration to take early and vigorous action to 
ensure that we can eat safely while reducing our substantial risks of 
preventable cancer.

BE MOST WARY OF NATURE'S OWN PESTICIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE N. AMES, Bruce N. Ames is chairman of the department of biochemistry 
and director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Center 
at UC Berkeley.

<TEXT>
<P>
The bad news is that our plant foods contain carcinogens. Carrots, comfrey tea, 
celery, parsley, parsnips, mushrooms, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, mustard, 
basil, fennel, orange and grapefruit juices, pepper, cauliflower, broccoli, 
raspberry and pineapple contain natural pesticides that cause cancer in rats or 
mice and that are present at levels ranging from 70 ppb (parts per billion) to 
4,000,000 ppb -- levels that are enormously higher than the amounts of man-made 
pesticide residues in plant foods. 
</P>
<P>
All plants produce their own natural pesticides to protect themselves against 
fungi, insects and predators such as man. Tens of thousands of these natural 
pesticides have been discovered, and every species of plant contains its own 
set of toxins, usually a few dozen. When plants are stressed or damaged, such 
as during a pest attack, they increase their natural pesticide levels many 
fold, occasionally to levels that are acutely toxic to humans. 
</P>
<P>
Only a tiny percentage of these natural pesticides has been tested in animal 
cancer tests, but of those that have been tested, the percentage that turns out 
to be carcinogenic is about as high as for man-made pesticides (about 30%). The 
same appears to be true for natural teratogens (agents that cause birth 
defects). It is highly probable that almost every plant product in the 
supermarket contains natural carcinogens and teratogens. 
</P>
<P>
The pesticides that we are eating are 99.99% all natural (we eat 10,000 times 
more natural than man-made pesticides). Most natural pesticides, like man-made 
pesticides, are relatively new to the modern diet, because most of our plant 
foods were brought to Europe within the last 500 years from the Americas, 
Africa and Asia (and vice versa). 
</P>
<P>
In response to the environmentalist campaign about tiny traces of man-made 
pesticides, plant breeders are active in developing varieties that are 
naturally pest resistant. However, the primary way plant breeders are able to 
increase natural resistance to pests is to breed plants with increased levels 
of natural pesticides. It should be no surprise, then, that a newly introduced 
variety of insect-resistant potato had to be withdrawn from the market, due to 
acute toxicity to humans caused by much higher levels of the teratogens 
solanine and chaconine than are normally present in potatoes. Similarly, a new 
variety of insect-resistant celery recently introduced in the United States had 
to be withdrawn after it caused widespread outbreaks of dermatitis due to a 
concentration of carcinogens at 9,000 ppb rather than the usual 900 ppb. 
</P>
<P>
Many more such cases are likely to crop up -- they are undetected as yet due to 
lack of immediate observable effects -- because there is a fundamental 
trade-off between nature's pesticides and man-made pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that it now appears from much recent work on the mechanisms of 
carcinogenesis that the risk of cancer is negligible from carcinogens at levels 
far below the maximum tolerated dose given to rats and mice in cancer trials. I 
am not even very concerned about the cancer risk from allyl isothiocyanate, a 
natural carcinogen present in cabbage at 40,000 ppb and in brown mustard at 
900,000 ppb, because I, along with most other leading scientists, am very 
skeptical about all of these worst-case, low-dose extrapolations from high-dose 
animal tests. 
</P>
<P>
What must be emphasized is that "the dose makes the poison." For example, 
consuming five alcoholic drinks per day is clearly a risk factor in humans for 
cancer, and in pregnant women for giving birth to mentally retarded babies. 
However, there is no convincing evidence as yet that consuming one alcoholic 
drink per day is dangerous. As another example, sunlight can cause cancer, but 
the evidence suggests that the carcinogenic danger is from repeated sunburns. 
In fact, ultraviolet light at low doses induces a tan, which protects against 
the burning of skin by ultraviolet light. 
</P>
<P>
My own estimate for the number of cases of cancer or birth defects caused by 
man-made pesticide residues in food or water pollution -- usually at levels 
hundreds of thousands or millions of times below that given to rats or mice -- 
is close to zero. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency are 
doing an adequate job of protecting our food supply from carcinogenic 
contaminants and are much more credible than the activists lawyers with the 
Natural Resources Defense Council who spend their time wooing the media with 
scientifically unfounded claims about the dangers of pesticides, but who have 
never assembled a knowledgeable board of scientific advisers. The cost to the 
American public from such misplaced efforts is enormous, both in terms of a 
very large hidden tax on our economy and in terms of lives lost by diverting 
our resources from real public-health problems. 
</P>
<P>
In order to minimize cancer and the other degenerative diseases of aging (which 
are associated with our constantly increasing life expectancy), we need the 
knowledge that will come from further basic scientific research. Yet we are 
spending $70 billion per year on pollution because of wildly exaggerated fears 
and only $9 billion per year on all of our basic scientific research.

KINGS PLAY WELL DEFENSIVELY, BUT ONLY GET A 1-1 TIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the Kings have a goaltender whom they believe will keep the puck out 
of their net, they've stopped scoring. 
</P>
<P>
For the second straight game, in front of a crowd of 19,040 at the Meadowlands, 
the National Hockey League's highest-scoring team was limited to a single goal 
Sunday night in a 1-1 tie with the New Jersey Devils. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, though, insisted afterward that they are not at all concerned with 
this strange turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to have scored one more goal tonight," Coach Robbie Ftorek said, 
"but we're very pleased with keeping New Jersey down to one goal." 
</P>
<P>
As Ftorek was quick to point out, the Kings have not allowed an even-strength 
goal in two games, including a 4-1 loss to the Edmonton Oilers last Friday 
night at Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
"They're really buckling down and doing the job that we've asked them to do," 
Ftorek said of his players, who have won only two of their last 12 road games. 
"So, we're very pleased in that regard. We're creating scoring opportunities 
off the work we're doing. We're just not putting them in. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing a much sounder game than we had been." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, creating opportunities wasn't the Kings' problem. 
</P>
<P>
Converting them was. 
</P>
<P>
Devil goaltender Chris Terreri, a rookie making only his second start of the 
season, made several spectacular saves in pursuit of his first NHL victory, 
allowing only a second-period goal by Dave Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
John MacLean pulled the Devils even less than five minutes later, scoring a 
power-play goal on a 20-foot shot from the left circle that sailed through the 
legs of goaltender Kelly Hrudey, who otherwise played well for the Kings in his 
second start since being acquired last Wednesday in a trade with the New York 
Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Terreri got a hand from the officials, who swallowed their whistles in 
the overtime period, as is customary in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
The most obvious infraction of the rules was made by Tom Kurvers of the Devils, 
who grabbed Wayne Gretzky in front of the Devil net and threw the King center 
to the ice with about 2 minutes 50 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
When no whistle was blown and play continued, Gretzky made a beeline toward 
linesman Pat DaPuzzo, giving him an earful as they skated up the ice. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky was still angry as the players and officials skated off afterward, 
making sure that all three officials got a piece of his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Was his anger justified? 
</P>
<P>
"I can't answer for him," Ftorek said. "You'll have to ask him that question." 
</P>
<P>
Should a call have been made? 
</P>
<P>
"I can't answer that question, either," said Ftorek, apparently weary of being 
fined. "I think the referee called (the game) to the best of his ability. He 
didn't call it, so it must not have been a penalty." 
</P>
<P>
And what did Gretzky think of the play by Kurvers? 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have his stick, so he grabbed the next closest thing," Gretzky said 
of the Devil defenseman, who dropped his stick as he grappled with Gretzky. 
"But I guess you learn after 10 years that in the last few minutes of a game, 
that's not going to be called. It's as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, in fact, even insisted that he wasn't angry. 
</P>
<P>
"I was more frustrated than anything else," he said. "I had an opportunity to 
go to the net, and I had the guy beat." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time as a member of the Kings, Gretzky was held without a point 
for a second consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
And for the eighth straight game, dating back to Nov. 19, 1983, when he said 
the Devils were "ruining hockey and putting a Mickey Mouse operation on the 
ice," Gretzky failed to score in the Brendan Byrne Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, though, said he was pleased with the direction that the more 
tight-checking Kings seem to be headed. 
</P>
<P>
"In order for us to win, we have to play better defensively," he said. "We're 
not going to go anywhere if we score eight goals a game and give up nine. We've 
played very well the last couple of games." 
</P>
<P>
He smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"Kelly's pretty good, too," he said of Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Hrudey seemingly has had little trouble fitting in, although it's clear 
that he still needs time to become fully acclimated. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he was concerned about the Kings' lack of productivity, the 
accommodating Hrudey said that he wasn't and added: "I just can't envision Luc 
Robitaille, Mario Lemieux, Bernie Nicholls and so on down the line being held 
off the board for too many games in a row." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, he meant Gretzky and not Lemieux? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah," he said. "Sorry." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Owner Bruce McNall of the Kings said Sunday that officials of the Minnesota 
North Stars probably weren't serious this month when they offered him $25 
million for Wayne Gretzky during the All-Star break. "Sometimes it's easy to 
say those things when you know the other guy isn't going to take you up on it," 
he said. McNall acquired Gretzky from the Edmonton Oilers last summer for $15 
million, two players and three first-round draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
McNall, General Manager Rogie Vachon and Coach Robbie Ftorek flew from Edmonton 
to Minneapolis Saturday to watch Robb Stauber, the University of Minnesota 
goaltender who was college hockey's player of the year last season and whose 
rights are owned by the Kings. Stauber apparently wasn't called on to make many 
tough saves Saturday night in a 7-1 victory over Colorado College. "We're glad 
we saw warmups so we could see him take some shots," Ftorek said. . . . The 
Kings are 2-7-3 on the road since beating the Vancouver Canucks, 5-2, at 
Vancouver on Dec. 23. . . . Kelly Hrudey, asked to evaluate his play after 
making 33 saves: "Steady. That's all. I want to be steady night in and night 
out, so the team knows what it's getting."

RUTIGLIANO WELCOMES THE CHANCE TO COACH FUNDAMENTALIST FOOTBALL, WHICH PREACHES 
MORE THAN JUST BLOCKING AND TACKLING

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In all the lore of Notre Dame, nobody remembers a flood sweeping through the 
football team's practice facility and carrying all the equipment downstream, 
thus ending the season three games early. 
</P>
<P>
At Brigham Young they do not tell stories of the players sleeping in tents. 
</P>
<P>
Nor can the Oral Roberts basketball program wax nostalgic about a training 
table that boasted of powdered eggs and tuna fish sandwiches, apparently in its 
entirety. 
</P>
<P>
So you have to hand it to Liberty University, evangelist Jerry Falwell's 
"spiritual boot camp." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1971 with just 250 students, just a Bible school really, it has come 
to acquire low-slung buildings on campus acreage and university accreditation, 
a broad athletic program and, most important, a colorful past. It hasn't been 
around long enough to have alumni to speak of or to become much of a rival to 
other Christian institutions, yet there are already some Division I-A stories, 
such as the time the players painted a dormitory hot pink. 
</P>
<P>
Of course the real reason you have to hand it to Liberty University, by now a 
campus of some 5,000 students, is that it has a future as well. Two months ago, 
it capped a successful foray into National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division 
I-AA football by firing its coach after an 8-3 season and hiring Sam 
Rutigliano, one-time coach of the year in the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Rutigliano! 
</P>
<P>
Falwell, who has often joked he would like to beat Notre Dame, is no longer 
getting a laugh out of his ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
"He made that claim when he first started," said Scott Tolley, sportswriter for 
the Lynchburg News and Daily Advance who has been watching this story develop 
over the years. "And we thought he was joking at the time." No joke. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, a wealthy donor built Hancock Athletic Center, with major 
league offices and a vast weight-training facility. 
</P>
<P>
This winter, another donor provided funds to scrape some red dirt off Candler's 
Mountain -- they've chosen high ground this time -- and prepare it for a 
12,000-seat football stadium, which can be expanded to 35,000. 
</P>
<P>
Early last week, they signed a hotshot high school quarterback from San Diego. 
Days later they filled an open date with Eastern Michigan, a Division I-A 
school, their first. 
</P>
<P>
And so the Baptists throw down the gauntlet. Falwell's Fundamentalists are 
clearly up to something. It's not exactly "My religion can beat yours," but 
rather a new slant on missionary zeal. The Catholics and Mormons were able to 
witness at bowl games after last season, so how were the Baptists represented? 
It may or may not work but admit it, you'd never heard of Liberty University 
before this story, had you? 
</P>
<P>
This is all about exposure and they make no bones about it. 
</P>
<P>
Rutigliano, for example, is an inspired choice for this program even though 
they didn't exactly need a new coach. Morgan Hout got the Flames through an 8-3 
season in an upgraded Division I-AA schedule, but he couldn't get them what 
Falwell really needed. 
</P>
<P>
And what would that be, anyway? It would be attention. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rutigliano, settling back in a vast office, looking at a visitor who had 
just traveled 2,500 miles, "You came, didn't you?" 
</P>
<P>
Falwell is of the firm belief, one of several evidently, that sports is a great 
way to spread the gospel. The example of Notre Dame looms large in his mind, to 
judge by the repeated references to it. He is said to be a considerable sports 
freak, attending all home games at the very least, but his vision apparently 
extends far beyond his own fandom. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to go big time," said Rutigliano, 56, former coach of the Cleveland 
Browns. "Because, bottom line, he wants to spread the message of what Liberty 
University is all about. Sports is a powerful force. He wants to spread the 
word, save some souls." 
</P>
<P>
If this happens, it will be because of Rutigliano and against some long odds. 
Although Falwell's commitment is very real -- the recruiting budget was beefed 
up from $17,000 to $100,000 -- it will be a long time before Liberty University 
can compete with Notre Dame. Not all the recruiting money in the world can help 
land some blue chippers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not for everybody," Rutigliano said. "A kid asks me, 'Coach, do I have to 
give up beer?' " 
</P>
<P>
That's the least of it. If he comes to Liberty University, according to a 
handbook called the Liberty Way, he'll give up going to movies, slouching in 
blue jeans and any night on the town later than 11:30. 
</P>
<P>
But Rutigliano is bound to be a powerful force, whether recruiting or on the 
sidelines. Whatever you say of his experience, which was a 47-52 record in 6 
1/2 years with the Browns, it was NFL experience. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids think I'm special, whether I am or not," he said, shrugging. "They 
tend to listen." 
</P>
<P>
Not too many schools, on any level, can present a coach with NFL experience. 
Why, one of the few we can think of is Lou Holtz . . . at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
It makes sense that Rutigliano can help Liberty University in upgrading its 
program. But what can Liberty University do for Sam Rutigliano? 
</P>
<P>
The marriage is not as odd as it might first appear. Rutigliano, who admits he 
may be better known for his drug-rehabilitation program with the Browns than 
for his record, probably couldn't coach anywhere but Liberty University. It 
turns out this is the job he was reborn for. 
</P>
<P>
After he was let go by the Browns in 1984, he embarked on what he calls his own 
"mini-ministry." 
</P>
<P>
Deeply religious ever since his 4-year-old daughter was killed in an automobile 
accident in 1962, Rutigliano was using his time to do some broadcasting for NBC 
and ESPN, speak on behalf of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes among other 
causes, and to teach school in the inner city of Cleveland. The TV work was 
terrific -- "They pay you and you don't have to win" -- and the other work was 
satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
Rutigliano was comfortable enough that he could turn down four offers from 
Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
Of coaching again, he said: "I just felt there wasn't a reason to do it. 
Teaching, speaking, doing things I was never able to do as a coach. I went to 
Guadalajara with a pro athletes' outreach group. I took a Division III team to 
New Zealand. I mean, I was doing things I had never done, and I was doing them 
with my wife. I had a normal life. And I was able to see that the leaves 
actually do turn colors in the fall. I was not quick to give that up." 
</P>
<P>
But then Rutigliano was invited to speak at chapel by Falwell. It was just 
another stop on a 50-60 speech-a-year schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very moving experience, seeing 5,000-6,000 kids getting high, but for 
all the right reasons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it took Falwell one more meeting before he could persuade Rutigliano to 
help elevate his program to the big time. 
</P>
<P>
Rutigliano had reservations -- still has some -- about the kind of job this 
would turn out to be. There was an obvious appeal to him. 
</P>
<P>
"This was an alternative," he said, referring to the spreading use of drugs 
around him. 
</P>
<P>
Although his "Inner Circle" program with the Browns was innovative and 
successful, he was becoming overwhelmed by the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"You've gotta realize, we're involved in a way in this country and we're 
losing. We consume $6.8 million an hour on alcohol. If you lump IBM, Chrysler 
and Coca-Cola together, they would not exceed the cocaine industry in this 
country. You come (to Liberty), you can't smoke, drink, everybody's subject to 
random testing. It's not a legalistic thing, but. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
It certainly was an alternative. Rutigliano's professional interest was also 
piqued by Falwell's strange ambition to make Liberty University to the Baptists 
"what Notre Dame is to Catholics and BYU is to the Mormons." And when Falwell 
said they were building a stadium this year, "Well, that was the kicker." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Rutigliano was not so unrealistic as to think that everybody was 
dying to attend a university where, until recently, you couldn't date without a 
chaperon before your junior year. Not to pick on the Sooners, but you doubt 
many of the more famous Oklahoma football players would find this their kind of 
comfort zone. To tell the truth, not many people would survive here. 
</P>
<P>
NCAA drug testing was thought to be extreme, but here it applies to every 
student, not just athletes in bowl games. The kids who come here are probably 
not drawn to vices to begin with. A curriculum that includes mandatory Bible 
survey courses and weekly chapel appeals to a certain kind of student. But 
beyond that they are not allowed much opportunity to explore culture's 
underside. 
</P>
<P>
A young woman working in one of the athletic offices explained the various 
curfews. Some nights it's 10:30, others 11:30. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, you have to understand something about Lynchburg," she said. 
"There's nothing to do at 11:30. At 11:30, they're begging to get back into the 
dorms." 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely nothing to do? 
</P>
<P>
She thinks. "We can hold hands." 
</P>
<P>
Though emphasized, athletics are not so set apart here that the jocks escape 
this atmosphere. Tolley of the local paper said that when a couple of football 
players were kicked out for marijuana use, the news was sufficient that 
Penthouse magazine came sniffing around. But that's about as sensational as 
things get here. The athletes are drawn from the same religious pool as the 
rest of the campus and they live and die by the same rules. 
</P>
<P>
Rutigliano knows there is no sense misrepresenting conditions to the prospects. 
"They'll have a bad experience, they'll leave," he said. So he spells it out. 
</P>
<P>
Down the hall, a soccer coach is making a routine phone check with a recruit. 
His end of the conversation goes like this: "Son, what I'm saying is, Jesus 
Christ died for your sins." 
</P>
<P>
This is probably no less fervid than, say, Barry Switzer's pitch, just a 
different slant is all. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the soccer player was persuaded by anything from the New Testament is 
not known. However, there are people for whom this is a refreshing alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a situation where you're recruiting a limited student, like Air Force, 
Navy, Harvard," Rutigliano explained. "Except, more so here. We've got to 
recruit across the U.S. because we've got to see a lot of kids." 
</P>
<P>
He said he has met with laughs from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
"But other kids want an alternative, don't want to go somewhere where they're 
smoking pot. They want a Christian school and there's more of them than we give 
them credit for. To build this program, we need about three-four blue chippers 
(a year). This year, we hit about two-three." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, he admitted, it's not the blue chipper who is sold on the program, 
but the parents, who regard this as a safe harbor in a murky sea. 
</P>
<P>
"When they visit with their parents, we got a chance," he said. "Parents want 
to send their kids to college, but somewhere where they'll get a chance of 
getting them back. They can come here, marry the girl of their dreams." 
</P>
<P>
That reminds Rutigliano. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, there's a lot of rich guys that have beautiful daughters and want to 
send them here to meet the right guy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As recruiting pitches go, well, we're getting warm. Later on the kids can deal 
with the hand-holding. 
</P>
<P>
For Rutigliano, who was buffeted by real life in the NFL -- players use vast 
amounts of cocaine, owners fire you for starting badly -- this is a refuge as 
well. He admitted it's kind of strict. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids need a chance to ventilate," he conceded. But he'll swallow that 
gladly. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an alternative," he said. "We've gone way too far. The ketchup is out 
of the bottle and we can't put it back in." 
</P>
<P>
Here in Lynchburg, the cap is still screwed on tight. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Falwell may be opening up Pandora's box even as he keeps the 
ketchup bottle sealed. Big-time sports is not necessarily incompatible with a 
virtuous life. But nothing attracts temptation like a football program with 
momentum. Already, Tolley said, there are rumors of steroid use in the athletic 
program. 
</P>
<P>
And pressure? Falwell is regarded as a good sport, a frisky guy who mingles 
easily with his kids. The young woman we met said he's famous for sneaking up 
behind you and scaring you. 
</P>
<P>
"And if you cross in front of his car on campus, he'll honk his horn just to 
make you jump." 
</P>
<P>
His concern does not appear to be the evangelist's game face either. This same 
young woman said that she saw him in the stands at a recent high school 
basketball game but kept her distance. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't approve of my boyfriends," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he appears willing to operate in the cutthroat world of a 
burgeoning sports power. 
</P>
<P>
When Rutigliano told Falwell he wasn't interested in the job until there was an 
actual vacancy, Falwell didn't hesitate to create one. Morgan Hout learned of 
his firing while on a recruiting trip. His secretary gave him the news. Falwell 
shrugged off the resulting controversy and said he just didn't think Hout was 
the man to take the program to the next level. 
</P>
<P>
So the pressure builds. 
</P>
<P>
Rutigliano is not unaware of a master plan. Liberty University means to 
establish an identity in the eastern corridor. 
</P>
<P>
"Play a William &amp; Mary, a Virginia, a James Madison, make your next step, a 
few TV games, build your stadium to 36,000 and move up to Northwestern, 
Stanford," Rutigliano said. 
</P>
<P>
And Notre Dame? 
</P>
<P>
"That's the bull's-eye," Rutigliano said. 
</P>
<P>
And he fully understands his charge. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to win. We have to get people's attention." 
</P>
<P>
In that respect, of course, Liberty University is just like any other school, 
Rutigliano's job just like any other. It's just that, for all their ambition, 
their motives seem decidedly different from the other football programs on the 
make. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine," said Rutigliano, obviously affected by Falwell's vision, "us playing 
in a bowl game someday, winning souls."

SCOTT OSTLER: A KISS-OFF GOODBY AND THEY'RE GONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A gold watch, a hoist o' the cup and a fond farewell to. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tom Landry. 
</P>
<P>
Football is a vicious game off the field, too. The owners and executives can be 
as cold and brutal as an inside linebacker on third and short. 
</P>
<P>
Example: Earlier this month, the Green Bay Packers fired their cheerleaders. It 
was a surprise, because a lot of people figured it was going to be the other 
way around. Many believed that the football team was a mindless distraction, 
and was hurting the attendance at the Sunday cheerleader performances. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, then, nothing is sacred in football. I had a vague feeling that Tom 
Landry's job might be in jeopardy when rich guy Jerry Jones announced that he 
had hired Jimmy Johnson to be his head coach, and then announced that he had 
purchased the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
Landry may have sensed trouble in the offing when Tex Schramm popped into the 
coach's office and said, "Tom, come on down and meet the new owner. Oh, and 
bring your playbook." 
</P>
<P>
Jones drew strong criticism for his timing and insensitivity. After buying the 
team, Landry lovers said, Jones should have waited a day, or a week, or at 
least taken a deep breath, before firing the man who has coached the team for 
29 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But what purpose would've been served by delaying the move, leaving Landry to 
twist in the wind, wrinkling his sport coat? How would that be kinder to 
Landry? And who can blame the new owner for wanting a fresh start, after last 
season's disaster and the team's steady slide in recent years? 
</P>
<P>
Jones isn't the first new owner to bring in his own coach. Sure, Landry was a 
sacred Texas institution, but it's not like Jones fired the Cowboy 
cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Jones indicated there might be a job for Landry in the organization. 
The new owner didn't say exactly what that job might be, but he dropped an 
ominous hint when he said: "Let me tell you this, Jimmy Johnson would be the 
first to tell you he couldn't carry Tom's water bucket." 
</P>
<P>
Florence Griffith Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
There is no truth to the rumor that FloJo was pressured to retire from track 
and field after a random drug test turned up traces of steroids in her 
fingernail polish. 
</P>
<P>
If ever an athlete was a comet streaking across the sky, it is -- was -- FloJo. 
To most of us, Griffith Joyner burst upon the athletic scene only last summer, 
when she became the world's fastest negligee. In Seoul she was as dazzling an 
Olympian as any in memory, if you combine personality and performance. 
</P>
<P>
And now she's gone, faded back into the real world. Considering how greatly she 
improved in such a short time, FloJo may be the first great athlete to have 
retired before her peak. Now we'll never know if she could beat a 10.49 or a 
21.34, but it's scary to think what she could have done if somebody had pushed 
her, if halfway through a race she hadn't been so far ahead she could break 
into a smile and start waving at the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
FloJo's only flaw as a runner was her style. She has too much of it. If she 
wasn't so pretty, the big offers to endorse products and appear on television 
wouldn't have tempted her away from running. 
</P>
<P>
Among other ventures, she has signed to star in a movie, playing the female 
James Bond. You remember Bond -- Agent 007? FloJo, I would guess, will be Agent 
006.83. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Garvey. 
</P>
<P>
First, Garv faded out of baseball because his batting average was too low, and 
now he fades out of politics because his batting average was too high. Go 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey was married once before, to a woman who whispered their most intimate 
problems to a national magazine writer. He was once publicly attacked, right on 
the ball field, by Morganna the Monstrous. Now, after his recent marriage, 
Garvey has revealed that two other women whom he dated claim he caused them to 
become pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
If Margo Adams sues him, Garvey will have completed the grand slam of romance. 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad, because Garvey, even back in his glory days with the Dodgers, was 
one of sport's nicest guys. I never, never saw him refuse an autograph request 
or snub a fan in an airport or hotel lobby, and he was even friendly with 
sportswriters. Some say Garvey's niceness was contrived, but if it was, we 
could use more phonies. 
</P>
<P>
When accused of the latest transgressions, Garvey admitted guilt and offered to 
take full responsibility for the consequences of his actions. This, obviously, 
is a man ill-suited for politics. 
</P>
<P>
He may yet fight back into the political arena, though. It could turn out that 
neither child is his. With Garvey, there is a simple paternity test. If a child 
is born with his or her hair mussed, it's not Garv's. 
</P>
<P>
And even if the bad publicity costs him some potential votes, he seems to be 
building a strong base of future Garvey voters. What do you expect from a guy 
who spent almost every spring of his life in a place called Virile Beach? 
</P>

MIKE DOWNEY: DODGERS TRY AGAIN, FIND CHARM AT THIRD

Doing nothing in Dodgertown. Nothing doing in Dodgertown. No commotion. No 
turmoil. No no-shows. Oh, OK, so Alfredo Griffin is tardy. Visa problems. Or 
MasterCard problems. Something. Yawn. You check it out with General Manager 
Fred Claire anyway. "Must be a slow news day," he says. The man was a 
sportswriter once. He knows slow news when he reads it. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lasorda tries to help. Mister Ragu informs you that Dodger per 
</P>
<P>
ar$ Orel Hershiser and Kirk Gibson have just offered him $20,000 -- seriously, 
10 grand apiece, to be paid to Lasorda's favorite charity -- if the marinara 
addict can undergo withdrawal and lose 20 pounds by the All-Star break. Tommy 
accepts the pepsin challenge. Bang the Tums slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Marshall also tries to help. He creams a home run in batting practice. 
Then he goes into the Gibson Gait. Toward first base Marshall moseys, dragging 
one of his legs beside him as though it were pegged. Around first base he 
limps. At second base he pumps his fist. At third he thrusts it skyward. The 
guy does Gibson better than Gibson. After baseball, he can make a pretty good 
living as a Gibby impersonator. 
</P>
<P>
Camp is calm. 
</P>
<P>
Better still for the Dodgers, third base is calm. Third base's dust has 
settled. Third base is no longer manned by I Don't Know. Third base no longer 
belongs to Grade A grounder-butchers Pete Guerrero or Bill Madlock. Third base 
belongs to Jeff Hamilton, the good-hands man from Michigan, our man from Flint 
-- who, Lasorda wastes no time in proclaiming, just happens to be "the 
best-fielding third baseman in the league today, bar none." 
</P>
<P>
For once, the Dodgers know how hot their corner is. Over five of the last six 
seasons, their Opening Day third baseman has been either Guerrero (1983, 1985, 
1988) or Madlock (1986, 1987) -- both of whom you might remember from the 
mini-series Lonesome Glove. For 1984, by the way, the starter at third was 
German Rivera. You might also remember German. Then again, you might not. 
</P>
<P>
What a mess third base has been. Over their 30 years in Los Angeles, the 
Dodgers have used 76 third basemen. Seventy-six third sackers in the big 
parade. Not once, from 1958 through 1966, did the Dodgers start the same third 
baseman in the season opener. They tried Dick Gray, Jim Baxes, Junior Gilliam, 
Tommy Davis, Daryl Spencer, Ken McMullen, John Werhas and John Kennedy before 
Jim Lefebvre, who made two openers in a row. Then Bob Bailey. Then Bill 
Sudakis. Then Steve Garvey for two years. (That's right -- at third.) Then 
Billy Grabarkewitz. Then McMullen again. Until, finally, Ron Cey. 
</P>
<P>
"The year before Cey took over," Claire recalls, "our third basemen made, I 
believe, 53 errors. Cey cut it to 10." 
</P>
<P>
For a time, the Dodgers played good infield defense. Then came the years when 
Guerrero or Madlock did the best they could at third -- "I could . . . farther 
than Madlock could move for a grounder," Lasorda says, profanely but accurately 
-- while Steve Sax was busy endangering the lives of spectators behind the 
first-base dugouts with his throws from second base. In 1987, the Dodgers led 
the National League in errors. 
</P>
<P>
Now, not only are they world champions, but the Dodgers believe they have as 
air-tight an infield as anybody's anywhere. Put Hamilton and Griffin on the 
left side, Willie Randolph and Eddie Murray on the right side, and relax at 
last. Claire, for one, claims this infield could well be the best any Dodger 
club has ever had, with no disrespect to the Cey-Russell-Lopes-Garvey or 
Gilliam-Wills-Neal-Hodges around-the-horns. None whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton is the missing link, the long-missing dependable third baseman. He is 
Gold Glove material, particularly with Mike Schmidt in decline. 
</P>
<P>
"Instincts," Lasorda says. "He's got instincts like a Brooks Robinson out 
there. He's quick from the waist up. This guy makes plays Madlock and Guerrero 
only dreamed about. Without a doubt, without a doubt, he's the best third 
baseman in the National League, and I'll tell that to anybody. I'll shout it to 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton steps into a Vero Beach batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
"This man! This man right here! Gonna be one of the greats!" Lasorda shouts, 
going into his act. "Hambone! Show us what you can do in there, Hambone! This 
man's gonna hit 20 homers for us! Show me that stroke, Hambone! Do me a favor! 
When they bring you to New York to accept the most valuable player award, be 
kind to the old man who taught you everything you know!" 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, who says about a sentence an hour, smiles and strokes liners to left. 
</P>
<P>
Realistically, he should hit about .250, showing occasional power. Fifteen 
homers would be nice. Hamilton has enough power. He hit six last season in 
limited duty, including a ninth-inning job off John Franco of Cincinnati on 
Sept. 11 that gave the Dodgers a 5-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton admits he feels better at the plate, more relaxed, and that he 
benefits from knowing, as he never knew before, that the job is his. What he 
hopes to do is rid himself of any reputation he might have as good-field, 
no-hit. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was younger, I never got any special attention for my fielding," he 
says. "I was known more as a hitter." 
</P>
<P>
For the record, in the minors, Hamilton hit .335 at Lethbridge in 1983, .332 at 
San Antonio in 1985, and .313 and .360 at Albuquerque before two mid-season 
call-ups. The guy's no stiff. But, in the majors he has had a tendency to 
uppercut the ball, and to pull everything to left, even if he has to lunge 
across the outside corner to reach it. The manager has enrolled him in a 
"University of Lasorda" hitting course, and tutors him daily. 
</P>
<P>
"Here! Look here!" Lasorda says, rushing into the cage. 
</P>
<P>
He yanks the bat from Hamilton's hands. 
</P>
<P>
"See this part right here?" Lasorda asks, pointing from the trademark to the 
tip. "This is where you'll make your living! This is where the great hitters 
make a million bucks! You've got to drive the ball, Hambone! Throw your bat 
into the pitch and drive it! Drive it!" 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton drives a couple, then steps out of the cage. 
</P>
<P>
"I already believe I can do the job," he says softly. "What I need to do is 
make everybody else believe it." 
</P>
<P>
We who follow the Dodgers want to believe it, just as we want to believe 
Lasorda will win his bet. We like Hamilton's chances better.

PADRE HAS RISEN FROM STREETS OF PUERTO RICO TO FIND A HOME BEHIND THE PLATE

<P>
Behind the house where Benito Santiago grew up, past the weeds, discarded major 
appliances and the two automobiles in the process of being dismantled, there is 
a tall wooden fence. At the base of the fence is a log. 
</P>
<P>
When he was a boy, Santiago used to stand on that log, place his hands on top 
of the fence, and pull himself up. From there, out across miles of flat dry 
fields, he could gaze across a wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
Out there are hills. Giant, flowing hills of green and purple and gold. Hills 
as wide as you can see and as far as you can dream. 
</P>
<P>
Hills that are so big, Santiago used to look at them and see mountains. He used 
to look at them and see an impenetrable barrier between his poor village and 
the rest of the island, the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent day, Santiago walks through the yard, stands on that log, and looks 
over that fence again. Only now it is more like he is staring. His eyes scan 
slowly from left to right, and then stop. For the longest time, he is silent. 
If you didn't know any better, you'd think he is looking at those hills for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, man," he finally says, sucking in his breath. "Those are pretty 
nice, aren't they?" 
</P>
<P>
After a few more moments of silence, Santiago notices a couple of white spots 
on the hills' soft slopes and frowns. The spell is broken. 
</P>
<P>
"Look out there, you can build a house out there now," he says. "Not me. If I 
live in Puerto Rico, I buy a house right on this block, with my people." 
</P>
<P>
The mountains behind him, one of baseball's best catchers can now enjoy the 
view. 
</P>
<P>
But at age 23, there are ghosts hidden in these haunts, and sometimes they rise 
up to spoil his happy picture. 
</P>
<P>
During the course of a recent Monday afternoon in his rural Caribbean town, 
Santiago talked about his quick ascent from a drab and reckless past to one of 
baseball's brightest futures . . . and the difficulties in moving his grip from 
one to the other. He said the most difficult part of being Benito the San Diego 
Padre was that he could no longer be Benito from Jauca. 
</P>
<P>
He talked about wondering, sometimes, which one was better. Which was really 
Benito? 
</P>
<P>
Handed away by his mother at 3 months old, and landing on the streets as a 
child. Handed over to the Padre organization as a 17 year old after two years 
of high school. 
</P>
<P>
Then handed the world. 
</P>
<P>
And expected to hold it. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody understand how tough it is for me," said Santiago, the National League 
rookie of the year in 1987 and postseason Associated Press All-Star catcher the 
past two seasons. "They think it's all being a star. They don't see here. They 
don't see where I live, where I come from, what I got to do. 
</P>
<P>
"One day, I write a book. Nobody believe that book, but I write it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Partially because of the advice of the Padres, Santiago recently purchased a 
house south of San Diego in Bonita, the Spanish word for beautiful. He is 
moving there any day now. He may be leaving Jauca and Puerto Rico for good. 
</P>
<P>
He talks with pride about the good deal he received on the purchase. He talks 
about the quality of the investment. He wonders about the average rate of real 
estate appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he does not once talk about actually living in the house. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife, she really wants to go," he says, pointing to Bianca, who is holding 
daughter Bennybeth, age 3. "My wife, she thinks if I stay here any longer, I go 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
After five minutes with Santiago, it is easy to see why. Of all the Padre stars 
living in Puerto Rico, his environment is the most culturally distant from San 
Diego. The other Padres on the island, with their English-speaking friends and 
educations, can be said to live simply in a different area. Santiago lives in a 
completely different world. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the $165,000 he made last year, he and his family still lived this 
winter with his aunt and uncle and sister -- six people in all -- in a tiny 
house on an unkempt street. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Santiago, none speaks much English. Santiago can, and has, gone an 
entire winter without once practicing the language he must use during the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
And people wonder why he wasn't so witty and engaging during his 34-game 
hitting streak two years ago. They wonder why he struggled to explain his 
struggles last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Come see where I'm from and you understand me better," Santiago says. 
</P>
<P>
On this day, he is so delighted to see a visitor from San Diego, so happy for a 
chance to speak English, that for the better part of three hours he cannot stop 
talking. The conversation begins with Santiago jumping behind the wheel of the 
visitor's car and offering to give a tour. He drives past a couple of houses 
with goats in the back yard and onto a main road lined with endless fields 
dotted by shacks. 
</P>
<P>
"See those guys out there picking tomatoes and watermelons?" he asks, pointing 
to three figures wearing what look to be sack clothes and wide-brimmed straw 
hats. "That used to be me. That would be me today." 
</P>
<P>
He passes a two-pump gas station with dogs chasing each other around the cars: 
"That was my station, I worked there, too. When you don't live with real 
parents, you feel funny about asking for money." 
</P>
<P>
Santiago's real father drove a cement truck. One day his father fell from that 
truck and his rib cage was crushed. The injury was never properly treated, and 
when Benito was 3 months old, his father died. With six girls already under his 
mother's care, she had no time for him. She put him in a car and drove him 20 
minutes from their home in Ponce to Jauca, where she gave him to his aunt and 
uncle. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until he was 7 that he realized what had happened. And he did not 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't my real parents, so I didn't know what to ask of them," he said. 
"I had to do things on my own. I had to find out about things from the 
streets." 
</P>
<P>
His home life appears settled today, as he refers to aunt and uncle as "Mother 
and Father" and showers them with gifts. His aunt even flies to San Diego to 
spend part of the summer with him. 
</P>
<P>
But his is a family problem so complicated, it can never be settled, only 
rearranged. Lately his real mother has been calling him from Ponce, confusing 
him so that he's not even sure how to answer the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I call her 'Mother' when my aunt is sitting right there?" he asks. "Do I 
call her 'Mother' when really, she is no 'Mother?' I finally decide, I call her 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
If it were only so easy with his natural sisters. Four of them live in New York 
City and have taken to calling him when the Padres are in town to play the 
Mets. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows what I go through in New York," Santiago said. "Do I go out with 
these people I don't really know because they are my real sisters? What do I 
tell them? 
</P>
<P>
"I decide, I go see them, but I don't stay long. I don't do too much with them. 
I want to tell them, 'You are not family.' That's what I want." 
</P>
<P>
He sighs. "I remember people who kick me and ignore me when I'm down. Now that 
I'm up, I remember who don't give a damn about me. I'm polite, but I remember." 
</P>
<P>
He steers the car about 10 minutes from Jauca into Santa Isabel, a small 
collection of cluttered shops and a park and a peeling-walled high school whose 
inner courtyard is littered with weeds and trash. It is here that people first 
gave a damn about Santiago. These streets. 
</P>
<P>
It is here Santiago began drinking at age 14. And smoking. And causing so much 
trouble that when his aunt reponded to a question about Benito's childhood by 
answering, "He never gave me any problems," Benito's wife, Bianca, burst out 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
"I cause everybody trouble," Santiago said. "I learn about life through 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Today there is still trouble here. His early pals still live here, the ones who 
aren't jailed or dead. And after all those years of caring about him, now they 
want a pay back. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got old friends here, you come back, and they say, 'You a big man, give 
us this, give us that,' " Santiago said. "Then they say, 'Try this, try that.' 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them, no way I try nothing. Then they say, 'Man, that is bull. You are 
bull.' It is very hard for me." 
</P>
<P>
Other Padres on the island worry that Santiago is being too nice to these 
friends. They say he is difficult to reach during the winter because he is 
constantly out of the house, perhaps hanging out with his friends. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago had promised Carmelo Martinez he would spend a week working out at his 
house on the north side of the island. Martinez is still waiting. 
</P>
<P>
The Alomar family lives 10 minutes from Jauca. Yet Roberto Alomar, when 
learning that a visitor was seeking Santiago, said, "Good luck. You find him, 
you get an award." 
</P>
<P>
Santiago said that yes, he probably hangs around his old friends too much. But 
he said that, whereas it has taken time, he's finally realizing these old 
friends aren't always real friends. Especially, he said, if the talk turns to 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't give up your whole career, everything you've earned, for one stupid 
drug," Santiago said. "I know this, I've always known this. I'm trying to tell 
other people this. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one thing good about moving to San Diego. I get away from some people." 
</P>
<P>
There is a certain sweetness about Santiago that would flourish under different 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Take his daughter, Bennybeth, so named because he wanted a boy. Last summer she 
would constantly beg her mother to rent the animated movie "Lady and the 
Tramp." She loved the golden cocker spaniel named "Lady." 
</P>
<P>
This winter, tied up alongside the Jauca house, is a golden cocker spaniel 
named "Lady." 
</P>
<P>
"My little girl cry for it," Santiago said. "I don't want to see anybody cry." 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is also a certain sharp edge about Santiago that will likely remain 
no matter where he moves. 
</P>
<P>
Take his relationship with Sandy Alomar Jr., the top Padre catching prospect. 
While the two are most cordial, there are feelings Santiago cannot hide. 
</P>
<P>
"Sandy Jr. is a good ballplayer, but look at him, look at his family," Santiago 
said. "He's had it so much easier than me. He didn't lose father, he not lose 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
The tour now takes Santiago to his old baseball field, an overgrown grassy area 
with a wonderful view of those hills. While strolling around the bases with the 
wide eyes of silent kids staring at him, Santiago talks about last season and 
his baseball future. 
</P>
<P>
He began the season in a contract squabble that, he admits for the first time, 
forced him to hold out. It was only for a few hours one morning during spring 
training, until then-General Manager Jack McKeon talked him into returning. The 
year went downhill from there, with Santiago struggling at the plate and 
complaining about occasional benchings for rest and then finally ending the 
year in a silent fight with McKeon that kept Santiago benched for the final 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press still named him baseball's outstanding catcher, despite a 
.248 average with 10 home runs and 46 RBIs. This was because he threw out 45% 
of potential base-stealers, including 65% while on his knees, with an 
incredible eight pickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But this year he says things will be even better, and much different. Now he 
has a new agent and a new agenda. 
</P>
<P>
About dealing with McKeon, he said: "I was wrong to think only of myself. I 
think Jack may have been a little wrong too, but I was more wrong, and I must 
think of team more now. I will think of team. I will think of my future." 
</P>
<P>
Santiago finally finishes the tour. He pulls the car in front of his house, 
gets out and prepares to pose for a picture. 
</P>
<P>
In one part of the front yard is an entire automobile engine laid out on a 
cloth. In another part, a dying tree. 
</P>
<P>
"Is there anywhere I can stand so it doesn't look so terrible?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
He looks around for a minute. And then, as if suddenly realizing that 
understanding and accepting his past gives him a great jump in outracing it, he 
reaches a conclusion. He decides, wherever he stands, it's not so terrible. 
</P>
<P>
"Go on," he said to the photographer, throwing up his arms, laughing like a man 
running down the side of a mountain. "Shoot me anywhere."

Marc Girardelli became the first person to win all four skiing disciplines in 
the same season when he won the final World Cup men's super-giant slalom at 
Whistler, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Girardelli, who was born in Austria and skis for Luxembourg, swept down the 
39-gate Whistler Mountain course in British Columbia in 1 minute 39.84 seconds. 
Lars-Boerje Eriksson of Sweden was second and Pirmin Zurbriggen of Switzerland 
was third. 
</P>
<P>
Girardelli, who has clinched the World Cup overall title with four technical 
events remaining in Japan, earlier won three downhills, two giant slaloms and a 
slalom. 
</P>
<P>
The super-giant slalom was added to the World Cup circuit in 1982.

TURNING THE TABLES, KNICKS TURN BACK CELTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There are a number of reasons why the National Basketball Assn. is enjoying a 
boom period. For one thing, pro basketball is fast-paced. For another, almost 
every team has at least one player worth the price of admission. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe most important, it is an easy sport in which to turn a team around. With 
only five players, an addition here, or a subtraction there, can change the 
direction of a club in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
A prime example of turning it around was easily visible in Sunday's game 
between the Boston Celtics and the Knicks in New York. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the Knicks trailed the Celtics by 16 games in the Atlantic 
Division. After Mark Jackson and Patrick Ewing led the Knicks to a 122-110 
victory, a club record 21st in a row at home, the Knicks lead the Celtics by 11 
1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
For the Celtics, the dominant force in the East since Larry Bird joined them in 
1979, it has been mostly subtraction. True, they showed signs of wear and tear 
in the playoffs, but it was not until Bird, their superstar, went out shortly 
after the start of this season that the Celtics turned from good to mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks' fortunes soared with the maturity of Jackson, Ewing and other 
youngsters and the acquisition of power forward and tough rebounder Charles 
Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics are hoping that Bird, who had surgery to repair both Achilles 
tendons, will return this week. Even with Bird, it is not likely the Celtics 
can handle the new-look Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Pitino, a successful college coach in the East, took over the Knicks 
before last season after the Knicks were 24-58 in 1986-87. He inherited Ewing, 
a 7-foot center who was mostly a disappointment in his two pro seasons, and 
built a team. They improved to 38-44 last season and have the fourth best 
record in the league and are talking championship. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing has become the best offensive center in the league. Jackson, playmaker 
and key man on the pressing defense, is becoming a star. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing had 26 points, 13 rebounds and blocked seven shots as the Knicks went to 
the front early and maintained a good lead most of the way. When the Celtics 
threatened, Jackson scored 10 points in the last quarter to make victory safe. 
He finished with 28 points and 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Their newest player, Kiki Vandeweghe, watched in street clothes. Pitino said he 
will bring the sharpshooter from UCLA along slowly in hopes he will be a factor 
in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics, starting already to revamp their team, played newcomers Joe Kleine 
and Ed Pinckney for the first time. Both came from Sacramento in the Danny 
Ainge deal. 
</P>
<P>
Kleine, a backup center, played 12 minutes and had nine points. Pinckney, a 
forward, played 21 minutes and had 11 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was only 10 for 25 from the field, Reggie Lewis led the Celtics 
(25-29) with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 128, Utah 89 -- It's no wonder Frank Layden gave up coaching the Jazz. 
They are an enigma. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday at Salt Lake City they humiliated the Lakers, beating them by 26 
points. In the first two games of a six-game trip they have lost by a total of 
58 points. 
</P>
<P>
A 19-point loss at Denver is bad enough, but 39 at Indianapolis against one of 
the weakest non-expansion teams in the league? 
</P>
<P>
Rik Smits and Chuck Person each had 10 points in a 42-point third quarter to 
lead the Pacers to their straight second win after 12 consecutive defeats. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone, No. 2 scorer in the league with an average just under 30 points, 
failed to lead Utah. He was four for 11 and had only 14 points and two 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 122, Philadelphia 115 -- Bill Hanzlik, one of the best defensive players 
in the NBA, is finally recovered from a back injury that has sidelined him most 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally the Nuggets wanted him to defend the brilliant Charles Barkley. The 
Nuggets won their ninth home game in a row. Hanzlik didn't just check Barkley, 
he outscored him, 22-20. 
</P>
<P>
The loss gave the 76ers a 2-2 record on a trip that reached the halfway point. 
</P>
<P>
Fat Lever had a triple-double -- 16 points, 12 rebounds and 16 assists -- and 
Alex English had 31 points for Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 124, Miami 102 -- Clyde Drexler had his second consecutive 
triple-double and the Trail Blazers presented new coach Rick Adelman his first 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Drexler had 26 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. Friday in a loss at 
Cleveland he had 18 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds. DAN HAFNER

NHL ROUNDUP;

<P>
FLAMES WAVERING, LOSE TO JETS, 1-0 
</P>

<P>
The Calgary Flames, featuring size, strength and speed, plus the sharpshooting 
of Joe Nieuwendyk, have been the class of the National Hockey League this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
With Wayne Gretzky playing for the Kings, rather than leading the champion 
Edmonton Oilers, the Flames believe this is the year they will win the Stanley 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
But lately, Nieuwendyk has stopped scoring and the Flames are not looking 
all-powerful. They have lost two of their last three games and barely won the 
other, 4-3, at home against the weak St. Louis Blues, who are in a slump. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames' slump became a bit alarming Sunday when rookie goaltender Bob 
Essensa, playing in just his sixth NHL game, shut them out, 1-0, at Winnipeg. 
Dale Hawerchuk scored his 33rd goal on a rebound he flipped over prone goalie 
Rick Wamsley early in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Although Flame Coach Terry Crisp showed no concern, it was another loss to a 
last-place team. Thursday night at Calgary, the Flames lost to Toronto, the 
trailer in the Adams Division, which had won only 20 of 61 games. 
</P>
<P>
Although they haven't given up hope of making the playoffs, the Jets have 
dropped far behind Vancouver in the Smythe Division and won for only the 21st 
time in 62 games. 
</P>
<P>
Essensa is best known as the goaltender who led Michigan State to the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. title in 1986. Last season, his first as a pro, he 
had a 4.66 goals-against average in 27 games for Moncton (Maine) of the 
American Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
After being brought up three weeks ago by the Jets, he is 3-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
"You gotta give the Jets credit," Crisp said. "They shut us down and not many 
teams have done that this year." 
</P>
<P>
The third victory in a row at home gave the Jets a 13-13-4 record on their own 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 5, Vancouver 2 -- The club-record winning streak of the Canucks came 
to a grinding halt at seven in this game at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens, moving to within a point of slumping Calgary in the battle for 
the best overall record, scored three goals before the middle of the first 
period and the Canucks couldn't catch up. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Trevor Linden scored both Vancouver goals, one when the Canucks were 
short-handed and the other on a power play, but Bobby Smith scored twice in the 
last period to open up a safe lead again. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal goaltender Patrick Roy improved his sensational record at the Forum 
this season to 20-0-2. On the road he has posted a mediocre 7-5-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 8, Pittsburgh 6 -- Mario Lemieux scored his 65th goal and added three 
assists at Hartford, but the Penguins missed another chance to regain first 
place in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Whalers built a 6-1 lead before the game was 22 minutes old and held on for 
the victory. The Whalers had 54 shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux needs 50 points in 17 games to tie Wayne Gretzky's scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Detroit 4 -- The Blackhawks, desperately trying to cut into the Red 
Wings' lead in the Norris Division, did everything well at Chicago, but didn't 
get the needed victory. 
</P>
<P>
They outshot the Red Wings, 53-27, including a 6-1 advantage in the five-minute 
overtime, but remained 13 points behind with only 16 games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Denis Savard, returning after missing 13 games with an ankle injury, gave the 
Blackhawks the tie when he scored with 8:14 left in regulation. DAN HAFNER

Bill Laimbeer scored 15 of his 19 points in the first quarter and Mark Aguirre 
had 17 in his first start for Detroit as the Pistons beat the Clippers, 110-98, 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit ran its winning streak to three games while the Clippers lost their 
ninth straight, 28th in 29 games and 18th consecutive game on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Isiah Thomas scored 21 points for Detroit, while Ken Norman had 22 and Gary 
Grant added 20 for the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre, traded by Dallas to Detroit on Feb. 15 for Adrian Dantley and the 
Pistons' 1991 first-round draft pick, topped the 14,000-point plateau with his 
first basket with 4:41 left in the opening period. He has 14,016 points in his 
eight-year career. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons dominated the opening quarter, making 17 of 24 shots and 
outrebounding the Clippers, 18-2. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit jumped to a 17-6 lead midway through the period when Laimbeer hit three 
straight jump shots. Laimbeer made seven of nine shots and Detroit had a 36-19 
lead after one period. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, a 23-12 run by the Clippers closed the gap to 48-42, but 
with Thomas scoring six points, Detroit finished the half with a 10-6 run to 
take a 58-48 lead at halftime.

<P>
Waad Hirmez scored two goals against his former teammates Sunday night as the 
San Diego Sockers won for the fourth time in five games, beating the Los 
Angeles Lazers, 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
Hirmez has six goals in three games since he was reacquired Tuesday in a trade 
with the Lazers. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers have scored 40 goals in winning four of their last five games, 
their only defeat a 10-9 double-overtime loss to the Lazers. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego goalie Victor Nogueira and Felipe Hernandez, who entered in relief 
for the last 6:50, combined to blank Los Angeles for the final 52 minutes. 
Nogueira made 13 saves and Hernandez one. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Ralf Wilhelms scored 5:06 into the game and the Lazers tied it when 
Hector Marinaro scored his MISL-leading 34th goal at 8:00 of the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Hirmez broke the deadlock with 14 seconds left in the first quarter when he put 
a penalty kick past Lazers goalie Kris Peat. Hirmez was awarded the kick after 
defender Fernando Clavijo was called for holding Paul Wright, who was attacking 
in the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers got second-period goals from Alan Willey and Hirmez for a 4-1 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Gorsek replaced Peat at the start of the third quarter and stopped the 
first shot he faced, but then gave up goals to Wright and Steve Zungul as the 
Sockers took a 6-1 lead in the first 3:27 of the period.

ELLIOTT'S MISSILE BRINGS DOWN DUKE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
February has yet to run its course, but this game made you think of March. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Elliott scored 24 points, including a three-point basket with 54 seconds 
left to power second-ranked Arizona to a 77-75 victory over ninth-ranked Duke 
at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the kind of game you usually have to play to advance to the Final 
Four," Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it means that the Wildcats (22-3) will become the top team in the 
Associated Press poll today since No. 1 Oklahoma was beaten by Missouri 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
After Elliott's three-pointer, Duke (21-5) missed two three-point shots before 
Anthony Cook gave Arizona a 75-70 lead with a layup. Quin Snyder hit a 
three-pointer to make it 75-73 with 19 seconds left, but Elliott sank two free 
throws one second later. Snyder's layup with 7 seconds left made it 77-75. 
</P>
<P>
After Cook missed a free throw with six seconds left, Duke's Christian Laettner 
was fouled with one second left. He also missed and Elliott grabbed the 
rebound. 
</P>
<P>
Duke rallied from a 30-11 deficit eight minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Temple 74, West Virginia 56 -- Freshman Mik Kilgore made seven three-pointers 
and scored 33 points as the Owls bumped off the No. 11 Mountaineers in an 
Atlantic 10 Conference game at Philadelphia, ending the nation's longest 
winning streak at 22 games. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first defeat for West Virginia (23-3, 16-1) since a 70-68 setback to 
Bradley on Dec. 3. Herbie Brooks scored 24 points for the Mountaineers. 
</P>
<P>
Temple (16-10, 14-3), which has won 25 consecutive home games, rolled to a 23-6 
lead as Kilgore scored 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia 76, North Carolina State 75 -- Bryant Stith scored 29 points, 
including two free throws with 90 seconds left, and the Cavaliers held on to 
upset the No. 17 Wolfpack in an Atlantic Coast Conference game at Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat prevented N.C. State (18-7, 8-4) from moving into a first-place tie 
with North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Chucky Brown scored 23 points, including a basket with 1:48 left to give the 
Wolfpack a 75-74 lead. After Stith's free throws, N.C. State missed its last 
four shots. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois 94, Ohio State 71 -- Nick Anderson scored 35 points and the 
10th-ranked Illini made 22 of 30 shots in the second half to rout the Buckeyes 
in a Big Ten Conference game at Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State (17-10, 6-8) started the second half with a 7-2 surge for a 44-39 
lead before Illinois (23-4, 10-4) took over with an 18-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa 84, Purdue 67 -- Roy Marble scored 22 points and B.J. Armstrong added 15 
while becoming the No. 14 Hawkeyes' all-time assist leader in a Big Ten victory 
over the Boilermakers at Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Bullard and Armstrong hit consecutive three-pointers early in the second 
half to put Iowa (21-6, 9-5) in command, 45-35. Armstrong had seven assists to 
give him 486, breaking Ronnie Lester's school record of 480. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Scheffler scored 16 points for Purdue (12-16, 5-10). 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse 89, Kentucky 73 -- Junior forward Stephen Thompson scored 13 of his 27 
points in a second half surge that carried the sixth-ranked Orangemen past the 
Wildcats at Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky (12-17) had a 10-point lead in the first half and was within 73-69 
when Syracuse (23-5) closed out the game with 15-4 run. 
</P>
<P>
Cal 78, Oregon 74 -- Leonard Taylor scored 26 points and the Bears downed the 
Beavers in a Pacific 10 Conference game at Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ranniger of Oregon (8-18, 3-13) hit a three-point shot with 13 seconds 
left to cut lead to 75-74, but Ryan Drew hit two free throws for Cal (18-10, 
9-7) with 10 seconds left and Bill Elleby added another.

Slew City Slew led every step of the way to win the $300,000 Gulfstream Park 
Handicap Sunday, beating Bold Midway by 1 1/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Cryptoclearance, the odds-on favorite, came from last but never threatened as 
he finished third, 1 1/2 lengths behind Bold Midway. Intensive Command was 
fourth in the field of six going 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Ridden by Angel Cordero Jr., Slew City Slew was timed in 2:03 1/5. He was 
coupled in the betting with Dynaformer and the entry paid $5.20, $3.40 and 
$2.10. Bold Midway paid $6.20 and $2.10. Cryptoclearance returned $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
Slew City Slew opened a two-length lead and increased it to three lengths while 
turning for home. Slew City Slew led by four lengths at the eighth pole and 
held off Bold Midway's charge.

'WHAT'S ALAN WATCHING?'EDDIE MURPHY'S SHOT IN THE ARM FOR AILING CBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eddie Murphy is a heck of a kidder, and we know you're going to think we're 
kidding when we tell you this, but it's true: The acerbic black comedian's 
return to television is a comedy special about a white teen-age boy in a very 
Caucasian family. Really. 
</P>
<P>
That's just one of the surprises in store for anyone 
</P>
<P>
who tunes in to the terrific "What's Alan Watching?" (8-9 tonight on Channels 2 
and 8). 
</P>
<P>
Murphy served as executive producer, and he also appears in a couple of wild 
character roles -- most notably impersonating singer James Brown -- but this is 
like nothing he's ever been associated with before. The real point of reference 
here is "James at 15," that 1977 movie (and subsequent short-lived series on 
NBC) that depicted a teen-age boy's travails with love, life and family. 
</P>
<P>
"What's Alan Watching?" is what you might get if "James at 15" had been zapped 
into 1989. Zap is the word, because, in a flip on James' daydreams, Alan's 
fantasies are centered around his television. He's constantly zapping it with 
his remote control, and sometimes whoever he's watching -- a woman taking a 
shower in one of those teasing soap ads, the Smothers Brothers, a cheerleader 
he has taped at school -- talks to him. 
</P>
<P>
But while "James at 15" was primarily dramatic, "What's Alan Watching" is 
almost totally comic -- and almost totally successful at it too. 
</P>
<P>
Like Alan Hoffstetter himself (played with verve by heartthrob Corin (Corky) 
Nemec), the hour is funny, irreverent and lively to the point of antsiness. 
Director Thomas Schlamme and writers Barry W. Blaustein, David Sheffield and 
Bob Tischler (the latter also produced) pull every trick in the book to get a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes that results in low comedy (Dad bumping his head while fixing the 
toilet) and caricature (Alan's whiny sister with an inexplicable New York 
accent; her Carpet King boyfriend who's always eating off the rug in his TV 
ads). 
</P>
<P>
More often, it results in super-hip humor -- much of it reflecting sharp truths 
about teen-agers, television and modern American life. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of the funny stuff comes from Alan, who frequently talks to the camera 
(just as his TV characters often talk to him) and from his wacky family, 
rounded out by a tap-dance-and-song instructing Mom ("She's turning my little 
brother into Al Jolstein, dude," complains Alan's punkish rival in love). 
</P>
<P>
And a lot of it comes from that crazy-quilt television: Our boy seldom stays 
with anything longer than a microsecond. The natural juxtapositions are funny 
enough, but when he actually sticks with something for a few seconds, it's 
often a scream -- like a biography of Mr. Ed, those terrific skits that Murphy 
stars in, and a "Jeopardy!" takeoff in which Alex Trebek introduces the 
category "Alan's Family." 
</P>
<P>
There are also numerous little comic quickies that you may miss if you blink. 
When Alan flips to a scene from "Best Defense," one of Murphy's few cinematic 
mistakes, he remarks "bad movie" and flips on. (You can almost hear Murphy's 
chuckle, self-deprecating this time, in the background.) 
</P>
<P>
"What's Alan Watching?" is a pilot for a possible series that, if scheduled, 
should bring ailing CBS the young blood it desperately needs.

'THREE WAYS HOME' PACKS MORAL PUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somehow the idea of a play about a computer animator who inadvertently joins a 
volunteer program to help abusive welfare mothers, befriending and assisting 
one of them, sounds unprepossessing, not to say careless. Inadvertently? So, as 
one person commented aloud in the lobby of the Los Angeles Theatre Center where 
just such a play -- Casey Kurtti's "Three Ways Home" -- opened over the 
weekend: What a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Kurtti's play is no soft little exercise in white middle class liberal 
compassion. This is one tough-talking slab of writing whose jangled emotional 
keyboard is perfectly tuned. It makes an unsparing, frequently comic kind of 
music that lifts a potentially lachrymose, bleeding-heart situation out of the 
humdrum and wouldn't be caught dead imitating, condescending or patronizing 
anything or anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Properly speaking, this is not the story of a reluctant friendship between 
Sharon (Deirdre O'Connell), the childless white volunteer, and Dawn (Vonetta 
McGee), the black welfare mother of four with a sometime live-in, sometime 
violent boyfriend. It is the story of their enthusiastic aggressions: 
determined collisions, campaign strategies and open warfare that end up in 
family court where the volunteer, to her surprise, finds herself joining the 
enemy. 
</P>
<P>
That scene is what you call pivotal, marking a predictable turning point in the 
embattled relationship. But in Kurtti's clever writing and the razor-sharp 
production this play receives at the hands of O'Connell, McGee and the 
acrobatic Glenn Plummer (who plays Dawn's 16-year-old son, Frankie, a kid 
strung out between his X-Men comic book power dreams and his powerlessness as a 
hustler trying to deal with the real world), the moment is triumphant. 
</P>
<P>
Kurtti's play, whose major sin is going on a bit too long, brooks no 
sentimentality. It suggests that the roughest and most improbable encounters 
can bear improbable fruit if a willful, stubborn intelligence prevails on both 
sides. But that's all the concessions it makes. The troubled Frankie is the 
linchpin of the women's relationship, and director Chris Silva has smartly made 
the character more emblematic than real -- a ubiquitous, furtive presence who 
haunts the play as he must haunt his mother's waking moments and our collective 
conscience, while at the same time remaining one of Peter Pan's classically 
Lost Boys. 
</P>
<P>
Quite a trick. But then Silva's staging altogether is quite a trick. The 
production is draped against a series of dark fire-escapes (designed by Donald 
Eastman and lit by Anne Militello, both of whom designed the same show for 
Silva in New York last summer) that serve as a giant Jungle Jim for the 
dream-obsessed Frankie. Plummer is a wiz at filling Frankie's shoes, 
streetwise, aching, curiously innocent and bouncing around the stage with the 
resilience of a rubber ball. 
</P>
<P>
But this is not to take anything away from the women who, between them, carry 
the play. Dawn, with the giant chip on her shoulder, is a predictable customer, 
outwardly stubborn and tough, but devoted to and protective of her kids. 
Kurtti, however, ups the ante by giving her colorful and sometimes unexpected 
responses -- which the attractive, forceful McGee carries off with style and 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
More intriguing is the paradoxical character of Sharon, a woman motivated 
enough to maintain a career, yet who allows herself to be sucked into this 
roller-coaster volunteerism largely in spite of herself. Much of what makes the 
play uncommon is Sharon's reluctant embrace of her new role. And O'Connell 
plays her with such an edge of self-mockery, her own amusement at her 
involuntary new role, that it undercuts any potential pretentiousness that this 
perilous theme invites. It's another benchmark for this amazing actress ("Etta 
Jenks," "Stars in the Morning Sky"). 
</P>
<P>
There is a fourth and important character in this play who never appears on 
stage. It is the disembodied presence of Janet, the caseworker who ropes Sharon 
into volunteering and Dawn into accepting the volunteer. Through this 
programmed quasi-mythical creature, Kurtti strikes some of her more serious 
satirical blows, undercutting the standard psychobabble and bankrupt phrases 
designed to fix unbearable lives with Happy Face Band-Aids. 
</P>
<P>
That subtext alone would be worth the price of admission. But there is a lot 
more going on in "Three Ways Home" than meets the ear. And if Kurtti would only 
take a hard look at the play's second half and slash a good 10 minutes, few 
experiences would touch this one for unmoralistic lessons in deep morality. 
</P>
<P>
 At 514 S. Spring St., Tuesdays through Sundays, 8 p.m. with Saturday and 
Sunday matinees at 2, until April 30. Tickets: $22-$25; (213) 627-5599.

DANCE REVIEW;

'UNITED STATES' BIRTH AT UCLA'S ROYCE HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, Times Dance Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Gordon appeared in Los Angeles 13 years ago with a performance collective 
called Grand Union that got at major perceptual issues through a dazzling array 
of disciplines and perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
His subsequent career in dance (including the 1987 "Made in the U.S.A." 
telecast with Mikhail Baryshnikov on PBS) has continued to use the information 
overload of our society as a blueprint for pieces that reveal their meanings 
through dynamic juxtapositions of different movement forms, accompaniments and 
contexts. 
</P>
<P>
In his fascinating, new (indeed, still evolving) "'United States" -- at Royce 
Hall, UCLA, on Friday -- Gordon brilliantly balances his layerings of text, 
music, image and motion to suggest the ways that history, environment and 
personal experience define an American region's perception of itself. 
</P>
<P>
Danced by Gordon's fine 12-member Pick Up Co., each section of the full-evening 
work starts with a spoken artistic credo that focuses its choices. Robert 
Frost's statement about the importance of meter or rhythm in poetry ("keeping 
the swing up") embodies the traditional sense of values examined in "Mozart, 
Memories and the First Frost," a k a "Minnesota." The idea of art as a witness 
to suffering shapes "Pounding the Beat and Slaughter," a k a "New York." 
Finally, art as a process of constant revision unifies "Words, Music, Wildlife 
and Weather," a k a "The West" (though Iowa is included). 
</P>
<P>
For ideal rhythm, Gordon turns to Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 17 in G, a score 
that helps give his "Minnesota" dances distinctively classical emphasis on 
symmetry and steadiness. The costumes refer to a genteel past and the text too 
is often nostalgic: intense events transmuted by time. Sometimes the movement 
specifically reflects the words (centrifugal patterns during talk about the 
wheel-of-life, for instance), but more often Gordon's choreography reinforces 
verbal themes through a parallel concentration on matters of form and 
proportion. 
</P>
<P>
If the source idiom for "Minnesota" is ballet, "New York" develops from show 
dancing and the "Western" section from folk dance. Gordon sees New York as torn 
between blue-collar fascism and designer anarchy, with Richard Rodgers' 
"Slaughter on Tenth Avenue" again expressing both the nervous energy and 
glamour of the place. Random violence dominates this neodramatic section, with 
Gordon and his wife, Valda Setterfield, representing the classic, victimized 
soul of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of revision guides the "Western" section partly through structural 
gambits: Gordon and Setterfield dancing one duet twice, for example -- the 
second time with umbrellas -- or Gordon seizing the opportunity to 
re-choreograph that recurrent obsession of his career, a dance incorporating a 
metal folding chair. But the landscape's own propensity for revision looms 
large in texts about disastrous dust storms and floods, as well as documentary 
accounts of changes wrought by industrialization. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the work is equally successful and the "New York" section is 
especially problematic when it swerves into literal, dead-end dance-drama 
(Setterfield in widow's weeds) or timidly treads on the very familiar turf 
conquered by George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, Talley Beatty and others. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, with this "United States," there's no pressure to love it or leave 
it. Gordon is on to something fundamental about evolving consciousness and 
there's every hope that as his research continues, his own consciousness will 
deepen and his work evolve beyond formula insights into something so proudly we 
hail.

A living room set and artwork that graced Ludwig von Beethoven's salon goes on 
the auction block in Paris next week. Dorotheum of Vienna and French auctioneer 
Jacques Tajan are collaborating on a next-Monday-through-March-7 sale of 19th- 
and 20th-Century Austrian art objects, including paintings, drawings and 
etchings by masters Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele and Oskar Kokoschka. The 
furniture set, which is estimated to sell for at least $10,000, was owned by 
Beethoven until his death in 1827 and was part of his estate. Shauna Snow

Linda Gray, who recently announced that she is leaving the cast of "Dallas," 
says that she doesn't want her character, Sue Ellen, to be maimed in a car 
crash (the way Victoria Principal was written out of the story) or die and then 
step out of the shower a year later to say it was all a dream (the way Patrick 
Duffy was revived as Bobby Ewing). Instead, Gray, who plans a feature-film 
career and hopes to star in a situation comedy someday, has asked the producers 
to keep Sue Ellen alive, hoping that she can continue to make trouble for the 
Ewings next season in occasional guest appearances. "I said that I would like 
to leave with dignity -- no showers, no auto accidents, no 
disease-of-the-month," Gray said. "I really wanted not to die." Shauna Snow

LAMB'S HITS THE BIG LEAGUES WITH 'AMADEUS' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The good news is that a decade after Peter Shaffer wrote "Amadeus," the play -- 
now in a luscious, shimmering production at Lamb's Players Theatre -- still 
works. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, "Amadeus" poses the eternal question of why genius would be 
bestowed on as rude, crude and seemingly unworthy person as the young Wolfgang 
Amadeus (or "Beloved of God") Mozart, while mediocrity should be the lot of 
Viennese court composer Antonio Salieri. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the dilemma, of course, is that this is a tale of worthiness versus 
unworthiness in Salieri's eyes alone. And what Salieri doesn't see is that the 
fault lies in his conception of God as a merchant weighing out such good deeds 
as chastity and charity and doling out fame and fortune accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
The danger in producing a play about mediocrity versus genius is that it draws 
attention to the quality of the show itself, begging the question of whether 
the company here has pulled a Mozart or a Salieri. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. There is an auspicious feeling of stretch to Lamb's season 
opener, playing through March 25. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb's has supplemented its capable ranks with worthy talent. It is directed by 
associate artistic director Kerry Cederberg, and only David Cochran Heath 
(Salieri) and Michael Buckley (Venticello, one of Salieri's servants) are 
regulars. The rest of the cast -- headed by Aloysius Mullally as a Mozart who 
exudes innocence and Robert F. Stark as Joseph II, the hopelessly unmusical 
emperor to whom manners are everything -- bring original and colorful 
interpretations to the parts. 
</P>
<P>
One could ask for more, to be sure: More music to be piped in by Mozart and 
Salieri. Also, the range of Salieri's task -- to move through time and space, 
from smug contentment to existentialist despair, from apostle to Judas -- can 
provide the role of an actor's career. If Heath is not the last word on 
Salieri, he delivers a creditable performance with the promise of more over the 
course of the run. 
</P>
<P>
The production gleams with the attention to detail that nudges Lamb's, at last, 
into the bigger leagues. Kudos for the engagement of a movement consultant and 
dramaturge. The elegant costumes by Veronica Murphy Smith -- all lace, brocade 
and tight corsets -- are excellently complemented by the wigs. Brett Kelly's 
lighting plays its own musical variations on the smooth, polished surface of 
Mike Buckley's simple set. 
</P>
<P>
There may be flaws in the diamond, but this is still a gem of a show.

POP CAPSULES : LAIBACH BREAKS REGIMENTAL RANKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
So much of Laibach's advance publicity has painted the Yugoslavian rockers as 
grim, regimented neo-Nazis that it wasn't surprising to find a few misguided 
fans throwing out stiff-armed "Seig Heil" salutes as the band took the stage 
Saturday night at the Scream Club. How stupid. Because for all their theorizing 
and their use of allegedly fascist imagery, Laibach is no more Nazi than, say, 
Queen -- whose anthemic "We Will Rock You" brand of stadium-rock was employed 
by Laibach in its reductionist interpretations of songs from the Beatles' "Let 
It Be" album. 
</P>
<P>
Milan Fras' stiff, commanding stance and Roto-Rooter growl fit the group's 
authoritarian image as he threateningly intoned the Rolling Stones' "Sympathy 
for the Devil" against what sounded like an industrial-rock version of the 
"Anvil Chorus." But one of the two bare-chested snare drummers flanking Fras 
broke regimental ranks, pouring water on himself, swigging beers and acting 
like a clown -- actually having fun. Which might have diminished the sinister 
effect of the loud, pummeling, multimedia presentation but proved that even 
totalitarian visionaries can be as sloppy as decadent capitalists. CRAIG LEE

MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS : ARLEEN AUGER AT USC'S HANCOCK AUDITORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Listening to a song recorded by Arleen Auger, one might be inclined to credit 
the engineers for some of the apparent perfection. That any singer should be 
able to sustain such effortless lines, such pure and exquisitely gauged sound, 
so consistently, seems unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
Believe it. Saturday evening at USC, the American soprano demonstrated anew in 
recital her musical command of a virtually flawless voice. 
</P>
<P>
And that despite singing in the quirky reverberation chamber that is Hancock 
Auditorium. Neither the echoes nor an odd baritone hum intermittently 
afflicting the second half disconcerted her. 
</P>
<P>
Auger's program was an unusual gathering of lieder sets by Berg, Wolf and 
Schoenberg, from the period 1888-1908. She pointed the varied texts with 
sensitive assurance, controlled without any sense of inhibition. She ranged 
easily from the radiance of Schoenberg's "Waldsonne" to the chill, implacable 
simplicity of Wolf's "Auf ein altes Bild," finding at all points vital worlds 
of musical wonder. 
</P>
<P>
In all, she had the deft support of pianist Irwin Gage, who accompanied with a 
paradoxical sort of fastidious exuberance, and made telling statements in the 
many little postludes. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly full house was unreserved in its acclamation, and Auger responded to 
the standing ovations with three Richard Strauss lieder in encore.JOHN HENKEN

POP CAPSULES : THE TASTE OF SUGAR IN '70S SOUL AT CELEBRITY THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A diet of all sweets is no way to eat, and it's not the way to listen to soul 
music either. 
</P>
<P>
Sharing a '70s soul bill Friday at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim, the 
Stylistics, the Dramatics and the Chi-Lites had their moments, but overall the 
program left too much of a confectionary taste. The Stylistics and the 
Chi-Lites were almost exclusively dependent on their falsetto lead singers; 
only the Dramatics offered a rounded, balanced, satisfying sound. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet sorrow was the emotional savor of the Chi-Lites' 45-minute opening set. 
With his plaintive falsetto sounding sturdier than it did on the group's hit 
recordings, lead singer Eugene Record mixed tears with sugar to good, if 
unvaried, effect. 
</P>
<P>
The headlining Stylistics' set rode on the falsetto voice of Russell Thompkins 
Jr. It was a sonic marvel -- soaring, reedy, operatic and inexhaustible. But, 
for all that, it wasn't especially endearing, and with little help from 
Thompkins' two mates, it was far too much of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
The Dramatics' zestful set made one wonder what the Detroit group's place in 
pop history might be had it been blessed with grade-A material. The five 
singers interlocked in classic Temptations style, with the emphasis on two 
compelling lead voices -- Ron Banks' assured, effortless falsetto and L. J. 
Reynolds' bulldog baritone. But while the Temptations, and all the other A-list 
soul vocal groups, have archives full of wonderful songs, the Dramatics' best 
material is merely good. That, in the eyes of pop history, makes all the 
difference. MIKE BOEHM

AS INTIFADA GOES ON, HOPES FOR UNITED JERUSALEM FADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
JERUSALEM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tenuous reputation of Jerusalem as a united city, much less a city of 
peace, has all but evaporated during the 15-month Arab uprising, and in its 
place, two distinct cities are arising, born of fear and rejection and with 
differing views of themselves and their futures. 
</P>
<P>
The split in the city, which politicians habitually call Israel's "united, 
eternal capital," is a daily fact of life for most of its citizens as Arabs and 
Jews try to avoid each other. Invisible lines separate neighborhoods into 
islands where outsiders tread with caution: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Jewish history professor in Jerusalem plans circuitous routes to his 
university in order to avoid Arab neighborhoods along the way. He carries a 
pistol when he travels. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An Arab waiter dubs himself Rafi, a common Hebrew nickname, to gain 
protection from cold stares and abusive language. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Another Arab, a gardener who travels into Jewish neighborhoods by bus, 
hides his traditional checkered headdress in a bag so his ethnic background 
cannot immediately be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Jewish mother takes care always to enter the Old City through Zion Gate 
on her way to prayers at the sacred Western Wall, because along that way there 
is less chance of meeting hostile Arabs -- or so she thought until hearing 
about the fatal stabbing of a young, off-duty soldier there on a recent Sabbath 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"At most, Jerusalem can be said to hold together only as a mosaic. And even 
that is crumbling," said Michael Roman, an Israeli author and researcher on the 
city. "Everybody is conscious of borders. The divisions between the 
neighborhoods are clear-cut." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, when municipal elections are held, these divisions will be 
ratified, experts say. Arab voters, never very enthusiastic participants in the 
election process, are expected to stay at home en masse. Their message: 
Jerusalem is part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and thus is part of the 
intifada, as the uprising is called in Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
"Participation in the elections would imply that we accept unilateral 
annexation," said Hanna Siniora, a Palestine Liberation Organization supporter 
and editor of the Arabic-language Al Fajr newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
As if to press the point further, the election boycott may loosen the grip on 
City Hall of Teddy Kollek, mayor for 24 years and perhaps Israel's leading 
booster of a united Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Kollek, who is personally popular, will be reelected easily, but his One 
Jerusalem Party holds only a two-seat majority on the 31-member city council 
and may lose it without the Arab turnout. Thus, he may be forced to deal with a 
hostile majority less interested in tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Kollek fully succeeds at the polls or not, observers say, the basic 
cleaving of the city will remain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Feel the Tension 
</P>
<P>
"The city is united solely in a physical sense," said longtime resident Ibrahim 
Dakkak, who heads the Arab Thought Forum, a think tank in Arab East Jerusalem. 
"You can feel the tension just traveling from one neighborhood to another. Only 
the sewerage flows freely from place to place, and a city is not just a system 
of sewers." 
</P>
<P>
The open split in the city has revived a question that has haunted Jerusalem 
for centuries, through rule by natives and invaders alike: Whose city is this, 
anyway? 
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli side, the answer once seemed clear. The annexation of Jerusalem 
-- which had been divided between Israel and Jordan -- after Israel's triumph 
in the 1967 Six-Day War was considered a millennial event for Jews, who make up 
three-fourths of the city's 450,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Jewish dominance and the military power to back it up, certainty that 
Jerusalem is all Israel's has been shaken from time to time -- and since the 
intifada began, Jewish residents have suffered almost a continual crisis of 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Israeli insecurity boiled over. On Feb. 18 an off-duty Israeli 
soldier, Shlomo Cohen, was fatally stabbed by Arabs while he was on his way to 
pray at the Western Wall, according to witnesses. Zion Gate, the site of the 
murder, is a prime entry into the ancient stone enclave, a place where Jews 
frequently pass on their way to and from prayer. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen's murder was the talk of Jewish neighborhoods and the subject of hours of 
phone-in radio shows. The tragedy seemed to call into question a fundamental 
Israeli view of the capital, and perhaps of the country as well, that here is a 
place Jews can move without fear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Haven't Really Adjusted' 
</P>
<P>
Days after the stabbing, Nahum Rabinovitch, a local rabbi visiting the scene of 
the crime, commented on the irony of Jewish fear in a city claimed by Jews. 
"Perhaps we haven't really adjusted to thinking of ourselves as owners in our 
own home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The rabbi suggested that the answer is subjugation or expulsion of Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
"We want peace, but whoever isn't comfortable living in a Jewish city must draw 
the appropriate conclusions," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Kollek visited the scene of the stabbing and defiantly announced: "An 
increased Jewish presence in all parts of the city will make clear to the 
assassins our determination in the struggle for a united capital of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
"An event like this stabbing is more important than any election, any peace 
conference," said David Hartman, an Orthodox rabbi and philosopher. "It 
threatens the very reason for Jews coming here: to be able to be Jewish 
publicly, without hiding behind walls, indoors." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reclaiming Property 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, some Jews are making moves to permanently penetrate Arab 
districts. In the Old City, groups of young Orthodox Bible students are 
reclaiming scattered Jewish property in the Muslim Quarter to make the point 
that Jews can live anywhere in the Holy Land. 
</P>
<P>
"Where is it written that we can't live among the Arabs?" asked Ezekiel 
Frankel, a young resident of a yeshiva established within the Muslim Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Frankel dismissed criticism that Jewish moves into Arab neighborhoods make the 
Old City a flash point for tensions. The Jewish repopulation there, he said, is 
a step toward fulfillment of the desire to re-establish the historic temple on 
its original site, the Temple Mount, where a complex of sites holy to Islam now 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
"We see that this is the future. If we have to pay a price of being surrounded 
by unfriendly neighbors, it is worth paying," Frankel said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Concerns 
</P>
<P>
On the Arab side of Jerusalem, the concerns and outlooks are different, 
however. It is rare that Arabs would feel threatened by a hidden knife in a 
Jewish neighborhood; instead, it is harassment -- sometimes overt, sometimes 
subtle -- that discourages them from moving too freely on the Jewish side of 
town. 
</P>
<P>
"When anything untoward happens, it is the Arabs who are rounded up," said 
Albert Aghazarian, an Armenian Christian and longtime resident of the Old City. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such drawbacks, Arabs are compelled to travel to Jewish districts by 
the weight of dependence: either they have business there, or they must go to 
some government office or another to get needed papers and permits. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many Arabs have cut back on visits. "I remember it was kind of a thrill 
to go to the west side at first because there were more movies, more places to 
eat, more bookstores -- and all with an exotic Western flavor," Dakkak 
recalled. "Now, it is no longer a novelty, and people just stay where they are. 
And let's face it: With the intifada, and all the shutdowns and strikes, there 
is less business to do." 
</P>
<P>
Like their Jewish neighbors, Arabs think of Jerusalem as their own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Spiritual Suburbs' 
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem is why we are here. The other cities in the Holy Land are just 
spiritual suburbs of Jerusalem," said Sari Nusseibeh, a Palestinian nationalist 
aligned with the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Nusseibeh pointed out that Arab Christians and Muslims alike view some form of 
possession of Jerusalem as important. "For us, there is a sense of this city as 
a place where man can reach out to heaven," said Nusseibeh, who is Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
Arabs like Nusseibeh are beginning to ponder ways in which at least part of 
Jerusalem might be restored to their domination -- as capital of a Palestinian 
state. In a sense, the de facto division caused by the intifada has led them to 
think that a formal partition can somehow be accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not important so much who rules all of Jerusalem as who rules us," 
Nusseibeh said. "The city can be shared by the two peoples who live here, 
Palestinians and Israelis." 
</P>
<P>
"We already live in two cities," declared Faisal Husseini, who has been 
publicly identified as a top PLO representative in Jerusalem. "All that remains 
is to find a formula that ratifies it." 
</P>
<P>
In their dreams, the Arabs insist they do not want the city mutilated by a 
barbed-wire border running through it, as it was when it was divided between 
Israel and Jordan before 1967. Instead, they see a physically united city 
making room for two capitals of two different nations. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone wants to see a Berlin Wall built through the city," 
Dakkak said. 
</P>
<P>
But Israeli officials and the vast majority of citizens reject such musings out 
of hand. 
</P>
<P>
Even Kollek's legendary tolerance falls far short of letting an Arab flag fly 
over a part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We (Jews) for 3,000 years have believed that this is our capital, and we have 
acted accordingly. We prayed for it three times a day, and we have never given 
up the idea. Jerusalem was never the capital of any Arab state. Not everything 
they (the Palestinians) want can they get," Kollek said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kollek's good works -- from planting flowers to modernizing entrances 
to the Old City -- are considered praiseworthy, critics say that the mayor has 
failed to recognize the basic problem, and hence the futility of his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gloomy Chronicler 
</P>
<P>
"He was the screen that kept all sides from staring into the flame," said Meron 
Benvenisti, a former aide to Kollek and a gloomy chronicler of the city's fate. 
"Kollek tries to reduce Jerusalem to a problem of services, as if giving Arabs 
the chance to collect their own garbage is enough. The problem is, the Arabs 
are not seeking good government, they're seeking self-government." 
</P>
<P>
Kollek denies that his dream is dead; instead, he argues, it is merely facing 
hard times. "Extremism is growing on all sides, and this makes things 
difficult," he said in a recent interview. "I never had the idea that the 
populations here could mix -- but at least we might live in reasonable 
neighborliness."

IRAN ASKS SOVIET HELP TO BATTLE 'DEVILISH' WEST 
</P>

<P>
The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's leader, said Sunday he wants strong 
ties with Moscow to help fight the "devilish" West, and Iranian lawmakers 
reportedly agreed to consider breaking ties with Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini's overtures to the Soviet Union, which he previously condemned for its 
atheist ideology, came during a 1 1/2-hour meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's news agency said it was believed to be the first private meeting between 
Iran's 88-year-old revolutionary patriarch and a foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
In an indication of warming relations, the semiofficial newspaper Tehran Times 
quoted an "unidentified source" as saying that "current discussions are under 
way on significant arms dealing" between Moscow and Tehran. The newspaper added 
that an Iranian military delegation visited Moscow last December as part of a 
"joint economic commission" set up in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Khomeini nor Shevardnadze mentioned arms negotiations in their public 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union had been a major arms supplier to Iraq, Iran's foe in the 
eight-year Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini stressed to Shevardnadze the importance of "the expansion of strong 
ties in various dimensions in confronting the devilish acts of the West," 
Tehran Radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze later met with Prime Minister Hussein Moussavi, and the two agreed 
to set up mechanisms for "regulating political contacts" between Moscow and 
Tehran, Tehran Radio said. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said that Nikolai Konarev, chairman of the Iran-Soviet joint 
economic commission, will visit Iran shortly "with significant proposals," 
Iran's news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope significant changes will take place in bilateral cooperation in the 
political and economic fields as a result of the current atmosphere," he told 
Moussavi. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini used the meeting with Shevardnadze to deliver a short sermon intended 
for Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, according to the Iranian news 
service, the official Islamic Republic News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Khomeini expressed dissatisfaction at 
Gorbachev's treatment of the spiritual aspects of a message he sent him Jan. 4. 
Khomeini called for the Kremlin leader to study Islam and consider it as a 
solution to social problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to open for Mr. Gorbachev a window to a great world -- that is the 
world after death, which is the eternal one. That was the main thrust of my 
message, and I hope he will try again in this respect," the radio quoted 
Khomeini as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze quoted Gorbachev as saying all Soviet leaders have studied 
Khomeini's message, which was "full of many ideas." 
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly we agree with many major points, but there are points with which 
we disagree too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio quoted Shevardnadze as telling Khomeini: "Our conviction is that 
conditions are ripe for relations between our two countries to enter a 
qualitatively new stage of cooperation in all fields." 
</P>
<P>
The ayatollah replied: "Of course we want relations to develop, too." 
</P>
<P>
The radio broadcast 22 minutes of the meeting at Khomeini's home in north 
Tehran in which Shevardnadze, speaking through an interpreter, relayed a 
message from Gorbachev to Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Past 'Gross Errors' 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze quoted Gorbachev as saying Moscow respects freedom of choice for 
nations and, while backing Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, defended the Soviet 
system as the right choice for its own people despite "gross errors" in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's news agency said Shevardnadze did not ask Khomeini to withdraw his order 
for Muslim zealots to assassinate British author Salman Rushdie because of his 
book "The Satanic Verses." Britain reportedly asked Shevardnadze to press 
Khomeini to give a reprieve to Rushdie, whose book has been denounced as 
insulting to Islam. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no mention of the affair in Shevardnadze's speech," IRNA said. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Shevardnadze came two days after Khomeini declared Iran does 
not need relations with the West. This issue has divided the Tehran hierarchy 
between so-called pragmatists, who favor more relations with the rest of the 
world, and hard-liners, who favor continued isolation. 
</P>
<P>
However, Iran's Cabinet declared Sunday that it is united behind Khomeini, 
reported Tehran Television, which also was monitored in Nicosia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Enemies of Islam' 
</P>
<P>
"Your children are united as a single hand against the enemies of Islam," it 
quoted a Cabinet statement as saying of the international furor over Rushdie.

CHINESE BAR DISSIDENT FROM PRESIDENT'S FAREWELL BANQUET

President Bush reaffirmed ties of Sino-U.S. friendship in wide-ranging 
discussions with China's top leaders Sunday, but his visit was marred when 
Chinese security agents blocked the country's most prominent dissident from 
attending a Bush-hosted banquet. 
</P>
<P>
Astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, who was expelled from the Communist Party in early 
1987 for allegedly instigating pro-democracy student demonstrations, was among 
500 guests -- including President Yang Shangkun and Premier Li Peng -- who were 
invited to the Texas-style barbecue banquet at the Great Wall Sheraton Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese police and security agents, however, physically prevented Fang and his 
wife from attending, Fang said early today. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush flew from Beijing to Seoul aboard Air Force One this morning, White 
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that the President "expressed 
his regret" about the Fang "incident" to Vice Premier Wu Xueqian, the ranking 
Chinese official bidding farewell to Bush at the Beijing airport. Fitzwater 
said he did not know Wu's response. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Bush also asked U.S. Ambassador Winston Lord to determine 
the details of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater also disclosed that the President reported he raised the human rights 
issue privately in his meetings in China and that Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III did likewise. 
</P>
<P>
However, he as much as acknowledged that the United States was putting primary 
emphasis on economic reform in China over political reform. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. approach, he said, "was to focus on economic reforms and, to a degree, 
political reforms. But economic reforms first, and that's where the primary 
areas of progress have been made." 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement distributed after Bush reached Seoul, Fitzwater made 
only passing reference to human rights, saying, "We hope for more progress." 
</P>
<P>
The statement said Bush felt the trip was successful and cited the interest in 
both nations on moving ahead on such issues as two-way trade, the developing 
military relationship, and the flow of Chinese students to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush Sees Deng, Zhao 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Bush discussed a host of international and bilateral issues in 
separate meetings with Premier Li, Communist Party General Secretary Zhao 
Ziyang, and China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. 
</P>
<P>
His talks with Deng focused on issues related to the warming trend in 
Sino-Soviet relations, while Zhao outlined the relationship of political and 
economic issues in China's reforms, according to White House officials. 
</P>
<P>
Li and Bush discussed Taiwan, Cambodia, the Philippines, the Korean Peninsula, 
the Middle East, terrorism, Chinese reforms, trade and East-West relations, 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. That meeting touched specifically 
on the issue of Chinese missile sales, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's hourlong meeting with Deng "centered almost entirely on Sino-Soviet 
relations," Fitzwater said at a press briefing. 
</P>
<P>
Previously tense relations between China and the Soviet Union have shown rapid 
improvement over the last year. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is 
scheduled to visit Beijing in mid-May to meet Deng in the first Sino-Soviet 
summit since 1959. 
</P>
<P>
Bush opened his discussion with Deng "by saying that we welcomed the meeting 
between the president of the Soviet Union and Chairman Deng Xiaoping, that we 
saw it as an important and useful step in providing stability to the region as 
well as the world," Fitzwater said. "He wanted to assure the chairman that 
United States policy with regard to China would not be affected by the outcome 
of those discussions -- that the Sino-United States relationship is strong and 
is an evolving one, and that he wished the chairman well in those discussions." 
</P>
<P>
Premier Li repeated previous assurances -- first given last September to 
then-Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci -- that China will show restraint in 
future sales of missiles to other countries. Chinese sales of 
intermediate-range ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia and anti-ship Silkworm 
missiles to Iran have been a key divisive issue in U.S.-China relations. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Fitzwater apparently revealed more than he was supposed to about the 
nature of those assurances. 
</P>
<P>
"The President raised our concerns about missile proliferation," Fitzwater said 
at the briefing. "The premier recalled Deng Xiaoping's statement to former 
Defense Secretary Carlucci that China would not sell missiles to countries 
other than Saudi Arabia. The premier reaffirmed that commitment." 
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, deputy White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk sought to 
retract Fitzwater's statement, describing it as "incorrect." Popadiuk declined, 
however, to give details on what Li said. 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of Taiwan -- which Beijing has viewed as a breakaway province 
ever since China's former Nationalist Party government took refuge there in 
1949 after its defeat by the Communists on the Chinese mainland -- Bush 
reaffirmed that the United States is "committed to a one-China policy," 
Fitzwater said. Bush restated the American position that the future of the 
island should be worked out by the Chinese themselves, both those on Taiwan and 
on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
The evening banquet featured barbecued brisket, sausage and chicken, potato 
salad, cole slaw, baked beans, pecan pie, peach cobbler and vanilla ice cream. 
A U.S. Navy band played country-western music and there were words of 
friendship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Great Potential' 
</P>
<P>
"I have emerged from these talks convinced that U.S.-China relations are 
strong," Bush said in a banquet toast. "There is also great potential for 
further development." 
</P>
<P>
Dissident scientist Fang, however, never reached the banquet hall. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after midnight Sunday, Fang and a friend who had set off with him to 
the banquet, UCLA Prof. Perry Link, director of the U.S. Academy of Sciences 
office in Beijing, appeared at the press room set up in another hotel for 
reporters covering Bush's visit. At an impromptu news conference, Fang related 
in slightly broken English what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
Fang said that he and Link and their wives were riding in a car to the banquet 
when police stopped them not too far from the hotel. Chinese security officers 
told Fang that he and his wife, Beijing University physics professor Li 
Shuxian, could not attend the banquet, Fang said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Even Taxi Was Stopped 
</P>
<P>
The couples then tried to take a taxi to the U.S. Embassy, and the taxi was 
stopped. They walked to the American ambassador's residence but were stopped 
outside by Chinese guards, Fang said. They later went to a Canadian diplomat's 
home, and finally got in touch with American officials only as the banquet was 
ending, Fang and Link said. Link heads an American academic office in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Fang expanded on his thoughts in an interview conducted in Chinese. He said 
that if Bush had intended to make a point about human rights by inviting him to 
the banquet, but wanted at the same time to avoid raising the subject directly 
with Chinese leaders, then this "is not very smart." 
</P>
<P>
General Secretary Zhao sharply told the President on Sunday that advocates of 
"the multi-party politics and parliamentary politics of Western countries" are 
a threat to China's market-oriented reforms and that their American supporters 
are no friends of China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Stirring Up Disorder' 
</P>
<P>
"The role they play in practical life is not to promote reform, but to provide 
a pretext for rolling back reform and stirring up social disorder," Zhao said, 
according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing, who spoke at a Sunday 
evening press conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not export our system to other countries, nor do we copy the systems of 
other countries," Zhao added, according to Li. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that some personages in American society support those people who are 
dissatisfied with the Chinese government will not contribute to the stability 
of China's political situation and the carrying out of China's reforms, nor 
will it be conducive to the friendship between China and the United States," 
Zhao added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Warning From Premier 
</P>
<P>
Premier Li issued a similar warning to Bush. "The Chinese premier . . . pointed 
out that a few Americans are attempting to influence China's policies on this 
issue or that, and interfere in China's internal affairs," the official New 
China News Agency reported.

<P>
President Bush, praising South Korea for "a commitment to democracy (that) is 
demonstrated daily," today pledged unflagging military support for the South 
Korean government but delivered a stern warning to Seoul to not let 
protectionist trade practices sour its relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said in a speech prepared for delivery to the South Korean National 
Assembly that the Korean economy "has benefited greatly from the free flow of 
trade." 
</P>
<P>
"Yet today, in many countries, there is a call for greater protectionism. I am 
asking you to join the United States in rejecting these shortsighted pleas," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Protectionism is fool's gold. Protectionism may seem to be the easy way out, 
but it is really the quickest way down. Nothing will stop the engine of Korea's 
economic growth faster than new barriers to international trade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's visit coincided with growing anti-American sentiment in some sectors of 
South Korean society, which have protested the deployment of U.S. troops in 
this country and Washington's recent attempts to open the protected local 
market to U.S. agricultural products. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of police swarmed the area around the U.S. Embassy in central Seoul 
at noon and crushed an attempt by a tiny band of dissidents to hold a 
demonstration. About a dozen protesters unfurled a banner and chanted "We 
oppose Bush's visit to the death!" for about two minutes before they were 
surrounded by green-helmeted plainclothes police and hauled away. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, at a news conference, leaders of South Korea's largest 
dissident alliance, Chonminyon, or the National People's Democratic Movement 
League, accused Bush of supporting a "military dictatorship" by stopping here 
for a meeting with President Roh Tae Woo, a former army general who succeeded 
an authoritarian ruler, Chun Doo Hwan, by election one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was expected to meet briefly with opposition leaders after his National 
Assembly speech and his luncheon meeting with Roh, staying on the ground for 
only five hours, according to South Korean officials. 
</P>
<P>
After the lunch, Bush said he had a "very frank discussion" with the Korean 
president on trade problems. Roh said that he and Bush share the view that the 
concerted efforts by South Korea and the United States have become increasingly 
important for the progress of the free-market system throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
During a picture-taking session that preceded the luncheon with the South 
Korean president, Bush was told by Roh's interpreter about the demonstrations 
taking place in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
The two presidents and their aides took off their shoes and donned beige 
slippers for the traditional Korean lunch, where the guests sat on a heated 
floor on cushions with hard backs. The lanky Bush, experiencing difficulty in 
stretching his long legs under the table, asked his Korean hosts, "Do you put 
your legs straight out or do you fold them up?" 
</P>
<P>
Roh's answer could not be determined. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, on the last day of a six-day journey, also asked Roh earlier, while 
signing a guest book, "Is today the 27th?" 
</P>
<P>
Roh nodded and said, "Yes, it's the 27th." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, dissident leader Kim Keun Tae, a former political prisoner and torture 
victim who received the 1987 Robert F. Kennedy human rights award, told 
reporters that the United States "is the source of all suppression and sorrow 
to Korean people since the division of the Korean Peninsula." 
</P>
<P>
Reading a protest letter to Bush, Kim declared that if America's "unreasonable, 
neo-imperialistic interference continues as today, the Korean people's struggle 
for anti-Americanism will (become) more vehement, which is not desireable for 
future, sound U.S.-Korean relations." 
</P>
<P>
Kim was among those arrested in the noon protests. Two other leaders of the 
dissident alliance, Lee Boo Young and Park Kae Dong, were arrested minutes 
later while attempting to hand-deliver their letter of protest to U.S. Embassy 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Pedestrians at the scene, which was decorated with large American and South 
Korean flags, looked on passively and did not attempt to join the protest. The 
government had deployed some 20,000 police to keep the peace in central Seoul, 
and there were no major disturbances as of midday, although a student 
demonstration was planned in the early afternoon at Dong Kuk University. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speech to Assembly 
</P>
<P>
Bush's National Assembly speech was his only major address on the tour, which 
began Wednesday and was scheduled to end this evening when he and First Lady 
Barbara Bush return to Washington. They also visited Tokyo, to attend the state 
funeral of Emperor Hirohito, and Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
While the U.S.-South Korean relationship was founded on the military ties that 
were formed during the Korean War, it has taken on a larger dimension in recent 
years, as the Korean economy has enjoyed spectacular growth and has led the 
once-impoverished nation to the forefront of the developing world. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the President saluted Korean efforts to lower tariffs and other 
trade barriers, but added: 
</P>
<P>
"Let me be candid. If we are to keep our bilateral relationship growing even 
stronger, much more needs to be done. I am confident that our two nations 
working together can accomplish the tasks still before us." 
</P>
<P>
He said that South Korea, "as one of the world's major trading powers," is 
being watched by other nations. 
</P>
<P>
Calling on this "emerging economic leader" to "shoulder important 
responsibilities" to protect the strength and stability of global markets, Bush 
told the Assembly: 
</P>
<P>
"You . . . will face the challenge to improve living standards, to continue to 
open domestic markets and to adopt appropriate international financial and 
exchange rate policies that reflect your standing as a prosperous and powerful 
trading nation." 
</P>
<P>
The Korean economy is the world's 17th largest and in 1988 exported a record 
$61 billion of goods to world markets. In 1987, it achieved a trade surplus 
with the United States of $8.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said his visit reflected "the importance I place on the relations" between 
the United States and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
"You are a world-class economic power; your commitment to democracy is 
demonstrated daily in this chamber," he said, in a rhetorical nod to the 
emerging democracy taking shape in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maintain U.S. Forces 
</P>
<P>
Bush, as have other Presidents, pledged to maintain U.S. forces in South Korea. 
That commitment was affirmed by President Ronald Reagan after President Jimmy 
Carter proposed, but then backed down from, a troop cut. The United States has 
maintained about 43,000 troops in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no plans to reduce U.S. forces in Korea," Bush said. "Our soldiers 
and airmen are there at the request of the Republic of Korea to deter 
aggression from the north, and their presence contributes to the peace and 
stability of northeast Asia. They will remain in the Republic of Korea as long 
as they are needed and as long as we believe it is in the interest of peace to 
keep them there." 
</P>
<P>
Bush also voiced support for "peaceful unification" of North and South Korea 
"on terms acceptable to the Korean people.

SOCCER CLUB SCANDAL PROMPTS ADVICE, LAWYER SAYS;

MANDELA TELLS HIS WIFE TO BE SILENT

<P>
Imprisoned black leader Nelson R. Mandela has instructed his wife to make no 
public statements about the controversy surrounding herself and her band of 
young bodyguards, Winnie Mandela's lawyer said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Looking grim, she refused to talk to reporters after her three-hour visit to 
Victor Verster Prison in Paarl, outside Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, Essa Moosa, refused to give details on the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney would only say that Nelson Mandela instructed his wife not to 
speak publicly about the controversy that has severely damaged her reputation. 
</P>
<P>
The uproar centers on her bodyguards, who called themselves the Mandela United 
soccer club. Anti-apartheid groups have renounced Winnie Mandela for ignoring 
their appeals that she disband the group, claiming that the club has waged a 
"reign of terror" in Soweto, the sprawling black township outside Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
The situation worsened after three people who had direct or indirect links to 
Winnie Mandela and her live-in bodyguards were killed in the last two months. 
Two bodyguards have since been charged with murdering 14-year-old activist 
Stompie Mokhetsi Seipei, whom soccer club members reportedly accused of being a 
police informer. 
</P>
<P>
Winnie Mandela visited her husband Feb. 15 and only recently decided to act on 
his instruction to remove the soccer club members from her house. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-apartheid groups have emphasized they still support Nelson Mandela, head 
of the African National Congress guerrilla movement and the country's best 
known black leader. Mandela has been serving a life sentence in prison since 
1962, when he was convicted of sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought to Help Youths 
</P>
<P>
Winnie Mandela, a trained social worker, formed Mandela United in 1986, saying 
she wanted to organize activities for youths congregating on streets near her 
house. But the group, numbering as many as 30, grew into an unofficial 
bodyguard that seldom played soccer and often antagonized members of the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy came to a head last month when three young men told a Soweto 
community meeting that the bodyguards abducted them Dec. 29 from the Methodist 
church home of the Rev. Paul Verryn, a white pastor. They were taken to 
Mandela's home in Soweto and were beaten. A fourth youth, Seipei, was abducted 
at the same time, said the men, who implicated Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who has denied involvement in Seipei's death and claims there is a 
plot to discredit her, has said her bodyguards were trying to protect the four 
young men, who she asserted were being sexually molested by Verryn. Verryn and 
the Methodist church deny the charges. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC's exiled leaders have appealed to blacks not to shun Winnie Mandela but 
to unite to avoid manipulation by the South African government.

<P>
The Moscow Communist Party daily suggested Sunday that there was little to 
choose among the candidates running for the capital's 26 districts in next 
month's parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
"What was the most striking thing about the first stage of the election?" 
Moscow Pravda asked, referring to the selection and registration of candidates 
for the Congress of People's Deputies, which in turn will elect a new 
parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all it was the complete or virtually complete identity of positions 
in the platforms of the absolute majority of candidates," the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the candidates stand for economic development, helping the 
underprivileged, environmental protection and strengthening democracy, it said. 
"Evidently, to enter into the contest without putting all these points into 
one's program would have been pointless," it added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Procedure Criticized 
</P>
<P>
The paper, which published the full list of candidates, criticized the 
nomination procedure and in particular the voting by show of hands. It 
expressed regret that there were few working class candidates, saying they had 
failed to get the organized backing given to intellectuals. 
</P>
<P>
All the districts have more than one candidate on the ballot, as the new 
electoral law specifies, and in one district, voters will have to choose from 
13 candidates on election day March 26. 
</P>
<P>
A commentary on the elections by Soviet poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, who himself 
narrowly failed to be adopted as a candidate for Moscow's Lenin district, urged 
voters to elect only those candidates advocating genuine change. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not need a Supreme Soviet of subordinates fearing their bosses, or of 
their bosses fearing even higher bosses, or even those bosses who have no 
regard for public opinion or their own consciences," he wrote in the weekly 
Ogonyok. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Utopian Ideas 
</P>
<P>
He called on voters to avoid candidates advocating patching up current problems 
as well as those with Utopian ideas "who hold elevated discussions about a 
state of law, while forgetting people's rights to a roof over their heads." 
</P>
<P>
He said the main tasks of the new parliament, which will hold far greater 
powers than the existing rubber-stamp Supreme Soviet, should include granting 
citizens the right to free foreign travel and the abolition of residence 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
Under the residence permit or propiska system, all Soviet citizens are 
restricted in where they can live. The propiska for the main cities such as 
Moscow and Leningrad are hard to come by for ordinary people who were not born 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Yevtushenko also called for an end to the system of special shops, hospitals 
and services for senior officials as a first stage to solving the country's 
economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Similar calls for an end to special privileges have been made by former Moscow 
party chief Boris N. Yeltsin, who will fight for a seat representing the whole 
of Moscow at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was dropped as a non-voting member of the party's ruling Politburo in 
1988 after criticizing the slow pace of reform. 
</P>
<P>
At an election meeting last week, where Yeltsin was chosen along with a Moscow 
car plant director from a list of 10 candidates, he pledged to open the 
question of a multi-party system to wider discussion.

A cargo door problem on a United Airlines jet forced cancellation of a flight 
to Hong Kong on Sunday, the day the airline said it ordered inspections of the 
doors because of Friday's deadly in-flight accident near Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
A United spokesman said, however, that the incident at Seattle-Tacoma 
International Airport was not related to the special inspections. 
</P>
<P>
In the Seattle case, an electric motor that closes a latch on the cargo-hold 
door was found to be faulty, said Russell Mack, a United spokesman in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
He said the motor was repaired in one to two hours, but by then crew scheduling 
problems forced the flight to be delayed until this morning.

Federal investigators continued to focus on the apparent failure of a cargo 
door on a United Airlines Boeing 747 but conceded that they still have no hard 
evidence as to how that door might have malfunctioned, causing it to rip loose 
in the air near Hawaii and hurl nine people to their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lee V. Dickinson, a member of the National Transportation Safety 
Board, told a nighttime press conference that the door was closed and latched 
electrically before takeoff from Honolulu International Airport in "what 
appeared to be a normal operation. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing abnormal or unusual." 
</P>
<P>
Dickinson said cockpit instruments indicated that the door was properly latched 
before takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
The missing door, probably the single most important piece of evidence, fell in 
15,000 feet of water and probably never will be found, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clasps Also Missing 
</P>
<P>
Missing along with the door are eight claw-like clasps that fit eight locking 
pins at the bottom of the 10-by-10-foot cargo door housing. 
</P>
<P>
Dickinson said the locking pins showed evidence of scoring, or deep scratching, 
but whether that was caused by the ripping of the door away from the craft or 
by normal wear and tear was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
The cargo doors are sealed by a member of the ground crew who flips a toggle 
switch on the outside of the plane, Dickinson said. 
</P>
<P>
After all the clasps and latches are closed, the ground crew member shoves a 
lever, also on the outside of the craft, which closes the two pressure-release 
doors, or vents, in the cargo area so it can be pressurized. At the same time, 
the procedure locks the door. When the process is completed, a light in the 
flight crew's compartment should go out. 
</P>
<P>
The light worked properly Friday, Dickinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the missing door and the still unanswered questions concerning it, 
Dickinson said Sunday that he hoped that investigators will be able to 
determine what caused the malfunction on Flight 811 at 20,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Maintenance Checks 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, United Airlines began special maintenance checks on its entire 
fleet. 
</P>
<P>
The maintenance inspections, described as "over and above" routine airline 
procedures and those required by the Federal Aviation Administration, include 
examination of the cargo doors on each of the 405 aircraft. United said the 
cargo doors on its 31 Boeing 747s already had been checked and found to be in 
working order. 
</P>
<P>
United also said that an FAA-licensed mechanic will inspect each cargo door 
upon a 747's arrival at a destination, in addition to regular pre-departure 
inspections, and that an FAA-licensed mechanic will oversee the closing of each 
747 cargo door before departure. The door closings had been handled by "trained 
ramp service personnel," the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
"By announcing these steps, we want to make clear that we are not speculating 
and will not speculate on the cause of Friday's incident," Stephen M. Wolf, 
United Airlines chairman and chief executive, said. He said the inspections 
signified the airline's "absolute commitment to safety." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
27 Others Injured 
</P>
<P>
Flight 811 was bound for Auckland, New Zealand, with 357 people on board. In 
addition to the nine passengers who were forced out of the jumbo jet in the 
sudden decompression, 27 others were injured. 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. Coast Guard in Hawaii called off a search for bodies and wreckage at 
noon Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"All units were recalled and we don't anticipate any active search into the 
flight mishap, pending further developments," Lt. David Littlejohn said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that since the discovery Friday of a 4-by-6-foot metal piece -- 
believed to be from either the door or the fuselage -- nothing significant had 
been found. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 a.m. Sunday, a load of debris collected at sea was brought to the Coast 
Guard station at Sand Island in the Honolulu area. Littlejohn said a second 
load of debris, containing "miscellaneous pieces . . . that might be associated 
with the mishap" arrived there Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication that any human remains were recovered, Littlejohn said. 
</P>
<P>
After an examination of the 57 pieces of floating debris brought to the Coast 
Guard station, nothing showed evidence of a bomb aboard the jumbo jet, the FBI 
said Sunday, adding that it will disengage itself from the case today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressure Possibility Studied 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the theory that the cargo door somehow opened slightly, and then 
was torn off by the force of a 500-m.p.h. slipstream that rushed over the 
aircraft as it flew through the sky, NTSB investigators are known to be 
exploring another line of reasoning -- that the hole in the aircraft was caused 
when higher air pressure inside the plane blew the door open. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to reinforce 
the cargo doors of certain Boeing 747s after a cargo door came open partially 
in flight. The airlines were given until December, 1989, to install steel 
plates to reinforce the door locks. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA said that airlines could have more time -- until July, 1990 -- to 
install the steel plates if a door had already been reinforced with aluminum 
plates. The FAA required ground crews to check all unreinforced cargo doors 
before each flight to make sure they were locked properly. 
</P>
<P>
United said the cargo door on the Boeing 747 in the accident last week had been 
reinforced with aluminum plates. United and the FAA said the airline had 
complied with the initial portion of the FAA directive, that requiring visual 
inspections by ground crews. 
</P>
<P>
United had inspected all 25 of its jets in the model series covered by the 
order, but by last week had completed the required modifications on just six 
planes. The plane in Friday's accident was not one of those six. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Malnic reported from Honolulu and Denise Gellene from Los Angeles. Staff 
writer Patt Morrison also contributed to this story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FOCUS OF INVESTIGATION 
</P>
<P>
The gaping hole that blew open in the side of a United Airlines Boeing 747 near 
Hawaii Friday may have been caused by the failure of a cargo door. Nine 
passengers were hurled to their deaths from the break in the aircraft's 
fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are seeking the precise cause of the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Marx, senior metallurgist for the National Transportation Safety Board, 
said there was no indication of extraordinary pressure or weight load on the 
cargo door, but added by way of a possible explanation: "Did you ever bust a 
balloon" by blowing it up over and over again?

A bomb exploded at a guardhouse outside the British Consulate in Karachi on 
Sunday night, killing a Pakistani guard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said the blast occurred around 9:35 p.m., when the mission in the 
port city was closed. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosion, but Muslims 
here have been protesting British writer Salman Rushdie's novel, "The Satanic 
Verses." 
</P>
<P>
At least 19 people have been killed in India and Pakistan since Feb. 14, when 
Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, declared that Rushdie 
should be put to death for blaspheming against Islam in his book.

Here are excerpts from Secretary of Defense-designate John Tower's appearance 
Sunday on the ABC-TV show "This Week With David Brinkley." Tower, a former 
senator from Texas, was questioned by Sam Donaldson, George Will and Cokie 
Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 DONALDSON: . . . You heard Sen. (Sam) Nunn this morning suggest that if the 
White House continues to leak, as he sees it . . . portions of that FBI report, 
the (Senate Armed Services) committee ought to resume its hearings and call 
people, put them under subpoena and oath, and take their testimony. Would you 
agree to that? 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: I'm not going to try to advise the committee on what to do, and the 
committee will arrive at its own decision on that. I am no longer a member of 
the committee, and I have found that I'm not . . . don't have a great deal of 
influence over what the committee does. But I am hopeful that we can reduce the 
level of the rhetoric somewhat . . . de-escalate it. 
</P>
<P>
DONALDSON: Would that be a fair thing to do? 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: Well, I think that, in fairness to the White House, they are reacting to 
about three months of solid allegations being poured into the public media; and 
therefore the White House, I think, felt it necessary to refer to the more 
favorable aspects of the report in an effort to shoot down these allegations. 
As you know, in this business, the answer rarely catches up with the charge. 
You can be charged with something on a three-column headline above the fold in 
the paper, and the next day the rebuttal for it or the disproof of it is back 
on the 23rd page somewhere. And I think that that's what the White House was 
responding to. The White House was put on the defensive by all of the 
allegations that came through across the media, and I think that should be 
understood. 
</P>
<P>
. . . I know one thing, and that is that the committee didn't tell me nor did 
the White House tell me . . . they're very meticulous about this . . . what the 
allegations were. And I learned about them by seeing them on television and 
reading them in the newspaper, and that was my first hint . . . that these 
allegations were out there. 
</P>
<P>
DONALDSON: . . . as you know, many of the allegations have to do with, to put 
it rather inelegantly, the charge that you're a common, or uncommon, drunk . . 
. you admitted that, in the '70s, you had a drinking problem. But the 
allegations are that it has persisted. Now, what can you tell us to reassure on 
that point? 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: I would deny that allegation. And what I would like to do, in response 
to that, is to read a portion of a letter that was issued by a doctor who took 
care of me after I was operated on for a colon polyp, in which a very thorough 
examination was made. And I will not read the entire letter, although the 
entire letter I think is very revealing. 
</P>
<P>
DONALDSON: It will be made part of the record? 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: Yes, it will be made part of the record. I would like to read the . . . 
last paragraph. It says: "In summary, Sen. Tower had normal liver function 
tests, with pre-op evaluation, had a normal liver at the time of surgery, and 
exhibited no evidence of alcohol withdrawal post-operatively. On the contrary, 
he was at work continuously, almost from the time he left the recovery room. 
Based on these facts, it can be stated with relative certainty that Sen. Tower 
shows no evidence at all of alcoholic impairment or alcoholism." 
</P>
<P>
DONALDSON: Who is that doctor? 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: "It is my professional view that there is little basis for statements 
made concerning the possible impairment by alcohol of his ability to perform 
his duty as secretary of defense." It was made by Dr. Warren Lichliter of 
Baylor Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
. . . Now, what I want to do is to try to remove the obstacles to my 
confirmation. I've already gone a step further than I'm required to on 
recusals, more than the law requires me to do. And I'd like to take another 
step, which I hope will remove what appears to be the principal obstacle and 
the principal concern expressed by Sen. Nunn and other senators, and I would 
like to read this pledge, if you want to call it that. Noting the principal 
concern of Sen. Nunn and other members of the Senate, relative to my 
confirmation as secretary of defense, namely the extent to which I may engage 
in excessive use of beverage alcohol, let me state that I have never been an 
alcoholic nor dependent on alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
However, to allay any fears or doubts on this matter, I hereby swear and 
undertake that, if confirmed, during the course of my tenure as secretary of 
defense, I will not consume beverage alcohol of any type or form, including 
wine, beer or spirits of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
WILL: Was there a point prior to this pledge, which is a quite decisive one, 
was there any point at which you did, you could point to and say: 'There, I 
changed.' 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: Yes. Twelve years, I gave up spirits. I used to be a pretty good Scotch 
drinker. And I gave up, I haven't tasted Scotch in 12 years. After that I had 
only wine. Had perhaps an occasional martini, occasionally a little vodka with 
smoked salmon or caviar or something like that. But that was just occasionally. 
I really essentially have been a wine drinker. And now, my only consumption is 
wine at meals. I don't drink wine even unless I'm eating. 
</P>
<P>
WILL: Now, Sen. Nunn says that it would be unfortunate to reopen these hearings 
and put people under oath. Do you, I know you don't want to give the committee 
advice, but do you think it would be unfortunate to you? That is, what do you 
have to lose at this point, the committee having already . . . 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: I don't think it would be . . . 
</P>
<P>
WILL: . . . voted against you. 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: . . . because I've probably, my reputation and character have been 
damaged as much as they can be by the allegations that have already been 
floated. So, I have high confidence that, if it were a balanced presentation, 
that is to say, if both favorable and unfavorable witnesses were subpoenaed, 
that I have high confidence I would come out on top. I think around 400 people 
were interviewed in the FBI inquiry. I have been more thoroughly investigated 
and more thoroughly scrutinized than any public figure. 
</P>
<P>
DONALDSON: Senator . . . by making that pledge today, it seems to me you're 
admitting you have a drinking problem. 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: I anticipated that question, Sam, because, in vetting this with some of 
my friends, they said that's the spin that would be put on it . . . . No, I 
said in the statement that I am not an alcoholic nor have I ever been dependent 
on alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
DONALDSON: Then why would you make a pledge when you say there's no reason to? 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: Why not? Well, why not make it? It's a small thing to do to allay doubts 
and fears. I didn't have to recuse myself on matters of suspension and 
disbarment involving former clients of mine. But I did so anyway. I took that 
extra step. This is an extra step that is really not terribly significant as 
far as I'm concerned. As far as my own personal . . . . 
</P>
<P>
DONALDSON: I must say, senator . . . . 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: It is not an admission. I just . . . . 
</P>
<P>
DONALDSON: Where does it end? 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: Wait a minute. I just read the letter from my doctor who . . . and there 
is no proof that I have a chronic problem. And, so, I think that this . . . 
nobody has ever accused me of being dishonest and not being a man of my word . 
. . and I will live in a goldfish bowl, so there will be plenty of enforcers 
out there. 
</P>
<P>
DONALDSON: . . . Now, when allegations are raised that you're a womanizer, 
should you take a pledge not to go out with women? 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: I'm a single man. I do date women. 
</P>
<P>
DONALDSON: Well, exactly. I'm asking you . . . . 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: I've been a single man for 3 1/2 . . . . 
</P>
<P>
DONALDSON: When you start down this road . . . . 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: What is your definition of 'womanizing,' Sam? 
</P>
<P>
DONALDSON: Well, it's not mine. The accusations . . . 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: Well . . . . 
</P>
<P>
DONALDSON: . . . are made against you and may have no basis in fact. 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: But womanize is a broad term. What is your definition of the term? 
</P>
<P>
DONALDSON: I don't know. I simply . . . 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: Well, all right. 
</P>
<P>
DONALDSON: . . . say to you that if you take . . . 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: Cokie, do you have a definition of the term? 
</P>
<P>
ROBERTS: Well, I think most women have a . . . know it when they see it, 
senator. But . . . . 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: Uh-huh. But, you still can't define it. 
</P>
<P>
DONALDSON: Sen. Tower, Sen. Nunn said today that he asked whether you would 
consent to having doctors inspect you along with your own personal physicians, 
to having people who are trained in alcoholism in the medical profession, and 
you said: "No." You wouldn't do it. 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: Wait a minute. All I remember of a conversation with Sen. Nunn was after 
he viewed my medical report, I guess about a month ago. I suggested that he 
could name any doctors that he wanted to interrogate my doctors. Now, that's as 
far as it went. And he said he might do that. I did not object to such . . . 
but I don't really think that's . . . that would be saying that my doctors are 
not men of professional integrity. And there could be another supporting 
statement from two other doctors that attended me. 
</P>
<P>
DONALDSON: Well, would you . . . . 
</P>
<P>
TOWER: And, too, wait a minute, friend. Let me add something else, that the FBI 
went through my medical records back from 1975 and came up with the same thing, 
that there's no evidence. Now, I don't know what an examination by an 
independent doctor would tell you other than what's already been said by my 
existing medical records. Would it be a psychiatric examination or something 
like that? No, I'm not going to submit to that, and why should I? No other 
Cabinet nominee has ever been required to do that. Members of the Senate or of 
the House are not required to do that. I think that you take my doctors' word 
on the basis of their professional competence. And they can be interviewed by 
other doctors of the committee's own choosing.

LAST-DITCH PUSH FOR TOWER TROUBLED; 
</P>
<P>
MATSUNAGA, PRESSLER VIEWS COUNTER WHITE HOUSE EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Even as White House aides worked feverishly on a last-ditch strategy for saving 
John Tower's nomination as defense secretary, they were confronted Sunday with 
fresh evidence of just how hard that task will be. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue plan was put together in weekend meetings and frantic telephone 
calls between Frederick D. McClure, the chief White House lobbyist, and White 
House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, who was traveling with President Bush in 
Asia. The strategy involves holding the support of all 45 GOP senators while 
President Bush wins over a handful of the Senate's 55 Democrats through 
personal meetings in the Oval Office on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But on Sunday, Sen. Larry Pressler of South Dakota, one of at least two 
wavering Republicans, said in an interview that "I'm leaning very much against" 
the nominee because of Tower's lucrative dealings with defense contractors 
after he left the Senate. Senate Republican leader Bob Dole seemed visibly 
surprised when reporters at a press conference Sunday informed him of 
Pressler's statements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Predicts Defeat 
</P>
<P>
And one of the Democrats Bush hoped to persuade, Sen. Spark M. Matsunaga of 
Hawaii, told The Times he has turned down an invitation to meet with Bush and 
plans to vote no. "It's headed for defeat," Matsunaga said. "I don't think they 
can get five Democrats and they'll probably lose a few Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
The statements by Pressler and Matsunaga reflect the daunting dimensions of the 
obstacles facing White House strategists. Among the problems: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The allegations of drinking, womanizing and carrying on unusually lucrative 
consultant relationships with major defense contractors cover such a wide 
spectrum and concern matters of such sensitivity for a Pentagon chief that 
rebutting all of them can be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to oppose John Tower, you can say, 'Oh there's this,' " and then 
ask, " 'What about this, and what about this?' " said Dole. If opponents shift 
from one objection to another, he added, "That game you can't win." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nunn's Influence Key 
</P>
<P>
 -- Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), who led the inquiry 
that resulted in the committee's 11-9 party-line vote against Tower, is a 
moderate-to-conservative Democrat who enjoys enormous influence in the area of 
national defense and commands particular support among the Southern Democrats 
Bush is targeting for conversion. 
</P>
<P>
"If Nunn is deadly serious and puts his prestige on the line, then it's over," 
said one longtime Republican operative who was consulted in developing the 
White House strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As the confrontation has sharpened, partisan lines have inevitably begun to 
harden. A straight party-line vote on the floor would be fatal for Bush. 
Recognizing that, Dole sought to turn down the heat: 
</P>
<P>
"What we need to do is start backing away from what appears to be right now a 
pitched partisan battle," Dole said at a hastily called press conference. "Why 
don't we reassess it, sit down like we do on a lot of things? . . . We are men 
and women of good will there." 
</P>
<P>
Historically, presidents have almost always been given a free hand in selecting 
members of their Cabinet. And the present Senate has raised few questions about 
Bush's nominees -- except for Tower. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Encouragement 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Matsunaga, Democrats on the White House target list who could be 
reached Sunday offered little encouragement to the White House efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.), for example, said Tower's pledge to stop drinking 
entirely if confirmed could be "a positive thing." But, he said: "There's a 
higher question: Is he the best we can find? . . . It's not just the drinking 
thing, it's a character thing." 
</P>
<P>
On the Republican side, White House vote counters concede they are unsure of 
Sens. Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa in 
addition to Pressler. Grassley, whose mail has been running heavily against 
Tower, said Sunday that "no senator should state his position until he has read 
the (FBI) report," which he has not yet done. 
</P>
<P>
Kassebaum has said that if she were in Tower's position, she would withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
"People now are beginning to make their minds up," said Sen. David Pryor of 
Arkansas, a Democratic moderate. "It would take a sharp, dramatic turnaround" 
to change them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mail Volume Grows 
</P>
<P>
In addition, as Grassley's example shows, the growing volume of constituent 
mail telling senators to vote against Tower has complicated the White House 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
To counter those problems, Bush advisers say they hope to use everything from 
traditional pork barrel pitches aimed at military installations in senators' 
states to appeals to personal and family ties. And they maintain that Tower 
substantially helped the cause with his televised temperance pledge Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday, I'd say 90-10 against," said one White House adviser in describing 
the odds on Tower's winning Senate confirmation. "Today, I'd say 60-40. 
Sixty-forty ain't great, but it's better than it was." 
</P>
<P>
Two Democrats whom Bush aides consider crucial are Sens. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas 
and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut. Bentsen and Tower served together in 
the Texas delegation for many years. And Bentsen gave Tower a warm introduction 
to the Armed Services Committee when it began the confirmation process, though 
the former Democratic vice presidential candidate has not indicated how he will 
vote on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
As for the liberal Dodd, he is thought to be sympathetic to the nominee because 
Tower years ago was one of a small number of senators who voted no when the 
Senate censured Dodd's father, the late Sen. Thomas Dodd. 
</P>
<P>
In his meetings, aides say, Bush will emphasize the nearly unprecedented nature 
of a Senate rejection of a President's Cabinet choice and argue that the blow 
would weaken his ability to work with foreign leaders on defense issues. In 
addition, he may appeal to several senators who are former governors by arguing 
that they should understand the importance of a chief executive being able to 
pick the members of his own team, an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jeopardize State Interests 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Administration aides are also counting on senators "not wanting to 
jeopardize military interests in their states" by being the vote that kills the 
nomination, a key aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the senators whom Bush is most counting on to save the nomination 
-- conservative and moderate Southern and Border State Democrats -- may be 
among those who would find Tower most difficult to support. Nunn has been for 
several years a key leader of conservative Democrats who favor a stronger 
defense, and his like-minded Senate colleagues have substantial political 
reasons for wanting to see his stature increase. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, aides say senators from conservative states are the ones who have 
been hearing most often from constituents upset by the allegations of personal 
misconduct by Tower. 
</P>
<P>
Staff writers William J. Eaton, Sara Fritz and Paul Houston contributed to this 
story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A DATE WITH THE PRESIDENT 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, needing at least five Democratic votes to win Senate approval 
of John Tower as defense secretary, has invited 12 Democratic senators to the 
White House for a lobbying pitch Tuesday. They include: 
</P>
<P>
1. Lloyd Bentsen, Texas . . . A fellow Texan who accompanied Tower at the 
beginning of Senate hearings on the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
2. Bill Bradley, New Jersey . . . Generally open-minded senator who supported 
Reagan on Contra aid, was allied with him on tax revision. 
</P>
<P>
3. John B. Breaux, Louisiana . . . Like other Southern conservatives, shares 
many of Tower's views on defense. 
</P>
<P>
4. Christopher J. Dodd, Connecticut . . Liberal but may feel grateful that 
Tower defended his father, the late Sen. Thomas Dodd (D-Conn.), against censure 
by the Senate in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
5. Bob Graham, Florida . . . Southern conservative, former governor who may be 
sympathetic to the argument that a chief executive should be able to pick his 
own advisers. 
</P>
<P>
6. Howell Heflin, Alabama . . . Southern conservative who calls himself a 
friend of Tower. 
</P>
<P>
7. Ernest F. Hollings, South Carolina . . . Southern conservative, former 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
8. Daniel K. Inouye, Hawaii . . . Worked closely with Tower on several Senate 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
9. J. Bennett Johnston, Louisiana . . . Southern conservative. 
</P>
<P>
10. Charles S. Robb, Virginia . . . Southern conservative, former governor. 
</P>
<P>
11. Terry Sanford, North Carolina . . . Southern conservative, former governor. 
</P>
<P>
12. Spark M. Matsunaga, Hawaii . . . Worked closely with Tower on several 
Senate issues, but has already turned down invitation and has announced his 
opposition.

MORE FEDERAL CUTS LIE AHEAD, GOVERNORS' CONFERENCE WARNED 
</P>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee told the nation's governors Sunday 
that "we're fresh out of cash here in Washington," and warned that more fiscal 
pain lies ahead for the states. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) disclaimed any intention to "launch an assault" on 
President Bush or his budget plan, but added that the White House was following 
"a most unorthodox approach" to the deficit negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Sasser was the principal speaker at the opening session of the mid-winter 
meeting of the National Governors' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration was not represented because Richard G. Darman, the White 
House budget director, declined an invitation to attend. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fair Share' of Cuts 
</P>
<P>
"All the governors understand we have to take our fair share of cuts to deal 
with deficit reduction, and we've done that," Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Blanchard, a Democrat, said the states were hard-pressed to meet new 
obligations placed on them by the federal government without the funds to pay 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't take continued mandated automatic expenditures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Gov. Gerald L. Baliles, a Democrat who is chairman of the governors' 
group, opened the session by pointing out that the amount budgeted to pay 
interest on the federal debt "now exceeds spending on all domestic 
discretionary programs." 
</P>
<P>
Sasser disputed some of the economic assumptions made by the Bush 
Administration, particularly its forecast that interest rates will decline to 
5.5% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Sasser said that while the Administration predicts a balanced budget by 1993, 
the Congressional Budget Office forecasts a $75-billion deficit for that year. 
</P>
<P>
Blanchard, a former member of Congress, said he was confused by the process 
being used to reach a budget agreement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unorthodox Approach' 
</P>
<P>
"We're confused ourselves this year," Sasser said. "This is a most unorthodox 
approach." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Administration had simply left many budget areas blank and left it 
to Congress to suggest where cuts ought to be made. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little like you going to your state legislatures with your budget and 
just taking about half of it and throwing it up in the air and saying, 'OK, 
fellow, here it is, you solve it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sasser said that while Bush is asking for line-item veto power, a budgetary 
tool many governors have, "he refuses to offer the Congress this year a 
line-item budget."

More than 25 minor earthquakes shook Costa Rica on Sunday, frightening some 
residents but causing no injuries or major damage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The National Seismology Network said the first quake struck at 6:21 a.m. and 
registered a magnitude of between 4.3 and 4.8. About 25 weaker quakes rattled 
the country during the next four hours, only about five of which could be felt 
by residents, the network said.

<P>
All the quakes were centered about 40 miles south of San Jose.

MAN IN MIDST OF STORM HAS A TURBULENT PAST; 
</P>
<P>
PRESSURE TO NAME CONVENTION CENTER AFTER KING INSPIRED ROLE AS LEADER OF 
OPPOSITION GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To most, Robert Lee Pruett came out of nowhere to become the leader of those 
vehemently opposed to renaming San Diego's new convention center after the Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
It is a role Pruett says he didn't seek, but which circumstances forced upon 
him. Yet he has taken to it with alacrity. 
</P>
<P>
Who is this man in the middle of the storm? 
</P>
<P>
He is highly opinionated and focused on the name-change issue. He is a high 
school drop-out who joined the Marine Corps at 17, went to Vietnam in the '60s 
and eventually earned his high school degree in the service. He is meticulous 
in dress and measured in demeanor. He moved to San Diego three years ago. He is 
single and retired at age 42 and is thinking about more travel around the world 
for the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
He also has a troubled financial past, a former operator of nursing homes in 
San Diego, Orange and Los Angeles counties whose remnant of a company faces 
more than $100,000 in state fines for ill treatment of patients, some of whom 
died. 
</P>
<P>
He and his company, financially strapped, have been forced out of the 
convalescent hospitals they operated. His attorney has dropped him as a client 
for not paying several thousand dollars in legal bills. He is involved in at 
least seven court cases. He has told one court that he is on the verge of 
filing for bankruptcy. A former business partner who is now suing him claims 
Pruett was out to make a "quick buck." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposition Reasons Vary 
</P>
<P>
Since early last month, when the San Diego City Council voted to rename the 
center, Pruett has been the point man for the opposition, a loosely knit group 
of people called Citizens to Keep the Name San Diego Convention Center. Like 
all of the public opposition that has surfaced so far, the group is white, many 
of them middle-aged or elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Some are opposed because they say the city has done enough to honor King, and 
some say they are angry because the politicians at City Hall have ignored the 
will of the people as expressed in a referendum two years ago stripping King's 
name off Market Street. But others degraded King himself -- calling him a 
communist and a womanizer -- and blacks in general in some of the ugliest 
public testimony last week ever heard in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Pruett doesn't condone the denigration, but he makes no apologies for it, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people have a right to express their feelings, even if they are 
racists," he said in an interview. "I would hope that would not be their sole 
motivation for supporting keeping the name the San Diego Convention Center. But 
. . . regardless of their motivation, I think they have a right to speak. I 
think what's really important is that, as much as possible, that it be 
channeled." 
</P>
<P>
That channel is the threat -- or the promise, as Pruett calls it -- to launch a 
referendum if the City Council and the Board of Port Commissioners do indeed 
name the center, which is due to open in late fall, after King. The prospects 
of the renaming are now uncertain because the port commissioners have proposed 
a compromise being evaluated by the City Council. If accepted, the complex 
would remain the San Diego Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Wes Pratt, the only black member of the City Council and the person 
who has led the fight for the renaming, said that though he doesn't think 
Pruett's reasoning is valid, he respects him for having the courage to speak 
his mind in public, instead of working behind the scenes as others are. 
</P>
<P>
"Martin Luther King would have promoted participation in the process," 
</P>
<P>
Pratt said. " 'Let the process work' -- that's what he wanted to give us." 
</P>
<P>
Though Pruett has lived in San Diego only since January, 1986, having moved 
here from Orange County, he is no stranger to the city. He visited often and 
had a boat docked here. He did business here at three convalescent hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
He was aware of the highly publicized debate concerning renaming Market Street 
for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., though he played no role in it. It was 
clear to him, he said, that when voters overwhelmingly approved a referendum 
taking King's name off and restoring Market Street, the public was sending a 
"clear mandate" to Mayor Maureen O'Connor and the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
But he became worried in December, he said, when a citizens tribute committee 
appointed by the City Council -- a committee he said was nothing more than a 
"smoke screen" -- recommended changing the name of the new $160-million 
convention center. 
</P>
<P>
"I became very concerned because . . . they were taking the convention center," 
he said. He sent a letter to the mayor. The response, he said, was basically 
"tough." That was the beginning of his crusade, and it sparked the bitter 
animosity he holds for the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testified at Council Meeting 
</P>
<P>
His first foray into the public arena occurred Jan. 10, at the meeting at which 
the City Council voted 7-2 for the renaming. He testified and placed outside in 
the council chambers copies of the letter he had sent to the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"While I was at the council meeting," he said, "90% of the people who stood up 
and spoke in support of the name, directly or indirectly, said that anyone in 
opposition was in fact a racist. I resent that. I resented it then. I'm not a 
racist." 
</P>
<P>
Disgusted with the outcome of the vote, he said he waited three days to see 
whether anyone would pick up the opposition's banner. In the meantime, people 
who had read copies of his letter began calling him. 
</P>
<P>
"I waited . . . hoping that someone else would step out and provide leadership 
on the issue," he said. "I didn't feel that we had the time to waste, and 
that's how I got involved." 
</P>
<P>
Thus began the referendum threat, the letter-writing campaign, the circulation 
of petitions eventually signed by almost 5,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll notice the City Council continually says the vote on Market Street was 
not a mandate. The City Council continues to say that they set up a process and 
that if we didn't participate in it, it was our loss," Pruett said. "Well, many 
of us saw that process. We saw the setting up of the advisory tribute board as 
a smoke screen." 
</P>
<P>
So on one level Pruett opposes the process used to propel the name change, a 
process he said was rigged. But there are other reasons, too. He said he 
respects King for what he accomplished and the attention he brought to civil 
rights, but he said San Diego has done enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no objections to honoring him. But I agree with a lot of the members of 
this committee, enough's enough. After all, there is a school, there is a park; 
a million-four was spent for a community center in that park. The idea that his 
wife, Coretta King, would come to San Diego and tell the City Council that they 
weren't doing enough to honor him, I think is somewhat appalling. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly, San Diego is not a historically significant civil-rights city. 
I'm not saying we don't have some civil-rights issues, but it's not significant 
historically, and I don't think we have the responsibility to make an 
international statement regarding an issue that's not significant for us." 
</P>
<P>
There is also another, more personal reason behind his attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a certain concern over his attitudes toward those people that did go to 
Vietnam and did serve." 
</P>
<P>
Pruett can't remember specific details, he said King "accused people that went 
to Vietnam and fought as murderers and things of that sort, not recognizing 
that, regardless of whether or not it was a popular war, we were still fighting 
for all of the peoples." 
</P>
<P>
"What I find sad is the people that continue to follow him even in his death 
and state that they know what he thinks," Pruett said. "They state they know 
what he would do and what he would think and feel." 
</P>
<P>
King wouldn't want his name on a building if it caused "this strife and 
division," he said. "And yet they go ahead, in spite of that, (and) insist, 
persist and demand that his name be put in concrete and steel. I have a problem 
understanding that and dealing with it." 
</P>
<P>
Pruett was 17 when he dropped out of high school in Chillicothe, Ill., and 
joined the Marines. He went to boot camp in San Diego and eventually was 
shipped as an infantryman to Vietnam, where he served in 1965-66. He saw combat 
and was stationed in Phu Bai and Chu Lai. "I wasn't wounded nor was I a hero. I 
did my job and I returned," he said. After four years in the Marines, he was 
discharged as a sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
He had a few odd jobs in Orange County, and worked briefly for Walt Disney 
Productions Inc. in their cash-control department. But Disney wanted to 
transfer him to Florida, and he wanted to stay in California. He quit and 
decided to go into health care. He attended Fullerton Junior College, with the 
idea of majoring in business administration, but he dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, he founded South Coast Care Inc., according to the California 
Secretary of State's office. The company, which the state suspended in April, 
1987, for failure to file economic-status forms, was formed as a nonprofit firm 
to run nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money Maker Ran Homes 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Care was nonprofit, but Pruett also formed Coastal Management 
Services Inc., a for-profit corporation of which he was the sole stockholder, 
according to court records. Under a system devised by Pruett, South Coast Care 
would receive the state license to operate a nursing home and pay Coastal 
Management to run it. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Care, which had headquarters in various places, including 
Huntington Beach and Long Beach, operated two convalescent hospitals, a 99-bed 
facility in Compton and a 147-bed nursing home in Long Beach, and paid Coastal 
Management a $23,500 monthly fee to be the day-to-day manager. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Pruett's South Coast Care agreed to merge with another convalescent 
home company, Health Care Enterprises Inc. of San Clemente, which operated four 
nursing homes. Among them were the 92-bed Meadowlark Convalescent Hospital, 
8001 Birmingham Drive in Kearny Mesa, and the 94-bed San Diego Convalescent 
Hospital, 3740 Massachusetts Ave., La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary merger agreement, South Coast Care would take over 
the licenses of all six nursing homes and have them operated by Health Care 
Enterprises. Pruett was named vice president of Health Care Enterprises and 
placed in charge of running the facilities, according to court and state 
Department of Health Services documents. Starting in October, 1983, Pruett was 
paid $15,000 a month, along with an entertainment and travel allowance of 
$2,500 a month, according to the records. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, things were going smoothly. But in 1985, the state made a 
series of surprise inspections, the results of which spelled the end to the 
merger and the demise of Pruett's business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Multitude of Violations 
</P>
<P>
The state found systematic problems at some of the six facilities. The most 
extreme cases of alleged inadequate care were found at Meadowlark and the 
Bristol Care Center nursing home in Santa Ana. As a result, the state fined 
South Coast Care at least $110,000 for a multitude of violations, penalties 
that remain largely uncollected. The cases are pending in Superior Court in San 
Diego and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Meadowlark, state officials said two elderly patients died after 
receiving poor care. 
</P>
<P>
That same month, South Coast Care was fined $1,000 for violations at the San 
Diego Convalescent Hospital involving the treatment of a 92-year-old man who 
later died there. 
</P>
<P>
Though the problems at Meadowlark were serious, according to the state, things 
may have been worse at South Coast's 146-bed Bristol nursing home in Santa Ana. 
There, the state has fined South Coast $80,000 for a variety of violations, 
including an incident in which a 41-year-old patient choked to death on food. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Care was eventually forced out of all the nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
Pruett declined to talk about the nursing home problems or his other business 
problems. He said the convalescent homes had problems before his company became 
involved and "what happened is a culmination of activities that had occurred 
before South Coast" took over. He also said his business dealings are not 
relevant to the convention center issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I have resigned," he said. "I'm no longer involved with that organization. I 
did in fact retire and as far as I'm concerned, I've left that behind me." 
</P>
<P>
His former business partner, Hoyt Crider, certainly doesn't think so. He has 
doggedly pursued a suit since 1985 against Pruett. Crider -- owner of Health 
Care Enterprises, the firm involved in the merger -- said Pruett broke off the 
merger after Crider paid $102,000 for various improvements at the nursing 
homes, such as installing solar heating equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted out after that. I think he was out for the quick buck," Crider said. 
</P>
<P>
Told of Crider's comment, Pruett said, "He said that? Look, I don't have 
anything to apologize for. . . . That's all I want to say." 
</P>
<P>
Among the allegations contained in Crider's suit filed in Orange County is 
that, in September, 1984, South Coast Care signed a 20-year lease to acquire 
the 70-year-old Blackstone Hotel in Long Beach without his knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used Funds to Pay for Deficit 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that from September, 1984, to March, 1985, South Coast Care 
used money generated by the four nursing homes previously owned by Health Care 
Enterprises -- amounting to $150,000 -- to pay for the operating deficit at the 
Blackstone, which was running at $26,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Crider alleges that income from the two nursing homes originally owned by South 
Coast Care was not touched to pay for the Blackstone deficits. In March, 1985, 
South Coast Care abandoned its Blackstone lease, which caused the hotel's 
owners to file a lawsuit seeking $250,000 in damages. Pruett alleged that the 
building's owners had covered up problems involved in bringing the building up 
to earthquake standards. A confidential settlement in the case was reached in 
January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Pruett represented himself in the settlement, after his lawyer, Mitchell 
Samuelsen of Orange County, dropped out because Pruett didn't pay his legal 
bills of $17,517. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter Pruett sent last September to the judge hearing Crider's lawsuit, 
Pruett said that "South Coast Care Corp. has arranged . . . to file a Chapter 7 
bankruptcy, and Robert L. Pruett has arranged and paid for an attorney to 
complete a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. There are no assets to be liquidated and no 
funds to be distributed." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the federal government at one time imposed tax liens against South 
Coast Care of more than $60,000; an El Cajon physical therapist said he is owed 
$49,618 because of work done at Meadowlark, and a San Diego pharmacy company 
was forced in 1985 to attach a South Coast Care bank account in Beverly Hills 
to collect a $22,200 bill. 
</P>
<P>
As for the future, Pruett, a life-long registered Democrat, said he has no 
immediate interest in politics. He once ran for the City Council in Laguna 
Beach in the mid-'70s. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no political ambitions. This is not a steppingstone to anything for me. 
My intention is to continue traveling for another two or three years and at 
that time, I may settle in and become intimately involved with the city, its 
politics and its activities." 
</P>
<P>
His only focus right now, he said, is to keep King's name off the convention 
center. He has no plans to continue his opposition group for any other purpose. 
If the City Council accepts the Port District's compromise -- and at the end of 
the week the council was leaning in the direction of a compromise -- Pruett 
said he will consider the matter closed. If the council doesn't, and the 
renaming goes to a referendum, Pruett said that will be the end of the battle. 
</P>
<P>
"The people have a right to speak. Regardless of how it goes, I would feel 
satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
Whichever way it happens, Pruett is confident his side will win. And what will 
be the message to the country if that occurs? 
</P>
<P>
"I think you are going to hear people in cities standing up and saying, 'We 
appreciate the actions of the city of San Diego in that they are not bowing to 
the threat of racism. They aren't bowing to the club of racism that has been 
used so effectively by the black community in particular to accomplish their 
goals.' I think that's what you are going to hear coming from the nation."

INMATES BUOYED WHEN THEY MEET THEIR MATCH -- A REAL PAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Every 10 days or so, Homer Kindschi, 73, spends four to five hours -- playing 
dominoes, checkers and just plain talking -- with inmate Clyde Porch, who was 
sentenced in 1986 to 11 years at Donovan Correctional Facility on Otay Mesa for 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
"The visit seems like it would be a long time, but when you're doing something 
you enjoy, it's not a long time," Kindschi, of La Mesa, said. 
</P>
<P>
Kindschi is a volunteer in the M-2, or "Match Two," Prisoner Outreach Program, 
an 18-year-old statewide program in its second year in San Diego. The program 
matches inmates with volunteers to act as role models, help increase their 
self-esteem and -- more importantly -- to just be friends. 
</P>
<P>
"One-third of all inmates are forgotten, and the person thrown away is most 
likely to fail," said Barry Lord, San Diego director of M-2. 
</P>
<P>
"There are currently 80,000 inmates in the (state prison) system. There will be 
110,000 by the year 1990, and they will come out worse than when they went in. 
Approximately 98% of all inmates are going to get out. The question is, what 
are they going to be like when they get out?" 
</P>
<P>
About 72% of the parolees are going to fail when they are released from prison, 
Lord said, "but if they have an M-2 volunteer, according to statistics in a 
1987 report given to the California Department of Corrections, more than 61% 
succeed." 
</P>
<P>
The basis for befriending prisoners is because "They'll be back," warned Sam 
Huddleston, an ex-felon-turned-minister and president of the M-2 program. 
"Prison has a way of eating your self-esteem. . . . We want to make the 
community a better place to live by changing the lives of prisoners before they 
come back." 
</P>
<P>
The program, begun in 1971, operates in 35 prisons throughout California and 
has matched more than 32,000 inmates with M-2 volunteers, Lord said. There are 
150 volunteers in San Diego's program, which costs about $50,000 to run at 
Donovan. 
</P>
<P>
About 70% is paid for by the state; the rest comes from corporations, churches 
and individuals who are interested in reducing crime, Lord said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Based on Bible 
</P>
<P>
"The concept of M-2 really began in the Bible, 2,000 years ago," Lord said. "In 
the first chapter of 2 Timothy, Verse 16, it speaks of Oneisiphorus, who 
searched the sewers of Rome diligently to find Paul the Apostle, who was 
imprisoned. God commands us not to leave them in prison and rot but to visit 
them. (M-2) is not a religious outreach, but it's based on Christian concepts." 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the volunteers are Christians, but in befriending a 
prisoner, Lord said, "We don't beat him over the head with a Bible; there's no 
jamming of religion down anybody's throat. We tell volunteers to just walk, who 
you are, in front of him. He will see who you are." 
</P>
<P>
The M-2 volunteers are from all professions: doctors, attorneys, plumbers, 
carpenters, retired men and pastors, from age 22 to 87, Lord said. He recruits 
them from various community organizations, such as Rotary and Kiwanis clubs, 
churches and other men's organizations. 
</P>
<P>
For now, there is only a men's outreach in San Diego, but Lord said he and his 
wife, Peggy, are laying the groundwork for a women's outreach that might be in 
operation soon. There are about five women's programs in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Sandy O'Neill, administrative assistant to the superintendent at Donovan, 
said M-2 is "very worthwhile and working very well at Donovan. It offers a lot 
to inmates who are confined, who have no one to visit them and gives them a 
positive influence from the community." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill said she has seen the program's success when she worked at the 
California Institution for Men at Chino and at the California Rehabilitation 
Center at Norco. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say I've seen dramatic personality changes, but by having someone come 
in to visit, it provides a different recreation from someone who's positive 
from the community and who will provide support when they are paroled." 
</P>
<P>
Kindschi, a retired custodial supervisor from the San Diego Unified School 
District, joined M-2 in December, 1987, after Lord made a video presentation 
about the program at his church. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Knew It Was Lonely' 
</P>
<P>
"I just had the desire to meet someone who needed a visitor," Kindschi said. "I 
knew what the place was like, and I knew it was lonely." 
</P>
<P>
The general criterion for prisoners who apply to participate in the program is 
that they have been abandoned by their family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, volunteers are carefully screened and trained before being 
matched with one of Donovan's 3,248 inmates, Lord said. "We don't want 
prisoners already deserted by the world to then be deserted by the volunteers. 
The volunteer walks in when the world walks out." 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers receive extensive training, which includes orientation seminars 
and learning listening skills. There is also ongoing supervision and support 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
Kindschi was matched with Porch and met with him almost every week for six 
months, until he had open-heart surgery after a stroke in June. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I go about every 10 days," Kindschi said. "I think so much of Clyde; I 
just want to give him all the time I can." 
</P>
<P>
He sends Porch books to read and writes to him regularly. 
</P>
<P>
"When he gets out, I'll do what I can to help him find a job. . . . I'll try to 
keep in contact." 
</P>
<P>
Porch, 35, has been serving an 11-year sentence for manslaughter since 1986, 
when he stabbed a man to death during a fight at his job in Los Angeles. He 
hopes he will only have to serve five years, and he is working as an 
educational porter at the prison school to cut his time. He wants to earn an 
associate's degree in general studies from Southwestern College and is also 
thinking about going into the ministry when he is released. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants to Volunteer Some Day 
</P>
<P>
Nicknamed "Preacher" by his friends, Porch said the program is great but there 
aren't enough sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
"I made myself honorary M-2 coordinator for my building," Porch said proudly. 
"I know 50 inmates who want friends, and I want to be a volunteer in the 
program when I get out." 
</P>
<P>
Porch said he and Kindschi get along so well because they both share the same 
commitment to God. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted a Christian visitor. I just figured I'd get along better with a 
Christian. This program lets me know somebody cares about me, no matter where I 
go. That makes me feel good; everybody has to have somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers admit that there is bound to be some apprehension, felt by both 
inmate and volunteer, when meeting their matches for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Smith, a 35-year-old fire captain at the Imperial Beach Fire Department, 
said that when he first visited his match, "I was a little apprehensive. 
Everybody is on both sides of the table. People say to me, 'Why do you go to 
see these lunatics? They're not worth bothering with.' And even I didn't know 
what to expect, but he was a regular guy. He just made a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer Norm Graham, 50, of Lakeside said his first response to visiting his 
match was "fear and trepidation . . . of the unknown. I wondered, How do you 
handle this? I wondered, Is he a con artist? We often feel that if we put our 
hand out to help someone, it's going to get bitten." 
</P>
<P>
But after three months, Graham, a self-employed businessman, was so comfortable 
he brought his wife with him to meet his match, Vernon DeMoss. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friendship a Key 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good experience for the whole family," he said. "The basis is helping a 
man get his life back together through friendship." 
</P>
<P>
DeMoss is now like a member of the family, and calls them frequently. 
</P>
<P>
DeMoss, who is serving the fourth year of a five-year burglary sentence, said 
the program has helped inmates he has known stay out of prison once they get 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best thing that's ever happened out here," DeMoss said. "Everyone 
I've known who's been involved in M-2 hasn't come back." 
</P>
<P>
Graham, like Kindschi, joined M-2 after seeing a presentation by Lord. He 
visits DeMoss about three times a month, three to four hours each a time. 
</P>
<P>
DeMoss said that having an M-2 sponsor has helped him to change his opinion of 
himself and the potential for his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel like I had a chance," DeMoss said. "But I figured, if they care, 
maybe I've got a chance." 
</P>
<P>
"They're taking time out of their lives to make other lives better -- through 
companionship, through becoming friends. They don't just drop the relationship 
when he's free. We're lifetime friends now. After M-2, I'll eat out of garbage 
cans, I'll sleep under bridges before I come back to prison."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: 'MORT TELLS IT STRAIGHT' -- MAYBE HE SHOULD ZIP IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was Morton Downey Jr. night at Symphony Hall on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversation as combat, roller-derby discourse, the kind of intellectual 
point-counterpoint where one side plays its trump card by flinging rubber vomit 
onto the stage. Four-, seven- and 12-letter words fill the air. 
</P>
<P>
At center stage of this Grand Guignol is the rubber-lipped outrage himself: 
Morton Downey Jr., chain-smoker, talk-show pugilist, right-wing folk singer and 
author of the all-purpose squelch: "Zip it." With no television cameras 
present, this is the unexpurgated Downey as he debates two shills imported from 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in faded blue jeans, black tank top and a silvery jacket, he works the 
crowd like an aging rock star, slapping the hands of those in the front row, 
throwing their favorite obscenities to those in the balcony. In the lobby, 
Morton Downey Jr. sweat shirts are selling briskly. 
</P>
<P>
The night's topics are the death penalty and date rape, and the shouting and 
stomping begins even before Downey strolls to the podium, beer in hand. It is 
mostly a college crowd and, make no mistake, they love him. "Give 'em hell, 
Mort, call 'em all sleaze balls and pablum-pukers and no-good liberals." 
</P>
<P>
The same students that flee from Kant and sleep through Henry James line up to 
pay $15 a ticket to hear Morton Downey Jr. 
</P>
<P>
A generation ago, students tried to shout down one of Downey's predecessors, 
the arch-conservative Joe Pine, but that was then and this is now, and the mood 
on campus has apparently changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Mort tells it straight, man, like what a bunch of blood suckers all lawyers 
are and how most politicians are gutless and afraid to execute the killers," 
said Arthur Derry, a business administration major. "College tries to make us 
see both sides of an issue. That's B.S., and all the profs know it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All in How You Look at It 
</P>
<P>
Overheard in an elevator in downtown San Diego: 
</P>
<P>
"The boss told me I have a bad attitude, but I told him he was wrong and that, 
besides, I don't care what he thinks." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Off to a Ruffled Start 
</P>
<P>
Look, up in sky, it's a bird . . . 
</P>
<P>
The newest addition to the San Diego skyline is the fowl logo of Union Bank, 
which late last week displaced the California First Bank logo atop the latter's 
25-story building at 5th and B. 
</P>
<P>
Cal First last year bought out Union Bank but decided it liked its 
acquisition's name better than its own. The Bank of Tokyo, which owns Cal 
First, then had a new logo designed for Union Bank to reflect both the Japanese 
reverence for birds and the American respect for strength. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the new logo, described officially as a stylized blue eagle ruffling its 
stylized wings. Just why the bird is ruffling its wings is unclear. Maybe it's 
annoyed by the logo featuring three sea gulls that's on the Great American 
Building across the street. 
</P>
<P>
We prefer to see the logobird not as an eagle but as a Thunder Chicken. 
Chickens have an honorable history in San Diego's financial affairs. The San 
Diego Chicken, for example, formerly served as symbol and spokesbird for Great 
American First. 
</P>
<P>
Feathers aside, the Cal First / Union Bank switch is one more sign of San 
Diego's mixed attitude toward airborne advertising. The City Council fought all 
the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to defend its anti-billboard ordinance, then 
two years ago rejected a Planning Department suggestion to ban corporate names 
and symbols from new high-rises. 
</P>
<P>
Designs for signs and other eye-catchers for new buildings must be submitted 
for review, but changes in existing ones are exempt. Union Bank unveiled its 
new logo at midweek and had it in place and freeway-visible by Friday. This in 
a city where it can take weeks to get a permit to remodel your bathroom.

JOINT VENTURES SCRAPPED IN BID TO GAIN MORE CONTROL; 
</P>
<P>
FOREIGN FIRMS DECIDE TO GO IT ALONE IN JAPAN

<P>
Foreign companies are casting off the security of joint ventures in Japan and 
stepping out on their own to take advantage of booming consumer demand, 
marketing consultants say. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. fast-food chain operator Wendy's International and West German car maker 
Volkswagen AG are among companies that are trying to boost sales by taking 
greater control of their own marketing efforts here. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is gaining control," said William Best, manager here of consultants 
A. T. Kearney International. "They see the booming consumer market while their 
own sales languish." 
</P>
<P>
Some frustrated foreign companies are boosting their stakes in their ventures 
with Japanese partners to a majority interest while others are gearing up to go 
it alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, a joint venture is a lousy arrangement from a strategic point of 
view, because it only serves to minimize risk," said James Abegglen, president 
of consultants Asia Advisory Service. 
</P>
<P>
"Always try first to do it on your own, and fall back to joint arrangements 
only when you have to." 
</P>
<P>
Best found in a study of 2,000 companies with foreign capital here that 3% to 
5% of the foreign investors had recently upped their stakes. By the end of next 
year that could reach 15%. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, foreign firms readily set up joint ventures to penetrate Japan's 
multilayered market, often signing away exclusive distribution rights to 
trading companies or to distributors in the same or a complementary business. 
</P>
<P>
But they have had trouble getting the Japanese partner to sell their brands 
aggressively, marketing consultants said. 
</P>
<P>
Eastman Kodak subsidiary Eastman Kodak (Japan) Ltd., for example, formed 
ventures with two former distributors and one customer for hands-on control in 
the Japanese market, an Eastman Kodak Japan spokesman said. By last August it 
had secured a majority interest in all three ventures. 
</P>
<P>
"We think about what's going to happen 50 years from now," said spokesman 
Toshio Nakano. "Trading companies have slightly different objectives than 
manufacturers." 
</P>
<P>
Abegglen said a hookup may be necessary to help companies with staffing and 
distribution -- the biggest headaches foreigners face -- until the company 
outgrows the need. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. chemical company Du Pont, which has nine joint ventures here, could 
develop by relying on its partners, an official said. But the policy now is to 
concentrate new investment on its wholly owned subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
"We've built up enough of an infrastructure that now we have the luxury of 
choosing whether to put technology into our own operations or into a venture," 
said Thomas Jordan, head of planning for the subsidiary Du Pont Japan Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
"Why automatically share the profit and rewards if you have the option of 
keeping them in your own subsidiary?" he asked, stressing that Du Pont would 
consider additional joint ventures to obtain a specific skill or technology. 
</P>
<P>
Some foreign companies say a controlling interest is not enough. 
</P>
<P>
They aim to run the show by setting up a subsidiary independent of any 
exclusive licensing agreement. This would result in the subsidiary temporarily 
competing against its parent's joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
It may be awkward, but some have decided it is worth it. 
</P>
<P>
Swiss confectioner Jacobs Suchard opened a Tokyo subsidiary last month to 
create its own sales network. Toblerone and other Suchard brands have been 
imported and sold by Japanese confectioner Meiji Seika since 1971 but only in 
selected department stores and supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
"We aim to widen our market and put our candy bars in the neighborhood shops," 
a Suchard subsidiary spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Direct Network 
</P>
<P>
Suchard may also renew the contract with Meiji. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy's also expects to increase sales by creating a direct network. It has 27 
stores now under an exclusive franchising contract with supermarket giant Daiei 
via a joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
A Wendy's official said the company expects to open 15 stores within five years 
and will target the suburbs to avoid competing directly with the venture, which 
has aimed for urban areas. "We don't want to interrupt their operations," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen is also preparing for twin billing. The German car firm is 
negotiating with trading company Yanase, its sole importer and dealer in Japan, 
to allow Volkswagen to set up its own distribution network. 
</P>
<P>
The firm expects an agreement this month with Yanase, which will continue to 
import and sell Volkswagens, said Robert Janson, Volkswagen Asia Ltd executive 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen warn that the market here is still a labyrinth of personal contacts 
that can obstruct the newcomer. Kodak got around that by hiring staff from its 
former distributor. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese business is still Japanese business and relationships are still very 
valuable," Best said.

MACHINE TOOL ORDERS OFF 27% IN JANUARY

<P>
Machine tool orders fell 27.1% in January from December to $230.8 million, the 
National Machine Tool Builders' Assn. said. 
</P>
<P>
The January decline followed a 13.4% gain in December orders from November and 
points to slow growth in the economy during the month. 
</P>
<P>
Machine tools orders are an indication of capital investment by manufacturers 
of durable goods, which are items such as refrigerators and cars that last at 
least three years. The figures are often volatile from month to month. 
</P>
<P>
In its monthly statistical report, the tool industry trade association said 
Friday that total orders were down 22.4% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, domestic orders of metal-cutting tool orders totaled $145.5 
million, a drop of 24% from December's $191.5 million and a 29.3% fall from the 
previous year's total of $205.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic metal-forming tool orders fell 6% to $56.60 million from December's 
net of $60.20 million and were down 6.1% overall from year-ago figures. 
</P>
<P>
The association said the backlog of orders in January was $2.26 billion, up 
from the December backlog of $2.19 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Shipments of domestic metal cutting tools fell 52% to $89.50 million from 
December's $186.4 million. Metal forming shipments also fell to $42.20 million 
from $64.30 million, a 34.4% drop from December. 
</P>
<P>
The association said total shipments of cutting and forming machine tools fell 
47.5% last month to $131.7 million from $250.7 million in December and were up 
4.8% from the $125.6 million in shipments in January last year.

Tennessee S&amp;L Closed: Federal regulators closed insolvent Valley Federal 
Savings Bank of Dayton, Tenn., Friday, and the Federal Savings and Loan 
Insurance Corp. said it would begin a direct payment of $12.9 million to 
insured depositors. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board directed FSLIC to begin 
the payment of insured funds because a merger or an acquisition could not be 
arranged. As of Dec. 31, Valley had $11.9 million in assets, $15.7 million in 
liabilities, $12.9 million in deposits and negative regulatory capital of $3.5 
million.

No Decision by USDA: No decision has been made on how to squeeze $2 billion out 
of farm programs to meet federal spending goals, but analysts are looking at 
all possibilities, Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter said. "We'll find a 
way to do so, because that's a requirement of the (budget) process," Yeutter 
told reporters. About $2 billion will have to be whittled from programs in the 
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Those cuts were not specified in the budget 
proposals submitted by the outgoing Reagan Administration in January and were 
left open to be negotiated with Congress. Options for cutting USDA farm program 
spending include further reductions in target prices for major crops, including 
wheat, corn and cotton. Those are prices used in a formula to help determine 
federal subsidies to farmers who participate in annual crop programs.

The increase in both the current account deficit and inflation will not divert 
the Australian government from its current economic policy, according to 
Treasurer Paul Keating. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech prepared for delivery to economists, Keating said last week that he 
expected demand to moderate through 1989 and 1990 as recent tightening of 
monetary policy takes effect. "I believe we now have reached a stage of 
sufficient tightening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An unexpected $1.54-billion current account deficit in January and a 7.7% 
inflation rate for 1988 were "undoubted setbacks" but were symptomatic of 
economic growth, much of which was going into business investment, Keating 
said.

Buoyed by favorable prices, Malaysia's rubber producers last year recorded the 
biggest increase in rubber output registered during the past 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Figures published by the country's statistics department last week showed that 
Malaysian natural rubber production during 1988 was 79,343 tons, or 5%, higher 
than in 1987 at a record 1.658 million tons. Output had been stagnant at around 
1.5 million tons a year throughout the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The average price for top grade rubber sheets -- specifically RSS No. 1, the 
hedging grade -- rose by about 25% last year to $1.13 a kilogram. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the record production, Malaysian rubber exports for last year were only 
marginally higher, at 1.61 million tons, than in 1987. So stocks at the end of 
the marketing year were valued at about 5.15 billion ringgit (Malaysian 
dollars), an increase of some 1.23 billion ringgit. 
</P>
<P>
Major buyers were Singapore (205,000 tons), South Korea (167,000 tons), the 
United States (135,000 tons), China (112,000 tons), Japan (95,000 tons) and 
West Germany (95,000 tons). 
</P>
<P>
The figures show that the Far East has now overtaken the industrialized 
countries of the West as the major market for Malaysian natural rubber, a trend 
that is expected to continue.

HAWAII'S CHOCOLATE EXPERIMENT; 
</P>
<P>
COCOA COULD PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE FOR TROUBLED SUGAR GROWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Can Hershey Foods help give a Hawaiian punch to the beleaguered sugar growers 
of the Aloha State? 
</P>
<P>
The Pennsylvania candy maker has produced a test chocolate bar made from the 
first cocoa beans ever to be grown on the islands. Sugar farmers have their 
eyes on the cocoa, not the sweetener, in the five-pound Hawaiian chocolate bar 
presented to Gov. John Waihee. 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa beans might provide a viable alternative to sugar. Hammered by foreign 
competition, artificial sweeteners and depressed prices, sugar growers are hard 
pressed to diversify into new crops. 
</P>
<P>
Hershey Foods has teamed up with Kalela Enterprises to explore the agricultural 
and economic possibilities of growing cocoa beans in Hawaii. So far, their 
joint venture, known as Hawaii Cocoa, has invested about $3 million in the 2 
1/2-year-old project, which has about 400 acres under cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
The first harvest last November produced about 15,000 pounds of the beans. "We 
consider the first not worth selling. We're using it for tests," explained Jim 
Walsh, president of Hawaii Cocoa. "We sent a lot of it to Hershey." 
</P>
<P>
Hershey, which provides only technical expertise to Hawaii Cocoa, has developed 
a chocolate using the Hawaiian beans, but it does not plan to use it in its 
products. "We consider this to be very early in the experimental stage," said 
Carl Andrews, a spokesman for the company in Hershey, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii's maximum annual production of cocoa beans is projected at 15,000 tons, 
according to Andrews. That is minuscule compared to worldwide production of 2 
million tons. Hershey, the largest cocoa user in the United States, imports its 
cocoa from South America and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
For Hawaii Cocoa, the idea is to produce a specialty or novelty chocolate 
product unique to the islands. "What we're telling people is that in six 
months, we'll start seeing it in better restaurants as desserts made from 
Hawaiian chocolate," Walsh said. "In a year, it will be in better chocolate 
stores. You'll see it in L.A. in three months." 
</P>
<P>
The cocoa experiment began when Amfac, a major Hawaiian sugar producer and 
former partner in Hawaii Cocoa, began a search for crop alternatives. "Hawaii 
has a sugar problem," explained Walsh, "We have 235,000 acres in sugar, which 
is primarily supported by price supports. It is the largest agricultural 
industry in Hawaii, employs 7,000 and is endangered of going out of business in 
1991" when the price supports are lifted. 
</P>
<P>
The price supports at 21 cents a pound are running about twice as much as the 
world sugar price. "That is quite a discrepancy," he pointed out.

U.S. INSURERS GET FOOT IN THE DOOR IN S. KOREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following years of pressure by U.S. government trade negotiators, five U.S. 
life insurance companies recently received permission to enter South Korea's 
insurance market, which is worth $6 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, U.S. trade officials filed a formal complaint against the South Korean 
government and both sides have been negotiating ever since, according to Gordon 
Cloney, president of the International Insurance Council in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Four firms plan to set up joint ventures with South Korean firms. A fifth, the 
Prudential Insurance Co. of America, was allowed to set up a wholly owned 
subsidiary, according to a recent announcement by the South Korean Ministry of 
Finance. 
</P>
<P>
The four companies have chosen well-established Korean partners. Aetna 
International will be working with Dongbu Steel Co., Metropolitan Life 
Insurance with the Kolon Group, Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance with Coryo 
Securities Co. and Mutual Benefit Life Insurance with Tong Yang Cement Co. 
</P>
<P>
"The opportunities in the Pacific Rim are exciting," said Richard F. Moore, 
Prudential's vice president of international insurance. "The economy is growing 
at a tremendous rate." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said the first step is to educate the Korean people because, "in the past 
insurance was not looked upon as a need and was not even understood." 
</P>
<P>
He said Prudential plans to hire as many Koreans as possible to run the 
subsidiary. "We want it to be as much of a Korean company as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Henry E. Kates, president of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance in Newark, N.J., 
said Mutual, which will own 49% of the new Korean venture, intends to target 
the needs of Korean businesses and "upscale, affluent professionals." 
</P>
<P>
Mutual's decision to move into South Korea is the first step in a new global 
insurance marketing strategy, Kates said. 
</P>
<P>
John J. Creedon, president and chief executive of Met Life, said he was very 
pleased that the South Korean government approved the company's request to do 
business. Met Life's venture partner is the Kolon Group. 
</P>
<P>
"Met Life's reputation for providing innovative products and services will help 
to set new standards of quality and excellence for the Korean insurance 
industry," said Dong Chan Lee, chairman of the Kolon Group. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Connecticut Mutual and Aetna said the move into South Korea is 
part of on-going international marketing strategy. 
</P>
<P>
The five new companies join two U.S. firms that have been operating in Korea 
for about 20 years, according to the Insurance Council's Cloney. The American 
International Group and Cigna Worldwide were the first U.S. insurers to set up 
branches in South Korea. "The nature of the Korean economy suggests that it is 
not going to be easy for the foreign insurer," said Cloney. "It will probably 
be a business that will develop slowly and over time." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. insurance companies moving into Korea are likely to have experiences 
similar to U.S. companies in Japan. There, U.S. firms have a 3% share of the 
insurance market, representing about $200 million a year, Cloney said. He said 
the companies will not have to cope with cultural differences, but will have to 
adjust to the antiquated regulatory system governing Korea's insurance 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.'s Allstate Life Insurance unit was denied permission 
to sell policies because it failed to meet a technical requirement. However, 
the ministry official said Allstate could set up its joint venture with Samwhan 
Corp. as soon as it meets the requirement.

CASH REGISTERS DEAL ROBBER A RINGING DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A well-dressed robber who couldn't figure out how to open the cash registers at 
two fast-food outlets got smart on his third try Sunday morning and simply 
ordered a North Hollywood doughnut shop owner to hand over the money, Los 
Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
In each instance, the robber pointed what seemed to be a gun held under his 
light-blue suit and fled in a late-1970s gray or silver-blue Cadillac, police 
said. His take from the third robbery was about $70. 
</P>
<P>
The first attempt occurred shortly after 9 a.m. when the man walked into 
California Donuts in the 13300 block of Victory Boulevard in Van Nuys with a 
handgun partially hidden by his jacket, Police Sgt. Christopher Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Sopphirrith Lor ran to the back room, either to hide or escape, Vasquez 
said. The robber tried unsuccessfully to open the register and left, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'This Is a Holdup' 
</P>
<P>
About an hour later, the man went to Perry's Mexican Food in the 12500 block of 
Roscoe Boulevard in Sun Valley and said, "This is a holdup," according to owner 
Oliver Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him the money's in the register," Nichols, 61, said. "I walked back to 
the cook and told him to push the button because I have an alarm system." 
</P>
<P>
The robber looked confused when the computerized register wouldn't open, and he 
left empty-handed, Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at Fresh 'n Fancy Donuts in North Hollywood, the man walked in about 
10:40 a.m. and yelled: "Get all your money for me! I'm going kill you if you 
don't give me all your money," recalled the owner, who asked that his name not 
be used. 
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old owner handed over the money in his register -- about $70. 
</P>
<P>
He was able to jot down the license-plate number of the robber's car, which was 
parked in front of the shop on Laurel Canyon Boulevard near Roscoe Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The owner, whose first wife and two children were killed by the Khmer Rouge, 
fled Cambodia in 1975. He repaired televisions and his second wife worked as a 
waitress, saving money to buy the doughnut shop in 1982. He said the store has 
been struck by thieves about four times a year since then. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to stay in small business," he said quietly. "But I still believe 
there are a lot of good people in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Police described the robber as a white male, 35 to 40 years old, about 6 feet 
tall and 180 pounds.

BRUINS GET A REPRIEVE, WIN, 56-55; 
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON STATE, GOING FOR LAST SHOT, MISSES SHORT JUMPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Washington State had the basketball and 33 seconds in which to make up a 
one-point deficit. Harold Wright dribbled all around the perimeter, with Trevor 
Wilson shadowing him and waiting for him to make the pass to Brian Quinnett. 
But Wright worked the clock down to 2 seconds and took it to the basket himself 
for the short jump shot from the left of the key. 
</P>
<P>
In and out. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson grabbed the rebound, crashed to the floor and checked the scoreboard, to 
be sure time had run out. It had. The Bruins had escaped with a 56-55 victory 
Sunday afternoon at Pauley Pavilion before a crowd of 4,637. 
</P>
<P>
Shaking his head, Wilson said: "When a guy gets a shot like that two feet from 
the basket and it's in and out, you just count your blessings and walk away 
with the victory." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins also walk off with a record of 18-7 overall, 12-4 in the Pacific 10 
Conference. And no matter how much respect the Cougars gained with their 
effort, their record dropped to 8-17 overall, 3-13 in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the Cougars dragged the Bruins into their own slow-down style, 
forced turnovers, frustrated UCLA on both ends of the court, and wound up with 
the nothing but the satisfaction of knowing that they gave the Bruins a good 
scare. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not really a loser until you quit, and our guys never quit," Washington 
State Coach Kelvin Sampson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've been outmanned every night we go on the floor. But we were able 
to get the game at a pace where we have a chance to win. We've done that to 
UCLA twice this season, and we've lost by one point twice." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA freshman Don MacLean, playing despite a 101-degree fever that came with 
the flu he has had for the last couple of days, led the team with 19 points. He 
also sprained his left ankle with 16:07 to play. He went to the locker room to 
get it re-taped, and he returned to finish the game. 
</P>
<P>
Also coming through for the Bruins at the end was Charles Rochelin, a senior, 
who says he's aware that he's down to his last few games. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to play like I'm on fire. . . . I want to do anything I can so I 
can go out a winner." 
</P>
<P>
Rochelin played some in the first half, but it was down the stretch that he, as 
UCLA Coach Jim Harrick put it, "stepped forward and bailed us out." In the 
final minutes, he made five of seven from the field to finish with a total of 
12 points. And he had four blocked shots to finish with five. 
</P>
<P>
Rochelin scored the most inspirational points of the game, slamming down the 
rebound of a shot that Kevin Walker had missed. That put the Bruins back within 
a point, at 45-44, and brought the crowd to life. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins had been playing catch up since the opening minutes, when the 
Cougars jumped to a 6-0 lead. They trailed by as much as seven points before 
finally getting the lead at the end of the first half. UCLA led, 30-29, at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
But Washington State came right back to score on a three-pointer by Quinnett, 
who led the Cougars with 17 points. Rochelin answered with an 18-footer from 
the left side to put the Bruins back within a point. And, after a timeout, the 
Cougars demonstrated their ultimate patience when Brian Wright worked the clock 
all the way down to six seconds before hitting his three-pointer to make it 
50-46. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins were scrambling. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Wilson was sitting on the bench with four fouls. He didn't come 
back in until just 3:45 remained. 
</P>
<P>
The bench time contributed, but Wilson finished with a season low of four 
points. Point guard Pooh Richardson had a season low of five points. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson got three of those five on a key three-pointer that tied the game, 
52-52. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Delaney had made one of two free throws to give Washington State a 53-52 
lead when Mac- Lean made the 16-foot baseline jumper, the basket that Harrick 
said "put us over the top." 
</P>
<P>
When Quinnett missed and Richardson got the rebound, Richardson close to slow 
it down and work it to Rochelin for the eight-footer that gave the Bruins a 
three-point margin that held up. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick said: "Rochelin and MacLean weren't off today. We had a couple of other 
guys who were missing shots and we made some poor decision on breaks. We were 
in a hurry, instead of being quick. We made 19 turnovers ourselves against no 
pressure. We mishandled the ball and made some awful decisions." 
</P>
<P>
But they got away with it when Wright's shot popped back out. 
</P>
<P>
Sampson didn't second-guess the way the last 33 seconds were handled. As he saw 
it, how can a coach complain about a two-foot shot that gets inside the rim? 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Harrick said, he would not, for himself, choose to go for 
the last shot. He'd rather leave himself some options in case the shot didn't 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're shooting 29% from the field and you rely on one shot to win the 
game? That's something I wouldn't do." 
</P>
<P>
But when he was asked how the shot looked to him when it went up, he smiled the 
smile of a man who had just received a reprieve and said: "It looked pretty 
good to me." 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's victory was No. 350 for the Bruins in Pauley Pavilion, where they have 
a record of 350-36 (.906). . . . Washington State's 29.3% field goal percentage 
was the lowest by a UCLA opponent this season. The previous low was USC's 
37.2%. . . . With two regular-season games left and an 18-7 record, UCLA Coach 
Jim Harrick said: "I've been saying all along that I thought 18-9 would make 
the NCAA tournament. But now we're getting greedy. Now we want to win 20. . . . 
I think our league should get four teams in the tournament. I think we have 
four quality teams. " . . . Don MacLean leads the team in scoring with 18.6 
points a game; with 10 rebounds, MacLean has a total of 191, a varsity record 
for a freshman. . . . Forward Charles Rochelin's five blocked shots were a 
season high for him. . . . UCLA will play at Cal Thursday and will wrap up the 
regular season with a game against Arizona at Pauley Pavilion Saturday at 11:30 
a.m.

Last year's City of Los Angeles Marathon almost went off without a hitch. 
Bonnie Wells and Jack Slater are glad it didn't. After they finished the 26.2 
miles together, they headed for the awards stage, where they were married. 
</P>
<P>
Another runner, Margo Apostolos broke into tears when she crossed the finish 
line. It was a private triumph that few of the spectators were aware of. Months 
earlier, she had undergone a partial mastectomy, and against all advice she 
entered what would be her first marathon. 
</P>
<P>
This Sunday, the streets will fill with runners as 20,000 are expected to 
participate in the fourth edition of the race. A marathon is many things to 
many people, a set of binoculars that each runner must bring into focus for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
For some, it actually changes their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the exact date -- June 4, 1987," Apostolos said. "I was putting 
body lotion on, and I found a lump the size of a jelly bean in my left breast." 
</P>

Apostolos, who is director of dance at USC and assistant professor in the 
division of drama, said she was frightened, had a mammogram done, and got the 
bad news that it was suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
"They took cells out of the lump itself, then did a biopsy, which disclosed 
malignancy," she recalled. "On June 29 they performed a segmental mastectomy. 
In August and September, I underwent radiation treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Ever since her college days Apostolos, now 39, had been a jogger, although she 
had never tried a marathon. Now she was being told to take it easy. Her reply 
was to inform her oncologist that she intended to participate in the coming 
City of Los Angeles Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"He became quite angry. I think he wasn't sure what the effect would be, and he 
didn't want me to be a guinea pig." 
</P>
<P>
But run she did in last year's race, finishing in 5 hours and 14 minutes, and 
that night she penned a note to the doctor: 
</P>
<P>
"I told him what I had accomplished, and I explained that perhaps he didn't 
understand the psychological implications of wanting to compete, and working 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
"What all of it did was help me overcome the psychological aspects of the 
illness. People who knew me were begging me not to run the race -- they feared 
something terrible would happen to me. But I had made up my mind in advance 
that if I reached a point where I felt ill, I would drop out." 
</P>
<P>
That never happened. "And completing a marathon isn't something you can fake," 
Apostolos said. "To me it was a test of internal strength and will." 
</P>
<P>
After last year, she went on to participate in the Chicago marathon in October, 
improving her time to 3:52. Apostolos is currently running 80 miles a week to 
train for Sunday's race here. 
</P>
<P>
"Both times last year, after I had finished, I broke into tears. People came 
over thinking I had hurt myself. I told them to go away; it was a very private 
moment for me. It was the realization of what I had overcome." 
</P>
<P>
Her doctor plans to hang on his office wall a photo of her competing in 
Chicago. "I don't think doctors will be prescribing marathons for patients such 
as me," she said, "but I believe they will think twice about telling people not 
to run in them. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very positive about life now." 
</P>
<P>
Running in last year's marathon here, a bridal veil in her hair, Bonnie Wells 
couldn't help breaking into a grin when she heard a spectator shout: 
</P>
<P>
"Gee, my wife would never have run that far for me!" 
</P>
<P>
Ten months earlier, Wells and Jack Slater, both of Hampton, Ill., had met 
through a running club. They agreed that since that had been the case, it would 
be proper that their wedding should involve their hobby. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided on a marathon, saw that the time of year of the Los Angeles 
Marathon was perfect, and got permission from the officials for our plans," 
Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
The bride had run in the St. Louis Marathon, but this was the first one for the 
bridegroom. "We had given some thought to my wearing a tuxedo and she running 
in an upper gown," he said, "but we concluded that being comfortable would be 
more important." 
</P>
<P>
Side by side they proceeded. Other participants, having heard about the couple, 
offered congratulations while running by. One man strode alongside from about 
mile 20 to 24, announcing to spectators: "Here they are!" 
</P>
<P>
"At about 13 miles, Bonnie injured her left ankle," the bridegroom disclosed, 
"but she couldn't stop. We had a wedding ahead of us." 
</P>
<P>
After 4 hours and 15 minutes, the couple crossed the finish line. "Bonnie went 
to the Sports Arena, where a hairdresser was waiting to do her hair," the 
bridegroom said. 
</P>
<P>
Then the couple walked onto the awards stage, where a judge was preparing to 
officiate. It was a touching ceremony. Both the bride and bridegroom wore 
shorts. 
</P>
<P>
They honeymooned in Palm Springs, where Bonnie spent three days with her 
injured ankle wrapped in ice. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a year later, the 39-year-old Slaters are still happily married. She is an 
investment secretary, he is a production and inventory control manager. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie and Jack won't make it back for this year's renewal, but -- as their W-2 
Form will prove -- their lives were indeed changed as a result of last year's 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
There is at least one man whose life was rescued as a result of watching last 
year's marathon. This time he will be in it, and you'll recognize him by the 
wording on his tank top: "Serious About Sobriety." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Zepeda of La Habra had a good job as a firefighter when it began -- the 
cocaine usage and alcohol abuse. "When they found out about it, my bosses gave 
me a lot of chances," he said, "but when you are in a state of denial, nothing 
matters -- not your job, not your wife, not anything. 
</P>
<P>
"After eight years of it, I had hit bottom. I was unemployed, I was 
unemployable. I honestly believe my next stop would have been Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
"I was alone in my apartment (his wife was in a hospital). The booze and the 
drugs had become so much of a priority that the house payments became 
delinquent and I lost the place. I had been on a binge, and now I was feeling 
depressed. I switched on the TV and there was the marathon in progress. I began 
crying. Everybody looked so healthy and happy, and here my life was the pits. I 
remembered that I used to enjoy running. I had done many 10-Ks. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a commitment then and there to try to turn my life around." 
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old Zepeda said he joined a "12-step program," and at first 
attended meetings three times a day, such was the extent of his problems. 
</P>
<P>
He took up running again, shook off drugs and alcohol, and got his weight down 
to 165 pounds from the 220 pounds to which he had bloated. 
</P>
<P>
"Running in the marathon will be my way of celebrating the fact that I have 
been clean and sober for an entire year now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A trouble of a different kind had tormented 63-year-old Ed Roman for years -- a 
chronic back ailment. Then he discovered running. a "I had been going to a 
chiropractor for a long time," said Roman, a legal assistant. "Several years 
ago, when I mentioned that I was thinking of taking up running, he strongly 
advised against it. He said the pounding my feet would withstand would cause my 
back to misalign." 
</P>
<P>
But Roman, who lives in Los Angeles, began doing 10-Ks and found he was none 
the worse for wear. He also learned that, at least in his case, the running -- 
plus exercising properly -- left him with a pain-free back. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of adopted what the chiropractor had been doing -- I learned how to 
crack my back myself," Roman explained. "I get up at 4 a.m. every day. I wait 
about 20 minutes, and then I lie on my back on the floor. I cross my left arm 
over my chest, then I raise my right leg and go toward the left, which creates 
a twisting motion. I also reverse the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing takes about 15 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Roman said he hasn't been to a chiropractor in four years. Not only that, but 
his running has graduated to marathons. He has finished in each of the first 
three here (even though last year's took him about six hours), and he expects 
to join the throng this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I have three sons," Robert H. Goldman said from Springfield, Ill. "Rick and I 
had been the furthest apart. 
</P>
<P>
"When his mother and I divorced when he was 17, he went to live with her in 
Baltimore. He and I went our separate ways. I remarried, and he also married. 
Our contact was very light -- over the years we saw each other only a few 
times." 
</P>
<P>
The City of Los Angeles Marathon changed all that. 
</P>
<P>
"In May of 1987, Rick came to visit me," the father said. "I was going to run 
in a 10-K in a few days. I had been running for years to keep in condition -- I 
had even started entering marathons -- but he had never been much for sports." 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the son ask to give it a try in that 10-K in Monticello, but he 
liked it so much he took up running. 
</P>
<P>
"That December he phoned and said he wanted to try a marathon," said the 
60-year-old Goldman, a state labor investigator. "By then he had moved to 
Glendale, and I told him that if he could get ready, we would run together in 
the one coming up in Los Angeles. He got a book and trained by the book." 
</P>
<P>
And last year father and son ran in it together, the younger Goldman finishing 
in 4:10, the older in 4:44. 
</P>
<P>
"Running has finally brought us together," said Rick, 35, a recording studio 
mastering engineer. "As a child, I was into music and he was into sports -- we 
were going in two different directions." 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that we had no common bond. Our contacts were perfunctory-type, 
just because he was my son and I was his father," the elder Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we phone each other at least once a week. Among other things, we discuss 
our training programs for various races."

FOR WOMEN IN THE MEDIA, THE PICTURE IS STILL GLOOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
There was the long view, which was upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
And there was the short view, which was depressing. 
</P>
<P>
At a weekend conference at USC on "Women, Men and Media: An Update," the short 
view was most pervasive. 
</P>
<P>
Whether speaking of the number of women who lead newsrooms, head networks or 
direct films, the majority of participants at Saturday's conference on the 
progress of women in the news and entertainment industries weighed in on the 
gloomy side, offering evidence that women either are caught in a holding 
pattern or actually losing ground in the battle for equal time and jobs in the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
Chaired by "Feminine Mystique" author Betty Friedan, a visiting professor at 
USC's School of Journalism and Institute for the Study of Women and Men, the 
second-annual, daylong conference sought to move beyond the generally grim 
numbers of women employed in power positions to such broader issues as whether 
a return to traditional sex roles -- called "retro-feminism" in one recent 
magazine cover story -- is hindering women's careers, and whether the women who 
are in decision-making roles are making a difference. 
</P>
<P>
And, in most respects, its message was just as glum as it was last year. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sara Davidson, creator of "Heartbeat," an ABC-TV series about a feminist 
health clinic: "We haven't reached the critical mass to see what kind of 
difference we could make." 
</P>
<P>
The buzzword of the day seemed to be "plateau." Again and again, panelists said 
that after years of steady progress, the gains in employment made by women in 
media jobs seem to have flattened out. 
</P>
<P>
Citing figures compiled by the Federal Communications Commission on the number 
of women broadcast professionals, Kathy Bonk, who headed the Women's Media 
Project of NOW's Legal Defense and Education Fund, said: "We're not going 
backwards. We've just plateaued out." 
</P>
<P>
According to Bonk, who now co-directs a Washington-D.C.-based communications 
consortium, the number of women in jobs such as news writer and television 
anchor nearly tripled during the Nixon, Ford and Carter Administrations. But 
during the Reagan presidency, she said, "there was only a 3% gain." 
</P>
<P>
Katherine Coker, past chairwoman of the women's committee of the Writers Guild 
of America West, said female writers in 1985 earned 70 cents for every $1 that 
their male counterparts made, a decrease from 1982 when women writers earned 73 
cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Woodhull, president of Gannett News Service, told the audience -- a 
predominantly female gathering of 240 journalism students, working journalists, 
screenwriters, academics, entertainment industry publicists and others -- that 
the picture was only "a smidgen better" for women on newspaper staffs. In 1989, 
women represented just under 14% of the editors, executive editors, managing 
editors and city editors nationally, an increase of less than 1% over last 
year's figures. 
</P>
<P>
Women may be backsliding, she suggested, relating the story of a woman who 
recently was promoted to news vice president in a major media company, taking 
over the job of a man who had been a member of the company's influential 
executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
"She was not named to the executive committee," but felt she could not 
complain, Woodhull said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's that kind of thing (that's going on). It's true you can't rock the boat 
when you're not in it. But when you're sitting precariously on the edge, it's 
very, very tough" to rock it without falling off. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Huck, a Los Angeles-based correspondent for Newsweek, asked the panelists 
how women are coping, given such discouraging signals. 
</P>
<P>
Coker of the Writers Guild said women are hanging in because dropping out of 
the work force is not an economically feasible alternative. But they are under 
"enormous stress . . . (which is) growing all the time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Arlie Hochschild, a UC Berkeley sociologist who has studied issues related to 
women and work, said many women she has interviewed are so overwhelmed by the 
responsibilities of career and home and so afraid of pressuring their husbands 
to share the burden that they are "dropping out within, repressing their 
ambitions." 
</P>
<P>
"They are afraid because marriage has become extremely fragile," Hochschild 
said, "and they're afraid because of what happens economically to women" after 
a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Ingley, business editor of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, said she 
has noticed more women succumbing to what she has called "voluntary plateauing" 
-- women who have the opportunity to rise in their careers but choose not to 
because of family obligations and personal priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"They are older, have children. They say, 'I don't want to give my life over to 
the newspaper,' " Ingley said. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures compiled by Jean Gaddy Wilson of the University of 
Missouri School of Journalism, which were released at the conference, women 
currently comprise 36% of the employees in radio, television and newspapers. 
But at the top ranks, barely 6.5% of the publishers of daily newspapers and 
less than 5.5% of the editors-in-chief were female. Women accounted for 6.1% of 
all television news presidents, vice presidents and general managers, less than 
a one-half percent increase since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wilson found that less than 15% of the network news stories 
broadcast in 1986 were filed by female correspondents. And, of the 4,684 
directors registered with the Directors Guild of America in 1986, 8%, or 384, 
were women. However, female directors garnered 24% of the nominations for 
Directors Guild awards. 
</P>
<P>
Gannett executive Woodhull said women have not yet learned how to "empower" 
other women. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not working together," she said. "We compete against one another. The 
only ones who can break the cycle are women themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Loring, president of MGM Television, which produces the hit yuppie drama 
"thirtysomething" among others, said that although she got her first big break 
from a man, "I feel a definite responsibility to help women." In particular, 
she said, she has made a concerted effort to spot talented women in the 
secretarial ranks to help "make the jump" into creative positions, such as 
writers and story editors. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson, who was a novelist and nonfiction author before trying her hand at 
television drama, raised the hackles of several in the audience when she said 
that she had a rough time finding many women writers qualified to write for 
"Heartbeat." And, she added, in terms of women directors, she frequently was 
asked to consider women who had little experience who came to her hoping for 
their first big break. But, harkening back to the 
"can't-rock-the-boat-if-you're-sitting-on-its-edge" principle, she said, "You 
cannot give a woman her first shot if you're trying to get on the air 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
One of this season's exceptions to the male-dominated show is "China Beach," 
about a MASH unit in Vietnam, which features an ensemble cast with several 
strong female characters. Co-creator John Sacret Young said the story editors 
are all women, the cast is more than 50% female, and more scripts are written 
by women than by men. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if that's because we're different or strange," he said, to which 
a couple of the women panelists sharing the stage with him during the afternoon 
session jokingly responded, "Both." 
</P>
<P>
Friedan ended the conference, which was sponsored by Women in Film and USC's 
School of Journalism and Institute for the Study of Women and Men, with a plea 
to form a national media monitoring group that could apply pressure to news and 
entertainment businesses to improve their hiring and portrayal of women. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few optimistic notes sounded all day came from Hochschild, the UC 
Berkeley professor, who encouraged women to consider the long-term progress 
they have made. Despite ominous soundings from various sectors that a new 
traditionalism is gripping young women and sending them away from careers and 
back into the home, Hochschild said: "In the long term, I'm perhaps not as 
depressed as everyone here." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, most of the conference's speakers voiced an impatience with the rate of 
changes -- and an urgency to quicken the pace so that they might reap the 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
As CBS News' Siebens put it, "We can wait for our children to grow up and be 
hip CEOs, but by then we'll all be dead."

FIRST LADY TRAVELS IN HER OWN STYLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
George and Barbara Bush like to be down home and personal, even here and even 
though their roles have lifted them to a far worldlier status. 
</P>
<P>
On Bush's first presidential overseas trip, the couple chatted with their old 
barber and the widow of the man who used to drive them around when they lived 
here 14 years ago. They hosted a dinner that featured barbecue flown in from 
Houston and served on red-and-white checked tablecloths by Chinese waiters 
wearing blue jeans, red bandannas and Western-style blue-and-white checked 
shirts. Their ceremonial gifts included cowboy boots made in Texas for Deng 
Xiaoping and a Jack Nicklaus putter (the one with that huge 6-inch blade) for 
Korean President Roh Tae Woo, a golf enthusiast. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the responsibility for preserving their social style falls to Mrs. 
Bush, who emerged on the trip as someone who relishes interacting with people 
on a one-to-one basis and who resents the restrictions that come along with 
being First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush doesn't like having to worry about every little thing she says and 
every move she makes. When the trip began in Japan, she backtracked on a 
statement she'd made weeks ago supporting a ban on AK-47 assault rifles and 
authorized her spokeswoman to tell the press that she would never again comment 
on controversial issues because her husband's opinions were the ones that 
mattered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shoving Matches 
</P>
<P>
In China, Mrs. Bush's visit to the Forbidden City turned ugly when poor 
planning resulted in shoving matches between American press and Chinese 
security as throngs of people attempted to accompany her on her tour and 
hundreds of Chinese looked on in puzzlement. In a throne room called the Hall 
of Supreme Harmony, White House photographer Carol Powers was pushed into a 
door and sustained a dislocated jaw, reducing her to tears. 
</P>
<P>
"She works for my husband," Mrs. Bush said ominously to her Chinese guide, 
asking him to "calm down" the Chinese security forces. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush warned other photographers among her entourage of 100 guards, aides 
and media to be careful taking her picture, calling out, "I don't want to worry 
about you like I'm your mother." 
</P>
<P>
(Powers, 35, was later reported to be feeling better. And hours afterward, 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reportedly confirmed that he and Powers 
were engaged.) 
</P>
<P>
Normally the office of the First Lady sends an advance team ahead to the 
various sites she will visit and plans all the logistics to virtually every 
step. But Mrs. Bush so cherishes spontaneity that she did not send an advance 
team, allowing the U.S. Embassy to make suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter asked if her trip had been "just a little lightly advanced," 
she replied tersely, "You're just saying that to be rude because you know I 
don't want to be advanced. . . . I was reminded that when Betty Ford came here 
she was enormously advanced and the exact same thing happened. This is going to 
happen. That's just life." 
</P>
<P>
She added very emphatically, "That's the way I want it." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush showed herself to be the genuine article, a woman who pulls no verbal 
punches and refuses to be scripted. It often served her well on the trip, as 
when she walked into a tea at a restored 200-year-old mansion and kissed and 
hugged Sara Thomas and Huang Zhen, two old friends from China. She talked with 
each of the 33 women guests, smiling, raising her eyebrows and asking them 
questions about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
She joked about her age at the Forbidden City, referring to a banquet that had 
once been held there for Chinese citizens over 60. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my group, my crowd," she told her Chinese tour guide, museum director 
Yang Xin. "I would have come to the dinner." 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, she was the perfect diplomat at her meeting in Tokyo with Mexican 
First Lady Cecilia Occeli de Salinas, making small talk about Mexican 
revolutionary war hero Emiliano Zapata and assuring Magdalenia Acosta, the wife 
of the Mexican ambassador to Japan, that her English was "very good, very 
good," placing her hand affectionately on her knee. She found time to buy 
Japanese paper dolls to bring back to her grandchildren and embroidered 
lipstick cases for her staff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Light, Airy Schedule 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to be a warm First Lady and keep a low profile at the same time, Mrs. 
Bush kept her foreign schedule light and airy, including personal interactions 
with leaders' wives and sentimental touring. She planned no separate public 
events during the 5-hour stopover in Seoul today. 
</P>
<P>
But even with the time restrictions, her actions on this first overseas trip 
suggested a profile of a First Lady who sees her role as supporting but never 
overshadowing her husband and trying above all never to cause him embarrassment 
with comments that come forth too quickly or delve too deeply. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush answered only a few questions from the press, talking mostly about 
how much she was enjoying her visit in China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Feel Good About China' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm loving it, really loving it," she said in a courtyard of the Forbidden 
City. "I feel good about China. I'm not good about telling my feelings. We went 
to church today. We saw the ministers we saw every Sunday when we lived here. 
This was a very happy time in our life. I feel lucky to be able to be back 
here." 
</P>
<P>
It was a sentiment she freely showed in her exploration of favorite sites. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush greeted a familiar bronze statue of a kneeling elephant near the 
palace's rear door with a cry of delight: "That's my Republican elephant." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think it's good luck to touch it?" she asked Yang Xin. 
</P>
<P>
When he nodded with a smile, she reached out and stroked the tusk. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she would be visiting China again, Mrs. Bush replied, "If he'll let 
me," referring to her husband.

Unusually hot weather for February raised temperatures into the mid- to high 
80s in Orange County on Sunday. The thermometer rose to 85 in Santa Ana, tying 
a record high for the date set in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
Cooler temperatures are predicted today and through the rest of the week, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's unseasonably warm temperatures even toasted some beach communities. 
The high in San Clemente was 82, according to WeatherData Inc., which provides 
weather information for The Times. In San Juan Capistrano, the temperature on 
Sunday soared to a summery 88. 
</P>
<P>
The balmy weather prompted thousands of people to flock to Orange County 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington State Beach drew about 10,000 people Sunday, according to Lifeguard 
Richard Rozzelle. "On a normal Sunday in February we'd get about 2,000 people 
max," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty warm for February, and the sun felt very, very nice. I was lying 
out in the sun myself during the morning." 
</P>
<P>
In Newport Beach, runners entering the early-morning Spirit Run 5-kilometer and 
10-kilometer races at Fashion Island found themselves perspiring under the warm 
sun even before the races began. Normally runners can expect cool early-morning 
winter temperatures in Orange County -- especially in February. 
</P>
<P>
But according to WeatherData, Orange County had something like "July in 
February" over the entire weekend. "The high temperature in Santa Ana was 86 on 
Saturday," said Rick Dittman, a meteorologist with WeatherData. 
</P>
<P>
Dittman said mild Santa Ana winds flowed in over the weekend, spawned by a high 
pressure area over Nevada. Those warm winds, he said, added to a weather 
situation that already positioned Orange County for a balmy weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a high pressure system in the upper levels, over Mexico, and a low 
pressure out in the Pacific," Dittman said. "That just helped create the fair 
weather over the last several days." 
</P>
<P>
Dittman said the high temperatures are predicted to slide back into the 70s 
locally today. "I don't think we'll have any more temperatures in the 80s for 
quite a while," he said. "The forecast calls for unsettled weather the rest of 
the week, with a chance of showers by mid-week."

SECOND-CHANCE SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
WESTERN STATE MAKES ITS CASE FOR LAW STUDENTS SHUT OUT OF TOP COLLEGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Finishing up a solid academic career at the University of Wisconsin a few years 
ago, Ron Bethia Jr. had big plans: graduation, law school, perhaps a law 
practice and politics. 
</P>
<P>
Then came disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Never a good test-taker, Bethia did miserably on his law school admissions 
test. And, he recalls, "I was crushed. I thought I was doomed." Indeed, most 
law schools wouldn't look at him, citing his test scores. 
</P>
<P>
But then Bethia heard about Western State University College of Law, a law 
school not accredited by the American Bar Assn. but well regarded in California 
as a "second-chance school" for non-traditional law candidates: generally older 
students, many of them at mid-career and often lacking the grades or test 
scores to get them into Establishment law schools with more rigid requirements. 
</P>
<P>
It is also the biggest law school in California and one of the biggest in the 
nation, with 1,600 students and campuses in Fullerton and San Diego. The school 
is accredited by the state, and its graduates are eligible to take the 
California Bar examination and practice law in California. And, in fact, the 
school has produced scores of judges, prosecutors and other public officials in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last few years, Western State has undergone an identity crisis of 
sorts -- centering on the school's academic mission in relation to such 
students as Ron Bethia. Only now, under the direction of a new president, has 
that uncertainty passed. 
</P>
<P>
"We perceive ourselves now -- and I think rightly so -- as a local school, here 
to serve students in Southern California," said John C. Monks, who took over as 
Western State president last summer after leaving his job as an administrator 
at Northeastern University law school in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Rebuffed in attempts to join the ranks of the established, national law schools 
accredited by the ABA, Western State has redefined its goals and, in the most 
dramatic step in that process, abandoned its lengthy and costly quest to gain 
ABA accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
"I know a lot of people here were reluctant to close the book on" seeking ABA 
accreditation, said Monks, who took over as Western State president partly with 
the understanding that the school would end its frustrating ABA hunt. 
</P>
<P>
"But we decided just not to pursue it -- we realized it was crazy, just banging 
our heads up against a wall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a divisive time, one that has taken its toll on school morale and 
has focused on the question of what best indicates success in the legal field. 
And only now has the debate reached a resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a Harvard or a Yale or a Stanford," Monks says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Returning to Its Roots 
</P>
<P>
The difference now, however, is that Western State has decided to forgo 
whatever hopes it once held of achieving a lofty national name and, instead, 
return to its roots of educating students who, as Dean of Admissions Joel H. 
Goodman said, "might not otherwise have the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Added Associate Prof. Neil T. Gotanda, who holds degrees from Harvard, Stanford 
and Berkeley and is among a recent influx of faculty with impressive 
credentials: "The school has picked its path. It's not going to be an ABA 
school." 
</P>
<P>
"We're satisfied serving the students we do and being clearly -- without doubt 
-- the best of the non-ABA schools and on par with some of the smaller ABAs." 
</P>
<P>
The school spent several years and millions of dollars to upgrade its 
facilities and standards in hopes of gaining accreditation from the American 
Bar Assn., only to be rejected by the ABA in May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The ABA does not disclose publicly its review of accreditation candidates, but 
Western State officials said the rejection was based largely on a lack of 
proper facilities -- such as library space and volumes -- and the need to raise 
some of its academic standards. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond those concrete concerns is the feeling among many in the Western 
State community -- denied by ABA officials -- that the school was hurt in the 
bid for accreditation by its unique status as a for-profit institution, founded 
23 years ago by a handful of investors. 
</P>
<P>
Western State does not release financial information, but a rough tabulation of 
the school's student population and tuition -- $254 per credit hour (more than 
what most public schools charge but less than tuition at private schools) -- 
would generate yearly revenue estimated at $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For-Profit Status 
</P>
<P>
For years, the ABA refused to consider law schools that were operated for 
profit, of which Western State is considered the largest. That rule was 
recently changed, but President Monks said the school's for-profit status "is 
obviously not in the mainstream thinking, and that may have posed obstacles" in 
the eyes of the law school Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
In practical terms, accreditation would have allowed Western State's graduates 
to take the bar and practice law anywhere in the country, instead of being 
limited to California and a few other states. But just as important, the ABA 
accreditation would have meant a boost in status and respect. 
</P>
<P>
"As a faculty member, I'd have liked the prestige," admitted Prof. Marcia B. 
Wilbur, faculty dean. "And the students wouldn't be denied the flexibility" of 
practicing law in other states, she added. 
</P>
<P>
And so, though Wilbur and other school officials point to Western State's 
unique niche in the law school community, the school's failure to gain ABA 
accreditation -- and its decision not to pursue that course in the future -- 
comes only with a price. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph Hasl, dean of the St. Louis University School of Law and chairman of 
the ABA's accreditation committee, would not discuss details of his panel's 
Western State review but maintained that, in general, accreditation is not 
merely a sign of prestige. "It reflects a seriousness toward the educational 
mission," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Hasl contended, non-ABA schools must face "a presumption of 
non-competence. . . . (Their students) are just not getting the same kind of 
preparation." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing that view was a top administrator at a major California law school, who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity. He said: "The academic pecking order is 
one that values high LSAT scores and prestigious faculty and (schools that) 
send their students to the top law firms making the top salaries. And if you 
take a look at Western State, there's no mystery where they stand." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lower LSAT Scores 
</P>
<P>
By numbers alone, Western State seems to fall short of most of the 
approximately 175 ABA-accredited schools nationwide. With a median LSAT score 
of 30 (out of a possible 48), Western State students rate on par with a few 
schools at the bottom of the ABA spectrum, Goodman said. And its first-time bar 
passage rate of about 50% also falls significantly below most ABA schools. 
</P>
<P>
But Western State officials maintain that, for their students in particular, 
traditional academic indicators such as LSAT scores and grade-point averages 
are not good measures of legal success. 
</P>
<P>
That is because many of the school's students -- with an average age of 33 -- 
are seeking out law school after having had experience in other fields. A full 
10% of the school's students have worked in law enforcement, for instance, 
while about 5% were nurses and 2.5% were doctors, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. Duncan L. Hunter (R-Coronado), a 1976 Western State graduate, gives 
his own case as an example. Returning from Vietnam, Hunter wanted to go to law 
school but had not finished his college degree. He heard about Western State 
and was not disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great experience studying with older people who had some real-life 
experience in the world and learning from professors who were practicing judges 
and lawyers -- not some guys who hadn't set foot in a classroom in years," 
Hunter said. "It was a place of opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Western State's graduates also include state Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego), 
Assembly Minority Leader Ross Johnson (R-La Habra), Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter 
and Tustin Mayor Ursula E. Kennedy, as well as several dozen prominent judges, 
bar officials and prosecutors in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Employment Rate 
</P>
<P>
School officials concede that Western State's lack of national accreditation 
generally precludes its students from gaining high-paying jobs in the biggest 
and most prestigious law firms. But they point to a 98% employment rate among 
recent graduates -- including an increasing number at large law firms -- as one 
sign that students do well nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll do fine, I know we will," said 27-year-old Maria Larrea, who said she 
did poorly on the LSAT but is studying at Western State under a special 
academic support group that offers extensive counseling and tutorial work to 
several dozen borderline students each semester. "We're going to prove all 
these fancy law schools and big firms wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Although most at Western State say they would have liked the school to be 
accredited by the ABA, many contend that accreditation might have changed the 
school's atmosphere for the worse -- cutting out less qualified students who 
are now given their only real chance to practice law short of signing up at 
completely unaccredited and suspect "diploma mills." 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown, an adjunct professor at Western State, 
said, "Sure, I was disappointed when the ABA didn't come through, but I think 
now that we would have lost that very special flavor of the student body." 
</P>
<P>
Added President Monks: "Others can knock us, but we can take a great deal of 
pride in teaching people for whom success is not a foregone conclusion -- who 
have to work a little bit harder."

IN A BIG DAY FOR CHASES, NINE HELD, NONE HURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Three times Sunday, police in hot pursuit raced after suspects on Orange County 
streets and freeways, in one case dodging bullets as well as traffic. The 
long-distance chases ended with all nine suspects under arrest, without 
injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In the first pursuit, which began at 2:34 a.m. in Anaheim, shots were fired at 
police, authorities said. The suspects were caught in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
In the second chase, which began at 3 a.m. on West Coast Highway in Newport 
Beach, police captured three young men in an allegedly stolen truck after they 
roared through Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, Garden Grove and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The third police chase began about 3:30 p.m. on the San Diego Freeway in Irvine 
and ended without incident near Carson in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officer Spotted Car 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim chase began during the dark, early-morning hours when an officer in 
a residential area near Ball Road spotted a 1984 BMW sedan that had been 
reported stolen in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The officer tried to stop the car, but the driver sped away and the chase 
began, Anaheim Police Sgt. Ed Pierson said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim officers were assisted by Buena Park police and the Los Angeles 
Sheriff's Department as they chased the car west on the Artesia Freeway into 
Artesia. The suspects were caught after their car went off the road in a 
residential area and they tried to run away, Anaheim Sgt. David Severson said. 
</P>
<P>
During the chase, one or more of the car's occupants fired shots at the 
pursuing officers but missed, Pierson said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police arrested Jose Luis Gomez, 20, of Norwalk, a 16-year-old and two 
15-year-old youths, Pierson said, all on suspicion of robbery, kidnaping, 
assault with a deadly weapon and grand theft auto. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the allegedly stolen car was forcibly moved before the chase 
began, resulting in the kidnaping charge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About half an hour after the Anaheim chase began, police in Newport Beach 
became involved in a 40-minute chase of an allegedly stolen truck through four 
cities. Three young suspects were finally arrested when the truck was forced to 
stop at a dead end in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt in the Newport chase, but the truck at one point hit a 
6-foot-tall, wrought-iron gate and dragged it, sparks flying, for several 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suspects Identified 
</P>
<P>
Officers identified those arrested after the chase as Mark A. Denhamer, 20, and 
Won Young Jung, 19, both of Downey, and a 16-year-old Norwalk youth, who was 
not identified. Police said the youth was the driver of the truck. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Tim Riley said a Newport Beach officer tried to stop the truck on West 
Coast Highway about 3 a.m. after he saw it speeding and being driven 
erratically. The driver, however, sped off into Huntington Beach, Riley said, 
and passengers in the truck threw articles of clothing and papers from the 
truck toward pursuing police. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit continued into Garden Grove and ended in Santa Ana where Trask 
Avenue dead-ends at the Santa Ana River, Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
He said all three people in the truck, which was allegedly stolen in Los 
Angeles County, were booked on suspicion of grand theft auto. 
</P>
<P>
In the third chase, Irvine police said they were alerted about 3:30 p.m. to the 
theft of irrigation pipes from Irvine Co. farmland off Sand Canyon Avenue. 
Police Sgt. Steve Frew said an Irvine Co. security guard notified police that a 
truck had roared off with the pipes, and headed north on the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Followed to L.A. County 
</P>
<P>
Frew said Irvine police found the truck a short time later as it moved north on 
the freeway; they followed it into Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
When the truck exited the freeway in the Carson area, Irvine police stopped the 
vehicle and arrested two men inside, Frew said. 
</P>
<P>
They were identified as brothers Richard C. Neumann, 24, of Huntington Beach 
and James T. Neumann, 27, of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
James Neumann was having breathing difficulties when arrested and was taken to 
Harbor General Hospital in Torrance for treatment and observation, Frew said. 
His brother was brought back to Orange County after being arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Both are suspected of possessing stolen property and of evading police, Frew 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists who try to escape police are few in number, according to law 
enforcement officials. Frew said there are several reasons, however, why some 
people in cars think they can elude officers who signal them to pull over. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reasons for Fleeing 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's because the drivers are so intoxicated they don't really know 
what they're doing," he said. "Sometimes it's because people think all they 
have to do is get physically out of sight -- that police don't have their 
license number or description. And we've had people who've told us that they 
thought if they could just get back to their own driveways, police couldn't 
touch them -- that it was King's X (safety). 
</P>
<P>
"There are really many reasons. I guess we could make a million dollars if we 
could figure out the mind of a criminal. But I think a basic reason (people try 
to flee police) is just lack of common sense."

GIRL, 11, AMONG SIX KILLED IN GANG VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By GEORGE RAMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 11-year-old girl was killed and her aunt was critically wounded in the 
Pico-Union area west of downtown Los Angeles when they were struck by gunfire 
apparently intended for gang members standing nearby, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The death of Jasmine Guevara Saturday night was one of six gang-related 
homicides recorded over the weekend in Los Angeles County, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said the girl, her 14-year-old sister, Melda, and aunt Blanca 
Guevara, 42, were going home from a liquor store where they had bought candy 
and soda when several shotgun blasts were fired at 9:30 p.m. in front of an 
apartment house in the 1800 block of Orchard Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The gunfire came from a passing auto, perhaps a Camaro. Melda Guevara was not 
wounded but several pellets hit Jasmine Guevara and her aunt, investigators 
said. The girl was pronounced dead at the scene. Her aunt was was reported in 
critical condition at County USC-Medical Center on Sunday with neck wounds, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The motive for the shooting is in all likelihood the usual gang retribution 
drive-by shooting and the victims were innocent victims," police Lt. Rob 
Watters said, adding that there were no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I thought it was firecrackers," said Melda. "Then I looked down and 
I saw my aunt lying on top of my sister. I didn't want to believe my sister was 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors, who heard the gunfire, rushed outside and found Melda screaming at 
her dead sister, "Don't die! don't die!" 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen pellets crashed into the downstairs apartment of Jose and Maria 
Vedal, who were watching television. Bullet fragments damaged kitchen furniture 
and shattered a mirror in the living room. "Luckily, we were all on the floor 
and none of us got hit," Jose Vedal said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shooting at Gas Station 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, a 16-year-old suspected gang member was fatally shot Saturday night 
as he stood next to his car in a gasoline station at Florence Avenue and 
Figueroa Street in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Stacey Koon said Jesus Gutierrez was shot just before 9 p.m. by a gunman 
believed to be a member of a rival street gang. Gutierrez died two hours later 
at an Inglewood hospital. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
Gunshots were fired in a fight between two rival gangs on a San Pedro street 
corner at about 11:15 p.m. Saturday, killing Ronald Rand, 28, of Long Beach, 
investigators said. Rand was not believed to have been a gang member, but his 
companions were, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Sergio Gutierrez, 28, was in critical condition after being stabbed by gang 
members at a party early Saturday at Treasure Island Park in Downey, police 
said. A 15-year-old boy was arrested in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Two other suspected gang members, Luis Chavez, 21, and Jose Leon, 18, were 
killed in separate incidents Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez was run over by a car and killed as he tried to run away from a fight 
that broke out in Bell, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Leon was killed and two others were wounded in a drive-by shooting in 
South-Central Los Angeles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In another incident with gang overtones, a man was killed Sunday after two 
robbery suspects led police on a high-speed chase and then slammed head-on into 
the victim's car. 
</P>
<P>
Killed in the collision at 49th Street and Broadway was Carlos Diaz, 24, of Los 
Angeles, police said. The driver of the car being pursued, Anthony Francisco, 
22, was booked on suspicion of murder in the jail ward at County-USC Medical 
Center, where he was in serious condition. His associate escaped. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy (Diaz) was totally innocent," Sgt. David Young said. "And then, with 
him lying there, the paramedics cut the suspect's (Francisco) shirt off to 
treat him and there were his gang insignias." 
</P>
<P>
Young said officers had tried to stop Francisco's car on Normandie Avenue after 
a license check showed the car had been used in a recent robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Late Sunday, LAPD officers arrested four men and two teen-age boys, all 
believed to be gang members, on suspicion of attempted murder in the shooting 
of a woman at the Chevy Chase Park Recreation Center in the Atwater area. 
</P>
<P>
Lillian Montanez, 56, of Los Angeles, the mother of 10 children, was hit in the 
wrist and was treated at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Paul Herman said the woman confronted the suspects, who were creating a 
disturbance at the center, and asked them to leave. They returned later and 
shot her, he said.

A fire attributed to transients or children caused $20,000 in damage to an 
unoccupied house Sunday night, Santa Ana fire officials said.

<P>
The blaze at 5404 W. 4th St. was reported at 6:21 p.m. and brought under 
control about 10 minutes later, Battalion Chief Jess Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I say the damage was about $20,000, I mean to the structure itself, 
because the house was abandoned," Hernandez said. "There was just trash inside 
the house." 
</P>
<P>
While the cause of the fire is unknown and under investigation, Hernandez said 
that "it was probably started by transients or kids." 
</P>
<P>
The fire erupted in a rear room of the single-story, single-family home, 
Hernandez said. The blaze did not spread to any other structures, and no 
injuries were reported.

MILITARY EXERCISES BOOST NOISE AT EL TORO

<P>
Residents near the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station may experience an increase 
in noise, base officials said, because of regional military exercises that 
began Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The additional noise is expected to last through Tuesday morning because of 
extended operating hours for the base, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The airfield will operate from 3 a.m. to 8 p.m. today and until 9 p.m. Tuesday.

NOTEBOOK: 'QUAYLE TRAIL' WAS BUMPY ROAD FOR PRESIDENTIAL ADVISERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA LUTHER, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year or so ago, when top presidential advisers Ken Khachigian and Stu Spencer 
met at Tommy's Family Restaurant in San Clemente to jaw about politics, they 
came to this conclusion: It might be a kick to campaign with a vice 
presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'You know, actually, Stu, it might be more fun if we traveled with the 
vice presidential candidate. More independence. You get to be on the attack all 
the time because that's the function you fulfill,' " Khachigian recalled while 
speaking the other day to the Republican Associates of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But neither Spencer nor Khachigian -- who ended up traveling with Dan Quayle -- 
figured that the campaign would be quite so bumpy. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to be 6-foot-3 and have black hair," the several inches shorter and 
much more gray Khachigian joked of what he called the "Quayle trail." 
</P>
<P>
Khachigian, a former speech writer for President Reagan and a close adviser to 
Gov. George Deukmejian, and Spencer, whose counsel has been sought by top 
Republicans from Nixon to Reagan, were Quayle's "handlers" during the 
tumultuous fall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Khachigian, 44, of San Clemente gave a wry account of the campaign that 
succeeded in spite of itself. He said he first met Quayle about a week after 
the Republican convention in New Orleans when Bush literally plucked the 
youthful Indiana senator out of a crowd on the river front and, in a stunning 
announcement, said he had selected Quayle for the other half of the GOP ticket. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically all he did was show up," Khachigian said. "No one told him what to 
say or suggested to him how to comport himself. . . . So while I think it was a 
clever, creative idea that might have worked with somebody who had been 
experienced in national politics at that level, it was sort of uncomfortable 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle's speech, instead of establishing him as a credible national candidate, 
was better suited to a county central committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But things quickly got worse in the next few days as questions were raised 
about Quayle's military service record in the National Guard, his grade-point 
average in college and the method used to get him admitted to law school. 
</P>
<P>
"He started out behind the eight-ball," Khachigian said. On the campaign trail, 
Quayle continued to fuel the controversy over his credentials by making 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"At one press conference, very early in campaign, seems to me in Montana, he 
was asked out of the blue what his feelings were about the Holocaust," 
Khachigian said. "It was the last question he expected. And he said, 'Well, 
that was a tragic period in American history.' Of course, everybody knows -- 
they knew, we knew -- that he meant world history. Then there was a follow-up 
question to that, and he said, 'As you know, I wasn't born in this century.' 
"It's one of these things, how can you take back words that you say?" 
Khachigian asked. "There are people for whom the words sort of come out faster 
than they intend." 
</P>
<P>
As a national candidate, Quayle's offhand remarks stuck with him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's repeated over and over again, and Newsweek puts it in that little quote 
compilation every week . . . and then the other side starts using it and pretty 
soon they've got this list of quotes," Khachigian said. "Well, we do it to the 
other side. And they did it to us." 
</P>
<P>
There were other snafus, some of which Khachigian blamed on the campaign staff. 
On one occasion, Quayle was due to make a major speech on foreign policy and 
national security. A speech was written by Khachigian with input from Quayle. 
But Quayle wanted to, as Khachigian said, "wing it." 
</P>
<P>
The trouble was the text of the speech already had been distributed to the 
national press corps. When Quayle started speaking off the cuff, reporters were 
thrown. They started frantically taking notes and rushed to phones to cancel 
earlier stories they had filed, awaiting what they supposed would be only minor 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
"So they were outraged," Khachigian said. "That was really a sad mistake. And 
we really disserved the candidate that day." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Khachigian said, the speech, "which I thought was not a bad 
speech" was generally described as pretty awful. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bush-Quayle ticket won, after all. Khachigian said there were even many 
good moments on the Quayle trail and a few laughs. "So we did have some fun," 
Khachigian said. But, he added, "We didn't make much national attention unless 
there was a problem."

<P>
A solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the sun and Earth, briefly 
blocking part or all of the sun's light. A partial eclipse will occur on the 
morning of March 7 and will be visible in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
As seen from Los Angeles, the eclipse will begin at 8:55 a.m. and end at 10:47 
a.m. At maximum, which occurs at 9:50 a.m., 36% of the sun's image will be 
obscured by the moon, according to the Griffith Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
Because this is a partial eclipse, the sky will not darken noticeably, but the 
right equipment can provide a better look at this rare phenomenon. Griffith 
Observatory will be open from 8:30 a.m. until noon on March 7 so that the 
public can view the eclipse through the observatory's solar telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
Do not look directly at the sun during the partial eclipse, because such 
exposure can damage the eyes.

People with Alzheimer's disease show abnormal nerve fibers in the nose, a 
finding that may lead to a diagnostic test and a new avenue of research for 
finding a treatment, a study suggests. Nasal nerve tissue can be removed under 
local anesthetic, which may offer a way to study the brain disease early in its 
course, said researcher Barbara Talamo, director of the neurosciences program 
at Tufts Medical School in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
That could lead to the first definitive test for diagnosing Alzheimer's in a 
living patient and allow studies of the disease in living nerve tissue, 
possibly giving hints for treatment, she said. Alzheimer's experts familiar 
with the research are skeptical about prospects for a diagnostic test, but they 
agree that studying the nerve tissue may be useful. 
</P>
<P>
She described the new research in the British journal Nature with colleagues 
there and scientists from Harvard Medical School and the University of 
Pennsylvania Medical School. The new study focused on nerves found at the top 
of the nose within the inner lining, where they are responsible for detecting 
odors. The nerves extend threadlike projections into a portion of the brain 
that is affected by Alzheimer's disease, Talamo said.

WHALES FEW AT FESTIVAL, BUT WHO NOTICED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OK, so there weren't many whales at the 17th annual Festival of the Whales at 
Dana Point Harbor on Sunday. People were just having too good a time to notice. 
</P>
<P>
The festival is held each year to mark the whale-watching season as the big 
California grays migrate from the Bering Sea off Alaska to lagoons near the tip 
of Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
But family events planned by the Orange County Marine Institute to promote 
interest in the California gray whale were just a bonus to most of the 
thousands who gravitated to Dana Point Harbor for the weekend. The real charmer 
was the weather. 
</P>
<P>
Sunlight glistened on the waters of Capistrano Bay as thousands converged on 
the harbor for a picture-postcard array of seashore activities. 
</P>
<P>
Some combed through the gift shop and museum of the institute, some climbed 
onto the famous brig Pilgrim, docked near the museum's door. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Absolutely Nothing 
</P>
<P>
But Roger Monell, a computer salesman from Laguna Hills, sat on a boulder on 
the seaward side of the harbor wall, rested his head on the palms of his 
interwined hands, and did what he had waited to do all week -- absolutely 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in heavy traffic all week. I love to come here just to think," Monell 
said. "You don't get many days like this in February." 
</P>
<P>
Francis and Kazuko Nishioka of Yorba Linda were baiting their hooks with ghost 
shrimp in efforts to catch snapper and halibut. Fishing would be useless until 
after 5 p.m., when the tide would change, Francis Nishioka explained. Then why 
fish in the middle of the day? 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a beautiful day, why not?" he said smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Morgan of Laguna Niguel had much better luck with his catch. His bucket 
was teeming with small crabs caught in small pools of water between the rocks. 
Morgan, 8, said the keys were having plenty of experience and using anchovies 
as bait. 
</P>
<P>
Two Marine lance corporals from Camp Pendleton, Dennis Roggenkamp and Jerry 
Burns, braved the cold waters for snorkeling near the sea wall. 
</P>
<P>
"You can snorkel plenty of places up and down the coast. But there's no place 
more beautiful than Dana Point," Burns explained. 
</P>
<P>
Like most who dotted the landscape, the two Marines had no idea there was a 
festival going on. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Paul Ott said he didn't blame them. 
</P>
<P>
Ott was center of attention at the festival Sunday. His paintings of gray 
whales were everywhere. He even designed the whale scene on the official 
festival T-shirts. Ott also spent an hour talking to a crowd about the 
migration of the gray whales. But he admitted it was too nice a day to be 
inside listening to a lecture: He couldn't wait to head for the beach himself. 
</P>
<P>
Those he entertained, however, seemed to be in no hurry to go outside. For 30 
minutes after his lecture a crowd was still gathered around him trying to learn 
more about whales and Ott's interest in wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Ott, a biologist and sculptor who lives in Laguna Beach, makes his living from 
his wildlife paintings and from taking tour groups to Baja -- both by sea and 
by road -- to view the whales' final spring destination. 
</P>
<P>
It's no surprise to Ott that people go out on whale-watching expeditions 
without seeing any whales. 
</P>
<P>
"The whales are migrating further and further away from shore each year," Ott 
said. He explained that whale watchers are driving them out to sea. While there 
are nearly 30,000 gray whales who make the annual migration, only a few 
thousand at a time are in movement along Southern California's coast. 
</P>
<P>
"On weekends, there literally are more people out in boats looking for whales 
than there are whales," he said. "The noise pollution from the motors is 
driving the whales away." 
</P>
<P>
Ott is not only an expert whale-watcher, he is an environmentalist, who uses 
his lectures to preach his views a little. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year, a million people move to within 50 miles of the coast," he told 
his audience. "Think about the pollution that creates, and it's effect on our 
sea life." 
</P>
<P>
The institute is more than just a gift shop and a lecture hall. It also has 
live exhibits which fascinate young and old: sea urchins, California spiny 
lobsters, sea cucumbers -- the animal, not the plant -- and even a horned shark 
small enough to fit into a shoe box. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Fontes, who watches over the tank where kids are allowed to touch sea 
animals like starfish and cucumbers, said it is easy to recall the most-asked 
question: "Are these things alive?" 
</P>
<P>
Betty Elder, who gives occasional whale lectures at the Marine Institute and 
also runs its gallery, says the question she gets most often is: Will the 
whales eat you? 
</P>
<P>
Not a chance, she explains to a group of children. In fact, they don't eat much 
of anything except when feeding in the Arctic waters. 
</P>
<P>
The institute does not conduct whale-watching except on Saturdays. At nearby 
Dana Wharf Sportfishing, however, officials reported Sunday's whale-watching at 
50% -- meaning that half the tour boats that went out spotted some California 
grays.

MISSION VIEJO'S JOE-MAX MOORE PLAYS HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THE REST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER , Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe-Max Moore of Mission Viejo High School is one of the best soccer players in 
Orange County. But Moore, a senior midfielder, would be difficult to pick out 
on the practice field for those who don't know him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's that kid over there with thick thighs corded with muscle, reminiscent of 
Pele, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 No. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, is he that guy, the fast one?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, no. 
</P>
<P>
Think of the quintessential Southern California kid brother, too young to 
drive, standing at the bus stop, body board in tow, waiting to catch a bus to 
catch some waves. 
</P>
<P>
That's Moore. 
</P>
<P>
He is not exactly scrawny, but to call him compact would give him credit for 
more brawn than he actually possesses. 
</P>
<P>
But the 5-foot-7, 130-pound Moore is definitely a keeper who gives goalkeepers 
fits. His 24 goals and 10 assists have helped the Mission Viejo soccer team 
advance to the Southern Section 3-A semifinals for the first time. Mission 
Viejo (23-1-3) plays host to St. Francis (17-1-1) at 3 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He really is small, but in the two years he has been playing here, he has 
never been hurt," Mission Viejo Coach Cal Foster said. "He's like a rubber 
ball. He just bounces right back up off the ground and keeps playing." 
</P>
<P>
He said Moore is the best player he has seen in his three seasons as the 
Diablos' coach. He and many of his colleagues see Moore -- the South Coast 
League player of the year this season -- as "one of the few players around who 
could go to a Division I college and start despite his size." 
</P>
<P>
And he does not compensate for his stature with blazing speed. 
</P>
<P>
Moore is fast, but at least five of his teammates at Mission Viejo are faster. 
What sets him head and shoulders above bigger competition is his knowledge of 
the game, Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
"His skills are extraordinary," Foster said. "The way he can control a ball, 
his traps, his moves with it, the way he dribbles, his touch on the shot . . . 
he knows what other people are going to do. He is thinking two to three moves 
ahead." 
</P>
<P>
His lack of size does not faze Moore. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't affect my game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"High school people try to take you down a lot more, but I don't really feel I 
get knocked around or off the ball that much." 
</P>
<P>
Others agree. Southern Methodist University and UCLA, to name a couple of 
schools, are recruiting him. And he has been the starting center midfielder for 
two seasons on the Western Regional 18 1/2-and-under team, a squad of 20 elite 
athletes selected from 14 Western states. He has traveled to Brazil with 
another all-star team three times, and spent three months on his own playing in 
Yugoslavia. He plays club soccer for the North Huntington Beach Untouchables. 
</P>
<P>
While his size has never been a problem on the soccer field, it has been cause 
for pause off it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been pulled over twice by police thinking I wasn't old enough to drive," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
His equanimity about his size comes from his dad, Carl -- a former triple A 
baseball catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Carl was a 5-foot-4, 123-pound wrestler his senior year in high school. By the 
time he was 19, he had grown 6 inches and gained 50 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"For this boy to have kept up with all the big boys while being way behind in 
(physical) maturation is unbelievable," Carl said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always just told him that one day everyone will be the same again. If you 
were fast as a little boy, you will be fast as an adult," Carl said. "Some of 
these kids grow up a little earlier than others." 
</P>
<P>
Said Joe-Max: "I don't even shave yet, but I know I'm going to get bigger. 
That's for sure. My dad's 5-10 and I'll be bigger than he is." 
</P>
<P>
Moore did most of his growing up in Tulsa, Okla., where he tried several 
sports. He was a state wrestling champion at 39 pounds in second grade, Moore 
said. "It's big there. As soon as you get to a certain weight in Oklahoma, you 
start wrestling," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
But he did not like it. 
</P>
<P>
He played a little football, but he was too small. 
</P>
<P>
He took a swing at T-ball and was a star, said his mother, Corey. That 
developed into a stint with baseball before high school, but he eventually gave 
that up because the season conflicted with soccer. 
</P>
<P>
"He picked up the soccer ball when he was 3 years old and never has put it 
down," his mother said. "He chose soccer. You pick up something when you're 
really young like these Olympic players do, and if you just live with it, that 
becomes the thing you excel in." 
</P>
<P>
"This kid was scoring six goals a game when he was a little boy," Carl Moore 
said. "When he had to make a choice to play one or the other, he chose soccer." 
</P>
<P>
Said Joe-Max: "I like (soccer) more than all the other games I've played. It's 
the most popular sport in the world, so it has got to be fun." 
</P>
<P>
Soccer is one of the main reasons his two biggest fans, his parents, moved his 
freshman year to California, where the weather accommodates soccer year-round. 
</P>
<P>
He started for Woodbridge's varsity soccer team his freshman and sophomore 
seasons. Woodbridge advanced to the quarterfinals in the playoffs his sophomore 
season, but lost key players to graduation for his junior season. 
</P>
<P>
Moore knew Mission Viejo's midfielder, Andy Wortrich, from club soccer 
competition between his sophomore and juniors years. Wortrich told Moore that 
Mission Viejo was going to have a good soccer team, so Moore moved into Mission 
Viejo's district. 
</P>
<P>
The move has been good for Moore and the Diablos, who also qualified for the 
playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing great about soccer is it's a team sport and they have all blended 
together as a team," Foster said. "There is no bickering or arguing among them. 
. . . When it comes to goal scoring, there is nobody who is selfish. They don't 
care who scores just as long as the team scores." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 16 field players, 15 have scored. Wortrich, who is 5-feet-5 and second 
in scoring with 13 goals and 14 assists, was surprised that Moore showed up at 
tryouts, but he welcomed him. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he was a good player and had some of the best skills I had seen, and he 
was as small as I was so we had something in common." 
</P>
<P>
Moore not only fit right in with his teammates, but he has adopted the 
California life style. He even catches some waves in San Clemente in his spare 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"He came from Oklahoma, but he's from Southern California now," Wortrich said. 
</P>
<P>
And his size? Well, his parents have had doctors test him for his growth 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a lot more growing to do," his dad said. "He is going to be a lot 
bigger boy than anybody could imagine, and when that happens, the rest of the 
soccer world has a problem." 
</P>

VETERAN COACH MEISS TAKES OVER FOOTBALL PROGRAM AT ORANGE HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Meiss said Sunday that he has been named the new football coach at Orange 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
Meiss succeeds Mark McMahon, who resigned after finishing 2-8 overall and 1-4 
in the Pacific Coast League last season. 
</P>
<P>
Meiss, who has been coaching for 26 years, said he will keep his teaching 
position at Santa Ana High and will be a walk-on coach at Orange. Meiss becomes 
the first walk-on head varsity football coach in Orange County since Mike 
Giddings was at Newport Harbor from 1982 to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Meiss was last a head coach from 1978 to 1983 at Santa Ana, when he led the 
team to Century League championships in 1979 and 1983 and an overall record of 
46-23-2. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Meiss assisted at Saddleback College, then became an assistant 
under Santa Ana Coach Dick Hill in 1987 and 1988. STEVE LOWERY

SWEET SOUL BRINGS ON A SUGAR HIGH FROM THE '70S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A diet of all sweets is no way to eat, and it's not the way to listen to soul 
music either. 
</P>
<P>
The menu Friday night at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim had a distinct 
early-'70s flavor: That's when the three groups on the bill -- the Stylistics, 
the Dramatics and the Chi-Lites -- had the hits that keep their fans coming 
back. 
</P>
<P>
The show treated a near-capacity house to a predominantly confectionary taste: 
the Stylistics and the Chi-Lites depended almost exclusively on their falsetto 
lead singers; only the Dramatics offered a rounded, satisfying sound that drew 
from all the basic nutritional groups of male soul singing, from a grainy 
baritone to a creamy tenor falsetto. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet sorrow was the emotional savor of the Chi-Lites' 45-minute opening set. 
With his plaintive falsetto sounding sturdier than it did on the group's hit 
recordings, lead singer Eugene Record was well-equipped to deliver as much 
melancholy as the audience could stand. By mixing tears with the sugar in his 
voice, Record kept thing interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Once a quartet, now a trio, the Chicago-based Chi-Lites opened with the main 
course: "Oh Girl," a bit of lovely melancholia that was a No. 1 hit in 1972. 
The song's ache (which was enhanced by wistful tootling on a melodica) was 
repeated on a number of other ballads. All of them worked well, but they pretty 
much seconded (and thirded and fourthed) that opening emotion from "Oh Girl." 
</P>
<P>
The Chi-Lites tried to change the pace with some antic dancing and slapstick 
moves. Some of it was entertaining, some merely corny. They would have been 
better off just singing their most effective pace changer and showstopper, 
"(For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People," but the political-funk 
workout was left unplayed. The Chi-Lites' set was compromised throughout by 
intrusively plangent sounds from snare drum and cymbals. 
</P>
<P>
The headlining Stylistics also performed as a trio, down from the original 
five. It might as well have been a solo show by Russell Thompkins Jr., the lead 
singer. Thompkins' falsetto was a marvel -- soaring, reedy, operatic and 
inexhaustible. But for all that, it wasn't an especially endearing voice. 
Almost an hour of it without rest was far too much of a good thing. But judging 
from the shaky results the few times Airrion Love and Herb Murrell took over 
lead vocals, Thompkins' dominance was a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
The Stylistics' set was so heavy on the sweet Philadelphia-soul ballads that it 
quickly became cloying (although it was undeniably a pleasure to hear Thompkins 
take portions of "You Make Me Feel Brand New" into the stratosphere). It didn't 
help that the trio's idea of a lively change of pace was a rendition of Rick 
Astley's tepid "Never Gonna Give You Up." 
</P>
<P>
The stage presentation was annoyingly slick (including astrological 
self-introductions by the three singers: "My name is Russell Thompkins, and I'm 
the Aries of the group."). An expert, well-drilled backing band helped maintain 
as high an energy level as the material would permit. 
</P>
<P>
The Dramatics' zestful set made one wonder about the Detroit group's place in 
pop history had it been blessed with Grade A material. The five-voice harmonies 
featured backup singers interlocking in classic Temptations style behind 
compelling lead singers. Ron Banks provided an assured, effortless falsetto 
that carried some bite, while L.J. Reynolds shook some mighty baritone grit 
from his compact body. Lenny Mayes provided flexibility, spelling the two main 
soloists with some nice leads of his own. 
</P>
<P>
The Dramatics offered rich ballads, including "In the Rain" and a good, 
rhythmic version of "Bridge Over Troubled Water." They balanced the balladry 
with a bit of funk -- notably the rousing set closer, "Get Up and Get Down." 
</P>
<P>
With a sharp, energetic band, some nice dance steps and a sense of camaraderie 
on stage, the Dramatics, as far as performance goes, had more to offer than the 
Temptations did in their recent show at the Celebrity Theatre. But while the 
Temptations, and all the other A-list soul vocal groups, have archives full of 
wonderful songs, the Dramatics' best material is merely good. That, in the eyes 
of pop history, makes all the difference.

STILL BEAT;

<P>
ALLEN GINSBERG'S POETRY, SONGS REMAIN ANTI-AUTHORITARIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Still anti-authoritarian after all these years, Beat-movement luminary Allen 
Ginsberg opened his appearance Friday at Cal State Fullerton with an a cappella 
rendition of his "CIA Dope Calypso." 
</P>
<P>
The humorous ditty -- to the tune of "Kingston Town" -- chronicles decades of 
alleged U.S. involvement in worldwide drug trafficking, ending with a 
recounting of the Reagan/Bush era: "They couldn't sell Congress, so the Contras 
sold cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
Ginsberg -- dressed conservatively in a dark jacket and tie, his once-lengthy 
beard now neatly trimmed -- battled a crackling sound system and constant 
rumbling from a next-door bowling alley to regale a capacity crowd at the 
University Center Pub with his poetry and song. 
</P>
<P>
The poet, now 62, was, along with "On the Road" author Jack Kerouac, one of the 
central figures of the bohemian Beat movement, which rebeled against the 
corruption and materialism they saw in post-World War II America. Ginsberg's 
now-classic 1956 poem "Howl" is one of the central statements of the movement, 
which set the stage for the rock 'n' roll-led rebellion of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Ginsberg went from "CIA Dope Calypso" to a sound poem titled "Whom 
Bomb?" and on to another song, "Do the Meditation" (which includes the line "I 
fought the dharma and the dharma won"). Ginsberg said his practice of 
"psychedelic meditation" has supplanted his use of drugs, but still he 
chastised the government for driving "educational drugs" -- namely marijuana 
and LSD -- out of the marketplace, where they have been replaced by speed, 
heroin and crack. 
</P>
<P>
Ginsberg then launched a chronological reading of selected poems, interspersed 
with occasional songs. The poet told the university crowd that he wanted to 
start with older poems "that you're more familiar with from the Norton 
Anthology." 
</P>
<P>
Starting with "Pull My Daisy" (1948), which he wrote with fellow Beat 
generation icons Kerouac and Neal Cassady, Ginsberg moved through such works as 
"The Archetype Poem" (1950), "A Crazy Spiritual" (1952) and "A Strange New 
Cottage in Berkeley," "A Supermarket in California" and "Sunflower Sutra," all 
from 1955. 
</P>
<P>
But he skipped his most celebrated work, "Howl," and instead read fragments 
from his 1960 poem "Kaddish," a moving account of his mother's long confinement 
in a mental institution. "I'd rather introduce those who are familiar with the 
flash to the shadow underneath," Ginsberg explained. 
</P>
<P>
Themes of physical decay and of mortality continued in later poems, including 
recent works from the 1988 collection "White Shrouds" and several 
as-yet-unpublished works. In "Airplane Blues," based loosely on Robert 
Johnson's classic "Love in Vain" (which the Rolling Stones popularized), 
Ginsberg sang: "The sun's not eternal; that's why there's the blues." 
</P>
<P>
In "The Guest," a bemused Ginsberg detailed a homosexual encounter with a young 
admirer, comparing his lover's taut, youthful body with his own sagging flesh. 
("This is pre-AIDS, incidentally," he told the audience Friday.) 
</P>
<P>
Figures from his bohemian past haunt much of the recent poetry Ginsberg read 
Friday, especially in poems based on actual dreams. In "I Went to the Movie of 
Life" (1987), the poet encounters figures from his past while wandering the 
Mississippi Delta at night -- Neal Cassady, old lovers, even members of the 
prototypal '60s San Francisco acid-rock band Quicksilver Messenger Service. 
</P>
<P>
"Wily wrinkled wanderers," Ginsberg called them in the poem: "Profound American 
dreamers -- I was in their company again." Yet, later in the same poem, "I 
wanted to meet someone new." 
</P>
<P>
Ginsberg told of (but didn't read) a recent poem about Kerouac, who died in 
1969. Kerouac visited his fellow '50s traveler in a dream to praise a talk he 
had given ("The first thing he had approved of in years," Ginsberg said.). 
</P>
<P>
A reading of the unpublished "Written in My Dream by William Carlos Williams" 
led to an impromptu lecture by Ginsberg on his fellow New Jersey native, whose 
use of vernacular and vivid description were a great influence on Ginsberg and 
other Beat poets. Ginsberg recited Williams' "Red Wheelbarrow" from memory and 
read his "To Elsie," which was included in the 30th anniversary edition of 
"Howl." 
</P>
<P>
Ginsberg read from a series of short poems collectively titled "Don't Grow 
Old," largely anecdotal works written in 1976 after the death of his father, 
poet Louis Ginsberg. He closed the reading about 10:30 p.m. with a final song, 
"Father Death Blues."

LAGUNA MUSEUM EXHIBIT IS NOT QUITE 'FULL SPECTRUM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Cathy Curtis 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last weekend, at the College Art Assn. conference in San Francisco, I ran into 
an old friend from graduate school who said wearily, "I never send my students 
to museums anymore. You can learn everything you want to know about art from 
slides." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't likely that many people would agree with him. Looking at the actual 
object created by an artist gives you a tangible appreciation of the way the 
artist handles materials, not to speak of a true sense of scale and depth and 
color. 
</P>
<P>
But in an era of soaring art prices, museums are increasingly hard put to 
acquire the works they need to fill the historical gaps in their collections. 
</P>
<P>
That dilemma is apparent at the Laguna Art Museum, which is displaying selected 
works from its collection through March 5. There, museum officials have never 
had a big money tree to shake for acquisitions. A glance at the labels on the 
art tells the story: Take away all the donations and the walls would be almost 
bare. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's "war chest," as director Charles Demarais calls it, now totals 
$73,976 -- about enough to buy, say, a single Edward Ruscha painting. The 
Contemporary Collectors Council has put together another $8,000. And these days 
the Historical Collectors Council is using its funds to conserve the paintings 
already in the collection rather than buying more. 
</P>
<P>
Money is a sticking point, and potential donors are not necessarily likely to 
give the museum what its heart desires. So Bolton Colburn, the curator of 
collections, has had to do some fancy dancing to try to come up with a show 
that sketches in the history of Southern California art. (Despite occasional 
detours to the Bay Area, the show utterly fails even as a "skeletal" view -- in 
Colburn's words -- of California art history.) 
</P>
<P>
"The Full Spectrum" begins on the lower level of the museum, with 19th-Century 
landscapes by newcomers to California who were awed by purple-mountain 
majesties and other natural wonders great and small. Many of these paintings 
are part of a single 1974 gift from the Carl S. Dentzel estate. 
</P>
<P>
The self-taught painters of the early days are represented by Mary Bailey's 
simple, matter-of-fact view of a wooded campsite from 1840. (Someday, it might 
be appropriate to acquire at least one painting that memorializes the Spanish 
heritage of California's other early settlers.) Then come the academy-trained 
East Coast visitors. In his dryly descriptive style, Thomas Hill picks out a 
bear motionless on a log amid fallen timbers in Yosemite. Three nondescript 
William Keiths are lined up on one wall like the Three Bears -- tiny, bigger, 
biggest. 
</P>
<P>
After this, the deluge: canvas after canvas by the so-called California 
Impressionists and their somewhat bolder followers, the plein air painters. The 
usual suspects are here -- Guy Rose, William Wendt, Edgar Payne, Franz 
Bischoff, Elmer Wachtel, George Gardner Symons, Jean Mannheim, Hanson Puthuff 
-- doing their thing with bright color and bouncy brush strokes in honor of 
spring and sunlight and flowers and hills and trees. 
</P>
<P>
However derivative and bland most of these works are, the group as a whole 
illustrates the values held dear by painters in a particular time and place. 
History is not only made of great moments. But the offerings get stingier just 
at the point when California art really began to give the rest of the world a 
run for its money. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1930s and '40s, Lorser Feitelson, his wife Helen Lundeberg, Karl 
Benjamin and the Dynaton group (Lee Mullican, Gordon Onslow Ford and others) 
were key figures in progressive Southern California painting. 
</P>
<P>
But the museum's holdings either skip over these artists entirely (no Dynaton 
folks at all) or consist of their work from later years, albeit in such fine 
examples as Feitelson's "Magical Space Forms" from 1953 (in which oddly shaped, 
brightly colored flat forms poke toward the center of the painting) and 
Lundeberg's "Sundown Shadow" from 1983, which literally pauses at the threshold 
separating realism from abstraction. 
</P>
<P>
The collection is also deficient in strong work from the '50s and '60s, when 
Southern California art really started on its roll. From these years, the most 
significant (albeit wildly different) pieces are "No. 4," a sober canvas by the 
Los Angeles master of geometric abstraction, John McLaughlin, and DeWain 
Valentine's 1964 insouciant "Pink Top." 
</P>
<P>
That piece is one of very few sculptures on view, and one suspects the problem 
is lack of inventory rather than lack of space. (The importance of video, 
"light and space" and installation art in Southern California is also 
impossible to discern from this show.) But the absence of photographs comes as 
a surprise, given the museum's ownership of vintage images by Paul Outerbridge 
and a number of good contemporary examples in this medium. 
</P>
<P>
Smart picks from the past two decades include pieces by John McCracken, Ed 
Ruscha, Jay Phillips, Allan McCollum and Jud Fine, but the show reflects 
virtually no consciousness of the steeper slopes of conceptual or postmodern 
art. Not a single recent work on view could seriously be called adventurous or 
difficult -- including the latest acquisition, Roland Reiss' "Thrower" from 
1987, a mockingly Brancusi-style sculpture of a beefy arm grasping a football. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the modern and contemporary works include some valid curiosities, like 
a painting of three violinists by David Park (later to become one of the Bay 
Area's foremost artists). But considering the wonderful things that were 
happening in Southern California art, too much wall space has been given over 
to indifferent work, mostly by artists who happen to have lived in Laguna 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Judged by its collection, the curse of provincialism still haunts the Laguna 
Art Museum. Figuring out how to charm important works out of the hands of 
private collectors is sure to be a major task in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Full Spectrum" remains on view through March 5 at the Laguna Art Museum, 
307 Cliff Drive, Laguna Beach. Gallery hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday 
through Sunday. Admission is $2 general, $1 for students and seniors. 
Information: (714) 494-6531.

MISTRIAL POSSIBLE IN NIGHT STALKER CASE OVER ATTORNEY'S EXHAUSTION

The attorney for Night Stalker defendant Richard Ramirez is suffering from 
trial-related nervous exhaustion, the judge reported today, prompting the 
prosecutor to warn of a possible mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably the chances of a mistrial are good," Deputy District Atty. P. Philip 
Halpin told reporters. "We can't keep this jury hanging around indefinitely." 
</P>
<P>
A doctor's report submitted to the judge said that attorney Daniel Hernandez is 
suffering from stress-related nervous exhaustion resulting from his 
participation in the long-delayed trial. The doctor recommended psychological 
counseling and said recovery could take six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan said he will hold hearings before he decides 
on a remedy for the situation. He ordered Hernandez and his former co-counsel, 
Arturo Hernandez, no relation, to be in court Wednesday for an inquiry on the 
state of Hernandez's health and the trial's future.

TOWER'S PLEDGE LEAVES 2 SENATORS UNMOVED

<P>
John Tower's pledge to swear off alcohol if approved as defense secretary left 
two undecided Senate Democrats unmoved today and pledging they will go over all 
evidence on the nominee's character before deciding how to vote. 
</P>
<P>
A third Democratic senator considered by some a swing vote, Bob Graham of 
Florida, said he is leaning against the nomination despite Tower's pledge. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it (the pledge) helps, but it's not just the drinking which is a 
problem to me," Graham said in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pattern of bad judgment -- bad judgment in the 1970s in drinking, bad 
judgment by placing himself in compromising positions as the U.S. arms 
negotiator in Geneva in the mid-80s, bad judgment in accepting large sums from 
the defense industry in the late 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Howell Heflin of Alabama, one of several Southern Democrats still 
considered open to the White House lobbying effort for Tower, said on ABC's 
"Good Morning America" that he has "to review all the evidence. I'm trying to 
be open-minded, judicial and fair about it." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.) said on the same program that he would vote against 
Tower if the vote were today despite the embattled nominee's extraordinary 
public pledge on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that if we have a serious doubt, if any senator has a serious doubt 
about the competence of a candidate, that he should err on the side of safety," 
said Breaux. "In that case, it indicates voting negatively." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Tower's promise to refrain from drinking had swayed him, Heflin 
said he plans to read the classified FBI report on Tower today and "will review 
the evidence of the drinking problem." 
</P>
<P>
Heflin said he will consider "does he have a drinking problem that might be a 
detriment to the United States national security" and "does he have a 
temptation propensity that might return to drink?"

A 59-year-old woman was killed today when her car was crushed by a 
lumber-carrying trailer truck that tipped over, Los Angeles police said. The 
7:39 a.m. accident at Devonshire Street and Topanga Canyon Boulevard in 
Chatsworth closed the intersection for more than two hours. Police identified 
the victim as Ella Gormley of Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
Gormley's car was stopped in a westbound lane on Devonshire waiting to turn 
south, officials said. When a tractor truck pulling two trailers of lumber 
north on Topanga Canyon Boulevard turned east on Devonshire the cab and the 
first trailer tipped over. The trailer landed directly on top of Gormley's car, 
killing her. The truck driver, Angelo Bazza, 25, of Petaluma, was not charged 
pending investigation on whether the trailer was overloaded.

Hungary, in an unprecedented attack by one East Bloc state against another, 
today demanded that the U.N. Commission on Human Rights investigate violations 
of basic freedoms in neighboring Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Gyula Horn, Hungarian state secretary for foreign affairs, delivered the demand 
at the commission's annual meeting. Horn specifically denounced the repression 
of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Romania and a wholesale destruction of 
villages to facilitate a forced industrialization program ordered by Romanian 
leader Nicolae Ceausescu. Budapest backs a Swedish proposal that the U.N. human 
rights body appoint someone to investigate Romania, he said.

A former Pasadena, Calif., man who lived in a $49-a-week room at the YMCA and 
spent as little as $6 a day on food died with $249,746 in eight banks across 
the country and no apparent heirs. 
</P>

Thomas Drummond's room had no bathroom, and he bought three $1.99 breakfasts 
each morning, saving two of them in a knapsack for later meals, acquaintances 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond, 77, died Jan. 28 in Sparrow Hospital. Unless relatives are found, his 
money will go to Michigan's general fund, said Paul Rosenbaum, the 
state-appointed lawyer handling the estate. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbaum said Drummond, a former bank employee and postal worker, had lived 
and worked in Pasadena until he retired in 1973. He later moved to Denver, 
where he stayed until 1981, then moved around until he arrived in Lansing in 
1985.

Former Mayor Mike Boyle, ousted in a 1987 recall election, announced today that 
he will run again for the city's top job. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing his candidacy, Boyle said he decided to run because he loves 
politics and public service and because a surprisingly large number of people 
urged him to enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle, 45, was elected mayor in 1981 and reelected in 1985. But opponents began 
gathering petition signatures shortly after his second term started. They 
accused Boyle of abusing his power, meddling in police affairs, being soft on 
drunken driving and being disrespectful, citing an incident in which he 
allegedly threw pats of butter during a dinner-table argument.

Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said today that three of his aides had 
bought bargain shares in the company at the center of a stock-profiteering 
scandal, but he denied any personal involvement in the affair. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret my aides' purchase of shares occurred because of my poor 
supervision," Nakasone said in a nationally televised news conference. "But I 
am innocent and played no role in the scandal." 
</P>
<P>
The largest opposition party, the Socialists, expressed dissatisfaction with 
Nakasone's remarks and repeated demands that the government summon him to 
testify before Parliament concerning the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal involves sales to 150 influential politicians and businessmen of 
bargain-priced shares in Recruit-Cosmos Co. before the stock was listed for 
public sale. When public trading began, the share prices shot up and the 
bargain buyers profited handsomely. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal has shaken the government, and prosecutors have arrested eight 
people on charges of bribery or violating securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
Nakasone, who was prime minister from 1982-87, denied his involvement in the 
scandal for the first time in an interview last week with CBS News. 
</P>
<P>
Today's news conference marked his first public comments to the Japanese on the

Wade Boggs, almost as confident now in the judicial system as he is at the 
plate, said today that "justice has paid off" in a decision throwing out a 
major section of his former girlfriend's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a landmark decision for me," Boggs said. "I'm in from the ocean and 
headed toward port. . . . It was just a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
"I did it the right way. I went through the legal system. I've said all along 
that it would come out in my favor." 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana threw out a key 
part of Margo Adams' $12-million lawsuit against Boggs, ruling she cannot sue 
for emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
With the decision, Adams, of Costa Mesa, cannot seek $11.5 million for pain she 
contended Boggs caused her by allegedly accusing her of extortion in an FBI 
interview, Boggs' lawyer, Jennifer King, said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy with the decision," Boggs said before joining teammates for the 
daily practice at Chain O'Lakes Park. "I'm pleased with the way that it's gone 
through the judicial system. It shows that there's justice, that the system 
works." 
</P>
<P>
Adams filed the $12-million suit for breach of oral contract after her 
four-year relationship with Boggs. The Boston Red Sox All-Star third baseman, 
who is married with two children, has admitted the affair. 
</P>

"We are extremely happy with this decision," King said. "The part of the 
lawsuit they had hoped to get the most amount of money for is now gone." 
</P>
<P>
In its decision, made public Saturday, the appellate court ruled that the 
emotional distress claim was groundless because Boggs' alleged statements to 
FBI agents constituted privileged information.

Arizona returned to the top of the college basketball poll today, replacing the 
team that took over as No. 1 for them two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma dropped from first to fourth after a 97-84 loss at Missouri last week 
after the Sooners had become the first team to hold the No. 1 ranking for 
consecutive weeks in five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona's Wildcats almost assured themselves of the top spot with a gritty 
77-75 victory over Duke on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Four teams have been ranked No. 1 this season. Duke held the top spot from the 
preseason poll through the first nine polls of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois went to the top for one week and was followed by Oklahoma and then the 
Wildcats for their first appearance of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown and Indiana each moved up one spot to second and third, 
respectively, as the same teams stayed in the Top 20 with only the order 
changing. 
</P>
<P>
sh 54 First-Place Votes 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, 22-3, received 54 first-place votes and 1,305 points from the 
nationwide panel of sportswriters and broadcasters to easily outdistance the 
Hoyas, 22-3, who received five first-place votes and 1,219 points. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana, 23-5, also received five first-place votes and the Hoosiers had 1,122 
points, while the Sooners, 24-4, had one No. 1 vote and 1,083 points. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina, Syracuse and Missouri held the fifth, sixth and seventh spots, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The Tar Heels, 24-5, had 1,052 points, while the Orangemen, 23-5, had the final 
first-place vote and 990 points, 49 more than Missouri, 23-6. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois, 23-4, jumped from 10th to eighth with 846 points. Duke, 21-4, stayed 
ninth with 825 points after beating then-No. 17 North Carolina State and 
staging a valiant come-form-behind effort against Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan, 21-6, rounded out the Top Ten with 676 points as the Wolverines 
jumped from 13th last week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Second 10 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines were followed by Iowa, Seton Hall, Stanford, Louisville, West 
Virginia, Florida State, St. Mary's, (California), Nevada-Las Vegas, Ball State 
and North Carolina State. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville dropped from eighth after losing two of three games last week. The 
Cardinals, 19-7, sandwiched losses to Memphis State and South Carolina around a 
victory over Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State dropped just four places despite losing to both New Orleans and 
La Salle last week. The Seminoles, 19-6, have dropped four straight games. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State, 18-7, also lost two games last week, dropping Atlantic 
Coast Conference games to Duke and Virginia after a non-conference victory over 
North Carolina-Asheville.

NEW COWBOYS OWNER ADMITS FIRING NOT HANDLED WELL

<P>
Tom Landry tearfully bid farewell to the Dallas Cowboys today, saying he loved 
them and asking them to give their best for new coach Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to keep your emotions under control," a red-eyed Landry said. "I 
tried to tell them that this crisis will pass, that you have to keep moving 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Danny White said he had never seen his coach so emotional. "I felt 
for him," White said. 
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old Landry choked up and couldn't finish his speech to the players 
assembled in the lecture hall. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the most difficult things I've had to do," Landry said. "It was 
hard saying goodby to the players." 
</P>
<P>
Landry spent 29 years as the Cowboys head coach, the only one in the team's 
history. His teams won two NFL championships and set a league-record of 20 
consecutive winning seasons. The team went 3-13 last year, worst in the NFL, 
but Landry had hoped to eventually take them to another Super Bowl, the 
Cowboys' sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Landry cleaned out his desk on Sunday, making room for Johnson, who also said 
goodby to a football team today., the University of Miami Hurricanes. He 
coached at Miami five seasons, leading them to the national championship in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a college roommate and football teammate of new 
</P>
<P>
owner Jerry Jones on the unbeaten 1964 Arkansas Razorbacks, will meet the 
Cowboys Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jones admitted in a Little Rock news conference today that "didn't 
do a very good job" dismissing Landry, but he reiterated that he never 
considered anyone but Miami coach Jimmy Johnson for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said he was sensitive to the feelings of Landry, the only head coach in 
the Cowboys' 29-year history, and felt inadequate when he and team president 
Tex Schramm flew to Austin Saturday to break the news. 
</P>
<P>
"I do want to assure everyone that is interested in the Cowboys and certainly 
interested in Coach Landry -- Coach Landry saw my baby blue eyes as quickly as 
humanly possible under the circumstances," Jones, a millionaire oil and gas 
executive from Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
And in Miami, Dolphins assistant head coach David Shula -- son of head coach 
Don Shula -- said today he'll join Johnson at Dallas as assistant head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Wannstedt, defensive coordinator for Johnson at the the University of 
Miami for the past five season, will also join the Cowboys' staff, the Dolphins 
said. Wannstedt had joined the Dolphins just last month.

SEAVER TO JOIN SCULLY IN NBC BOOTH

Tom Seaver is back in the rotation. It won't be on the mound, though. It'll be 
in the TV booth. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, the lame duck network of baseball's Game of the Week, announced today that 
Seaver will be its top color commentator this year, joining play-by-play man 
Vin Scully. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to practice on the days I didn't pitch," Seaver said of broadcasting. 
"Some days I wished that I did do it on the days I was pitching, too." 
</P>
<P>
Seaver has been out of baseball since the end of the 1986 season, when he 
became a free agent and no one wanted him. He tried a comeback with the New 
York Mets in the summer of 1987 but decided he didn't have enough left in his 
right arm. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's final season begins on March 25 with a Los Angeles Dodgers exhibition 
game against the Boston Red Sox. Seaver opens the season in Atlanta, where the 
Braves host the Dodgers on April 8. 
</P>
<P>
After this season, the Game of the Week is no more. CBS, which takes over 
baseball in 1990, will show only 12 games during the season.

Local businessman David Braley received unanimous approval from the Canadian 
Football League's board of governors as the new owner of the Hamilton 
Tiger-Cats. League chairman Roy McMurtry said the board is "totally 
enthusiastic" about accepting the sale of the Ticats to Braley from Harold 
Ballard, despite objections from Hamilton's acting solicitor, Phil Hooker. 
Hooker said earlier this week that the proposed agreement between the city and 
Braley contravenes the Ontario Municipal Act, which disallows municipal aid for 
private companies. But McMurtry, a former attorney general of Ontario, said 
Friday, "I'm quite satisfied what council is doing is legal." Under the 
agreement, the city will charge Braley $1 annually to rent Ivor Wynne Stadium 
and is granting the new owner control of the concession and advertising rights 
for league games at the stadium.

POLICE KILL PIT BULL IN WEST HILLS

A police sergeant shot and killed a pit bull Sunday that severely mauled a 
German shepherd in a West Hills area home, then charged at officers. A woman 
who was not identified called police about 6 p.m. when the pit bull apparently 
wandered into her Deer Lick Drive home through an open door, according to Los 
Angeles police. When Officer John Futrell and Sgt. Bob Rebhan arrived, the dog 
ran from the house and charged at Futrell. Before the dog could attack the 
officer, Rebhan shot it to death with a shotgun. Police believe the dog was 
wild and lived in the hills behind the Deer Lick Drive neighborhood. The German 
shepherd was in critical condition at an animal hospital.
