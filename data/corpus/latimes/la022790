1 IN 4 YOUNG BLACKS IN JAIL OR IN COURT CONTROL, STUDY SAYS 
</P>

<P>
One of four black men in their 20s is in jail, in prison or otherwise under the 
control of criminal courts through probation or parole, according to a crime 
data analysis released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
With prison sentencings increasing, more black men in their 20s are under court 
control than there are black men of all ages in higher education, the report 
found. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, about 6% of white men in their 20s are being held or supervised by 
the criminal courts, and more than four times as many white men are in college 
as are under court control. 
</P>
<P>
The study was released by the Sentencing Project, a Washington nonprofit group 
that lobbies for alternatives to incarceration. Using Justice Department crime 
data, it counted only those convicted of crimes -- not just arrested -- so the 
level of actual criminal activity was greatly understated, its authors said. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal justice experts and black officials said the figures illustrate two 
trends. Since the mid-1970s, most states and the federal government have 
adopted get-tough sentencing laws that have forced judges to impose prison 
terms for certain crimes, including drunk driving and the selling of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the drug trade has overwhelmed many urban black communities, wiping 
out legitimate businesses and steering young men to crime. 
</P>
<P>
This is an "extremely grim picture facing black males," said Julius Chambers, 
executive director of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. "As a nation, we have 
failed to look at this problem and to address it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Marc Mauer, author of the report: "We now risk the possibility of writing 
off an entire generation of black men from leading productive lives. This has 
ominous implications for the black community. We really don't know what it will 
mean for the future because we have never had a situation like this before." 
</P>
<P>
It was not known whether the percentages of blacks, whites and others under 
court control are increasing because comparative figures were not available. 
</P>
<P>
However, law enforcement experts said they believe that they are and said the 
group's statistical analysis appears to be accurate. "They've made some 
reasonable projections, so I think the numbers are correct," said Joseph 
Bessette, acting director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The new report estimated that 1 in 10 Latino males in their 20s is under the 
control of the criminal courts, but it stressed that the figures are much less 
reliable, in part, because of uncertainty about the size of the illegal 
population. 
</P>
<P>
A series of recent reports has documented that crime is pervasive in black 
neighborhoods. In 1987, the California Department of Justice estimated that 40% 
of black males between the ages of 18 and 29 had been arrested for a serious 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
The report issued Monday does not try to explain why so many black men are 
arrested and convicted of crimes, but its authors contend that too many of them 
are locked up. 
</P>
<P>
Mauer favors alternatives, such as forcing criminals to repay their victims and 
to work in community service projects. The large prison populations pose a huge 
and unjustified cost burden, he said, and incarceration ruins the lives of 
offenders who could otherwise be rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
But legislatures and state parole boards have increasingly frowned on programs 
that let inmates out of prison. "Work furloughs had a very good track record, 
but all it took was one Willie Horton and one presidential campaign to blow 
that idea out of the water," Mauer said, referring to George Bush's anti-crime 
ads citing a Massachusetts inmate. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, the number of persons in federal and state prisons has more 
than doubled. In 1980, about 330,000 persons were in prison. By mid-1989, the 
total had reached 670,000, according to the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
The new report shows that about two-thirds of the 609,690 young black males 
under court control are out on probation or parole. However, it shows also 
that, although blacks make up only 12% of the overall population, slightly more 
black inmates than whites are now housed in state prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers, the NAACP lawyer, said that discrimination in the criminal justice 
system is partly to blame. "I don't think there's any doubt about that. It is 
still a white system: white judges, white prosecutors and white juries," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Joan Petersilia, a crime expert at the RAND Corp. in Santa Monica, said her 
studies of criminal punishments show that whites are just as likely as blacks 
to be sent to prison for the same crime. "The research shows that racial 
discrimination in sentencing is not the explanation. They (black males) simply 
commit more of the crimes that lead to imprisonment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said it is possible that black males are more likely than whites 
to be arrested for the same crime. "There is a greater police presence in 
minority communities, so the probability of getting picked up for a crime is 
greater," she said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the analysis, far fewer women than men are convicted of crimes and 
are put under the control of the courts. Of those, black women are far more 
likely than whites to come into the criminal courts. About 2.7% of black 
females in their 20s are under court control, compared to 1.8% of Latino 
females and 1% of white females of the same age. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Sentencing Project, a small group funded by several 
foundations, said they hope their report will spur debate about the get-tough 
approach to crime, and, in particular, the Bush Administration's strategy in 
the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have doubled the incarceration rate, doubled the prison population and what 
do we have to show for it?" asked Malcolm Young, executive director of the 
Sentencing Project. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) agreed, noting that it cost an estimated $2.5 
billion a year to imprison and monitor the black males under the court's 
control. "Surely, we as a nation can aspire to more with this money than punish 
and continue a vicious cycle of hate and despair," Conyers said. 
</P>
<P>
Several California activists who work with black youths said that better 
education and job opportunities could reduce the crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
"If you increase the opportunities or avenues towards opportunity, the crime 
will decrease," said William Cavil, associate director of the Oakland-based 
Institute for the Advanced Study of Black Family and Culture, which has a 
training and development program for black adolescents. "When you increase the 
number of jobs, the educational opportunities, you'll decrease the number of 
black men in jail." 
</P>
<P>
Leon Watkins, who heads a family help hot line in South Los Angeles, explained 
that many young men say to themselves: "I don't have anything. I can't get a 
job, I tried to get an education and I couldn't (but) I'm going to get mine . . 
. . That's what society projects, getting gold cards and all kinds of things 
they know they'll never get. So they take it." 
</P>
<P>
Added Chilton Alphonse, executive director of the Community Youth Sports and 
Arts Foundation, which runs a school and home for at-risk youth: "With the 
influx of cocaine into the black community, many youngsters see that as the 
only way out. Because they've been ignored by the system, they've lost hope. 
And, once they reach that point, you have a serious dilemma, because, if they 
see no way of getting a piece of the pie, then they'll resort to any means 
necessary for survival. And in many instances that means criminal behavior."

Staff writers Charisse Jones in Los Angeles and William J. Eaton in Washington 
contributed to this story.

YOUNG ADULTS IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM: BY RACE 
</P>
<P>
One in four black men between 20 and 29 are in prison, in jail or otherwise 
under the control of criminal courts through parole or probation. By contrast, 
about 6% of white males in their 20s are under the control of a criminal court. 
While far fewer women than men in this age group are under court control, a far 
higher percentage of black women than whites are in prison or jail.

<P>
It is not a great deal bigger than a dishwasher, an ordinary-looking box no 
more impressive than its own packing crate. It would fit nicely into an empty 
corner and make a good perch for a potted plant or -- in the old days -- an ash 
tray. 
</P>
<P>
But looks are deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
The unimpressive black cube, to be delivered to a government laboratory at 
Princeton University in two months, is in fact a new Cray YMP supercomputer. It 
can perform a billion mathematical computations in one second and solve 
millions of equations in mere minutes, tasks that used to take computers years. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, for the government laboratory that ordered it, even the Cray 
YMP is -- in a manner of speaking -- obsolete. Jerry D. Mahlman, director of 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid 
Dynamics Lab here, said: "We are already looking toward machines that will give 
us a trillion operations a second." 
</P>
<P>
What goes on here? What are Mahlman and his associates up to when the fastest 
new supercomputer is overwhelmed before it is uncrated? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is that Mahlman and hundreds of other climate experts in 
laboratories around the world are engaged in one of the most enormous and 
complicated tasks scientists have ever attempted. 
</P>
<P>
JK They are trying to determine if Earth is becoming dangerously warm. 
</P>
<P>
Many scientists fear that man-made carbon dioxide and methane are accumulating 
in the atmosphere and, like the glass walls of a greenhouse, trapping heat near 
the ground. It is a concern that has transformed weather forecasting from an 
obscure combination of art and science into a growth industry. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change, which recently met for three days in Washington, indicated a growing 
consensus that Earth's temperature will rise 1.5 degrees to 4.5 degrees 
centigrade by the middle of the next century unless steps are taken to reduce 
such "greenhouse gas" emissions. 
</P>
<P>
The potential repercussions of overall warming -- rising ocean levels as the 
polar ice caps melt and a northward shifting of the Northern Hemisphere's prime 
agricultural zone -- are subjects of furious debate and international decisions 
of a complexity never before undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe, a decade from now, we will be able to say whether continental dryness, 
such as we experienced in the summer of 1988, will be very probable in the 
future," Mahlman said. "Or maybe we will have found that is not the case at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
To determine whether, when and how much the Pacific Ocean will rise at Santa 
Monica and whether the farming conditions of the Corn Belt will move up to 
North Dakota, scientists must: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Learn from the past. To predict the future, meteorologists must understand 
what has come before. They are studying everything from Antarctic ice cores to 
tax records from ancient Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Understand clouds. Perhaps more than any other variable, they affect 
Earth's temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Study the oceans. They moderate temperature swings -- potentially good news 
to the Southern Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
Mahlman's laboratory on the Princeton campus is one of eight centers -- four 
are in the United States -- that are trying to unravel these mysteries. They 
are on the cutting edge of an unprecedented scientific enterprise: creating 
three-dimensional mathematical grids around the planet in an effort to 
understand how the oceans and the atmosphere will respond to a continued 
outpouring of carbon dioxide and methane. 
</P>
<P>
Based on current models, Mahlman has put the major potential effects of 
doubling the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide into the four categories -- 
possible, probable, very probable and nearly certain. 
</P>
<P>
He considers global warming, increased precipitation worldwide, a warming of 
the northern polar region and a reduction of sea ice all very probable -- a 
likelihood greater than 90%. In the probable, or 80%, category, he places 
increased precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere, drought in North America 
and a rise in the average sea level. In the uncertain category he places 
regional changes in vegetation cover and more tropical storms. Learning from 
the Past Computer technology is not all that limits these scientists' ability 
to forecast the so-called greenhouse effect. There are vast gaps in the raw 
information that must go into the global models. International science is not 
only collecting contemporary data on an unprecedented scale, from the ocean 
depths to the outer limits of the atmosphere, it is also trying to reconstruct 
the ebb, flow and pulsation of climate over the last 160,000 years. What they 
have accomplished is the scientific equivalent of ingenious detective work. 
Joseph Fletcher, now director of NOAA's Environmental Research Laboratories, 
found priceless historic readings of ocean temperatures in British Admiralty 
records. He spent years compiling temperature readings, scrupulously taken by 
sea captains at their boilers' intakes, and produced a landmark collection of 
evidence for oceanographers and modelers. Equally imaginative sleuths have 
found fish harvest records in Peruvian monasteries that can be used to infer 
fluctuations in ocean temperatures. Others have examined fossils, studied core 
samples from trees, combed Egyptian tax records for clues to flooding in the 
Nile Valley and analyzed pollen left behind by ancient forests. For more recent 
evidence in the United States, the search has taken scientists into county and 
state archives for records of water levels in aquifers and wells during 
extended droughts. They have also gleaned information from records of debates 
over Colorado River water rights. "We just must have a better record of the 
last 1,000 years, and a very much better record of the last 200," said John 
Eddy, director of interdisciplinary Earth studies at the University Corp. for 
Atmospheric Research. So far, climate history's nearest approximation of a 
Rosetta Stone is a 2,000-meter ice core extracted during the 1950s from the 
Antarctic region near the Soviet Union's Vostok Station. Because it contains 
bubbles of air trapped as long as 160,000 years ago and across the intervening 
ice ages, the Vostok core has enabled scientists to establish a link between 
carbon dioxide and methane levels and surface temperature. This stark, frozen 
record shows that carbon dioxide content increased from 180 parts per million 
during the last great Ice Age (about 160,000 years ago) to 280 p.p.m. before 
the Industrial Revolution in the 18th Century. That level has reached some 350 
p.p.m. and is rising at a rate of about 0.4% a year. Other core samples have 
been taken from the Himalayas in Tibet, from the Peruvian Andes and the ocean 
floor. Cores taken in the mountains of Tibet by Lonnie Thompson of the 
University of Ohio'Clouds and Oceans The data gaps that truly bedevil the model 
makers, however, are not the vagaries of climate history but a lack of the 
information needed to fathom climatic feedback processes and the contributions 
of oceans and clouds to cooling and warming processes. The No. 1 priority, 
scientists generally agree, is to learn more about clouds. This is where the 
scarcity of information is most profound. The broader questions begging to be 
answered, said Gordon J. MacDonald, a former chairman of the U.S. Council on 
Environmental Quality who began studying global warming nearly 20 years ago, 
concern the balance of cloud types and the effect of climate warming on their 
formation and distribution. Although it is established that clouds have an 
overall cooling effect by reflecting sunlight, they have not become a part of 
global climate models. Because so many clouds of all types are so small and so 
widely scattered, scientists have yet to put together a coherent picture of 
their formation, their characteristics and their dissipation. There is vast 
ignorance about the reflectivity of small clouds, the processes that go on 
inside them and their local effect. "We are just beginning to understand the 
physical processes and the relevance of the altitudes and types," said Guy 
Brasseur, an atmospheric chemist at the National Center for Atmospheric 
Research. The role of the oceans is somewhat better understood, although 
information is also limited. "Sea surface data on a global scale is very 
spotty," said Robert W. Correll, vice chairman of the Committee on Earth 
Sciences, which coordinates U.S. global change research. "There are many areas 
of the world where we have no data at all. Zilch." The most sophisticated ocean 
modeling is done at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab, where scientists have 
been at it for 20 years. In a study there last year, Syukuro Manabe and his 
colleagues linked an ocean model with an atmospheric model and projected carbon 
dioxide buildup at a rate of 1% a year for the next 200 years. The experiment 
predicted a dramatic warming of the Northern Hemisphere. In the test case, the 
Southern Hemisphere, particularly in the southernmost latitudes, stubbornly 
resisted warming. The conclusion was that the much larger expanses of oceans 
below the Equator kept the atmosphere from heating up. "Down in the region of 
the Antarctic," Mahlman said, "there is an upwelling, a mixing, bringing up old 
water that hasn't seen the surface in perhaps 500 years, water that you might 
say hasn't had time to be warmed by the greenhouse effect. The temperature of 
the air is determined by the temperature of the water. This is a stunner, 
because it says that the ocean contributes strongly to the distribution of 
climate change." The dearth of crucial data on clouds and oceans may persist 
for years. Many modelers scoffed when the George C. Marshall Institute 
concluded last year that increased investment in supercomputers could pay off 
in firm scientific evidence to back up policy decisions in as little time as 
three years. The report was controversial in another respect as well: It 
concluded that current forecasts are not accurate enough to form bases for 
policy decisions. That conclusion was said to have made a deep impression on 
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, one of the principal makers of 
environmental policy in the George Bush Administration. It was heatedly 
challenged by environmentalists, who feared it would provide an excuse for 
delaying needed action. In that debate, scientists, for the most part, remain 
on the sideline. Many of them counsel against trying to overwhelm the problem 
with massive infusions of money. "ted, we are data-limited and we are 
talent-limited," Mahlman said, "but I have made myself unpopular with people 
who want to throw money at the climate problem. If somebody told me they wanted 
to double the (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab) budget next year, I would say 
no." The overall effort to produce reliable models will be massively expensive 
nevertheless. The cost of collecting the crucial ocean and cloud data will 
dwarf the outlays for computers and modeling laboratories. The Bush 
Administration's proposed budget would invest half of a $2-billion increase in 
environmental funds programs in global warming research. Yet $1.03 billion is 
barely the tip of the iceberg. Estimates are that development and 15 years of 
operation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Earth 
Observation System will cost $32 billion. Except for the manned exploration of 
the moon, it would be the most expensive program in the agency's history. Earth 
Observation System instruments will provide scientists with the precise kinds 
of information they need to build the high-resolution models that will begin to 
make regional climate projections feasible. They are expected to supply global 
cloud counts, measure their altitudes and identify them by type. They will be 
able to observe clouds as small as 0.25 kilometer in diameter, compared to the 
25-kilometer limit of today's satellites. But the first Earth Observation 
System platform is not due to be launched until 1997. In the meantime, exciting 
new data on the ocean is expected to come from a U.S. TOPEX satellite to be 
launched by the French. The satellite, scheduled to begin operation in 1992, 
will carry an advanced altimeter to measure the height of the ocean surface 
within about 2 centimeters. This information perhaps will shed light on 
questions such as how water carried north in the Gulf Stream flows back to the 
Equator. Climate-modeling centers and satellite operators also face problems in 
managing their archives. In the basement of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab, 
30,000 tapes are stored. In the archives of the National Center for Atmospheric 
Research at Table Mesa, near Boulder, Colo., the tape file now runs to 75,000 
numbers. The massive accumulation of data is only a hint of things to come. One 
Earth Observation System platform will produce 10 trillion bytes of data daily. 
The plan is to have two of them in orbit at a time for 15 years. Only by 
compiling more and more data can scientists hope to achieve the necessary 
precision in their climatological models. The coarse grids now in use have data 
points that are about 500 kilometers apart. "If we are to understand more 
specifically the regional responses to climate change, then we must have higher 
resolution," said Guy Brasseur of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. 
"When we reduce the distance between grid points by a factor of two, our 
requirement for computer power increases by a factor of 10. We think the 
prediction of regional response requires a resolution of 50 to 100 kilometers, 
so we need two or three new generations of computers." Equally important to 
some scientists is understanding what the models are saying. Mahlman recently 
tried to run a high-resolution model on the old computer at the Geophysical 
Fluid Dynamics Lab, the one that is to be replaced with the new Cray YMP. "I 
have been able to run it, but I can't make sense of it," he said. "The weakest 
link in all of this may be the inability to get at the numbers. It's not enough 
just to crunch the numbers, you have to know what they mean."

DEMOCRATS' CANDIDATES FOR GOVERNOR SLASH AND PARRY;

VAN DE KAMP: ATTORNEY GENERAL VOWS TO SHINE A SPOTLIGHT ON LEGISLATION 
GENERATED BY SPECIAL INTERESTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Democrat John Van de Kamp intensified his angry war of words with the 
"old-guard politicians" of the Legislature on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Standing next to the Capitol, where he hopes to serve as the state's next chief 
executive, Van de Kamp promised that during this year's campaign he will expose 
bills by lawmakers that are driven by special-interest campaign contributions 
-- bills, he said, that "violate the public interest." 
</P>
<P>
Further, Van de Kamp said that if elected governor, he would require that all 
bills be screened with a "special-interest impact statement." He said he would 
veto those he found owing more to money than merit. "All of them," he added. 
</P>
<P>
On the second day of his ritual announcement of his candidacy for governor, Van 
de Kamp continued to attack his Democratic gubernatorial rival, Dianne 
Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, in her hometown of San Francisco, Van de Kamp had devoted much of 
his campaign speech to criticisms of her. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, he charged that she had been part of an effort in 1988 to "confuse 
voters and prevent the imposition of limits on campaign spending." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's campaign ridiculed the charge as "a world-class cheap shot." 
</P>
<P>
In all, it was a biting and accusatory day for Van de Kamp, who portrayed 
himself as the foremost white-hat crusader against greedy interests who control 
the state government. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that after his nearly eight years as California's attorney 
general, "some will say we should have moved sooner on ethics." He added, "I 
agree with that . . . (but) better now than later -- and late is no excuse for 
never." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp first picked this fight with official Sacramento last year. 
Describing state government as a swamp, he proposed a ballot proposition to 
limit the terms of office for state officials, ban honorariums and restrict 
other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Leading lawmakers of his own party responded by drawing close to Feinstein and 
seeking to undercut Van de Kamp's financial support. Some hoped they could back 
him down from his drive to qualify his so-called "ethics initiative." 
</P>
<P>
To dispel that notion, Van de Kamp said Monday he periodically would use the 
Capitol as a backdrop for his attacks on the Legislature. "Each candidate must 
make a fundamental decision: Do you want to drain the political swamp or do you 
want to swim in it?" 
</P>
<P>
As if on cue, swarms of small insects coincidentally rose from the grounds of 
the Capitol and filled the air as Van de Kamp spoke. Spectators swatted and 
giggled. 
</P>
<P>
His arrival in Sacramento provided an unexpectedly tense moment. The campaign's 
plum-colored Gulfstream turboprop charter airplane blew a tire on landing, 
giving off a trailing plume of smoke as it came to a standstill. 
</P>
<P>
At the Capitol, Van de Kamp sought to provide evidence of special-interest 
legislation now pending before lawmakers. He cited a vaguely worded proposal 
recently offered by Dominic L. Cortese (D-San Jose), chairman of the Assembly 
Local Government Committee. The subject is the creation of new towns in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general said he was suspicious that lawmakers intended to sneak in 
last-minute amendments at the request of developers that would allow new towns 
that skirt local growth and planning restrictions to be established in Southern 
California. Such a ploy has been attempted in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Cortese acknowledged that major amendments were planned to his bill, but said 
they were not designed to do the bidding of developers. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp speculated that by drawing publicity to the measure now, he 
probably forestalled any chance of special interests obtaining favored 
treatment. And he promised to return to the Capitol again and again, raising 
the same kind of public suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I've earned the opposition of the old-guard politicians. And I'm here 
to tell you I welcome that opposition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also delighted in noting that while Feinstein supported one political reform 
initiative that was on the June 1988 ballot -- Proposition 73 -- he backed 
another -- Proposition 68. He stressed that the Feinstein-backed proposition, 
which won the most votes and took effect, was written in part by Democratic 
state Sen. Joseph Montoya of Whittier, who subsequently was convicted on 
corruption charges and resigned his Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
"Together, they and many others did what they set out to do. They wiped out 
real political reform in this state," Van de Kamp said. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers responded, "John Van de Kamp has been 
attorney general in Sacramento for seven years. Why didn't he catch Joe 
Montoya?" 
</P>
<P>
One key difference in the rival proposals dealt with public financing. Van de 
Kamp supported the unsuccessful aspect of Proposition 68 that called for 
partial taxpayer funding of campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful that more than half of Feinstein's campaign has been self-financed, Van 
de Kamp said tauntingly: "I am against a system that permits wealthy people to 
buy their way into public office. Dianne Feinstein obviously disagrees."

BUSH URGED TO BAN MONTEREY BAY DRILLING; 
</P>
<P>
RESOURCES: OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION IN THE MARINE SANCTUARY IS BEING DISCUSSED 
BY THE ADMINISTRATION, REP. PANETTA SAYS. HE CALLS IT 'NUTS.'

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration is debating whether to allow oil and gas drilling in 
the newly established Monterey Bay national marine sanctuary, Rep. Leon Panetta 
(D-Carmel Valley) charged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's nuts," Panetta said at a news conference where he appealed to 
President Bush to support a ban on oil-gas exploration or development in the 
highly sensitive waters, which includes parts of the Big Sur coastline and 
breeding areas for seals and sea lions. 
</P>
<P>
Congress passed legislation in 1988, signed into law by then-President Ronald 
Reagan, requiring the designation of Monterey Bay as a sanctuary and setting a 
Dec. 31, 1989, deadline for the executive branch to issue regulations for its 
use. 
</P>
<P>
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration proposed a ban on oil and 
gas drilling as part of the proposed regulations, Panetta said, but the 
departments of energy and interior objected. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the regulations have been delayed two months beyond the deadline 
set by Congress and, Panetta said, raise the possibility that oil and gas 
development may be allowed if there is nothing to forbid it in the federal 
rules for Monterey Bay. 
</P>
<P>
In a telegram to the President, the California lawmaker said: "Should the 
decision of your Administration be to allow new drilling within a designated 
marine sanctuary, this would constitute a major reversal of policies protecting 
sanctuaries and a major violation of your own stated commitment to protecting 
sensitive areas of our coastline." 
</P>
<P>
Alluding to former Interior Secretary James Watt, known for his pro-industry 
outlook, Panetta added: "If we got back to business as usual, as it was under 
the Watt Administration, I think people (in California) will feel 
double-crossed." 
</P>
<P>
An environmental group, the Center for Marine Conservation, joined in the 
criticism of the Bush Administration for postponing the issuance of a draft 
environmental impact statement and management plan for the Monterey Bay 
sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
"These new delays suggest a covert attempt to weaken protection against oil and 
gas development within Monterey Bay," said Jack Sobel, an official of the 
center. "This raises serious questions . . . of whether the (oil) industry's 
influence is subverting the public process in designating national marine 
sanctuaries." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Jean-Michel Cousteau of the Cousteau Society said oil drilling 
in Monterey Bay "really makes no sense . . . in light of the problems we've had 
recently." 
</P>
<P>
"We know very well that we are not technologically equipped to face oil spills 
without major damage to the environment," Cousteau said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am for the concept of access in case of national defense needs," he said. 
"But until then, we'd be much better off buying the oil from wherever we can 
get it and preserving those finite resources that are dwindling in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Panetta said Bush's decision on Monterey Bay would send a signal on another 
issue -- whether to allow oil-gas development in two other areas off the 
California coast on the Outer Continental Shelf. 
</P>
<P>
The news conference was called before the President departs Wednesday for a 
trip to California. Bush has been asked to announce his decision on development 
of Outer Continental Shelf areas off the Northern and Southern California 
coasts during his trip this week. Administration sources, however, said White 
House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu had requested additional information from 
federal agencies on the issue and that an announcement of the drilling policy 
will be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, California Gov. George Deukmejian, here for a national governors' 
conference, criticized members of California's congressional delegation who 
have successfully held off drilling in vast areas under state jurisdiction with 
a series of legislated moratoriums. 
</P>
<P>
Moratoriums, he said, serve not only to prevent drilling but also prevent the 
kind of studies necessary for responsible development of oil and gas resources 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a moratorium, and you have an all-out ban, you are not going to 
have any studies," Deukmejian told reporters. "And then a few years from now, 
if we have another energy crisis where we want to get every bit of oil and gas 
within our own jurisdiction developed, then we are not going to have the 
benefit of the studies, and the outcome will be that we will go forward hastily 
and that's the time when you can do great environmental damage." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), the likely GOP candidate for governor this year, 
disagreed with his fellow Republican on the issue, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be willing to make him (Deukmejian) a small bet -- we've been able to 
prevent drilling for a long time now and, if anything, recent events such as 
the Exxon Valdez and Huntington Beach oil spills have shown it's just not worth 
the risk," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the governor's remarks, Panetta said that he and others who 
supported the moratoriums favored a balanced approach to oil drilling.

Floyd H. Jergesen, 79, an orthopedic surgeon who pioneered development of bone 
implants and methods to control bone infection. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, Jergesen's work focused on the human body's acceptance of 
metallic implants to replace or support bone. His early research in the field 
helped lay the groundwork for the field known as biomechanics. A technique for 
managing bone and soft tissue infections was dubbed the "Jergey Tube" after 
Jergesen developed the method to both drain wounds and administer antibiotics. 
After 34 years of teaching at the UC San Francisco, Jergesen retired from 
teaching in 1980, when he was appointed to the emeritus faculty. In San

Soviet "refusenik" David Goldfarb, who successfully resisted KGB pressure to 
frame a U.S. journalist as a spy but then was allowed to emigrate to the United 
States in 1986, died Saturday of heart failure at age 71, his son said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Goldfarb died of heart failure at Georgetown University Medical Center in 
Washington but had lived in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Frail and in ill health before he was allowed to leave the Soviet Union after 
the intervention of American industrialist Armand Hammer, Goldfarb was a 
biologist who had tried to emigrate to Israel in 1984. That was after he 
exposed what he said was an attempt by the secret police to help them frame 
American journalist Nicholas Daniloff. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp., has often acted as an 
intermediary in U.S.-Soviet affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Goldfarb was a pioneer in molecular genetics who said he had been told by the 
KGB that he and his family could fly to Israel if he agreed to hand Daniloff 
incriminating documents. After he refused, his visa was revoked and he was 
accused of seeking to smuggle national security material out of the country. 
That accusation was later dropped but Goldfarb still was denied permission to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
Daniloff, a U.S. News &amp; World Report correspondent, confirmed that scenario 
after Goldfarb was safely on U.S. soil and praised the white-haired geneticist, 
who suffered from diabetes and heart problems and had had his left leg removed, 
as "one of the most admirable men I have ever known." 
</P>
<P>
Most recently Goldfarb had been a visiting scholar at the National Institutes 
of Health in Bethesda, Md.

THE TRIUMPH OF DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Change keeps on happening, and the winds of change wafted down to Central 
America and turned Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega into just another 
discredited Marxist leader with a salesman's tattered sample case of ideology 
and a history of failed economic promises. Nicaraguans discovered for 
themselves that his collectivist dogma just did not cut it at the dinner table. 
It did not deliver the goods. It went bankrupt years ago, and Sunday its 
shareholders voted for a whole new management team. 
</P>
<P>
And so in one sunny and bold stroke the people of Nicaragua have seemingly 
managed to achieve the goal that has so long eluded Washington and the Contras: 
the removal of the Sandinistas from power. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega himself quickly assured the world that the Sandinistas would accept the 
voters' decision. He was never so gracious in power as he was Sunday in defeat. 
One hopes he'll be true to his word and render every assistance in what could 
be a difficult political transition. The election turned out far, far cleaner 
than anyone could possibly have hoped. This not only reflects well on the 
Ortega government and the Nicaraguan people but also on former U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter, Elliot Richardson, wave after wave of election observers from the 
United Nations and the Organization of American States and other well-meaning 
souls. 
</P>
<P>
A triumphant Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of the National Opposition Union won 
victory as the head of a broad and disparate alliance of various 
anti-Sandinista groups that may not prove durable. Some observers are already 
doubting that Chamorro will prove any more effective than, say, Philippine 
President Corazon Aquino. No matter for now. Let us simply congratulate the 
Nicaraguan people on their good judgment and decisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Their decision could improve the stock of El Salvador and Honduras as well. 
This whole section of the planet has known more than its share of war, poverty 
and despair. Sure, many, many problems remain (see following editorial). But 
new opportunity has visited that land and hope has been reborn.

POLICE SHOOTINGS IN LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with great interest your editorial "When Should a Cop Shoot?" (Feb. 18). 
The editorial noted that there was a major difference between New York and Los 
Angeles police officers in that Los Angeles police officers were twice as 
likely to use deadly force as New York police officers. 
</P>
<P>
As a person who was a practicing attorney in both New York City and Los Angeles 
County, the reason for such disparity is easy to understand. In New York City, 
the minority groups have political clout; here in Los Angeles they do not. And 
most of the deadly force used by police in Los Angeles is in the minority 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Until the minorities have enough political "juice" to enable them to have 
meaningful input as to the selection of a chief of police or the sheriff of the 
county, the "restrained response" that you call for from law enforcement 
leaders will not arrive very quickly.

U.S. MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your editorial describing Gen. Maxwell Thurman's congressional testimony on 
the Salvadoran war ("The General Lays It on the Line," Feb. 12), one sentence 
jumps out as absolutely absurd. After citing military assessments that, despite 
massive U.S. military aid, the Salvadoran war is at a stalemate and cannot be 
won, you conclude: "That's why, when Congress votes to renew that aid -- as it 
is likely to do very soon -- it must add conditions . . . to let Cristiani 
negotiate peace." 
</P>
<P>
Can someone please explain how renewing military aid leads to peace? 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, Archbishop Oscar Romero wrote to President Carter pleading not 
to send military aid to his country. His letter was ignored. In 10 years this 
country has sent $4 billion and what has it bought? A stalemated war. Romero's 
assassination. Continued military attacks on civilians. Generals beyond the 
control of civilian and judicial authority. More dead priests. 
</P>
<P>
If President Bush wants to strengthen the hand of his friend Cristiani, the 
best way is to cut off military aid and to place strict conditions on other 
aid. I bet I'm not the only one who can think of better uses for $1 million per 
day right here in Los Angeles. Let the Salvadoran generals find someone else to 
buy their bullets and bombs.

BORDER CHANGES THAT FRIGHTEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The weekend's voting in Lithuania surprised no one. The Soviet Union's first 
multiparty election in more than seven decades saw most Communist Party 
candidates, particularly those who urged keeping strong ties with Moscow, 
repudiated. The parliamentary candidates backed by the nationalist independence 
movement Sajudis won 72 of the 90 contests that were decided. Runoff voting 
scheduled soon in 51 remaining parliamentary districts will probably see 
similar Sajudis gains. Then will begin one of the more momentous processes in 
recent Soviet history. 
</P>
<P>
With the political and moral authority of a sweeping electoral mandate behind 
it, Lithuania is preparing to claim its national independence, 50 years after 
its forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union. The Soviet constitution 
guarantees, without saying how, that any of the nation's 15 republics may 
secede. But until just a short time ago anyone foolish enough to advocate such 
a step would have been clapped into prison, and any movement organized to 
promote it would have been crushed. Now, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev abjures 
the use of force to block Lithuania's move toward independence. His only 
recourse is to try to delay matters. To that end he argues, rather weakly, that 
Lithuania's assertion of independence must be reviewed by the other republics. 
More effectively, he can try to drag out the negotiations about Lithuania's 
future economic and military relations with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
But Lithuanians who have never accepted the legitimacy of Soviet rule are 
unlikely to remain passive in the face of endless delays. Gorbachev surely 
understands that. He also understands the encouragement that a breakaway 
Lithuania could give the Soviet Union's other restive republics. From the 
Baltic states to Central Asia, tens of millions of non-Slavic Soviet citizens 
have never been comfortable within the Soviet empire. They will watch with the 
greatest interest what Lithuania is allowed to do. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of Europe will be watching as well, with mixed emotions. While no one 
who supports democracy can readily oppose self-determination for those so long 
denied a voice in their own destiny, no European familiar with the Continent's 
tortured history of conquest, ethnic hatreds and territorial claims can be 
wholly at ease with the prospect that border changes may loom once again. 
That's why many Europeans have become fed up with West German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl's continued weasling on the question of recognizing Germany's border with 
Poland. For good reason, any unresolved boundary issue is seen as threatening. 
</P>
<P>
The key difference in Lithuania, of course, is that restoring the Baltic 
state's pre-1939 border with the Soviet Union would not be seen as a danger to 
anyone's security. But Lithuania isn't Germany, which is why Kohl's coy 
equivocations are making people exceedingly nervous.

NOW COMES THE HARD PART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was an uphill struggle, but the election of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro as 
president of Nicaragua may eventually look like a relatively easy achievement 
when compared to the daunting array of problems facing her new government. 
</P>
<P>
First comes the exchange of power with the current Sandinista regime. Ousted 
President Daniel Ortega is being admirably statesmanlike in his public 
pronouncements, promising to respect the election results. But Ortega speaks 
only for the pragmatists in the Sandinista party, and Chamorro may well need 
his help to keep the reins on ideologues like Interior Minister Tomas Borge, 
who built the Soviet-style police apparatus in Nicaragua. Ortega must also 
persuade his older brother Humberto, the defense minister, to depoliticize the 
Nicaraguan army, now little more than a branch of the Sandinista party. A good 
first step would be to substantially scale down its 60,000-plus size. 
</P>
<P>
Next comes the challenge of trying to build a government from an unwieldy 
coalition of 14 political parties ranging from Communist to conservative. If 
Chamorro can't pull it off, she may wind up facing a congress in which the 
largest faction is the Sandinistas. That's a scenario for political gridlock 
that could reduce Chamorro to a weak political symbol, revered but not 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the challenge of demobilizing the Contra army created by the U.S. 
government to pressure the Sandinistas. There never was much reason for the 
Contras to exist, and now there is none. But thousands of them are still 
wandering about the hinterlands of Nicaragua and neighboring Honduras, heavily 
armed and, in some cases, saying that they will not give up until they're good 
and ready. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us to the issue of Washington's role in Nicaragua, and Chamorro's 
toughest problem of all: rebuilding an economy shattered after almost 12 years 
of revolution and war. Not all of Nicaragua's financial troubles -- inflation, 
unemployment, food and fuel shortages -- are Washington's fault. The thievery 
of the old Somoza dictatorship and the incompetence of the Sandinistas' 
economic planners contributed to the chaos. But the embargo imposed by the 
Reagan Administration hurt by cutting Nicaragua off from its biggest and 
closest market for its goods. Opening the U.S. market to Nicaragua could do 
wonders for the psyche, not to mention the pocketbook, of the country's 
economically battered businesses and workers. The least President Bush could do 
is lift all economic sanctions against Nicaragua now.

YEAR-ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been a year-round teacher for the Tehachapi Unified School District. Our 
district, faced with the exact population-explosion problem as Los Angeles, was 
forced to adopt the system. 
</P>
<P>
Our district attempted to pass a bond issue but the voters rejected it, forcing 
the year-round schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents and community people howled about the "quality" education being 
diminished. Their solution, just like the middle-class parents in Los Angeles, 
was more money to prevent this. School districts adopting year-round schedules 
are saving facilities, improving education and providing a morale boost to 
teachers and students. Parents wanting a long summer vacation need to look at 
their "spoiled child" syndrome and support a system that saves tax dollars, 
time and enhances education. Year-round education is the future we must accept 
-- not fight.

CHANGES

<TEXT>
<P>
A lot of changes have occurred throughout the world in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
What about America? What about Los Angeles? There may be no need for a change 
in government but the problems in America are taking a back seat to those in 
the rest of the world. Change should be taking place right here. Build centers 
for the homeless. Increase the size of the Police Department. Put more money 
into the school system. Build a subway system. 
</P>
<P>
The country and this area have grown stagnant. Progress in all areas is 
necessary for the survival of this country. Is there anyone listening? Do not 
look at the television; look out the window instead.

An announcement by the postmaster general mentioned that he would seek another

What a hypocrisy on the general public. 
</P>
<P>
For the past several years, an average of over 95% of the mail I have received 
can be classified as "junk mail." I discussed this with my friends and 
neighbors. It seems that they, too, suffer from the deluge of junk.

The postmaster general should treble the charges for this junk mail. It might 
afford some relief to our increasing problem with finding enough landfills for

There were two articles printed recently that seem to represent, sadly, the 
shortsighted vision of our nation. 
</P>
<P>
In one, even after the irreversible damage caused by the oil spill off 
Huntington Beach, President Bush sees no reason to prevent oil drilling off our 
California coast. 
</P>
<P>
The other article related that in Northern California, the Pacific Lumber Co. 
has no qualms about felling 2,000-year-old redwood trees. 
</P>
<P>
Do the people involved in these two incidents have no feeling for history; for 
the eons of time the beaches and redwoods have survived; for the enormity of 
what they have done or propose to do?

MORNING BRIEFING: LAST LINE ON REGGIE'S EYE CHART: T-A-K-E T-H-A-T, G-E-O-R-G-E

More from the upcoming book "Damned Yankees," by Bill Madden and Moss Klein: 
</P>
<P>
After a couple of defensive lapses, Reggie Jackson was asked by Yankee owner 
George Steinbrenner to have his eyes examined. Jackson was offended. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the eye test, coach Jeff Torborg, now manager of the Chicago 
White Sox, threw batting practice for Jackson in Detroit. Jackson asked pitcher 
George Frazier to shag fly balls. Frazier said he would. 
</P>
<P>
"OK," Jackson said. "Go sit in the upper deck." 
</P>
<P>
Frazier says: "What happened next was the most unbelievable display of hitting 
I ever saw. Of the two dozen or so balls Torborg threw to him, there wasn't but 
two that didn't leave the ballpark, and most of them landed in the upper deck." 
</P>
<P>
When Frazier came back to the clubhouse, Jackson was waiting. 
</P>
<P>
"Go tell The Man what you think of my eyesight," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Feb. 27, 1959, which team beat the then-Minneapolis Lakers in 
the highest-scoring game in NBA history? 
</P>
<P>
Chomping at the bit: New York Met pitcher Dwight Gooden needs spring training 
to test his right shoulder, which was injured and kept him out of all but two 
games after the All-Star break last season. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gooden of the lockout by baseball's owners: "I've been working hard, 
throwing about 75%, and I feel good. But until I face live hitting, until the 
adrenaline pumps and I let it go, I won't know if I'm back. I don't know now, 
and it's killing me." 
</P>
<P>
Add Gooden: The right-hander has another reason to want the gates opened. He is 
17-2 in April with a 2.06 earned-run average. After April, he is 83-37 with a 
2.73 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Add Mets: Relief pitcher Roger McDowell of the Philadelphia Phillies, on being 
traded by the Mets: "It was hard to be happy. And it wasn't just my situation. 
Keith (Hernandez) was hurt and spending time in the clubhouse. He was real 
frustrated. Kid (Gary Carter) was frustrated, too. And the guys behind him 
(Barry Lyons and Mackey Sasser) weren't real happy. Straw (Darryl Strawberry) 
didn't have a good year. Doc (Dwight Gooden) got hurt . . . There was a lot of 
frustration and resentment in the clubhouse." 
</P>
<P>
Running on two cylinders: The Boston Celtics' Kevin McHale, after a recent loss 
to the Utah Jazz: "You've got to have more margin for error than we do now. 
We're a very fragile team. If we're out of sync, it's a disaster. We've got to 
have more room for error than we give ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be going zoom, zoom, but instead it's clunk, clunk, clunk." 
</P>
<P>
Add NBA: NBA cards are bringing in about $50,000 per week in the Oregon Lottery 
-- about $200,000 per week less than expected. "People don't want to bet on 
anything except football," said lottery director Jim Davey.

<P>
Gold closed sharply lower Monday and silver ended at a five-month low as 
Japanese investors sold precious metals to cover losses on the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The key 225-share Nikkei index closed down 1,569.10, or 4.5%, at 33,321.87, the 
second-biggest fall in its history. 
</P>
<P>
"After being battered for a week, Japanese investors are being pushed to raise 
cash by selling stagnant assets," one metals trader said. 
</P>
<P>
At New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for April delivery fell $6.40 to $411.80 
an ounce after a recovering from a six-week low of $409.50. 
</P>
<P>
Taking a lead from gold, Comex silver futures closed at five-month lows. March 
silver fell 9.2 cents to $5.148 an ounce, penetrating the last contract low of 
$5.176 set Jan. 3. May silver lost 9.5 cents to $5.23. 
</P>
<P>
At the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures recovered from a plunge 
to five-month lows, but the market still had large closing losses. The April 
delivery fell $15.40 to $511.10 an ounce after rallying from a low of $506.00. 
</P>
<P>
Traders on overnight precious metals desks said the selling originated in 
Japan, hitting gold and platinum in the Far East. The selling cascaded to 
markets in Europe, London and, later, New York.

VALLEY EARNINGS: MARTIN LAWRENCE EARNINGS RISE 10% FOR PERIOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Martin Lawrence Limited Editions Inc. said its earnings rose 10% in the fourth 
quarter that ended Dec. 31, to $1.8 million from $1.6 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues for the Van Nuys operator of art galleries increased to $13.2 million 
from $9.2 million, a 43% gain. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which sells art on both retail and wholesale levels, attributed 
the growth in earnings to strong retail sales at its art galleries and the 
opening of 11 new galleries during 1989. 
</P>
<P>
For the year that ended Dec. 31, Martin Lawrence reported net income of $7.4 
million, up 27% from $5.8 million in the previous year. Revenues totaled $48.8 
million, a 40% gain from $34.8 million the year before.

VALLEY EARNINGS: TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES PROFIT PLUNGES 80% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traditional Industries in Agoura Hills said its fiscal second-quarter profit 
tumbled 80% from a year earlier on a 10% decline in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
In the quarter ended Dec. 31, Traditional, which sells packages of photographic 
products and services directly to consumers, said its net income fell to 
$309,000 from $1.56 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Its revenue dropped to $13.5 million from $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of its fiscal year, Traditional's profit plummeted 72% from 
a year earlier, to $1.27 million from $4.56 million, but its six-month revenue 
climbed 18% to $33.5 million from $28.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional attributed the lower earnings to higher debt-interest and 
administrative costs, and to higher than expected legal and accounting costs 
related to its recent settlement of a dispute with the Federal Trade 
Commission, which had objected to some of Traditional's sales practices.

VALLEY EARNINGS: HUNTWAY REPORTS LOSS OF $1.6 MILLION IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huntway Partners, a Valencia-based producer of liquid asphalt, said it lost 
$1.62 million in the fourth quarter of 1989 despite a 35% jump in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The loss in the quarter that ended Dec. 31 compared with a $441,000 loss a year 
earlier, and reflected lower profit margins due to severe price competition in 
the liquid-asphalt industry, Huntway said. 
</P>
<P>
Liquid asphalt is derived from crude oil, and the rise in oil prices in the 
quarter helped lift Huntway's revenue to $24.2 million from $17.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
For all of 1989, Huntway lost $1.78 million compared with a $3.16-million 
profit a year earlier, and its revenue rose 8% to $89.5 million from $82.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Huntway went public in November, 1988, and used the proceeds to reduce its 
debt. Its 1988 financial results are on a pro forma basis: that is, they 
reflect what Huntway's results would have been had Huntway gone public and 
reduced its debt at the start of 1988.

VALLEY EARNINGS: SUPERIOR'S PROFIT UP 15% IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Superior Industries International Inc., a Van Nuys builder of automotive 
wheels, said it earned $5 million in the fourth quarter that ended Dec. 31, up 
15% from $4.3 million a year earlier. Revenue rose to $60.9 million from $56.7 
million, a 7% gain. 
</P>
<P>
The company said its results improved despite declining domestic auto sales 
because it increased its market for aluminum wheels and won its first contract 
with a Japanese car maker, Mazda. 
</P>
<P>
For the year that ended Dec. 31, Superior reported a 23% gain in net income to 
$16.2 million from $13.1 million in 1988. Revenues increased 23% to $246.1 
million from $200.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Superior said it began shipments of wheels from its new 
manufacturing plant in Pittsburg, Kan. When fully operational, the plant is 
expected to employ 700 people.

VALLEY EARNINGS: PERCEPTRONICS CUTS LOSSES FOR 3RD-QUARTER GAIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Perceptronics Inc., a Woodland Hills maker of computer trainers and simulators 
for the military, said it earned $324,276 in the third quarter that ended Dec. 
31, compared to a loss of $2.35 million a year earlier. The company said its 
revenues decreased 22% for the quarter to $6.72 million from $8.63 million a 
year before. 
</P>
<P>
A substantial portion of net income for the quarter stemmed from a $123,100 tax 
benefit. The year-earlier results included revenues and losses from the 
company's FAAC Perceptronics unit, which it sold last spring. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months that ended Dec. 31, Perceptronics reported a net income of 
$815,982, compared to a loss of $2.51 million in the same period a year ago. 
Nine-month revenues dropped 7% to $20.86 million from $22.49 million.

PerfectData Corp. reported net income of $4,000 for the fiscal third quarter 
that ended Dec. 31, down 84% from $25,000 in net income a year earlier.

The Simi Valley company, which makes products for cleaning and maintaining

The company said the decline in earnings in the latest quarter reflected costs 
associated with launching a new line of devices that hold copy for computer

For the nine months that ended Dec. 31, PerfectData reported $7,000 in

VALLEY EARNINGS: CHEROKEE GROUP REPORTS $78,000 LOSS FOR QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cherokee Group, a Sunland-based apparel and shoe concern, said it lost $78,000 
in its fiscal second quarter, compared with a year-earlier profit of $1.57 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The loss came despite a 51% surge in Cherokee's sales in the quarter that ended 
Dec. 2, to $42 million from $27.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of its fiscal year, Cherokee lost $194,000, contrasted with 
an $891,000 profit a year earlier, and its six-month sales rose 30% to $92.3 
million from $71.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee was acquired by a private investor group in May, 1989, for $174 
million, most of which was borrowed. As a result, Cherokee's debt-interest 
costs in the six months that ended Dec. 2 soared to $12.7 million from $20,000 
a year earlier and led to the net loss. 
</P>
<P>
The figures were included in a quarterly financial statement Cherokee filed 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although its stock is no longer 
publicly held, Cherokee must disclose its results because it sold debt 
securities to the public as part of its acquisition.

PUBLIC ENEMY: POWER TO THE MUSIC; 
</P>
<P>
RAP: THE GROUP WAS SENSATIONAL ON A PURELY MUSICAL LEVEL, BUT THE POLITICAL 
SPEECHES WEREN'T QUITE AS GOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Public Enemy, the controversial but acclaimed New York rap group, demands to be 
judged on two score cards -- one for its music and one for its politics. 
</P>
<P>
In the group's first Los Angeles-area appearance since a national furor over 
anti-Semitic remarks by one of its members in a Washington Times interview last 
May, Public Enemy was sensational on a purely musical level Sunday night at the 
Palace in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The most commanding moments of the group's nearly two-hour performance -- most 
notably, a closing barrage of such anthems as "Don't Believe the Hype" and the 
Grammy-nominated "Fight the Power" -- generated in the jammed club the 
emotionally-charged atmosphere associated with the Clash, the rock group that 
was also known for its political fury. On a scale of 100, rate Public Enemy's 
music at the Palace 95. 
</P>
<P>
But the rappers' continuing insistence on having two spokesmen -- a sort of 
good-cop and bad-cop of human relations -- has already caused one major 
incident (the May interview) and represents a time bomb that could well explode 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck D., the group's leader and main rapper, deals in provocative and 
sometimes inflammatory images, but there is usually a sense of poetic vision 
and control behind his impassioned remarks. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in the audience is going to agree with his conclusions about race 
relations in the United States, but he offers arguments that generally deserve 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, group member Professor Griff -- who gave the Washington 
Times interview and has since disavowed the anti-Semitic remarks -- can carry 
on like a loose cannon on stage. 
</P>
<P>
At the Palace (where the group returns tonight), he made sweeping statements 
that ranged from petulant to bizarre -- outbursts against everything from the 
evil media that misrepresents him (shades of Spiro Agnew?) to a theory about an 
AIDS conspiracy against minorities. 
</P>
<P>
As long as this odd couple demands to be judged as a single entry, give Public 
Enemy's politics a cautionary 50. 
</P>
<P>
Headlining a benefit for sickle-cell anemia research on Sunday, Public Enemy 
opened with a nearly 10-minute commentary by Griff before Chuck D. and sidekick 
Flavor Flav came on stage. As usual, members of the S1W security force stood 
behind the rappers, holding imitation Uzis, a symbol of strength and 
determination. 
</P>
<P>
But the real strength is in the torrent of beats delivered by turntable whiz 
Terminator X and the equally compelling verbal assault by Chuck D., who shows 
increased charisma and power as a performer. 
</P>
<P>
Though the group has a new album due in April, the emphasis Sunday was on 
previously released material. But the rappers frequently broke from the music 
as Chuck D., mostly, and Griff delivered speeches. 
</P>
<P>
While many of the calls for increased black consciousness and unity drew 
raised-arm salutes from both whites and blacks in the audience, the most 
spontaneous applause followed Chuck D.'s comments about the evils of drug 
dealing in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
His most provocative remarks came during a pause in "Fight the Power," a song 
featured in Spike Lee's film "Do the Right Thing" and the best single of 1989, 
according to the nation's leading pop critics in a Village Voice poll. 
</P>
<P>
Delivering a lengthy address as he paced back and forth, slapping the 
outstretched hands of fans pressed against the front of the stage, Chuck D. 
explained a line in the song that refers to Elvis Presley and John Wayne as 
racists. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was referring to Presley and Wayne as symbols of white heroes rather 
than attacking the individuals -- references to underscore different cultural 
perceptions of whites and blacks in a land that he sees as overrun by racial 
injustice. 
</P>
<P>
In a comparison that is bound to trigger resentment against the group in a time 
when flag-burning is such an issue in the country, the rapper -- trying to 
further explain the sense of alienation he feels as a black man in the U.S. -- 
said that the American flag has so little meaning to many blacks that it "might 
as well be a swastika." 
</P>
<P>
He followed by describing an interpretation of the red, white and blue: the red 
representing "the blood" shed by blacks, the blue representing the suffering 
that is reflected by the "blues we've been singing the past 400-some odd years" 
and the white representing "the obvious." 
</P>
<P>
At the end, just before fire marshals began clearing the crowded club, Public 
Enemy was joined on stage by Los Angeles rapper Ice-T, who seconded Chuck D.'s 
imagery, declaring that most holidays have little meaning for most blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Public Enemy's mix of music and politics has established the band as the most 
creative force in rap, but it's a risky mix. Chuck D. alone is an artist of Bob 
Marley-like power. The next evidence of how well he handles that power will be 
revealed when Public Enemy's next album, "Fear of a Black Planet," is released 
in April.

Cinematographers Winners: Haskell Wexler's atmospheric camerawork on "Blaze" 
was voted best theatrical release by the American Society of Cinematographers 
Sunday night. Gayne Rescher's work on "Single Women, Married Men" won best 
movie of the week, and a "Murder, She Wrote" episode, "Night of the Tarantula" 
photographed by John Elsenbach, won as a regular series. 
</P>
<P>
The awards, in their fourth year, also gave a lifetime achievement nod to 
Stanley Cortez, whose work ranged from Orson Welles' "The Magnificent 
Ambersons" to "The Three Faces of Eve." Linwood Dunn, visual effects pioneer, 
was given an honorary award for such notable effects as King Kong's swatting at 
planes from the top of the Empire State Building. A first-ever board of 
governors award went to Gregory Peck, cited as a lifetime friend of camera 
operators and the craft of cinematography. SHAUNA SNOW

Cher Dresses for Dinner: Cher has a new video coming out titled "Heart of 
Stone," and this one should generate much less controversy than her "If I Could 
Turn Back Time" video. In the new video -- instead of a skimpy leather strap -- 
she is wearing a black minidress, blazer, stockings and shoes, what has been 
referred to as the kind of outfit one might wear out to dinner. SHAUNA SNOW

'Most Wanted' Suspect Surrenders: A parolee suspected of murder surrendered to 
Los Angeles police early Monday, a few hours after seeing himself on "America's 
Most Wanted." 
</P>
<P>
James Noel, profiled Sunday night on the Fox TV program, walked into the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Central Station at 5:45 a.m. and told officers: "I 
know they're looking for me and I want to turn myself in," LAPD spokesman 
Officer Bill Frio said. Noel, 45, a day laborer, had been on parole for a 
series of robberies and rapes. He was sought in the killing of Wendy Tarr, 18, 
who was shot in the head last Oct. 2 in an apartment building near MacArthur 
Park. SHAUNA SNOW

ICE-T'S MESSAGE BOILS DOWN TO VIOLENCE IN BRUTAL WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For such a controversial guy, Ice-T certainly puts on a pedestrian show. 
Performing Sunday evening in the Cal State Fullerton gym, the L.A.-based rapper 
wouldn't have let down any Parents Music Resource Center monitors in the 
audience: His 13 numbers were chock full of expletives and images of violence 
and crude sex. 
</P>
<P>
Missing from Ice-T's show, however, were most of his more politically based 
material and, more crucially, a sense of spontaneity and engagement in his 
show. 
</P>
<P>
Given that those wanting labels on recordings haven't targeted, say, country 
music (and is there any image in music more chilling than Johnny Cash singing 
"I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die" to an audience of approving 
convicts?), it may be that they're more upset by the way Ice-T and some other 
rappers place their violent street world in a moral perspective, as on Ice-T's 
"This One's for Me": "My homie got a year for an ounce of weed, While Bush 
sells weapons to the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
But except for the taped opening of "Shut Up, Be Happy" -- an ominous vision of 
a brave new world where "the comfort you demanded is now mandatory" -- Ice-T 
and his five-man Rhyme Syndicate Posse stuck to his well-crafted, if thoroughly 
predictable, missives on his superiority with a microphone and his evocations 
of gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
While such numbers as "Drama" and the movie theme "Colors" created a palpable 
sonic and verbal portrait of that brutal world, along with moralizing on the 
futility of such a life, they were undercut in concert by the formulaic 
pre-programmed manner of the show.JIM WASHBURN

OFFICER SUSPENDED FOR SUPPLYING INFORMATION ON DUFFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego police sergeant has been suspended without pay for two weeks and 
stripped of her investigative duties for helping The Times in its reporting 
last year on the unusual private security setup at the home of San Diego County 
Sheriff John Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Anne O'Dell, a 15-year veteran of the Police Department, was disciplined 
after she confirmed for The Times that the sheriff's home alarm system is set 
up for sheriff's deputies to respond to all emergencies, even though Duffy's 
home is within San Diego city limits. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy blamed The Times' articles about his alarm system and a "safe room" in 
the Scripps Ranch house for his surprise decision to drop out of the race for 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
O'Dell, who has filed a formal appeal with the city Civil Service Commission, 
said Monday that she believes that Duffy may have pressured high-ranking Police 
Department officials to punish any police officers who provided information to 
the media about his home. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is stuff going on behind the scenes that I don't have pertinent 
knowledge of, and that disturbs me," she said. "It disturbs me that there 
appears to be a hidden agenda here. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned that the only reason there's a big fuss being made over this is 
because it's Duffy." 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, James Gattey, said he is also concerned that the Police 
Department improperly bowed to pressure from Duffy in disciplining O'Dell. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see any other reason why they were going after her at all," he said. 
"There is nothing to indicate anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy did not return a phone call Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Leroy Brady, who as head of the San Diego police personnel unit approved 
O'Dell's punishment, also could not be reached for comment. But it is Police 
Department policy never to discuss disciplinary action taken against individual 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
O'Dell was working as an investigative sergeant in the Background 
Investigations unit in November when she was contacted by a Times reporter. The 
reporter had been told by several anonymous sources in the Sheriff's Department 
that deputies based in Poway cross city boundaries to respond to emergencies at 
the sheriff's home. 
</P>
<P>
O'Dell was asked by the reporter to check the city permit on Duffy's home alarm 
system to see if calls indeed are relayed to the sheriff's dispatch unit, 
rather than the Police Department. She visited the permit office at police 
headquarters and reported back that the Duffy residence was linked to the 
sheriff's communications unit. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the sheriff's public affairs unit and Duffy publicly acknowledged that 
sheriff's deputies respond to the home alarm system. 
</P>
<P>
O'Dell said she was punished for violating a Municipal Code statute that 
governs what information can be given to the public about private security 
alarm systems. But Gattey, her attorney, said the statute prohibits only the 
release of the alarm company's name and the occupant's name and address. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing in the code that says it is confidential what agency should 
respond to an alarm call," the lawyer said. "Absolutely nothing. And obviously 
that's the problem. The statute doesn't apply here." 
</P>
<P>
The 10-day suspension means that O'Dell will lose about $1,800 in salary, she 
said, adding that she will also lose about $1,000 a year because she was 
removed from her investigative position at headquarters and transferred to a 
field sergeant post in the Northern Division. She said she was also ordered to 
turn in her badge and service weapon during the suspension period, which began 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The sergeant said she hopes to have the suspension overturned by the Civil 
Service Commission, particularly because Police Department policies and 
procedures require that all members "be truthful and cooperate fully with all 
members of the media." 
</P>
<P>
"That's exactly the policy I was following," she added. 
</P>
<P>
O'Dell is the second Times source to come under scrutiny since the newspaper 
exposed irregularities in Duffy's management style. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Sheriff's Sgt. Joe Lopez said he was notified that Internal Affairs 
officers were investigating him on suspicion of leaking information about 
Duffy's home. He said they assumed he was a confidential source for the 
newspaper because he was one of the Poway deputies who responded to the 
sheriff's home on a false burglar alarm call in October and thus would have 
been familiar with Duffy's security system. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez also said he received a formal reprimand for taking down a racist memo 
from the Poway station bulletin board and sending it to the Latino Peace 
Officers Assn. A deputy since 1977, he subsequently was transferred to a night 
shift at the Lemon Grove substation.

STATE FIGHTS DEADLINE FOR REMOVING TOXICS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: CONTAMINATION AT CHATHAM BROTHERS SITE IN ESCONDIDO IS MORE 
WIDESPREAD THAN EARLIER STUDIES SHOWED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
A 9-year-old program to clean up a toxic waste site in southwestern Escondido 
will begin in mid-March as state officials race to move the contaminated soil 
to an approved dump site before stricter federal regulations go into effect in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
Soil tests made in December at the Chatham Brothers Barrel Yard indicate that 
the contamination is more severe and widespread than previously thought, John 
Kearns, regional chief of the Toxic Substances Control Division, part of the 
state Department of Health Services, told residents and community advisory 
board members Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the 400 cubic yards of contaminated materials initially estimated to 
be at the former bulk plant and oil recovery center, about 6,000 cubic yards 
(9,000 tons) of toxic materials must be removed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On May 8, federal regulations will halt dumping of certain untreated toxic 
materials into landfills and require that the soil be treated by "the best 
available technology" -- a costly process of incineration that would raise the 
costs of disposal to about $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
The site, which functioned as a petroleum recycling yard for 40 years, is now 
surrounded by new subdivisions, increasing the possible danger from the toxic 
materials such as heavy metals, PCBs, benzene and other oil derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns said his division has obtained an additional $1 million from the nearly 
bankrupt state "Superfund" for toxic cleanup, enough money to remove the 
remaining contaminated soil. The total cost of the cleanup will be $2.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
When neighbors objected to the sudden start of the program -- without a 30-day 
review period and several public hearings called for in the cleanup plan -- 
Kearns apologized, but pointed out that the removal would take about five 
weeks. That would bring the project to a close by late April or early May, 
before the federal regulations take effect. 
</P>
<P>
"We've reached a time where we've got to stop testing and start acting," John 
Scandura, chief of the site mitigation unit, told the small Escondido audience. 
Further funding will be budgeted starting in June to complete the process by 
restoring the site, he said, a process that will also be subject to public 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
The health department technicians raised their estimates from 400 cubic yards 
to 1,600 cubic yards of contaminated soil on the site after new tests last May, 
and increased the estimate to 6,000 cubic yards following the extensive tests 
done in December. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Baker, project manager, and other health department staff members 
outlined the plans for removal of buried barrels and contaminated soil from the 
site, the safety procedures which will be taken and the findings of the most 
recent tests. The plans have not yet been put in written form, she said, 
because she received the complete results of the December tests only about 10 
days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Residents, who have been complaining about the slow pace of the cleanup, which 
started in 1981, found themselves arguing that the state toxic control 
officials were moving too swiftly. However, most of the community advisory 
board conceded there is no other alternative to the hastily constructed cleanup 
plan if the work is to get done with the money at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary work will probably begin next week, Kearns said, if an approved 
dump site can be found. He said his division is negotiating with two sites, one 
in California and one in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
After two weeks of site preparation, removal will begin. Toxic materials have 
been found at the surface and as deep as 15 feet below ground, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Plans are to use two pieces of earth-moving equipment to move 20 truckloads of 
the contaminated soil out each day. Work would continue six days a week in 
order to speed the removal, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Before work begins, another public hearing is to be held to inform residents 
about the extent of the contamination and the methods of removal. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 cubic yards of the most highly contaminated material from the site 
was removed to a hazardous-waste landfill last year at an estimated cost of 
$200,000. The initial cleanup last spring reduced the hazard of the site 
appreciably, according to a health department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The Chatham family bought the 30-acre site, at Gamble Lane and Bernardo Avenue, 
in 1941 and began operating a bulk petroleum distribution and oil recovery 
processing plant there. In 1948, a still was added to reclaim kerosene and 
hydraulic oil. Solvent reclamation started at the site in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
The property was sold to a housing developer in 1981, the same year the state 
Hazardous Substances Act was passed. The construction firm declared bankruptcy 
a year later and the land reverted back to Robert and Thomas Chatham. 
</P>
<P>
State studies into the severity of the contamination at the Chatham site began 
in 1985.

MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING EX-WIFE WAIVES JURY TRIAL; JUDGE WILL RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Scott Harrison, suspected of murdering his ex-wife, waived a jury trial 
Monday and instead will allow Vista Superior Court Judge David B. Moon Jr. to 
reach his own verdict. The slaying occurred in February, 1988, a month after 
the victim and her new husband won $727,000 in the California Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Alan May said his client decided to put his case to a judge 
because a jury would be tainted by Harrison's criminal record and bad character 
-- elements that, May says, the judge will be better able to segregate from the 
facts of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, 33, who has already been sentenced in federal court for a car 
bombing, arson and an insurance fraud scheme, is charged in the killing of Anne 
Jenkins, who was found dead in her San Marcos home, the victim of strangulation 
and a slashed throat. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office charges that Harrison killed his ex-wife after 
he realized that, given her state lottery winnings, she could better finance 
her court battle against Harrison over the couple's protracted child custody 
and visitation litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, who testified on his own behalf during his preliminary hearing and is 
expected to take the stand again, already admitted that he conducted a nearly 
three-year harassment campaign against Anne Jenkins, her husband, Gary, and her 
father, Harry Wanket. Harrison said he was angry at the three for the 
continuing court battle over the custody and visitation of the two children. 
</P>
<P>
But May says -- and prosecutor Larry Burns acknowledges -- that there is no 
forensic evidence or eyewitness that places Harrison at the murder scene two 
years ago, and that the prosecution is relying on circumstantial evidence and 
Harrison's admitted bad feelings toward Anne Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a whole lot of dispute in the actual facts of the case," May said. 
"But judges have dealt with characters with seedier backgrounds than my client, 
and are not influenced by public opinion, background (of defendants) or 
passion. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a case so cluttered with prior acts and bad character -- but with no 
evidence -- it will take a person with a strong commitment to apply the law. 
When you're innocent and the facts are on your side, I just pray the judge has 
the courage to do what he has to do." 
</P>
<P>
Burns, an assistant U.S. attorney who is prosecuting the case on behalf of the 
district attorney's office because of his previous prosecutions of Harrison, 
said he doesn't object to Moon serving as both judge and jury. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll put on the same case I planned to put before a jury," he said. "And now 
I don't have to worry about one or two jurors hanging up on the case. The 
family (of Anne Jenkins) considers this to be an advantage, that once and for 
all this case will be settled." 
</P>
<P>
Burns added that May "has tried more than 50 murder cases, and he knows what 
he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
May's last murder defense -- in a nonjury trial -- ended with an acquittal in 
December in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The Harrison trial will begin at 1:40 p.m. today with both sides giving opening 
statements to Moon. The case is expected to last 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison already has been sentenced to a 20-year federal prison term because of 
his earlier guilty pleas to arson, insurance fraud and bombing, in which he 
admitted to bombing the van owned by Gary Jenkins' first wife, Pamela Jenkins 
of Vista, in order to cast suspicion on Gary Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison has admitted he also changed the Jenkins' telephone number and both 
the Jenkinses' and Wanket's mailing addresses, as well as buying an 
advertisement in a sex magazine under his father-in-law's name in which he 
solicited homosexual lovers. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Jenkins, 30, was found dead in her home by her husband after she was 
strangled and her throat was slit. There were no signs of a struggle, and 
nothing was taken from the house.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CANTWELL STUDENTS ACT TO KEEP RELIGIOUS 
ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The student body of Cantwell High School in Montebello walked out of class 
Monday to protest a decision by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles to drop the 
contract of the Congregation of Christian Brothers, a religious order that has 
run the boys' school since it opened 43 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
About 230 students left their classes and held a two-hour rally in the 
gymnasium. They asked that Archbishop Roger Mahony visit the school to witness 
the quality of education they receive from the Christian Brothers. Mahony 
announced last week that the Christian Brothers' contract would not be renewed 
and that, beginning in September, 1991, Jesuits would staff the school.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FEE FOR RAZING LOW-COST LODGING ON COAST 
RISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Property owners who want to demolish low-cost lodging in Santa Monica's coastal 
zone, which includes nearly all properties between Ocean Avenue and the beach, 
will have to pay $8,000 per room to do so under a new ordinance recently passed 
by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The fees will go into a fund that would be made available to groups that want 
to develop low-cost lodging in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance defines low-cost lodging as rooms costing less than $80 per 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ken Genser abstained from the discussion and the vote because he is 
employed by American Youth Hostels Inc., which has applied for low-cost lodging 
subsidies in the past. The measure was approved by a 4-2 vote, with council 
members Christine Reed and Herbert Katz voting against it. 
</P>
<P>
The state Coastal Commission, which regulates building in coastal zone areas 
throughout the state, has a $5,000-per-room fee in effect, and gives such fees 
collected within Santa Monica to the city for development of low-cost lodging. 
City Manager John Jalili said the council would have to receive commission 
approval to implement the new fee.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLANS FOR SCHOOL ON SITE OF AMBASSADOR 
ADVANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite competition from developer Donald Trump, the Los Angeles Unified School 
District announced Monday that it intends to go forward with plans to construct 
a high school on the site of the former Ambassador Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
District officials are scheduled to appear before the State Allocation Board in 
Sacramento on Wednesday to seek $120 million to begin construction of a 
2,500-student school on the 24-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
Trump wants to build the world's tallest high-rise on the land and has 
suggested two alternate sites for the school. But both have been rejected by 
district officials because they are in heavy traffic areas and would require 
homes to be torn down. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Monday, school board President Jackie Goldberg accused 
Trump of showing "blatant disregard for the needs of the community." She said 
more than 4,000 students are bused each day from overcrowded schools 
surrounding the Ambassador site to campuses up to an hour away.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAW SOUGHT ON SALES OF ZOO ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A City Council committee voted Monday to draft an ordinance barring the Los 
Angeles Zoo from selling surplus animals to dealers who supply hunting ranches. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was prompted by a television report that the San Diego Zoo and Wild 
Animal Park had sold surplus animals to two dealers who resell them to private 
game farms, where they are shot by hunters for sport. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Zoo Director Warren Thomas told the Arts, Health and Humanities 
Committee Monday that while the zoo has used the two dealers, there is no 
indication that any of the zoo's animals ended up at hunting ranches. Thomas 
said the zoo had checked out both dealers and found them to be "reputable." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Thomas said the Los Angeles Zoo has stopped doing business with 
the dealers, Earl Tatum and Jim Fouts, on orders from Mayor Tom Bradley. The 
dealings may be resumed after the American Assn. of Zoological Parks and 
Aquariums concludes an investigation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joel Wachs, who chairs the committee, said he also wants language 
included in the ordinance that will require better tracking of animals after 
they are sold by the zoo.

VENTURA BOULEVARD REPAIR WORK BEGINS; 
</P>
<P>
ROAD WORK: A SIX-WEEK, $500,000 PROJECT CLOGS TRAFFIC BETWEEN SEPULVEDA AND 
BALBOA BOULEVARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
At 6:30 a.m. Monday, a parade of bulldozers, heavy trucks and traffic control 
officers assembled along a stretch of Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Workers plopped down fluorescent orange cones, blocking off two precious 
traffic lanes. Men wearing hard hats revved up their truck engines and dug the 
claws of their dozers into the asphalt, beginning a six-week road 
reconstruction project along Ventura Boulevard between Sepulveda and Balboa 
boulevards, a two-mile stretch of roadway traveled by 49,000 commuters each 
day. 
</P>
<P>
With the predictable result. 
</P>
<P>
Rush hour drivers near Haskell Avenue were delayed up to 15 minutes, feeder 
streets were clogged, and honking horns blared. 
</P>
<P>
"This is awful, terrible. I should have never left the house," said frustrated 
commuter Betty Bean. 
</P>
<P>
City transportation officials, however, said they expected worse. 
</P>
<P>
With a few more traffic control adjustments, the drive, or more accurately the 
creep along Ventura should improve slightly, said transportation engineer 
Raymond H. Wellbaum. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't as bad as I thought it would be," said Wellbaum, who kept traffic 
vigil on the corner of Ventura and Haskell. 
</P>
<P>
The $500,000 project entails digging up deteriorating portions of the boulevard 
where years of heavy traffic has resulted in cracks, potholes and bumps. A new 
asphalt road base will be poured, and the entire stretch will be resurfaced. 
</P>
<P>
The six-lane boulevard will be reduced to four lanes during most of the 
construction. During the morning rush, three of the lanes are alloted to 
eastbound traffic. Westbound commuters are squeezed into one lane. After 9 
a.m., traffic will be channeled into two lanes in each direction. 
</P>
<P>
The first of three construction phases began Monday with the asphalt removal. 
</P>
<P>
Wellbaum said the biggest problem during morning commute was that cars were 
abruptly channelled from three westbound lanes into one. On Tuesday, barricade 
cones will be spread out over a longer stretch of roadway to allow for smoother 
merges. 
</P>
<P>
The second construction phase, when workers will grind down bumps and other 
irregularities between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., is slated to begin April 16 between 
Sepulveda and Gloria Avenue, followed by work between Gloria and Hayvenhurst 
Avenue and finally between Hayvenhurst and Balboa. 
</P>
<P>
The final phase -- repaving and restriping -- will follow on three consecutive 
Sundays between 3 a.m. and noon. Officials hope to complete the project in 
early May. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an ambitious schedule, but we are going to do everything we can to get 
it done as quickly as possible," said Dennis Harding, general superintendent of 
the division of street maintenance. "We know that traffic is going to be 
horrendous." 
</P>
<P>
Several office workers along the two-mile stretch said they will give 
themselves more time to get to work. A garage attendant said he will try to be 
more cheerful to calm grumbling commuters. 
</P>
<P>
"People were more grouchy this morning," said garage attendant Ramon Reyes. "I 
guess they didn't expect the traffic." 
</P>
<P>
City officials mailed out 10,000 notices warning residents and businesses along 
the two-mile section that traffic lanes would be restricted. 
</P>
<P>
"But you know, people always leave home with just enough time to get to work," 
said Paula Christian, who directed traffic Monday morning at the intersection 
of Haskell and Ventura. "There is a lot of frustration out there."

NO CHARGES YET FILED IN TRAFFIC SHOOTING DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Bail was set at $500,000, but no charges were filed Monday against Howard 
Barton Jr., arrested on suspicion of shooting Marco Anthony Sanchez to death 
after a traffic altercation. 
</P>
<P>
At the arraignment, defense attorney Clyde Munsell presented the deed to a 
Pacific Beach property worth $1 million to cover bail. It was not clear who 
owned the property. Barton was released Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Chappell asked Municipal Judge William H. Woodward to 
continue the case to March 19 because the circumstances are "still under 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Barton, 46, waived his right to a speedy arraignment, and Woodward granted the 
continuation. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense counsel and myself discussed the state of the case and felt that 
the police needed to continue their investigation before a decision (on 
charges) could be made," Chappell said. "It was a mutual thing. The facts 
simply aren't all in, and, until they are, we can't make an intelligent 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
Barton wore a neck brace to the proceeding, but it is not known why. Barton's 
attorney declined to speak to a reporter and did not return a telephone call. 
County Jail records indicate that Barton has received no medical attention 
since he was taken into custody Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Chappell later told reporters that Barton, a La Jolla resident, is not 
considered "a flight risk. And, given the facts as we know them in this case, 
he is not a general risk to the public." 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the incident, which began about 10 a.m. Thursday at Grand Avenue 
and Ingraham Street in Pacific Beach, police said that Sanchez exchanged words 
with Barton's daughter, Andrea, during a traffic dispute. 
</P>
<P>
After Sanchez parked his car in the 1000 block of Garnet Avenue, Andrea Barton 
went to her father's real estate office in the 4900 block of Cass Avenue and 
told him about the altercation. The Bartons drove to Garnet Avenue, where the 
father argued with Sanchez. Barton reportedly shot Sanchez in his car after the 
24-year-old man threatened him with a knife, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez was shot once in the mid-back, on the right side, and the bullet 
traveled to his neck, where it was recovered, Chappell said. Barton had a 
concealed-weapon permit, Chappell added. 
</P>
<P>
Present in the courtroom were Sanchez's mother, sisters, in-laws and wife, 
Gloria Sanchez. Sitting on a bench in the courthouse hallway, Gloria Sanchez 
cried as she thought about her husband, whom she married in June.

CONGRESSMEN HAIL SANDINISTAS' DEFEAT AT POLLS; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: VALLEY-AREA REPRESENTATIVES PRAISE VOTING RESULTS BUT ARE SPLIT ON 
THE CAUSE OF PRESIDENT ORTEGA'S DOWNFALL. 
</P>

<P>
San Fernando Valley-area congressmen who serve on foreign affairs committees 
cheered the surprising electoral defeat of the Sandinistas in Nicaragua on 
Monday and said the United States has a responsibility to supply limited 
foreign aid to the newly elected government. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they voiced concern about the Sandinistas' willingness to 
transfer power peacefully and the ability of the disparate National Opposition 
Union (UNO) led by Violette Barrios de Chamorro to forge an effective 
government and invigorate the faltering economy. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Reps. Howard L. Berman of Panorama City and Anthony C. Beilenson of 
Los Angeles and Republican Reps. Robert J. Lagomarsino of Ojai and Elton 
Gallegly of Simi Valley differed, however, over the causes of the Sandinistas 
apparent demise and who deserves credit for the leftist revolutionaries' 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Berman and Beilenson praised diplomatic efforts. Lagomarsino and Gallegly said 
military and economic pressures were largely responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was in Nicaragua as 
one of the 2,000 accredited election observers. Among other activities, he 
helped count ballots at polling places in the city of Esteli, near the Honduran 
border. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said that although he "didn't trust" Sandinista President Daniel 
Ortega, he was "optimistic he will step down" peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not optimistic," he said, about cooperation by Interior Minister Tomas 
Borge, "a very powerful man and a very feared man." 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said he was amazed at the determination of Nicaraguans to vote in the 
election, even in war-torn areas around Esteli. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them walked as much as 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) and as long as five 
hours" to get to the polls, he said. "Some of them waited in line as long as 
two hours; they were in high spirits and they were calm." 
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted by the outcome and by the opportunities," said Berman, also a 
member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. This includes the possibility of 
a negotiated end to the military conflict in neighboring El Salvador that has 
left 70,000 dead, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We should normalize our relations with the newly elected government" in 
Managua, said Beilenson, who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. 
"We should end as quickly as possible the economic sanctions, which have hurt 
the economy greatly and we should bring an end to this chapter of support for 
the Contras and make arrangements to bring them back home." 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino, the ranking Republican on the Western Hemisphere subcommittee of 
the House Foreign Affairs Committee and a strong supporter of U.S. aid to the 
Contras, called the defeat of Ortega a vindication of hard-line tactics that 
former President Ronald Reagan, Lagomarsino and other conservatives had 
espoused. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it had to do with our policy," Lagomarsino said. "One of the primary 
purposes for Ortega reaching agreement" to hold elections "was to end the 
Contra war." 
</P>
<P>
Berman, in contrast, said President Bush had moved quickly after his 
inauguration in 1989 to end military aid to the Contras as part of a bipartisan 
foreign policy. Beilenson, however, said, "I think the credit mainly goes to 
the other nations of Central America" who had "insisted on this process of 
reconciliation and open elections." 
</P>
<P>
Berman, Beilenson and Lagomarsino roundly criticized the Sandinistas for 
failing to tolerate dissent or political opposition. Lagomarsino said the 
Nicaraguan vote was the latest striking reversal worldwide proving that "people 
don't want to live under Marxist-Leninist systems." 
</P>
<P>
None of the three lawmakers was ready to estimate how much economic assistance 
would be warranted if the Sandinistas permit power to pass to Chamorro and the 
newspaper publisher's allies in April. Nicaragua, whose economy the United 
States helped cripple during the past decade, joins Panama and Eastern European 
nations clamoring for additional foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson said: "We have a certain amount of responsibility in helping these 
people get back on their feet. I hope it's not too much money and it doesn't 
last too long." 
</P>
<P>
All three lawmakers expressed varying degrees of surprise at the outcome. 
Berman, however, said he was "no more surprised that the Soviet Union, after 40 
years of controlling Eastern Europe by military force, would allow those 
countries to evolve on their own." 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson was co-chairman of the official congressional observer delegation 
that disbanded earlier this month after the Sandinistas refused to grant them 
visas. "It came off fine," Beilenson said of the election. "That's all that's 
important."

JUDGE EXPERIENCED IN ABUSE CASES WILL RUN BUCKEY RETRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg, 46, a former deputy district attorney 
and dependency court judge experienced in dealing with child abuse cases, was 
named Monday to preside at the retrial of McMartin Pre-School molestation 
defendant Ray Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
"He is ready to start March 9," said Judge Gary Klausner, supervising judge of 
the Los Angeles Superior Court's central criminal division, in announcing the 
reassignment. He ordered both sides to meet for a "status conference" with 
Weisberg on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The March trial date had been set by Judge William Pounders, who heard the 
record-setting 2 1/2-year trial of Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin 
Buckey, in which they were acquitted of 52 counts of molestation and conspiracy 
last month. However, the jury deadlocked on 13 counts, involving five children, 
against Ray Buckey, and he is being retried on those counts. 
</P>
<P>
Klausner removed Pounders from the case last week on the recommendation of 
Superior Court Judge Michael Hoff, who read arguments from the defense and 
Pounders' reply. Hoff found no evidence that Pounders was biased against either 
Buckey or his attorney, but said he felt that Pounders' post-trial television 
appearances could present problems in selecting a new jury. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge knows what he said and what he meant by his remarks, but would be 
placed in the impossible position of interpreting what the prospective juror 
thought about those remarks and perhaps the judge himself," Hoff found. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Danny Davis said Monday that he has "personal plans" that may 
delay the trial, and that, while a change of venue is "unlikely," jury 
selection could be time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm troubled," he said, by the possibility that prosecutors may be creating "a 
false event," in the form of the retrial, for political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
(Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner is a candidate for state attorney general). 
</P>
<P>
"I sense the (post-trial) publicity developed a kind of heated energy," Davis 
said, noting that only a handful of counts remain and that he believes that "no 
child witness is committed and available to go forward at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said Reiner had better "be certain he is going to best me at trial." 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorney said he does not know much about Weisberg. 
</P>
<P>
"The trial is a tar baby for anyone" who touches it, Davis said. "I hope he'll 
bring a measure of objectivity and fairness" to the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Attys. Joe Martinez and Pamela Ferrero, the two new prosecutors, 
made no comment on the selection of Weisberg. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a sheet metal worker, Weisberg was born in East Los Angeles and 
attended law school at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
He spent 18 years as a Los Angeles County prosecutor, handling such 
high-profile cases as the successful prosecution of Marvin Pancoast for murder 
in the slaying of Vicky Morgan, the mistress of business tycoon Alfred 
Bloomingdale. 
</P>
<P>
He was appointed to the Municipal Court bench by Gov. George Deukmejian in 
1986, and elevated to the Superior Court in 1988. He is considered intellectual 
and efficient. 
</P>
<P>
A deputy county counsel who appeared before him during his one-year stint in 
the juvenile division remembers Weisberg as "compassionate." 
</P>
<P>
"He is not a demonstrative man, but he had a lot of sympathy for children whose 
lot in life is pretty grim," she said. "He was willing to listen to kids and 
give them credibility and what they needed. He genuinely tried to help out 
children." 
</P>
<P>
Weisberg married Superior Court Judge Jacqueline Levit Weisberg in 1985.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN MARCOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A car show was shut down by San Marcos officials Sunday when a large group of 
spectators became rowdy. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Rick Gittings said a shopping center parking lot at San Marcos 
Boulevard and Pacific Street was too small to accommodate the crowd, which 
overflowed onto the streets and created traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County Sheriff's Department estimated the crowd at 6,000 
spectators, including gang members from Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San 
Diego. There were no arrests or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Gittings said there were people with open containers of alcohol, which is 
prohibited by the city. A fight also broke out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The promoter never envisioned that that many people would show up," Gittings 
said. "He was too successful in his promotion. The event just got out of hand. 
People parked illegally on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Gittings said that Louis Garcia came to his office late Friday and requested 
permission to hold the second California Vehicle Art Show, but the request was 
denied. A city permit was not required for Garcia to hold the show at the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said the American Red Cross was co-sponsoring the event, according to 
Gittings. 
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for the Red Cross, Tom Custer, denied any involvement with 
the promoter.

Efforts to hire more ethnic minority professors by the San Diego Community 
College District have gained the district a special award from the statewide 
community college Board of Governors. 
</P>
<P>
The "Outstanding Achievement Award" results from 30 of 63 new faculty for 
1989-90 school year being from under-represented minorities. 
</P>
<P>
District Chancellor J. William Wenrich made it his goal to fill half of the 
vacant faculty positions with ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
In comments to the Times last summer, Wenrich said his commitment "is to ensure 
that the staff more closely reflects the student population and the community 
served." 
</P>
<P>
Among other actions, the district sent recruitment teams across the nation, 
advertised widely in national publications and trade journals, set up a 
toll-free number for potential applications, and encouraged its own faculty to 
make recommendations and talk to colleagues at other institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The district also established an internship under which promising applicants 
without sufficient teaching experience can work alongside full-time faculty. 
</P>
<P>
Wenrich said his 50% goal remains during the recruiting drive to fill 80 
positions for the 1990-91 academic year.

FIRMS ACCUSED OF DUMPING TAINTED SOIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Atty. James Hahn on Monday accused three companies of 
involvement in illegal dumping of gasoline-soaked soil at the Bradley Landfill 
in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's office brought a criminal complaint against Unocal Corp. and two 
Paramount-based companies, L. Blain Co. and Hawkeye Equipment Co. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal hired the other two firms to remove a leaking gasoline storage tank from 
one of its service stations in Pacoima and to excavate the contaminated soil 
around it. 
</P>
<P>
On June 6, a driver for Hawkeye was caught at the privately owned Bradley 
Landfill, seeking to unload a truckload of gasoline-soaked dirt from the 
service station site, according to Hahn's office. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkeye and L. Blain Co. were accused of one count each of knowingly 
transporting hazardous waste to a landfill not licensed to accept such material 
and of attempting to dispose of such waste at an improper site. Each count is 
punishable by a fine of up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal also was accused of failing to determine whether the waste was hazardous 
and of failing to prepare a hazardous-waste manifest before transporting the 
material, Hahn's office said. Arraignment is set for April 23 in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SOCKERS' QUINN, SEGOTA TO MISS TRIP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As if things weren't bad enough for the slumping Sockers (14-20), midfielders 
Brian Quinn and Branko Segota won't make the trip for Wednesday's game with the 
Dallas Sidekicks, Socker President Ron Cady said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Segota, who may be out as long as two weeks, suffered a groin strain during 
Saturday's 6-1 loss to St. Louis, and Quinn is still recovering from a groin 
injury suffered more than a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting used to bad news now," said Socker Coach Ron Newman, who said 
forwards Steve Zungul (arthritic hips) and Damir Haramina (right hamstring) 
will also not make the trip. "I'm just taking every player that's left." DON

AFTER SIX YEARS, MT. CARMEL, HENRY BATTLE AGAIN

<P>
When Mt. Carmel and Patrick Henry play tonight at Mira Mesa High (7:30) in the 
boys' Division I semifinals it will be their first meeting in six years. 
</P>
<P>
Although that's a long time, Mt. Carmel Coach John Marincovich didn't seem to 
have a problem recalling the details. 
</P>
<P>
"They beat us by one in the semifinals," he said with a bit of frustration in 
his voice. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry Coach Fritz Ziegenfuss' memory wasn't as sharp. 
</P>
<P>
"Did we play them then?" Ziegenfuss asked. "Maybe we did, but I think it was in 
the quarters." 
</P>
<P>
With Patrick Henry (23-4) and Mt. Carmel (22-5) both playing their best 
basketball of the season, tonight's game figures to be as close and maybe a bit 
more memorable. 
</P>
<P>
Marincovich said the game will be decided inside. 
</P>
<P>
"This game is going to be determined by the boards," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If that's the case, Mt. Carmel has the size advantage with Shane Knight, 
6-foot-9 going against Dan Kotnik (6-4) and John Pike (6-4) inside. Knight 
pulled down 13 rebounds in Mt. Carmel's 76-56 quarterfinal victory over Poway. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very worried about Shane Knight," Ziegenfuss said. 
</P>
<P>
Marincovich is worried, but not about one particular player. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a very solid club," he said. "They don't have one great player, but a 
lot of good ones. You can't sag on one guy." 
</P>
<P>
And although Knight is Mt. Carmel's marquee player, averaging 20 points a game, 
the Sundevils can also beat you with other people. As a team they are shooting 
57% from the floor and all five starters are hitting better than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
* In the other Division I semifinal, San Diego will attempt to avenge a 56-54 
heartbreaker to Sweetwater (27-1), which occurred in the finals of Sweetwater's 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater's Mendel Nafarette was the hero in that one, hitting a layup at the 
buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, San Diego was ranked second in the county and Sweetwater was 
fifth. The roles are a bit reversed now as Sweetwater is seeded first and San 
Diego (19-4) fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"We've both improved tremendously since then, but that gave us a big mental 
boost at the time," Sweetwater Coach David Ybarra said. 
</P>
<P>
Ybarra said his biggest problem should be coping with hot-shooting San Diego 
forward Clark James, who has scored 32 and 41 points in his two playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely on a hot streak," Ybarra said. "He's going to get his points, 
but we're going to make him work." 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater is led by the tandem of Joe Campbell and Carlos Campbell, who 
averaged 21.1 and 19.8 points a game during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
* The Division I girl's semifinals will be played before the boys' games at 
5:30. Rancho Buena Vista (21-6) meets Santana (23-4) at Serra and Mt. Carmel 
(20-5) plays Poway (21-4) at Mira Mesa in the fifth meeting of the teams this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Poway has won three of the four meetings, although Mt. Carmel took the last 
game, 54-48, after being down 25-7 early. The Sundevils, who also met Poway in 
the finals of their own tournament and the second round of the Kiwanis 
tournament, lost the three games by a total of 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I think both coaches had hoped the fifth game would take place in the finals 
instead of the semifinals," Mt. Carmel Coach Peggy Brose said. "It should be an 
emotional game, because it's a cross-town rivalry and most of these kids have 
been playing together since the sixth grade." 
</P>
<P>
Although Brose said her team has overachieved to reach the semifinals, a fourth 
loss to Poway would be difficult to take. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be hard to finish the season with six losses and four of those were 
to one team," Brose said. 
</P>
<P>
If Mt. Carmel wins, it would be its fifth semifinal trip in the last seven 
years. The other two years the Sundevils reached the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
* The division III girls' and boys' semifinals will also be held tonight at 
Torrey Pines and San Dieguito High Schools beginning at 5:30.

CENTER OFFERS MIXED PLATE SO FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the downtown restaurant industry has been licking its chops in 
anticipation of extra business from the newly opened San Diego Convention 
Center, industry analysts believe the fate of most restaurants will be 
determined by how well they attract local patrons. 
</P>
<P>
Observers say it is too early to know how the Convention Center will affect the 
restaurant industry. The center's first two months of business have elicited 
mixed reviews from local restaurateurs. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Convention Center has had "a positive effect, and most 
restaurateurs feel it's doing them some good," said Paul McIntyre, executive 
director of the San Diego Restaurant Assn. "But, when you get down to asking 
for numbers, the reviews are too mixed to put a count on it. In the opinion of 
many restaurateurs, there has been too much anticipation of how much business 
will be provided by the Convention Center and how many restaurants can be 
supported by it." 
</P>
<P>
Some restaurateurs have noted an increase in business during some of the 
recently scheduled trade shows and conventions, which have attracted an 
estimated 50,000 out-of-town visitors since it opened in early January. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the opening, business has been exceptional," said Salvatore Gangale 
owner of Salvatore's, an Italian restaurant that opened more than two years ago 
on Front Street in downtown San Diego. Gangale said business was so good during 
one convention last week that he ran out of tables and had to turn away 
patrons. 
</P>
<P>
But not every restaurant can expect to benefit equally from every convention, 
experts say. The style, tastes and income level of Convention Center visitors 
will determine which restaurants fill up and which close early. 
</P>
<P>
Lubach's, an upscale, continental-style restaurant on North Harbor Drive, 
seated many conventioneers in mid-February during a convention for the National 
Assn. of Secondary School Principals, but it didn't serve a single patron from 
the Action Sports Retailer trade show two weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"Not every type of group is going to be my type of clientele," said Bob Lubach, 
who now runs the restaurant his father opened 34 years ago. "You're not going 
to generate revenue out of every group that comes to San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Although analysts say restaurants as far away as University City might attract 
Convention Center business, the center will have the biggest impact on the 
downtown Gaslamp Quarter, which has been the focus of intense redevelopment 
during the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, the number of Gaslamp Quarter eateries, ranging from fast-food 
outlets to trendy full-service restaurants, has nearly doubled to 50, said 
Louise Miesfeld, marketing director of the Gaslamp Quarter Merchants Assn. 
During a one-week period last December, four new restaurants opened in the 
Gaslamp. 
</P>
<P>
The openings have been exciting to local palates in search of exotic tastes, 
but they have also been troubling to established restaurateurs competing for a 
limited number of patrons. 
</P>
<P>
"The perception I have from the restaurant people this year is that this has 
been a tough year in the restaurant business because of the tremendous growth 
in the restaurant industry," said San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau 
spokesman Al Reese. "The growth in restaurants has been pretty rapid, and more 
rapid than the growth in visitors this year. There just hasn't been enough . . 
. growth in patronage." 
</P>
<P>
That conclusion is supported in a study released last week by the accounting 
and consulting firm of Laventhol &amp; Horwath. According to the study, while 
food and beverage sales in restaurants throughout the city of San Diego 
increased 9% between 1987 and 1988, average sales per outlet increased only 3% 
over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is sales per outlet is good, but it hasn't grown a lot more 
than the inflation rate," said Todd Wynne-Parry, a restaurant and food service 
consultant for Laventhol &amp; Horwath. "But, when we get information from 1988 
to 1989, I think we'll see strong growth." 
</P>
<P>
Restaurateurs who want to make the most of Convention Center traffic can pay a 
fee to advertise on a classy restaurant kiosk set up at the entrance to the 
center. Reidy O'Neil's, a new restaurant and bar in the heart of the Gaslamp, 
is among more than 50 restaurants that so far have taken advantage of the 
kiosk. Larry Moss, the restaurant's managing partner, said business booms when 
a convention is in town. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Gaslamp's future won't be determined solely by the Convention 
Center, experts say. Equally important are redevelopment efforts that observers 
believe will increase the downtown population and turn the area into a bustling 
nighttime entertainment center rivaling New Orleans' French Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
However, the financial health of downtown businesses could be hurt by poor 
lighting and state laws that restrict amplified music and the amount of alcohol 
revenue a downtown restaurant can earn, said Michael McDade, a San Diego 
attorney who chairs the Gaslamp Quarter Council, a merchant planning group. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown restaurateurs have complained that the music ordinances, which cause 
problems for establishments with entertainment, interfere with their ability to 
attract patrons. In December, city officials agreed to issue special permits to 
downtown restaurants that hoped to circumvent an ordinance prohibiting them 
from serving more alcohol than food. But the state Alcoholic Beverage Control 
Department has been citing some restaurateurs for violating the music 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Still, most restaurateurs who opened their doors before the restrictions were 
lifted and who struggled to pay their bills while the Convention Center was 
being built remain optimistic that the center will attract patrons to the 
Gaslamp Quarter and eventually boost business. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody realizes that it's not a gravy train, but from what I've 
seen so far, it's going to be a positive," said Chuck Kovar, co-owner of 2 
1/2-year-old Cabo Cabo Grill and Hotel Bar downtown. "You still have to be 
good. You still have to show up at work and do a good job. Reputation is 
something you have to earn and keep. . . . I don't think the Convention Center 
is a quick fix for a bad operator."

ICA STOCK VALUE IS BIG QUESTION AFTER SEIZURE; 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;LS: DELISTING BY THE NYSE, BANKRUPTCY AND MORE SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS COULD 
BE IN THE OFFING.

<P>
The seizure of financially troubled Imperial Savings Assn. by federal 
regulators signaled the start of hard times for Imperial Corp. of America, the 
thrift's publicly traded parent company. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial, one of 11 S&amp;Ls seized nationwide Friday, was the largest 
financial institution ever to fail in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators are now operating Imperial Savings' 88 branch offices 
throughout the state. With the thrift, by far ICA's largest asset, now under 
federal control, "the question is what value there is left in ICA," said Irving 
Katz, director of research for Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. "The stock 
seems certain to be delisted" by the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market Monday provided a partial answer to the question of ICA's 
value: The stock that has traded for months at $.50 or less closed down $.375 
at $.1875. 
</P>
<P>
"Stockholders might want to paper their walls with the stock certificates," 
Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
But the question of ICA's value is not a moot point, because the stock could 
continue to trade on an over-the-counter basis, Katz said. However, "at this 
point, the commission you'd be charged to sell the stock is more than you'd be 
able to get for it," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
The government takeover of Imperial Savings could force ICA to file for 
bankruptcy, as other S&amp;L holding companies have after federal regulators 
seized their S&amp;L assets. 
</P>
<P>
The failure seems likely to generate additional shareholder lawsuits against 
the holding company's board of directors, observers said. One shareholder 
complained Friday that ICA's board members "were supposed to be a group of 
outsiders with fiduciary responsibility . . . (but) they turned out to be 
pretty much a bunch of dumbos." 
</P>
<P>
It was uncertain Monday what Imperial's failure means for Caywood-Christian 
Capital Management, an ICA subsidiary that managed Imperial's junk bond 
portfolio as well as portfolios owned by other companies. ICA owns a 49% stake 
in the La Jolla-based investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial's failure "really has no bearing on the people we're doing business 
with," Caywood-Christian spokesman Mike McNelley said. "We've been doing 
business all day today, and (the failure) will have no effect on our daily 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
The seizure also raised questions about the eventual fate of Imperial Savings, 
which is being operated by the federal Resolution Trust Corp., which disposes 
of failed S&amp;Ls and banks. While federal regulators hope to sell all or part 
of the S&amp;L business, "there are already a number of institutions up for 
sale, and you're not seeing a long line of investors lining up to buy them," 
said Joseph Jolson, an S&amp;L industry analyst with Montgomery Securities in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Imperial, from a retail standpoint, has some good branches, they're decent in 
San Diego and OK in Los Angeles and San Francisco," Jolson said. "They're an 
operation that some people should be interested in." 
</P>
<P>
But Jolson and other analysts questioned when Resolution Trust would actually 
sell all or part of Imperial. "There are interested buyers for Gibraltar 
(Savings &amp; Loan, which failed last year), but it hasn't been sold because 
RTC can't get its act together," Jolson said. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Savings' value will "tend to deteriorate the longer it takes to make a 
sale," he said. "That means the (government) will get a lesser price, and that 
ultimately increases the price to the taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its troubled junk bond and consumer loan portfolios, Jolson said, 
Imperial "is not going to be one of the 'black hole' kinds of situations," such 
as the failed S&amp;Ls and banks in Texas that will cost billions of dollars to 
dispose of.

THE DELOREAN: A COMEBACK FOR THE FUTURE?; 
</P>
<P>
CARS: THE CO-OWNER OF A CANOGA PARK SHOP THAT REPAIRS AND RESTORES DELOREANS 
WANTS TO HAVE THE LAST LAUGH ON THOSE WHO DOUBTED THE VALUE OF THE STAINLESS 
STEEL, GULL-WINGED SPORTS CAR. 
</P>

<P>
Owners of DeLorean sports cars are used to being razzed. After the DeLorean 
became known as the "cocaine car" in the early 1980s when creator John Z. 
DeLorean was indicted on drug charges (he was later acquitted), DeLorean owners 
say drivers in other cars would grin at them and put their fingers to their 
noses, mimicking cocaine users. 
</P>
<P>
The embarrassing moments for DeLorean's company were legion, such as the time 
Johnny Carson, an investor in DeLorean Motor Co., drove a DeLorean in front of 
a crowd of fans during a promotional outing, only to have the engine stall. 
</P>
<P>
But Edward R. Bernstein wants "the last laugh on everyone that made fun of the 
owners when they bought the cars." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein is co-owner of DeLorean One, a 4-year-old Canoga Park company that 
repairs and restores DeLoreans and sells DeLorean parts. Bernstein says his 
company is profitable and will rack up about $2 million in sales this year, as 
one of the biggest DeLorean parts and repair outfits in the country. About half 
his volume will come from sales of more than 2,700 parts and accessories -- 
from 97-cent nuts to $1,777 stainless steel doors. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein contends the car's image is on the mend, thanks in part to the 
popular "Back to the Future" movies, which featured DeLoreans souped up into 
time-traveling vehicles. And because the car is about 10 years old and 
relatively rare, Bernstein is betting that DeLoreans will become prized by 
investment-minded car buffs who will use his services to keep their cars in 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, say the car might be more like an Edsel than a Ferrari. "I 
wouldn't put my hard-earned money into it as an investment," said Rick Cole of 
Rick Cole Auctions, a North Hollywood seller of exotic cars. "The car was not 
very well made, it was underpowered and had problems in . . . air conditioning. 
From a serious collector's standpoint, there's absolutely no collectibility." 
</P>
<P>
Still, when the first DeLorean car rolled out of a factory in Northern Ireland 
10 years ago, many people were impressed. The stainless steel sports coupe with 
gull-winged doors that open up instead of out was the long-awaited creation of 
former General Motors maverick DeLorean. 
</P>
<P>
The car was sleek and stylish and carried the stamp of Detroit's former golden 
boy, whose former wife, fashion model Cristina Ferrare, helped support him 
while DeLorean was starting the company. The British government would invest 
more than $150 million in DeLorean Motor. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to build a car that would last, that had the quality of 
eternity," DeLorean said last week in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
But DeLorean's dream had a short life span. The first car was produced in 1980 
with a sticker price of $26,000. But soon DeLorean's personal life became 
tabloid fodder. He was arrested in October, 1982, after he allegedly tried to 
sell $24 million in cocaine to federal agents who were posing as drug dealers. 
That same day, the British government closed the DeLorean car plant. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, a jury found DeLorean not guilty of all drug-related charges after a 
sensational seven-month trial in which his lawyers accused federal agents of 
entrapment. In 1985, a federal indictment charged him with bilking investors in 
his company through fraud and racketeering, but a jury cleared him of the 
charges in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
By then DeLorean Motor was history. It filed for bankruptcy protection in 1982 
and was later liquidated. Only 8,583 of the two-seat cars were made. 
</P>
<P>
"Political problems led to its demise," DeLorean said of his company. 
</P>
<P>
But in books, such as "Hard Driving, My Years With John DeLorean," by William 
Haddad, a former DeLorean Motor executive, and "Grand Delusions, the Cosmic 
Career of John DeLorean," by Hillel Levin, the company's collapse was blamed on 
DeLorean's unrealistic sales goals and his refusal to slow production when 
mechanical and production problems surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also complained that the car lacked some of the promised safety 
features, such as air bags, and was plagued by mechanical foul-ups, such as a 
faulty mechanism in the gull-winged doors, which sometimes left drivers trapped 
inside their cars. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, today the DeLorean has developed an almost cult-like following. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who love them really love them, which is probably more than enough 
to keep a company like that going," Jack R. Nerad, editor of Motor Trend 
magazine, said of DeLorean One. Marvin Katz, vice president of Kapac Inc., the 
Columbus, Ohio, auto parts company that bought the DeLorean inventory when the 
company was liquidated said the cars have shown surprising resilience: "There 
are very few problems with them." 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, it's the DeLorean's style that owners say they love. "If 
you want a fast car, buy a Porsche or a Ferrari," said Bernstein, who bought a 
DeLorean when they first came out, smitten with its design. The initial design 
was by an Italian firm that also designed cars for Maserati and Alfa Romeo. 
</P>
<P>
Don Steger, co-owner of the DeLorean Motor Center, a DeLorean service facility 
in Garden Grove, had a procession of 16 DeLoreans waiting outside the church 
where he was married. After he deposited his bride inside his car and shut the 
gull-winged door, the other car doors were lowered in sequence. 
</P>
<P>
DeLorean told of one owner who was so infatuated with his car that he arranged 
to be buried in it when he died. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein said these enamored owners provide him with a bustling business. "On 
any given day, we have 17 to 28 DeLoreans in the shop," he said. Bernstein 
markets his merchandise through a catalogue that he mails to 7,000 DeLorean 
owners. The rest of the firm's business comes from fixing the cars at a shop 
Bernstein runs in Canoga Park and another shop in Houston, where Bernstein's 
partner Stephen Wynne is based. 
</P>
<P>
DeLorean One isn't the only company specializing in DeLoreans. Katz said about 
90 dealers offer DeLorean parts and service, including DeLorean Motor Center 
and DeLorean Motor Club of America in Huntington Beach, both of which were 
started by former DeLorean Motor employees. 
</P>
<P>
The DeLorean was actually a compilation of parts made by other car companies. 
The DeLorean motor, for instance, was made by the French auto maker Renault, 
while the heating and air conditioning systems were made by a division of 
General Motors. Katz said he has about $23 million of DeLorean inventory left, 
which he estimated would last another 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein buys many of his parts from Katz, the rest directly from the original 
manufacturers. Because he has developed relationships with these manufacturers, 
Bernstein said, "we will fill the void" when Kapac has run out of inventory. 
</P>
<P>
That will come in handy if the DeLorean achieves status as a true collectible. 
But if DeLoreans are becoming a hot commodity, it has not shown in prices yet. 
The cars sell for $10,000 to $26,000, depending on the model year and 
condition, according to Cars of Particular Interest, a quarterly price listing 
of collectible cars. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis McCune of Woodland Hills said he's trying to sell his DeLorean for 
$19,000. McCune said when he bought the car in 1981 he thought it would be a 
good investment. "I'm giving up on that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dave Campbell, co-owner of Harry Kaufman Motorcars in Milwaukee, which has 
sold 200 DeLoreans, said it is just a matter of time. "I'm 100% sure the 
DeLorean will be a good collectible someday," he said, adding that rare or 
unusual cars usually start jumping in price when they reach the age of 15. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, but the Bricklin, another gull-winged sports car that was built in 
Canada in the mid-'70s by Malcolm Bricklin, another auto industry star, has yet 
to become a valuable collectible. About 3,000 Bricklins were made; they now 
sell for about $10,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Wynne asserted, "We've got years of business ahead of us." 
</P>
<P>
DeLorean One is actually a second career for Bernstein, 51, who owned four Red 
Carpet Realty brokerages in Los Angeles before selling out in 1983. Bernstein 
planned to retire and spend his days lying by his pool and polishing his 
DeLorean. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1985, Bernstein was driving on the freeway when his transmission went 
out. He called an exotic car repair shop in Canoga Park owned by Wynne and was 
so impressed with the service he received that the two started a repair and 
parts business devoted exclusively to DeLoreans. Wynne, 33, later moved to 
Houston, where there is a high concentration of DeLorean owners, to oversee 
that operation, while Bernstein oversees the DeLorean repair shop in Canoga 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, John DeLorean, 65, lives in New York and is working on what he says 
is a new "super-exotic, limited production, fast and expensive" car that he 
hopes to build in Germany. But he's been talking about starting another sports 
car company for several years now.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: FIRMS TO SELL INTEREST IN 31 HOTELS FOR $185.8 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hotel Investors Trust, a real estate investment trust based in Woodland Hills, 
and Hotel Investors Corp., a San Diego hotel management company, said they 
agreed to sell their interest in 31 hotels for $185.8 million to Park Plaza 
Inc., an affiliate of EIE International Corp. of Japan. The trust and the 
corporation, whose shares are paired and trade on the New York Stock Exchange, 
have been stung by declining profits and previously announced plans to sell 
their 36 hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Completion of the sale is subject to certain conditions, such as inspection of 
the properties, market studies, analysis of financial information, an opinion 
from Hotel Investors' adviser, Salomon Brothers Inc., that the deal is fair, 
approval by shareholders of Hotel Investors and government clearances. 
</P>
<P>
The Hotel Investors trust and corporation also said they are continuing to look 
for buyers of their two casino properties in Las Vegas.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: NEW IMAGE SEEKS TO OFFER 1.1 MILLION SHARES OF STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Image Industries Inc. of Canoga Park said it filed a registration statement 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an offering of 1.1 million 
shares of its common stock. Of the shares being offered, 1 million are being 
offered by the company, and 100,000 are being offered by shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said he could not project the amount of money New Image 
will net, since the price of the stock could change before the offering becomes 
effective in late March. 
</P>
<P>
New Image's stock trades at about $12.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
New Image markets computer systems used by hairstylists, builders, cosmetic 
surgeons and weight-loss clinics to show clients before-and-after pictures. The 
company said proceeds from the offering will be used to open regional 
headquarters in Europe, to develop new products and possibly to finance future 
acquisitions.

RISK OF TRUTH IN 'REBEL ARMIES'; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: MARK LEE'S DRAMA DRAWS HEAVILY FROM HIS EXPERIENCES IN AFRICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The job of the journalist, like that of a witness on the stand, is to tell the 
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. 
</P>
<P>
But what if telling the truth claims innocent lives? What is a fact weighed in 
balance with life and death? 
</P>
<P>
That is the question posed by Mark Lee's "Rebel Armies Deep Into Chad," having 
its West Coast premiere Saturday at the Old Globe Theatre's Cassius Carter 
Centre Stage. 
</P>
<P>
It is a question that matters deeply to Lee, who filed news reports as a 
correspondent in war-torn Uganda from 1980 to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Lee, a Minneapolis native now living in Los Angeles, said he doesn't believe 
that anything he wrote contributed to anyone's death. But the idea that he 
might slip and inadvertently endanger one of his sources was constantly on his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were seen talking to someone in the marketplace, that person could be 
picked up and shot," Lee said in an interview at the Old Globe, shortly before 
a recent rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
"What is autobiographical is that I was always scared that, through an accident 
of my own, I would cause someone to die. The responsibility of a journalist -- 
What are you going to report? What are you going to do to ascertain the truth? 
-- worried me the whole time as a constant psychological presence. What do you 
do if you're alone? And I was alone." (For a full year, Lee said, he was the 
only Western journalist working in Uganda.) 
</P>
<P>
It was his very interest in such life-and-death issues that sent him to Africa 
in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
When Lee, now 38, studied at Yale, his most influential teacher was Pulitzer 
Prize-winning writer Robert Penn Warren (named the first poet laureate of the 
United States in 1986), to whom he dedicates "Rebel Armies." Lee credits Warren 
with encouraging him to think about the "big questions." 
</P>
<P>
After graduation in 1973, Lee considered and rejected law school, then turned 
to various jobs -- taxi driver, security guard, hawker of "little green things 
that glow in the dark" -- all while he wrote poetry and short stories and 
explored the New York literary scene. 
</P>
<P>
But the smug insularity of that life made him uncomfortable. While living in 
Rome in the late '70s, he read about the civil war in Ethiopia's Eritrean 
region and decided to acquire press credentials -- originally from the Pacific 
News Service in San Francisco because he had no journalism experience and that 
organization "would give credentials to anyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that these people in Ethiopia were sacrificing their life for 
something they believed in was exciting for me because I think I was used to 
people in the New York literary scene who were worried about where their next 
grant was coming from," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
"I passed through Nairobi and met the United Press bureau chief and tried to 
interest him in letting me write for him. He told me I should go to Kampala, 
Uganda, because there were only two stringers there and they were about to be 
thrown out of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Once there, he found out why stringers didn't last very long in Uganda -- all 
you had to do to be expelled was write a story about the frequent government 
atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
Lee bought time in Uganda by turning down an offer to write for BBC radio and 
sticking to print journalism (government officials listened to the radio, but 
didn't bother to catch his stories in foreign newspapers, he learned). 
</P>
<P>
He also was indirectly helped by his editors overseas, who did not think 
killings in Kampala were worthy of big play. 
</P>
<P>
"Eighty percent of my work was spiked," Lee said. "They didn't want massacre 
stories." 
</P>
<P>
The two stories he wrote that made the biggest splash were about elephant 
poaching and the Kampala golf course, where golfers had to make their putts 
near unexploded grenades. 
</P>
<P>
"One hundred thousand people were being killed and they give all the play to 
elephant poaching," said Lee, shaking his head. "I think we have too much news 
today and it's easy to become desensitized to the horrors of the Third World. I 
think the point of writing plays is that they can make people realize there are 
human beings behind the headlines in Asia and Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Lee wrote a massacre story that got him expelled. He went to a 
village north of Kampala where government troops forced all 27 of the village 
men to dig a pit in a sorghum field, then slashed their throats and pushed them 
in the hole. 
</P>
<P>
Lee found two men who survived by pretending death; he tied one badly injured 
man on his back and rode him via motorcycle to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government didn't hear of the story, which he sent to Associated 
Press, United Press International and Reuters news services, and several 
foreign papers, until it was noticed by Amnesty International, which lodged a 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
After a tense three days of governmental scrutiny that led to his expulsion in 
1982, Lee was offered a position in Beirut by the London Daily Telegraph, but 
turned it down because he wanted to be a fiction writer. 
</P>
<P>
Once he was back in the United States, Lee said, he tried to write about Africa 
and couldn't because the subject was still too painful. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, one of the first things he did when he returned to New York in 1984 
was propose to his wife, Therese Lee (now an AP correspondent in Los Angeles), 
while they stood in the head of the Statue of Liberty -- a symbol he said, of 
how glad he was to be back home. 
</P>
<P>
He tried to capture his African experience in novels (He has three unpublished 
ones in a closet, where, he said, he intends to keep them.). 
</P>
<P>
He then turned to playwriting. But even then, he could not deal with Uganda 
directly at first. 
</P>
<P>
His first play, "California Dog Fight" centered on the violence of illegal 
pit-bull fights, with actual dogs on stage. 
</P>
<P>
It played in New York's Manhattan Theatre Club in 1985, in Los Angeles and in 
London, where it was named the best new play of the year by the London Tribune. 
Lee said the one thing it taught him -- besides the fact that he liked to write 
plays -- was never again to write a script with an animal in it. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter if you have Olivier on stage with a cat. The people will 
watch the cat because you never know what a cat is going to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He now has several plays to his credit including "Paradise," a story about 
Hollywood that was included in the Old Globe Theatre's Play Discovery Series 
last year, and "Pirates," a fantasy about historic female pirates that won the 
South Coast Repertory Theatre's second annual California Playwrights 
Competition. 
</P>
<P>
Lee picked up a $5,000 prize for "Pirates," which will be presented as part of 
SCR's California Play Festival this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Lee began writing "Rebel Armies" in 1986. He mixed what did happen with what 
might have happened in a story about two journalists and two prostitutes that 
he described as "emotionally" -- though not literally -- true. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very painful to write this play," he said quietly. He did 15 drafts 
before its successful run at Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Conn., in 1989. 
The play will be presented later this year by the Bristol Old Vic in London. 
</P>
<P>
Lee still writes poetry and is working on a screenplay for HBO, "Honorary 
White," set in South Africa, and a teleplay for CBS called "A Nation Under 
Siege," set in San Diego, that poses the question of what would happen if the 
army came into cities to fight the drug war. 
</P>
<P>
"A Nation Under Siege" is scheduled to be filmed in the summer and aired in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
The subject matter in Lee's body of work may seem disparate, but they all have 
something important in common, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In every single one of my plays, people make a decision," he said. "Sometimes 
not the right one, but they make a moral decision. 
</P>
<P>
"They are all about people taking responsibility for their lives. These days 
it's easy for people to feel that the world is overwhelming and that they are 
powerless. To me that's a lot of crap. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot individually save the world, but as individuals we can make choices 
about the kind of lives we are going to live."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN: CARDENES FINDS HAPPINESS 
WITH PITTSBURGH SYMPHONY 
</P>

When former San Diego Symphony concertmaster Andres Cardenes left town in the 
darkest days of the orchestra's canceled 1986-87 season, he did not completely 
sever his local ties. Each year Cardenes, who is now concertmaster for the 
Pittsburgh Symphony, has returned to perform in various chamber music series. 
On March 6 and 8, he will play a pair of recitals with pianist Karen 
Follingstad, featuring the solo violin works of Brahms and Schubert, at La 
Jolla's St. James Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
After he left San Diego, Cardenes joined the University of Michigan music 
faculty with the intention of avoiding the politics and instability of 
orchestra playing. It took Pittsburgh two years to woo him away from the 
academic confines of Ann Arbor. 
</P>
<P>
The Cuban-born violinist admitted that as his first year as Pittsburgh's 
concertmaster draws to a close, his trepidation about returning to play in an 
orchestra has been proven unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
"It has turned out much better than I thought it would. So far, I've been wrong 
about my reservations -- the usual orchestra mentality, problems of commitment, 
and union troubles. Here there's a good give and take with management that 
keeps things a lot calmer." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his solo performing and teaching violin students at Pittsburgh's 
Carnegie-Mellon University, Cardenes has been busy cultivating new violin 
repertory. 
</P>
<P>
"I've commissioned a new violin concerto by Riccardo Lorenz, which I'll 
premiere with the San Antonio Symphony on Oct. 4, 1990. Lorenz is a young 
Venezuelan composer who directs the Latin American Music Center at Indiana 
University. We were college classmates. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago, I had asked him to compose a violin and harp piece, which I played 
last August at the Skaneateles (New York) chamber music festival. I enjoyed 
working with him, so I put him to work on a concerto." 
</P>
<P>
When apprised of the San Diego Symphony's recent return to solvency and 
apparent stability, he expressed pleasant surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad it's back on its feet. I'm sure Wes Brustad and others worked hard, 
and I hope this time they'll stay afloat." 
</P>
<P>
Does he regret leaving San Diego? 
</P>
<P>
"I can only say this. In retrospect it was a good decision, however painful. At 
the time, there was not much of a choice. Anybody who knows me knows that I'm a 
doer. I don't like to sit around and wait." 
</P>
<P>
Replacement diva. The San Diego Opera has announced that American soprano 
Johanna Meier will replace Sabine Hass in the company's Richard Wagner concert 
March 20 at Civic Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The German soprano has been advised by her physicians not to travel, so she 
canceled her spring American engagements, including her appearance with New 
Orleans Opera as Senta in "The Flying Dutchman," her debut role with San Diego 
Opera two seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
Meier, whose Wagnerian credentials include being the first American to sing 
Isolde at Germany's Bayreuth Festival in 1981, performed in a number of San 
Diego Opera productions during the 1970s. Her Marschallin in San Diego's 1976 
"Der Rosenkavalier" was a memorable performance. She has not sung for the local 
company, however, since her Met debut in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hass will not sing in the Wagner concert, her husband, bass Artur 
Korn, will perform as scheduled. His local debut in last season's "Fidelio" was 
the most universally praised aspect of that controversial production. 
</P>
<P>
American tenor Gary Lakes, whom many consider to be the newest great white hope 
of Wagnerian heldentenors, will complete the trio of singers on the concert. 
This all-Wagner program, conducted by Heinz Fricke, music director of East 
Germany's Berlin State Opera, will include a concert version of the entire 
first act of "Die Walkure." 
</P>
<P>
Musical Mecca. More than 400 string players made inquiry into the San Diego 
Symphony's auditions for two first-chair positions and five section vacancies. 
Music director designate Yoav Talmi is in town this week to sit in on these 
auditions, which started Sunday and will end Wednesday, for which the symphony 
chose 150 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi and the audition committee will hear more than 40 candidates for the 
single section viola vacancy, but only 14 cellists are trying out for the 
principal cello chair left open when former first-chair cellist Eric Kim took a 
similar position with the Cincinnati Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
According to symphony executives, they received inquiries from musicians in all 
50 states and from 14 foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
Opening tonight. Rustavi, the much touted 50-member singing and dancing troupe 
from Soviet Georgia, opens a week run at Symphony Hall tonight at 8 o'clock. . 
. . At UC San Diego's Mandeville Auditorium, the Tokyo International Music 
Ensemble "New Tradition" will present a single concert of contemporary music 
employing traditional Japanese gagaku instruments. Among the composers 
represented on this program, which also begins at 8 p.m., are John Cage, Toru 
Takemitsu, and UCSD faculty member Joji Yuasa.

S.D. SYMPOSIUM STUDIES FATE OF CLASSICS IN MODERN THEATER; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: SCHOLARS AND PRACTITIONERS ARE UNABLE TO AGREE ON A ROLE MODEL FOR 
STAGING SUCH WORKS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Three things you can count on at any symposium about theater: It will not 
accomplish what it set out to do; it will serve as a great chance for theater 
people to network; it will be highly political. Things to watch for: 
contradictions, ad nauseam repetition and hidden agendas. 
</P>
<P>
All of the above prevailed at the Price Center on the campus of UC San Diego 
last weekend, where about 350 theater people gathered from all points of the 
Southland, from across the nation and even from across the water (keynote 
speaker was English director Jonathan Miller) to talk about "The Classics in 
Contemporary Theatre." 
</P>
<P>
It should come as no surprise that there were as many points of view as there 
were bodies present, that most discussions wandered off the point and that it 
was voices from among the sea of listeners that most frequently steered the 
talk back in the direction where it needed to go. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly speaking, participants fell into three categories: scholars and 
academics (most notable among them Jan Kott, author of "Shakespeare Our 
Contemporary," and scholar/critic Martin Esslin); theater practitioners (from 
Anne Bogart of Rhode Island's Trinity Rep to George Coates of the George Coates 
Performance Works in San Francisco to New York's Classic Stage's Carey Perloff 
and the La Jolla Playhouse's Des McAnuff), and the public, consisting mostly of 
people belonging to the first two groups but not serving on panels. 
</P>
<P>
The gauntlet was tossed early by panelist/director/critic Charles Marowitz, 
who, having frequently reinvented Shakespeare, spoke largely about doing that. 
He was perhaps abetted in this narrow view by the implicit fact that Miller is 
a Brit and that, out of about 26, only two panelists were non-Anglos: 
playwright and scholar Paul Carter Harrison, and director Rene Buch, founder of 
New York's 21-year-old Reportorio Espanol. (More on this later.) 
</P>
<P>
Jan Kott broadened the area of definition to include the Greeks, Romans and 
absurdists (namely Samuel Beckett and Bertolt Brecht), and Esslin, declaring 
academic thinking narrow, widened tradition further to encompass "cultural 
material of all types," from Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin (as he clarified 
later) to film, TV and "I Love Lucy." Culture, he argued, "is never fixed. It 
is changing from second to second." 
</P>
<P>
Esslin also took note of the importance of cultural context to enjoyment. "It 
is one thing to see 'Hamlet,' " he said, "and another to see Marowitz's 
20-minute collage of 'Hamlet.' If you know one, you get immeasurably more from 
the other. Many directors think that to make a classic relevant you put 
'Hamlet' in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
"Restaging is rewriting," he responded to Marowitz's notion that to 
contemporize a classic is to tack on "an accretion of connotations to a basic 
text," citing as examples the Anouilh and Brecht "Antigones" and "The Planet of 
the Apes," which he called "a rewriting of 'The Tempest.' " 
</P>
<P>
A panel on experimental theater and the classics got no closer to dealing with 
the subject than to speak of it in paradoxically broad general terms and from 
highly individual points of view. No one was able to define a classic or single 
out valid ways of doing classics in the modern theater for the simple reason 
that, as Esslin said, the classics elude definition and there are any number of 
valid (and invalid) ways of doing them. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who recently staged highly contemporized (and controversial) versions 
of "The Mikado" and "The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny" in Los 
Angeles, dwelt heavily in his keynote address on the inheritance of texts as 
artifacts, and on the popular misconception that "if something does not bear a 
patina from the past (including the 'weathering and mutilation' of a work of 
art), it is not authentic." He believes fidelity is a form of forgery. A script 
is "a promissory note with a view to a performance. If there was a finite idea 
of what behavior should be, psychoanalysis would never have flourished." 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the title of his address ("Survival of the Fittest?"), Miller 
questioned what is fit to survive and how we maintain custody of the works, 
which he said (with a remarkable and unchallenged lack of reference to his own 
part in the assault) have been "hijacked to realize their relevance to modern 
times," adding that he has "some sort of feeling that things have gone too far. 
. . . Our desire to make these (classic works, still undefined) mold to our 
sense of urgency is a form of cultural suburbanism." 
</P>
<P>
"We must come to terms with the mentalite of (previous centuries). We are 
retreating from our own past at an increasingly alarming rate. It is an assault 
on the plenary notion of culture." 
</P>
<P>
Why . . . yes. 
</P>
<P>
A panel that Miller moderated the next day with designers Robert Israel (who 
designed his "Mahagonny") and John Arnone enlightened the audience on the 
relationship of designers with directors, physical space and texts. 
</P>
<P>
There was some extrapolation on forgetting experience in order to retrieve it, 
but not much on whose or in what classics. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the simpatico Rene Buch was vociferous about widening the scope of 
the classics to include Hispanic and other cultures (Calderon, Lorca, Moliere, 
Racine) as Harrison had earlier single-handedly broadened it to include the 
Afro-American one. 
</P>
<P>
And a number of vocal members of the listening public joined in, including UCSD 
Professors Jorge Huerta and Floyd Gaffney. They heatedly protested 
misconceptions in multiracial casting and the absence of more color among 
panelists, which resulted in the tendency to restrict the discussions to 
Anglo-European traditions. 
</P>
<P>
A form of round-table discussion that closed the symposium Sunday saw more of 
the program's failures of omission vented: the put-down of Americans, the lack 
of definition, the frustration at the focus on England and Europe, the absence 
of actors on panels, the lily-white complexion of things. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the weekend was as much about sociology as it was about art. And, 
yes, there was probably something there for everyone -- if nothing more than 
something to rebel against.

BROKERS AND HOUSEWIVES: TOKYO SKID SPARES NONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A wide variety of Japanese companies could be hurt by the recent plunge in 
stock prices on the Tokyo exchange, financial experts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Banks, insurance companies and securities firms, which all hold massive stock 
portfolios, may have to take losses on their investments when they close their 
books March 31, the end of the Japanese fiscal year. And these short-term hits 
could be the mildest effect of the past week's 11% drop in the Nikkei index of 
225 stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Economists and brokerage experts are more concerned that Japanese housewives, 
who have provided a steady base for the market's remarkable performance over 
the past several years, could become disillusioned and abandon stocks, much as 
individual American investors fled the market after the October, 1987, crash. 
</P>
<P>
Worse still, economists believe that the recent volatility in Tokyo is more a 
symptom than a disease. And the disease -- which is both economic and political 
-- is serious. 
</P>
<P>
"There are economic, political and bureaucratic reasons for the market falling 
on hard times," said Robert Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities 
International in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese are widely disillusioned with their political system, which has 
been battered by corruption and bribery. And although the country's recent 
elections were expected to quell some of these concerns, some new appointees 
have been tainted, Brusca said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two bureaucracies that previously worked in concert to boost the 
stock market and the economy now seem to be at odds. The Bank of Japan wants to 
raise interest rates to quiet inflation, but the Ministry of Finance believes 
that interest rate hikes would further damage the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
But the most serious concerns are economic. In previous years, Japan benefited 
from what was termed the "triple merits" -- low interest rates, a strong yen 
and low oil and commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, that process is working in reverse -- triple demerits, so to 
speak," said John Hickling, portfolio manager of Fidelity International Growth 
and Income Fund. "Interest rates and oil prices have gone up a lot, and the yen 
has been very weak against the dollar." 
</P>
<P>
High interest rates tend to depress corporate earnings, which in turn depress 
stock prices. And increasing oil and commodity prices could boost inflation. 
The strong yen, meanwhile, has given the Japanese stunning purchasing power, 
which is bound to wane along with the currency. 
</P>
<P>
Those factors will make it difficult for the Japanese stock market to quickly 
recover from its recent losses, market experts said. The Nikkei average, a 
primary indicator of overall stock prices, has fallen 14.4% from its December 
highs and dropped nearly 11% in just the past week. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of such a decline could be substantial on a wide variety of 
companies that hold and trade securities. 
</P>
<P>
Brokerage houses, which generate well over 50% of their revenues through retail 
trading, could be hurt the most, particularly if small investors are scared 
away. These investors are the bread and butter of the Big Four investment 
houses, despite the fact that big institutions such as banks, insurance 
companies and manufacturing concerns control about 60% of the shares listed on 
the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a souring market makes it difficult to bring companies public, 
another major source of revenue for the securities firms. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a diverse group of manufacturers have used a system called zaitech, 
in which they will actively buy and sell securities to boost corporate profits 
with capital gains. These companies could also get pinched by the drop in stock 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
Then too big financial institutions have substantial securities holdings that 
could be hurt by the drop in the Nikkei average. But these declines are not 
expected to result in losses on the banks' earnings statements. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese banks, for example, often hold large stakes in companies that do 
business with them. In most cases, the banks account for these holdings at 
their purchase prices, leaving them with huge unrealized profits. 
</P>
<P>
However, some banks have recently attempted to offset losses on problem foreign 
loans. Consequently, they've sold these undervalued holdings, recorded the 
gains on their books and repurchased the stock. 
</P>
<P>
Those moves could prove costly if the stock market continues to decline and the 
banks find themselves forced to recognize the declining value of the stocks on 
their balance sheets. 
</P>
<P>
But since most Japanese banks have pursued this strategy with only a small 
portion of their stock portfolios, the market decline is not expected to cause 
immediate losses. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, experts compared the effect of the overall market drop to the impact of 
a one-year drop in Southern California real estate prices on the net worth of a 
person who bought a home 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"These are securities they have owned for years and years. They have huge, 
hidden reserves," said Gregory A. Root, president of Thomson BankWatch, a 
widely followed bank rating agency in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, or Japan Economic Journal, published 
figures that show major Japanese banks have about $300 billion in unrealized 
stock profits. For most Japanese banks, those unrealized gains alone far exceed 
the net worth of the largest U.S. banks. And that doesn't include billions more 
in unrealized gains in real estate that those banks own. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Dai-Ichi Kangyo, the world's largest bank, had the equivalent of 
$35 billion in unrealized stock gains. Sumitomo Bank had the equivalent of 
about $28 billion in unrealized gains.

U.S., Japan Biotech Deal: IDEC Pharmaceutical Corp. of La Jolla said it entered 
a partnership believed to be the first major marketing collaboration between 
private biotech firms from the United States and Japan. An IDEC statement said 
it had entered into an agreement with the Institute of Immunology Co. of Tokyo 
that will give the institute rights in Asia to certain IDEC products plus a 
chunk of IDEC stock in exchange for market penetration for IDEC that could be 
worth up to $23 million in sales over two years.

T-Bill Rates Fall: Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities fell in 
Monday's auction to their lowest level in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury sold $8 billion of new three-month bills at an average discount 
rate of 7.72%, down from 7.80% last week. Another $8 billion of new six-month 
bills was sold at an average discount rate of 7.70%, down from 7.77% last week. 
The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 7.98% for 
three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,804.90, and 8.12% for a 
six-month bill selling for $9,610.70. The discount rate reflects the price 
discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face 
value.

NEXT SECRET WEAPON: THE STEALTH BLIMP;

AEROSPACE: LOW COST, UNMANNED AND INVISIBLE TO RADAR, IT IS BEING DEVELOPED

Most people thinking of stealth aircraft probably think about the B-2 Stealth 
bomber: invisible to radar, fast, sleek, with an estimated price tag of $500 
million or more. 
</P>
<P>
Not Carter Ward. When his thoughts turn to stealth aircraft, Ward thinks about 
something stubby, with a top speed of 28 m.p.h. and costing only about 
$195,000. The stealth blimp. 
</P>
<P>
For three years, Ward, a civilian engineer for the Navy in Port Hueneme, has 
been working on a 69-foot prototype of a stealth blimp -- meant to be unmanned, 
radio-controlled and invisible to radar -- that has so far received about 
$700,000 in funding from the Army. 
</P>
<P>
The armed forces aren't exactly sure how or if they will use the stealth blimp. 
But the Army agency that is paying for Ward's blimp project thinks that it 
could be an "advantageous tool" to add "to its bag of tricks," says Charles 
Browne, an engineer with the Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Center in 
Virginia, which is evaluating the blimp. Browne says the stealth blimp would be 
great for finding guerrilla base camps or investigating ships suspected of 
smuggling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Expensive mega-projects with familiar and frightening doomsday missions, like 
the B-2, seem inevitable for the military. But the stealth blimp is an unlikely 
tale of a comparatively cheap aircraft intended mostly for reconnaissance 
missions. 
</P>
<P>
The melon-shaped stealth blimp also inspires jokes. Says Ward: "When the idea 
is that you're sneaking in, a blimp just sounds funny." 
</P>
<P>
Ward's plan is for a blimp that would be controlled by radio, so no pilots 
would be at peril from enemy bullets. It would be controlled from as far as 100 
miles away, and would send back pictures through a fiber-optic strand strung 
from the blimp to the control station attached to a series of beach-ball-sized 
balloons. 
</P>
<P>
The current prototype, about a third the size of the Goodyear blimp, is being 
tested at a private blimp airfield in Elizabeth City, N.C., after earlier 
checks in Camarillo and at Vandenberg Air Force Base essentially proved that 
the craft could fly as planned. The tests will help determine whether a final 
version of the stealth blimp will be built for use by the military. It's hard 
to say how much more funding the blimp will get, Browne concedes, because its 
current budget is so small that it doesn't appear on most budget plans. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Watson, a model maker who is working on the stealth blimp, long ago 
learned about the surveillance possibilities. A few years ago, he tested a 
bicycle-powered mini-blimp near Palm Springs. Watson says he flew around 
unnoticed by people below: "We'd fly 10 feet over their heads and ring the 
bicycle bell and they'd start looking around on the ground for us." 
</P>
<P>
That may not persuade military planners, but, Ward says, with a little 
explaining the logic of the stealth blimp becomes obvious. He points out that 
blimps are naturally quiet. And because they are mostly made of a fabric bag, 
they don't tend to reflect radar waves much, anyway. The prototype that he has 
built includes radar-absorbing materials to make it more stealth-like. Plus a 
blimp can be made inexpensively for perhaps as little as $50,000, Ward says. 
</P>
<P>
Strange though it sounds, Ward also says it would be hard to knock a stealth 
blimp out of the sky. It's not that you couldn't shoot it as it floated along 
at up to 28 m.p.h. But Ward says bullets would only start a slow leak of helium 
that wouldn't down the blimp until it had had plenty of time to return to base. 
</P>
<P>
Ward first thought up the stealth blimp about five years ago. A research 
mechanical engineer, Ward works for the Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory, 
where his job has been to help the armed forces prepare for military 
construction projects, such as building an airfield on a newly seized piece of 
land during a battle. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of building has to be planned precisely, but surveying can be 
dangerous in war conditions because of enemy troops and land mines. So Ward 
came up with the idea of a radar-invisible, remote-controlled blimp that could 
fly over the land, take pictures, scan with a laser and send back important 
surveying information for planners. 
</P>
<P>
But the Navy thought that the idea was "rather humorous," Ward says, so the 
engineer took his idea shopping. He didn't find someone to pay for development 
of the blimp until 1987, when he found a customer in the Army's now-defunct 
Project Office for Low Intensity Conflict. The office thought that it might use 
the blimp for what it called "counterinfiltration," namely, spying on guerrilla 
wars. 
</P>
<P>
Ward got $150,000 from the Army that year for development. His mandate: Build a 
cheap stealth blimp. "We just wanted to dance it before radar and see if it 
would show up," Ward says. 
</P>
<P>
A low budget was the mother of innovation. Eventually, Ward bought a 
radio-control device used for model airplanes for about $1,300 and modified it. 
And with the help of Navy consultant Atilla Taluy, he hired Watson -- a Simi 
Valley model maker who had made props for movies and for a comedian -- to help 
him put together the first stealth blimp. 
</P>
<P>
Early in his career, Watson helped build and fly the Gossamer Condor, one of 
the first human-powered aircrafts in the world, and the Gossamer Albatross, 
which set the distance record for a human-powered aircraft when it flew about 
22 miles across the English Channel in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't his work on the Gossamer planes that caught Taluy's attention -- 
it was Watson's creation of a bicycle-powered blimp for the comedian Gallagher, 
known for his use of giant couches and other props, as well as for smashing 
things on stage with a sledgehammer. In a 1984 videotape, "Over Your Head," 
Gallagher pedaled the blimp around while singing "Somewhere Over the Rainbow." 
</P>
<P>
Watson started work on a stealth blimp for Ward in 1987, and soon after he 
decided to stop free-lancing and started working for AeroVironment, a 
Monrovia-based company. Watson brought the blimp-building contract to 
AeroVironment, which then became the contractor assembling the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
And while the contractors changed, so did the military agency paying for the 
stealth blimp research. In 1988, Ward was forced to find a new "sponsor" for 
his research when the first one was disbanded. That's when he found some 
financial support from Browne's Army agency, the Intelligence and Electronic 
Warfare Center. 
</P>
<P>
Browne is hoping to find even more sponsors to help pay for the blimp's 
development into a version that is ready to spot guerrillas or smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
New sponsors could take the project in different directions: Some might want a 
blimp that's fast but not stealthy. One of Ward's ideas for a final version is 
a blimp without rudders and stabilizers that wiggles and twists through the air 
like a fish. But Ward also has to contend with more mundane problems such as 
finding a better engine for the blimp. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, some Army units have "expressed interest" in the blimp, Browne 
says. "But they haven't signed up to say, 'We want that one that's painted 
blue.' "

Northrop Ad Ban Back in Court: The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard 
arguments by the federal government about why a ban on a series of Northrop 
Corp. "image ads" should be upheld. Assistant U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Steven G. Madison reiterated the government's position that the ad would 
influence a jury in a criminal trial against Northrop that is scheduled to 
begin today. The ads feature legendary test pilot Chuck Yeager, who is to 
testify on behalf of Northrop at the trial. A Northrop attorney argued that a 
ban would be a restraint of Northrop's First Amendment rights of free speech. A 
U.S. District judge initially ordered that the defense company be prohibited 
from running the ads, but the appeals court Feb. 16 issued an emergency stay of 
that order. A three-judge appeals panel, which viewed four of the 11 ads in a 
San Francisco courtroom, is expected to rule soon.

LABOR: CONSUMER-ORIENTED APPROACH TO UNION ORGANIZING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans are still essentially in what is called the "me-first" generation, 
and union leaders are stepping up their efforts to capitalize on that 
unfortunate fact. 
</P>
<P>
To attract new members and hold present ones, the AFL-CIO is substantially 
expanding its use of corporate marketing techniques and consumer-oriented 
services to try to reverse labor's continuing decline. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s and '40s, when unions were growing rapidly, idealism was a prime 
factor motivating union organizers and attracting members. The unions were, 
they said, appealing to the most generous instincts of workers who were told 
that they could best help others, as well as themselves, by uniting in unions 
to fight for better wages and working conditions for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Self-interest certainly wasn't ignored, but the collective good was stressed, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
That approach succeeded in the days of liberal Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt 
and Harry S. Truman, and with presidential help union membership soared to more 
than 40% of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
But gradually attitudes of most Americans seemed to change. Self-interest began 
to predominate. 
</P>
<P>
Unions still sell themselves as organizations that unite workers for the good 
of all members, and although the differential is getting smaller, union members 
last year had median weekly earnings of $497, compared to $372 for their 
non-union counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
It might seem as though that 33% advantage would attract the most 
self-interested worker without that old appeal to the idealism of the past. But 
it isn't happening. 
</P>
<P>
So, with only 16.9% of all workers in unions today, labor leaders are adding 
other enticements to their appeals for members: special deals for workers as 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
There have been a few signs of initial success, with some unions saying their 
relatively new "Union Privilege" services that range from low-interest 
MasterCards to free legal services are responsible for at least some increase 
in membership. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged, top officers of the 14.5-million-member labor federation last week 
announced the start of another innovative program called "UnionRate," a money 
market deposit account for union members. 
</P>
<P>
Like the union MasterCard, UnionRate is designed to appeal to workers as 
individuals by giving them something more than help in uniting them to win 
higher wages and better working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
A poll taken for the AFL-CIO by the Roper Organization found that 60% of union 
members have money in a regular savings account, and only 15% put their money 
in a bank money market fund that offers a higher rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
UnionRate gives members a low-risk investment and a higher return than the 
usual bank money market fund or bank savings programs, federation officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
It will earn no profit for the unions other than, they hope, more and happier 
dues-paying members. 
</P>
<P>
The MasterCard is already a good attraction. It offers credit for 5% above the 
prime interest rate, which is less than almost any bank charges, and more than 
2 million union members and their families now hold union MasterCards. 
</P>
<P>
Other consumer services include travel discounts, a mail-order pharmacy for 
prescription drugs and term life insurance. Members have bought more than $1 
billion of the insurance in the first year of that program's operation. 
</P>
<P>
To see whether union and non-union members want even more extensive 
consumer-oriented services, the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union has 
started a test in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
To entice non-members to join, the Nashville UFCW local is offering an expanded 
Union Privilege program that includes everything in the basic national program, 
such as the MasterCard, UnionRate investments and insurance, but with added 
</P>
<P>
attractions such as substantial price discounts on everything from car lubes to 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
Workers get that just for joining. But for $49 a year, they also can get 
significant savings on a wide variety of other items ranging from new cars to 
parts and services for cars taken to participating companies such as Goodyear, 
Firestone and Aamco. 
</P>
<P>
If the Nashville test succeeds, it will be expanded across the country. 
</P>
<P>
AFL-CIO unions are also trying to appeal to workers entirely on consumerism 
even when they work in non-union companies. They are urged to join as associate 
members who get the Union Privilege advantages for less than the cost of 
regular union dues. The theory is that, in time, associate members will form 
the nucleus of a union organizing campaign where they work. 
</P>
<P>
Labor is going beyond consumerism in its attempt to regain the influence that 
it once held. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, federation leaders meeting in Bal Harbour, Fla., officially launched 
a multimillion-dollar, "worker-friendly" investment fund to give unions capital 
to help finance their own defensive takeovers. That fund isn't 
consumer-oriented, but it does move them into the world of corporate finances 
where they can help protect worker interests. 
</P>
<P>
Union and worker involvement in corporate buyouts is still pretty rare, but it 
is increasing rapidly through stock ownership plans, and unions are already 
major players in some corporate battles, such as the one at United Airlines, 
where the unions are continuing their effort to win a substantial share of 
stock for United's employees. 
</P>
<P>
It is far from certain, but by appealing to workers with consumer-oriented 
services on a large scale and by expanding their role in corporate leadership, 
unions may at last stop the downward slide that they have been on for the past 
four decades.

UNOCAL WILL SPEND MORE OVERSEAS ON EXPLORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unocal Corp. said Monday that this year, for the first time in company history, 
it will spend more for expenses of foreign exploration for energy resources 
than it does for exploration in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Expenses for foreign exploration of petroleum and geothermal energy will 
increase to $111 million in 1990 from $76 million in 1989, the company said. 
U.S. expenses will increase less dramatically, to $106 million from $92 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The reversal reflects an industrywide trend toward overseas exploration because 
of lower costs and less stringent environmental regulations, said M. Craig 
Schwerdt, an industry analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal's foreign energy exploration and production will be concentrated in 
Thailand, Indonesia, the Netherlands and Ecuador, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Los Angeles-based Unocal said it would boost capital and exploration 
spending to $1.5 billion in 1990, a 22% increase over 1989's $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The increased investment level reflects the company's improved cash flow and 
strategy of investing in projects which offer improved returns," said Unocal 
Chairman Richard J. Stegemeier in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The capital budget in 1990 would be $1.27 billion, up from $1.05 billion in 
1989. That would include domestic capital expenditures of $858 million and 
foreign capital expenditures of $413 million in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Under that, capital spending for domestic petroleum exploration and production 
will amount to $424 million in 1990. Capital spending for foreign petroleum 
exploration and production, including Canada, will be $370 million. 
</P>
<P>
In refining, marketing and transportation, Unocal plans capital expenditures of 
$220 million in 1990, up from $143 million a year ago. The money will go to 
build new equipment at its Los Angeles refinery and to improve its service 
station and truck stop system.

U.S. MARKETS GO OWN WAY; DOW UP 38.29 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wall Street declared its independence from Japan Monday as U.S. stock prices 
soared despite the second-largest one-day point decline ever on the Tokyo 
market. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials surged ahead in the final hour of trading 
to close up 38.29 at 2,602.48, snapping five straight declines. Big Board 
volume was a moderate 148.9 million shares, only slightly more than the 148.49 
million traded Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 7 
among stocks trading on the New York Stock Exchange: 822 were up, 639 down and 
492 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts were confounded by the market's resilience after Tokyo's 
225-stock Nikkei index fell 1,569.10, or 4.5%, to close at 33,321.87. The size 
of the decline was second only to the Nikkei's drop in the worldwide stock 
market crash of October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Many market analysts had expected Wall Street to follow Tokyo's lead, as it did 
last week when the Nikkei index twice fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
"We're no longer in lock-step with the Japanese market," said Paul Hennessey, 
vice president in trading at Boston Co. "People see some companies they like 
and are willing to become buyers." 
</P>
<P>
The Dow's gain was its biggest since a 47-point jump Jan. 31. Last week, the 
Dow lost about 2.7% of its value while the Nikkei plummeted 6.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Despite dire predictions that U.S. shares were in for a bruising after the 
Japanese stock market tumble Monday, prices opened mixed on Wall Street and 
then pushed ahead steadily through the day. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to bargain hunting, a late round of futures-related buying boosted 
the Dow more than 21 points in the last hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
Stock investors also drew strength from the bond market. The price of the 
bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose more than half a percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese stock market has been in turmoil during the past week amid worries 
over higher interest rates and inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
Strength in the dollar also helped deflect the shock waves from the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"The aura of invincibility (of the Japanese market) has been broken," said 
Monte Gordon, director of research at Dreyfus Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Boston Co.'s Hennessey, although encouraged by Wall Street's resilience, said 
the moderate turnover showed the buying "was not overwhelming. It's certainly 
not a tidal wave." 
</P>
<P>
XTRA Corp. rose 5 1/4 to 30 after the transportation leasing company put itself 
up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Express rose 4 1/4 to 51 1/2 on an improved long-term outlook and a 
rumor of a possible buyout interest from a British carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Caterpillar gained 1 3/8 to 59 1/8. An industry analyst raised his rating on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Lin Broadcasting rose 2 1/8 to 111 after McCaw Cellular said it has a 
definitive credit agreement for financing its tender offer for Lin. 
</P>
<P>
United Telecommunications was up 1 3/4 to 34 1/4 on bargain hunting that 
emerged in response to the stock's fall last week. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner edged up 7/8 to 92 3/4. The company said it would buy back about 
$33 million in common stock. 
</P>
<P>
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's American shares fell 5/8 to 7 1/8. The British 
advertising company said profits are likely to fall short of expectations in 
the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Warner-Lambert, which fell sharply Friday on a negative report about its 
Alzheimer's drug, rebounded to 103, up 3 1/4.

Stocks, Dollar Gains Boost Bond Market 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose in active trading, buoyed by the dollar's strength against 
other currencies and a robust performance in the U.S. stock market. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond jumped about 5/8 point, or $6.25 
for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield tumbled to 8.48% from 8.55% late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite uneasiness about the selloff in Tokyo, investors refrained from dumping 
stocks in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a confidence builder that the United States does not have to play 
'follow the leader,' " one analyst said. He said the stock advance bolstered 
the sentiment that U.S. interest rates could ease in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, when Wall Street was stuck in its losing streak, sharp declines in 
stock prices had boosted bond prices as investors moved funds into the 
relatively safe haven of U.S. Treasury securities 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, rose 3.77 to 1,158.55. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds closed at 92, up 3/16 of a point. The average yield to maturity declined 
to 7.40% from 7.42% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for short-term Treasury securities already in 
circulation, yields on three-month bills rose to 7.94% as the discount jumped 4 
basis points to 7.71%. Yields on six-month bills declined to 8.06% as the 
discount slipped 1 basis point to 7.66%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.07% 
as the discount lost 4 basis points to 7.52%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.25%, unchanged from Friday. 
</P>

Dollar Hits 8-Month High Against Yen 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed at an eight-month high against the Japanese yen as investors 
bailed out of the Tokyo stock market and converted their yen holdings into 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
With the dollar soaring, the Federal Reserve Board intervened in the foreign 
exchange market to stem its rise, augmenting massive intervention by the Bank 
of Japan in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
While the intervention tempered the dollar's ascent, it did little to change 
overall bullish sentiment toward the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we still like the dollar," said chief dealer Dan Brooks at the 
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. "In the long term, we see the yen weak against the 
dollar." 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 148.65 Japanese yen, up from 146.47 Friday. 
Later, in London, it rose to 148.80 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 148.63 
yen from 147.07. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained ground against the British pound. In London, the pound fell 
to $1.6927 from $1.7090 late Friday. In New York, the pound fell to $1.6903 
from $1.7092. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the weakness in Japan's stock and bond prices, "the Bank of 
Japan is caught between a rock and a hard place," said Diego Giurleo, corporate 
foreign exchange manager for Royal Bank of Canada in New York.

MARKETING: PLAYER LOCKOUT LEAVES MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PROMOTERS IN LEFT FIELD

<P>
Forget the baseball owners. Forget the players. Forget the peanut vendors. 
Consider, instead, anyone whose unfortunate job it is to promote major league 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Consider them frazzled. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, talks between the owners -- who have locked players out of spring 
training -- and the Major League Players Assn. unraveled faster than a cheap 
sweater. Now, executives in charge of marketing the 26 ball clubs are wondering 
if all their planning, which began when the '89 season ended, is about to hit 
the showers. 
</P>
<P>
Several teams, such as the Dodgers -- who are about to celebrate their 
centennial year -- have many promotions specifically geared for this season. 
But perhaps nowhere is the marketing dilemma more frustrating than at the 
all-sports network, ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
In its bid to be taken seriously by sports enthusiasts, the network recently 
paid about $400 million to broadcast more baseball games over the next four 
seasons than any other network. To lure advertisers, it has run ads in trade 
publications that brag: "We've got the men advertisers can't wait to get their 
mitts on." 
</P>
<P>
So what does ESPN get for its trouble -- and money? It gets beaned. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we could cry in our beer -- at the ballpark," said Michael Soltys, 
manager of programming information at ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
The network estimates that it has spent $16 million on television and print 
advertising to promote the 171 baseball games that it still has every intention 
of broadcasting this season. But late last week, executives at ESPN finally 
started to pull back. The network yanked several TV spots that referred to 
specific spring training games it had planned to air. 
</P>
<P>
"This was to be our crowning moment," Soltys said. "Getting baseball made us 
solid. We've spent a year preparing our marketing plans. Now, all of a sudden, 
we have this thing hanging over us." Meantime, ESPN will continue to air 
general TV spots that refer to the network as "the new hall of major league 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
For ESPN -- and everyone trying to market baseball -- the situation is more 
confusing than a Bert Blyleven curve ball. "It's like trying to swim up a river 
without water," said Bill Knudsen, former vice president of marketing for the 
Seattle Mariners. "You can bet the teams are all in a heavy hand-holding mode 
right now, especially with their season ticket holders." 
</P>
<P>
Many teams treat their biggest season ticket holders to free spring training 
trips. If that training session is canceled or shortened, these key customers 
might be disappointed. And if the season is shortened, advertisers who purchase 
everything from scoreboard space to pages in game programs will have to be 
compensated for the fact that fewer fans will see their messages. 
</P>
<P>
What messages are the individual teams trying to promote? Pretty much baseball 
as usual. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be business as usual until we can't do business," said Tommy Hawkins, 
vice president of communications with the Dodgers. "If there have to be 
changes, we'll make them and adjust." 
</P>
<P>
For the Dodgers, the timing could hardly be worse. Virtually every promotion 
that the Dodgers have planned for 1990 is based on the theme of its team's 
100th year in baseball. All of the team's promotional giveaways -- from caps to 
balls -- feature logos commemorating that. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers are ready to sell a centennial year highlight video, but they don't 
want to put it on the market when the fans are down on baseball. "We'd like to 
release it when baseball is on the air," Hawkins said. "It would be unfortunate 
to announce its release when baseball is not being played." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the California Angels have their share of marketing headaches, too. 
</P>
<P>
The team delayed its planned advertising of season ticket and mail-order sales 
by about 10 days, said John Hays, senior vice president of marketing. Yet, when 
the team opened the season ticket sales window last Wednesday at Anaheim 
Stadium -- without advertising -- it sold 400 season tickets in less than two 
hours, he said. In fact, with 17,000 season tickets sold, the Angels have 
posted their highest advanced season ticket sales ever, Hays said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had a dog team, we know we'd be in a very different situation," said 
Hays, whose team was a contender last season. "We don't know when the public 
might become incensed by a long and bitter labor negotiation period. But it 
hasn't impacted our sales yet." 
</P>
<P>
It has, however, greatly affected how Hays does his job. This is the time of 
year when Hays and his staff give speeches to community groups. People usually 
ask where the team will finish -- but not this year. "The questions aren't 
about the team, but whether there will be a baseball season," said Hays. "The 
focus is away from the sport of baseball and into the business of baseball. As 
a marketing guy, I can tell you we're not comfortable with that." 
</P>

Bo Jackson Reaches Out for New AT&amp;T Campaign 
</P>
<P>
Here we Bo again. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning tonight, Bo Jackson, who plays football for the Los Angeles Raiders 
and baseball for the Kansas City Royals, will hustle for a new team: AT&amp;T. 
</P>
<P>
In the TV spots, created by the New York agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Jackson -- 
who appears in the "Bo Knows Baseball" ads for Nike -- promotes the phone 
company's "Reach Out America Plan," a discount phone service. In the ads, 
Jackson has the phone in his hand and says, "I'm busy. But I still like to keep 
in touch with the guys in L.A. And the guys in Kansas City." 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T, which is trying to attract younger customers and better compete with 
its long-distance rivals, had to get Nike's approval for the spot, said David 
Robertson, advertising director at AT&amp;T. Why Nike? Well, the spot ends with 
Jackson repeating a line similar to that used in several Nike ads. "Bo knows 
long distance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Honda Dealers Ad Spoofs Rivalry Within California 
</P>
<P>
Few Southern Californians know it, but we're being mocked in a TV ad campaign 
that is being broadcast only in the northern part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial, created by the San Francisco agency Goodby, Berlin &amp; 
Silverstein, is for Northern California Honda dealers. The ad, filmed in the 
Senate chambers in Sacramento, features fictional legislatures from both parts 
of the state who argue over widening Highway 1. The legislator from the north 
-- who drives a Honda -- wants to preserve it. The one from the south -- who 
drives a gas guzzler -- wants to widen it into a 10-lane freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea was to draw parallels between people who buy Hondas and the reasons 
people live in Northern California," said Jeffrey Goodby, creative director at 
the agency. "You couldn't do it in a straight way and have anyone take you 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
The agency promises this will not be the last of its spots that pit 
California's north against its south. "This may be the first step in getting 
our water rights back," mused Andrew Berlin, co-founder of the firm. "The next 
spot might show a huge brigade of Hondas taking the water back to the north." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Perrier Crisis No Watershed for Evian 
</P>
<P>
Many marketing managers say the best time to put pressure on the competition 
isn't when they're up, but when they're down. 
</P>
<P>
Witness what Sprint did to AT&amp;T in late January when the phone giant 
suffered a veritable meltdown of its long-distance service because of software 
problems. Within a day, Sprint was running ads that touted its own reliability. 
</P>
<P>
Makers of bottled water had such an opportunity last week when it was revealed 
that the makers of Perrier inadvertently sold some bottles of sparkling water 
tainted with benzene, a chemical which in large quantities has caused cancer in 
animals. But the competition isn't jumping at the chance. 
</P>
<P>
Evian spring water introduced a new ad campaign over the weekend, but it was 
planned and created months ago. And Evian's line of sparkling water, Saratoga, 
also will break a long-planned campaign in a few weeks that will completely 
avoid Perrier's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, we discussed it," said Maryanne Farrell, senior marketing manager at 
Evian Waters of France Inc., headquartered in Greenwich, Conn. "But we decided 
not to capitalize on the situation." Why not turn the screws on Perrier? "It 
could happen to anyone," said Farrell. "We know the shoe could always fall on 
the other foot."

A SWINGING SUNDAY AT THE BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HALF MOON BAY, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was pretty much a family affair at Sunday's 25th anniversary and tribute to 
the founder/owner of the Bach Dancing and Dynamite Society, held in this 
beachside community 30 miles south of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 300 people gathered at the Douglas Beach House, located on an 
oceanfront stretch of the Miramar section of Half Moon Bay, either knew or were 
acquainted with the 61-year-old Pete Douglas, who has been holding music 
sessions in various rooms of his rustic-yet-modern home on Sundays since 1958, 
at first by invitation only. 
</P>
<P>
He opened the establishment to the public in the mid-'60s, under the nonprofit 
Bach Dancing and Dynamite Society name and has since hosted some jazz's biggest 
names -- Bill Evans, Dizzy Gillespie, Art Blakey and Horace Silver, among them. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas has also presented such classical artists as the Kronos String Quartet, 
Chicago's Pro Musica and members of the Juilliard and Guarneri String Quartets 
in Saturday evening Candlelight concerts. 
</P>
<P>
The society is a truly one-of-a-kind establishment, where music lovers come to 
hear some of their favorite artists in a beautiful seaside setting that is 
probably unrivaled for intimacy and scenic beauty. Guests and musicians at 
Sunday's party came from as far away as Sebastopol in the north and Los Angeles 
in the south to bask in Douglas' unique ambiance. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, a slim, pipe-smoking, silver-haired ex-probation officer, mortgage 
broker and realtor, spent most of the early afternoon greeting musicians -- 
more than a few of whom had played the society -- friends and guests who had 
arrived for the 4-10 p.m. bash. The show featured Los Angeles-based alto 
saxophonist Pat Britt's Dirty Dozen big band, with trumpeter Jack Sheldon and 
saxophonist Red Holloway, vibist Bobby Hutcherson, and others. 
</P>
<P>
Familiar faces brought back a lot of old memories. "I'm glad to see so many of 
you are still alive," quipped Douglas to his contemporary, pianist Ed 
Wetteland, father of L.A. Dodger pitcher John Wetteland and a participant at 
sessions in Douglas' original home, a three-room ex-beer joint, in the late 
'50s. 
</P>
<P>
Two major improvements were added later, increasing the area to about 4,800 
square feet, with a concert hall that seats about 250. 
</P>
<P>
Britt's appearance at Sunday's bash was an essential element. Douglas was 
Britt's probation officer after he was arrested for stealing a package of 
luncheon meat, and the tall reedman was the first musician to play at Douglas'. 
</P>
<P>
"He called me up one night in the summer of 1958 and told me he was bringing a 
band down, and that started it all," Douglas recollected. 
</P>
<P>
As showtime approached, people lined up, waiting patiently in the nippy ocean 
breeze for admission into Douglas's concert hall. Many, like Carlotta and Phil 
Bentley of Menlo Park, had been to the society "uncounted times." 
</P>
<P>
"We're some of the originals," Carlotta Bentley said. "We came before the 
newest section, and heard people like (the late pianist) Vince Guaraldi. We've 
always liked the laid-back atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
For Douglas, things this Sunday weren't always so laid-back. At about 4:30 
p.m., the concert hall was jammed with more than 250 people sitting on 
straight-backed chairs, on benches in the loft or standing. And Britt's band 
had yet to start. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in the musicians' lounge and looking at his watch, Douglas chided 
Britt: "Can we socialize later and start the show now?" 
</P>
<P>
Britt, who usually plays Sunday at the Cat and Fiddle Pub in Hollywood, 
gathered his troops, and was set to go about 15 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, we're going to tune up, and then play something," Britt went on, and 
signalled to his colleagues, who proceeded to honk, squeal, whistle and whine 
on their instruments until he gave them a nod. They stopped and with another 
nod from the leader, roared off into an outrageously fast version of Eddie 
(Cleanhead) Vinson's "Tune Up," where drummer Clarence Johnston provided an 
in-the-pocket time feel and tenorist Wilbur Brown spewed out fleet-fingered 
ideas over the speeding background. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas could be seen at the back of his room, pipe ever at hand, digging 
Britt's band. A bubbling blues, "Bump and Run," led to Lee Morgan's buoyant 
"Mr. Kenyatta" and a laden-with-wit vocal blues from Jack Sheldon, who lamented 
about having 49 women and wanting more. 
</P>
<P>
As the band delivered a steamy "Lester Leaps In," Douglas moved into the 
relative calm of his original addition, where a fireplace crackled and guests 
watched the show on a small monitor. 
</P>
<P>
Hutcherson and Douglas talked for a moment. "I remember the first time I played 
here," said the vibist, who lives in the nearby coastal community of Montara 
and has performed at the society almost every year since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of Hutcherson, who played the third set of the evening, brought 
back a funny memory for Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
"One time he was having trouble hearing on stage, so he yelled, 'Turn up the 
monitor,' "said Douglas. "So I shouted back, 'Turn down the band.' " 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the first set, Britt presented Douglas, who was then standing at 
the side of the stage, with a plaque, inscribed with an etched comedic piece on 
how Douglas came to cease being a probation officer for San Mateo County. 
</P>
<P>
When he finished his presentation, which drew a lot of laughs, Britt asked 
Douglas to say a few words, and the crowd chimed in: "We want Pete! We want 
Pete!" 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, uncomfortable in all this limelight, muttered, "Play something. It'll 
happen later." It never did. 
</P>
<P>
As the party wore on, Douglas took refuge in his kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God, things have quieted down a little and I can finally relax. For a 
while there people were coming at me so fast, it was hard to respond," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As the event drew to a close, Douglas philosophized. "This is like a crazy 
cocktail party and I really don't like a party atmosphere for jazz," he said. 
"It's like a festival, and I feel jazz festivals have partly ruined jazz. 
Usually the place is a cross between a nightclub and a concert setting, and in 
that situation, there have been times when I really connected with the music. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is more like, 'What's it got to do with music?' " 
</P>
<P>
Douglas said he was looking forward to getting back to business-as-usual the 
following Sunday, when British saxophonist Courtney Pine was on tap. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we'll have some normal sanity," he joked.

FIRST ON THE SCENE IN STUART MURDER CASE; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: 'RESCUE 911' CAMERA CREW'S EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE OF THE BOSTON SHOOTING 
WILL AIR ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE CRAWFORD, Jane Crawford is a free-lance writer based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The camera crew had spent two nights riding around with the supervisor of the 
Boston Emergency Medical Service, looking for a traumatic injury that they 
could follow from the scene of an accident through surgery to make a compelling 
story for CBS' "Rescue 911." Nothing much had turned up. "We were shooting 
blanks," cameraman Mike Parker recalled. 
</P>
<P>
On the third night, about 8 p.m. last Oct. 23, they were headed toward a 
reported fire-bombed house when they heard a call over the medical frequency 
radio about a shooting in a car. "We took off on a 10-minute ride at top speed, 
with sirens going, not knowing the exact location," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
They found it, and their compelling story. But they wouldn't know for several 
months just how compelling it was. 
</P>
<P>
Using his car phone, Charles Stuart had called the police to report that he and 
his pregnant wife, Carol, had been shot by a black man. Stuart was rushed to 
the hospital, the "Rescue 911" camera team in tow. His wife and child 
(delivered by emergency Caesarean) subsequently died, and an arrest was made. 
But in January, Stuart learned that he had become a suspect and leaped to his 
death from a bridge over the Mystic River, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The footage that Parker shot that night will be shown on "Rescue 911" at 8 
tonight in a 21-minute segment. Although a portion of it has been seen 
previously on news reports about the Stuart case, most of it is being broadcast 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Executive producer Arnold Shapiro said that "Rescue 911" hasn't shown its 
exclusive material until now because the producers initially were waiting for 
Stuart to recover for a follow-up interview. After he killed himself, they had 
to go back to Boston to gather additional material, Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, 42, a veteran photo-journalist who has worked for stations in Miami, 
Atlanta, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, recalls the events of that night vividly. 
A free-lance cameraman working out of Los Angeles and Kansas City, Mo., he was 
teamed with sound man Tom Wolford and director Robin Groth. They arrived at the 
scene along with several police cars. 
</P>
<P>
"We connected our umbilical cable (which attaches the sound equipment to the 
camera) and started shooting," he said in an interview. "I could see that Carol 
Stuart was seriously injured. She had blood all over her and was unconscious, 
slumped in the car. She looked close to death. I started shooting her but the 
cops tried to push us out of the way. The director wanted us to shoot Chuck 
Stuart and the cops kept telling us to move." 
</P>
<P>
"The cops have a less-than-fairy-tale relationship with the media in Boston and 
I tried to explain we were with 'Rescue 911.' They didn't really want to hear 
it. I was (angry). And that created a certain irony, because later they wanted 
our tape and said they wish I had gotten closer," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
The local television stations had arrived by that time, which added to the 
clamor, Parker said. But he had a "hot" wireless microphone on the supervisor 
who was attending Stuart in the ambulance. "We actually got to the hospital 
ahead of the ambulance," he said. He photographed Stuart being taken into the 
trauma room and later in the operating room. 
</P>
<P>
"He was conscious in the trauma room, which was amazing because he had a .38 
pistol wound in his abdomen," Parker said. "He was coherent and I remember him 
inquiring about his wife and wanting to know her condition. Little did I 
understand the full implications of that at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Boston police were doing some digging of their own throughout Stuart's surgery. 
And about four hours into the operation, they wanted to talk to Parker. They 
wanted to look at his tapes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Boston cops dragged us out and took us to the station to look at the tapes 
which they had tried so hard to obstruct us from shooting," Parker said. "We 
are not a news show, we're entertainment; therefore we don't have the same 
protection of the First Amendment as a news show. At the same time, it appeared 
to be such a heinous crime -- the abduction and shooting -- that we wanted to 
do everything we could to help the police find the perpetrator," Parker said. 
They left the police with a dub of the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time I saw Chuck Stuart, he was under general anesthesia with a group 
of doctors fighting for his life," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
Aware that some people wonder if there wasn't a clue somewhere initially that 
Stuart had actually done the shooting as part of his scheme to collect 
insurance money on his wife, the cameraman asked, "Why would you have been 
suspicious of a man having a supposedly perfect marriage, going to Lamaze 
classes with his wife?" 
</P>
<P>
"That he took her to a deserted section and blew her brains out, killing her, 
killing their unborn child and shooting himself in the gut and almost dying 
from that, was not something anybody was thinking of," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
The case also provoked charges of racial bias on the part of the media for the 
way they played up the story of a white couple supposedly being shot by a black 
man. "The story received the widespread publicity it did because it was a great 
story. Had the situation been reversed -- a young, upscale black couple in a 
white Boston suburb shot and killed -- it would have gotten the same coverage," 
Parker maintained. "Remember Howard Beach, remember Tawana Brawley?" 
</P>
<P>
Parker was returning to Kansas City from another story in January when he 
learned of Stuart's role in the killings and his suicide. "I was absolutely 
stunned, and I'm not someone who is easily stunned. I've been in TV news for 20 
years. There are not too many things that surprise or shock me. But this flat 
blew me away. We'd been had." 
</P>
<P>
Producer Shapiro was equally shocked. "For the rest of my life, I will try to 
figure out what makes sociopaths tick. The behavior defies my sense of logic 
and morality." He is developing a TV movie about the case for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
"In all these years of shooting local and network news," Parker said, "this is 
the one story I'll never forget. If I was the least bit naive about anything 
before, this ended it."

CARL ST. CLAIR, 37, NAMED TO PACIFIC SYMPHONY PODIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl St. Clair, an assistant conductor of the Boston Symphony, Monday was named 
music director of the Pacific Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair -- at 37, the youngest of nine announced candidates for the position 
-- will assume his duties on Oct. 1 and expects to spend about three months of 
next year in Orange County. He said Monday that while he will leave Boston, he 
will hold onto one of two other jobs he currently holds with orchestras in New 
York and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of a three-year contact with the Pacific, St. Clair is to 
oversee the orchestra's artistic development and planning, and to conduct six 
pairs of classical concerts each season at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center in Costa Mesa and two concerts each summer season at the Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre. In addition, he is to oversee school and community outreach 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair and orchestra officials would not disclose his salary. 
</P>
<P>
His appointment ends a search that began in February of 1988 with the 
resignation of founding music director Keith Clark after a bitter power 
struggle with the orchestra's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The search made headlines early this month when previous front-runner Lawrence 
Foster said that the Pacific had offered him the job in December but withdrew 
the offer after talks broke down over salary, rehearsal demands and residency 
requirements. The orchestra management has refused to comment on Foster's 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair is also music director of the Ann Arbor (Mich.) Symphony and the 
Cayuga Chamber Orchestra of Ithaca, N.Y. He said Monday that he has not yet 
decided which post he will give up. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that he will maintain a residency in Orange County but that it 
will not be his exclusive address. However, he said, "I intend to spend as much 
time here as needed and as much time as I can." 
</P>
<P>
Pressed further, he said he expects to spend about three months in Orange 
County next year -- eight weeks for concerts plus "one month for administrative

</P>
<P>
Musically, St. Clair said he intends "to work on the ensemble of the orchestra 
. . . its ability to perform as a cohesive unit, and its tone. We will begin to 
address that immediately with our first rehearsal." Critics generally praise 
the high level of the Pacific's musicians on an individual basis, but find 
fault in the overall ensemble, asserting that the orchestra lacks refinement 
and a unified perspective on music-making. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of programming, St. Clair said he will "start out in a more 
traditional fashion" but eventually would include contemporary music. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair was born in southwestern Texas, studied conducting with Walter 
Ducloux at the University of Texas at Austin and taught music for 10 years at 
Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville and for eight years at the 
University of Michigan.

CRITIC AT LARGE: WILLIAM FAULKNER: AN INTRUDER IN HOLLYWOOD'S DUST; 
</P>
<P>
WRITING: SCHOLAR LOUIS DANIEL BRODSKY HAS PUBLISHED THE PULITZER PRIZE WINNER'S 
POWERFUL VERSION OF 'STALLION ROAD,' A SCRIPT THAT WAS NEVER FILMED. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
William Faulkner's troubled days as a Hollywood screenwriter, like those of F. 
Scott Fitzgerald, are occasionally cited as evidence of Hollywood's cynical and 
ruinous treatment of great writers, exploited to do dreck instead of the 
literary masterworks they were capable of. 
</P>
<P>
It seems true that Faulkner was exploitively underpaid, earning $300 a week 
when writers of lesser esteem were making $2,000 and directors two and three 
times that much. But there is also evidence that one or two of Faulkner's 
immediate bosses at Warners were admiring of and patient with him during his 
dismaying bouts with the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
It is also true that Faulkner's finances were never less than catastrophic and 
that the movie work was a fiscal life-raft for him. Yet, also like Fitzgerald, 
Faulkner took screenwriting seriously and appreciated the power and the 
possibilities of the medium. 
</P>
<P>
The young scholar-collector Louis Daniel Brodsky, in conjunction with the 
University Press of Mississippi, has published several volumes of Faulkneriana, 
a bibliography, letters, two earlier Faulkner scripts -- "The De Gaulle Story" 
and "Battle Cry," a collection of other manuscripts and treatments and now, 
decades after Faulkner wrote it, his version of "Stallion Road," edited by 
Brodsky and Robert W. Hamblin (U. of Mississippi Press: $17.95). 
</P>
<P>
The book includes a long scene-setting introduction by the editors and a 
remarkable free-swinging interview with Stephen Longstreet, who wrote the novel 
and whose own script of "Stallion Road" was the one that was finally shot in 
1947, with Ronald Reagan, Alexis Smith and Zachary Scott as its principal 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner's script of "Stallion Road," Longstreet once told an interviewer, "was 
a magnificent thing, wild, wonderful, mad. Utterly impossible to be made into 
the trite movie of the period. Bill had kept little but the names and some of 
the situations of my novel and had gone off on a Faulknerian tour of his own 
despairs, passions and story-telling." 
</P>
<P>
To Brodsky, Longstreet confirmed his earlier assessment. "It was a little 
strong for then . . . a beaut, all shadow and highlights and with the smell of 
the best horses." The novel is set at horse-breeding ranches on the Central 
California coast, with a dedicated young breeder working on an anti-anthrax 
serum and a headstrong nymphomaniac creating some intense sexual triangles. 
</P>
<P>
In that era, of course, scripts were submitted to the Hays Code administrators 
for approval before shooting began. It was a censoring operation in the truest 
sense. The preliminary report on the Faulkner script by Joseph Breen, who ran 
the Code administration, is extracted in the introduction and is far from 
negative, although Breen made clear that the adultery would have to be handled 
very discretely. (The adulteress is killed, preserving the Code's mandatory 
retribution for misdeeds.) 
</P>
<P>
"Today," Longstreet said in his earlier comments on the script, "it could be 
made as a New Wave film." It could certainly be made as a Hollywood film now, 
with the steaming passions intact. 
</P>
<P>
What is interesting about the script is the evidence that Faulkner had become a 
very good screenwriter. Adapting the sprawling novel, he dropped Longstreet's 
narrator, combined characters to give the story more straight-line momentum. 
The script is relatively sparing on dialogue but generous with dramatic action 
which moves the story and illuminates the characters 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner was in the end, Longstreet says, as good as any film writer working. 
Despite his self-made distractions, he was also uncommonly quick and 
productive, typing away through blinding hangovers and impatient with 
interruptions. 
</P>
<P>
He had no doubt of his own gifts. "There are only three writers in America," 
Longstreet remembers Faulkner saying: "Hemingway, myself, and Thomas Wolfe. . . 
. I'm the best." Longstreet protested that Wolfe was a mess and a phony. "No. 
No," Faulkner insisted. "Wolfe, Hemingway and myself are the three writers." 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner was unprintably unfond of Southern California. "One leaf falls in one 
of these canyons and they tell you it's winter," he complained to Longstreet. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the success of two major films he collaborated on for Howard Hawks, "To 
Have and Have Not" and "The Big Sleep," the frustrations of the screenwriter's 
life got to Faulkner. Shortly after his script of "Stallion Road" was shelved 
in 1945, he went back home to Oxford, Miss. He worked for Hollywood only twice 
again, on "The Left Hand of God" and "Land of the Pharaohs" in the 1950s.

Drug traffickers, fearful of extradition to the United States, said in a 
communique that they will surrender if they can be tried in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
"We accept the decisions of Colombian justice, because we are subject to its 
constitution and its laws," the traffickers said in a communique published in 
the Bogota daily El Tiempo. The communique was addressed to a group of former 
Colombian presidents as well as church and political leaders. It was signed by 
"The Extraditables," the name adopted by leaders of the Medellin cocaine 
cartel.

<P>
The latest negotiations center on a new Australian peace plan calling for the 
United Nations to establish a caretaker government in Phnom Penh until free 
elections can be held. The talks opened amid a new offensive by the 
Vietnamese-backed government to drive resistance forces out of areas they 
seized in northwestern Cambodia late last year. There were reports that Vietnam 
at one point last October may have sent a contingent of 5,000 to 10,000 troops 
back into Cambodia to help bolster the fledgling Phnom Penh army.

A tour bus carrying American youths to a recreation center plunged from the 
road down a 130-foot embankment near the Rhine River city of Oberwesel, 
injuring 30 of the passengers, police said. Twenty of the youths were seriously 
hurt, and 10 others suffered minor injuries, a police spokesman said. He added 
that authorities had not immediately determined whether the Americans were 
tourists or relatives of military or diplomatic personnel in West Germany.

A Mono County teacher who was lecturing a class of students when she was hit by 
a bullet fired from a high-powered rifle from 1.7 miles away has been awarded 
$195,000 by a Vista Superior Court jury. Ruling in favor of Patricia 
Holland-Suppa, 29, of Lee Vining, jurors found that one of two hunters who were 
target-shooting Oct. 4, 1985, fired the rifle negligently. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Joseph Suppa, 30, was awarded $10,000 for loss of marital 
companionship. Holland-Suppa's elbow was fractured by the bullet as she was 
teaching English at Mammoth High School. The case was tried in Vista, in 
northern San Diego County, because one of the hunters, a retired Marine Corps 
captain, lives there. The other hunter is an El Segundo police officer.

GERMANS TO BUY MANSION THAT WAS HUB FOR EXILES FLEEING NAZIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pacific Palisades mansion that was a gathering place for intellectuals who 
fled Hitler's Germany is being bought by a West German foundation for use as a 
research center for European-American relations and German exile literature. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by USC, which inherited the house in 1987, to sell it for $1.9 
million is a victory for the German foundation and for preservationists who two 
years ago opposed a plan by the university to sell the property and move its 
prized 36,000-volume library to the university's Exposition Park campus. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans -- with the support of West German President Richard von 
Weizsaecker and former Chancellor Willy Brandt -- wanted to keep the house and 
library intact as a monument to German writers and artists who fled Nazi 
persecution and settled in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed in December, USC will allow approximately 22,000 
volumes to be kept at the mansion on a long-term loan. The remaining books -- 
all rare first editions or volumes printed before AD 1500 -- will be kept in a 
temporary storage facility near the campus until they can be moved into a 
permanent wing to be built in Doheny Memorial Library in the next several 
years, said George Abdo, USC executive assistant to the president. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-style house, featuring a sweeping view of the Pacific from a bluff 
above Sunset Boulevard, was bought by the late German novelist and playwright 
Lion Feuchtwanger in 1943 and served as a hub for the German exile community in 
Los Angeles and other European notables. Among its regular visitors were Thomas 
Mann, Charlie Chaplin, Bertolt Brecht, Aldous Huxley, Arnold Schoenberg and 
Bruno Walter. 
</P>
<P>
"For them, the Villa Aurora was a productive and important meeting place during 
the exile period," said Lothar C. Poll, spokesman for the group that is buying 
the house and publisher of the West Berlin Tagesspiegel, the city's main daily 
newspaper. "It was a kind of 'Weimar on the Pacific.' " 
</P>
<P>
At least twice a year, members of the exile community would gather at the house 
to hear Feuchtwanger read from manuscripts of his latest plays or novels, 
according to USC professor Harold von Hofe, senior fellow of the new research 
center, called the Villa Aurora Institute. After discussions, the group would 
adjourn downstairs for herring salad followed by apple strudel, recalled Hilde 
Waldo, Feuchtwanger's personal secretary. 
</P>
<P>
The house was built in 1927 by the Los Angeles Times as a showcase of the 
latest in home design. 
</P>
<P>
Feuchtwanger's widow, Marta, left the mansion and library to USC upon her death 
in 1987, but her will gave the university the option of selling the house and 
using the proceeds to build a Lion Feuchtwanger Memorial Library on campus. The 
house's library would have been moved to the new library, in that case. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to buying the house, the German foundation, called the Circle of 
Friends and Supporters of the Villa Aurora, has agreed to pay an estimated $2 
million to upgrade the house's interior and shore up its crumbling foundation. 
The group also will be responsible for raising funds to run the Villa Aurora 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Von Hofe said the West German Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, and the 
West Berlin senate, as well as private donors, contributed funds to the 
preservation effort. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the institute have yet to be worked out, but university officials 
said the main focus will be European-American relations, a topic they say will 
become increasingly critical as political events in Europe continue to unfold. 
</P>
<P>
Among speakers already lined up for institute-sponsored lectures in the summer 
and fall are Brandt and West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper, said Daniel M. Evans, 
attorney for the Friends of Villa Aurora, the California counterpart of the 
German group. The lectures will probably be given at USC or at other facilities 
that can hold large audiences, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
The house will also serve as a center for research into German exile 
literature, including studies of works by Feuchtwanger, Mann, Alfred Doeblin 
and other German writers who produced many of their best-known works in Los 
Angeles. The exile studies center will be closely tied to the existing 
Feuchtwanger Institute for Exile Studies on the USC campus, said Von Hofe, who 
also heads the campus institute. 
</P>
<P>
Von Hofe said the research center will necessarily operate on a small scale -- 
the house does not comfortably hold more than about 50 people, he said, and 
parking on the narrow and winding road that leads up to it is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, plans for the institute must first be presented to neighbors at a 
public hearing chaired by a city zoning administrator, who will decide whether 
to recommend a conditional use permit for the center, said Claire Rogger, 
deputy to City Councilman Marvin Braude. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement caps two years of long-distance negotiations between USC and the 
German foundation. USC initially rejected the Germans' preservation proposal, 
but several weeks later said it would reconsider it, if the group came up with 
$15 million to pay for the new Feuchtwanger library on campus, repair the house 
and establish an endowment to run a research center at the mansion, which the 
university would continue to own. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans said they would agree to such a plan only if half the money could 
be raised from American donors, a proposal that ultimately fell through because 
the U.S. fund-raising effort failed, Von Hofe said. However, the Germans' 
fund-raising campaign was more successful, and USC changed its position and 
agreed to sell the house. 
</P>
<P>
Final terms of the agreement were worked out last fall, Von Hofe said, and a 
board of trustees of the Villa Aurora Institute will be chosen soon after 
escrow closes in the next few months.

COMRADE OF TWO COUNTRIES; 
</P>
<P>
A SOVIET TALK-SHOW HOST WHO GREW UP IN AMERICA SAYS HIS DUAL IDENTITY COST 
HIMCREDIBILITY IN BOTH COUNTRIES.

<TEXT>
<P>
Out on Boylston Street, in front of a snow-covered Boston Common, a film 
student from Emerson College eagerly approached a familiar-looking figure. 
</P>
<P>
"Excuse me," Lauren Renihan, 21, said to the silver-haired man in the trench 
coat. "Aren't you Mr. Vladimir?" 
</P>
<P>
That is how identifiable Vladimir Posner has become to American followers of 
events in the Soviet Union. A frequent guest on shows like "Nightline" and 
"Donahue," the 56-year-old Soviet journalist is said to be known to more 
Americans than any Russian other than Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev or his 
wife, Raisa. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike the Gorbachevs, Posner speaks such perfectly unaccented American 
English that he might have been raised in Sacramento, or maybe St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that this host of Soviet television's two most widely viewed talk 
shows actually grew up in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Living in Manhattan from age 6 to 15, "I never thought of myself as Russian," 
said Posner, munching on Famous Amos cookies and sipping cranberry juice in the 
warmth of his hotel room. "I didn't even speak Russian." 
</P>
<P>
In those years before McCarthyism took hold, Posner was the kind of normal, one 
might say All-American, kid who delivered newspapers, sparred in street fights 
and idolized Joe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids in school called me Vlady," Posner remembered. It was a peculiarly 
American diminutive that never would have existed in Russia, the land of his 
father, where Posner and his parents settled when young Vladimir was 19. 
</P>
<P>
The family had left the United States when Vladimir was 15 and his father had 
lost a high-paying job in the film industry. Their first stop was Germany, a 
country Posner abhorred. Finally, Posner, his parents and younger brother Paul 
established residence in his father's home country. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't return to Russia. I went," said Posner, who was born in his mother's 
homeland, France. "I had a strong dual identity. For a great many years, the 
Soviets would not really accept me as a legitimate Soviet. And I thought, 'Who 
am I?' " 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Posner said, "I decided it didn't matter. I know that I am the 
product of several different cultures and countries, and I relish that." 
</P>
<P>
Just as it has helped vault him to the status of perestroika superstar, 
Posner's dual identity has both earned and cost him credibility on both sides 
of what was known before glasnost as the Iron Curtain. Critics in America and 
the Soviet Union alike have said he must be a KGB plant; how else could he be 
so incisive -- and often so provocative -- about these two radically different 
societies? 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, he said, "there is still some suspicion that I am too 
Western." Much the same doubts apparently exist in the United States, where a 
Harvard University professor whom Posner debated insisted that Posner have a 
Soviet flag in front of him so the audience would know which one was the 
Russian. 
</P>
<P>
Along with his sharp opinions about both countries, Posner's divided childhood 
is a major theme of his new book, "Parting With Illusions" (Atlantic Monthly 
Press, $19.95). 
</P>
<P>
Though the book addresses the values, ethics and highly divergent national 
philosophies of both countries, it was in conjunction with that singularly 
capitalistic form of ritual torture -- the book tour -- that Posner and his 
wife, Katherin, were in Boston recently. 
</P>
<P>
Posner said he has been amazed by what has taken place in his country since he 
began writing his book. In his wildest imagination, he said, he could not have 
constructed a Soviet Union where hundreds of thousands of people would march 
through the streets of Moscow to demand change; where the country's leader 
would be discussing the possibility of multiparty elections; where a phrase 
like capitalistic socialism might entrench itself in the national vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought these changes might happen," Posner said, spreading his arms in an 
expressive gesture. "But not in my lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
So much has happened in the Soviet Union, and in such a short time, that 
"nobody would have believed it," he said. "Nobody." 
</P>
<P>
As Posner points out, "I am not the first one" to declare that the Cold War is 
over. Even Dan Quayle, the fervently anti-Communist vice president of the 
United States, was caught recently saying the Russians might not be so bad 
after all, Posner observed. 
</P>
<P>
The changes in U.S.-Soviet relations and the tumultuous events in the Eastern 
Bloc have come so rapidly, Posner said, that many people on both sides of the 
globe have been left with their stereotypes showing. 
</P>
<P>
If, in America, it is no longer fashionable to think of Russians as an entire 
nation of bad guys, Soviets are now reevaluating the old view of people in the 
United States as mindless and materialistic pawns of capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us are going to die with these stereotypes," Posner said. On the other 
hand, many people are finding it "a tremendous relief" to let go of these 
unsavory images. 
</P>
<P>
"At least the initial reaction is that if we can get together, then everything 
will be hunky-dory," Posner said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons Americans have been enthralled with Gorbachev is that for 
45 years Americans have lived under the shadow of nuclear annihilation," he 
went on. "When all of a sudden, it seemed that the big, bad Commies were not 
that bad, there was this huge sigh of relief." 
</P>
<P>
Just exhaling all those ugly old images "brought Americans halfway out of their 
chairs," Posner said. 
</P>
<P>
But, he cautioned, "halfway out is a very uncomfortable position. If something 
goes wrong, they will go right back" to their old preconceptions. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, as on television, Posner often weighs in with opinions about 
America that many people do not like to hear. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been accused by some Americans of what they call bashing America," he 
said. "I laugh. I say, 'You guys have been bashing the Soviet Union for years, 
and when somebody says something you don't like, you get up on your high 
horse.' 
</P>
<P>
"If you like America -- and I do -- there is a lot to criticize," Posner said. 
"Poverty would be the first thing, and hunger, and then that America 
consistently preaches on the issue of human rights around the world and is not 
always where it ought to be on that issue in its own country." 
</P>
<P>
Criticism of pre-perestroika Russia was a lot easier, Posner said, because 
officially, anyway, there was no criticism. "You didn't have to think." Now, he 
said, "if people in the Soviet Union are critical of Gorbachev, one reason is 
that he has made it more complicated than it used to be, by presenting more 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
"Some would like the authoritarian father-figure leader to come back and say, 
'Children, this is what we are going to do,' " Posner said. 
</P>
<P>
But he rebuts those who think such a figure might be V. I. Lenin, the father of 
socialism, or those who say that the events in the Soviet Union today have 
Lenin turning in his tomb in Red Square. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe for the first time in nearly 70 years, Lenin has stopped turning in his 
grave," Posner said. "What we have had has been anything but the socialism 
envisaged by Lenin. 
</P>
<P>
"What I think we may be seeing now is an attempt to go back to the original 
ideas of the revolution," he said. "That is what Gorbachev has been talking 
about." 
</P>
<P>
But philosophical change is not the only thing his compatriots are after, 
Posner said. 
</P>
<P>
"More than anything else, they want more in the stores," he said. "They want 
more meat, more vegetables, more fruit. Most of all, they're sick and tired of 
standing in line." 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Posner said, Soviet consumers would have said, "Yes, it's 
tough, but you have to do it for the greater good of the state." Today, "that 
is what is changing, the idea that you have to sacrifice for the greater goal 
of the future. That is finished." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Posner's own sense of disillusionment with the Soviet Union has 
been so high that he came close to emigrating. During a world youth festival in 
Moscow in 1957, he recalled spending two weeks living in a Moscow University 
dormitory with some students from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I suddenly realized I was homesick -- for New York City," he said. "I wanted 
to go back." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, when Posner was a successful magazine journalist, his 
request to travel abroad was denied by Soviet authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like being told I was a second-class citizen, not worthy of trust," he 
said. "It hurt so damned much" to feel rejected by his own government that 
Posner said he began "drinking too much" and talking about emigrating. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt betrayed, frustrated beyond anything I could explain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Posner persevered, adhering to his belief that "if you could just not 
betray yourself, then you will win. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you," he said, "if there is one quality that I may have, it is the 
ability to hang tough." Still, he said, reverting to a decidedly un-Soviet 
idiom, "a couple of times I nearly copped out." 
</P>
<P>
Posner maintained his sense of connection to the United States through movies, 
through reading novels he obtained from the Book-of-the-Month Club and through 
meeting with Americans who traveled to the Soviet Union. It was as if, he said, 
he had "this subconscious desire" not to lose his ties to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wanted to be this link," he said. "What I have tried to do in my 
limited way is to help Soviets understand Americans in a more, how shall I put 
this, in a more human way." 
</P>
<P>
The thawing of Cold War barriers has left Posner with a sense of new hope for 
the two countries he has lived in and loved, and for the planet as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people can really look forward to the 21st Century," he said. "It may 
finally be the flowering of the human race." 
</P>
<P>
But before that can happen, Posner has an agenda of his own, and that is to 
finish rewriting his book in Russian. Translation would not work, the one-time 
translator said, because even with glasnost, the cultural differences remain 
too vast. "For instance, if I write that Joe DiMaggio was my hero, I would have 
to explain it to a Soviet reader." 
</P>
<P>
Posner smiled, and the blue eyes that have helped make him the leading 
television personality in the Soviet Union twinkled. It's cumbersome to have to 
rewrite the whole book, he said. But alas, "I haven't yet mastered the art of 
writing in two languages at once."

LEGISLATORS' GROUP PETITIONS GOVERNOR AGAINST MALATHION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A bipartisan coalition of 18 Southern California legislators who represent 
areas being sprayed with malathion urged Gov. George Deukmejian on Monday to 
halt spraying of the pesticide until there is "solid evidence" it is safe. 
</P>
<P>
In the first organized legislative attempt to block the use of malathion, the 
lawmakers criticized what they called the governor's "spray now, ask questions 
later" policy and questioned whether the chemical might cause a variety of 
maladies. 
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative, for the health and safety of over 1.2 million Californians, 
that you call an immediate halt to aerial spraying of malathion bait spray 
until solid evidence is presented that the spraying poses no harm to residents 
in the sprayed areas," the 18 Assembly members wrote in a letter to the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of the Southern California lawmakers, Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown (D-San Francisco) has called a rare meeting of the entire Assembly next 
Tuesday to take testimony from scientific experts on both sides of the 
malathion issue. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a press conference in Orange preceding the first meeting of a 
blue-ribbon committee that will study the malathion issue, the head of the 
state Department of Health Services said there is no direct evidence that 
suggests the pesticide spraying should be halted. Nevertheless, Kenneth W. 
Kizer told reporters that more scientific research is needed. 
</P>
<P>
The newly formed Malathion Health Effects Advisory Committee, consisting of 23 
doctors, academicians and public health workers from across the Southland, will 
meet several times a month and draft a final report on the potential health 
effects of malathion spraying. That process should take months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer also stressed that many committee members, although recruited by the DHS, 
have voiced strong opposition to malathion spraying. "This by no means can be 
viewed as a rubber-stamp committee," Kizer said. "We're going to have a a very 
open and thorough discussion." 
</P>
<P>
Health officials formed the committee at the request of the State Department of 
Food and Agriculture because of the public outcry over the use of malathion. 
</P>
<P>
Many legislators are also feeling intense pressure from constituents whose 
homes are being sprayed repeatedly with malathion in efforts to eradicate the 
Mediterranean fruit fly in Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties. 
Some legislators, such as Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), have been 
spurred into action after their own homes were sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
"They have so botched handling this. I don't know if it's possible to calm 
people down," Katz said. "I think you have to stop the spraying in order to 
restore public confidence in government." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park), chairwoman of the Assembly 
Environmental Safety Committee, summed it up this way: "I'm not sure that it's 
dangerous. I'm not sure that it's safe. But I am sure that my constituents are 
extremely frightened. And anxiety can certainly make people sick, if not 
malathion." 
</P>
<P>
In their letter to the governor, the 13 Democrats and five Republicans cited 
health experts who say malathion may cause damage to the nervous system, 
headaches, nausea and flu-like symptoms. In addition, the letter said, some 
experts suspect the pesticide of causing liver cancer in rats. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, backed by state health officials, insists that malathion poses no 
health threat. In a strong defense of the aerial spraying, the governor said in 
Pasadena last week that "hundreds and hundreds" of studies have shown malathion 
to be safe. 
</P>
<P>
"Malathion has been around for four decades," the Republican governor said. "If 
there was any major adverse health effect from the use of malathion, it would 
have been known long before now." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Deukmejian press secretary Bob Gore said the governor was in 
Washington and his office would have no response to the legislators' letter. 
</P>
<P>
The Deukmejian Administration's handling of the Medfly crisis, however, has 
come under criticism even from Republican legislators who normally side with 
the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress), for example, complained that state 
officials have not properly notified the public of the spraying or presented 
convincing evidence that malathion is safe. 
</P>
<P>
"They did not let me know in my district what was going to be coming down," 
Allen said. "My home was sprayed too. I guess it's like anything in government 
-- unless your ox is gored, you don't recognize the reality. The people in my 
district are really to the point of rebellion. They're very frightened."

SANDINISTA LOSS IS DEMOCRACY'S GAIN, LATINS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Times Wire Services

<TEXT>
<P>
Latin American democracies Monday embraced Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's 
stunning upset victory in Nicaragua as proof of an anti-totalitarian 
groundswell in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro's victory "enormously fortified democracy in the region, and we can 
foresee a promising future for her country and for definitive peace," President 
Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina said in a statement in Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador, a close U.S. ally, also expressed satisfaction at Chamorro's 
victory and said it might help peace prospects in El Salvador. The Salvadoran 
government has accused Nicaragua, under the defeated leftist Sandinista regime, 
of aiding leftist rebels in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
But government spokesman Mauricio Sandoval also spoke admiringly of the 
"political maturity" of defeated President Daniel Ortega in acknowledging his 
election loss. 
</P>
<P>
In Chile, Gutenberg Martinez, secretary general of President-elect Patricio 
Aylwin's Christian Democratic Party, said he is "satisfied . . . that the 
reconstruction of the democratic system in Latin America continues to march 
on." 
</P>
<P>
"Cuba is now the only American nation outside the democratic system," Martinez 
said, calling it "an island that tarnishes the hemisphere's image of liberty 
and democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Chile will emerge from more than 16 years of military dictatorship when Aylwin 
is inaugurated March 11. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's foreign minister, Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto, said Chamorro's victory 
"filled me with joy" and that it completes the establishment of democracy in 
Central America. 
</P>
<P>
In Panama, Vice President Guillermo Ford said: "God bless Violeta." Ford was an 
opposition candidate in elections last May that were annulled by Gen. Manuel A. 
Noriega, later deposed in a U.S. invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The Cuban state media, which had been predicting a near-certain win for Ortega, 
reported without comment that the U.S.-backed Chamorro appeared headed for 
victory. Communist Cuba has been a major supporter of the leftist Sandinista 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the world, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar praised 
the vote as a major step toward Central American peace. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega's government "deserves warm commendations for having convened these 
elections ahead of schedule, having submitted to the test of the people's will 
and accepting the verdict of the ballot box," he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said: "This is good news for Nicaragua, 
for Latin America, for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
In Norway, generally sympathetic to the Sandinistas, Foreign Minister Kjell 
Magne Bondevik said: "It is now decisive that the result of the vote is also 
followed and respected . . . something I believe will happen."

U.S. FACES TOUGH CHALLENGE IN HELPING AILING ECONOMY; 
</P>
<P>
FOREIGN AID: AMERICAN-INSPIRED SANCTIONS HAVE DEALT A SEVERE BLOW TO THE 
COUNTRY. 'THERE IS NOTHING MUCH TO REBUILD,' SAYS ONE ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL.

The Bush Administration's efforts to nurse Nicaragua's sanctions-strangled 
economy back to health are likely to be more modest -- and decidedly more 
difficult -- than the U.S. rebuilding of Panama, government and private 
analysts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Not only have the U.S. trade restrictions on Nicaragua been broader and more 
effective than those that Washington imposed on Panama, but Nicaragua had only 
a rudimentary economy before the United States clamped on its embargo. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result, there is nothing much to rebuild -- everything has to start just 
about from scratch," said a U.S. official who is involved in the 
Administration's review of the Nicaraguan economic situation. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Taylor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who surveyed 
Nicaragua's economy last year under a contract for Sweden's foreign aid agency, 
reached the same conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's greatest need, he said, is cash to pay for the goods it has to 
import "until the economy has a chance to recover. And that could take quite a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. sanctions, imposed by former President Ronald Reagan on May 1, 1985, 
include an embargo on virtually all trade between the two countries, a cut-off 
of all commercial air traffic and refusal to allow Nicaraguan-flagged ships to 
enter U.S. ports. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has also blocked all lending to Nicaragua by international financial 
institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the 
Inter-American Development Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Although the trade embargo has not left Nicaragua totally helpless, it has 
crimped that country's exports and forced Nicaragua to hunt for substitute 
markets abroad -- often at the price of having to pay higher shipping costs. 
</P>
<P>
The trade restrictions are far more sweeping than those that the United States 
imposed on Panama in March, 1988, as part of an effort to depose Gen. Manuel A. 
Noriega, then the country's dictator. The United States lifted those 
restrictions after its Dec. 20 invasion of Panama forced Noriega out of power. 
Noriega is now in a Miami jail awaiting trial on drug-trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
In Panama's case, the United States had also frozen the country's cash assets 
in the United States, as well as tax payments from U.S. firms with branches in 
Panama and fees that the U.S. government owed for the use of the Panama Canal. 
But Nicaragua had none of these assets for the United States to freeze. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a far cry from Panama," an Administration official said, referring to 
possible lifting of the sanctions. "The jump-start rhetoric we've used in 
Panama just doesn't apply." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's calculations show that the embargo has cost Nicaragua about $100 
million a year in lost trade -- a sizable sum in an economy that totals only 
$2.5 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been quite effective," he said. "Exports have fallen off sharply, while 
imports have remained high." 
</P>
<P>
The years of U.S. trade sanctions, combined with the Nicaraguan government's 
prosecution of a civil war against the Contras, have left the country's economy 
in tatters and in need of emergency help. 
</P>
<P>
The economy is in a recession and is plagued by hyper-inflation. Export 
earnings are down to less than half the $700 million to $800-million per year 
that prevailed in the late 1970s. And Nicaragua is about $250 million in 
arrears on loans to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"The economy there is in shambles," said Peter Hakim, director of the 
Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank that specializes in 
Latin American economic affairs. "They really are in serious trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimate that lifting of the U.S. sanctions and unblocking potential 
loans from the World Bank and the development bank could help buoy Nicaragua's 
economy until the new democratic government can begin to rebuild it. 
</P>
<P>
The United States could also revive some old trade benefits, such as the 
duty-free status for Nicaraguan imports here. It also could accept Nicaraguan 
sugar. 
</P>
<P>
But most experts see little that the United States can do to stimulate the 
country's economy very quickly. Nicaragua's major exports include cotton, 
shrimp, meat and coffee, and the world price of all four commodities is 
falling. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, U.S. foreign aid already is committed to the brim, and European 
governments are more likely to be interested in investing their aid in the 
emerging East European democracies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be pretty much up to the Nicaraguans themselves," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. SANCTIONS ON NICARAGUA 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade embargo against Nicaragua was imposed by former President Reagan 
on May 1, 1985, and continued by President Bush last Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said then that if Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega were to hold fair 
elections and implement democratic reforms "the emergency that prompted the 
imposition of the trade sanctions would largely be resolved." 
</P>
<P>
The sanctions impose: 
</P>
<P>
An embargo on all U.S. exports to or imports from Nicaragua of goods or 
technical data; 
</P>
<P>
A ban on all flights to and from the United States by Aeronica, the Nicaraguan 
airline; 
</P>
<P>
A ban on entry of Nicaraguan-registered ships into U.S. ports; 
</P>
<P>
Termination of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation with 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Exceptions to the trade ban include books and magazines, as well as medicine, 
food and clothing "intended to be used to relieve human suffering." 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua, a poorly developed agricultural nation, exports mainly coffee, 
cotton, bananas and other farm products; it imports machinery, equipment and 
oil, among other items. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TRADE WITH U.S. AND SOVIET BLOC 
</P>
<P>
The United States was once Nicaragua's biggest trading partner. But trade has 
dwindled to virtually nothing since the 1979 revolution that brought leftist 
Sandinistas to power. The Reagan Administration suspended economic aid in 1981 
and imposed trade sanctions in 1985. Meanwhile Nicaragua's imports from Soviet 
Bloc nations, mainly the Soviet Union and Cuba, have soared.

The Bush Administration, in a move that could provoke a nasty confrontation 
with China, has taken a first step toward supporting Taiwan's application to 
join the organization that administers the world's trading system. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. strategists disclosed Monday that an interagency task force has endorsed 
as economically sound Taiwan's proposal to become part of the 97-country 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The issue now goes to the National 
Security Council for an evaluation of the political consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Administration officials say that President Bush, who is under pressure 
from Congress to approve Taiwan's bid, could decide the issue by mid-March. 
Although U.S. support would not automatically guarantee membership for Taiwan, 
U.S. and GATT officials said the necessary consensus in the organization would 
probably form quickly if the United States signaled its approval. 
</P>
<P>
The government of China has warned that accepting Taiwan into GATT would 
violate almost two decades of understandings between Washington and Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, there had been an unspoken agreement that China would join GATT 
first, to be followed by Taiwan a few years later. China won observer status in 
GATT -- a prelude to full membership -- in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese army's massacre of political protesters in Tian An Men Square 
last June 3-4, followed by China's refusal to proceed further with economic 
reforms, has put that process on hold. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan applied for GATT membership Jan. 1 in an attempt to take advantage of 
worldwide reaction against the Tian An Men Square incident. To get around 
reluctance to admit Taiwan alone, it applied for membership as part of a 
customs union that includes three neighboring islands. 
</P>
<P>
Top Bush Administration economic policy-makers say they see no trade-related 
reasons for denying U.S. support to Taiwan. Taiwan already is a major U.S. 
trading partner and is rich with cash reserves. 
</P>
<P>
But they concede that the decision will be made mainly on political grounds. 
U.S. support of Taiwan's new bid would mark the furthest the United States has 
gone in a decade to confer formal status on Taiwan, which China still considers 
to be a renegade province. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials say the review being conducted by the National 
Security Council, expected to be completed shortly, will focus primarily on the 
implications of the move for U.S.-Chinese relations. The issue then goes to the 
President for a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress, already dissatisfied with the Administration's insistence 
on maintaining close contacts with China in the wake of the Tian An Men Square 
incident, have begun pressuring the White House to support Taiwan's 
application. 
</P>
<P>
In a bipartisan move, 23 members of the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee 
have written the President urging him to support Taiwan's bid. The move, they 
said, would "not only serve U.S. interests but also strengthen the trading 
system itself." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Finance Committee is drafting a similar letter.

16 WEST BANK COLLEGES TO REOPEN; 28 ARABS WOUNDED IN GAZA CLASH

<P>
Under pressure from the United States and the European Community, Israel said 
Monday that it will reopen 16 Arab community colleges ordered shut during most 
of the Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
But the army kept a closure order on six Palestinian universities with an 
enrollment of more than 22,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the most violent confrontation in the occupied territories in three 
weeks occurred in the Gaza Strip, where Arab reports said soldiers shot and 
wounded 28 Palestinians, including 22 in the Rafah refugee camp. 
</P>
<P>
U.N. relief workers said 38 other Palestinians from Rafah were treated for 
lesser injuries from rubber-coated metal pellets while about 100 people sought 
help for tear-gas inhalation after army helicopters sprayed the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
In the occupied West Bank, three Arabs were shot and wounded by Israeli troops 
during clashes in the town of Tulkarm, Arab reports and Israel Radio said. 
</P>
<P>
The order allowing community colleges and vocational schools to reopen will 
affect 16 West Bank schools with an enrollment of about 5,000 students, 
according to Shmuel Goren, coordinator for the Israeli military government in 
the occupied lands. All of the schools were ordered closed in January, 1988, 
after the army declared they were hotbeds of violence. 
</P>
<P>
Goren said the community and vocational colleges were reopened "to bring about 
some change in the climate and feelings" in the territories. "When we reach the 
conclusion that the universities will really be a place for study, we will 
reopen them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament voted last month to freeze scientific and technical 
cooperation with Israel until the universities are reopened, and at least two 
planned Israeli-European Community conferences have been postponed 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
The United States criticized continued closure of the universities in its 
annual human rights report last week.

Gale-force winds struck Western Europe on Monday, tearing down roofs and power 
lines, disrupting transportation on land, sea and air and killing at least 35 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Winds were clocked at 100 m.p.h. at Aberporth along the Scottish border, while 
Leeds in central England reported winds up to 98 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second major storm to strike Europe this year. Ninety-five people 
were killed Jan. 25 in winds that gusted up to 106 m.p.h. Wind speeds in late 
January and February were the strongest in 18 years, averaging 15 m.p.h. the 
last two weeks at Heathrow Airport, the London Weather Center said. 
</P>
<P>
Flood warnings were posted on the north coast of West Germany and parts of 
Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve deaths were reported in Britain, seven in West Germany and two in East 
Germany, five in Belgium, seven in France and one each in Ireland and the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
The dead included a driver whose double-decker bus hit a fallen tree, an 
elderly man killed by a falling chimney and an elderly woman struck by a slate 
blown from a roof, police and rescue workers said. 
</P>
<P>
A policeman on patrol in suburban Brussels was killed and a colleague was 
injured when a tree was blown onto their car. In northeastern Damme, Belgium, 
the roof of the tourism office collapsed, killing one worker and injuring 
another. Two people died when their home collapsed in Bekkevoort, Belgium. A 
motorist was also killed by a tree in Embourg near Liege. 
</P>
<P>
In Hamburg, West Germany, a 76-year-old woman was killed when winds pushed her 
in front of a moving car. In France, a 3-year-old girl was killed by a falling 
branch in Avesnes sur Helpes. 
</P>
<P>
Police imposed a 50-m.p.h. speed limit in some areas in Britain, and the 
Automobile Assn. advised motorists to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
The winds disrupted ferry service between Ireland and Wales, as well as between 
the British mainland and the Isle of Wight and Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
In the port of Antwerp, a river ship sank after a 15-ton crane fell onto the 
vessel, injuring several people. 
</P>
<P>
In the North Wales seaside town of Towyn, police were evacuating 2,000 people 
threatened by a high tide. Huge waves smashed a 200-yard hole in the seawall 
and sent a torrent cascading through the streets, flooding homes. 
</P>
<P>
Cuts in the overhead power lines halted some train traffic in Belgium, the 
state-owned railroad company said. Thousands of homes in Britain were without 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
At Heathrow Airport, many airlines were unable to load catered meals onto 
airplanes, and passengers were instead offered meals in the departure lounges. 
Authorities feared winds could upset the trucks that lift trays of prepared 
meals onto aircraft.

HAVEL RECALLS A WAVE FROM AN OLD FOE 
</P>

Seated next to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev amid the splendor and 
formality of an official Kremlin dinner, Czechoslovakia's puckish new president 
Vaclav Havel could not help recalling Monday that they had encountered one 
another nearly three years ago under very different circumstances -- when 
Gorbachev was visiting the Communist regime in Prague and Havel was a dissident 
playwright. 
</P>
<P>
"One evening when I was walking along the embankment (of the Charles River) 
where we live in Prague, I saw a crowd of people walking past the National 
Theater, and I went over to see what was happening," Havel recounted at a press 
conference later. 
</P>
<P>
"President Gorbachev had just attended a performance of the 'Bartered Bride' or 
something else, and I saw him leaving the theater. I stood a few steps away 
from him, and all of a sudden I found myself waving my hand at him. And, you 
know, at that time, I was a dissident." 
</P>
<P>
Not aware that Havel was, as the Soviet press described him as recently as six 
months ago, an enemy of socialism and a troublemaker, Gorbachev waved back just 
as spontaneously. The encounter so amused Havel that he wrote an essay on 
"meeting" Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev laughed at his story, Havel said, then recalled the 1987 trip in a 
more serious vein. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, he did not feel good in Prague," Havel quoted Gorbachev as 
telling him. "He felt the atmosphere was suffocating. He felt the tension 
manifested to him and the hopes that were pinned on him. And he was aware that 
this signaled a deep dissatisfaction of society with the regime then in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"I answered that, at that time, I was not too happy with the thrill (that) 
people showed toward him. I believed this was in the Czech tradition of 
expecting a savior to come from outside to protect us. I told him that, first 
of all, we must save ourselves through our own efforts, and he fully agreed." 
</P>
<P>
That trip -- bolstered by the advice of one of Gorbachev's most trusted aides, 
Ivan T. Frolov, who had lived in Prague for a number of years -- contributed 
significantly to the Kremlin's decision last autumn to withdraw its support 
publicly from the Czechoslovak Communist Party leadership under former 
President Gustav Husak, knowing that could bring its collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, speaking with reporters Monday after agreements were signed laying 
the basis for a "new relationship" between Moscow and Prague, described Havel 
as "a man open to dialogue about all problems, a realist with a sense of the 
future."

EDUCATOR GETS HARD POLITICAL LESSON; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN: BOSTON UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT JOHN SILBER'S POINTED STATEMENTS HAVE 
PLAGUED HIS CAMPAIGN FOR GOVERNOR. BUT SOME VOTERS LIKE WHAT THEY HEAR. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Whenever Boston University President John R. Silber opens his mouth in public 
these days, television cameras start rolling and reporters scoot a little 
closer to the edges of their seats. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that Silber has been a professional politician for only five weeks, 
and faces what appear to be almost insurmountable odds in his quest to become 
governor, it might seem a dream come true to have the news media hanging onto 
every utterance. 
</P>
<P>
But, for Silber, long one of higher education's most prominent and 
controversial figures, it shows just how much heat a man can generate with a 
campaign that he describes as "appealing to voters as a person who can write 
his own speeches and whose words are his own." 
</P>
<P>
Although Silber likes to describe himself as a "straight shooter," his words 
lately have tended to explode like cherry bombs. In the last few weeks, he has 
said: 
</P>
<P>
 -- That Massachusetts is a "welfare magnet" for "people who are accustomed to 
living in the tropical climate," with the town of Lowell becoming "the 
Cambodian capital of America." 
</P>
<P>
 -- That he decided against converting to Judaism after learning that "the 
racism of Jews is quite phenomenal" and that he could never be accepted fully 
in the faith. 
</P>
<P>
 -- That Jesse Jackson's speaking style reminds him of Adolf Hitler's, and 
that, if he were President of the United States, Jackson would "have a place in 
my Cabinet, because every President needs someone to write bumper stickers." 
</P>
<P>
 -- That too many children are needlessly being placed in special-education 
programs, which "would lead one to believe that there has been a collapse of 
the gene pool in Massachusetts, because 17 1/2% of our kids are weird, are not 
capable of being educated under normal circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Silber, who is running a close third in the polls in a four-candidate race for 
the Democratic nomination, insists that many of these statements have been 
taken out of context and blown out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
When he told a group that drugs present a greater threat to society than 
alcohol, for example, the Boston Sunday Herald bannered the headline, "NEW 
SILBER SHOCKER: Gov Candidate in More Hot Water for Pooh-poohing Alcoholism." 
In fact, Silber never suggested that alcohol abuse is not a problem and has 
even advocated confiscating the automobiles of people convicted of drunk 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
But part of the blame lies in the combative Silber's own insistence on using 
language as a bludgeon, a style that invites disaster in an era in which any 
phrase can become a "sound bite" on the evening news. His concern about placing 
too many children in special-education programs mirrors that of many other 
educators, for example, but the words he used to express it struck many as 
harsh and insensitive. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the difficulties have been caused, I think, by an irresponsible press. 
Others have been caused by my own naivete and the mistakes I have made," Silber 
admitted in an interview, adding that he hopes to run a "bomb-proof" campaign 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Still, although his choice of words has backfired, some say that his campaign 
has given voice to a frustration and anti-Establishment backlash that have been 
building in this state for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, I agree with most of his ideas, and especially with shooting 
straight. It's about time people said some things that needed to be said for a 
long time," said Jim Vallee, a 23-year-old Boston law student who describes 
himself as a liberal Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
"What he says makes a lot of sense to me," added Lou Alberghini, a 66-year-old 
retired consultant from Malden. "I'm registered independent and tend to vote 
for Republicans, but, in this case, I'll probably switch." 
</P>
<P>
The embarrassment that Massachusetts citizens felt over the trouncing of Gov. 
Michael S. Dukakis in the 1988 presidential race turned to rage when they 
learned that their state economy had been crumbling even as he had traveled the 
country touting the "Massachusetts miracle." Dukakis has since decided not to 
run for reelection, and lawmakers here have become the target of scorn as they 
have fumbled every attempt to find a solution to what has become a full-blown 
fiscal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
With once-robust companies laying off workers, confidence in business has 
plummeted. And the reputations of the news media and law-enforcement agencies 
were badly bruised when they got snookered in the sensational case of Charles 
Stuart, who concocted a story of a black assailant to cover his apparent own 
guilt in his wife's murder. 
</P>
<P>
Silber is the only political newcomer in a Democratic field that includes 
former Atty. Gen. Francis X. Bellotti, the front-runner, Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy 
and state Rep. John H. Flood, chairman of the Legislature's Taxation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Silber, a native Texan, came to Boston University almost two decades ago, after 
being fired as dean of the University of Texas' College of Arts and Sciences. 
At that time, he was lionized as a heroic liberal whose outspokenness and 
independence had cost him his job. 
</P>
<P>
His admirers speak of how he has changed Boston University from a backwater 
commuter school into a powerhouse that attracts top students and faculty from 
across the country. In a poll of college educators several years ago, Silber 
was ranked as one of the nation's five most effective private college and 
university presidents. His salary, approaching $300,000 a year, is said to be 
the highest of any of this country's college presidents. (Silber is currently 
on a leave of absence.) 
</P>
<P>
But others contend that Silber has created more problems than he has solved. 
They describe his administration as a reign of terror and intimidation and say 
he stops at nothing to impose his standards and philosophy on the institution. 
Early in his tenure, Silber called in police to quash a student demonstration 
against Marine Corps recruiters that he had invited to the campus. In 1976, 10 
of the university's 15 deans and several hundred faculty members demanded his 
resignation, but Silber prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
"He's handling his (gubernatorial) campaign the way he handles Boston 
University. We became very accustomed to being treated in a very belittling, 
contemptuous, sometimes insulting way," said Bernice Buresh, a former associate 
professor of journalism at the school. Buresh resigned in 1988 in a dispute 
over Silber's decision to have the journalism school sponsor a 
U.S.-government-financed program to train Afghan rebels to use propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
Even Silber's admirers say he can be hard to take. Former Secretary of State 
Henry A. Kissinger, who served with Silber on a presidential commission on 
Central America, put it this way in an interview with the New York Times 
Magazine last year: "When he first started, my only question was, if I killed 
him, would it be considered murder or justifiable homicide? He is very fierce 
in his convictions. He takes no prisoners. I swore I'd kill him, and then, as 
the weeks went by, I grew extremely fond of him." 
</P>
<P>
When Silber entered the race last month, it was clear that he would bring this 
confrontational style to politics. The sparks started flying only a few days 
later, when, in an interview with the Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette, Silber 
demanded: "Why has Massachusetts suddenly become so popular for people who are 
accustomed to living in the tropical climate? Amazing." Further, he asked why 
Lowell, a city that has received more than 25,000 Cambodian refugees over the 
last five years, should be "the Cambodian capital of America? It is 
extraordinary. Why should they all be concentrated in one place? This needs to 
be examined." 
</P>
<P>
"What Silber should study," retorted his opponent Murphy, "is the dark recesses 
of his own mind." However, a poll by the Boston Globe and WBZ-TV found more 
than half of the respondents thought Silber's statements had "some merit." 
</P>
<P>
Although the public mood may boost an outsider's chances in Massachusetts 
politics these days, the system of nominating candidates does not. Before 
Silber can be listed on the ballot for the September primary, he must win the 
support of at least 15% of the delegates to a statewide Democratic convention 
in June -- a gathering that will be dominated by party stalwarts. 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he might do better running as a Republican, in a party whose 
last two presidential candidates he has supported, Silber insisted: "Certainly 
not! I'm a Democrat, and identifiably a Democrat. Moreover, I'm a liberal 
Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to actually practicing politics, he admitted: "I'm Johnny in 
the first reader, and the book is a little bit longer than I thought it was."

NORIEGA TRIAL DELAYED FOR NINE MONTHS; 
</P>
<P>
COURT: JUDGE'S RULING IS BASED ON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CASE. DEFENSE LAWYERS 
SAY THE DEPOSED DICTATOR WILL PROBABLY TESTIFY.

<P>
A federal judge, acknowledging the complexity of the case, Monday postponed for 
almost nine months the trial of Manuel A. Noriega as attorneys for the ousted 
dictator prepared a defense that they said would probably include Noriega's 
taking the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
"Our principal objective is to have everybody ready for trial in a fair 
manner," said U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler, setting the new trial 
date for Nov. 30. The trial had been scheduled to begin March 5. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney David Lewis complained that even late November was "not 
feasible, not possible" for trial on 11 counts alleging international drug 
smuggling. He said defense lawyers must still obtain and study thousands of 
secret U.S. documents that may relate to Noriega's past involvement as an 
undercover informant for the CIA, the Drug Enforcement Administration and 
perhaps other intelligence agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The former Panamanian strongman is expected to claim that U.S. agents 
authorized or at least condoned his cooperation with Colombian drug gangs as 
long as he furnished valuable information on many of their activities. 
</P>
<P>
Taking note of Lewis' objections, Hoeveler said that "if expansion is needed, 
expansion will be granted . . . but in no event will this trial start later 
than January, 1991." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was learned that federal prosecutors are stepping up efforts to 
persuade Lt. Col. Luis A. del Cid, a former confidant and military aide to 
Noriega, to plead guilty in the drug-conspiracy case and become a witness for 
the government against his former commander. 
</P>
<P>
Del Cid is among five co-defendants in U.S. custody who are seeking a separate 
trial from Noriega. Talks with Del Cid's Miami lawyer, Samuel I. Burstyn, began 
shortly after Noriega's surrender to U.S. authorities on Jan. 3. But, in recent 
days, "they're offering Del Cid the moon," according to a source familiar with 
the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Burstyn acknowledged some progress but said that no plea agreement had been 
reached. Del Cid could be a crucial witness for the government because, 
according to the 1988 federal indictment, he was an intermediary who received 
cash payoffs for Noriega from leaders of the Medellin drug cartel who wished to 
use Panama as a transshipment point for U.S.-bound cocaine deliveries. The 
cartel also established cocaine-processing laboratories in Panama with 
Noriega's blessing, the indictment charged. 
</P>
<P>
In commenting on reports of a possible deal, Noriega attorney Steve Kollin 
said: "We'll wait to see if there's a plea before we worry about it." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, in discussing possible testimony by Noriega, said the general had 
received substantial "foreign intelligence" over the years from countries other 
than the United States, including Israel and Libya. 
</P>
<P>
But James McAdams, a Justice Department attorney, told the court that such 
intelligence would be subject to U.S. review before Noriega could use it at 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
McAdams asked Hoeveler to mandate such a review in an order he is preparing on 
measures to prevent disclosure of secret materials at the trial. But Lewis 
objected that such a directive would go beyond provisions of the federal 
Classified Information Procedures Act, which Congress enacted 10 years ago to 
govern the use of top-secret documents in criminal trials. Hoeveler took the 
arguments under advisement.

PANEL OKS $500-MILLION OIL SPILL FUND 
</P>

A bill to set up a $500-million superfund paid for by oil company fees to clean 
up offshore oil spills was approved Monday by the Assembly Committee on Natural 
Resources. 
</P>
<P>
An 8-1 vote sent the measure, which received new impetus from the recent 
Huntington Beach oil spill, to the Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't trust the oil industry to cover the damages of a spill," said 
Controller Gray Davis, a member of the sponsoring State Lands Commission. "You 
can't trust their assurances that oil spills won't happen and they will clean 
it up if one occurs." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation calls for a 50-cents-per-barrel fee to be imposed on crude oil 
shipped into California by tankers. There would be lesser fees for oil brought 
ashore by pipelines from drilling platforms. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the cleanup superfund, the bill would establish a new state 
office to coordinate all oil spill response efforts, require tanker safety and 
emergency plans at every oil transfer terminal in California and require 
unannounced tanker inspections and emergency drills. 
</P>
<P>
"Our coastline, once known for its beauty, is now known for dead birds and 
other remnants of oil spills," said Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo), who 
introduced the measure. 
</P>
<P>
In defense of the proposed $500-million superfund, the chairman of the Assembly 
Select Committee on Oil Spill Prevention and Response Preparedness said, "The 
first 48 hours are absolutely critical and the money must be readily available 
for oil spill cleanup purposes." 
</P>
<P>
But a major oil company representative, Michael B. Kahl, speaking for the 
Western States Petroleum Assn., questioned the need for such a large superfund. 
"We cannot justify this large amount of money just sitting in a fund," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative, Kahl suggested keeping $10 million on hand in the superfund 
and adding a borrowing authority to obtain more money if needed when a spill 
occurs. Kahl said any loans would be repaid by imposing additional fees on the 
industry. He also said his clients would rather have national oil spill 
prevention standards set by the federal government instead of trying to abide 
by conflicting state requirements.

MONEY NEEDED TO FIGHT THE ASH WHITEFLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Last fall's biological warfare experiment against the ash whitefly, which has 
attacked trees in at least 15 California counties, was successful in killing 
the destructive pests, researchers reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
However, ash whitefly experts said they need more money to continue the 
research that could provide a long-term solution to the ash whitefly problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We could really be set back if the University of California was unable to 
continue its research," said Peter J. Stoddard, statewide coordinator for the 
Department of Food and Agriculture's ash whitefly project. "It's kind of hard 
to keep ahead of this insect." 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture departments throughout Southern California, including Orange 
County's, have funded the research. But agricultural commissioners said funding 
also needs to come from other parts of California because the problem has 
become statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Resendez, a Southern California spokesman for the Nursery Growers Assn. 
of California, said his group plans to lobby state legislators for additional 
support. "It's really important to our industry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fight against the ash whitefly is being waged with imported parasitic 
wasps, one of the whitefly's natural enemies. About 300 wasps were dispersed in 
small groups last fall. 
</P>
<P>
The wasps destroy the fly either by attacking it or implanting it with eggs 
that consume the fly from the inside out as the egg matures. 
</P>
<P>
The microscopic wasps, which do not grow stingers, have been the best weapon 
against the pinhead-size flies, which have been unaffected by pesticides since 
being discovered in Southern California 19 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bellows, a UC Riverside entomologist who is heading the biological 
eradication research team, said the researchers were "very pleased" with the 
wasps' performance. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Food and Agriculture, in joint effort with the UC Riverside 
researchers, plans to disperse thousands of additional wasps this spring in a 
full-scale attack against the flies. The pest, which attacks trees by sucking 
the juice from leaves, has so far affected apple, peach, pear, plum, apricot, 
pomegranate, lime and kumquat trees. 
</P>
<P>
But Bellows warned against relying solely on the wasps to wipe out the billions 
of flies in the Southland. He encouraged the development of additional natural 
enemies of the flies, such as an imported beetle, which are currently being 
studied at UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot that we don't know about the natural enemy of this bug," he 
said. "It will take repreated and consistent effort."

MAN GIVEN 2 MORE YEARS IN SEX CASE; 
</P>
<P>
SENTENCE: THE PENALTY FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT ON A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL BROUGHT THE TERM 
NOW FACED BY A DEFENDANT CONVICTED IN AN EARLIER CASE TO 25 YEARS.

<P>
A former consumer marketing manager for the Los Angeles Times, serving a 
23-year sentence for sexually assaulting two young girls, was given two 
additional years in prison Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The two years were added in exchange for a guilty plea by Thomas Scarth 
McVickers in the case of a third victim, a 13-year-old girl. McVickers now 
faces a total of 25 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing, by Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown, disappointed the 
prosecutor in the case, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ariadne J. Symons, who had hoped 
that the charges would result in an additional 10 years on his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not enough for what this man has done," she said of the 25-year sentence 
McVickers now has. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that McVickers, now 43, of Anaheim, picked up some of his 
victims -- either hitchhikers or runaways -- while driving the Los Angeles 
Times van assigned to him. He allegedly told his victims that he was a 
professional photographer who could help them get started with modeling 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
One alleged victim told the police that McVickers had told her he was "a 
photographer-interviewer for The Times, looking for attractive female models." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Times Orange County edition circulation office said 
McVickers was in charge of a crew of sales people and was assigned a van as 
part of his duties. McVickers was employed by The Times from April 26, 1983, to 
May 4, 1989, although he had been in Orange County Jail since his arrest in 
March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
McVickers wrote to the court last year that he never meant to commit any 
crimes, but that he simply "gave in to temptation when opportunities presented 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
One of the victims, whose case was part of McVickers' first trial, was only 12 
years old when she posed for him and was forced to have sex. The girl was the 
daughter of a woman McVickers had been living with at the time. The second 
victim was 15 when she first had sex with McVickers. 
</P>
<P>
The police alleged that there were several other victims not included in the 
original charges either because they would not cooperate or because of statute 
of limitation problems. But Symons did manage to file new charges involving one 
more victim, the 13-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
Symons said that the victim in the new charges could have been included in the 
first trial but that the parameters of that case had already been decided 
before she was assigned the case. Symons said she decided to go after McVickers 
at a new trial because she believed that his 23-year sentence was not proper 
punishment for him. 
</P>
<P>
"This man should never be out on the streets again," she said. "This is a man 
who hates women." 
</P>
<P>
McVickers' attorney, William Morrissey, declined to comment on Judge Brown's 
sentence. Symons, though unhappy, claiming that two more years was inadequate, 
said there were reasons behind it. 
</P>
<P>
"Judge Brown is faced with having to deal a lot of cases because of courtrooms 
already overcrowded with trials," she said. "He may have decided that 25 years 
total was enough for these charges. But I don't agree." 
</P>
<P>
Brown runs the calendar courtroom for Superior Court -- where almost all felony 
cases are either resolved or sent out for trial -- and is faced with daily plea 
bargaining. Monday, for example, Brown had more than 90 cases in his courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Symons added that even if it was just two more years, it was worth the effort 
because it will cause at least a year's delay in McVickers' release.

PSYCHIATRIC CARE SOUGHT FOR SUSPECT

A hearing for Cordell L. Robb, the Loara High School student accused of 
shooting a boy in the face and holding a drama class hostage, was postponed 
Monday to allow time for his attorney to get more information on psychiatric 
care available in the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Gary L. Proctor, a private attorney appointed by the court to represent Robb, 
said he is looking for reassurances that his client can receive adequate 
psychiatric care. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been our position all along that this boy needs psychiatric help," 
Proctor said. "Before we make any agreements with the district attorney, we 
need to have an evaluation of the type of care available for Cory or else 
there's no reason for sending him there." 
</P>
<P>
Robb, 15, reportedly beset with family problems, is accused of attempted 
murder, assault with a deadly weapon, five counts of false imprisonment and 
bringing a firearm onto school grounds. If convicted, he could be imprisoned in 
the California Youth Authority until he turns 25. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very serious concerns that he's a schizophrenic," Proctor said. 
"What's the point of agreeing to some prison time when they won't be able to 
help him?" 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe Nedza said the prosecution was ready for trial Monday. 
But Nedza said he "understood the court's reasoning for the delay." 
</P>
<P>
Juvenile Court Judge Robert B. Hutson set a pretrial hearing for March 8, and 
tentatively scheduled Robb's trial for March 21.

5,000 GALLONS OF GAS SPILL AT FUEL FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Almost 5,000 gallons of gasoline were spilled Monday morning at a Mobil Oil 
Corp. fuel facility in Anaheim when a shut-off valve malfunctioned, a company 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
By late Monday, 3,000 gallons of gasoline had been recovered, said Jim 
Carbonetti, public affairs manager for Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the 5:35 a.m. incident at the gasoline and diesel-fuel 
distribution terminal in the 1400 block of North Jefferson Avenue. The spilled 
fuel was contained in an overflow dike, and it posed no threat to the 
environment, Anaheim Fire Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the accident, gasoline was being transferred from a pipeline to 
an above-ground storage tank designed to hold more than 50,000 gallons of fuel. 
The pipeline originates at a company facility in Vernon, Carbonetti said. He 
added that the spill will not affect Mobil's gasoline supply. 
</P>
<P>
Protective berms around the storage tank prevented the fuel from leaving the 
immediate area, Carbonetti added. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters and hazardous-materials crews from the county and the cities of 
Anaheim and Orange spent nearly two hours covering the spill with a protective 
foam. A private company was called in to "vacuum" the spill, Carbonetti said. 
</P>
<P>
Police closed off nearby Orangethorpe and Tustin avenues to traffic during the 
cleanup operation to reduce the possibility of igniting the fumes, a Fire 
Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil's Anaheim distribution facility receives gasoline from company pipelines. 
Its storage tanks are used to load tanker trucks that deliver fuel to service 
stations. WENDY PAULSON

FIRM TO HELP WEIGH HIGH-SPEED RAIL BIDS

An Anaheim engineering and consulting firm has been selected by the 
California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission as one of five companies that 
will evaluate bids for building and operating a 300-m.p.h. rail system between 
Las Vegas and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Willdan Associates has been selected, along with corporations from Southern 
California, Nevada, Colorado and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals to privately build and operate the train system are expected from 
Bechtel International of San Francisco, Morrison-Knudsen Co. of Boise, Idaho, 
and Bombardier Corp. of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The bistate commission is scheduled to choose a proposal in October. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is scheduled between 1993 and 1997, although skeptics have said 
the train system cannot be built for the $4-billion estimated so far. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Anaheim City Council on Tuesday will discuss giving the 
commission $200,000. Although state law mandates that the train be privately 
financed, public funds may be used in developing the project. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's executive director asked the city for funding this year to 
help identify the most attractive contractor for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas and Clark County, Nev., are expected to give $85,000 each to the 
commission this year, and the Las Vegas Convention/Visitors Authority is 
expected to provide another $250,000. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN and LISA MASCARO

MOCK-UP OF SPACECRAFT GETS A HOME

<P>
A mock-up of a space-station module has been saved from the scrap heap and will 
become part of the Newport Beach Museum of Natural History and Science, 
officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The space module, a model of what will be a future home for astronauts, was 
rescued through a collaborative effort of the museum, the El Toro Marine Corps 
Air Station and the McDonnell Douglas Co. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-foot-long, 14-foot-high original model of the living quarters of the 
U.S. Space Station Freedom, which was built by McDonnell Douglas in Huntington 
Beach in 1986, would have been destroyed if a new home had not been found by 
today, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials were immediately interested in the module, which they said 
would highlight a space exhibit planned for this summer. However, the museum 
couldn't immediately accept the bulky module due to cramped quarters at 
Eastbluff Elementary School, where the museum is temporarily located. It is to 
be moved to a new building in May. 
</P>
<P>
A frenzied search for a place to store the mock-up began Feb. 16 and ended 
Friday when the El Toro Marine base agreed to house the module in an airplane 
hangar until the museum's move is complete and the exhibit space is ready. The 
module takes up about 2,500 square feet of space. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the storage agreement was reached, officials were still racing the 
clock Monday to get the necessary city permits to allow transfer of the 
15-foot-wide capsule through city streets early this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Transporting the fragile piece of space history requires considerable care, 
according to Jonathon E. Ericson, a UCI professor of social ecology who 
orchestrated the module's transfer from Huntington Beach to El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's absolutely no damage, it will just be the most incredible thing," 
Ericson said. "It would be like moving an open pillowcase without dropping a 
feather, literally." 
</P>
<P>
Museum Executive Director Dudley Varner said Monday that the module, which is 
open on both ends to allow visitors to walk through the mock-up, will be an 
important part of future displays. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives you a very intriguing feeling to walk through it and to know that 
someday there will be six people sharing quarters in this man-made thing 
floating around in space," Varner said. 
</P>
<P>
The museum will move in May to either Costa Mesa or Santa Ana. In about five 
years, officials say, the museum will relocate to its final home, a 
100,000-square-foot facility on a 25-acre site at Aliso-Wood Canyons Park in 
Aliso Viejo. LESLIE EARNEST

GROUP BACKING UCI HOUSING PLAN MEETS

A small group of activists gathered at UC Irvine on Monday to support a 
decision preventing gays and lesbians from living together in graduate-student 
housing. They were confronted by a much larger group of protesters, but no 
trouble developed. 
</P>
<P>
The smaller group, which numbered about 10, carried a petition signed by other 
residents of the university's Verano Place apartments to support Chancellor 
Jack W. Peltason's ruling that the university would not allow homosexuals, 
lesbians and other non-traditional couples to live in family housing on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"The chancellor has been pressured by the gay and lesbian community," said 
protest organizer Deanne Frakes, 22, a resident of the Verano complex. "We just 
wanted him to know that he doesn't have to give in to demands." 
</P>
<P>
Peltason's supporters took the petition to his office after their short meeting 
outside the school administration building. However, Peltason was out of town, 
university spokeswoman Linda Granell said. 
</P>
<P>
The petition, signed by 150 Verano residents, also asks Peltason and the 
university to provide campus housing only to those with marriage licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, students had erected a cardboard shantytown to protest the 
school's housing policy that bans homosexual couples. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the shantytown organizers descended en masse near where their opponents 
had gathered. They carried banners and formed lines on either side of those 
carrying the petition. The larger shantytown group remained silent, and no 
confrontation occurred. 
</P>
<P>
However, one of the 10 activists said she received two phone threats as a 
result of her participation Monday to support the university's stance on 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the shantytown activists remained passive Monday, some said they were 
outraged by a flyer distributed to promote another protest today at the 
university's Student Council meeting. The flyer said in part: "What's this 
world coming to. . . . Unmarried couples in MARRIED student family housing." 
</P>
<P>
"Their common argument is that we'll recruit children into our 'deviant' life 
style," said shantytown student organizer Jacqueline Sowell. DANICA KIRKA

TRUSTEES TO VOTE ON RELOCATION OF SCHOOL

Huntington Beach Union High School District trustees are expected to vote 
tonight on whether to move Wintersburg Continuation High School to the campus 
of Fountain Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
For months, angry Fountain Valley parents have been protesting the proposed 
relocation of the school, which serves students with behavioral, academic and 
attendance problems. 
</P>
<P>
Wintersburg is now next door to Ocean View High School in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just stressing that these kids obviously have problems -- that's why 
they are at Wintersburg in the first place," said Corlie Guild, leader of the 
30-member Fountain Valley group opposing the move. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way, with them putting the two schools so close together, that the 
two groups of kids won't be mingling, and what happens with this is that kids 
on the borderline at Fountain Valley will be tempted to cross over." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed lease of the land now occupied by Wintersburg is a part of the 
district's effort to raise revenues in the wake of declining enrollment. The 
district stands to earn $1 million a year on a 60-year lease of Wintersburg and 
15 acres that surround the school, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley school districts have been hit hard 
by declining enrollment. The Fountain Valley school district has had to close 
eight schools during the last 10 years. ALLISON SAMUELS

COUNCIL SUED OVER ELECTION DECISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual action Monday, City Clerk Mary Wynn sued the City Council in an 
attempt to force it to approve polling places, precincts and precinct boards 
for the scheduled April 10 election. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which names the four individual council members, the council as a 
body and the city, is necessary so that Wynn can prepare for the election, City 
Atty. James G. Rourke said. The council deadlocked last week on the election 
details, usually a routine matter. Councilmen John Kelly and Earl J. Prescott, 
who oppose holding the elections in April instead of in November, voted against 
a resolution to approve the election details. 
</P>
<P>
The state election code and state law require City Council members to approve 
such details 29 days before the scheduled election, or March 12 in this case, 
said Robert Owen of the Costa Mesa law firm Rutan &amp; Tucker, which is 
handling the suit for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Commissioner Julian Cimbaluk set a March 9 hearing date for the 
case, although Prescott and Kelly asked that the hearing be delayed until the 
city retains a defense attorney to represent them. 
</P>
<P>
Prescott said that state law entitles him to a lawyer and pointed out that 
former Councilman Ronald B. Hoesterey was allowed to choose his own attorney 
when Prescott and Kelly filed a suit against him, contesting his residency. 
</P>
<P>
Rourke said a decision has not been made about whether to hire defense 
attorneys for Prescott and Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
"If the City Council decides to hire someone and pay for their defense, they 
can," Owen said. 
</P>
<P>
Prescott and Kelly say this latest suit is a good chance to settle the question 
of Hoesterey's residency at the time of the Nov. 20 meeting, the date when the 
council majority voted to move elections to April. Although the suit by 
Prescott and Kelly was dismissed in January, the judge never ruled on the 
residency question. 
</P>
<P>
Prescott and Kelly say that if the court rules that Hoesterey was not a 
resident at the time of his vote on the election change, the April 10 election 
date is invalid. But Owen said that will not be decided in this case. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a specific action to throw out a law," Owen said, adding that the 
issue of Hoesterey's residency is irrelevant in this case.SHANNON SANDS

OIL RESIDUE STAINS WETLANDS, BUT DAMAGE IS BELIEVED MINIMAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A wafer-thin layer of oily residue glistened in the waterways and ringed the 
nesting islands of the Huntington Beach Wetlands on Monday, but biologists 
expressed optimism that damage might be minimal to the 25-acre wildlife habitat 
near the Santa Ana River mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that we've got permanent damage," said Gary Gorman, executive 
director of the Huntington Beach Wetlands Conservancy, an environmental group 
that is restoring the once-neglected salt marsh. "I think the oil that got in 
there will eventually dissipate." 
</P>
<P>
But the presence of oil in the ecologically delicate refuge, and the sight of 
dozens of cleanup workers on Monday dabbing at the fouled waterways that lead 
to the open ocean half a mile away, was disheartening for environmentalists. 
Protecting coastal wetlands from 394,000 gallons of oil that spilled from the 
ruptured tanker American Trader on Feb. 7 had been a priority. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to seal off marshes and refuges that dot Orange County's coast had 
largely succeeded until Sunday, when an extremely high morning tide combined 
with large swells to demolish a sand dike and snap a series of protective 
booms, sending waves of frothy brown residue up the Talbert Channel to the 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of oil that contaminated the wetlands is relatively small -- less 
than 10 gallons by one estimate. However, some impact is expected, and several 
experts suggested that even a little oil could be damaging because the newly 
restored marsh is small and underdeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the oil that's in there will probably do some unquantifiable damage," 
Gorman said. "It'll coat the plants. Some of them will die. Some of it will 
probably get into the mud. Some of the invertebrates will probably die." 
</P>
<P>
Scores of migrating waterfowl use the refuge to feed and nest, including a pair 
of endangered species, the California least tern and Beldings savannah sparrow. 
</P>
<P>
After inspecting the marsh, Duane Maxwell, a water quality biologist for the 
state Department of Fish and Game, concluded: "I don't think it's badly oiled." 
Most of the "light sheen" was packed against the eastern edge of the marsh and 
Maxwell said, "if they work at it, I don't think it will be difficult" to clean 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Besides deploying about 75 cleanup workers to the marsh, British Petroleum, 
which owned the spilled oil, used three large vacuum trucks with long hoses to 
skim the sheen from the water. But no decision was reached on whether to mop up 
the residue that surrounded the flat nesting islands like a bathtub ring. 
Environmentalists warned that walking on the mud flats could cause more harm. 
</P>
<P>
British Petroleum officials said that Sunday's tidal surge ironically helped 
scrub oil-coated rocks in the jetties that separate the Talbert Channel from 
the Santa Ana River. As a result, the company predicted that cleanup efforts in 
the channel and around the river mouth may be completed within two weeks -- 
rather than four to six weeks as previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wanted to see that wetlands harmed," company spokesman Chuck Webster 
said. "But Mother Nature may have delivered a blessing in disguise. Those waves 
in a single day did what it might have taken us a week or more to accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
Approximately 10 miles of beaches -- in various stages of cleanup -- remained 
closed Monday from the Newport Pier north to Bolsa Chica State Beach at Warner 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
In a move toward reopening beaches, technicians from an Anaheim-based firm were 
testing dozens of samples of sand for hydrocarbons and possible carcinogens. 
Med-Tox Associates Inc. has been hired by British Petroleum to scoop up samples 
of sand every 500 feet from Corona del Mar to Anaheim Bay. The testing, 
required by local municipalities and county health officials, is the last step 
before beaches can be reopened to the public.

PLANNERS APPROVE SOS MOVE IN 3-2 VOTE;

CHARITY: BUT CONTROVERSY CONTINUED TO DOG THE AGENCY AS THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

<P>
After nearly three hours of debate, the Planning Commission voted 3 to 2 Monday 
to approve a permit that would allow the controversial charity Share Our Selves 
to move into new quarters. 
</P>
<P>
It will now be up to the City Council to decide whether the charity will be 
permitted to relocate to a vacant, 12,000-square-foot building at 1550 Superior 
Ave. in a southwest section of town dotted with commercial and light industrial 
businesses. The council is expected to take up the issue at its meeting next 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
SOS directors are hoping that the move away from residential neighborhoods will 
quiet complaints about the large numbers of homeless people who use the agency. 
</P>
<P>
But the charity continues to be dogged by controversy and opposition. In the 
latest salvo fired in what is beginning to look like an endless war, the Costa 
Mesa Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Planning Commission opposing the 
move on the ground that it would be detrimental to area businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"We were notified by a number of area businesses who wanted us to take a 
position against the move," said chamber president Russell G. Gilbert. "SOS is 
a worthwhile organization . . . but if you hurt business, you increase the 
ranks of poor and unemployed." 
</P>
<P>
The action by the chamber's board of directors sparked an internal dispute, 
with at least one member, former chamber president Arthur G. Kidman, denouncing 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was an expedient kind of action," said Kidman, a Costa Mesa 
attorney and longtime SOS supporter. "The chamber is struggling to maintain and 
boost its membership, and there is a feeling it needs to be up front in taking 
some positions. It was a self-serving attempt to boost membership." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Gilbert, Kidman argued that the chamber should not merely 
represent the "narrow money interests of business," pointing out that SOS 
founder and executive director Jean Forbath has been honored as the chamber's 
Woman of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
But business owners and residents of Anchor Trailer Port, near the proposed 
site, said they agreed with the chamber's position and feared the impact of 
SOS's move. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are they moving? Because people object to what they are doing to their 
(neighborhood) environment," Bob Lin, manager of the mobile home park, said 
before the Planning Commission meeting. "If they come to our neighborhood, we 
will have to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
Lin said mobile home owners fear that those served by SOS will increase crime, 
litter and traffic in the area. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a group from Newport Beach also appeared at Monday night's 
meeting, bearing a petition containing the signatures of 90 or so residents 
Park Lido condominiums, which is several blocks from the charity's proposed new 
home. The residents claim that they, too, will suffer from the SOS move. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old charity agency provides food, clothing, medical and financial 
assistance to about 20,000 people per month. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted to oust SOS from its longtime home at the Rea Community 
Center on Hamilton Street after nearby residents complained about the actions 
of some of those served by SOS. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy generated an outpouring of moral and financial support for the 
charity, allowing it to sign a purchase agreement for the building on Superior 
Avenue.

RESIDENTS OPPOSE NEW DEVELOPMENT 
</P>

MISSION VIEJO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 opponents of a proposed theater development overflowed City 
Council chambers Monday, urging the council to overrule its Planning Commission 
and amend the proposed development. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic problem we have is that this is going to create a lot more vehicle 
traffic and a lot of foot traffic as well," said David Hunt, a 10-year resident 
of Mission Viejo and one of those who spoke against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The project, designed and proposed by the Mission Viejo Co., would create more 
than 158,000 square feet of offices, retail stores and restaurants, as well as 
a service station and a six-screen movie theater. It was approved by the 
Planning Commission earlier this month, but the commission attached 75 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Peterson, director of Environmental Planning for the Mission Viejo Co., 
said Monday that the company accepts the conditions and is prepared to go ahead 
with the project. "The Mission Viejo Co. is very proud of this project," 
Peterson said. "It will be a good neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, residents remained concerned about several aspects of the 
project, particularly the movie theater. Several residents complained that it 
would increase traffic and place additional burdens on law enforcement.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: ALTAMIRANO IMPROVES SHOT BY TAKING TIME OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gene Altamirano and the three-point shot have been pretty good company this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Altamirano, a 6-foot-4 sophomore forward at Rancho Santiago 
College, set the single-season and career records from beyond the 19-9 line. 
</P>
<P>
He had a better shooting percentage on three-point attempts than on two-point 
tries this season. 
</P>
<P>
Things weren't so good last season. Altamirano struggled with his shooting, 
especially from long range. He made only 31.4% of his three-point attempts and 
shot 40.4% overall. 
</P>
<P>
"It just didn't feel right," said Altamirano, who averaged 11 1/2 points a game 
last season. "That was the worst season I've ever had. But with all the 
practice and games, I couldn't take time to just sit down and take a long look 
at what I was doing wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Altamirano was coming back to basketball after taking a year off after 
graduating from Los Amigos High School. Summer break finally afforded 
Altamirano the time to take his faulty jump shot to shooting coach Des Flood, 
and the pair worked out the problem. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Altamirano's three-point shot has helped Rancho Santiago to a 27-3 
record. The Dons open the Southern California regional playoffs against Los 
Angeles Harbor at 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday at Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Twice this season, Altamirano made six three-pointers in a game, the latest 
against Saddleback in an 83-75 victory Feb. 3, to break the single-game and 
career school records. He set single-season records for shots and attempts 
while making 86 of 160 (53.8%) field goals. He also set career records 
(124-280) in the same categories. 
</P>
<P>
Altamirano managed his record-setting performances despite opposing coaches' 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
"All year I had people trying to deny me the ball and then flying at me once I 
had it," Altamirano said. "I just had to work harder to get open for my shot." 
</P>
<P>
All this talk about the three-pointer might lead one to believe that Altamirano 
is a one-dimensional player. Actually, he is one of the best defensive players 
around. Last season, he was his team's defensive player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"People have a tendency to look at his three-point shooting and focus on that," 
Rancho Santiago Coach Dana Pagett said. "But he plays the total game. He feeds 
into the post well, he runs well and always hustles. He a more complete player 
than people realize." 
</P>
<P>
Nice start: Fullerton's 6-3 baseball victory over Golden West Saturday in the 
Orange Empire Conference opener was much more pleasant for Hornet Coach Nick 
Fuscardo than the last conference game his team played last May. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton was leading first-place Cypress, 4-1, going into the ninth inning. 
Fullerton could have played spoilers against Cypress, forcing a three-way tie 
for the conference championship with the victory. But Cypress rallied for five 
runs, including a game-winning two-run home run by Jason Friedman. The loss 
dropped Fullerton to 12-27. 
</P>
<P>
With Saturday's victory, Fullerton already is 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a good feeling to know we are going to be more competitive," 
Fuscardo said. "I knew we would be good and that's a nice feeling after last 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast College's softball team is off to an 8-1 start, led by four 
players batting .400 or better. Cathy Scanlan leads with a .484 (15 of 31) 
average, Kellie Newcombe is at .458 (11-24), Kristin Heizer is at .414 (12-29), 
and Wendy Robinson is at .400 (10-25). Heizer also is 8-0 as a pitcher. . . . 
Julie Ortman has resigned as the women's volleyball coach at Fullerton to take 
the same job at Humboldt State. Ortman was 26-11 in two seasons at Fullerton.

The last time John Armijo fought at the Irvine Marriott, in August, he brought

Monday night, Armijo again got the spectators out of their seats, but this time 
it was with a series of antics that included three wrestling-style takedowns. 
</P>

Armijo, a lifeguard from Huntington Beach who was returning from a hand injury, 
won a split decision over Lloyd Weaver of Los Angeles at 164 pounds. He won, 
48-47, 49-47, and lost, 49-48, on the judges cards' before the crowd of 1,146. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, the two boxers were often locked in each other's arms on the 
ropes. "He was holding me the whole time," said Armijo (8-0-1). "He wouldn't 
fight. He gave it his all in the first two rounds, then just tried to hang on 
after that." 
</P>
<P>
Weaver (7-2) complained often to the referee about being held and hit in the 
back of the head, but no points were taken from Armijo. After the boxers fell 
in the third round, Armijo (8-0-1) appeared to sit on Weaver's head. 
</P>
<P>
"His punching power was below zero," Weaver said. "He never hit me. When he 
started to rough-house me I started to slow down . . . They gave him the 
decision because he is the home-town favorite." 
</P>
<P>
In the main event, Los Angeles' Javier Moreno, 146 pounds, won a 10-round 
decision over Hedgemon Robertson, 96-94, 96-94, and, 99-91, at 146 pounds. 
Moreno is 13-7 with five knockouts. Robertson, 147 pounds, fell to 21-8-1 with 
18 knockouts.

FDA TAKES BLAME FOR DELAY IN PULLING FAULTY HEART VALVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration conceded Monday that the 
agency acted too slowly in moving against potentially deadly artificial heart 
valves manufactured by Irvine-based Shiley Inc. in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"As you look back over this, our track record doesn't look real good," James S. 
Benson, acting FDA commissioner, said at a daylong hearing conducted by the 
investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing focused on the FDA's oversight of Shiley, the heart-valve maker 
that is owned by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. Shiley employs 1,100 at its 
Orange County plant. 
</P>
<P>
Panel members are exploring ways to get faster agency action against problem 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Since the first of two Shiley valves that are at the center of the controversy 
went on the market in 1979, the company has reported a total of 389 failures 
resulting in 272 deaths. About 85,700 of the two valve models were produced. 
They were designed to replace diseased or damaged heart tissue that regulate 
the flow of blood through the organ. 
</P>
<P>
One model was withdrawn by the company in 1986 after the FDA began moving to 
suspend its sale. The other was sold only overseas between 1980-83. 
</P>
<P>
FDA officials said the slow pace of the agency's enforcement was partially due 
to the time it took to develop regulations to evaluate new heart valves -- 
which came under FDA oversight in 1976 -- and to Shiley's stubborn resistance 
to the agency's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Shiley officials, however, insisted that they have fully cooperated with the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
"Shiley diligently sought to eliminate the (failure) problem through a variety 
of actions," said Dr. Roger Sachs, Shiley vice president and medical director. 
Among other things, Shiley convened internal research committees and hired 
outside research firms to study the problem, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Shiley and government investigators agree that the precise cause of the 
failures, which occur in one of two "struts" that hold the artificial valve in 
place, was never determined. 
</P>
<P>
The congressional investigation of the FDA's relationship with Shiley is the 
latest inquiry that has produced criticism of the agency. Its problems have 
included a scandal in the generic drugs division involving disclosures of 
bribery and mismanagement and continuing criticism of the FDA's performance in 
regulating food imports and other items. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, 
has been one of the agency's most vocal critics. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony Monday, Daniel J. Chwirut of the FDA's Division of Mechanics 
accused Shiley of producing a heart valve of "marginal design" that was so 
sensitive to production imperfections that "you would have to have an almost 
perfect manufacturing operation in order to get the valve to function 
properly." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chwirut criticized Shiley's quality-control procedures and said 
the company appeared to willfully hamper the FDA's attempts to investigate the 
causes of the heart-valve failures. 
</P>
<P>
"They were definitely being less than fully honest with the agency in terms of 
submitting the data that we'd asked for," Chwirut said. "My impression was that 
they were not close to finding a solution to the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the FDA permitted Shiley to continue to market its "60-degree, 
convexo-concave" valve in the United States, Benson testified, because the 
agency mistakenly believed that the Shiley valve was less prone to producing 
dangerous blood clots than other artificial heart valves. 
</P>
<P>
"We believed that taking the . . . valve off the market might have deprived 
surgeons and patients of the better product," Benson said in written testimony 
presented to the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
By early 1986, the agency changed its mind, concluding from new statistical 
analyses that the valve offered no advantages with blood clots and that its 
mechanical failure rate was greater than other heart valves. The company 
voluntarily withdrew the 60-degree valve later that year. 
</P>
<P>
Benson said the FDA should have been more aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
That view was shared by Frederick Barbee of Minong, Wis., who testified that 
his wife Carol might have lived had Shiley informed him that the valve 
implanted in his wife's heart was prone to failure. Shiley has said its policy 
was to notify doctors of potential problems, but not patients. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the thing that is of greatest concern is profit," Barbee 
testified.

DUAL JOBS ARE GROWING TREND AS HOME COSTS TAKE BIGGER BITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A little-noted report suggests that more Americans are working at two jobs now 
than at any time in decades, perhaps since the 1940s, when there was a 
war-induced labor shortage. 
</P>
<P>
The report, from the Labor Department, shows dual jobs to be a growing trend. 
In 1980, 4.9 % of employed people held two jobs. The percentage rose to 5.4 in 
1985. And in 1989, it continued on to 6.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously over the past decade, there has been a tendency of women to put 
in more hours at "official" rather than family jobs and for older workers to 
supplement pensions by working at retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Marriages are occurring later than before, and there is a similar tendency to 
postpone children until later in life. And to afford a home under present 
conditions often requires the bounty of two incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in many areas of the country the financing and upkeep of the home take a 
larger percentage of household income than they used to, up to 50% in certain 
instances, or double what used to be considered affordable. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Is this really the good life that was promised? Is this progress? 
</P>
<P>
In spite of so-called affluence, for example, debt is increasing. And that same 
Labor Department survey shows that 44% of those working an extra job are doing 
so to meet household expenses and to pay debts. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this: While more women than ever are working, well over 50% of them, 
they earn less than men and advance more slowly. And surveys show they still 
haven't shed most of their household chores. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about progress arise in other areas too. The national debt is greater 
than ever. Productivity increases have slowed. For the first time since the 
Great Depression of the 1930s, the percentage of homeowners is shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
Success in the fight against poverty has slowed. Herbert Hoover in 1928 said 
the country was "nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in 
the history of any land." Today, one in seven live in "poverty." 
</P>
<P>
Progress? Consider these facts, taken from a study by the U.S. Census Bureau 
and the Conference Board, a private, not-for-profit educational and research 
group: 
</P>
<P>
Since 1900, life expectancy has risen from under 50 years to more than 75. 
Infant mortality has fallen from 99 per 1,000 births in 1915 to about 11 today. 
Average weekly hours in manufacturing declined to 40.5 hours in 1985 from 49.4 
hours in 1915, while real hourly wages rose from $2.44 to $9.53. 
</P>
<P>
Comparable net worth figures weren't available for earlier years of the 
century, but in 1950 per capita net assets were $27,021, half those of 1985. 
And the relative costs of food, clothing and shelter have declined steadily. 
</P>
<P>
More houses have indoor plumbing and central heating systems. And each year 
those houses seem to have more baths, swimming pools, decks, family rooms, 
telephones, radios, TVs, electric toasters, computers and smoke alarms. 
</P>
<P>
Vacation time has risen. Leisure has become a big business, and activities that 
once were the exclusive preserve of the elite, such as golf, tennis, sailing 
and skiing, are growth industries. 
</P>
<P>
"More money, more leisure and the pursuit of fun and travel have enormously 
enriched the way we live," says the report. 
</P>
<P>

SCHOOL BUSES HEAD FOR U.S. FROM NATION THAT BROUGHT YOU THE YUGO; 
</P>
<P>
EAST BLOC: THE TERRIBLE REPUTATION OF THE YUGO HASN'T DETERRED A VAN NUYS 
COMPANY FROM ITS INTENTION TO DISTRIBUTE YUGOSLAV-BUILT BUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
First came the Yugo, the pint-size car built in Yugoslavia that has been called 
"the worst car in America." 
</P>
<P>
Now get ready for a bus from Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
A Van Nuys company, Transportation Alternatives, has entered a joint venture to 
distribute Yugoslav-built school buses in the United States. The joint venture, 
called TAM/USA, is a partnership between the transportation design firm, and 
Tovarna Avtomobilov, which says it is Yugoslavia's largest manufacturer of 
buses, trucks and engines. 
</P>
<P>
Tovarna, however, is not the same company that manufactures the trouble-ridden 
Yugo cars. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the creation of a premium, U.S.-certified, 40-foot-long school 
bus that will be sold in California and other Western states, according to a 
press release distributed by David L. Kimport, a San Francisco attorney who 
said he put the deal together. First delivery of the buses is expected in late 
1991, Kimport said. 
</P>
<P>
One challenge, will be overcoming the negative publicity about vehicles made in 
Yugoslavia because of the Yugo's poor reputation. But Kimport insists that the 
Yugoslav buses will meet all safety requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Ned Einstein, president of Transportation Alternatives, would not comment on 
the joint venture, saying only that plans are in the formative stages. 
</P>
<P>
Kimport said the joint venture is being financed with about $8 million in 
start-up capital from Transportation Alternatives, Tovarna and Yugoslav banks. 
The new bus -- if it hits the roads here as planned -- would be the first 
U.S.-made bus to shuttle children to classes in the United States, said Kimport 
and industry sources. 
</P>
<P>
The buses will be manufactured at an existing plant in Yugoslavia and will be 
competitive in price with American buses, which typically run about $100,000, 
Kimport said. He said he expects the joint venture to produce about 300 buses 
in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
He said the buses will contain design and safety features "never before 
available in U.S. school buses," such as anti-explosive fuel elements (to keep 
the fuel from blowing up), tubular-frame passenger bus chassis (other school 
buses are constructed on truck chassis, he said) and pneumatic air bag 
suspension, a luxury coach feature. 
</P>
<P>
Tovarna Avtomobilov produces $350 million worth of vehicles and engines a year, 
Kimport said. 
</P>
<P>
Jack deKruis, chairman of Wayne Corp., a Richmond, Ind., bus manufacturer, said 
he is skeptical of TAM/USA's ability to meet rigid safety standards and other 
specifications imposed on bus manufacturers in the United States. But if the 
new company does meet the standards, deKruis said, "they can compete with us. 
It doesn't worry me." 
</P>
<P>
Karen Finkel, executive director of the Springfield, Va.-based National School 
Transportation Assn., a trade group, said, "I think they'll have some trouble 
breaking into the market." About 30,000 school buses are sold each year in the 
United States, Finkel said, and that market is dominated by five domestic 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
But Kimport said there is room for new companies in the bus business, 
particularly because many states are talking about requiring school buses to be 
replaced after they are 10 years old.

CARL ST. CLAIR IS NAMED TO LEAD PACIFIC SYMPHONY; 
</P>
<P>
ORCHESTRA: 37-YEAR-OLD WHO WON RAVE REVIEWS DURING AN AUDITION EARLIER THIS 
YEAR WILL ASSUME HIS DUTIES IN OCTOBER. HIS APPOINTMENT ENDS A TWO-YEAR SEARCH.

<TEXT>
<P>
Carl St. Clair, an assistant conductor of the Boston Symphony, Monday was named 
music director of the Pacific Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair -- at 37, the youngest of eight announced candidates for the position 
-- will assume his duties Oct. 1 and expects to spend about three months of 
next year in Orange County. He said Monday that although he will leave Boston, 
he will hold onto one of two other jobs he currently holds elsewhere around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of a three-year contract with the Pacific, St. Clair is to 
oversee the orchestra's artistic development and planning and to conduct six 
pairs of classical concerts each season at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center in Costa Mesa and two concerts each summer season at the Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre. In addition, he is to oversee school and community outreach 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair and orchestra officials would not disclose his salary. 
</P>
<P>
His appointment ends a search that began in February, 1988, with the 
resignation of founding music director Keith Clark after a bitter power 
struggle with the orchestra's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The search made headlines early this month when previous front-runner Lawrence 
Foster said the Pacific had offered him the job in December but withdrew the 
offer after talks broke down over salary, rehearsal demands and residency 
requirements. The orchestra management has refused to comment on Foster's 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair is also music director of the Ann Arbor (Mich.) Symphony and the 
Cayuga Chamber Orchestra of Ithaca, N.Y. He said Monday that he will maintain 
one of these posts in addition to his job with the Pacific, but has not yet 
decided which post he will give up. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he will maintain a residency in Orange County but that it will 
not be his exclusive address. However, he said, "I intend to spend as much time 
here as needed and as much time as I can." 
</P>
<P>
Pressed further, he said he expects to spend about three months in Orange 
County next year -- eight weeks for concerts plus "one month for administrative 
types of things." 
</P>
<P>
Musically, St. Clair said he intends "to work on the ensemble of the orchestra 
. . . its ability to perform as a cohesive unit, and its tone. We will begin to 
address that immediately with our first rehearsal." Critics generally praise 
the Pacific's musicians on an individual basis but find fault in the overall 
ensemble, asserting that the orchestra lacks refinement and a unified 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of programming, St. Clair said he will "start out in a more 
traditional fashion" but eventually will include contemporary music. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair was born in southwestern Texas, studied conducting with Walter 
Ducloux at the University of Texas at Austin and taught music for 10 years at 
Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville and for eight years at the 
University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
He became a conducting fellow at Tanglewood, Mass., the summer home of the 
Boston Symphony, in 1985, and the following January he became one of two 
assistants to the Boston Symphony. (The other is Pascal Verrot.) 
</P>
<P>
This past summer he toured with Leonard Bernstein and conducted various 
orchestras in East Berlin, Leningrad, Milan, Paris and Rome, among other 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
He conducted the Pacific Symphony in a pair of concerts Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, the 
week after his father died. Los Angeles Times critic Timothy Mangan praised St. 
Clair for his "malleable phrasing and clear textures" in Mahler's 
"Ruckert-Lieder," his "gentlemanly neatness" in Mozart's "Exsultate, jubilate," 
and his "moment by moment emotionalism" without loss of "musical argument" in 
Tchaikovsky's "Pathetique" Symphony. The Orange County Register said St. Clair 
brought "a potent combination of control and chaos to the podium" and the 
orchestra had "rarely shown the precision, finesse and genuine ensemble feeling 
it showed throughout the program." 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific was founded in 1979 by Clark, who worked tirelessly -- some said 
relentlessly -- to build it from a 30-member organization with an $8,000 budget 
to a full-size one with a budget of $3.1 million. Along the way, however, Clark 
also built a reputation as an abrasive, autocratic administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, the orchestra has had four executive directors, one of whom 
resigned after only six weeks. Current executive director Louis G. Spisto was 
brought on in June, 1987, as an administrative equal to Clark rather than as 
his subordinate, as his predecessors had been. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Pacific's move to the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 
where Clark played on the same stage as such internationally recognized 
conductors as Georg Solti and Riccardo Muti, increased critical scrutiny of 
Clark's musical abilities. 
</P>
<P>
Tension between Clark and board members reached the breaking point in February, 
1988, when the board voted 12 to 11 to not review his contract to conduct; 
Clark resigned as of the end of the 1988-89 season. Since then, the orchestra 
has been auditioning possible successors. 
</P>
<P>
Kazimierz Kord, music director of the Warsaw Philharmonic, has been the 
Pacific's music adviser and principal guest conductor during the search. Spisto 
said Monday that Kord is expected to return as a guest conductor in future 
seasons, but Kord's schedule precludes his being a guest in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Carl St. Clair will not actually conduct the Pacific Symphony again until the 
fall, when he assumes its directorship. He will lead the orchestra Oct. 9 in 
the opening concert of its 1990-91 season. The program will be announced. The 
orchestra's next concerts will be March 28 and 29 at 8 p.m. at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, where Richard Buckley, former 
music director of the Oakland Symphony, will conduct Haydn's Sinfonia 
Concertante and Mahler's Symphony No. 5.

THIS BAND'S MISSION IS A PLACE, NOT A CRUSADE, SAY MUSICIANS;

The innocence part of the band the Innocence Mission is pretty easy to figure. 
</P>
<P>
The young quartet of clean-cut friends who went to Catholic high school 
together in semi-rural Lancaster, Pa., certainly looks innocent, and the tone 
of the band's songs is one of poetic simplicity. Singer-songwriter Karen Peris 
even makes her own plain, Amish-inspired clothing. 
</P>
<P>
But what's the group's mission? 
</P>
<P>
"The mission in the name is a place to us, as opposed to a crusade," said 
Peris, 26, sitting with her husband, guitarist Don Peris, at A&amp;M Records' 
Hollywood offices recently. The group was preparing to launch its first 
national tour, which includes a stop tonight at Bogart's in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The name is just something I thought of one day and we liked it," Karen 
continued. "It made me think of the giant houses in children's books where you 
might find a refuge." 
</P>
<P>
It's an uncommon attitude for a band with an uncommon sound. The Innocence 
Mission's recent debut album has drawn comparisons to the haunting, dreamy 
styles of Kate Bush, the Cocteau Twins and Joni Mitchell (whose husband, Larry 
Klein, produced the record). 
</P>
<P>
At the center are Karen's ethereal vocals and keyboards, with support from 
Don's guitar and loping rhythms from bassist Mike Bitts and drummer Steve 
Brown. But most noteworthy are her vivid lyrics, with imagery and emotions that 
conjure the spirit of Emily Dickinson. 
</P>
<P>
"I have all her records!" joked Don, 25, when Dickinson's name was mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
But Karen said, "I haven't read much poetry, except for Rilke, a German poet 
and writer -- really simple, beautiful language. But that was only recently." 
</P>
<P>
And while many reviewers have suggested that her songs reflect the aura of 
their hometown, population 54,000 and in the heart of Amish country, Karen is 
less certain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say how the environment affected us," she said. "I've never 
written about the area or the people. But I'm sure we've been affected by 
seeing our parents act out their faith. Catholics are not often very vocal 
about their faith, but I learned it through their actions, the way they treated 
people and did things." 
</P>
<P>
For all that, the group's history is your basic saga of an American band. 
</P>
<P>
"I met Karen and the other guys in high school and put the band together after 
we graduated," Don said. "We played in Steve's garage while we went to college 
until '86, when we started putting most of our energy into the band. We were 
always making demo tapes at a local studio and wanted to start to see what 
could happen, and through the help of an attorney in New York we got a tape 
around to people, one of whom was with A&amp;M." 
</P>
<P>
Continued Karen: "We'd been playing live shows three or four months before 
that, and then for a few months record company scouts would come hear us in 
Philadelphia, where we played most. We had a nice following but weren't a big 
thing there like the Hooters or Tommy Conwell." 
</P>
<P>
From there it was a fairly standard series of events: signing a record 
contract, coming to Los Angeles to record, getting a fair amount of college and 
alternative radio airplay and some video airings on VH-1 and MTV's 
"alternative" showcase "120 Minutes," all complementing the generally positive 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
But, needless to say, this is not a band that slots nicely into the fast-paced 
rock 'n' roll world. 
</P>
<P>
"I think about it sometimes," said Karen, taking a long pause to contemplate 
how the forces of show biz might play on them. "Things are definitely getting 
busier, and at times it's hard to take. But for the most part we try to be what 
we always have been." 
</P>
<P>
 The Innocence Mission and Peter Himmelman play tonight at 8:30 at Bogart's in 
the Marina Pacifica Mall, 6272 E. Pacific Coast Highway, Long Beach.

THE ROAD BACK BEGINS IN MEMPHIS; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: MICHAEL CHANG PLAYS COMPETITIVELY FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HIS DEC. 6 
INJURY, BUT THE REAL TEST IS HIS FIRST SINGLES MATCH TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Robert Kerlan, sports physician to the stars, had seen just about every sprain, 
strain, bruise, break and tear an athlete could bring him. 
</P>
<P>
Then he saw Michael Chang's left hip. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, the youngest American male to win the French Open, set another 
precedent. 
</P>
<P>
Kerlan describes the injury as "almost singular in what I or anyone else have 
come to expect in a professional athlete. Anything but typical. I've seen 
something like it before in non-athletes -- after automobile accidents." 
</P>
<P>
While chasing a tennis ball during a Dec. 6 practice, Chang cracked the upper 
edge of the socket that holds the left hip joint together. His twisting motion 
pulled so strongly that the capsule of the joint split. 
</P>
<P>
It is an uncommon injury, Kerlan says, because the hips of most athletes can 
withstand such movement. But Chang was susceptible because of unusual bone 
structure, with the upper edge of the socket -- cartilage known as the growth 
plate -- failing to fuse with the bone. 
</P>
<P>
"Unique," Kerlan says, "in any athlete." 
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitative process also became unique. 
</P>
<P>
How does an athlete recover from an injury that athletes don't get? 
</P>
<P>
Kerlan prescribed rest and, later, exercises to strengthen the muscles around 
the hip. After two months, X-rays indicated enough healing for Kerlan to allow 
Chang to resume running and hitting tennis balls. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks later, Chang is entered in the Volvo Tennis/Indoor tournament in 
Memphis, where he and Jimmy Arias lost their opening-round doubles match Monday 
to the Uruguayan team of Diego Perez and Marcelo Filippini, 6-3, 7-6 (7-2). 
</P>
<P>
It was Chang's first tournament match since the injury, but the real test comes 
tonight when he opens singles play as the second-seeded player behind Stefan 
Edberg. It is Chang's first singles match since he came up limping. 
</P>
<P>
Is he coming back too soon? 
</P>
<P>
Chang says his hip still hurts a little. 
</P>
<P>
"Not in the bone or in the joints, but there's a little something," he says. 
"That's to be expected. My body is recovering from a whole trauma." 
</P>
<P>
Kerlan doesn't react calmly when this is relayed by a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
"No, it's not normal (to still hurt)," he says sharply. "That was one of the 
things he was advised about. You don't want him going back out there if he 
still hurts. Obviously, that would be a little silly. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can never be sure they're going to do exactly what you ask them to do. 
With all the pressure on them . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The thinking was that he and I understood what I was talking about. You have 
to proceed step by step, but you also have to use your head while doing it." 
</P>
<P>
No one on the Chang team can say it's too early. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible," says Joe Chang, Michael's father and coach. "Until you try, 
you don't know. There are a lot of ifs with an injury like this. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know. I'm not a doctor. I have to play it by ear." 
</P>
<P>
"I have to listen to my body," Michael Chang says. "If I feel anything, I'll 
have to stop and back off." 
</P>
<P>
According to Kerlan, the healing process continues. 
</P>
<P>
"By some amount, from a microscopic point of view, it will go on for several 
more weeks," he says. "But it's not critical. To a point, it should hold 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is no guarantee on these things. If he puts the same force on that 
area, and there's no reason to believe it's stronger than it was before, it 
could happen again. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can break your leg twice and break your arm twice, it's possible to 
fracture your hip twice." 
</P>
<P>
Chang has been warned about the dangers of coming back too quickly by someone 
who knows. 
</P>
<P>
Before recently hiring Jerry Solomon as his agent, Chang was represented by 
Jeff Austin, brother of Tracy Austin, who was perhaps the most striking tennis 
injury case of the 1980s. Champion of the U.S. Open in 1979 and 1982, back and 
neck injuries had knocked her all but out of tennis by late 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was with Jeff, he'd talk about how Tracy tried to come back too early 
and how your body overcompensates," Chang says. "You need to take the time to 
be 100% healed and ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Memphis tournament holds a special allure for Chang. Two years ago, 
he made his professional debut there. He likes the small-town atmosphere and 
the intimacy of the tournament, held indoors at the Racquet Club of Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
He also is guaranteed a six-figure appearance fee. 
</P>
<P>
It is Joe Chang's view that Michael has to begin his comeback somewhere, 
sometime -- and Memphis seems as good a place at as good a time as any. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't play Memphis, then we're probably not ready to play Newsweek (at 
Indian Wells next week) or Lipton (starting March 16 at Key Biscayne, Fla.)," 
Joe says. 
</P>
<P>
And Michael Chang wants to play in both. Indian Wells is less than a two-hour 
drive from his Placentia home. The Key Biscayne tournament is a big-money, 
high-prestige event played amid a Grand Slam atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we're going to play into it," Joe Chang says. "We want to build 
kind of gradually. We'll see how it goes." 
</P>
<P>
Chang was granted a first-round bye in Memphis and returns to singles 
competition tonight against Glenn Layendecker. He used the break in the 
schedule to team with Arias -- no stranger to the comeback trail himself -- for 
the brief doubles tuneup Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The doubles match served a purpose. "It was good to play to take away some of 
the nerves going into (the singles)," Chang says. 
</P>
<P>
He admitted to "feeling a bit sluggish" but with just three weeks of practice, 
he figures that will be the norm for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"They say it takes the same amount of time you've been out to get back to where 
you were before the injury," Chang says. "If that's correct, it's going to take 
me nine weeks to get back to form. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little bit rusty, but I've put on some upper-body weight and I'm serving 
a little bit better. My volleys are a lot better. When my feet come back, 
everything else is going to come into play." 
</P>
<P>
That is a pretty big when. Small and slender and only 18 years old, Chang wins 
because Chang runs. Built so low to the ground, he relies on leg strength for 
the power he packs behind his ground strokes. 
</P>
<P>
And leg strength is connected to the hip bone. 
</P>
<P>
For better or for worse, the singles comeback begins tonight. Chang insists he 
will proceed with caution. He claims he won't push too hard. 
</P>
<P>
He says he will listen to his body. And hope not to hear another crack.

OUTLOOK NOT GOOD FOR TALKS 
</P>

<P>
Baseball's collective bargaining talks recessed indefinitely Monday, with 
Commissioner Fay Vincent saying he viewed the impasse as a tragedy in which 
saving face has become an issue for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
On Day 12 of the owners' lockout of spring training camps, Vincent said that 
the April 2 start of the regular season was in "very heavy jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
"Disappointed is hardly the word," he said when asked about the prolonged 
inability to reach an agreement. "I think it's tragic, and I think that the 
ordinary fan doesn't care about issues. 
</P>
<P>
"All the fan cares about is the appearance, and the appearance is that of two 
giants (management and players) overwhelmed with riches, fighting in a 
circumstance where there is a national obligation or trust at stake. I think 
it's tragic to the point of absurdity." 
</P>
<P>
An active participant in the stalled talks, Vincent took on the role of 
mediator Sunday and Monday, attempting in vain to find a compromise to the 
pivotal issue of eligibility for arbitration during a series of phone 
conversations with Don Fehr, executive director of the Major League Players 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The only meeting Monday was a brief "courtesy call" on the commissioner's 
office by Fehr before he left for Phoenix, where he is scheduled to meet today 
with his executive board. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr said he probably will then meet with players in two or three other cities 
before returning to the negotiations in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Charles O'Connor, general counsel of the owners' Player Relations Committee, 
said that considering the stalemate over the arbitration question, "It's 
probably appropriate to separate for a while." 
</P>
<P>
How long? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it depends on what happens tomorrow," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
"Don told us we would hear from him after the meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Fehr, before leaving, said there had been no breakthrough on the arbitration 
question and no new proposals relating to pensions, minimum salary or roster 
size. Alluding to the fact that there were no negotiations Sunday and Monday, 
Fehr said he wasn't unwilling to negotiate, but that it would take an 
indication from the clubs that they have something "new and substantive to talk 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent thought he had. He said that recent suggestions by the union that the 
PRC take a look at the contributions of players with more than two years but 
fewer than three of major league service might provide the basis of compromise, 
a system in which two-plus players who met certain service and performance 
standards qualified for arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
In light of the owners' insistence that the eligibility standard remain at 
three years, Vincent's proposal seemed a significant step toward a compromise. 
But he said Fehr showed no willingness to compromise, that he remained firm in 
contending the requirement be rolled back to two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Fay was acting on behalf of the fans," O'Connor said. "He made a sincere 
effort to elicit a proposal, but was whistling in the dark. The simple fact is 
that we can't negotiate with ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor added that in a letter given to Fehr Monday, he made the point that if 
an agreement had been reached on salary arbitration, the PRC would have been 
willing to increase pension contribution and minimum salary. O'Connor left the 
door open to such a trade-off. 
</P>
<P>
Is the ball now in the players' court? Is it their responsibility to respond? 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said he hoped they felt that responsibility, much as he felt a sense of 
urgency to keep working at solutions even though, "I don't know what I'm doing 
in a constitutional sense (of the office). 
</P>
<P>
"I think most people, including the players, want to see the game back on the 
field, but the issue of face is involved here, too," he said, referring to one 
side giving up a year or the other giving up on the idea of getting a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The economics involved in that year pale compared to the economics of the 
season being postponed even a month, so it's pretty clear it can't be 
economics, it has to be something more, and that gets to the issues of morality 
and emotions, which makes the whole process more difficult," Vincent said. "I 
mean, the question of winning or losing in negotiations is an absurdity." 
</P>
<P>
And he added that to some degree both sides have already lost in that "all this 
silliness does not enhance our position as a well-run, sophisticated, sensitive 
enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
Which is not to say there hasn't been a variety of agreements. Among the most 
important: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Collusion protection guaranteeing, among other things, that the owners will 
pay treble damages if guilty again in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A concession by the owners that the right to re-open negotiations in what 
will be a four-year agreement should come after three years rather than the two 
they initially proposed. 
</P>
<P>
"We've solved a number of issues, but we all knew the arbitration problem would 
be the most difficult," Vincent said. "Eventually, you can't solve it and run 
out of time -- and that's where we are." 
</P>
<P>
Where they seem to be is in the midst of a long lockout. Would Vincent 
reconsider and order their camps opened? 
</P>
<P>
He didn't answer directly, saying only that an agreement was needed and that he 
would be weighing ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Even one that would cost the owners face?

PLAYERS QUESTION STRATEGY; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: SOME SAY UNION DEMAND FOR REDUCED ARBITRATION ELIGIBILITY ISN'T WORTH 
DELAYING SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Although Don Fehr continued to call salary arbitration the key issue of 
baseball's labor dispute, several Dodgers joined a growing list of players 
Monday who apparently disagree with their union chief. 
</P>
<P>
The players' fight to have arbitration eligibility reduced from three years' 
service to two is not worth delaying the start of the season, according to some 
Dodgers. They say they are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could reach an agreement by leaving it at three years, I expect that's 
what I would do," said relief pitcher Tim Crews, who is working out with 
several major leaguers in the Orlando, Fla., area. "I've told this to Tim 
Belcher (the Dodgers' interim player representative, who was en route to 
Phoenix), and I've talked to quite a few players who all say the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"We all agree that three years for arbitration is not a bad thing." 
</P>
<P>
Crews thinks Fehr will be apprised of that in today's meeting with the Major 
League Players Assn.'s executive council in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he will walk in that room and everybody will say that we should leave 
the arbitration at three years and this contract could be done in a couple of 
days," Crews said. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Dempsey said he thought that arbitration wasn't even supposed to be a 
major issue in the negotiations, which has resulted in a spring training 
lockout that had reached 12 days Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember a couple of informal polls of the players, and arbitration was 
always the last consideration in line," Dempsey said. "That's why I can't 
believe it is even a major issue here. Maybe that's what some people are 
saying, but maybe something else is happening, like we're fighting to get a 
25th player, or fighting for pension benefits and licensing money. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, if arbitration is what is keeping us locked out, we can sacrifice that." 
</P>
<P>
Some Pittsburgh Pirates also said that arbitration eligibility was not worth a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's going to be awful tough for the owners to give back that year, so 
if it's the only thing holding this back, why not go ahead and agree?" pitcher 
Bob Kipper told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. "Who's complaining? Probably the 
first- and second-year players. But I didn't complain after two years." 
</P>
<P>
Added Pirate shortstop Jay Bell: "If that's the only holdup, I don't think it's 
that big of a deal. We've gone four years with it at three years, and it's 
worked out well." 
</P>
<P>
Said George Brett of the Kansas City Royals: "Personally, I feel three years is 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
However, Angel catcher Lance Parrish, one of nearly a dozen players from 
Southern California who are working out daily at El Dorado High in Placentia, 
said willingness to leave arbitration eligibility at three years is 
short-sighted and will cost all players in the end. 
</P>
<P>
"Players who have said we should give in on arbitration should really have a 
good look at the situation. They're speaking out of line," Parrish said. "This 
is an important issue and something we're going to hang on to. We gave up that 
year (of eligibility) in '85 in order to get the negotiations going and now the 
owners are playing games and they weren't willing to discuss it until the 12th 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts emotionally to not be in spring training, especially because I think 
this is all unnecessary. As intelligent as the owners are, they should realize 
the game is going well and just leave it at that." 
</P>
<P>
Fehr, who said he will meet with several other groups of players before 
returning to the negotiations in New York, said he was unaware of player 
disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
"I have yet to have a player call and say we should be doing anything 
different," Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Charles O'Connor, negotiator for the owners: "I heard the quotes, but I 
didn't hear the players say them directly. Now, if that's what they all say in 
Phoenix, that's different." 
</P>
<P>
One Dodger said such a change is possible. Pat Perry, vocal in his support of 
the two-year arbitration plan because of how the system affected former St. 
Louis Cardinal teammates, nonetheless said it could disappear as a main issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I think arbitration is definitely worth the fight -- I've seen how owners used 
the current system to keep guys like Vince Coleman and Joe Magrane in the minor 
leagues a little longer to cost them a year's service and save the club money," 
Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
"But if it is presented to us as a main issue, we may take a new position. If 
it will put the season in jeopardy, we'll have to step back and take a look." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Padre pitcher Greg Harris would be ineligible for arbitration until 
after the 1991 season under the current basic agreement. But if arbitration 
eligibility is reduced, Harris stands to earn considerably more than the 
average salary of $219,114 for players who have between two and three years of 
service time. 
</P>
<P>
"I know this affects my life and livelihood, and I'd be lying if I said this 
wouldn't really benefit me, but I'm really not that concerned with that right 
now," said Harris, who earned $71,500 last season and is expected to earn less 
than $200,000 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe that's not very smart on my part, but I don't see dollar signs that 
much. It's not something I'm really thinking about. If you do the job on the 
field, one year isn't going to hurt that much." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gwynn disagreed. "Hey, I'm just like everyone else, I want to get to 
spring training and play," Gwynn said. "In fact, I've already got my bags 
packed. But I'm not ready not ready to play at the expense of what happened 
last time. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of guys who were screwed because of what happened then. It's 
not going to be like '85 when guys say, 'Hey, I got my seven years in, I don't 
care.' 
</P>
<P>
"We can't have anybody suffering again. The owners were crying poor, and we 
fell for it." 
</P>
<P>
Some Dodgers, however, believe the current plan is actually more rewarding than 
the old one. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a case of, you put in your dues and you will be fine," Jeff Hamilton 
said. "A lot of us have had to go that way." 
</P>
<P>
Said Crews: "With three years, you have a lot more statistics you can take to 
arbitration with you. It's easier to prove your case. And for your first three 
years, it makes you work harder." 
</P>
<P>
All Dodgers interviewed agreed, however, that they wanted to make sure 
everything else in the contract was acceptable before giving up the arbitration 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
"If everything else has been resolved, that makes a difference," pitcher Jay 
Howell said. "But is everything else resolved? I don't think we know that. I'm 
not so sure that arbitration is the only thing left. Maybe it is the most 
newsworthy item, the most understandable item. But is it the only one? 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the players still have a lot to find out."

PEERS SALUTE GENERAL OF ARNIE'S ARMY; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: PLAYERS ACKNOWLEDGE A DEBT TO PALMER FOR HELPING TO MAKE THEM WEALTHY AND 
FAMOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Whenever Senior PGA Tour players get together, the conversation eventually gets 
around to Arnold Palmer. Palmer's peers are in Arnie's Army. 
</P>
<P>
Chi Chi Rodriguez once said: "Every professional golfer should say a prayer 
every day and thank God for Arnold Palmer. He has made us all rich and famous." 
</P>
<P>
Only winning would have made Lee Trevino happier than when Palmer, reaching 
into the past, won the Senior Skins Game last month in Hawaii, picking up 
$240,000 -- $215,000 on one hole. 
</P>
<P>
Both the regular and senior tours owe their success, in large measure, to 
Palmer. A sponsor knows his tournament will be a success if Palmer decides to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
He is asked more frequently now about how much longer he will go on playing. 
His answer: as long as he enjoys it and feels competitive. 
</P>
<P>
A trimmer Palmer, rejuvenated by his skins victory, played in the first four 
senior events of the new season in Florida. Last week he captained the U.S. 
team that won the Chrysler Cup in Florida. He also finds time to build golf 
courses, a booming business. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer turned 60 last September and thus eligible for the super seniors, a 
tournament within a tournament on the senior tour. But he will not take on the 
real old-timers. He is still highly competitive on the main senior tour, save 
for his putting. He is No. 2 among the seniors in reaching greens in regulation 
but only 34th on the money list. Trevino, the top putter, is the runaway money 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer said that he feels better both physically and mentally than he did 10 
years ago. He won't say so, but it is, in part, because Jack Nicklaus turned 50 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
The Nicklaus-Palmer rivalry was one of the greatest in sports during the 1960s. 
Unless Nicklaus changes his mind about the senior tour, however, they won't 
meet all that much in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer beat Nicklaus in the senior skins. Their next meeting is expected to be 
at the Tradition at Scottsdale, Ariz., the first weekend in March. 
</P>
<P>
Some seniors are miffed at Nicklaus because he said most of those playing well 
on their tour had been marginal players on the regular tour. He also panned 
their use of shorter courses. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Crosby, tour media director, said that Dave Hill, after shooting a 68 in 
the first round at Key Biscayne, Fla., two weeks ago, walked into the media 
tent and said: "I had a 68, not bad for a marginal player. I'm disappointed in 
Nicklaus. I had a lot of respect for him. I think he owes us an apology." 
</P>
<P>
Hill won 12 tournaments on the regular tour and was in the top 50 for 17 
consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, however, said he understands how Nicklaus feels. He went through the 
same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nostalgic feeling when you reach 50," Palmer said. "You feel great and 
you think you shouldn't join the seniors because you can still win on the 
regular tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you realize they hit the ball farther, have more stamina and putt better, 
the senior tour starts looking better. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember saying before I reached 50 that I didn't expect to play with the 
old men. I thought it was a nice idea, but not for me. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) once I started playing with old rivals such as Gary Player, Miller 
Barber and Billy Casper, I found my competitive spirit just as keen as ever. I 
really enjoyed it. Jack will, too, eventually." 
</P>
<P>
Because of a knee problem, Palmer played in only 16 tournaments last season, 
his fewest since 1985. A rigorous conditioning program has prepared him for 
more tournaments this season. He runs four or five miles a day and works out on 
weights and a stationary bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
After a strenuous morning workout in January, he returned home breathing 
heavily and drenched in perspiration. His wife, Winnie, was aghast. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you think you're overdoing it?" she asked. "Are you sure you won't have 
a heart attack? Is all that work worthwhile?" 
</P>
<P>
Palmer wondered. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times when I asked myself if all the work I'd done getting myself 
in shape was worth it," he said. "But when I won the skins, I had my answer. It 
was definitely worth it. It was heartwarming to hear the fans cheering me." 
</P>
<P>
The love affair between golf fans and the King, as his fellow pros call him 
with affection, flared anew in Hawaii. It began shortly after Palmer became a 
professional in 1954 and has seldom wavered. 
</P>
<P>
When Palmer joined the tour, there was still a bit of a stigma attached to 
professionals. Golf purists thought it was a gentleman's game, to be played for 
a small wager but not for a living. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer's star quality changed that. In 1958, the first year he was the leading 
money winner, Palmer earned $42,608 on a 37-tournament tour worth barely $1 
million. Thirty years later, Curtis Strange won $1.1 million in a season. 
</P>
<P>
His peers say Palmer and his charisma, the ready smile and enthusiasm, were the 
major ingredients in raising interest and prize money. 
</P>
<P>
Arnie's Army, though, did not begin until 1960, when Palmer was winning his 
second Masters at Augusta, Ga. An Augusta sportswriter, John Hendrickson coined 
the phrase. In those days at the Masters, soldiers from nearby Fort Gordon 
manned scoreboards around the course and rooted for Palmer. They had signs on 
the boards that read, "Go Arnie!" 
</P>
<P>
The army grew and so did pro golf. It mushroomed during the rivalry of Palmer 
and the young Jack Nicklaus, and Nicklaus became almost as popular as Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
At the senior skins, it seemed that the tide had finally turned. Nicklaus had 
everyone's attention at a press conference before the first practice round. 
Palmer seemed uncomfortable at not being asked questions. Nicklaus practiced 
before big crowds. In the pro-am before the two-day event started, Nicklaus had 
a bigger gallery. 
</P>
<P>
But when skins play began, there was no doubt as to the fans' favorite. On the 
second day, when Nicklaus made a birdie to win a $140,000 skin, there were 
cheers. They were mild, though, compared to the cheers when Palmer had a chance 
to pick up $25,000 on the next hole. And when he won the big one, there was 
bedlam. 
</P>
<P>
The senior tour was being formed about the time Palmer became eligible. Don 
January, Sam Snead and Gardner Dickinson thought it would be a good idea to 
stage three or four tournaments a year so old-timers could get together, play a 
little golf and tell stories. 
</P>
<P>
There were two events in 1980. The next year, Palmer began to show up and 
interest started to soar. In less than a decade, it surpassed the LPGA. 
</P>
<P>
"Golf had been so good to me," Palmer said. "It was up to me to give something 
back. Besides, there were all my friendly rivals." 
</P>
<P>
In its 11th season, the senior tour has 42 events for a total purse of more 
than $17 million. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer last won a tournament in 1988. Winning depends on his putting. 
</P>
<P>
He has accumulated more than 1,000 putters and has used most of them, either in 
competition or practice. 
</P>
<P>
His struggle continues. "I have to do something about it or I can't compete," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter remarked that Palmer had never been an outstanding putter. 
</P>
<P>
"If you had been as good a putter, for instance, as Ben Crenshaw or Bob 
Charles, you probably would have won 30 more tournaments," the reporter 
ventured. 
</P>
<P>
"More than that," Palmer replied tersely. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino suggested that Palmer change his putting grip for the last day of the 
skins game, and Palmer later gave Trevino much of the credit for his success. 
</P>
<P>
The hot putting carried over the next week at Key Biscayne, Fla., where he 
opened the tournament with a 66. He faded a bit in the next round and admitted 
that he had started to lose confidence again in his putting. 
</P>
<P>
That has happened many times in Palmer's 36-year career as a pro, and he has 
always come back. But whether he does or not, you can bet that Arnie's Army 
will be there cheering.

<P>
TENNIS: KNEE INJURY CLOUDS FUTURE, PROVIDES EXCUSE WHEN COMEBACK STALLS AT 30 
YEARS OF AGE.

INDIAN WELLS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Her right knee encased in a blue brace that stretched from mid-thigh to 
mid-calf, Kathy Jordan searches for something from the past. 
</P>
<P>
At 30, after being sidelined two years because of injury, it's not easy. 
</P>
<P>
Once ranked No. 5 in the world and known as the principal tormentor of Chris 
Evert, Jordan no longer has a ranking. Her anterior cruciate ligament was torn 
in August of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Jordan has played only four matches, losing three. The latest was 
Monday when, as a wild-card entry, she lost to Isabelle Demongeot of France, 
6-3, 2-6, 6-0, in the first round of the Virginia Slims of Indian Wells at 
Hyatt Grand Champions. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan accepted the loss quietly, something she has been doing lately. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy making a comeback at 30 because then doubt sets in, like you . . 
. can't play tennis anymore," Jordan said. "Having an injury like mine puts 
doubts in your head about almost everything. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes it easy to accept things on the court, like 'Oh, I lost that point 
because of my knee.' I have it in my brain -- 'My knee went out, my knee went 
out, my knee went out.' " 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's knee went out and rearranged her career. She has won more than $1.3 
million in an 11-year career most notable for her doubles triumphs with Anne 
Smith and Liz Smylie, and also for an uncanny ability to upset Evert, whom she 
defeated three times in important events. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest was in the third round at Wimbledon in 1983, when Jordan, at 23, 
defeated Evert in straight sets. It was the first time Evert failed to reach at 
least the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam event. 
</P>
<P>
But Jordan soon began to have trouble with her knee. She had two partial tears 
of the anterior cruciate ligament, the main stabilizing ligament in the knee, 
before suffering a complete tear while playing in the Virginia Slims of New 
England. 
</P>
<P>
"I basically had to accept that my career was over," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan stayed on a rehabilitation program for a year before trying to get back 
on the court. She played just once last year, but decided to give her career 
one more chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm giving myself this year to see how it goes," Jordan said. "Only time will 
tell if I can still do it. 
</P>
<P>
"At least I can say I have had certain matches when I did do it. Some people 
will never be able to say that, so I have to be proud." 
</P>
<P>
Against Demongeot, Jordan seemed slow, partly because her brace limited her 
lateral movement. Jordan said her doctors have said she can discard the brace, 
but she wears it for psychological reasons. 
</P>
<P>
She can come back, Jordan said. Maybe not all the way back to No. 5, but 
possibly far enough to earn a place in the Wimbledon draw. For that reason, she 
continues to play, at least sometimes against herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm just so slow, so I am slow," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
The Angelica Gavaldon bandwagon rolled onto the court Monday with the star of 
the show wearing large, silver hoop earrings and dressed in an ensemble of 
shocking pink. 
</P>
<P>
If the 16-year-old from Coronado looked sharp, she played even sharper in her 
first-round match against Shaun Stafford. Gavaldon won, 6-0, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon, who reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open as an amateur, 
turned pro last week and reached the semifinals of the Virginia Slims of 
Oklahoma.

TENNIS: ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, SAMPRAS IS GLAD HE PICKED UP HIS FIRST 
TOURNAMENT VICTORY IN PHILADELPHIA.

PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, Pete Sampras, at 16 virtually unknown and altogether unranked, 
did the unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
He asked Marilyn Fernberger, tournament director of the Ebel U. S. Pro Indoor 
in Philadelphia, for a wild-card berth into the qualifying event, even though 
he had never played a professional tournament in his life. 
</P>
<P>
Fernberger, surprisingly, granted Sampras' request and the young man from 
Rancho Palos Verdes went on to win three qualifying matches before losing in 
the first round of the main draw to tour veteran Sammy Giammalva. The 
performance was good enough to allow Sampras his first computer-ranking points. 
</P>
<P>
It seems only fitting, therefore, that Sampras returned to Philadelphia for 
another milestone, his first professional title, which he won in convincing 
style Sunday, beating seventh-seeded Andres Gomez of Ecuador, 7-6, 7-5, 6-2. 
Along the way, the 13th-seeded Sampras dispatched No. 3 Andre Agassi, who was 
forced to retire at one set all in their third round-match because of food 
poisoning, No. 5 Tim Mayotte and unseeded qualifier Mark Kratzmann in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very glad that my first tournament victory came here in Philadelphia," 
said Sampras, who moved from No. 32 to a career-high No. 17 in the computer 
rankings. "It's really very special." 
</P>
<P>
If Sampras felt special, he certainly didn't show it. He appeared neither 
nervous before the final nor exuberant afterward. 
</P>
<P>
His attitude, in fact, seems in direct contrast to that of his fellow teen 
superstars, Andre Agassi and Michael Chang, both of whom have been known to 
play to the crowds. Even after he was chased down by some giggly girls who 
presented him with roses and a kiss after his quarterfinal win, Sampras took it 
all in stride, saying, "I'm not worried about girls screaming at me. I'm just 
out there to win." 
</P>
<P>
Sampras differs from Agassi and Chang in another way, and this could prove far 
more important to his development. At 6 feet and 160 pounds, Sampras is a 
natural serve-and-volley player, although he is also not reluctant to stay on 
the baseline and hit scorching backhand passing shots. But his serve is his big 
weapon. He served nine aces in the final Sunday, the first he had ever played 
in. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a complete player," said Gomez, who was playing in his 31st final. "I 
tried really hard to find his weaknesses, but I just couldn't. He can serve and 
volley or stay back, which I don't think Chang or Agassi will ever be able to 
do. I definitely think he's the best of those three guys." 
</P>
<P>
Sampras was not an aggressive player from the start, but at 14, when he 
realized that he probably would be tall, he gave up his two-handed backhand and 
started playing at the net. Within a year, he had become one of the best 
juniors in the country, reaching the final of the USTA national 18 tournament 
before losing to Chang. He avenged that loss at the U.S. Open junior tournament 
three weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
Early on in 1988, Sampras realized that he could compete with the top players 
in the world. One week after his debut in Philadelphia, he reached the third 
round in Indian Wells, defeating established pros Eliot Teltscher and Ramesh 
Krishan before losing to Emilio Sanchez, then ranked among the top 20 in the 
world. That day, he gave up any thought of going to college and turned pro. He 
was ranked No. 311 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of '88, Sampras had cracked the top 100, but one match, midway 
through last year, brought him to the attention of the tennis Establishment -- 
a 5-7, 6-3, 1-6, 6-1, 6-4 second-round upset of defending champion Mats 
Wilander at the U.S. Open. Even after that victory, Sampras refused to 
celebrate, preferring instead to march calmly into the fourth round, where he 
lost to American Jay Berger. 
</P>
<P>
It is not in Sampras' nature, he says, to either gush or whine. He traces his 
laid-back attitude to his parents, father Sam, a mechanical engineer for the 
Air Force who never played tennis, and mother Georgia, a Greek-born homemaker 
who "doesn't even know the rules of the game," according to her son. 
</P>
<P>
It is for that reason that Sampras never feels stressed out, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"If I lose, big deal; if I win, that's great too."

A Kentucky dentist allegedly killed thoroughbred racehorses so owners could 
collect insurance money, the FBI said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Joseph James Brown of Shelbyville, Ky., was arrested and charged with wire 
fraud Feb. 17 at Calder Race Course after an investigation by the FBI and the 
New York-based Thoroughbred Racing Protective Board. 
</P>
<P>
"Brown was arrested . . . by FBI agents as he was about to administer a lethal 
injection to a thoroughbred race horse," FBI spokesman Paul Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown allegedly said he would charge $15,000 to kill one horse -- $2,500 down 
and the rest upon settlement of the insurance claim, according to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
An associate claimed Brown had also killed horses in New York and New Jersey, 
the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
The horse-killing scheme had gone on for a few months, said Paul Berube, 
president of the racing board. He declined to provide additional details. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 43, was released on $5,000 bond after his arrest but later failed to 
contact Miami federal court to submit the name of his lawyer as required. He 
has been given until 5 p.m. today to do so, court officials said, but hasn't 
been declared a fugitive.

Brown is charged with making telephone calls across state lines in a scheme to 
defraud. The warrant for his arrest says the scheme involved "collecting on 
insurance policies by intentionally destroying thoroughbred racing horses via 
lethal injection." 
</P>
<P>
An undercover investigator with the racing board visited Brown at his horse 
farm near Shelbyville in December, according to an FBI affidavit. Brown told 
the agent he had killed a horse and insurance money was collected after the 
animal's death. 
</P>
<P>
Brown offered his services if the agent ever wanted a horse killed for 
insurance money, the document said. Last month, Brown referred the agent to a 
third party, identified as Bob West, in Lexington, Ky., to discuss the 
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
West and the agent met in Lexington, the FBI affidavit said. West told the 
agent of other horses he and Brown had killed in New York and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
The agent and West discussed the fee for the horse's death, which was to be 
based on the dollar amount of the insurance on the animal, according to the 
document. The agent later set the $15,000 fee with Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Brown and the agent arranged for the dentist to travel to Miami to kill a horse 
that the agent said had been insured for four years. The agent met Brown at 
Miami International Airport and the two traveled to the stables at Calder, 
according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
They were met there by FBI agents who arrested Brown before any horses were 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"During a search of Dr. Brown, two vials of a clear liquid and two syringes 
were concealed in his socks," the affidavit said.

THE PREPS: FAMILIAR STORY: MANUAL ARTS VS. CRENSHAW IN CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manual Arts High's Marcell Capers is familiar with Crenshaw's City Section 
dominance in boys' basketball. He played on the Cougars' junior varsity as a 
sophomore two seasons ago before transferring to Manual Arts. 
</P>
<P>
He admits that despite living only three blocks from Manual Arts, he was more a 
Crenshaw follower than a Toiler fan when he was in junior high school. So, when 
his parents decided to send him to Crenshaw to begin his sophomore year, he did 
not object. 
</P>
<P>
Capers transferred after one semester. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I wanted to go to Manual Arts all along," said Capers, a 6-foot-2 
guard who has caught the eye of many college scouts. "I wanted to go to 
Crenshaw because of their coaches and winning tradition, but I was just unhappy 
there. I just wanted to go to school closer to home." 
</P>
<P>
Now, two years later, Capers will be matched against his former school when 
Manual Arts (24-3) and Crenshaw (22-4) meet for the City 4-A Division title at 
8:30 p.m. Friday at the Sports Arena for the third consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what it's all about . . . playing for the City championship at the 
Sports Arena," said Capers, who is averaging 16 points and 11 assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw defeated the Toilers in the last two City title games, 83-67 in 1988 
and 84-72 last season. Manual Arts has not won a City title since 1981 when it 
defeated Crenshaw, 82-69. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the Toilers hope their depth will make a difference. In Manual 
Arts' 72-48 semifinal victory over Dorsey last Friday night, four Toilers 
scored in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we got caught up in the Crenshaw hype," said Capers, who scored 19 
points against Dorsey. "But this year, we are a lot deeper." 
</P>
<P>
Junior swingmen Dwain Bradberry and Kevin Beal average nearly 14 points per 
game for the Toilers. Against Dorsey, versatility on defense helped the Toilers 
shut down the Dons' high-scoring offense. 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts also has the outside shooting of Cedric Jones, a senior guard who 
specializes in shutting down opposing point guards; and the inside strength of 
William Celestine, a 6-5 senior center averaging 12 rebounds and five blocked 
shots a game. 
</P>
<P>
For the Toilers to win their third City title in the last 22 years, they will 
have to stop Crenshaw guards Kevin Ollie and Alexous Scruggs, who combined to 
score 50 points in the Cougars' semifinal overtime victory over Cleveland last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Ollie, a 6-2 junior who scored 33 points against Cleveland, is the emerging 
star for the defending State champion Cougars. After being a defensive backup 
for Terry Cannon, last season's City player of the year, Ollie has become the 
leader of the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
"Where last season Terry was smooth in getting the job done, Kevin has to 
really work at what he's doing," said Crenshaw Coach Willie West, who is going 
for his 12th City title. "But they both still get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
Ollie is not surprised with the success he has had despite his lack of previous 
varsity experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always had it in me to take control and create," Ollie said. "I have 
taken it all in stride in becoming the leader of the team. We have a lot of 
good players who play well together, and I just try to lead by example." 
</P>
<P>
Scruggs, a sophomore, is another underclassmen on whom Crenshaw relies. Against 
Cleveland, Scruggs scored 11 points in the second half, including two scoring 
drives late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a typical Crenshaw team," West said. "We did not have players 
returning with a lot of varsity experience from last season, and we don't have 
a big man in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
"But I am pleased with the team's development because they have come a long 
way. Especially when you look on the floor and the players leading you are a 
junior, who had to switch from being a defensive player to a point and scoring 
guard; and a 10th grader, who has had to step in and do a lot more than I had 
planned on him doing." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents agree with West. "They are not as talented as usual, but, they are 
just as big on heart and knowing how to win," Manual Arts Coach Randolph 
Simpson said. "The key for us is to slow down their guards, who are very 
aggressive offensively. Hopefully, our guards will be tougher on them 
defensively than what they are used to." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's game will be the seventh playoff meeting between Crenshaw and Manual 
Arts in the last five years. The Cougars have won five of the last six, with 
the Toilers' only win coming in the 1988 State semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A Division championship game, defending champion Fremont (29-2) will 
play North Hollywood (23-3) before the 4-A final at 6:30 p.m. at the Sports 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Fremont guard Lionel Pandy led a balanced scoring attack with 19 points in the 
Pathfinders' 72-53 rout over San Fernando in the semifinals. For the last two 
seasons, Fremont has dominated 3-A play. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to be honest, but I think that this is the best (3-A) team ever," 
Fremont Coach Sam Sullivan said. "We have played well the entire season and 
have won more games than any other team in Fremont's history. We are a game 
away from 30 wins and that is a goal that we had at the beginning of the 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Pandy, who is averaging 19 points and six assists per game, the 
Pathfinders have Chris Ford, who leads the team with a 19.5 scoring average; 
Michael Tate, who is averaging 13 points and 10 rebounds per game; and Robert 
Moore, who averages 10 points and five assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
The State tournament will offer a different challenge for the Washington girls' 
basketball team, which will play Van Nuys (22-3) in the City 4-A finals Friday 
at 4:30 p.m. in the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Washington (27-3) has not lost to a City team in almost two years. The Generals 
defeated Carson, 73-34, in the City 4-A semifinals with Detra Lockhart scoring 
22 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to playing in the State tournament," Lockhart said. 
"Teams we play in the City are either not aggressive enough or not talented 
enough. Van Nuys is a good team, but they are not a Morningside or a Lynwood." 
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
In the City girls' 3-A final, Marshall will play University at 2:30 p.m. Friday 
in the Sports Arena. . . . In the Southern Section boys' 5-A final, Loyola of 
Los Angeles will meet Santa Ana Mater Dei at 6:45 p.m. Saturday in the Sports 
Arena. Loyola last won the Southern Section Large Schools Division in 1953. . . 
. The National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame banquet honoring top area 
scholar-athletes is March 6 at the Casa Italia in Los Angeles. . . . Bell 
defeated Kennedy of Granada Hills, 1-0, to win the City 4-A soccer title last 
Saturday, after replacing Monroe, which was disqualified for using ineligible 
players last Friday. . . . In wrestling, Fremont's Ricardo Peralta won the City 
105-pound crown for the second consecutive year by defeating Oswaldo Ramirez of 
San Fernando. Pascual Moreno of Wilson won the 138-pound title.

NEWSWIRE: DAVIS TELLS SACRAMENTO TO NOT HOLD ITS BREATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sacramento's chances of bringing the Raiders to the state capital suffered a 
major setback Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Anne Rudin told reporters that Al Davis, Raider managing general partner, 
told her by phone that he is not going to reach a decision by the Wednesday 
deadline set by the Sacramento City Council. Davis will receive a 
city-financed, $50 million franchise fee if he announces a move to Sacramento 
by then. 
</P>
<P>
"He will probably not make a decision by Wednesday," Rudin said. "He wanted 
more time to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Rudin said she doubted there would be any attempt by City Council members to 
extend the deadline. "I don't think anybody's going to propose it," she said. 
"The votes aren't there."

CREW SAVED AFTER FINNISH BOAT CAPSIZES IN ROUND THE WORLD RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The 16-member crew of the Finnish entry Martela was rescued Monday after the 
81-foot sloop lost its keel and capsized 150 miles off the coast of South 
America on the fourth leg of the Whitbread Round the World Race. 
</P>
<P>
Martela, skippered by Markku Wiikeri, has been having trouble with its keel 
since the first leg of the race in September. 
</P>
<P>
The keel was refitted to the German Frers design in Montevideo, Uruguay, but 
the bolts worked loose again. 
</P>
<P>
The boat was in fourth place, 350 miles out from Punta del Este, Uruguay, when 
the keel let go shortly after noon. Conditions were moderate -- 15 knots of 
wind and three-foot seas -- but the sudden loss of ballast caused the boat to 
roll upside down. After broadcasting an emergency distress signal, some of the 
crew scrambled onto the bottom of the hull and others went into inflated rafts. 
</P>
<P>
The nearest boats, Merit and Charles Jourdan, altered course to pick up the 
crew about 4 1/2 hours later. Those two boats will receive credit for the time 
lost and for extra crew transported to Punta del Este. 
</P>
<P>
Steinlager 2 of New Zealand continued to lead the 23-boat fleet and was 
expected to reach Punta del Este late Monday. The 84-foot ketch won the first 
three legs and led another New Zealand entry, Fisher &amp; Paykel, by 70 
nautical miles as the 32,932-nautical mile race neared its two-thirds point.

BUSH'S EDUCATION EFFORT 'TEPID'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush is failing to back up his rhetoric about educational excellence 
with federal money, and the Administration's proposed 2% spending increase for 
schools is "meager" and "tepid," House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said today. 
</P>
<P>
"While I commend the President for his desire to be known as 'the education 
President,' I question whether he can achieve that goal by proposing a meager 
2% increase in the federal spending on education," Foley told the nation's 
governors. 
</P>
<P>
"The simple fact is we don't have a 2% education problem in this country," he 
said. "The education gap is much more daunting." 
</P>
<P>
Foley spoke to the bipartisan National Governors' Assn. as it concluded its 
annual winter meeting. 
</P>
<P>
He said Bush's proposed education spending amounted to "tepid incrementalism."

A 19-year-old Reseda man has surrendered to police in the hit-and-run death of 
a 9-year-old Canoga Park boy, Los Angeles police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Kayvon Shapoor Kadjar was booked on suspicion of committing felony hit-and-run 
after he turned himself in to police at the Devonshire station about two hours 
after the accident, which occurred at 7:30 p.m. Monday near Nordhoff Street and 
Comanche Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Kadjar was released on $1,000 bail, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County coroner's officials identified the boy as Christopher 
Deanfrasio. 
</P>
<P>
Police said two motorists who witnessed the incident chased the suspect for 
several blocks but lost track of the 1986 tan Toyota truck, which reportedly 
sped away from the scene.

U.S. MOVES TO IMPROVE TIES TO NICARAGUA

<P>
The Bush Administration today moved toward restoring normal relations with 
Nicaragua, announcing it will soon lift sanctions, return an ambassador to 
Managua and assemble a package of economic aid. 
</P>
<P>
A key lawmaker briefed by President Bush said the package could amount to 
hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the United States is ready to help 
at "re-integrating Nicaragua into the international economy." 
</P>
<P>
But, in a message that seemed primarily aimed at the Contra rebels long 
supported by the Reagan and Bush Administrations, Fitzwater urged restraint. He 
reiterated a U.S. call for an immediate cease-fire "under U.N. supervision and 
that it be strictly respected by all sides." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater's comments backed up the Administration's message to Contra rebels to 
"cool it" and avoid provoking a hostile Sandinista response from loyalists to 
defeated President Daniel Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always anticipated that the resistence would demobilize and repatriate 
under conditions of political freedom and personal security," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The President's spokesman said the Administration will respond to the changes 
in Nicaragua's government with a series of steps designed to normalize 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to lift economic sanctions soon," he said, referring to a series of 
economic and trade sanctions in place since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
While saying he could not give a precise timetable, he added: "We are examining 
not only the narrow aspects of U.S. trade sanctions but are looking at the full 
range of economic options aimed at re-integrating Nicaragua into the 
international economy." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater also said that "we would expect to return an ambassador there" and 
that "we are looking at U.S. economic assistance." 
</P>
<P>
Although the United States has continued to maintain formal diplomatic 
relations with Nicaragua, there has not been a U.S. ambassador in Managua since 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Bush invited President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro to send economic aides 
to Washington to discuss the aid package and economic restructuring, Fitzwater 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said Bush called former President Ronald Reagan on Monday 
night "to acknowledge his years of support for the cause of freedom in 
Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Bush summoned Democats and Republicans in Congress to the White House 
for a briefing by Secretary of State James A. Baker III on the developments. 
</P>
<P>
"The President indicated that there would be a dramatic and swift change in 
policy" by the United States, said assistant Democratic leader Alan Cranston of 
California. "What we can do in terms of aid depends upon what Congress can find 
along with the Administration in a very tight budget situation." 
</P>
<P>
However, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said, "You're talking about hundreds of millions 
of dollars" over a four- to five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested creating an "emerging democracy account" in foreign policy aid to 
deal with countries emerging from communist or totalitarian rule.

<P>
A determined Mikhail S. Gorbachev today pushed through the legislature his 
proposal for a Western-style super-presidency despite vigorous objections that 
the new post would concentrate too much power in one man's hands. 
</P>
<P>
Amid shouts of protest from lawmakers who warned of the dangers of 
dictatorship, Gorbachev called the vote for his proposal "a great political 
event in the history of our state." 
</P>
<P>
The vote in the Supreme Soviet was 347 to 24, with 43 abstentions, in favor of 
the bill that approves creation of the presidency in principle. The bill now 
goes to committees that will consider numerous amendments proposed during a day 
of heated debate. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the Congress of People's Deputies, the Supreme Soviet's parent body, will 
meet March 12-13 to elect a president. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would give the president sweeping powers to declare war, veto 
legislation, impose a state of emergency and call referendums on legislative 
decisions he doesn't approve of. 
</P>
<P>
During the debate today, liberals said the creation of a presidency is 
premature, and they accused the leadership of trying to rush the issue through. 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev angrily rejected critics, saying they had engaged in "cheap 
demagoguery." Legislators shouted in protest from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything I believe necessary to say I'll say," the 58-year-old Kremlin chief 
shouted back. 
</P>
<P>
One legislator, a taxi driver from the Ukraine who last year compared Gorbachev 
to Napoleon on national television, said he saw a bad omen in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the voting went from the floor today is the same way presidential 
power will be," shouted Leonid Sukhov in an obvious reference to Gorbachev's 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-democracy demonstrators in several Soviet cities over the weekend said the 
president would become a dictator, and one sign at a Leningrad rally warned 
that the new post could lead to fascism. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet refused on Feb. 14 to be stampeded into setting a timetable 
for approving a presidency modeled after the American and French systems. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has said a strong president is needed as part of his blueprint for 
transferring power from the Communist Party to the government. It is a radical 
departure from Soviet political practice stretching to the days of Josef 
Stalin, when the party leader was supreme ruler. 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, liberals led by Sergei Stankevich, a student of American 
politics and spokesman for the Inter-Regional Deputies Group, and Anatoly 
Sobchak, a Leningrad legislator, said the presidency as proposed would be 
subject to abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"All our decisions can be crossed out by the president," Sobchak told the 
542-member legislature. 
</P>
<P>
He and Stankevich said the proposed presidency would tilt the balance of power 
toward the chief executive and away from the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Many Soviets see the need for an iron hand to solve the country's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tired from social tension. When are you going to put the country in 
order?" legislator Rano Ubaidullaeva said her constituents are saying. "We need 
a person who can have real power . . . the quicker the better."

'A GREAT TIME TO BE PRESIDENT' -- DUKAKIS;

POLITICS: THE LOSER IN THE 1988 ELECTION CHALLENGES PRESIDENT BUSH TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF HIS 'EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INTERNATIONAL 
LEADERSHIP.'

"It's a great time to be President," said Michael S. Dukakis, who isn't. 
</P>
<P>
The Massachusetts governor visited his might-have-been home for an East Room 
reception with President Bush on Monday and afterward said he knows he is 
missing out on a spate of good news. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't stay up nights on the subject," Dukakis said. "I must say that this 
would be a great time to be President of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis, who has had no such luck with affairs in Massachusetts over the last 
year, reflected on how events have smiled on his political nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
"We're living through history here. This is unprecedented. The Cold War has 
defined everything about our lives about our country, about the world, and all 
of a sudden, nobody predicted it, it seems to be sliding away." 
</P>
<P>
The question, Dukakis said, is what Bush can make of the opportunities that 
have fallen into his lap. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that this is a very good time for the country, providing we 
take advantage of what is an extraordinary opportunity to provide international 
leadership. . . . If the Administration does a good job of that, then they're 
going to be successful, and if they don't, then somebody else is going to be 
President." 
</P>
<P>
Sporting a cast on his left hand because he broke two fingers on Saturday 
trying to push a car out of snow, Dukakis made his second trip to the White 
House since losing to Bush in the November, 1988, presidential election. He is 
in town to take part in the annual National Governors' Assn. meeting. 
</P>
<P>
As one with direct experience in the field of changing political fortunes, 
Dukakis warned Bush not to grow overconfident, especially now that a favorite 
Republican enemy -- communism -- appears to be waning as a major issue. 
</P>
<P>
"The Republicans have always had this defense thing and, you know, Bush used it 
against me and in retrospect, who was the most accurate forecaster? It was the 
Democratic nominee," Dukakis said. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know. Things change in this business." 
</P>
<P>
The successful elections Sunday in Nicaragua, Dukakis said, are an example of 
the bankruptcy of the Reagan-Bush policy of military aid to the Nicaraguan 
Contra rebels. It was a diplomatic approach that opened the door to free 
elections, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the record? There was no progress toward genuinely open, free, 
internationally supervised elections until the Contra effort effectively was 
killed," Dukakis said. "What does that tell you?"

Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel today paid homage to the late human rights 
activist Andrei D. Sakharov, one of the few Soviets who openly welcomed the 
1968 Prague Spring reforms and denounced the Soviet-led invasion of 
Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Havel visited the grave with Sakharov's widow, Yelena Bonner, and Czechoslovak 
Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier. 
</P>
<P>
They placed flowers among the many bouquets that are constantly replenished by 
mourners. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, Czechoslovakia's first non-Communist leader in 41 years, also met with 
Soviet legislators and suggested an exchange of parliamentary delegations, with 
the Czechoslovak side led by Alexander Dubcek, the former Communist Party chief 
who authored the 1968 reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Dubcek's last two official visits to Moscow were humiliating. In the first, 
days after the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion, he was under arrest. In the 
second, two months later, he signed an agreement allowing Soviet troops to stay 
on Czechoslovak soil indefinitely and promising the country would return to 
Soviet-style, hard-line rule.

ORDERS FOR DURABLE GOODS FALL SHARPLY; 
</P>
<P>
FACTORIES: JANUARY DECLINE OF 10.5% BIGGEST SINCE FIGURES HAVE BEEN TRACKED. 
AIRCRAFT DROP LEADS WAY.

<P>
Orders to U.S. factories for durable goods plunged 10.5% in January, the 
biggest decline since orders first were tracked 32 years ago, the government 
reported today. A drop in aircraft orders led the way. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items 
expected to last more than three years -- totaled a seasonally adjusted $118.2 
billion last month after increasing a revised 1.4% in December. That figure 
originally was reported to be up 2.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The steepest decline until January's record was a 9.2% fall in February, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the decline was in transportation equipment," the department said. 
"Aircraft and parts, which had been unusually high in the last several months, 
accounted for nearly half of the January decline in transportation, although 
motor vehicles and parts and shipbuilding and tanks were both down sharply." 
</P>
<P>
Aircraft orders represented one-third of the overall decline. Auto production 
also fell in January as tens of thousands of auto workers were laid off to help 
the industry shrink swollen inventories. The department considers car orders 
and production to be the same. 
</P>
<P>
The drop helped pull overall transportation orders down 27.6% to $27.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the economy's recent weakness has been concentrated in durable goods as 
the Federal Reserve sought for more than a year to drive down inflation by 
keeping a tight rein on credit. The result has been higher interest rates, 
which adversely affect durable goods orders because they often are financed by 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the transportation industry, orders fell 3.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The closely watched non-defense capital goods sector, often a barometer of 
business investment plans, fell 13.7%, reversing December's 14.2% gain. The 
sector also posted gains in October and November. 
</P>
<P>
Electrical machinery orders dropped 17.6% to $18.8 billion after rising 5.6% in 
December and 7.3% in November. Virtually all the decrease was in communications 
equipment, the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Orders for non-electrical machinery, including computers and a wide variety of 
industrial equipment, rose 2.6% to $22.3 billion after falling 3.9% in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Primary metals orders were up 1.5% to $11.1 billion following a 2.8% decline in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
New orders for defense capital goods, a highly volatile sector, plummeted 36% 
to $6.3 billion for the lowest one-month volume of orders since January, 1987. 
Defense orders had slipped 12.9% in December after rising 17.7% in November. 
Excluding defense, orders would have been off 3.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Shipments of durable goods in January dropped 3.7% to $117.7 billion after 
falling 0.8% a month earlier.

FED CHIEF WARNS AGAINST CHANGES IN SOCIAL SECURITY

Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said today that a controversial 
proposal to cut the Social Security tax would hamper efforts to reduce the 
federal budget deficit and warned lawmakers not to tinker with the retirement 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee that he also 
opposes plans to move the retirements benefit program off the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned that they will ultimately be counterproductive and hamper the 
efforts needed to meet our longer-term fiscal responsibilities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In opposing the proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) to reduce the 
Social Security tax, the Fed chairman sided with President Bush, who urged 
Congress in his State of the Union address not to change the system. 
</P>
<P>
"Assuming that benefits evolve according to existing laws -- and that Social 
Security revenues are set aside rather than used to lower other taxes or raise 
other outlays -- the system moves in the direction of actuarial soundness; it 
confers no windfall gains or unforeseen losses on any particular generation," 
Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan has argued that his proposal would end the charade in which the 
surplus for Social Security created by payroll taxes makes the federal budget 
deficit appear far smaller than it actually is. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said he is sympathetic to Moynihan's frustration with the slowness of 
deficit reduction and the fact that Social Security trust funds are used to 
mask the size of the deficit, but said, "I regret that I disagree with his 
solution." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed tax cut would mainly benefit middle-income Americans. But it would 
add $55 billion to the fiscal 1991 budget deficit unless other taxes were 
increased or government spending were cut by that amount. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, chairman of a blue-ribbon task force that recommended Social 
Security reforms adopted in 1983, said Moynihan's proposal does not address the 
fundamental problems facing the U.S. economy.

"The Wonder Years" and steamy "Santa Barbara" are among the television shows

<P>
Formerly one of Poland's two government-operated channels offering a slim

converted into a commercial operation under Poland's new, non-communist 
government. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released with the announcement Monday, Conduit Internationale 
said it reached an agreement with the New World International production 
company to provide "The Wonder Years" for Channel 2. 
</P>
<P>
Other New World features heading for Poland include the daytime soap opera 
"Santa Barbara" and the crime-adventure show "Wise Guy."

STATUE'S ROAD BECOMES ROCKY AGAIN

Rocky Balboa is down but not out. 
</P>
<P>
A crew worked two hours with a diamond-tipped circular saw and jackhammer to 
free the 8 1/2-foot bronze likeness of the movie boxing champ from the steps of 
the Philadelphia Museum of Art before returning it to the Spectrum sports 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
But fans of the South Philadelphia palooka played by Sylvester Stallone said 
Monday that they will fight to return the 800-pound statue to the stone 
stairway made famous in the original "Rocky." 
</P>
<P>
Museum President Robert Montgomery Scott has said that the statue is a movie 
prop, not art, and that he doesn't want it in front of the classical building. 
</P>
<P>
Among those working to keep the statue there is James Binns, a lawyer and 
former boxing commissioner hired by Stallone. In Binns' corner is Mayor W. 
Wilson Goode, who has come out in favor of the statue as a tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
The city Art Commission said it will wait 60 days before determining whether 
the statue of Rocky in boxing trunks, arms raised in triumph, will be returned 
to the steps. 
</P>
<P>
The statue, which appeared at the museum during the shooting of "Rocky III" in 
1981, was taken back from the Spectrum for filming of "Rocky V." Filming ended 
Friday, clearing the way for the producers to honor their contract to move the 
statue. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel kind of bad," said Bret Carpin, one of the workers who cut the figure 
from its concrete base. "I hope he doesn't hold it against us." 
</P>
<P>
The museum was closed Monday as usual, but a crowd of TV camera crews, 
photographers and curious museum employees circled the statue. 
</P>
<P>
In the original "Rocky," which won the Oscar for best picture in 1976, Rocky 
runs up the stone steps in triumph while training for a fight. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles publicist for "Rocky V," Dave Fulton, said of the statue's 
fate, "It's pretty much up to the people of Philadelphia. It's out of our 
hands."

Singer Marian Anderson, whose concert before Eleanor Roosevelt in 1939 was a 
landmark in the fight against segregation, is asking black Americans to stand 
up and be counted in the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, the Census Bureau on Monday 
unveiled a campaign to reach as many blacks as possible after roughly 5% were 
missed in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't know now, they'll learn a little bit later that it really pays 
to stand up and be counted," said Anderson, 88, who retired 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
On April 9, 1939, Anderson sang in Washington before an illustrious audience, 
including Mrs. Roosevelt, at the Lincoln Memorial after she was barred from 
appearing in Constitution Hall by the Daughters of the American Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau issued a poster Monday showing Anderson performing on the 
steps of the Lincoln Memorial. The poster urges blacks to "Lift Up Your Voice. 
Stand up for who you are. Answer the census on April 1, 1990."

Even stars have to wait for their luggage in airports. Just ask Harry 
Belafonte. 
</P>
<P>
Belafonte arrived Sunday at Indianapolis International Airport for a lecture as 
part of Black History Month. 
</P>
<P>
The globe-trotting singer-activist spent more than half an hour waiting for his 
luggage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like this all over the world," he said with a laugh. "There are a lot of 
people standing around, so I guess I'm safe -- so far." 
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old performer nearly went unnoticed by people passing through the 
airport, but Jayne Hale of Oxford, Ind., recognized him and had him autograph 
an airline menu. 
</P>
<P>
"He was going strong when I was young," said Hale, 48. "I wasn't sure that was 
him until I heard him speak." 
</P>
<P>
But then, she has an eye for celebrity. On a flight earlier Sunday, she had 
singer Tom Jones sign the same menu.

LIZ SMITH: ROONEY CONTROVERSY HAS CBS ON THE DEFENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Liz Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CBS HAS been backing up to the hairbrush over the Andy Rooney controversy which 
came to be a much stickier nettle than anybody at that network wanted to grasp. 
It was like the "Jumping Cholla" cactus of Arizona; CBS was closer to the sting 
than they thought. This recent incident, wherein Andy insulted, first, gays and 
then, according to the gay magazine The Advocate, went on to insult blacks, had 
Rooney apologizing for the former, but denying doing the latter. CBS headman 
David Burke suspended Rooney for three months anyway. And now, feeling and 
thinking souls at CBS -- crawling under an avalanche of mail and protests that 
run 90% in Andy's favor -- want Burke to bring a quick end to it. 
</P>
<P>
HERE ARE some facts and thoughts you might have missed. At first, Burke fired 
Rooney straight out, totally. Andy was "out the door," as they say. The issue 
wasn't so much whether Rooney had made biased statements but that he had 
behaved in an insubordinate manner. Burke has had to take the heat for 
suspending Andy and not taking Rooney's word for it that he hadn't done what 
The Advocate said he did. But, in reality, Burke was in no position to state 
publicly what his action was for without more embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
Those denizens of "60 Minutes," Don Hewitt, Mike Wallace and Ed Bradley, all 
went to bat for Andy, who they do not believe is a racist. They talked Burke 
into making the punishment something less than a firing. At first Burke changed 
it to a six-month suspension, then downgraded that to three. 
</P>
<P>
THE PUBLIC majority wants Andy back even if he made mistakes or didn't use good 
judgment or expressed himself sloppily. And some want Andy back no matter WHAT 
he said or did. You can whomp up a good and maybe even important argument these 
days about Andy Rooney and "free speech." And whether a man hired to give 
opinions on the air is allowed to have opinions. 
</P>
<P>
The interesting comment on all this is by writer Peter Davis of Newsday. He 
says that blandness flourishes on the Big Three networks and that the "dirty 
secret" of CBS is that an all-white, male-dominated hierarchy is extra 
scrupulous about not offending gays, blacks, women or other minorities. They 
don't intend to hire importantly from such groups if they can avoid it and so 
hope bending over backward takes off some of the heat. 
</P>
<P>
As Davis puts their philosophy, it is "See how fair we white males are -- we 
even kick people out who say anything about the rest of you guys." 
</P>
<P>
ANDY ROONEY has been asking, in effect, "How do we get out of this mess?" He 
takes the blame heaped on him -- and the praise -- to heart. He has been mea 
culpa-ing all over the place in private. He knows he didn't handle any of this 
well. Burke's problem, however, is not to be perceived as a weak manager, a 
wimp, an executive who doesn't mean what he says. 
</P>
<P>
It may be said there are no winners in this mess. But actually there can be. If 
gay radicals could believe more in "educating" the public in their favor rather 
than in dire punishments for all who offend them, they can see Andy back on the 
air as a chastened man who saw the light. Public consciousness HAS been raised. 
On the issue of racism, I think we should accept the word of a 40-plus veteran 
journalist that he didn't say those things. And he'll be watching his step in 
the future on this issue too.

Roush Racing has suspended crew chief Robin Pemberton for 30 days for using an 
illegal engine part on Mark Martin's winning car at the Pontiac 400. 
</P>
<P>
Martin's victory on Sunday at Richmond, Va., was allowed to stand, but the 
racing team was fined $40,000 and lost its championship points. 
</P>
<P>
The record fine by NASCAR was assessed because the team's Ford was found to 
have an illegal 2 1/2-inch spacer on the carburetor. Spacers up to 2 inches are 
legal. 
</P>
<P>
Team manager Steve Hmiel disagreed with NASCAR. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't accept the notion that it was an illegal part," Hmiel said. "That is 
a gray area as far as we are concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Team owner Jack Roush has 30 days to appeal. If he does, a three-person panel 
would be selected from the Stock Car Racing Commission to make a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Hmiel said that Pemberton was suspended without pay because Hmiel was not 
informed that the 2 1/2-inch spacer was being used at Richmond and that Roush 
knew about it but was assured by Pemberton that there would be no problem.

It could happen if the Orioles succeed with their latest Triple A addition, 
left-hander Daniel Boone, whose seventh great-grandfather was John Boone, 
brother of the famous pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
"That's stuck with me since elementary school, when everybody would be singing 
songs about Daniel Boone," Boone said. "I've had a lot to overcome in my life." 
</P>
<P>
The team announced the signing today. 
</P>
<P>
Boone, 36, hasn't appeared in the majors since 1982. Until joining the 
Bradenton Explorers of the Senior League this winter, he hadn't pitched 
professionally since 1984. "That's how you get sleepers," said Orioles General 
Manager Roland Hemond. 
</P>
<P>
The knuckle baller finished 4-3 with a 3.16 earned run average for Bradenton. 
Eight of his 13 appearances were starts, and three were complete games. 
</P>
<P>
He appeared in 57 games with San Diego and Houston in 1981-82, but his last 
professional team before Bradenton was Pittsburgh's Triple A affiliate in 
Vancouver in 1984.

MANFUSO BROTHERS TO STEP DOWN AS EXECUTIVES AT PIMLICO, LAUREL

<P>
Like sculptors stepping back and finding their work good, Bob and Tom Manfuso 
have relinquished the leadership of Maryland racing. 
</P>
<P>
The co-owners of Laurel and Pimlico will withdraw from active management, 
effective after the Preakness on May 19. 
</P>
<P>
Holders of 50% equity in Laurel and 47% of Pimlico, the brothers are stepping 
down as executive vice presidents. Bob Manfuso will remain co-chairman (with 
Joseph A. De Francis) of the boards and Tom Manfuso will remain vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Both offer their continuance as policy makers "as needed." 
</P>
<P>
As members of the team that bought Laurel in 1984 and Pimlico in 1986 in 
partnership with the late Frank De Francis, the Manfusos in a statement took a 
bow for the "solid foundation" they leave under Maryland thoroughbred racing. 
</P>
<P>
"Our success has restored pride in the industry and its many participants," Bob 
Manfuso's valedictory said. "And (it has) won the admiration of racing 
enthusiasts throughout the United States and abroad." 
</P>
<P>
When the team bought Laurel, the track had just completed a meeting in which 
the mutuel handle averaged not quite $1.1 million. In the current meeting it is 
averaging more than $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The new total includes intertrack betting at Pimlico, one of the team's several 
successful innovations. It includes Sunday racing, which was another. 
</P>
<P>
The admiration from abroad cited by Bob Manfuso was a reference to Laurel's 
Turf Festival, an elaboration of the classic Washington, D.C., International 
grass race instituted by former owner John Schapiro in 1952.
