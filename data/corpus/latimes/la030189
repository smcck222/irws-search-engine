A chapter is closing in the 103-year history of Raffles Hotel in Singapore. The 
hotel, which once hosted literary greats W. Somerset Maugham, Noel Coward, 
Joseph Conrad and Rudyard Kipling, is being shut for renovation and the 
addition of a wing. ". . . We have to prepare for the next 100 years," said 
Raffles manager Roberto Pregarz, who with the hotel's 300 staff will be laid 
off until it reopens. The 127 rooms -- each named for a famous author -- will 
be closed after the remaining guests check out. An earlier plan to keep open 
the Long Bar, where bartender Ngiam Tong Boon created the Singapore Sling in 
1915, was turned down by the owners, a land company. The hotel was declared a 
historic landmark in 1987.

 -- Mayor Edward I. Koch had a shock when he talked with some young New 
Yorkers. "The language in some cases was un-understandable," he said, coining a 
word. So, Koch and schools Chancellor Richard R. Green have launched a grammar 
and English usage effort. The program will start this spring with "Putting Your 
Best Speech Forward Day," when city teachers will focus on "speech demons" -- a 
list of mispronounced and misused words and phrases compiled by Green. They 
include: "ax" instead of "ask," "pitcher" instead of "picture," "brang" for 
"brought" and "meetcha" for "meet you." And, as Koch used to say, "liberry" 
instead of "library." "It was brought to my attention that I was saying 
'liberry.' I wasn't aware of it," Koch admitted.

 -- George Bush is in demand on college campuses. Rice University, Texas 
A&amp;M University and Bush's alma mater, Yale, have expressed interest in 
becoming the site of his presidential library. "Rice is certainly interested in 
the presidential papers . . . " said George Rupp, president of Rice, where, in 
1978, Bush taught a graduate-level course in organization theory. Bryan Jones, 
head of Texas A&amp;M's political science department, and a colleague, 
presidential scholar George Edwards, drafted a memorandum urging the school to 
explore the possibilities of gaining the library. And even though Newsweek 
quoted Bush as saying he has decided his presidential papers should go to a 
Texas school, Yale is interested. "I'm sure Yale will be making an effort to 
persuade the President to locate his library here or at least some place near 
here," said Jack Siggins, an administrator of Yale's library. SHIRLEY MARLOW

TROUBLED GOMPERS SCHOOL CLIMATE REPORTEDLY COOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The troubled mood at Gompers Secondary School, the city's stellar 
math-science-computer magnet facility in Southeast San Diego, appears much 
improved from last year. 
</P>
<P>
The faculty is attempting to raise academic achievement for neighborhood 
minority students, a point of contention last year, without harming the 
high-powered curriculum that has long attracted white teen-agers bused in from 
other areas, according to a school-district evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
The report cites: improved relations between Principal Marie Thornton and most 
of the faculty; a host of special classes and tutorials to give minority 
students help in basic skills and study habits and to encourage them to 
consider college, and much preliminary work to redesign both the high-powered 
science curriculum and humanities courses for next year to reach more students, 
particularly those at the junior-high level. 
</P>
<P>
However the report also fund continuing problems with: counseling and 
discipline procedures; some aspects of requirements for teachers to teach both 
junior- and senior-high classes and the perception that more attention to 
minority students will ruin the rigorous curriculum that traditionally has 
lured a substantial number of white students to Gompers. 
</P>
<P>
The interim report by the district's evaluation department has been shared with 
Gompers faculty and administrators but has not yet been discussed by the Board 
of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Many, but not all Gompers teachers and parents interviewed this week found that 
the report accurately portrays both progress and unsolved issues at a school 
beset by problems of inequality at the same time it has garnered many national 
awards for academic prowess. 
</P>
<P>
"I am encouraged by what I have seen going on," said chemistry teacher Jay 
Rubin, who last spring was among the more vocal teachers during meetings and 
debates over how to improve the school. "Communications have improved slowly, 
there is progress in talking to each other, and in working on the academic 
curriculum," said Rubin, who as the science department's new chairman is 
heading a committee to revamp science teaching at the junior-high level as part 
of the Gompers Renewal Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Math teacher Hans DeGroot remains skeptical about many academic promises in the 
plan but said "the school climate has gotten better, and I admit to being quite 
impressed with Mrs. Thornton . . . she has made a real effort at being more 
open." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mood Has Changed 
</P>
<P>
English department chairman Karen Wroblewski -- another outspoken teacher last 
year -- noted that six key teachers left during the summer because they 
wouldn't accept the renewal plan drawn up by Supt. Tom Payzant and approved by 
school-district trustees. "The bottom line is that the school is still in 
transition, and many of us are waiting to see what it looks like in the fall" 
when the plan is scheduled to be fully implemented, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"But the mood has changed, yes, a lot of people are trying to see if things can 
be made to work," added Wroblewski, who had a chance to transfer to another 
school but decided to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"I have put a lot of years into Gompers and I'm not ready to go. . . . a lot of 
us are still committed and I felt the school needed some stability." 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the plan calls for expanding the science-math magnet at the junior 
high level to include all seventh- and eighth-graders who live in the school's 
area, almost all of whom are black or Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Gompers restricted the junior-high magnet to a limited number of 
minority students and an equal number of white students, with the bulk of the 
non-white neighborhood students relegated to a different academic program, 
which many perceived as inferior. The smaller all-magnet 9th-through-12th-grade 
high school is not directly affected by the renewal plan. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant drew up the plan in the face of many complaints by teachers and magnet 
parents about school administrators, touched off by a requirement that teachers 
at the high-school level teach at the junior-high level to improve instruction. 
</P>
<P>
The months-long public dispute last year, which included some charges of 
racism, caused a drop-off of students, both white and black, attending the 
school this year. Enrollment is down more than 150 from last year -- largely at 
the junior-high level -- and Gompers administrators are aggressively recruiting 
sixth-graders, both white and black, for next fall. The traditionally long 
waiting list of non-resident students has dwindled, and Thornton said not all 
neighborhood children may want a school with a heavy math-science emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
"Next fall, the school will finally have a single focus, everyone will be a 
magnet student, and I think we'll have better self-esteem" among students, said 
social studies teacher Richard Kadlubowski, the school's teachers' union 
representative and sponsor of the mock-trial debate team. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel there is tension this year anywhere comparable to the last two 
years" among faculty, he said. "We certainly have not gone backwards, though 
there is still much to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Computer teacher Christopher Lawrence, new to Gompers this year, is working on 
a new junior-high computer science course next fall that will allow students to 
work on joint projects with students in other schools. "We're trying to rebuild 
the middle school computer offerings" for all students, he said. Lawrence has 
arranged a field trip Friday to Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena, a type of activity once restricted to certain magnet students. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids, almost all of them will work their hearts out for you," Lawrence 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There are still some strong dissenters, however. Science teacher Toni Wisehart 
maintained that most teachers "are indifferent," drained by the past year's 
disputes "even though the school is more screwed up than ever" because of what 
she said are efforts by Payzant to destroy the school's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Parent Margaret Speckart cited the dwindling number of science fair projects as 
an example of a decline in curriculum quality. Last spring, science department 
teachers decided, during the height of the controversy, to make participation 
voluntary because they no longer wanted to spend extra time on the science 
fair.

OFFICE TOWER NEAR AIRPORT OKD AFTER TRIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council Tuesday approved construction of a 10-story office 
building 80 feet north of the approach corridor to Lindbergh Field -- after the 
developer agreed to trim the height of the building by 39 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed office tower, which in the past has aroused concerns over safety 
from the Air Line Pilots Assn. and the San Diego Unified Port District, will be 
130 feet tall under a compromise between the city and the developer approved in 
a 7-0 vote. Its final design must be approved by City Architect Michael 
Stepner. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots association and the Port District have dropped their objections to 
Cheng Development's plans for the 336,102-square-foot office tower on the block 
bounded by 4th and 5th avenues and Kalmia and Laurel streets, which was 
repeatedly approved by the Federal Aviation Administration, according to a 
Planning Department report and Councilman Bob Filner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Company Protests 
</P>
<P>
The proposal did, however, bring objections from Vincent Bartolotta, attorney 
for Alesio Investment Co., which owns the adjacent 5th Avenue Financial Center 
that houses Mr. A's restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Bartolotta told the council Tuesday that the new structure will pose a hazard 
to both commercial and private aircraft by adding to the terrain another 
high-rise structure that cuts into pilots' safety margin. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern isn't just with the height of the building, it's with the lateral 
side movement," Bartolotta said. "It wouldn't take something as big as what 
flies in and out of (Lindbergh) to eat up 80 feet in a minute." 
</P>
<P>
Bartolotta said private pilots who bank around the east and west sides of his 
building may strike the new structure, particularly in bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fears Discounted 
</P>
<P>
But David Mulliken, an attorney for Cheng Development, said that, although the 
building will be 80 feet from the edge of the approach corridor, it is 1,580 
feet from the center line used by commercial pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Private pilots fly above all the multistory commercial and residential 
buildings in the area, and could not hit the Cheng office tower without first 
slamming into existing residential structures of similar height east and south 
of the proposed building, Mulliken said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"To stand up here and say safety is still an issue is just flat irresponsible," 
Mulliken said. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA ruled in March that the building, then proposed for 190 feet, would not 
pose a hazard. But, when the pilots association and the Port District appealed 
that decision, the FAA told Cheng to remove decorative spires planned for the 
top of the structure and again ruled that the building is not a hazard. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots association again appealed but later withdrew its objection. The 
Port District withdrew its opposition on the condition that the building be 
trimmed to 130 feet, Filner said.

<P>
Los Angeles attorney Patricia Phillips, a member of the state bar's Board of 
Governors, is spearheading an effort to persuade lawyers to be nicer to each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, co-chairwoman of the board's Statewide Committee on Professionalism 
and Public Action, said she's concerned about the "growing numbers of personal 
dogfights" in the courtroom, a problem that seems to be intensifying as 
attorneys' ranks increase. The herd in Los Angeles County now numbers about 
32,000. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips has proposed a "Code of Professional Courtesy," which she borrowed 
from a Texas bar association. 
</P>
<P>
 All right, you attorneys out there. Raise your right hands and repeat the 
following provisions of the code: 
</P>
<P>
 "I will return telephone calls." 
</P>
<P>
"I will not be late for court or for appointments." 
</P>
<P>
"I will cooperate with my opponent as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
"I will never take cheap shots." 
</P>
<P>
The code, needless to say, would be voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
"The law is a ass," Mr. Bumble says in "Oliver Twist." 
</P>
<P>
And it can be peculiar in Los Angeles, where citizens who tear down illegally 
posted signs on city property could face legal problems because the signs are 
technically personal property. 
</P>
<P>
Only law enforcement officers and city Public Works employees are empowered to 
take down such placards, said Christopher Westhoff, a deputy city attorney. In 
one case, he said, "someone who took down a real estate company's signs on city 
property was sued by the company and had to settle out of court." 
</P>
<P>
"The law needs changing," said Tom LaBonge, deputy to City Councilman John 
Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office is drafting an ordinance that would deem illegally 
posted signs as "abandoned," Westhoff said, and, therefore, ripe to be torn 
down. 
</P>
<P>
De Von Smith, a 61-year-old junk dealer from Wampum, Pa., arrived in town 
Tuesday, lugging what he says is the world's largest birthday card. 
</P>
<P>
It's a 53-pound, 1,500-foot-long strip of papers bearing about 35,000 
signatures. The card commemorates the birthdays of the U.S. Constitution and 
George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this was a way that average people, as well as celebrities, could 
get involved in a patriotic project," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, traveling on a bus pass donated by Greyhound Lines, he 
has collected signatures at such diverse spots as Indian reservations in 
Montana, college campuses in Idaho and shopping malls in Florida. He also 
pasted in signatures from such celebrities as then-Vice President George Bush, 
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and actresses Mary Tyler Moore and Lynn Redgrave. 
</P>
<P>
Smith plans to present his card to the White House next year in time for the 
200th anniversary of the ratification of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
He'd hate to be late and have to transfer all those signatures to a card that 
says, "Belated wishes . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Bill Keene, KNX's traffic reporter, received a letter the other day from his 
most prominent car-phone tipster, Catholic Archbishop Roger M. Mahony. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a bit upset about one reference to him 'making a call in his limousi" 
Keene related. "He pointed out that not only does he drive himself, but he has 
an 'unpretentious Oldsmobile.' " 
</P>
<P>
The freeway force hasn't lost a volunteer, though. 
</P>
<P>
"The archbishop said he'd continue to make calls," Keene said. 
</P>
<P>
Either from his car or from his new helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Everything's for sale . . . 
</P>
<P>
A reporter, researching a story about the recent murders of prostitutes in 
South-Central Los Angeles, approached a lady of the night on Figueroa Street. 
The media-wise hooker yelled: "Five dollars a question, five dollars a 
question." 
</P>
<P>
Expense account limitations being what they are, that was the end of the 
interview.

PLANE CARRYING 1 CRASHES OFF SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One person was believed to have been aboard a plane that crashed about 15 miles 
west of San Clemente Island shortly before noon Tuesday, Navy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The flier's condition was not known. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft was an MU-2 Mitsubishi twin-engine turboprop, owned by Flight 
International in Carlsbad. The company is under contract with the Navy to 
provide target practice, but the plane was not operating in that capacity when 
it crashed, said Navy Cmdr. David Dillon, public information officer with the 
Naval Surface Force in Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
The plane "was flying under (Navy) control, working with the Fleet Combat 
Training Center out of Point Loma," Dillon said. "They train air traffic 
controllers; they don't come under us. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy was assisting in the search because there were Navy ships in the area 
when the plane went down, he said.

Denny Stolz, fired as San Diego State's football coach in November, reported to 
his new assignment as men's golf coach Tuesday but said he still has questions 
about his job status. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been assigned to help out (director of golf) John (Klein), and I plan to 
do that as best I can until this is resolved," Stolz said. 
</P>
<P>
Stolz said he would comment no further, except to say that he would continue as 
a golf coach at least until he reaches an agreement with the university about 
how best to honor the remaining time on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
Stolz, 54, has three years remaining on a five-year deal that sources have said 
pays him about $64,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU President Thomas Day said he was surprised by Stolz's comments that the 
issue might not be resolved. Day termed the move "a standard internal personnel 
assignment of duties that an administrative manager does. . . . It's perfectly 
straight forward." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to say whether Stolz agreed to the reassignment or whether the 
university made it by exercising what it considers a contractual right. 
</P>
<P>
The university announced Stolz's reassignment in a news release late Friday 
afternoon. The release stated that Stolz would replace Marty Maher, a part-time 
assistant to Klein who resigned Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Fred Miller said the announcement was timed to coincide with 
Stolz's return from a lengthy vacation. Stolz had been without an assignment 
since he was fired with one game left in the 1988 season. Stolz had a 16-19 in 
three seasons with the Aztecs, leading the team to the Western Athletic 
Conference championship in 1986. He was replaced after the season by Al 
Luginbill, former associate athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Miller also declined to say if Stolz agreed to the move, except to say he was 
surprised to hear that "Denny is having second thoughts." Miller, who was at a 
meeting in Chicago Tuesday, said he plans to meet today with Stolz and Sally 
Rausch, SDSU personnel director. 
</P>
<P>
Stolz had been represented in some discussions with the university by Roy Bell, 
a San Diego lawyer. Bell has been out of town for several weeks at a trial and 
could not be reached for comment. Miller said that Bell's schedule has made 
discussions difficult and indicated the university had grown impatient with the 
pace of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an old saying about fiddling while Rome burns," Miller said. "It's 
been 2 1/2 months (since Stolz's firing). It's time to go on."

MCLAIN'S PAIN FORGOTTEN IN AFTERMATH OF 9-8 CSUN WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Rusty McLain wore an ice bag on his wrist and a broad smile on his face Tuesday 
afternoon in the wake of Cal State Northridge's 9-8 victory over Cal Poly 
Pomona in a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball game at Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
McLain, the Northridge catcher, had taken a foul tip off his wrist during a 
furious home half of the ninth inning that featured a three-run Pomona rally. 
It was McLain who took a relay throw from second baseman Randy Thompson and 
applied the game-ending tag on pinch-runner Brian Grier as the Matadors 
thwarted a last-ditch double steal by the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
"Looks good, feels good," McLain said, looking out toward the scoreboard in 
right field. "Puts a smile on my face." 
</P>
<P>
McLain, a senior, wasn't just talking about the immediate sense of euphoria 
that pervaded the Matador dugout after the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, ranked eighth in the latest Division II poll, improved its record 
to 10-1 overall, 3-0 in conference play, and seems to be getting better every 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a lineup that features at least three freshman starters, only a 15-2 
loss to Cal State Long Beach -- ranked eighth in Division I -- on Feb. 17 mars 
the Matadors' record. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I'm encouraged about is they (Pomona) did a lot of the things Long 
Beach did to us," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said. "Against Long Beach, we 
couldn't handle it. Now it's a couple weeks later, we've been through some 
experiences together and we've grown up some." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pomona, the defending conference champion, continues to struggle. 
The loss dropped the Broncos to 2-12 overall and 1-3 in the CCAA heading into 
this afternoon's game against Northridge at 2:30 at Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having what he described as his worst game of the year, Northridge 
senior right-hander Robert Wheatcroft pitched eight innings and improved his 
record to 5-0. Senior left-hander Fili Martinez relieved Wheatcroft with no 
outs and the bases loaded in the ninth and went on to earn the save. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge also enjoyed what Kernen called the team's best offensive 
performance. The Matadors collected 13 hits, worked pitchers for key walks, 
executed hit-and-run plays and hit behind runners on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
"The confidence is rising," said right fielder Greg Shockey, who had three hits 
and a key groundout that spurred a five-run sixth inning. "We play 'em game by 
game and so far everyone has contributed." 
</P>
<P>
Shockey, McLain and Denny Vigo had run-scoring singles and Anton Siegl had a 
run-scoring double in the first inning that helped Northridge take a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona answered with three runs in the home half of the inning on a three-run 
home run by catcher Chris Goldbach, who finished the day with three hits and 
five runs batted in. The Broncos tied the score in the second and Goldbach put 
them ahead, 5-4, in the fifth with an RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
After the sixth-inning rally, the Matadors cruised into the ninth with a 9-5 
lead. Wheatcroft, however, surrendered two consecutive singles before center 
fielder John Bonilla dropped a fly ball for a one-base error. Goldbach drove in 
a run with a bad-hop single and Kernen motioned for Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez got two quick outs before allowing two runs on a wild pitch and a 
single by Michael Baker. With Grier on third, Baker broke for second with an 
0-2 count on Jim Maguire. As Martinez threw to Thompson, Grier broke for home, 
triggering the game-ending relay.

AGOURA GIRLS HEAD FOR FINAL WITH A STREAK OF 40 VICTORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What has 36 legs, 18 ponytails, 40 consecutive victories and a goalkeeper as 
lonely as the Maytag repairman? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Agoura High girls' soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers smothered visiting Kennedy of La Palma, 5-0, on Tuesday in a 
Southern Section 3-A Division semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
And they hope that life really does begin at 40. Agoura, ranked No. 1 all 
season, will play Anaheim Canyon for the championship Saturday at Gahr High in 
Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura, has won three consecutive 2-A championships and has not lost since 
December, 1986, an unbeaten string of 77 matches. This season, the Chargers 
(25-0) have outscored the opposition, 170-6, and set a Southern Section record 
for goals in a season. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers assaulted three Kennedy goalkeepers with 19 shots. Agoura goalie 
Tricia Arledge, meanwhile, was called upon to make just one save. 
</P>
<P>
Such disparity in the semifinal round? 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, we were a little flat in the second half," Agoura Coach Dave Godwin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Godwin's girls flattened Kennedy (12-10-1), the third-place team from the 
Garden Grove League, with three first-half goals -- four if you count an 
apparent goal that went uncredited after deflecting off the crossbar over the 
goal line. The official, however, failed to notice the line judge signaling a 
goal with her flag. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking," said Godwin, who protested the play frantically, "What am I 
going to do with my coronary arteries if that turns out to be the deciding 
goal?" 
</P>
<P>
Godwin kept on ticking, thanks to some fancy kicking by some familiar feet. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Julie Tingle, who increased her Southern Section-record career assist 
total to 102 with three in the match, scored the Chargers' first goal when she 
booted in a rebound early in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Tingle, dribbling on a breakaway, fed junior Heidi Walters with a perfect 
centering pass. Walters' shot, however, caromed off the goal post back to 
Tingle. 
</P>
<P>
Walters followed with two left-footed goals before halftime to increase her 
team-high total to 29. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not left-footed," she said. "They just came that way." 
</P>
<P>
Said Tingle, who has 43 assists this season: "I cross (pass) it and she kicks 
it in." 
</P>
<P>
Vanessa Martin, a senior, scored two second-half goals on assists from Tingle.

GIANNINI GETS RUSH JUST THINKING ABOUT MONTCLAIR PREP'S BACKFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Montclair Prep football Coach George Giannini mulled the question over for all 
of a second Tuesday before answering with obvious delight. "Nice backfield, 
isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Giannini can be forgiven a February reverie about the 1989 football season. The 
Mounties, who play at the lowest level among Southern Section schools, might 
have the Valley area's best pair of running backs next season. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jones led Southern Section Valley-area rushers last season as a junior 
with 1,514 yards. Jones, a 6-foot-1, 205-pound tailback, averaged 7.2 yards a 
carry and scored 17 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
But it's difficult to believe that he might be only the second-best running 
back on the Van Nuys campus. All-City Section back Derek Sparks transferred 
from Banning and enrolled at Montclair Prep two weeks ago. Sparks (6-1, 200) 
was selected Cal-Hi Sports' sophomore player of the year after rushing for 
1,394 yards and 15 touchdowns in helping Banning to the City 4-A Division title 
game last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Giannini, he doesn't have to choose between the two: Sparks is 
a fullback. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael is my tailback and primary ballcarrier and that stays," Giannini said. 
"They'll be on the field at the same time. They'll complement each other. I've 
made it clear to them they won't be competing against each other." 
</P>
<P>
Giannini has never seen Sparks play nor watched him on film. Giannini said they 
first met three weeks ago when Sparks came to school for an interview. Sparks, 
who said he transferred from the Wilmington school because he feared gang 
problems, chose Montclair Prep because of its rigorous academic standards. He 
also considered Loyola and Crespi last summer when he moved to California from 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"I planned to go to a private school, but the schools were booked so I decided 
on Banning," he said. "But there's a lot of things going on at Banning, things 
I tried to block out." 
</P>
<P>
More Sparks: Sparks ran behind a Banning line that featured All-American Bob 
Whitfield, a 6-7, 275-pound tackle who signed with Stanford. Montclair Prep's 
offensive linemen have never been confused with their Banning counterparts, but 
the Mounties may surprise opponents next season with their size. 
</P>
<P>
Returning is nose guard Don Roy (6-6, 240), who will be moved to offensive 
tackle. He will be joined by Bill Silletti, a 6-6, 255-pound junior who 
transferred from Bell-Jeff in the middle of last semester and did not play 
football. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Billy Butler, a 6-5, 230-pound tight end, will be promoted from the 
junior varsity, joining returning starters Josh Corben (6-2, 195), a sophomore 
guard, and Greg Jones (6-1, 210), a junior tackle and Michael's brother. 
</P>
<P>
Last add Montclair Prep: Giannini said the best thing that has happened to the 
Mountie athletics program was Washington State's 34-30 win over UCLA last fall. 
Keying the Cougars' win were former Mounties Rich Swinton and Tim Stallworth, 
who between them scored all four of Washington State's touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"Montclair Prep was all over TV and the newspapers the next day," he said. 
"That game had a real impact. We've got new students looking at the school 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia question: In the 1980s, which is the only school from the eight-team 
Northwest Valley Conference that has not reached the City Section 4-A Division 
baseball championship game at Dodger Stadium? Answer below. 
</P>
<P>
Saving the best for last: Mitchell Butler said that when it ended, he wanted it 
under his terms. Oakwood was eliminated by Southern California Christian, 
83-74, in a quarterfinal playoff game last Wednesday and Butler's high school 
career came to a close. 
</P>
<P>
But not before one final barrage from Butler, a two-time Small Schools Player 
of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, who will attend UCLA in the fall, scored a school-record 55 points and 
had 25 rebounds. He said that the fourth quarter -- his last in high school -- 
was the best he had ever played. 
</P>
<P>
Butler scored 24 points in the fourth quarter, an average of three points a 
minute. Oakwood scored 33 in the quarter, a school record. 
</P>
<P>
Not worth the weight: Dehydration forced El Camino Real's Noe Valiente to 
forfeit his consolation semifinal match to Richard Endow of Granada Hills in 
the 105-pound division of last weekend's City Section finals. 
</P>
<P>
Valiente, a sophomore, apparently reduced his caloric intake two days before 
the meet to stay below the legal weight, then ate too much the morning of 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I ate very little and pigged out this morning," he said while sitting on a 
stretcher at Saturday's meet. "I used all my strength and felt sick." 
</P>
<P>
Valiente pinned Fred Carretero of Wilson at 1:24 in a preliminary bout before 
being pinned by Birmingham's Malik Ismail in a championship semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman fireball: Freshman point guard Anjanette Dionne averaged 7.8 points a 
game for the Hart girls' team, but she is averaging 14 points in three playoff 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Dionne scored a team-high 20 points in a 78-68 5-A Division semifinal win over 
Buena on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"She's just gotten better as the season's gotten longer," Coach Pam Walker 
said. "For a freshman to have that kind of poise is pretty impressive." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Taft Toreadors last played for the City championship in 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, City champion in 1981 and '85, and Granada Hills, champion in 1984 and 
runner-up in '86, both have made two appearances since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland ('82), Chatsworth ('83) and Canoga Park ('87) all were victorious in 
their only trip to Dodger Stadium. El Camino Real ('84) and San Fernando ('88) 
lost in their only City championship appearances.

STATWATCH: THOMAS INCLUDES FEW TURNOVERS WITH FAVORITE DISHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coaches at Nevada Las Vegas have compared Taft High's Dedan Thomas to former 
Runnin' Rebel star Mark Wade, who set school records for assists. Wade's 
hallmark as a point guard was that no matter what kind of defensive pressure he 
faced, he dished the ball to the right man at the right place at the right 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, a 5-foot-10 senior who will attend UNLV in the fall, did likewise all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas averaged 9.1 assists despite playing for a team that played a 
slow-paced, halfcourt offense. And despite being Taft's only solid ballhandler, 
Thomas turned the ball over only 63 times in 22 games (2.9 a game). 
</P>
<P>
Thomas also averaged 5.3 steals and carried the team scoring load, averaging 
18.5 points. He made 146 of 300 field-goal attempts (48.6%). 
</P>
<P>
Final countdown: El Camino Real senior forward Brent Lofton is arguably the 
best basketball player in school history. Last year, he was named All-City and 
appears a cinch to repeat after averaging 23.7 points and 12.2 rebounds this 
season. In his 2 1/2-year, 50-game varsity career, Lofton scored 1,009 points 
(20.2 average) and had 556 rebounds (11.1). This season, he made 184 of 315 
field-goal attempts (58.4%) and 83 of 116 free throws (71.5%). Lofton's career

DIGEST: ANKLE INJURY SIDELINES HARBOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ankle injury suffered by David Harbour of Camarillo High early in last 
Wednesday's 76-52 basketball playoff loss to Glendora was diagnosed as a broken 
bone in his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the season, the sophomore guard tore ligaments in his left ankle and 
missed several games. Harbour, the Scorpions' scoring leader, also plays 
baseball but will miss the first three to four weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The injury climaxed a rash of ankle and foot mishaps for Camarillo in the last 
week of the season. The Monday before the third-round playoff game against 
Glendora, forward Scott Foster sprained an ankle. On Tuesday, reserve Dominique 
Zuniga broke an ankle. Then, on Wednesday, Harbour went down. 
</P>
<P>
"All stepped on someone else's foot," Camarillo Coach John Harbour said. "I 
think it was a weird, freaky thing." 
</P>
<P>
Harvard High's water polo team, the defending Southern Section 2-A Division 
champion, has been invited to compete in a tournament in Bergmo, Italy, this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the Saracens will train in West Berlin in the same facilities 
where Harvard Coach Rich Corso may coach next season. Corso is considering 
leaving the Harvard program for a club team named Wasserfreunde Spandau 04. 
</P>
<P>
The six-team tournament includes club teams from northern Italy and is 
tentatively scheduled to start the last week in June. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a good way to train," Corso said. "But instead of watching it on 
video, we'll experience it." 
</P>
<P>
David Eagle, a Harvard High senior who was a first-team All-San Fernando Valley 
League tackle, has been named a scholar-athlete by the National Football 
Foundation and Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-4, 245-pound Eagle carries a 3.7 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Butler, two-time Southern Section Small Schools Division Player of the 
Year from Oakwood High, has been selected to play in the McDonald's Wildcat 
Western Classic at University of Arizona on April 15. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Evans, 16, of Glendale has advanced to the national Pepsi-NBA Hotshot 
competition in Cleveland on April 7-10 after winning his 16-18 age division in 
the area final. Brian Holsinger, 13, of Lancaster, lost in the final of his 
division.

COLE KEEPS COOL FOR MADISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget the hair. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the comparison made between Madison boys' basketball player J.J. 
Cole and teammate Robby Robinson might have just been in terms of hair. They 
both wear it long and stringy. Stuff that blows on the fast break. 
</P>
<P>
Cole's jump shot and general coolness in the final minutes of Madison's 58-55 
victory over Point Loma (17-11) in the Division II semifinal playoff game at 
Serra High Tuesday night could change that. Madison backers who will follow 
their team to the Sports Arena for Saturday's final with Torrey Pines are now 
probably a little less uneasy about Robinson's departure at the end of this 
season. Cole is a junior. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't that Cole's numbers were spectacular. Seven points, pale next to 
Robinson's team-leading 19. But Cole picked his spots well. His two jump shots 
in the final 3 minutes kept Madison (17-12) close during a Point Loma hot 
streak midway through the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I had it open a lot, and I didn't take it," Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
When he finally did, the shots were perfect. Cole also hit a free throw with 13 
seconds left to give Madison a three-point lead and force Point Loma to attempt 
a desperation three-pointer at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Madison, which lost to Point Loma twice during the regular season, played with 
intensity throughout, bothering the Pointers with a full-court press and tight 
defense. But in the end, talk hurt the Pointers more than actions. 
</P>
<P>
With 1:33 remaining, Point Loma's Marcel Brown was whistled for a foul while 
attempting to pull down a rebound. He voiced his displeasure and was assessed a 
technical. Madison's Kirk Cummin made two free throws, tying the score at 55. 
</P>
<P>
Madison got the ball back and took the lead on Brad Eaddy's six-footer with 58 
seconds remaining and subsequently took the game away from the Pointers. 
</P>
<P>
The technical was questionable to Point Loma Coach David Aros. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't call a technical in the fourth quarter with 2 minutes to go," Aros 
said. "The call was unwarranted. The referees have to understand that we have 
kids who are excited on the court." 
</P>
<P>
Brown's objection, Aros said, was something to the effect of: "That was a 
(not-so-terrific) call." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said it in the middle of the court, away from both referees but loud 
enough to be heard from a substantial distance. 
</P>
<P>
Aros didn't put the blame on Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (the team) 'All of you have said worse things to a referee. I've said 
worse things to a referee. That's not the reason we lost the ballgame.' We 
didn't play nearly as well as I think we are capable of playing." 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Griffin, usually a big factor in Point Loma's offense, was quiet until 
the fourth quarter, when he scored eight of his 12 points. Madison stole three 
Point Loma passes in the first quarter, all resulting in layups. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma held a 47-45 lead at the end of the third quarter, but Madison 
players continued to be a step quicker on both ends of the court. And a notch 
more intense. It showed on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
"They came out cocky, you could tell," Robinson said. "They were just going 
through the motions. I think we wanted it more." DON PATTERSON

DIVISION I BASKETBALL SEMIFINALS;

SAN DIEGO HAS ENOUGH TO ADVANCE

<P>
In a jigsaw puzzle, a tree with a missing piece is still as tree, just not as 
aesthetically pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
In basketball, a team with one of its top scorers out is still a team, just not 
as effective. 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday night's Division I boys' basketball semifinal at Torrey Pines -- in 
which San Diego defeated Valhalla, 79-67 -- all personnel were accounted for 
but not present. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind, said San Diego Coach Dennis Kane. What matters is the kids on the 
court when it counts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of talking about the kids who are playing and the kids who aren't 
playing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Who was playing: Clark James and Milton Miller for San Diego and Tony Clark for 
Valhalla. Clark finished with a game-high 35 points. James had a team-high 26 
points and Miller added 21. 
</P>
<P>
Who didn't play: Rafid Kiti for Valhalla and Raynard Wells for San Diego. 
Earlier in the day, Kiti suffered a collapsed lung, a condition that kept him 
out of six games in the regular season before he helped the Norsemen reach the 
round of four. 
</P>
<P>
Wells has been ailing academically and has been ineligible since early 
February. 
</P>
<P>
Kane admitted that Kiti's presence would have made for a closer game. 
</P>
<P>
"With Kiti there, it's a different story, but we just had more then they did 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Valhalla played with San Diego in the first quarter but then fell further 
behind as the clocked ticked away. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavers pushed a 17-14 lead after one quarter to 37-32 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
Any kind of a Valhalla comeback was then stifled by James (who scored four 
consecutive times for the Cavers to push them in front, 45-38 with 4:20 
remaining in the third) and Miller (whose four baskets in a row early in the 
fourth gave San Diego a 66-55 lead before Valhalla called a timeout with 4:23 
left). 
</P>
<P>
"When we started hitting," James said, "I knew we could keep it up. Coach said 
with their 2-3 zone, we could get any shot off we wanted. And we did." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't make any excuses," Valhalla Coach Manny Silva said. "Miller and James 
were unbelievable tonight. I didn't feel that they outplayed us though." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he almost wished Kiti had been there. "I think it would have been a 
real great game if he had played." KIM Q. BERKSHIRE

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Efrem Leonard is 100% healthy again, or so he says. Danny Means always has 
been. 
</P>
<P>
For one reason or another (bad knee, pulled hamstring, aggravated groin or 
bronchitis), Leonard has missed eight games this year for the University of San 
Diego men's basketball team, including seven in the West Coast Athletic 
Conference. Means, the Toreros' Lou Gehrig, hasn't missed a game in his 
four-year career. 
</P>
<P>
Together, Leonard and Means represent the Toreros' senior class. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday against U.S. International University, in their final game in the USD 
Sports Center, Leonard and Means started in the back court together for only 
the second time this year. 
</P>
<P>
The combination was worthy. Leonard and Means led a spirited USD attack for a 
91-78 victory in front of 1,044 fans. 
</P>
<P>
"The seniors made the difference tonight," said USD forward Gylan Dottin, who 
scored a team-high 23 points. "They came out hitting everything. And we just 
followed their lead." 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly. You see, it was Dottin who scored the game's first points -- three 
of them on a layup and a free throw after a Gary Williams foul. 
</P>
<P>
USD never trailed as the Toreros won for the second time in three games after 
losing six in a row. USD improved to 8-19. USIU finished its season 11-17. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased with the season we had," said Gull Coach Gary Zarecky, whose 
team finished one game better than last season's 10-18. "A few breaks and we 
might have won 15 or 16 ball games. And we're young." 
</P>
<P>
Matt Judd is the only senior; the Gulls have nine juniors on their roster. USIU 
also played Tuesday's game without leading scorer Demetius Laffitte, who 
injured his right knee in the Gulls' loss to San Diego State University 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Said Zarecky, "I don't think there's a coach in the country who can loose his 
best player and have the team play up to its potential." 
</P>
<P>
USD Coach Hank Egan had his team playing near its potential. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, USD led, 50-42, as the Toreros shot 54% (14 of 26) from the 
floor and 76% (19 of 25) from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
The 50 points was a high for USD in the first half this season (the Toreros 
scored 48 against Loyola Marymount). Leonard and Dottin had 12 points each and 
Kelvin Woods 11. 
</P>
<P>
USIU was paced by Williams and Paul Wilson with 15 and 13 points. The Gulls 
shot 43%, and 56% from the line. USD outrebounded the Gulls, 24-15. 
</P>
<P>
Never trailing, USD patiently built a 39-27 lead with 6:50 left in the half. 
But USIU cut that to 39-37 with a 10-point surge. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, USD took control with an 11-2 run that gave them a 70-58 
lead with 8:58 remaining. The Toreros, hot in the first half, were even better 
in the second. 
</P>
<P>
USD made 56% (13 of 23) from the floor and 78% (14 of 18) from the free-throw 
line. In addition to Dottin's 23 points, Woods finished with 17, Leonard 16, 
Craig Cottrell 14 and Means nine. 
</P>
<P>
"We executed pretty well," Egan said. "We got the shots when we wanted them, 
and we made them." 
</P>
<P>
USIU's Paul Wilson finished with a game-high 33 points. Williams added 16 and 
Paul Sterner 11. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Leonard, now healthy, talked of the future. "I'm able to run. 
My legs feel great . . . " 
</P>
<P>
And Means, who always has been healthy, talked of the past. "It's been a long 
time. I can't even remember that first game." 
</P>
<P>
You won Danny, 63-54, over Nevada Reno.

DIRK SUTRO ARCHITECTURE: OUT-OF-TOWNER HAS A FEEL FOR SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dirk Sutro 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years, a wave of buildings by famous out-of-town architects has hit 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Graves, Mitchell/Giurgola, Antoine Predock, Helmut Jahn and Skidmore 
Owings Merrill are among the big names coming to town. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, though, these architects are merely importing signature styles, 
with little regard for how architecture can be adapted to unique aspects of our 
culture and climate. 
</P>
<P>
That's not true of Charles Moore, who has five of his designs under 
construction in San Diego -- intelligent, inspiring projects suited to the 
region and quite different from what he's done in other cities. In addition to 
this sensitivity, Moore has shown an uncanny ability to make architecture a 
collaborative process, one in which he and his co-designers effectively listen 
to clients and citizens, then produce buildings that meet their needs while 
retaining the architects' strong imprint. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Known for Sea Ranch 
</P>
<P>
Moore is best known for his 1960s designs at Sea Ranch, an enclave of vacation 
homes along the coast of Northern California where the architect adapted a 
woodsy-shed vocabulary to scenic coastal bluffs, with a special concern for 
bringing natural light into the spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, his slate of projects has ranged from the Piazza d' Italia in New 
Orleans, a Cubist collage of classical forms and moving water, to many large 
public and university buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Moore has taught at several architecture schools, including Yale, UCLA and, at 
the moment, the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
His current San Diego agenda includes the Oceanside Civic Center (in 
conjunction with Urban Innovations Group) now under construction; a theater 
complex for the city of Escondido (designed by Moore in conjunction with John 
Ruble and Buzz Yudell, based in Santa Monica); a molecular biology research lab 
on the UC San Diego campus (also by Moore, Ruble, Yudell); a church in 
Fairbanks Ranch (in conjunction with San Diego's Austin Hansen Fehlman Group), 
and a building for Phoenix House -- a program for troubled high school students 
-- several miles east of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Moore commented on San Diego recently by phone from his home and studio in 
Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
He called Escondido's new City Hall, designed by Pacific Associates Planners 
and Architects of San Diego, a "very skillful piece of work. I think that the 
openness to the outdoors, the way it opens outward toward the park and toward 
the entrance circle, all are very much in the spirit of Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
In mid-February, Yudell presented initial ideas for the theater complex to 
Escondido city officials. Although it's too early to give specifics, Moore and 
his partners have some ideas as to how they will design the complex, with its 
1,700-seat theater, smaller theater and outdoor amphitheater in Grape Day Park. 
</P>
<P>
Moore acknowledged the lack of a strong architectural heritage from which to 
draw on in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
"Our building's happening mostly from the inside out, in the time-honored way 
architects of my generation were taught. Considerations of what kind of light 
will be in the theater will have more to do 
</P>
<P>
with what the building looks like than any image we've got." 
</P>
<P>
In a different way, the Oceanside Civic Center, scheduled to open later this 
year, also fits its setting. The design acknowledges nearby buildings by early 
San Diego architectural master Irving Gill, but not in a literal way. Where 
Gill was known for rounded arches, Moore's large openings are squared. As with 
some of Gill's buildings, Moore's outdoor spaces are extremely important. A 
plaza at one corner of the project will feature a grove of palm trees and a 
water feature that Moore refers to as an "alluvial fan." 
</P>
<P>
The opportunity for citizens and city officials to offer opinions on the design 
resulted in minor changes, he said. Most significantly, the city bureaucrats 
rejected Moore's first design for the doors to the City Council chamber. 
Instead of colorful baked-on porcelain, they will be made from plain gray metal 
by Texas sculptor Robert Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's Church of the Nativity in Fairbanks Ranch, designed in collaboration 
with the local Austin Hansen Fehlman Group, shares with the Oceanside complex 
sensitive indoor-outdoor relationships and such California details as color 
ceramic tile around windows and doors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harder-Edged Look 
</P>
<P>
The Molecular Biology Building at UCSD, scheduled for completion this spring, 
finds Moore working in concrete and glass, a harder-edged look than the stucco 
that will cover the buildings in Oceanside. But he softens the effect with fine 
detailing, breaking the facades with abstracted pilasters and romantic little 
balconies. A central atrium continues the architect's search for uniquely "San 
Diego" solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Is he developing a San Diego palette? 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly there are things we do elsewhere that I wouldn't think of doing in 
San Diego County," Moore said. "In Oceanside, every design decision reflected 
what Gill would have done, whether he'd approve. I'm torn, because I like Gill 
a lot, but I also like (Bertram) Goodhue," he said, referring to the designer 
of the ornate California Tower in Balboa Park, a 180-degree contrast to the 
stark work of Gill. 
</P>
<P>
What does Moore think of Fairbanks Ranch? 
</P>
<P>
"It would be better if I didn't comment," he said, pausing. "I just don't 
understand it. I think it's meant to be Spanish, but it hardly ever gets the 
feel right." 
</P>
<P>
Downtown San Diego? 
</P>
<P>
He's never visited Horton Plaza, but complimented the historic preservation 
efforts in the Gaslamp Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The UCSD campus? 
</P>
<P>
"I've written negative things about it," said the one-time student of Louis 
Kahn, designer of the masterful Salk Institute just across Torrey Pines Road 
from the campus. "I have never figured out the scheme of the campus. I can't 
locate myself when I'm on it, or understand the relationship between the 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Moore's designs and observations will inspire a more thoughtful 
generation of local buildings in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN NOTES: C. W. Kim, Lorimer-Case and Naegle Associates, all San Diego 
architects, have designed the three proposals recently received by the Centre 
City Development Corp. for a high-rise development at Broadway and State 
Street. Both Lorimer-Case and Naegle hope to cross over from tract home work 
into the high-rise big leagues. . . . The Del Mar Plaza project in downtown Del 
Mar, an eclectic blend of shops and restaurants in a complex designed by Horton 
Plaza architect Jon Jerde, is months behind schedule and as much as $5 million 
over budget, sources say. Developers attribute the difficulties to complex 
improvements for such tenants as the Il Fornaio restaurant.

A multimillion dollar TV ad campaign for Blake Edwards' new R-rated film, "Skin 
Deep," has been toned down because all three networks found the commercials too 
risque, which strikes the film's producer, Tony Adams, as ironic. "The biggest 
hypocrisy is that when the networks promote their own movies, there are no 
bounds. They show the most provocative sex scenes ever," Adams told The Times 
on Tuesday. "We're an R-rated movie, so we know we couldn't air our ads until 
after 9 p.m. 'L.A. Law' has more double-entendres and sex scenes than we were 
showing. In testing the TV spots, we didn't get any negative reaction. But we 
had to pull the whole campaign over the weekend." Edited and "milder" spots 
began airing Tuesday and will blitz the airwaves prior to the film's national 
opening Friday. John Ritter stars in "Skin Deep," which Adams describes as a 
"typical Blake Edwards farce about how difficult it is for a man to change."

Turner Broadcasting will appeal the $9.75 million awarded to actor Timothy 
Hutton by a jury that decided MGM deceived him about the cancellation of the 
1983 film "Roadshow." The MGM film library is now owned by Turner Broadcasting 
and Turner is responsible for certain liabilities associated with past MGM film 
projects, including Hutton's, said Turner attorney Anne Grupp. Turner officials 
"are extremely surprised and disappointed in the verdict," Steve Korn, vice 
president and general counsel at Turner Broadcasting in Atlanta said in a 
prepared statement. "We think it is unjustified and will be overturned in 
future legal proceedings in the case." Hutton's attorney James Tierney said, 
"They have a legal right to appeal," but added that he had not received any 
official notification of an appeal but was confident that the case could 
withstand a challenge in a higher court. "The jury found, as a fact, that Mr. 
Hutton was defrauded by MGM and questions of fact are rarely overturned." 
Hutton, an Oscar-winning actor for the 1980 film "Ordinary People," was awarded 
$2.25 million in compensatory damages and $7.5 million in punitive damages 
Friday by a Superior Court jury that found MGM committed fraud and breach of 
contract. Hutton also claimed MGM deprived him of other possible roles by 
failing to tell him of its decision for several months. The suit charged that 
studio executives told Hutton the modern-day Western was being terminated 
because film director, Richard Brooks, had suffered a heart attack. But the 
actor contended that MGM lost interest in the movie after a change of 
management. ALEENE MacMINN

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD: CHEAP TRICK GETS MORE THAN 
JUST A CHEAP THRILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Much to their delight, the members of Cheap Trick have found that lightning 
can, indeed, strike twice. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a decade after their initial flash-in-the-pan success, the veteran 
Midwestern rockers have finally realized their long-harbored hopes for a 
comeback. Their latest album, "Lap of Luxury," is their highest-charting LP 
since 1979's "Dream Police." Their recent single, "The Flame," is their first 
No. 1 hit, ever. 
</P>
<P>
And, on their current U.S. tour, Cheap Trick is once again playing 
multi-thousand-seat venues -- like the Starlight Bowl in Balboa Park, where 
they will appear Saturday night -- instead of the tiny nightclubs and military 
bases to which they've been relegated for the better part of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"Having hits again has added 10 years to our career; it's added some quality 
time as opposed to quantity time," said guitarist Rick Nielsen in a telephone 
interview. "We appreciated our success the first time, but this time, we 
appreciate it even more. 
</P>
<P>
"Suffering all those setbacks and then being given a second chance -- we're 
thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1981, Cheap Trick enjoyed a brief reign as the hottest pop act in 
the country. They consistently topped the charts and broke box-office records 
with their buoyant, catchy music and a campy stage show that pitted Nielsen's 
clownish mugging and maniacal guitar gymnastics against lead singer Robin 
Zander's good looks and sensual gyrations. 
</P>
<P>
As is so often the case, however, Cheap Trick's days in the spotlight were 
numbered. But, even after the hits stopped coming, Nielsen said, "We continued 
to tour, we continued to try to make good records, and we didn't give up." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Cheap Trick's perseverance paid off. When it came time to record 
"Lap of Luxury," Nielsen said, "we wanted to make the best record we could, as 
always, but we were also more determined than ever to have a hit, to get back 
on radio. 
</P>
<P>
"So, instead of putting whatever we came up with on the album, as we did in the 
past, we worked with outside writers and among ourselves to come up with 50 
songs, and then we got together with our management and our record company and 
picked the 10 we felt stood the best chance of becoming commercial hits." 
</P>
<P>
The ploy worked and, sure enough, put Cheap Trick back on top -- to the point 
that the band's average box-office take is "from double to 10 times what it was 
a year ago," Nielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, we're not exactly loaded," he added. "We've been in debt for so many 
years, it will take us two comebacks just to break even." 
</P>
<P>
Last November, Paul Abramson obtained zoning approval from San Diego's planning 
department to open a teen-age nightclub in the Adams Avenue Theater, pending 
his purchase of the building at a foreclosure auction scheduled for mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
According to the 27-year-old La Jolla entrepreneur, the club, named Van 
Richter, was to open sometime in May and offer the 17 to 25 "young adult" crowd 
a mix of recorded dance music and occasional concerts by underground bands like 
Cabaret Voltaire, Ministry and Front 242, most of them hipper-than-thou exports 
from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But now the fate of the club is up in the air. Two weeks ago, Abramson received 
a letter from associate planner Kevin McGee, informing him that Van Richter's 
maximum legal area had been reduced from 8,000 square feet -- the entire 
building -- to just 5,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
No can do, Abramson said. 
</P>
<P>
"What they're basically asking me to do is turn what has always been a 
single-use building into a multi-use building, and that simply won't work," 
Abramson said. "I would have to hire a structural engineer to build a 25-foot 
retaining wall in there, and it would not only be impractical, but the cost 
would be astronomical." 
</P>
<P>
Planner McGee said his decision to "take a second look" at Abramson's permit 
was prompted by a request by the Normal Heights Community Development Corp. The 
CDC has long opposed the idea of a teen-age nightclub in Normal Heights, even 
going so far as to try to purchase the building itself last year before the 
foreclosure (their offer was rejected). 
</P>
<P>
"Under zoning restrictions in that area, the size of theaters, nightclubs and 
bars is limited to 5,000 square feet," McGee said, except in cases where the 
new business is similar to the business it is replacing. Originally, he added, 
"based on information Mr. Abramson had provided us with," it was determined 
that the club and the previous occupant, Lawrence Gray Ministries, were, 
indeed, similar, because one put on gospel concerts and the other techno-pop 
dances. 
</P>
<P>
"But, at the community planning group's request," McGee said, "we took it to 
the city attorney, and he didn't agree." 
</P>
<P>
Adamson said he would appeal the planning department's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper's new album, "Root Hog or Die," should 
be in local record stores any day now. The dynamic duo of depravity's fourth 
Enigma Records release includes such irreverent ditties as "Debbie Gibson Is 
Pregnant With My Two-Headed Love Chile' " and "Louisiana Liplock," as well as 
an upbeat rendition of Woody Guthrie's "This Land Is Your Land," in which Nixon 
has added an uproarious mid-song rap. . . . The 13th annual concert series at 
San Diego State University's Open Air Theater gets under way March 25 with an 
appearance by British techno-pop heavyweights Duran Duran. Tickets go on sale 
Friday at 3 p.m.

K.T. Oslin, who won two Grammys last week, kept the momentum going Tuesday when 
she was nominated five times in the 24th annual Academy of Country Music 
Awards. The singer-songwriter is up for "Hat" awards for female vocalist, album 
of the year, single of the year ("I'll Always Come Back") and video of the year 
(where she was named twice). George Strait, Kathy Mattea, Ricky Van Shelton, 
Tanya Tucker, Dwight Yoakam, Reba McEntire and Hank Williams Jr. matched 
perennial Grammy favorite Randy Travis with three nominations each. The Judds 
and Alabama join Strait, Williams and Travis in the entertainer of the year 
competition. Winners in the 11 categories will be presented in nationally 
televised ceremonies on NBC from Burbank and Disneyland on April 10. ALEENE

'HARD TIME' NEVER ASCENDS TO ITS SATIRIC POTENTIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Creativity is this season's UFO. There's not enough to fill a flying teacup. 
</P>
<P>
The promising if derivative premise for lighthearted "Hard Time on Planet 
Earth" is subverted in the premiere of the CBS series at 8 tonight on Channels 
2 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
An excessively violent alien is exiled to Earth and can earn his return home 
only by changing his ways. The result? An excessively violent hour of car 
chases and car crashes. Throw in a shooting serenaded by wailing police sirens 
and it's the viewer who ends up doing the hard time. 
</P>
<P>
Given human form, the alien called Jessie (Martin Kove) is accompanied by a 
cybernetic parole officer, a floating, talking, nagging sphere known as 
Control. 
</P>
<P>
Their introduction to Earth is traumatic. Jessie immediately gets himself into 
a mess and is soon in full, panicky, confused flight from the police while 
attempting to rely on his incredible strength (aliens always have incredible 
strength) and language he picks up from watching old movies on TV: "You'll 
never take me alive, copper!" 
</P>
<P>
As Control rushes to the rescue, Jessie also attracts the attention of a 
beautiful and sympathetic geologist (Marita Geraghty). 
</P>
<P>
Created by Jim Thomas and John Thomas (the brothers who wrote "Predator"), 
"Hard Time on Planet Earth" squanders its vast opportunities for humor, in part 
because the role of Jessie demands a touch infinitely lighter than seems 
available from Kove (who was Det. Victor Isbecki on "Cagney &amp; Lacey"). 
</P>
<P>
What really dooms the opening hour, however, is the script by Thomas and 
Thomas, a cloddishly formulaic variation on other variations. Hence, what might 
have been a clever, artful satire instead turns out to be just another show.

SELF-RIGHTEOUS 'PROMISES' LOOKS AT HOMELESS ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Promises to Keep" is advocacy documentary with a capital A. Producer-director 
Ginny Durrin's film about activist Mitch Snyder's battle to create a model 
shelter for the homeless in Washington, D.C., is a strong, one-sided affair, 
near-religious in its moral surety. 
</P>
<P>
"Promises," airing tonight at 9 on Channel 50 and at 10 on Channel 28, follows 
Snyder and the Community for Creative Non-Violence as they battle the federal 
bureaucracy to get funding for a decrepit shelter near the White House, a 
battle that includes sit-ins, hunger strikes, election-year politicking and 
playing the news media. 
</P>
<P>
"Promises," which has been nominated for an Academy Award for best documentary 
feature, is powerful and moving, particularly in its segments with the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
It is nonetheless weakened by an approach that offers little rebuttal from 
federal officials. Perhaps Durrin thought that these officials have enough ammo 
at their disposal, but it is a mistake to include only the more sleazy attacks 
on Snyder -- for example, when a bureaucrat suggests that Snyder has almost a 
Jim Jones cult-like hold on his fellow activists. 
</P>
<P>
The show's "holy crusade" tone also detracts from the promise of "Promises." 
</P>
<P>
Martin Sheen's narration borders on the self-righteous, as does the continual 
use of gospel music and the invocation of God. Part of this can be laid at 
Snyder's feet -- any man who has spent nearly two years fasting for causes 
probably has the right to be holier-than-thou. 
</P>
<P>
God and media smarts -- a one-two punch that couldn't be fended off even by an 
Administration whose leader said "people . . . sleeping on the grates . . . are 
homeless by choice." MARTIN ZIMMERMAN

'SORROWS' SPEAKS OF TIME, PLACE AND INNOCENCE LOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Every time a drama comes along about the travails of growing up, we're reminded 
of "Catcher in the Rye," the great teen-age story that has eluded film makers 
(because author J. D. Salinger won't permit anyone to adapt it). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a quietly evocative dramatization of youthful awakening turns up 
tonight in "Love and Other Sorrows" on PBS' "American Playhouse" (9-10 p.m. on 
Channel 28, 10-11 p.m. on Channel 15). The production is heartfelt, conveying a 
sharp sense of time, place and lost innocence. 
</P>
<P>
The tone and mood are refreshing because the 16-year-old protagonist (portrayed 
with disarming simplicity by Stephen Mailer) is a sweet, floundering, private, 
sensitive kid looking for romantic ideals at a time (1950) just before 
television and rock music changed America. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Goldberg's teleplay, adapted from the short story "First Love and Other 
Sorrows" by Harold Brodkey, nicely captures the first-person viewpoint of the 
endearing hero, not an easy thing to do in film. And director Steven Gomer adds 
to a specific reality by refusing to rush things. He lets the emotional clock 
tick, as in real life. 
</P>
<P>
All the better to re-create the past, the way it was for a youth living with a 
widowed mother (Elizabeth Franz) who pours all her attention into marrying off 
his pretty older sister (Haviland Morris) to a rich beau who can bring the 
family some security. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the thud of love's sorrow falls on the protagonist just at the 
moment of his own first blush of romantic euphoria. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to hear something funny," his sister confides to him. "I really don't 
like my ring." He's stunned to realize his sister is not marrying for love but 
out of pressure and fear. 
</P>
<P>
"Then don't get married," he responds with an open face. Sounds simple to him. 
"You don't understand." She smiles wanly. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, subdued, he sits with his chortling mom and his quiet sister in 
the kitchen to celebrate her wedding date. Fade out and score one for growing 
up. RAY LOYND

The head of East Germany's renowned Meissen porcelain company has defected to 
West Germany, security sources said. The mass-circulation newspapers Bild and 
Hamburg Abendblatt reported that Reinhard Fichte, 47, the director of the 
company founded in 1710, had remained in the West after attending a Frankfurt 
trade fair. Fichte was also a close adviser to Guenter Mittag, an economist and 
member of the East German Communist Party's Politburo, the Hamburg paper 
reported. Security officials confirmed that Fichte had decided to remain in the 
West, but refused to give further details. Fichte was reportedly one of a few 
East German executives allowed to travel freely outside the East Bloc.

37 SRI LANKA VILLAGERS SLAIN

Tamil separatist guerrillas, dressed in military uniforms, went house to house 
in a Sri Lankan village, systematically killing 37 Sinhalese with swords, 
knives and guns, according to survivors and officials. At least 10 children 
were among the victims in Welikande, a village about 100 miles northwest of 
Colombo. Officials said that about 30 rebels attacked the village, hacking and 
slashing people. The guerrillas, suspected members of the Liberation Tigers of 
Tamil Eelam, are fighting for a homeland in northern and eastern areas of the 
Indian Ocean nation.

CURRAN LOSES SUIT IN LOSS OF TEACHING JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Frederick Weisberg rejected 
dissenting theologian Charles E. Curran's suit against Catholic University of 
America, ruling the school was within its rights in barring him from teaching 
theology there. Curran, a priest criticized by Vatican officials for his 
positions on abortion, homosexuality and other matters of sexual ethics, had 
argued in court that the school breached his contract by removing him as a 
teacher of moral theology courses. He said he would not appeal. Curran, who had 
taught at Catholic University since 1965, was suspended in early 1987 and was 
formally told last year that he could not return as a theology teacher. After 
his departure he taught as a visiting professor at Cornell University and is 
currently teaching at USC.

U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau Jr. met with PLO representative Hakem 
Balawi in Tunis, the fifth such meeting since December, when the United States 
agreed to reopen contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization. Although 
the meeting was held at the PLO's request, Pelletreau used the occasion to 
criticize two recent attempts by guerrillas from the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine, a PLO radical faction, to carry out attacks inside 
Israel, a State Department spokesman said. Both attempts failed when Israeli 
troops intercepted the raiders inside Lebanon. The PLO had agreed to renounce 
terrorism, leading to the U.S. decision to reopen talks.

A Boeing 747 cargo door suspected of popping open during a United Airlines 
flight and hurling nine passengers to their deaths had a recent history of 
problems, investigators say. The forward cargo door on the 18-year-old 747 that 
ripped open at 22,000 feet Friday after leaving Honolulu for Auckland, New 
Zealand, had electrical problems more than once in December and had to be 
closed manually, Lee V. Dickinson, investigator for the National Transportation 
Safety Board, said at a news briefing in Honolulu. A seal on the same door was 
repaired in January, he said. United spokesman Rob Doughty said the electrical 
problems are not considered serious and were on a list of deferred items that 
do not affect the airworthiness of the plane.

<P>
The drive to rid California of military-style assault guns favored by street 
gangs, drug traffickers and other criminals scored a pair of important 
victories in the Legislature on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
First, to a round of loud applause from members of Los Angeles neighborhood 
organizations, the Assembly Public Safety Committee approved, with no votes to 
spare, a bill to outlaw the manufacture, sale and possession of certain 
rapid-firing semiautomatic assault guns. 
</P>
<P>
Four hours later, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a broader measure, 
again by a thin margin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Amended in Assembly 
</P>
<P>
Pro-gun lobbyists argued that both bills were misdirected at guns rather than 
at criminals and that it could make lawbreakers of law-abiding gun enthusiasts 
who had legally purchased semiautomatic combat rifles. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly bill was substantially amended to narrow its scope in order to 
gain the necessary favorable votes. 
</P>
<P>
Amid tightened security, upwards of 400 people, many of whom traveled overnight 
by bus from Los Angeles, packed the Capitol's two biggest hearing rooms. 
Spectators were directed through an airport-style metal detector before being 
admitted to the Judiciary Committee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
A Senate official who asked not to be identified said the extra security 
precautions were ordered because "some (Senate) members received threats, both 
written and by telephone." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Assembly author of the legislation, Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), was 
forced to subtantially amend his bill to win approval of the Public Safety 
Committee, he hailed the vote as a major victory for public safety and a loss 
for the politically potent gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still a very strong bill," Roos declared. He forecast a "close vote" on 
the Assembly floor after the measure clears the Ways and Means Committee, its 
next stop. 
</P>
<P>
Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) carried a virtually identical 
bill, but managed to steer it through the Judiciary Committee without making 
major changes. The vote was 6 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day, day in and day out, week in and week out, month in and month out, 
people are being killed in California (by assault guns)," Roberti argued. "It's 
a shame that we have become so hardened to these killings that we are not even 
shocked any more." 
</P>
<P>
Both bills still face an uphill battle in a Legislature that traditionally has 
been reluctant to establish restrictions on guns. Conceivably, a final 
compromise program will be written by a Senate-Assembly conference committee 
sometime this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The California hearings were being closely monitored throughout the country as 
a test of strength of gun lobbies and of organizations opposed to assault 
rifles. 
</P>
<P>
Roos opened the Public Safety Committee hearing by playing an audio tape of 
semiautomatic gun fire. Was it Beirut, Vietnam or Rambo Part V? he asked 
rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
"No," he said. "It was downtown Los Angeles last New Year's Eve. We must put a 
stop to this lunacy." 
</P>
<P>
The two bills, drafted by a task force of law enforcement officers headed by 
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, originally set out to ban a wide range of 
high-powered, rapid-firing military rifles, including the Uzi, AK-47 and AR-15. 
</P>
<P>
However, the National Rifle Assn. and other gun owner groups insisted that no 
clear distinction could be drawn between those weapons and "legitimate" hunting 
and sport firearms. The NRA mounted a massive lobbying campaign among its 
250,000 California members to defeat the bills. 
</P>
<P>
Semiautomatic rifles and shotguns can be purchased over the counter in the 
state by anyone 18 or older who displays standard identification. The potential 
purchaser of a handgun, however, must wait at least 15 days before taking 
possession of the firearm while the state conducts a criminal background check. 
</P>
<P>
The murder of five children on a Stockton schoolyard Jan. 17 and the wounding 
of 29 others and a teacher by a demented gunman, Patrick Purdy, who was armed 
with an AK-47, ignited a groundswell of public opposition to semiautomatic 
assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"Military assault weapons were designed for mass murder and they are excellent 
at it," testified Van de Kamp, a 1990 Democratic gubernatorial contender. "They 
kill kids and they kill cops. They do not belong in the hands of any civilian 
in the state." 
</P>
<P>
Holding a blackjack, billy club and a pair of nunchaku fighting sticks, Van de 
Kamp noted that a gang member would be arrested for possessing any such illegal 
weapons. But hefting an AK-47, he told the committee, "If that same gang member 
walks by carrying an AK-47, there is nothing we can do. He walks on by." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush (R-Saratoga), the target for more than a 
week of intense lobbying by both sides who had opposed the Roos bill, provided 
the crucial fifth vote in the Public Safety Committee to approve the measure. 
</P>
<P>
As the 5-3 vote was announced, the audience, including members of the South 
Central Organizing Committee, East Valley Organization and United Neighborhood 
Organization in Los Angeles, burst into enthusiastic applause. 
</P>
<P>
The action followed acceptance by Roos of amendments proposed by Quackenbush 
that eliminated a broad definition of what constituted an assault rifle. 
Substituted in its place was a list of about 40 rifles, shotguns and pistols 
that would be specifically banned by manufacturer and model, including the 
AK-47 and Uzi. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Roos unsuccessfully carried legislation that specifically would have 
banned nine semiautomatic guns by brand name and model. Tuesday's votes 
presumably indicated a new climate in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The Quackenbush amendments also eliminated a proposed commission that would 
have been empowered to approve for sale and use in California new semiautomatic 
guns as they were developed. Critics had charged that the Legislature should 
make such decisions and not delegate it to an "unaccountable" commission. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp argued against writing into law specific guns to be banned, warning 
that manufacturers could get around the prohibition merely by renaming the 
firearm or making simple cosmetic changes in the weapon's design. 
</P>
<P>
As approved by the Senate committee, Roberti's bill retains the broad 
definition of an assault rifle and keeps intact the assault rifle commission 
that was stripped from the Assembly bill. 
</P>
<P>
In a low-key presentation to both committees, the NRA and the California Rifle 
and Pistol Assn. offered only three witnesses. They argued, basically, that gun 
abusers are criminals and should be toughly dealt with as criminals but that it 
is "misguided" to ban assault guns. 
</P>
<P>
Gun lobbyist Kent L. DeChambeau contended that when a crime occurs with a 
firearm, it does not matter whether the weapon is an assault type. "It's an 
improper use of a firearm. We must get off this idea that we can cure the 
problem by legislating or banning the device (gun)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He drew support from Sen. John Doolittle (R-Rocklin), who termed the bill "sort 
of a Ban the Bomb approach applied to assault rifles. . . . There's many 
Patrick Purdys out there, unfortunately. I don't see this bill dealing with the 
overall problem in this society."

SPECIAL SALES LOSE FAVOR; 
</P>
<P>
SEARS JOINING REVOLUTION OF STABLE PRICING POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
When Sears' 824 stores across the nation reopen today after 42 hours of 
frenzied price cutting by bleary-eyed workers, they will be foot soldiers in a 
spreading revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Heeding customers' cries for stable prices, chain retailers such as Sears, 
Montgomery Ward and K mart have marked down thousands of items and are touting 
"everyday low prices" and low-price guarantees. And other chains, notably 
Target Stores, are also testing the idea of bringing in customers with 
dependable prices instead of relying on frequent special sales. 
</P>
<P>
At least for the time being, the shift in pricing philosophy could mean a field 
day for shoppers who have long suspected retailers of inflating "regular" 
prices and have wearied of waiting for items to go on sale. 
</P>
<P>
"Many shoppers who are busy . . . show no inclination to sit and look at the 
newspaper and wait for a particular item to be on sale," said Bernard Sosnick, 
a retail industry analyst with Deutsche Bank Capital, a New York investment 
firm. "You want to go to a store, know that an item is at a fair low price and 
buy it. It's an imposition to say you have to buy it (on sale) on the third 
Saturday in March." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for this revolution in pricing traces to changing 
demographics and life styles. As women have entered the work force in record 
numbers, they have had to discard the notion of shopping around for the best 
deals. At the same time, escalating prices have prompted a search for value and 
dependability. 
</P>
<P>
But with a constant cycle of one-day sales and high regular prices, chain 
retailers have frustrated shoppers and fostered a high level of skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers are very cynical about the retail pricing structure," said Carol 
Farmer, a New York retail consultant. "Customers really think retailers mark 
prices up to mark them down." 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, stores have simply increased their prices -- between sales, that 
is -- to cover escalating costs of doing business. But that sort of cycle of 
sales and high regular prices has proven self-destructive to retailers, which 
must bear higher costs for advertising and for keeping extra inventory of sale 
items. Moreover, marking down items often hurts sales of similar products 
offering higher profit margins, retailers say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Announcement Puts Spotlight on Prices 
</P>
<P>
Sears' announcement last week that it would briefly close its stores to reduce 
prices on more than 50,000 items and introduce more brand-name merchandise has 
put the spotlight on everyday low prices, even though the strategy is hardly 
new. 
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart, an Arkansas-based discount chain with stores in the Midwest and 
Southeast started by the legendary Sam Walton, has for years been thriving in 
small-town America with its low-price strategy. The retailer recently dubbed it 
the "always" program, with the slogan, "Always the low price on the brands you 
trust." 
</P>
<P>
And highly focused specialty outlets such as Toys R Us and Circuit City, a 
consumer electronics merchant, have also become powerhouses by offering 
dependably low prices on brand-name goods, as have the newer wholesale clubs 
such as Price Club and off-price chains. Circuit City goes many competitors one 
better with a policy of refunding a price difference plus 10% of the difference 
if a customer finds a product advertised lower somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Target, a Minneapolis-based discount chain that has had a policy of heavily 
advertising sale items in weekly circulars, began testing a consistent 
low-price strategy last fall in four stores in Knoxville, Tenn., and 
Albuquerque, N.M. "Results have been encouraging, but not conclusive," said 
Gail Dorn, a spokeswoman for the chain, which operates 349 stores, including 96 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
Even K mart, already known for low prices, has recently refocused efforts to 
match or beat competitors' prices with its "very important price" policy. In 
1987, the chain began reviewing a list of 3,000 items every 60 days, including 
popular health, beauty, pharmaceutical and home improvement products, with an 
eye toward reducing any prices found to be lower at competing chains. Early in 
February, the program was expanded to cover 5,300 items, according to 
spokeswoman Barbara Palazzolo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strategy Aims to Arrest Steep Erosion 
</P>
<P>
For Sears, once the country's uncontested retailing leader, the strategy of 
offering brand-name merchandise at lower prices is designed to arrest a steep 
erosion in market share. In recent years, customers who once routinely shopped 
at Sears for private-label clothing, Craftsman tools and Kenmore appliances 
found that they could often get better value and selection on items from toys 
to televisions at other stores, ranging from specialty clothing operations such 
as the Limited to consumer electronics outlets such as Circuit City. 
</P>
<P>
Sears also lost business to off-price chains that offered daily discounts on 
popular brands. 
</P>
<P>
At Marshalls, a fast-growing chain that is the nation's leading off-price 
retailer, brand-name clothing and household items sell for 20% to 60% below 
department store prices. 
</P>
<P>
With the department store strategy of putting items on sale and then going back 
to regular price and then down again for one-day sales, "it's very difficult 
for a customer to really depend on an everyday low price, certainly in a 
department store," said Francis H. Arnone, president and chief executive of 
Marshalls, based in Woburn, Mass. "Our strategy is that we are predictable and 
customers can get the one-day sale price every day." 
</P>
<P>
There is a trade-off, he acknowledged. In exchange for bargains, shoppers 
sacrifice service and continuity of selection in sizes and colors. 
</P>
<P>
But even high-end department and specialty stores that pride themselves on 
service and dependable assortment say price is very much an object, even if the 
policies are more subtle. 
</P>
<P>
Both Nordstrom and Bullock's post signs at registers to inform customers that 
their policy is not to be undersold. 
</P>
<P>
"We follow a very aggressive pricing policy and bring in merchandise at the 
lowest possible price," said Betsy Sanders, a vice president of Nordstrom who 
is based in Santa Ana. The store also sends workers into the field to scout out 
competitors that might be offering the same merchandise at lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
If a shopper claims to have seen a purchased item elsewhere for less, Nordstrom 
refunds the difference -- no questions asked. "We take the customer's word," 
Sanders said, adding that the store generally finds in its own follow-up 
research with competitors that customers tell the truth. 
</P>
<P>
At Bullock's, a division of R.H. Macy &amp; Co., the policy is to refund the 
difference after first verifying the lower price with the competitor. 
</P>
<P>
Sears' strategy shift seems to appeal to its customers. Dennis Cooper, a 
retired General Motors worker shopping at the Glendale store before it closed 
Monday, sees "the new discount pricing as more of an incentive, rather than 
relying on a sale." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to wait six months and count on having what I'm looking for go on 
sale. How would you feel if you bought a chair for $599" then came in later and 
saw it on sale for $299. "You'd think, 'I've been had.' " 
</P>
<P>
But shoppers who get a kick out of sales need not fear that the big push toward 
everyday low pricing spells the end of periodic markdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, there will be certain times of year where sales are entirely 
appropriate, such as after Easter, after Christmas and fall clearances," said 
Michael Bozic, chairman and chief executive of Sears' merchandising group. "But 
basically we're saying to our customers that what you paid is more important 
than what you're told you saved." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago-based Montgomery Ward, which beat its cross-town rival Sears to the 
low-price punch by reducing prices on thousands of popular name brands last 
year, also expects to continue sales to instill a sense of urgency in 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consumer Still Expects Some Sales 
</P>
<P>
"Our research indicates that, even with everyday low prices, the consumer still 
expects to see some sales," said Chairman Bernard F. Brennan. "You can't 
reprice your entire store and go to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
And May Co. California, a department store chain, figures it must maintain a 
lively schedule of one-day and other sales events to stay competitive. "We try 
to be very promotional with some category of merchandise or other . . . almost 
all the time," said Chairman Edgar S. Mangiafico. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Sears is finding that competitors are responding quickly to its new 
pricing program. "The retail community has decided not to give Sears an inch," 
said Walter F. Loeb, an analyst with the New York investment house of Morgan 
Stanley &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Given its somewhat tattered reputation, observers said, Sears will have to work 
hard to rebuild its constituency. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole issue of credibility makes it much more difficult for a business to 
engage in an everyday low price strategy, particularly one that's going away 
from a strategy based upon promotion," said Carl Steidtmann, vice president and 
chief economist for Management Horizons, a consulting firm in Columbus, Ohio. 
"I think it takes a lot of trust."

CATHOLIC CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
FLOCK RUNS SHORT OF SHEPHERDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Each year the gap widens: Fewer priests are available to serve an increasing 
number of Roman Catholics in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1966, the number of men in seminaries seeking the priesthood has 
plummeted from 48,000 to 7,500. By the year 2000, according to surveys produced 
for the U.S. Catholic hierarchy, the projected decline from resignations, 
deaths and fewer ordinations will leave only 15,000 active parish priests -- 
about the same number as in 1925 and less than half as many as in 1966 -- to 
serve an estimated 65 million faithful. 
</P>
<P>
At the turn of next century, the average age of these priests is projected to 
be 65. 
</P>
<P>
"The vocation shortage is long-term, not just temporary, and the church is 
powerless to reverse . . . the social pressures causing the downturn," declared 
Dean Hoge, a professor of sociology at the Catholic University of America in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
This shortage of shepherds for a growing flock has already made a sharp impact 
in most dioceses. One in 10 U.S. Catholic parishes has no regular priest. In 
Chicago, the vocations director fears that the present average of two priests 
per parish in the archdiocese will slip to only one by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the shortage, the church is training deacons and lay men and 
women to do tasks formerly reserved for priests. At the same time, the effort 
to find priests is focusing on candidates from the growing Latino and Asian 
Catholic populations. Some dioceses are also using novel recruitment 
approaches, such as advertising for priesthood candidates in national 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the bleak vocations picture, the church has no nationally 
coordinated program to reverse the trend. And there is no movement at the 
Vatican to consider changing the celibacy requirement for priests, which is the 
most frequently cited reason that more men do not pursue the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Social Comfort 
</P>
<P>
A recent Vatican report on college-level seminaries frankly acknowledges that 
"pressures on the family, the attraction of material prosperity and social 
comfort, the sexual revolution and the growth of insecurity, as well as a delay 
in the age of personal career decision-making, have all had their effect." 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
* Within 25 years of their ordination, 42% of all U.S. priests have resigned. 
Younger priests are resigning in greater proportion than older ones. 
</P>
<P>
* One of every six men who were ordained as priests are now married, thus 
eliminating them from priestly service. Of those under age 50, one of every 
three is married. 
</P>
<P>
* Overall, Catholic seminaries are replacing only about 60% of the priests who 
resign, retire, are disabled or die. 
</P>
<P>
Two decades ago, 7,855 men were enrolled in the final four-year-program of the 
nation's Catholic theological seminaries that leads to ordination; today there 
are only 3,826. 
</P>
<P>
"In the pool for the next four years we have less than half the potential that 
we had in 1969," lamented Benedictine Father Adrian Fuerst, a research 
associate at the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, an independent 
Washington-based agency that supplies information to the church's decision 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
In the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, where 1,280 priests serve an estimated 3 
million Catholics, 10 men were ordained last year. This year, only five or six 
will be ordained. The average for the nation's 10 largest archdioceses last 
year was about nine new ordinations each. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had 20 a year, we could come close to holding our own," said Msgr. Edwin 
O'Brien, rector of St. Joseph's Seminary in New York City, where 10 men will be 
ordained in May. 
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of 600 Catholics between the ages of 16 and 21 in the Los 
Angeles Archdiocese revealed that the single greatest obstacle to their 
choosing a religious vocation was the "lifetime commitment to celibacy" 
required to enter the priesthood and religious orders. 
</P>
<P>
"Celibacy is always No. 1, and a permanent commitment to a life style is second 
as the reasons young men don't become priests here," echoed Father Scott 
Donahue, vocations director for the Archdiocese of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the problems in recruiting candidates for the priesthood, Fuerst said, 
there is "no national thrust, no concerted effort by the bishops as a national 
group." 
</P>
<P>
"Although there is concern, the (seminary) enrollments are still declining," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The closest thing to a unified approach is the Called by Name program. Adopted 
in several forms by many dioceses, the program works at the parish level. 
</P>
<P>
Members are asked to identify young people they think might be interested in 
religious vocations and supply their names to the diocesan vocations director, 
who in turn writes the youths asking them to consider a vocation and to attend 
an orientation meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very positive idea," Fuerst said. "It makes others aware of the 
importance of becoming part of the whole recruitment picture." 
</P>
<P>
Some dioceses have their own innovations. In Fargo, N.D., for example, Father 
Valentine Gross has devised an aptitude and interest test to help junior and 
senior high school students decide who might "have a vocation." Other dioceses 
with large Latino or Asian populations concentrate on enlisting seminarians 
from these ethnic constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
Some dioceses are finding it pays to advertise. In Chicago, the vocations 
office has been experimenting with radio spot announcements in Spanish to reach 
the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
The St. John Neumann College Seminary Residence in the Bronx, N.Y. -- which 
arranges for men who are thinking about the priesthood to continue their 
studies at local universities or colleges while supplementing their training in 
seminary classes and in a religious environment -- places ads in major 
publications like Reader's Digest, Newsweek and Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets people thinking," explained O'Brien, the seminary rector, " 'Do I want 
to consider the possibility of the priesthood? If so, at least there's a way to 
go.' " 
</P>
<P>
Candidates for the Roman Catholic priesthood must have a college degree or its 
equivalent and complete four years of graduate theological study at an approved 
Catholic seminary. 
</P>
<P>
Vocations experts say the overall recruitment efforts are too little too late, 
and that it is a losing battle unless Rome changes its policies on who can be a 
priest. 
</P>
<P>
Sociologist Hoge speculates that if priests were given the option to marry, the 
number of candidates would quadruple. In a massive study, he found that 16% of 
college-age Catholic men would be interested in the priesthood if it were not 
for the celibacy requirement. 
</P>
<P>
"It would go up so high, that the church would have to institute quality 
standards. The church could be much more selective," Hoge said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholic Church has decreed since the 4th Century that its priests 
must be celibate, basing the requirement on the fact that Jesus was unmarried, 
upon the words of the Apostle Paul that "an unmarried man can devote himself 
(fully) to the Lord's affairs" (First Corinthians 7:32) and upon church 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
The Code of Canon Law says that "clerics are obliged to observe perfect and 
perpetual continence for the sake of the kingdom of heaven and are therefore 
bound to celibacy . . . a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can 
more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart . . . .(Canon 
277.1)." 
</P>
<P>
Recent polls have shown that about 55% of the priests and 60% of the U.S. 
Catholic laity favor optional celibacy for priests. During the Second Vatican 
Council in the mid-1960s, the late Cardinal Julius Dopfner called for the 
suspension of the laws of celibacy pending an extensive historical analysis of 
their origins, but the recommendation was turned down. The present Pope, John 
Paul II, is well known for his insistence on maintaining tradition in the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting at the Vatican with bishops from western Canada last November, the Pope 
suggested that "the ordained priesthood and the church's love and understanding 
of it are being tested, precisely so that what is essential may be 
strengthened, purified and renewed. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"If we are being brought to our knees, so to speak, by the need for more 
priests, is it not in order that we may understand with greater humility and 
love who the Lord of the harvest truly is?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Katarina Schuth OSF, coordinator of a Lilly Endowment-funded study, 
points to better programs of priestly formation since Vatican II and increasing 
involvement of lay people as ways the church is attempting to solve the 
leadership problem. By training the laity to take on some tasks, the clergy is 
freed to concentrate on sacramental duties, such as saying Mass, that require 
ordination. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Katarina noted that there are currently about 4,000 nuns and lay people 
pursuing graduate degrees in theology in seminaries across the country. Twenty 
years ago, there were none, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But increasing lay enrollment presents its own problems. Many seminaries are 
not yet equipped to handle lay students. The administrations and faculties at 
the institutions have not yet defined the program to be followed by these lay 
men and women. In some cases, students training for the priesthood desire a 
clear delineation between the educational training received by them and their 
lay classmates. 
</P>
<P>
Further, priests are not held in the high esteem they once were, a fact that 
can sometimes be discouraging to the seminarian, Sister Katarina said. If no 
line is drawn between the curriculum followed by those training for the 
priesthood and that followed by lay students of theology, change in attitude 
toward priests is sometimes even more pronounced to seminarians, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Today a person must have a special spark within himself that draws him to the 
priesthood, because the outside support just isn't there," the sister said. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of support experienced by administrators at the seminaries is one reason 
for large turnover in those positions, she added, as well as transitions in 
leadership, which increase the difficult struggles seminaries in this country 
are undergoing. 
</P>
<P>
Still, mandatory celibacy is the major reason for clergy leaving the priesthood 
and for loneliness among those who stay, according to a recent report from a 
committee of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. 
</P>
<P>
"The language used in explaining the call to live a celibate life does not 
speak adequately to many priests today, especially in terms of the contemporary 
culture and society in which priests live out their ministry," the Bishops' 
Committee on Priestly Life and Ministry warned. "Not only must new language be 
found, but ways must be discovered to help priests appropriate this commitment 
within their own lives." 
</P>
<P>
At St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, where priests are trained for service in 
the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, students interviewed for this story frankly 
said it was not easy to decide to give up the possibility of marriage and 
fathering children in order to follow the celibate life expected of priests. 
</P>
<P>
Claude LeBlanc entered St. John's as a first-year theology student last 
September after having previously studied in a Salesian Society seminary in New 
Jersey for five years. But he dropped out after only two months and is now 
teaching at Catholic high schools in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"In the fall of 1987," he said in an interview, "I really decided to take my 
spiritual life more seriously, and that led me to become more willing to do 
what God wanted me to do. . . . I came to the conclusion that I really loved 
what the priests did -- the life style, the sacraments, preaching. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel a definite call to the priesthood, but I felt drawn by God to go 
to St. John's," declared LeBlanc, 29, a graduate of Don Bosco Technical 
Institute in Rosemead. "I decided to spend one year to discern this vocation." 
</P>
<P>
But after two months, LeBlanc had his answer. 
</P>
<P>
"What God called me to was my deepest desires," he concluded, "the things I'd 
longed for all my life . . . being a music composer and having a family." 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc nonetheless still wishes he could be a priest: "I'd prefer to do that 
above anything else. . . . There's where my heart is. But because of the 
church's laws on celibacy, I can't be a priest because I feel called to have a 
family." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not angry," added the Alhambra resident, who plans in August to marry a 
young woman who left a religious lay community last summer. "That's the way it 
is and that's fine with me. 
</P>
<P>
"But if there were married priests in the Catholic Church, I'd be the first in 
line." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Schoenherr, professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin in 
Madison and a colleague of Hoge, has produced definitive studies of the 
vocations problem at the request of the nations' bishops. His newest analysis, 
he said in an interview, confirms his earlier surveys indicating that about 
1,300 U.S. priests resign each year, and about 90% of these marry. 
</P>
<P>
In her analysis for the Lilly-funded study, Sister Katarina identified past 
periods when the number of vocations to the priesthood has been small, but the 
problem was remedied by waves of immigrants to the United States. Many 
immigrants were Catholic and wanted to become priests. 
</P>
<P>
The church cannot expect the present shortage to be corrected in the same way, 
she concluded, because -- except in a few Third World countries -- young men no 
longer see becoming a priest in the United States as a ticket to upward social 
and professional mobility. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, those who enter seminary tend to be older than their predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who are older won't be around as long," researcher Fuerst explained. 
"So, many will give about 10 years less to the priesthood" compared with a 
typical period of service for priests ordained two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
The latest national study of post-college Catholic seminarians shows that 
compared to 1966, when 72% of seminarians were 25 years old or younger, that 
group is now only 36%. And while in 1966 a scant 7% of the students were over 
30, today they make up at least a third of those in the theology program, and 
4% are over 50. 
</P>
<P>
Average age is not the only difference between American seminarians of the late 
1980s and their younger counterparts about 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Seminarians today tend to be more conservative and traditional, desiring to 
stress personal meditation and prayer, administering the sacraments, preaching, 
tending to people's needs and caring for the sick, according to 1987 research 
titled, "Seminary Life and Visions of the Priesthood: A National Survey of 
Seminarians," by sociologist Hoge and Father Eugene Hemrick. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are today's priests as likely as they were in the 1960s to engage in social 
action addressing poverty, racism, sexism and injustice. This category scored 
the lowest of roles identified with the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, concluded a section of the Bishops' Committee on Priestly Life and 
Ministry report, "Reflections on the Morale of Priests," "The continuing 
shortage of clergy casts its shadow on both present ministry and future hopes. 
Official directives which focus on duties 'only the priest can do' tend to 
increase the workload and make for less effective ministry. The lack of a 
unified, coherent vision of what we are all about is an additional burden. . .

ARTWORK'S SHADOWS TO BE CAST ON 2 CONTINENTS

</HEADLINE>

<P>
To wintertime motorists, the Grapevine can sometimes be as inviting as a drive 
on a frozen lake bed. In the summer, it can become an obstacle course of 
overheated cars that never reach the top. 
</P>
<P>
But Christo is coming, and he just might change the Grapevine's sorry 
reputation. And he is bringing giant yellow umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes according to plan, 1,700 octagonal umbrellas, each 28 feet in 
diameter, will cascade down both sides of Interstate 5 for 18 miles from Gorman 
to the bottom of the Grapevine in October, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time half way around the world, 1,300 blue umbrellas will sprout in 
rice paddies, a bamboo forest, a riverbed, villages and farmers' back yards 
along a 12-mile rural stretch of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Christo's three-week spectacle is expected to attract hundreds of thousands of 
art lovers on both sides of the Pacific as well as plenty of rubberneckers 
along the busiest north-south artery in California. 
</P>
<P>
The prospects have already prompted California Highway Patrol officials to 
begin planning for what they say will be its biggest traffic challenge since 
the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Enchanting, Uplifting' 
</P>
<P>
But why 300-pound umbrellas? 
</P>
<P>
"The umbrella is something extremely familiar to everyone around the world," 
the Bulgarian-born artist said. "It's so enchanting, so uplifting. It has a 
fabulous connotation. The umbrella is very much linked to the greatness of 
kings." 
</P>
<P>
The luminescent umbrellas, Christo predicted, will resemble houses without 
walls and will convey the image of "nomadic tribes when they build their 
tents." 
</P>
<P>
Christo, a slight, bespectacled man with a Continental accent and a disarmingly 
courteous manner, has been very much linked to controversy in the past. Not 
content to confine his work to museum walls, Christo has presented -- some 
would say foisted -- his huge outdoor artworks in public places where people 
could not help seeing them. 
</P>
<P>
He shrouded the oldest bridge in Paris in champagne-colored fabric. He 
gift-wrapped the tiny Florida islands dotting Biscayne Bay in hot pink woven 
polypropylene. He drew a giant billowing curtain across a valley near Rifle, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Some local artists apparently envisioned his only other California project, the 
"Running Fence," the way Southerners viewed Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's 
Civil War march to the sea. They complained that the fence and its carloads of 
sightseers would create environmental havoc. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the protest, Christo in 1976 defiantly erected a shimmering cloth fence 
that stretched across 24 1/2 miles of tawny fields in Marin and Sonoma counties 
before plunging into the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the construction, Christo hid in a eucalyptus grove after 
mistakeningly believing that the state attorney general wanted to serve him 
with an injunction to unravel the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people think I'm a lunatic to do these projects," Christo conceded in an 
interview. But he explained that creating three-dimensional art under the open 
sky where space is unlimited frees him from the constraints of museums that, he 
sniffed, were invented only 250 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
And this time around, it appears his art will be better received. 
</P>
<P>
Christo has been quietly spending 2 1/2 years laying the groundwork for his 
umbrella project. As head cheerleader, the 53-year-old Christo has flown to 
Japan 33 times and visited the West Coast on almost as many occasions. He has 
brought videotapes, slide shows, photographs, books and magazine articles to 
attest to his sincerity and legitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
"We listen to advice, and we move very cautiously to develop a relationship 
with the owners of the land," Christo said. 
</P>
<P>
He used the same strategy to educate wary landowners in Japan and public 
officials and disbelieving ranchers in California who live in the shadows of 
the Grapevine's imposing hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anyone wildly ecstatic about it, and some think it's plain 
foolish," said Robert Preston, a general contractor who is letting Christo 
erect umbrellas on his property in the Tejon Pass. "I fit into the middle 
ground. I sort of like to see things like this happen." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Excited About It' 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a traffic nightmare, but it will be a thing of absolute beauty. . . 
. We're really excited about it," said Capt. Patrick Harrington, head of the 
CHP's legislative unit. He was assigned to the project after the state 
Legislature thanked the artist in 1987 for picking California for his next 
international art event. 
</P>
<P>
It took 9,000 miles of traveling by car before Christo selected the two sites 
for the project he first envisioned in 1984. In both countries, he had searched 
for a serene valley, unfettered by tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Christo, who does not use his last name of Javacheff, said he chose California 
because of its strong link to the Pacific Rim. Wanting sunny weather for the 
autumn display, he narrowed his site to Southern California and began his 
search in the summer of 1986 in the San Diego area. But he was disappointed by 
the urban buildup between San Diego and Los Angeles and headed north. 
</P>
<P>
He found what he was looking for in the Grapevine (named long ago for the wild 
grapes that appeared there), which he said Japanese visitors will find 
"mind-boggling." The contrast between the San Joaquin Valley's endless horizon 
at the edge of the Grapevine and the very cramped landscape of Japan will be 
like a "symphony in two parts," Christo said. 
</P>
<P>
The artist hopes to deliver the outdoor extravaganza for $10 million to $12 
million. Christo's California project director, Tom Golden, a Sonoma County 
landmarks commissioner who has worked with the artist since the "Running 
Fence," said he thinks the artist could end up spending $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
All the money will come from Christo. As in the past a corporation formed by 
him and his wife, Jeanne-Claude, will sell hundreds of drawings, collages and 
plans from his umbrella preparations and past and future projects to 
collectors, art dealers and museums. Christo has never made a profit on his 
outdoor art and has never wanted to, said Jeanne-Claude, who handles the 
couple's financial dealings. If the money runs out, she said, she obtains a 
bank loan. 
</P>
<P>
"Christo doesn't have a house in the Hamptons or Santa Barbara, and I don't 
have diamonds," said Jeanne-Claude Christo, who has lived with her husband for 
25 years in a fourth-floor walk-up in a graffiti-marred building in the Soho 
District of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Most Complicated' Work 
</P>
<P>
Christo, who said he spends at least 18 hours a day on the umbrella project, 
called his latest venture -- the first undertaken at two sites simultaneously 
-- probably his "most complicated" work. 
</P>
<P>
In California, a battalion of bureaucrats must sign off on the project from Los 
Angeles and Kern counties, the state Department of Transportation, the state 
Department of Parks and Recreation, the CHP and other agencies. All have 
expressed enthusiasm for the project. There also were 42 persons who have title 
to the desolate property hugging the Grapevine who had to be convinced of the 
endeavor's worthiness. 
</P>
<P>
For a year, the biggest holdout was the Tejon Ranch Co., which owns 40% to 50% 
of the land on the umbrella trail. Golden said the smaller property owners kept 
telling him that if he got Tejon Ranch's blessing, the rest would acquiesce. 
</P>
<P>
After Tejon conducted an exhaustive background check on the artist and his 
larger-than-life works, permission came from its board of directors late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"I must say I've been very impressed with what I've seen," said Dennis 
McCarthy, Tejon Ranch's general counsel and senior vice president who noted 
that the ranch's cattle probably will enjoy using the umbrellas as scratching 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
The sales job in Japan proved more daunting. 
</P>
<P>
Simply locating the 437 property holders in the umbrellas' proposed path 
required detective work. The Japanese pay no taxes on land, which made it 
impossible to easily track down owners and the most recent property maps were 
drawn in the 1920s. What's more, land ownership is considered a private matter, 
not the sort of thing an inquisitive foreigner should be asking about. 
</P>
<P>
About every half mile, Christo hired an elderly man to make discreet inquiries. 
It worked. The artist is confident that he will obtain written permission from 
the landowners in the province of Ibaraki. Meanwhile, he added, the Japanese 
government wants to make it a "national project." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Set Up Camp at Motel 
</P>
<P>
The artist and his entourage set up camp in Gorman's only motel last September. 
Christo said the group hiked for weeks selecting the site. Stakes marked each 
umbrella's site and, as a precaution against curious cattle, a magnet the size 
of an aspirin was buried to mark each spot. 
</P>
<P>
Each collapsible nylon umbrella will stand 19 feet, 8 inches tall with a 
diameter of 28 feet 5 inches. Every base probably will contain 1,500 pounds of 
sandbags. If the winds reach 50 m.p.h., the umbrellas will be closed. 
</P>
<P>
No one has been selected to manufacture the umbrellas, but companies from 
Bakersfield, Salina, Kan., Germany and Japan submitted prototypes. The 
umbrellas were tested for wind worthiness last May in Cheyenne, Wyo., one of 
the nation's most blustery spots. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists at Iowa State University are building a scale model to undergo 
engineering studies. The test site will then shift to the Silicon Valley where 
one or more life-size prototypes will be subjected to a NASA wind tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
Christo expects that it will take less than a week to position the umbrellas 
and up to 10 days to dismantle them. On each side of the Pacific, 1,000 people 
will be hired to install the umbrellas and then serve as caretakers and tour 
guides. Visitors will be allowed to walk among the umbrellas that are on public 
property and touch them. 
</P>
<P>
When the show is over, Christo expects to recycle his umbrellas. After the 
"Running Fence," he donated the poles to ranchers for cattle guards and the 
fabric became hay bale covers. The material covering the Paris bridge was given 
to a U.N. relief fund and served as lining for mud houses in Afghan refugee 
camps in Pakistan.

'RED EYE' CALLED AIR CONDUIT FOR ALIENS; 69 MORE ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. immigration officials continued their crackdown on transcontinental 
alien-smuggling schemes that use a "red-eye" flight that departs daily from Los 
Angeles International Airport, arresting 69 illegal immigrants Monday night as 
they tried to board a New York-bound jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
Among those apprehended, officials said Tuesday, was a 42-year-old suspected 
smuggler, who authorities say may lead them to others involved in the 
sophisticated smuggling operations. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, 79 illegals, also bound for New York, were arrested at 
Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport when the flight the smugglers were 
using -- Eastern Airlines Flight 80 -- arrived there for refueling. Authorities 
said the arrests resulted from tips in Atlanta and Los Angeles that coyotes, as 
the smugglers are commonly called, had been using that flight to ferry 
thousands of aliens across the country from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the arrest of Jorge Guzman-Romero on smuggling charges, Immigration and 
Naturalization Service officials in Los Angeles conceded Tuesday that they were 
not making much progress in capturing the masterminds behind the smuggling 
aboard the Eastern flight. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not as close as we'd like to be," said Thomas Gaines, the local head of 
the INS' anti-smuggling unit. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines said he believes that the use of Flight 80 may involve many smugglers 
who are not working together. "We feel like we have a number of individual 
smugglers who are utilizing a rather low air fare to move their aliens away 
from the border from Los Angeles and on up to the East Coast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Looney, assistant director of the INS Los Angeles district, said alien 
smuggling aboard commercial jetliners is not new, noting that the practice has 
been occurring "as long as there's been airplanes." 
</P>
<P>
As in the Atlanta arrests, Eastern officials cooperated with the INS and the 
airline is not involved in the smuggling, Looney said. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines and Looney offered few details at a Los Angeles news conference about 
specifics of how the scheme worked, the location of safe houses used by the 
smugglers or when other arrests might be made, saying they do not want to 
jeopardize the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
However, based on interviews with the aliens captured at Los Angeles, INS 
officials concluded that the smugglers have set up a system that transports 
aliens from Mexico City to Tijuana and then across the border to San Diego. 
There, a safe house was occasionally used for aliens waiting for the trip to 
Los Angeles and Eastern Flight 80. 
</P>
<P>
The aliens captured at the Los Angeles airport said they paid smugglers an 
average of $800 for the trip to New York. Some of the aliens captured in 
Atlanta said they had paid as much as $4,000 for a package deal, including air 
fare, meals, housing and a job in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Of those arrested, 54 were from Mexico, seven from El Salvador, four from 
Colombia and four from Guatemala. The Mexicans were bused to the border at San 
Ysidro; the others were being held for probable deportation today. 
</P>
<P>
An affidavit filed in support of Guzman-Romero's arrest said he accompanied 
three Mexicans all the way from Mexico City. In one instance, Guzman-Romero 
went to a small village in central Mexico and recruited a woman for the trip, 
according to an affidavit by INS agent Anna Marie Morones. 
</P>
<P>
Some aliens were told to pay more money once they arrived in New York and other 
cities in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
One veteran INS investigator, who asked that his name not be used, said Monday 
night's apprehensions went smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
"After the arrests went down in Atlanta, it was easy enough for us to go the 
next night to LAX, figure out where Flight 80 was boarding and round the people 
up," the agent said. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines said 11 of the aliens were arrested as they waited at the gate for 
Flight 80. The rest were rounded up as they tried to enter Terminal 6, where 
Eastern is located. 
</P>
<P>
Guzman-Romero, a native of the Mexican state of Puebla, was arrested in a 
waiting room. He was ordered jailed late Tuesday by U.S. Magistrate Volney 
Brown on three counts of knowingly transporting and moving aliens within the 
United States.

'COYOTE BUSTERS' PUSH STRONGER U.S. EFFORT TO CONTROL SMUGGLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The sweeping arrests this week of suspected illegal immigrants in Atlanta and 
Los Angeles represent a stepped-up government effort to stem the growing 
incidence of alien-smuggling, federal officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with countless smugglers, called coyotes, whose sophisticated operations 
charge thousands of dollars to transport people from Latin America to this 
country, the Immigration and Naturalization Service is fighting back with a 
crack unit of 300 special agents called, "Coyote Busters." 
</P>
<P>
The effort, which often includes agents from the Drug Enforcement 
Administration, the FBI and other federal agencies, is producing an unusual 
amount of agreement between the INS and its usually harsh critics among 
immigrant rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Moreno, associate counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, said, "We welcome any sort of effort to break up any 
smuggling ring. They gouge the people they bring over." 
</P>
<P>
Cecilia Munoz, of the National Council of La Raza, observed: "Any effort to 
control the border should include the attempt to control individuals who 
exploit potential border-crossers." 
</P>
<P>
Officially members of the anti-smuggling unit of INS, many of the agents work 
undercover in jobs such as drivers and guides. They often risk their lives -- 
at times even operating "drop houses" or getting themselves sold to 
unscrupulous labor contractors, INS officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the stuff these agents do is hair-raising," said Bob O'Leary, senior 
special agent of the INS unit, which was formed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
It found its mission increasingly difficult as waves of Central Americans began 
pouring into this country in the 1980s. And with passage of the 1986 
Immigration Reform and Control Act, illegal immigrants find it more and more 
difficult to live and work underground without smugglers and their cohorts to 
provide them with fake documents. 
</P>
<P>
"We're coming into a whole new generation" of smugglers and immigrants, said 
O'Leary. "We have to send a message that smuggling will not be tolerated. One 
of our goals is to protect those who get ripped off, murdered and raped by 
unscrupulous smugglers near our borders." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Growing Problem 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrating the magnitude of the problem, agents in 1988 apprehended 13,200 
smugglers and 28,108 smuggled immigrants, seizing 9,677 vehicles worth $27.7 
million. In 1988, 1,121 smugglers were convicted of felonies; 4,868 were 
convicted of misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
In two operations this week, the INS arrested 148 suspected illegal immigrants 
from Mexico and other Latin American countries. One suspected smuggler also was 
arrested. Some of the immigrants said they paid as much as $4,000 to smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
While many immigrants pay high prices to enter the United States, the costs to 
others are even more dear. Some die in locked boxcars or on desert marches, 
while others are held hostage because relatives do not pay up, INS officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally have been involved in cases where aliens were robbed at gunpoint 
in a garage," said Ron Smith, an INS official at the Western Region 
headquarters in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
The two cities where arrests were made this week -- Atlanta and Los Angeles -- 
graphically show the nationwide range of smuggling rings. Their tactics vary, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no limitation to the methods smugglers use," Smith said. "They use 
Amtrak, trucks, gas tanks in cars. We've even had reports that they (have) used 
small submarines." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said smugglers increasingly include drugs and semiautomatic weapons 
in their activities. "They are diversifying," one official noted. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials said they face an increasing number of high-speed chases, 
which often endanger innocent bystanders. INS officials said it is partly out 
of this concern that they are planning to build a controversial 14-foot, 
$2-million ditch along the border near San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The smugglers are not all from Latin America. In fact, said one Justice 
Department official, "The most difficult and sophisticated group" is based in 
China, using Hong Kong as a staging area. "Their network extends worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the smugglers are specializing more than before, said INS 
officials. In the past, one network would recruit immigrants, select a staging 
area, guide and deliver the immigrants across the U.S. border. "As of late," 
said one official, "many smugglers have become so specialized that they perform 
only one of these functions." 
</P>
<P>
Training Coyote Busters is specialized as well. Agents compete to be accepted 
in the unit, and then are sent to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center 
in Glynco, Ga., for three weeks of intensive training. They learn how to 
identify smugglers, penetrate organizations and recruit informants. 
</P>
<P>
The 300 agents are based around the nation, with heavy concentrations in 
California, Texas, New York and Chicago, favorite destinations for illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The unit boasts that while it represents only 4% of the total INS force, it 
accounts for 36% of the felony convictions and 37% of the agency's conspiracy 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Among its recent successes, the unit cites Operation Boxcar, a four-month 
effort that netted 3,200 Latin American immigrants and 87 suspected smugglers 
in locked railroad cars. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Shorty involved an international organization smuggling Guatemalan 
Indians to farm labor contractors throughout the United States, where they 
lived in "utterly squalid conditions," INS documents report. After a yearlong 
investigation using undercover drivers, labor contractors and agents posing as 
immigrants, a federal task force arrested 110 suspected smugglers and 5,000 
immigrants, who were returned to Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these victories, federal officials acknowledge that the war against 
smuggling is far from over. Many federal officials liken their struggle to the 
drug war, with more and more people getting into the mix. 
</P>
<P>
Is the federal government winning or losing? One Justice Department official 
said that, like those waging the war on illegal drugs, "Even if you don't feel 
like you're winning, you have to keep fighting."

GORBACHEV AIDE ACCUSES WEST OF DRAGGING FEET ON IMPROVING TIES

A top aide to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in remarks clearly aimed 
primarily at the United States, has accused the West of dragging its feet on 
improving relations with the Soviet Bloc, Pravda reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander N. Yakovlev, speaking a week before the first formal high-level 
contacts between the Kremlin and the Bush Administration, said "Cold War" 
attitudes still influence Western leaders in their attitudes to the East. 
</P>
<P>
"Official political thinking in the West continues to make use of the concepts 
of hostility and confrontation," Yakovlev, a member of the Communist Party's 
ruling Politburo, told a meeting in Tbilisi, Georgia, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Movement in Western thinking is only just beginning. It is a long way from 
full understanding that the policy of military strength has no future, and even 
more from rejecting it." 
</P>
<P>
Yakovlev, 65, has a strong influence on formulation of foreign policy and is 
widely regarded as one of the most radical reformers in the Kremlin leadership, 
although he has a long record as a bitter critic of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
His remarks indicated growing concern in Moscow over the Bush Administration's 
position on bilateral relations. 
</P>
<P>
He said trade restrictions against the Soviet Union and its East Bloc allies 
and "unceasing talk" about the modernization of weaponry appeal to those 
reluctant to respond to Soviet initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this not all the heritage of the Cold War, a desire not to move fast in 
reducing tension?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
There seemed little doubt that his list of concerns formed part of the 
background agenda for next week's Vienna meeting between Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caution on Trade 
</P>
<P>
Baker has urged caution on any slackening of Western rules on technology 
transfers to the East and strongly championed updating of North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization nuclear weaponry in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has also insisted it will not move quickly toward 
negotiating new agreements with Moscow on arms reductions or other areas of the 
superpower relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Yakovlev said that despite the problems he outlined, there is a growing 
recognition in the West that confrontation and the accumulation of nuclear 
weaponry have led mankind into a blind alley. 
</P>
<P>
The response from Moscow in the present situation, he said, "should not be in 
favor of continuing a confrontational approach" but in persisting with 
Gorbachev's "new thinking."

BRITISH CATHEDRAL DROPS ITS PLAN TO SELL MEDIEVAL MAP

Hereford Cathedral dropped plans Tuesday to sell a unique 13th-Century map 
regarded as one of Britain's greatest medieval treasures. 
</P>
<P>
The cathedral provoked protests in November when it said it would auction the 
Mappa Mundi to avoid bankruptcy, raising fears that other cash-strapped British 
institutions might also sell their treasures to balance the books. 
</P>
<P>
Critics were concerned that Britain would lose part of its medieval heritage if 
the map was sold to a foreign bidder. 
</P>
<P>
Cathedral officials said Tuesday that Hereford was working out a deal to save 
the map and was confident that the sale, scheduled to be held at Sotheby's 
auction house in June, would not go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The Mappa Mundi, drawn on a single piece of vellum 64 by 54 inches and covered 
in gold leaf, depicts a circular world with Jerusalem at its center, the Garden 
of Eden at the top and Britain at the edge. 
</P>
<P>
Church official Leonard Moss said the cathedral is still negotiating to raise 
$12.2 million to clear its debts and carry out repairs and new building work.

JARUZELSKI WARNS OF CRACKDOWN ON POLISH 'FESTIVAL OF STRIKES'

<TEXT>
<P>
Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski declared Tuesday that the country's situation 
has been "dangerously worsened by a festival of strikes and protests" and he 
warned that the army is prepared to ensure that the country "will not be pushed 
from socialism's road." 
</P>
<P>
The tough speech to a meeting of military officers, delivered in Bydgoszcz on 
Monday and prominently reported in the state press Tuesday, came after violent 
demonstrations by students in Krakow last week and appeared designed to 
reassure the party's security apparatus as well as to remind Poles of the 1981 
imposition of martial law. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to "doubts and questions over the future of Poland, her secure, safe 
socialist development," Gen. Jaruzelski declared that deviation from this 
course "is out of the question." He added that "the fact that I state this just 
at this place and just at this time" in a military gathering "will also be a 
warning." 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski praised a "round table" of negotiations between the opposition and 
government that, entering its fourth week, appears to have made significant 
progress toward a broad political pact that would legalize the outlawed 
Solidarity union. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa joined Jaruzelski in pressing for calm during the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa and an estimated 10,000 people marched in the city of Szczecin in 
northwestern Poland on Tuesday in support of the talks, the Reuters news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest turnout for Walesa during his tour of industrial centers to 
try to dampen labor unrest and anti-government protests while the talks on 
Poland's future are in progress. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the student demonstrators, Reuters quoted Walesa as saying: "I beg 
you on my knees . . . let's give the round table (talks) a chance. . . . If 
they fail, then in April or May I will call for a resolute struggle for Poland 
and for reforms." 
</P>
<P>
In commenting on the student demonstrations, Jaruzelski said that he is "an 
advocate of reacting with patience and understanding to the emotions of young 
people. However, there are certain limits and they must not be exceeded." In a 
hint of a coming crackdown against militant students, he added that "the 
ministers of national education and of internal affairs should draw appropriate 
conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski's statement, the most important he has delivered since the onset of 
the round-table talks, coincided with a major government propaganda campaign 
against demonstrations and efforts by opposition groups to prevent new street 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
Students and militant opposition activists have marched in cities around Poland 
in the last two weeks to demand political concessions from the government, 
including legalization of the independent Students' Union, which was banned 
along with Solidarity in 1981. In Krakow last week, students staged a 
demonstration that mocked the Soviet army and violently clashed with police who 
sought to break up a march.

VENEZUELA SUSPENDS RIGHTS AS DOZENS DIE IN RIOTING

government suspended constitutional rights Tuesday and imposed a nationwide 
curfew as riots over price increases ravaged Venezuela for a second day and 
looting spread. 
</P>
<P>
President Carlos Andres Perez appealed on television for an end to the 
"incredible tragedy," which, according to police estimates, has killed up to 50 
people and injured 500. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Perez spoke, gunfire was heard in the streets, and rioting and looting 
continued in the worst violence in 30 years of democratic rule. Authorities 
said thousands were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
In the eastern shantytown of Petare, battles between police and rioters killed 
17 people. Victims were carried down from the hills to major avenues to be 
taken to hospitals while crowds watched, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan Police Inspector Omar Bolivar said the riots were "much worse" 
than Monday. "Rioters are better armed than we are," he said. "They have 
rifles, pistols, revolvers, even submachine guns out there." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Caracas, rioting and looting quickly spread from Caracas to Valencia, 
Barquisimeto, Carora, Puerto La Cruz, San Cristobal and Maracaibo. All of those 
cities were reported to be calm after the curfew went into effect Tuesday 
night. The casualty tolls there were not known. 
</P>
<P>
Civilians and police exchanged gunfire and shop owners took up arms to protect 
their property. The Education Ministry suspended school and university classes 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The curfew was imposed from 8 p.m. Tuesday to 6 a.m. today, and from 6 p.m. 
today to 6 a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Army patrols in Caracas patrolled the empty streets as the curfew went into 
effect. Gunfire and explosions were heard as soldiers and police fought snipers 
and looters in some neighborhoods in west and east Caracas. 
</P>
<P>
The capital looked like a ghost town, with only ambulances and specially 
authorized vehicles operating. Army units stood at strategic downtown corners. 
Rough estimates said up to 10,000 troops may have been mobilized in Caracas. 
</P>
<P>
Among the rights suspended indefinitely by Perez were those allowing public 
gatherings and freedom of expression and placing limits on police searches and 
arrests. The last time such a measure was taken was in the 1960s, when 
Venezuela was plagued by Cuban-backed guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
The unrest exploded Monday after stiff increases in bus fares and gasoline 
prices took effect. The increases were part of an economic package that 
included higher prices for food and basic items. 
</P>
<P>
The price increases, announced two weeks after Perez took office Feb. 2, were 
required by the International Monetary Fund as a condition for granting 
Venezuela $1.5 billion in credit. 
</P>
<P>
For 30 years one of the most politically stable countries in South America, 
Venezuela is now in a deep recession, caused in part by the worldwide decline 
in the price of oil, its major export.

A Japanese man who spent 30 years on death row after being wrongly convicted of 
murdering a 6-year-old girl was awarded nearly $1 million in compensation 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A district court at Shizuoka awarded Masao Akahori, 59, more than $75 for each 
of his 12,668 days in custody, press reports said. 
</P>
<P>
"Speaking frankly, I bear a deep grudge and hatred," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Akahori was arrested in 1954 and apparently forced to confess to the murder 
after three days of police questioning, but it was not until 1958 that he was 
sentenced to death.

$800-MILLION PLAN FOR MAINTAINING, REPAIRING AGING BOEING JETS URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An international task force made up of airlines, aircraft builders and 
government officials issued what some experts said was a landmark call Tuesday 
for costly, rigorous self-policing, recommending an $800-million repair and 
maintenance program to make the world's aging air fleet safe. 
</P>
<P>
The task force was formed as a result of recent air accidents -- not including 
the Boeing 747 jetliner accident in Hawaii last Friday that killed nine -- and 
industry fears of inappropriate government regulatory response. Its first 
report offered recommendations on improving the safety of 1,300 older Boeing 
Co. aircraft still in service. 
</P>
<P>
The group hopes to increase the safety of such planes, which have been involved 
in fatal accidents, by emphasizing their modification or replacement, not 
through increased government inspection, said Clyde Kizer, an Air Transport 
Assn. vice president who is on the 150-member Airworthiness Assurance Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
This approach, he noted, will require rebuilding of lap and bonded joints that 
show signs of loosening and replacing of structural elements, skins and 
fittings, at an estimated cost of $600,000 per aircraft for the older Boeings. 
</P>
<P>
There was no agreement on how the cost would be split between plane builders 
and air carriers, although David Heymsfeld, staff counsel for the House Public 
Works subcommittee on aviation, noted that the expense of complying with 
airworthiness directives normally falls exclusively on the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The costs of complying with the program could be crippling for smaller airlines 
-- those providing commuter services and feeding major carriers. But Heymsfeld 
noted that such lines usually operate with planes smaller than the Boeing 727s, 
737s and 747s, which were covered in the first task force recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Two other teams -- one scrutinizing McDonnell Douglas Corp. planes and another 
examining Lockheed Corp., Airbus, British Aerospace Corp. and Fokker craft -- 
will also issue safety recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
If the task force recommendations are adopted by the Federal Aviation 
Administration, they will be issued as airworthiness directives, with 
compliance mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the FAA -- which has not had a permanent administrator since T. 
Alan McArtor departed on Feb. 17 -- Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. 
Skinner praised the task force's work. He said in a statement that the FAA is 
seeking $10 million in its 1990 budget for research on older aircraft and is 
proposing to hire 400 more safety inspectors and support personnel to 
strengthen its surveillance of older planes. 
</P>
<P>
The task force was organized last June by the air transport group and the 
Aerospace Industry Assn. and comprises representatives of the FAA, other U.S. 
agencies and foreign governments.

SOME SUITS AGAINST MUNICIPALITIES OKD 
</P>

<P>
The Supreme Court opened the door slightly Tuesday to permit suits against a 
local government whose policies and actions reflect a "deliberate indifference" 
to the rights of its citizens and result in their harm or injury. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, stemming from a jailhouse incident in Canton, Ohio, helps to 
clarify what had been a muddled area of law in cases such as alleged police 
brutality. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the high court first ruled that a city or county may be sued in 
federal court if it had a "policy" that resulted in the violation of a 
citizen's constitutional rights. But, since then, justices have not made clear 
what citizens had to show to prove such policies existed. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous ruling announced Tuesday, attorneys in the case said, appears to 
allow some suits to proceed to trial, although it may make it difficult for 
citizens to win them. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court, cited an example of how the new 
rule might work. If a city gives guns to its police officers but fails to train 
them in their use, that could be considered "deliberate indifference" by the 
city to its citizens' welfare, and the municipality might then be held liable 
in a damage suit. 
</P>
<P>
But this is the extreme exception, he said, adding that cities must not be 
exposed to "unprecedented liability" merely because "an injury or accident 
could have been avoided if an officer had had better or more training." 
Moreover, juries must not be permitted to engage in "an endless exercise of 
second-guessing" of local officials' decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The justices sent the case of Geraldine Harris back to an appeals panel in 
Cincinnati to decide whether she deserves a new trial. In 1978, Harris was 
arrested by Canton policemen but slumped to the floor at the jailhouse, 
suffering emotional problems for which she later was hospitalized. Her suit 
contends that her constitutional rights were violated because the police failed 
to give her adequate medical care (Canton vs. Harris, 86-1088). 
</P>
<P>
The high court Tuesday made no mention of last week's ruling in a child abuse 
case, which, on its face, came to a nearly opposite result. But lawyers say the 
two cases are distinct. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's ruling dealt with a situation in which a government or its employees 
take action, such as a police officer's collaring a citizen or holding him in 
custody. Then, the government may be sued under limited circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, last week's decision dealt with a failure to act by county 
workers. In that situation, in which a father nearly beat his young son to 
death, the county may not be sued in federal courts, the court said, because it 
had no obligation under the U.S. Constitution to protect its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys representing cities and counties said they were pleased with the 
latest ruling and predicted that it would end most federal suits against local 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
"The court has set a very high standard, because you (as an injured citizen) 
have to prove that local elected officials acted deliberately, and with 
indifference, and that this caused the injury," said Benna Solomon, chief 
counsel for the National League of Cities and other government groups. "I think 
there are very few cases that can meet that standard."

CHICAGO'S POSH LIBERAL WARDS JOIN WITH REST OF WHITE VOTERS TO BACK SON OF 
'BOSS'

<P>
Jeff Toth stepped up to a polling booth at the Abraham Lincoln School Tuesday 
and did something that not long ago would have been considered unusual by the 
electoral norms of the independent-minded 43rd Ward. 
</P>
<P>
He voted for Richard Daley in the Democratic mayoral primary, as did most of 
Toth's friends and neighbors in the north side Lincoln Park area. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't that Richard Daley, of course, but rather his son, Cook County 
State's Atty. Richard M. Daley, who was battling Acting Mayor Eugene Sawyer for 
the party nomination that for decades has been tantamount to a general election 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Breeding Ground for Opposition 
</P>
<P>
Long the mainstay of liberal, independent politics in Chicago, the 43rd and a 
handful of other wards along the city's posh lakefront were the breeding ground 
for opposition to the elder Daley, still referred to as "The Boss" for his 
iron-fisted control of City Hall and the old Democratic machine. 
</P>
<P>
While the rest of white Chicago fiercely resisted political empowerment for 
minorities, the lakefront wards provided the margin of victory for Harold 
Washington when he became the city's first black mayor in 1983 and was 
reelected four years later. 
</P>
<P>
This time around, however, the lakefront by and large fell in step with other 
white neighborhoods in backing Daley over Sawyer, who is black, propelling 
Daley to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the point, a CBS exit poll predicted that 78% of all whites across 
the city who voted for Washington in 1987 had cast their vote for Daley this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
It represented a remarkable change in voting patterns that had more to do with 
the pervasive nature of racial polarization in this city than any groundswell 
of affection for Daley himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questions Sawyer's Associates 
</P>
<P>
"Sawyer's OK, but I'm just not happy with the people he's associated with," 
said Toth, a white construction executive who backed Washington in previous 
elections. "You're no longer allowed to criticize people in the city of 
Chicago. As soon as you do, they (Sawyer's people) call you a racist, even if 
they're incompetent and unqualified." 
</P>
<P>
The latest struggle for City Hall has forced many white liberals, weary of 
bizarre racial incidents and charges, to rethink one of their most cherished 
beliefs -- that race should be irrelevant in such contests. 
</P>
<P>
During Washington's tenure, conservative whites were clearly at the core of 
black-white friction in the city. They mocked his campaign with racist slogans 
and banners and, once elected, tried to block his legislative program in the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Under Sawyer, however, tensions seemed to flow more from the black community. 
Last spring, blacks and Jews came to loggerheads when Sawyer dragged his feet 
in firing a controversial aide, Steve Cokely, over anti-Semitic lectures that 
accused Jewish doctors of injecting black babies with the AIDS virus. And over 
the last week, several prominent Sawyer backers have warned of dire 
consequences if whites were returned to power. 
</P>
<P>
Low-key and polite to a fault, Sawyer has sought to distance himself from such 
comments. But the damage was done. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm one of those perverse liberals who would rather vote for a black because I 
feel they should have a chance at power," said Ellen Pritzker, who lives in a 
lakeshore high-rise in the 43rd Ward. " . . . But the inflammatory racial 
comments of the last few days have indicated to me that the gulf is too wide." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coalition of Liberals 
</P>
<P>
Jews represented a small, but extremely influential and active portion of the 
wide-ranging biracial coalition of liberals that put Washington into power and 
kept him there. Now Jews have abandoned Sawyer in droves. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Cokely affair, I was hard-pressed to know anybody who was Jewish -- 
I hate to say it -- who would vote for a black," said June Rossner, a public 
relations executive who was a close adviser to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Several prominent white liberals who fought tooth and nail against the elder 
Daley have signed on to the campaign of his son. Among them is former Alderman 
William Singer, who once opposed the late mayor in a Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
Such defections are by no means universal or solely linked to distress over 
racial tensions. But many liberals who backed Sawyer admit they were doing so 
unenthusiastically and with the hope that he would be easier to unseat at the 
next election by a candidate more to their liking. "I'm just afraid that if 
Daley gets in, he's in for life," said Alton Miller, who was Washington's press 
secretary. "If Sawyer gets in it may only be for another two years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agony Over Unhappy Choice 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many liberals said they agonized over their vote for the first time in 
years. "It's a choice between short-term petty thievery (Sawyer) and long-term 
autocracy," said Marilyn Katz, a public relations executive and former campaign 
aide to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Callahan, a part-time social worker from the upscale Edgewater 
neighborhood, said she felt "like a Ping-Pong ball" for days before deciding on 
Monday to back Sawyer. Still, she said, her husband, Michael, an attorney, went 
with Daley.

ARMED SERVICES PANEL MEMBERS FILE CONFLICTING VIEWS ON TOWER

<P>
The 11 Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee said in a report 
Tuesday that John Tower has a record of excessive drinking and indiscreet 
behavior with women that disqualifies him from becoming President Bush's 
secretary of defense. 
</P>
<P>
Nine Republicans on the same committee, however, insisted that there was no 
credible evidence that Tower ever allowed alcohol to interfere with the 
performance of his duties and said he is "fully and ably qualified" to take 
over the Pentagon. He never had sexual liaisons that could subject him to 
blackmail or embarrass the United States, they added, and his other 
relationships with women were private and none of the committee's business. 
</P>
<P>
The 11 Democrats said Tower's switch from being a U.S. nuclear arms negotiator 
to a highly paid consultant for major defense contractors "created the 
appearance of using inside information for private gain." The nine GOP members, 
however, said the panel was trying to set a "new standard" and declared that 
Tower had no conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backdrop for Battle 
</P>
<P>
The majority and minority views were filed with the Senate, providing a written 
backdrop for a floor battle over Tower's confirmation expected to begin today 
with odds apparently against the former Texas senator. 
</P>
<P>
The detailed allegations, however, were omitted from the report and kept for 
senators' eyes only in a secret repository in the form of an addition to the 
majority report, together with eight installments of FBI reports on Tower's 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the portions made public repeated familiar arguments made by 
advocates and opponents of Tower's nomination without any startling new 
disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic report, however, said one document relating to Tower's service 
as an arms negotiator in Geneva was "destroyed" by the Office of Personnel 
Management "as a routine matter" despite the committee's request for it. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the panel received another copy of the document from the House Energy 
and Commerce Committee, the report said. The committee majority concluded there 
was no evidence, however, that Tower was involved with foreign nationals in a 
way that would constitute a security risk. 
</P>
<P>
In their report, the Democrats said Tower has a number of strong qualifications 
for the defense secretary's job but their overall assessment was unfavorable. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats also charged there were "significant inconsistencies" in what 
Tower told the FBI at first, what he told them later, what he told the 
committee in closed session and what he has said in public statements about his 
use of alcohol. But it gave no examples, saying they could be found in the 
addendum available for senators' viewing only. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Indiscreet Behavior' 
</P>
<P>
"These concerns included: (1) excessive use of alcohol; (2) the provision of 
consulting services to defense contractors on the probable outcomes of ongoing, 
confidential arms control negotiations shortly after serving as an arms control 
negotiator, which created the appearance of using public office for private 
gain; and (3) a number of incidents of indiscreet behavior toward women," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans, however, disagreed on all three counts. They said Tower's private 
life -- his relationships with women that would not subject him to blackmail or 
embarrass the United States -- should not even be a matter for the committee's 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
"We reject the recommendation of the majority because it is apparently based 
upon a body of fact and allegation lacking the weight of corroboration required 
by Senate precedents of 200 years," the nine GOP senators said.

ELIZABETH TAYLOR'S DRUG DOSAGES PROBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Several physicians are under investigation by state and local prosecutors to 
determine whether they over-prescribed potentially addictive drugs to actress 
Elizabeth Taylor, a Los Angeles County district attorney's spokesman said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 57-year-old actress was not available for comment, she 
acknowledged a year and a half ago that she underwent treatment for addiction 
to painkiller pills and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
District attorney's spokesman Al Albergate would say only that the 
investigation involves allegations that excessive amounts of various opiates, 
barbiturates and stimulants were prescribed for Taylor. Neither the drugs nor 
the doctors were identified. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry, Albergate said, is being conducted by the state attorney general's 
office with the assistance of the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking about a prescription mill that prescribes for people off the 
street," said Albergate. "We're talking about one patient -- who happens to 
have celebrity status." 
</P>
<P>
When the attorney general's office investigation ends, Albergate said, "they 
will turn it over to us to make a decision on whether to file a criminal 
complaint." 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office, he said, could simply refer the matter to the 
state Board of Medical Quality Assurance for disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation reportedly began after state officials noticed that excessive 
amounts of potentially addictive drugs had been prescribed for Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Justice spokeswoman Kati Corsaut said prescriptions for 
Schedule 2 drugs -- those with a high potential for addiction -- must be 
written in triplicate on forms provided by the attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor went public about her addiction in August, 1987, when she told 
Cosmopolitan magazine there was "no question" she would have died without 
treatment at the Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho Mirage.

MCMARTIN TRIAL WITNESS CALLS INTERVIEWS 'INVALID' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first significant defense witness in the McMartin Pre-School molestation 
trial, a psychologist highly critical of the interview methods used with the 
alleged child victims, took the stand late Tuesday, but his testimony was cut 
short by prosecution objections. 
</P>
<P>
In a special hearing earlier in the day with the jury excused, psychologist 
Michael Maloney told the judge that his review of interviews conducted at 
Children's Institute International had led him to conclude that the interviews 
are "definitely invalid" and that "they (the children) were so contaminated by 
the process itself that, no matter what they said, at the end you'd have a hard 
time saying where it (their accounts) came from." 
</P>
<P>
Maloney said he watched and analyzed the videotaped interviews and read the 
transcripts, word by word, asking himself, "Are these children saying things I 
cannot account for by their being told?" But he cautioned that, based on the 
tapes alone, "I can't answer the final question -- whether these kids were 
molested or not." 
</P>
<P>
The defense's primary argument is that inept interviewers used suggestive 
questions and pressure to lead children to say -- and sometimes believe -- that 
they had been molested by teachers at the Manhattan Beach nursery school. 
Prosecutors relied heavily on the interviews in deciding to file charges. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders said he would allow Maloney 
to testify because Pounders views the videotapes as "one of the central issues, 
if not the central issue," of the case. 
</P>
<P>
In late afternoon testimony before the jury, however, Maloney had scarcely 
recited his credentials before the prosecutors objected to the showing of large 
charts and excerpts rearranged by subject from the videotapes of the nine 
children who eventually testified. Pounders halted the proceeding for the day 
and will take up the matter this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Maloney, a clinical psychologist who is an associate professor of psychiatry at 
the USC School of Medicine and director of a Pasadena clinic, said he has 
evaluated "hundreds" of children in which sexual abuse was an issue. 
</P>
<P>
He is the 33rd defense witness to testify in the trial of Raymond Buckey, 30, 
and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, who are charged with a total of 65 
counts of molestation and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the defense has called several former teachers from the school, 
including two former defendants, neighbors and friends. Employees of a grocery 
store and a car wash, where children said they were taken for illicit purposes, 
also testified, as well as principals associated with a church and a farm where 
prosecutors believe that children watched animal sacrifices and satanic 
rituals. 
</P>
<P>
All witnesses have denied knowledge of any molestations.

11 OTHER HOLLYWOODS GET TOGETHER TO GROUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY BEARAK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the mountaintops of Hollywood, N.M., to the tobacco fields of Hollywood, 
Md., officials from 11 Hollywoods big, small, and smaller yet gathered here 
Tuesday in a so-called "Hollywood Summit." 
</P>
<P>
Their mission -- besides getting a free trip to Florida -- was to link arms in 
a legal battle against "that greedy Tinseltown" of the West Coast, which "wants 
the name Hollywood all to itself." 
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Commerce for Los Angeles' Hollywood has filed with the U.S. 
Patent and Trademark Office to gain exclusive use of the name for commercial 
purposes -- on T-shirts, coffee mugs and the like. 
</P>
<P>
That is not a popular proposal with the left-out Hollywoods. "I'd shoot any of 
them from California, they came through my town," said Ross Dover, 
representative of the rural mountain hamlet of Hollywood, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
His sentiments were not so different from those of folks from Hollywoods in 
Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, New 
Mexico, South Carolina and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, as the day moved along -- and group photos were taken for what 
seemed like the millionth time -- the representatives decided instead to follow 
the less-violent lead of Hollywood, Fla., which is using a local law firm to 
challenge the trademark application. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what happens, none of the various Hollywoods would have to give up 
its name, though they fear they might be restricted in marketing anything with 
the name Hollywood on it. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood, Calif., Chamber denies that there would be any such restrictions 
-- as long as the other Hollywoods' mementos also include the name of the 
appropriate state. It issued a press release calling the protesting cities 
"misinformed, with minds set in concrete," and pointed a finger at Hollywood, 
Fla., Mayor Mara Giulanti. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to make them pay to use the name," Chamber President Bill 
Welsh insisted. "We have tried time and again to tell that lady and other 
people down there . . . and we just can't seem to get the point across." 
</P>
<P>
But though there may not be much money at stake, there's plenty of principle, 
according to the Hollywood representatives who gathered here Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole thing is not only asinine, it's un-American," charged Chris Garrett 
of the Hollywood, Fla., Chamber of Commerce. "Hollywood, Calif., is just 
tinsel. They didn't get that name for nothing. They earned it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Texan's Reaction 
</P>
<P>
Mayor B. K. Srinivas of Hollywood, Tex., said sarcastically, "Maybe I ought to 
just change my name to Smith and license that." 
</P>
<P>
Speculation romped. After all, where would it end? Would similar battles have 
to be fought among America's many Springfields, Jeffersons and Independences? 
Could Rome, Ga., swallow up Rome, N.Y., and then go after Rome, Italy? 
</P>
<P>
"If Hollywood, Calif., thinks its name is so great, why does it mind sharing 
it?" asked an angry Jack Ellis of Hollywood, La. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood, Calif., Chamber of Commerce has been trying to get trademark 
status since 1986, insisting that revenues from the sale of souvenirs would be 
used for upkeep of the Hollywood sign and to touch up some fading stars among 
the more than 1,800 in the Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
That plan especially rankles oceanside Hollywood, Fla. (population 125,000), 
something of a tourist town itself -- self-proclaimed "Dream City Come True" -- 
halfway between Miami and Ft. Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
It has its own Chamber of Commerce, whose officers are not only spoiling for 
the fight but prepared to use the scrap for all the publicity it can muster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gratis Accommodations 
</P>
<P>
The Chamber here, along with city officials, managed to get their Hollywood 
brethren free flights into town, free limousine service and free hotel rooms. 
All that -- plus pictures with a guy in a 7-foot-tall egret costume. 
</P>
<P>
Taking turns at a podium during a press conference, the representatives of the 
various Hollywoods looked like something Central Casting might have sent from 
the more famous Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Bard Seldon from the Mississippi Delta is a huge and bearded man whose hometown 
has one store, which sells crickets for bait. "More people where I live have 
heard of Hollywood, Miss., than Hollywood, Calif.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ross Dover from rural Georgia had lost one arm in the Army and vowed he would 
fight this trademark battle to the end of his life and the last bean in his 
pocket. "If there's any money to be made on the name Hollywood, it ought to go 
to little people instead of a bunch of movie stars," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Ellis from Louisiana seemed a timid sort. He allowed that he had visited 
Hollywood, Calif., once: "Unfriendliest place I ever saw. Couldn't get anyone 
to talk to you. Ask them a question and they just walked away." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Illinois Representative 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Riedlinger is from a middle-class Chicago suburb. His Hollywood, now a 
subdivision of the town of Brookfield, is the original and Hollywood, Calif., 
is named after the estate of a woman from there, his research shows. He read 
from a proclamation of his civic association: "Do not make the name of 
Hollywood synonomous with profit . . . pledge with us to make Hollywood stand 
for the simple, natural beauty which prompted our naming." 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood, Calif., was not unrepresented at the many microphones. Marian 
Gibbons of the preservationist group Hollywood Heritage said the actions of her 
Chamber of Commerce don't reflect the community in general. "It's just a 
moneymaking thing, and that's not what Hollywood is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Later, after a closed-door strategy session, Gibbons remarked that she was 
stunned by all the animosity. "This is all being taken quite seriously, isn't 
it?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
But then it was time to head off to a reception. The aggrieved Hollywoods were 
having free cocktails and dinner.

CLOSURES AND REOPENINGS LEAVE STAFFS BEWILDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was not exactly business as usual Tuesday morning at Coastal Community 
Health Clinic in Carson. Like seven other psychiatric centers in Los Angeles 
County, the clinic was suddenly reopened after being shut down the day before. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Joel Foxman, the clinic's director, looked bewildered about 9 a.m. as he 
removed the clinic's newly posted closure sign from the door. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the third time that we've had signs on the door to close the clinic 
and have then taken them down," he said. "I had no doubt that this time we were 
really closing." 
</P>
<P>
The false alarms have all occurred since the clinic was targeted for shutdown 
last July in response to an $18-million shortfall in state mental health funds. 
</P>
<P>
"This is enough to drive you crazy," said visitor Ester Rabb, a South Bay 
mental health coordinator. "There's nothing to save here," she said, surveying 
a room of empty cubicles and stacked furniture. "Everything is boxed up. Most 
of the staff has gone and the rest are leaving. They've sent the patients off." 
</P>
<P>
As with other clinics that had been marked for closure, the sudden reopening 
left weary administrative personnel wondering what to do next and how long they 
will be kept afloat. While no patients were scheduled for treatment or therapy 
sessions at Coastal on Tuesday, clinic psychiatrists treated more than a dozen 
people who came by anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Granucci, a social worker who is being laid off Friday, continued his final 
clinic task, helping to box 15,000 patient charts for storage or shredding. 
</P>
<P>
Into a big brown box marked for destruction in the year 2003, Granucci 
deposited the chart of a 3-year-old girl from Gardena who had been molested by 
her father and was suffering from "post-traumatic stress disorder" when she was 
last seen at the clinic six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think they're really going to be able to find this little girl's chart 
if she comes back in?" Granucci said. "This feels really futile." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sad Story' 
</P>
<P>
Into another box, Granucci said, will go the charts of a 50-year-old man who 
lives in his car and is possessed by his former wife's infidelity and a desire 
to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
Each file, Granucci said, is a person's life. "Each one is a story, a sad 
story." 
</P>
<P>
Foxman said that 80% of the files have been boxed and that he has no plans to 
"unbox" them. 
</P>
<P>
At its peak, the clinic treated more than 1,000 adults and 300 children. "Most 
of our patients are poor and jobless," Foxman said. "They are not dangerous or 
violent. They are frightened, fragile creatures who without our care will 
withdraw further from society, ending up as transients or homeless people on 
the street." 
</P>
<P>
About 30 of the children and 250 medication-dependent adults are being 
transferred to other clinics. The rest will have their files placed in storage 
along with thousands of other inactive cases. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done the equivalent of preparing ourselves for dying. We were ready to 
let go," Foxman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have this stay of execution," clinic secretary Pam Pyn said. "It's just 
prolonging the agony." 
</P>
<P>
It has been an intense time for staffers, made more difficult by the recent 
murder of a former colleague. Robbyn Panitch, the psychiatric social worker who 
was stabbed to death a week ago by a mental patient at the Santa Monica West 
Mental Health Center, until recently worked at Coastal. Like many other Coastal 
staff members, she sought a transfer when it was announced that Coastal would 
close. 
</P>
<P>
Transfers and resignations have cut Coastal's staff from 50 to 30. Ten more 
people are being laid off Friday. And the rest are being scheduled for 
transfer. 
</P>
<P>
"The system is so sick itself that many nice competent people are leaving to go 
places that are more secure, more considerate and more respectful," Foxman 
said.

Several shipments of steroids from South America valued at more than $500,000 
have been confiscated and an employee of an air courier company arrested in El 
Segundo in the largest such seizure ever in the Los Angeles area, authorities 
said Tuesday.

Lowell Coble, 49, of Venice was taken into custody Saturday by U.S. Customs

Coble's arrest and the seizure of more than 130,000 doses of steroids came 
after a Customs inspector became suspicious of a package from Brazil, 
Villaneuva said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Robert Bonner said a criminal complaint was filed against Coble, 
charging him with possessing a large quantity of anabolic steroids for sale and 
with receiving steroids while knowing that they had been illegally imported 
from Brazil.

 PLAN WOULD EXPAND RETAIL PARKING SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Planning Commission gave initial approval Tuesday to a plan to 
dramatically boost parking requirements for new commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, new retail buildings would have to provide four parking spaces 
for every 1,000 square feet instead of the current two. Large restaurants would 
need 10 spaces for every 1,000 square feet rather than the two now required. 
The plan would not affect parking requirements at new office buildings.

 3-YEAR SENTENCE IN FALSE BOMB THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who claimed to have a bomb while taking a hostage in a Century City 
high-rise last May, forcing the evacuation of 100 people, has been sentenced to 
three years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Superior Court Judge David Perez imposed the sentence on Renard Z. 
Jones, 34, who pleaded guilty to one count each of false imprisonment, assault 
with a deadly weapon and making a false bomb threat. 
</P>
<P>
Jones was declared mentally incompetent last September and was committed to a 
state hospital, but authorities later ruled that he had regained his mental 
faculties and the case against him proceeded. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began last May 4 when Jones arrived at the Century City office of 
an attorney in the Fox Plaza Building complaining about legal work being done 
for him. The attorney was not in his 26th-floor office at the time, and Jones, 
claiming to have a gun, then took a legal secretary hostage. After Jones 
boasted that he was also armed with a bomb, police evacuated the 25th, 26th and 
27th floors. 
</P>
<P>
An eight-hour standoff ended when police blew the door off of the firm's 
offices, freed the secretary and arrested Jones. No bomb or gun was found.

 CHER'S BOYFRIEND PLEADS NO CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cher's boyfriend pleaded no contest Tuesday to two counts of vandalism for 
smashing a photographer's camera equipment outside the Benedict Canyon home of 
the Oscar-winning actress. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney John Forbes entered the plea on behalf of Rob Camilletti, 24, who was 
not in court, Deputy City Atty. Renee Laurents said. 
</P>
<P>
Camilletti, a former New York bagel maker, pizza chef and bartender, faces up 
to a year in jail and a $2,000 fine when he is sentenced March 14. 
</P>
<P>
The charges stem from an incident last July in which Camilletti had a run-in 
with free-lance photographers who were staking out Cher's home. Camilletti was 
accused of trying to run photographer Peter Brandt down in a Ferrari and 
damaging his camera equipment.

2 GANG MEMBERS HELD IN DRIVE-BY KILLING OF GIRL, 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Two 16-year-old gang members, including a leader of a major Central American 
gang in the Pico-Union area, have been arrested in the drive-by shooting death 
of an 11-year-old girl and the wounding of her aunt last weekend, Los Angeles 
police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-agers, both Salvadoran immigrants who belong to the same gang, were 
arrested separately Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning and booked for 
investigation of murder, said Lt. Rob Watters of the Rampart Division. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the suspects, who are being detained at Eastlake Juvenile Hall, 
were not released because of their ages. Investigators declined to elaborate 
further on specifics about their gang. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives were seeking two other gang members in the shooting, Watters said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relatively Quick Capture 
</P>
<P>
The age of victim Jasmine Guevara was instrumental in the relatively quick 
capture of suspects, Watters said. It spurred many in the outraged community to 
provide officers with tips on the suspects and focused police and media 
attention on the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Jasmine Guevara was walking home from a liquor store with her aunt, Blanca 
Guevara, 42, and her 14-year-old sister, Melda, when she was gunned down by 
shotgun blasts in the 1800 block of Orchard Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Melda Guevara was not hurt, but several shotgun pellets hit Jasmine and her 
aunt, killing the girl and leaving the older woman seriously wounded. The shots 
fired Saturday night were meant for rival gang members who were standing 
nearby, Watters said. 
</P>
<P>
Police found the stolen red Chevrolet Camaro used in the drive-by shooting in 
the 2500 block of 11th Street on Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Were Scared' 
</P>
<P>
"It's unusual for (gang members) to torch a vehicle," Watters said. "They were 
scared." 
</P>
<P>
Later Monday, a leader of the gang walked into the Rampart Division station. 
</P>
<P>
"He came in here to string us along; to give us information on others in the 
gang. And we were able to get enough information to realize he, himself, was 
involved," Watters said. 
</P>
<P>
The gang leader was taken into custody. Police subsequently were able to locate 
and arrest the second suspect as he left his home Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the home, officers found two 12-gauge shotguns believed to be the murder 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated incident, a 17-year-old boy who escaped with seven other youths 
from Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall on Saturday surrendered to police Tuesday. 
Dennis Haven surrendered to police in a Crenshaw District law office as his 
family sobbed in the background. 
</P>
<P>
Haven notified his family about 30 minutes after he escaped, relatives said. 
They contacted the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People to help 
negotiate his surrender.

BOMBS HIT 2 BERKELEY BOOKSTORES; 
</P>
<P>
N.Y. PAPER DAMAGED; BUSH ASSAILS VIOLENCE OVER RUSHDIE NOVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Pre-dawn firebombs hurled through windows Tuesday damaged two Berkeley book 
stores, one a literary and political landmark whose owner had vowed publicly to 
resist Islamic pressure to stop selling "The Satanic Verses," as violence 
apparently broke out around the Salman Rushdie novel. 
</P>
<P>
A loaded pipe bomb was later discovered inside the landmark Cody's book store 
near the University of California campus and safely detonated by police, while 
in New York the offices of a weekly newspaper that defended Rushdie suffered 
serious damage from a third firebomb. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the attacks. In Berkeley, Cody's and the Waldenbooks 
outlet on Telegraph Avenue suffered minor fire damage. Radio station KPFA-FM in 
Berkeley also received a threatening telephone call about a Tuesday program of 
readings from the Rushdie book. 
</P>
<P>
The bombings Tuesday were the first violent incidents directed at Americans 
since Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called on Muslims to kill Rushdie and 
exact other retribution for alleged offenses against Islam in the novel by the 
Indian-born writer. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, President Bush told reporters at the conclusion of a Cabinet 
meeting Tuesday that his Administration would not tolerate further violent 
protests aimed at the Rushdie novel. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't yet know if the bombings are related to the book, 'The Satanic 
Verses.' But let me be clear -- anyone undertaking acts of intimidation or 
violence aimed at the author, the publishers, or the distributors of "The 
Satanic Verses" will be prosecuted to the maximum extent of the law. 
</P>
<P>
"And while the details surrounding these incidents and the motives of those who 
carried them out are still unclear, I think it is important to take this 
occasion to state where the U.S. government and, I'm convinced the American 
people, stand on violence and on our rights. 
</P>
<P>
"This country was founded on the principles of free speech and religious 
tolerance. And we fought throughout our history to protect these principles. 
And I want to make unequivocally clear that the United States will not tolerate 
any assault on these rights of American citizens." 
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks, so police do not have any 
clear links to Muslim extremists. But both Berkeley stores had announced their 
intentions to resume sales of "The Satanic Verses" when new shipments arrived. 
The weekly Riverdale Press in Manhattan had published a pro-Rushdie editorial 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, artist Steve Mellow, founder of the Readers Theater, said he 
planned a tribute Friday to Rushdie at the beginning of his monthly session on 
"transformation" at Scribner Book Store in Costa Mesa. Neither Scribner nor 
representatives of the shopping center where the book store is situated were 
available for comment Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Mellow said Scribner representatives were aware of what he planned to do and 
have expressed safety concerns about the reading. "I don't think they would 
stop the tribute. But I would go along with whatever they decide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mellow added that he did not choose Rushdie's book because of the controversy 
it has generated. "I am always looking for any opportunity to bring focus on a 
living author to the public," he said. "I'm not looking to catch on to a 
sensational idea." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Berkeley Police Lt. Michel de Latour confirmed late Tuesday that 
police had searched at least two apartments of Muslim students near campus an 
hour after the bombings. Zakia Henry, one of the students, told The Times that 
police came to her apartment at the Rochdale building about 5:30 a.m., searched 
the premises and said only that they were looking for suspects. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just treating it as a regular crime, but it's probably not that," Latour 
said. "So far, we don't have anyone taking responsibility for this, so we have 
no motive. But you can certainly speculate what the motive might be." 
</P>
<P>
Andy Ross, owner of Cody's, said Tuesday, "It looks like a pretty fair 
assumption to me" that the bombs were related to his high-profile stance 
against Muslim efforts to quash the Rushdie book. 
</P>
<P>
A 3-foot-high poster was still hanging from the ceiling Tuesday proclaiming 
that "The Satanic Verses" would be sold openly when the new shipments arrive. 
"All booksellers, all writers, all publishers, all readers are victims of the 
intellectual terrorism that is being directed against Mr. Rushdie. . . . We 
feel that this policy is a small but important act if we are to triumph over 
terror," the poster stated. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was controlled shortly after being set about 4 a.m., and employees 
were still sweeping up about 8:15 a.m. when a janitor discovered the pipe bomb. 
The foot-long device was hidden under a book cart. The store was evacuated, and 
a Berkeley police unit detonated the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Ross said he planned to call his employees together to discuss security and 
consider if they should go ahead with plans to sell the Rushdie novel. He 
added: "I want to sell the book, but I have to think about my employees. You 
shouldn't have to have your life on the line to sell books in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Cody's has been a welcome haven for political activists, writers and 
intellectuals on Telegraph Avenue since the Free Speech Movement days in 
Berkeley in the '60s. "Believe it or not, all through the People's Park 
protests when every other shop window was getting broken, nothing happened to 
Cody's," store manager Nick Setka said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gammon, manager at the Waldenbooks store, said the damage was confined to a 
small circle of carpet. He said business went on as usual Tuesday and restated 
that the store would continue to sell "The Satanic Verses" when new supplies 
arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Barry, manager at Shambala Booksellers two doors away from Cody's, said 
book stores are being put in an awkward position by the Rushdie controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents failed to deter Viking Penguin Inc., Rushdie's besieged publisher 
from working Tuesday to get an additional printing into stores across the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
"The new printing should be in the stores any day now, and certainly by next 
week," said a Viking spokesman in New York. " . . . We'll see them spread out 
among the independent sellers, the chains and wholesalers. It all depends on 
the middlemen, how quickly they get them out. They're in the pipeline, and the 
idea has been to spread them out around the country, not just dump most of them 
in New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Security at Viking Penguin continued to be extremely tight. The publisher has 
received repeated bomb threats, the latest on Friday, forcing periodic 
evacuations of its building on 23rd Street in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
New York Mayor Edward I. Koch offered a $10,000 reward for those responsible 
for the bombing of the Riverdale Press and gave the family of its publisher 
police protection. The newspaper's building in Upper Manhattan was badly burned 
and two parked cars were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Police and fire officials said that witnesses saw a man in a brown station 
wagon hurl an explosive device at the offices at about 4:30 a.m. As the 
assailant fled, his vehicle sideswiped a city ambulance. The ambulance driver 
tried to catch the station wagon but was unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
By daylight, dozens of police and federal agents had converged on the scene. 
Assistant Fire Commissioner John Mulligan said there was no concrete evidence 
that the firebombing was connected to a pro-Rushdie editorial the newspaper had 
published last week. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that it had something to do with something that was printed in the 
paper," co-publisher Richard Stein said. "But I don't know what." 
</P>
<P>
He said the paper, which was a Pulitzer Prize finalist last year for the second 
time, would be able to print its edition this week despite the damage. The 
39-year-old weekly serving an area near the Hudson River in Upper Manhattan, 
has a circulation of about 14,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
Police and the FBI were investigating the possibility that the bombing might be 
connected to an incident at a nearby private school last Friday when a stolen 
car was set on fire and driven through the cafeteria windows of the Horace Mann 
School. Headmaster Gordon Newcome said Tuesday that the school had not received 
any threats.

Francisco contributed to this story.

IRVINE APPROVES $1.75-MILLION FOR CHILD CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what could be first-of-its-kind financing in the state for child care, the 
Irvine City Council on Tuesday night authorized a $1.75- million bond sale with 
the local school district to place child-care centers at schools. 
</P>
<P>
The funds will be used to buy portable buildings to be placed at seven school 
sites for after-school care for 350 elementary school students. The agency 
formed by the city and school district already has built six day-care centers 
at schools for the care of 270 children. 
</P>
<P>
The loan will be guaranteed by the Irvine Co., which has issued a letter of 
credit to the Irvine Child Care Project, the joint powers authority formed by 
the city and Irvine Unified School District to develop the after-school 
day-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
The project is empowered to raise money through the sale of bonds, just as the 
city or the school district is, said Deanna Manning, director of community 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The letter of credit means neither the city nor the school district is at 
financial risk for the bond sale, she said. "It's our collateral. So if we 
can't make the payments, the Irvine Co. will." She called the letter of credit 
for such a bond sale "unprecedented." 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine City Council approved the bond sale without comment. The Irvine 
Unified School District Board of Trustees gave its nod to the loan last week. 
</P>
<P>
The joint powers authority now must approve the bond sale to "close the deal," 
Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Child Care Project was set up expressly to develop after-school care 
facilities at elementary schools. It received $250,000 in start-up money from 
the Irvine Co. and $20,000 from the city. The school district contributed the 
land and overhead, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
The child-care project will not operate the centers but will issue licenses to 
child-care providers, who will pay rent for the facilities, she said. The rent 
will pay off the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The first six school day-care centers were started without bond money. The 
$270,000 in start-up grants financed five; the sixth was built by the Irvine 
Children's Fund, a nonprofit organization, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
The next seven centers are expected to be ready for the school year beginning 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, considered a leader in child-care policies among local cities, appears 
to be unique in using the bond approach to finance day-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Hailey, children's services consultant to state Senate Office of Research, 
said it was the first time he had heard of a public agency issuing bonds for 
child care. 
</P>
<P>
Hailey called the solution well-suited to a growing city like Irvine. "This is 
not a way that a lot (of child-care centers) are going to be built, but for 
cities like Irvine, where there is growth and land, I hope those city 
governments and school districts take a look at this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Start-up costs to build or renovate child-care centers often are prohibitively 
expensive. One child-care consultant said constructing a building for 75 to 100 
children can easily cost $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
A 5-month-old child-care center on the new Irvine City Hall grounds -- believed 
to be the first of its kind in the state and one of the first in the nation -- 
was built with bond money, but the bonds were issued for construction of the 
entire City Hall complex, of which the $1.2-million Irvine Child Development 
Center was a part. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), chairwoman of the Senate Health and 
Human Services Committee, is sponsoring a bill authorizing a $300-million bond 
issue to finance low-interest loans for the construction or expansion of 
child-care facilities, said an aide, Joyce Iseri. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine is not alone in setting up day care at schools. In Pomona, the school 
district sponsors an extensive child-care program -- including 15 centers and 
programs for toddlers and preschoolers as well as schoolchildren -- and has 
been heralded as one of the best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine was one of the first cities in the state to set up a child-care 
committee and hire a full-time child-care coordinator. The city council has 
adopted a policy which calls for child care to be available to every resident 
or worker who needs it by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Manning said the Irvine Co. has given money to the cause because its 
developments bring dual-career families and single parents to the city. 
Children in those families have a pressing need for safe and adequate child 
care, she said. 
</P>
<P>
While "latchkey" child care for schoolchildren is one of the city's most 
pressing needs, the city-school district venture is but one of many child-care 
programs promoted by the city. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of ways to approach child care, and we decided we would use 
a multi-pronged approach," Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has sponsored a child-care center operated by Irvine Valley College at 
Heritage Park and is working with a consortium of business interests in using 
the temporary City Hall building as a day-care center for employees' children 
after the facility is vacated. 
</P>
<P>
The city also sponsors school-age day care for children at five parks and works 
with private child-care providers to encourage development of new centers, 
Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
The bond issue for additional day-care centers at the schools will not fill the 
entire gap for latchkey care "but this will push us a long way toward our 
goal," Manning said.

ANOTHER BIRD OF PREY FALLS VICTIM OF GUNSHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One more bird, an American kestrel falcon, has died after it was found shot in 
Anaheim, bringing to 31 the number of birds of prey that have been killed or 
wounded throughout Orange County in a mysterious rash of shootings. 
</P>
<P>
The falcon was discovered late Sunday at the base of a palm tree in a 
residential neighborhood, but attempts to save the bird were unsuccessful, said 
Marge Gibson, a wild bird rehabilitation specialist in Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
She said the falcons, which are solitary predators, often nest in palm trees. 
These provide protection and food, particularly mice, which also like to nest 
in them.

PEOPLE: JACK OF ALL TRADES WONDERS WHERE HE'LL WANDER NEXT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert J. Vida 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Logue has sold cemetery plots, was a logger, a ranch hand, hosted a 
late-night avant-garde radio show for 3 1/2 years, served in the Navy and now 
works as a legal secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done a lot of strange things," he said. "I was even the weird one in my 
school days." 
</P>
<P>
Now 33, he says little has changed. "I'm only being me and I'm different," said 
Logue, who uses eye makeup, wears dangling earrings to work and binds his long 
hair in a ponytail. "I want to be honest with myself and honest with the 
world." But he adds, "I still don't know what I want to do when I grow up." 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, however, he said he has discovered a creative outlet in 
Poets Reading Inc. of Fullerton, which he helped form last year. 
</P>
<P>
The founding group, all from Fullerton, consists of Logue, his fiancee, Tina 
Rinaldi, 23, a hair stylist; local poet Dean Hartley, a former professor at Cal 
State Fullerton, and a few volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
The reading sometimes draws a standing-room-only crowd of 100. "They come to 
enjoy hearing the written word," said the Fullerton College graduate. "I have 
the sense that people would rather come here and pay $2 than watch television." 
</P>
<P>
The group meets every other Saturday in a small hall at the Fullerton Museum 
Center to give poetry readings and that of other writing, sometimes in dramatic 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, he adds, "A lot of people really want to read their poetry before 
an audience." 
</P>
<P>
Logue said he was "scared the first time I was a reader, because I put a 
dramatic flair into my reading. I felt that the greatest writers in the world 
can be boring readers and I didn't want to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, short story and one-act drama writers, as well as poets, are 
presenting their work in sometimes unorthodox readings. At times, the featured 
reader is a singer who sings his poetry, and some people with drama backgrounds 
give performances. 
</P>
<P>
"The readings are not confined to poets," he said, noting that 10 to 15 people 
of all types usually sign up. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot more poets in Orange County than we think," Logue said. "There 
are hundreds of them in the county and a lot of them are private writers who 
have never shared or published their work." 
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "not many of the poets are located in north Orange County, 
and that's where we are concentrating our efforts." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast with poets in Los Angeles County, who Logue said tend to be 
competitive, there is more of a congenial atmosphere among Orange County poets. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a different attitude in Orange County. They are not part of a 
clique," he said. "It's more of an open, cooperative spirit here." 
</P>
<P>
Logue said he hopes the group flourishes and is eventually able to provide 
scholarships to creative writers. On the other hand, it may not be something he 
stays with forever. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see myself locked into any one thing," he said. "I left home at 16 and 
never looked back. It seems the more creative a person is, the more easily they 
get bored doing the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
And he doesn't plan to change his somewhat colorful exterior. "I remember 
sitting by a fire in a field and this old cowboy told me, 'If you're not 
hurting anyone, do anything you want to do.' I'm not hurting anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Tat Shinno, who has taught, written books and worked as a successful flower

ROBBERY-SLAYING SUSPECT IS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspect in the slaying of a Diamond Bar woman was arrested Tuesday morning at 
a Costa Mesa motel, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Allen David Brooks, 42, is being held in connection with the shotgun murder of 
Belinda Brecke, 31, in a Diamond Bar check-cashing store on Dec. 15, 1988. The 
suspect fled with $10,000 to $15,000, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa Police Lt. Gary Webster alleged that Brooks held up two Orange 
County restaurants Monday and escaped with an undetermined amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
A Costa Mesa patrol officer spotted a Dodge van about 3 a.m. parked outside the 
motel. The vehicle fit the description of a getaway vehicle used in the 
robberies. Police set up a small SWAT team outside of the motel about 6:30 a.m. 
and Brooks surrendered 15 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Police think that Brooks is a transient who lived at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
He remains in custody of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

SUPERVISOR STANTON LENDS HIS NAME TO PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors agreed to name a new 1.4-acre park in unincorporated 
Midway City after Supervisor Roger R. Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
The park, located in Stanton's 1st District, was built in 1987 on land acquired 
by the county from Southern California Edison, Co. The recommendation to name 
the park in Stanton's honor came from the Midway City Chamber of Commerce and 
Homeowner's Assn. The park -- bounded by Bolsa Avenue and Riata, Purdy and 
Washington streets -- includes a 4,000-square-foot community center where 
programs involving hot meals for senior citizens and day care for young 
children are operated.

ATTORNEYS PORTRAY CONFLICTING IMAGES OF GATES' OPPONENT

The spotlight turned to Preston Guillory in federal court Tuesday, with his 
attorneys portraying him as the innocent victim of political harassment by 
Orange County Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates and opposing attorneys painting him as 
a man forced out of law enforcement by his own irresponsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday was the second day of testimony by Guillory, a private investigator who 
is suing Gates and Anaheim officials for $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is in its fourth week in U.S. District Court. Guillory alleges that 
Gates and Anaheim officials drummed up charges that the investigator 
impersonated an officer and illegally carried a concealed weapon because 
Guillory was a critic of Gates and was working for one of Gates' political 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Guillory was eventually found not guilty of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revolver Always Visible 
</P>
<P>
Guillory, questioned by his attorney, Michael J. Cisarik, insisted that at no 
time did he lead anyone to believe he was a law enforcement officer. He said 
that whenever he carried his revolver, it was visible in a holster at his 
waist. He had a permit to carry an unconcealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The charges stemming from a sheriff's investigation were "inconceivable," he 
insisted, but even though he was acquitted in December, 1985, Guillory 
testified Tuesday that he had lost "virtually every client" he had that year 
because of the damage to his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
A previous sworn statement by Guillory showed that his income fell to $21,827 
that year, down 51%. Guillory said it became difficult to pay the rent, and he 
turned to part-time jobs. For 2 months he was unemployed, staying at home, 
watching TV, gaining weight and frequently quarreling with his wife about 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how being unable to provide for his family affected him emotionally, 
Guillory appeared to choke up on the stand and seemed unable to answer. "I have 
two small children," he said after a long pause and apologized. 
</P>
<P>
He said the fear of further harassment has made daily life tense. "My feeling 
is this may not be the end of it," he said. "I will eventually move out of 
Orange County. I just can't see living in this environment, win or lose." 
</P>
<P>
During cross-examination, Eric L. Dobberteen, Gates' attorney, focused on 
Guillory's background, including his resignation under pressure from the Los 
Angeles Sheriff's Department after striking a handcuffed prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
Guillory has testified that while a deputy sheriff in 1969, he arrested a man 
who said he was a martial arts expert. When the man, who was handcuffed behind 
his back, charged Guillory, he struck the man in the hand, said Guillory, who 
insisted that his reaction had been justified. 
</P>
<P>
But under Dobberteen's questioning, Guillory admitted that he had been "held 
liable" for using "excessive force" in the incident after a civil trial. He 
conceded that an internal investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department had been under way when he resigned. 
</P>
<P>
But that was only a "partial factor" in his resignation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Guillory denied that he had been suspended by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department because he had failed to appear in court on a traffic citation he 
had issued. But Dobberteen read from Guillory's previous sworn statements, in 
which he said he had been suspended for not appearing and explained that the 
court date had been his day off. 
</P>
<P>
Guillory conceded that he was also being investigated over allegations that he 
had leaked sheriff's information to the news media when he resigned, but 
Guillory denied that he had disclosed such information. However, Dobberteen 
again read from previous statements in which Guillory said he had given out the 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Gates' attorney also read from a judge's findings in a lawsuit Guillory brought 
against Gates in 1978 in which he sought to force Gates to issue him a permit 
to carry a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, Mason Fenton of Orange County Superior Court, found that Gates was 
too strict in previously denying such permits to any private investigators and 
ordered him not to discriminate against such applicants. 
</P>
<P>
But while Fenton ordered Gates to reexamine Guillory's application, he 
concluded that such a permit is a privilege "and requires of permittees the 
finest exercise of good judgment, restraint and maturity. On the basis of the 
evidence adduced at the trial, this Court has substantial doubts as to the 
qualifications of (Guillory) in each of these regards." 
</P>
<P>
Gates refused to issue the permit a second time, and Guillory has sued again, 
this time in federal court. That suit is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Guillory alleges in the present trial that his criticism of Gates over the gun 
permit issue is one of the reasons Gates has harassed him.

ANAHEIM CITY COUNCIL SCHEDULES VOTE ON SPRINKLER ORDINANCE FOR BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONN JOHNSTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Anaheim City Council voted Tuesday to take the first steps in adopting 
wide-ranging fire ordinances requiring sprinkler systems in 12 older high-rise 
buildings and in new residential and commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will vote next week on whether to formally adopt a high-rise 
sprinkler ordinance. They also set a public hearing for April 4 to consider 
requiring sprinklers in new residential and commercial buildings. San Clemente 
is the only other Orange County city with such an ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Fire Department Chief Jeff Bowman called for the stricter requirements 
after the fire last year at the First Interstate Bank building in Los Angeles 
that killed one person and caused more than $300 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
The bank tower, the tallest building in Los Angeles, was in the process of 
having sprinklers installed. Fire experts say the May 5 blaze would have been 
contained to one room had sprinklers been in place. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the First Interstate fire, Anaheim had the largest number of 
unprotected high-rise buildings in Orange County, including two 11-story towers 
at the Disneyland Hotel. Hotel officials announced last May that they planned 
to install sprinklers within 3 years. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim's ordinance, if adopted next week, would require high-rise buildings 
without sprinklers to be retrofitted. Building owners would also have to file a 
plan of compliance within the first year of the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
A state law enacted in 1974 required fire sprinklers in new buildings at least 
75 feet tall. Anaheim's proposed ordinance would be stricter, requiring 
sprinkler systems as of Jan. 1, 1992, for existing buildings of 55 feet or 
more. A provision would allow owners facing prohibitive expenses for the 
retrofitting, such as asbestos removal, to seek a delay or exemption. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think we ought to wait for a major disaster," Bowman said after the 
vote Tuesday. "I think the need is clear." 
</P>
<P>
To assist owners of the 12 high-rises that would have to be retrofitted with 
sprinklers, city officials are considering a loan package of up to $8 million 
to finance the installation work and required asbestos removal. That program 
would have to be approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Under the second ordinance, sprinkler systems would be required for: 
</P>
<P>
* Newly constructed commercial buildings. Current city law requires them only 
in buildings greater than 6,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
* Apartment and condominium complexes of three or more units. 
</P>
<P>
* New single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
Three sprawling residential ranches under construction in the east Anaheim 
Hills might not be covered under the ordinance. Developers of the more than 
5,000 homes there already have negotiated agreements with the city exempting 
their projects from any new sprinkler requirements. 
</P>
<P>
But City Atty. Jack L. White said Tuesday that although he had not recently 
read those agreements, by law the city usually can impose ordinances related to 
public health and safety. 
</P>
<P>
Franklyn R. Elfend, a representative of the three ranch developers, said that 
his clients are not opposed to the idea of sprinkler systems, but that the city 
had already accepted other fire prevention services instead of sprinklers in 
the development agreements. 
</P>
<P>
"It was something the city could have had at the time (of negotiating the 
agreements) but excluded," Elfend said. He estimated the cost of installing 
sprinklers in the ranch developments at $18 million.

KRAFT JUDGE TO HOLD POST-TRIAL HEARING ON DEFENSE DELAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The judge in the Randy Steven Kraft trial, increasingly impatient with the pace 
of courtroom activity, declared Tuesday that he will hold a hearing after the 
trial is over to determine whether delays by the defense in presenting 
witnesses have been reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
Although Judge Donald A. McCartin did not describe it as a contempt of court 
hearing, that's how Kraft attorney C. Thomas McDonald viewed it. He immediately 
lashed back at the judge. 
</P>
<P>
"This is impacting my ability to effectively and fairly represent Mr. Kraft," 
McDonald told the court. "It's going to reflect on my willingness to vigorously 
represent Mr. Kraft if I feel that the court is threatening me with contempt at 
the end of the case." 
</P>
<P>
Although McDonald was shouting at the judge, he said later that he would 
characterize his demeanor as "assertive" instead of "excited." 
</P>
<P>
"This is an extremely complex case," McDonald said. "We're doing the best we 
can under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, 43, is charged with 16 Orange County murders. But he is accused by 
prosecutors of a total of 45 murders in Southern California, Oregon, and 
Michigan, many of which will be mentioned to the jury if the trial reaches a 
penalty phase. It took Kraft's attorneys 5 years to prepare for trial, a time 
they said they needed to investigate all the deaths attributed to their client. 
</P>
<P>
When the prosecution ended its case in November, the defense was given until 
Jan. 30 to begin presenting witnesses. Since then, they have rarely had enough 
witnesses to keep the court in session a full day. 
</P>
<P>
McCartin expressed irritation Tuesday that jurors were outside the courtroom 
waiting to enter on time at 9:15 a.m., but McDonald wasn't in court because he 
was still interviewing a witness. 
</P>
<P>
The judge complained that the defense has seldom had more than 2 hours of 
testimony a day since it began presenting witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've bent over backwards to be extremely fair," the judge said. "But 
the jury is going to wonder what in the world we are doing. I mean they come in 
at 9:15 in the morning and and have no idea why they are sitting (outside the 
courtroom) until 10 o'clock." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald responded: "Your honor, if you can get somebody else to handle this in 
a more expeditious fashion, I welcome it. Frankly, I'm going as fast as I can 
here." 
</P>
<P>
And the judge responded: "We will put it in the drawer for now. I'm just saying 
that when the end of this case is over, we will have a hearing and see if the 
reasons you stated (for any morning delays) are valid." 
</P>
<P>
Judge McCartin said a citation for contempt would be a possible option if the 
defense explanation turns out to be unsatisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald asked for a mistrial -- the third time he has done so since testimony 
began last September -- but McCartin denied it. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown was quiet during most of this exchange, but 
when the judge asked him if he had anything to say, he let McDonald have it. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is not just getting the defense to start on time in the mornings, 
Brown said. "Once we start, it peters out after a few witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
Brown went on: "I'm having a difficult time believing Mr. McDonald when he says 
that the court's comments are compromising his ability to represent Mr. Kraft. 
That's just got to be a bunch of baloney. The court has not put anywhere near 
the pressure on them that the court has put on the (prosecution). 
</P>
<P>
Brown reminded the judge of his comment when Brown ran out of witnesses one day 
last September about 20 minutes before the normal 4:30 p.m. stopping time. "I 
want those witnesses out there three deep from now on," he told Brown at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"The court hasn't done that to the defense. . . . Yesterday was a good example. 
What did we have, three witnesses yesterday?" Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge countered that he did not want to pressure McDonald on how many 
witnesses he must produce each day because, "I don't want the record to reflect 
I'm trying to put a firecracker to his ear. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, your honor," replied McDonald, "I would say threatening me with contempt 
is a firecracker by my standards."

<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven years ago, as a first-grader at St. John's Lutheran School in Orange, 
Pat Bagatourian stood on his tippy-toes and stared through a window of St. 
John's gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, Orange Lutheran High School's basketball team was hard at work, 
preparing itself for what would become its finest season to date. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the Lancers -- which had no gym of their own and frequently practiced 
at St. John's -- came to be one of Bagatourian's favorite pastimes. Most of his 
attention, though, focused on a particular player, the star of the team, No. 
21, Fred Bagatourian. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother was a big hero to me at a younger age," Pat Bagatourian said. "He's 
not as much anymore. . . . Now, we're just like real close friends." 
</P>
<P>
And close friendly rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bagatourian, now a senior at Orange Lutheran, is about to break one of his 
brother's school records. In the 1977-78 season, Fred Bagatourian shot a 
school-record 60% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Bagatourian, who at 17 is 10 years younger, is shooting 62% -- with one 
game to go. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran (23-3) plays Santa Clara (22-3) in the championship final of 
the Southern Section 2-A playoffs on Saturday. The game, which begins at 10:30 
a.m., will be played at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
For the Bagatourian family, as well as for the Lancer basketball program, Pat 
Bagatourian's success is sweet, and somewhat ironic. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Orange Lutheran made it to a Southern Section championship game 
was in 1978, with Fred Bagatourian leading the way. Eleven years later, Pat has 
plenty to do with the Lancers' success. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, no Orange Lutheran team has won a league championship without a 
Bagatourian on its roster. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, it's ironic," said Fred Bagatourian, a project manager for his father's 
metal fabrication firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Because as I look back at how Pat's developed and had his success, it's ironic 
that the things were the same for me. They won the (Olympic) league his junior 
and senior years, my teams won league my junior and senior years. 
</P>
<P>
"But you really can't pinpoint one ballplayer. They've all worked real hard 
this season." 
</P>
<P>
That work has translated into the best team record in school history. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Bagatourian brothers are often compared at Orange Lutheran, their 
main difference is in position. Fred, who is 5-feet-11, played point guard; 
Pat, 6-2, plays center. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Fred, who made most of his shots from the perimeter, jokingly 
asks that an asterisk be placed next to the field-goal percentage record his 
brother is about to set. 
</P>
<P>
Pat's response? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, he would say that." 
</P>
<P>
According to Orange Lutheran Coach Jerry Simmons, who was head coach when Fred 
Bagatourian was a senior, the strength of both Bagatourians is their intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"Both Pat and his brother have an intense desire to win," Simmons said. "Pat 
maybe a little more so. He plays with a lot of heart." 
</P>
<P>
This was evident throughout the season, but probably most evident in Orange 
Lutheran's more important games. In an early-season game against Capistrano 
Valley, now 23-4 and heading to Saturday's 5-A final, Bagatourian held his own 
inside, scoring 19 points and grabbing 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
And 2 weeks ago, in the Lancers' first-round game against Riverside Notre Dame, 
Bagatourian was double-teamed on the inside against players 6-4 and 6-5. Still, 
he managed 34 points. 
</P>
<P>
Bagatourian, who is averaging 21 points and 11 rebounds a game, says his 
intensity is fueled not so much by the desire to win but the fear of losing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm scared to lose, I'm scared to death of losing," Bagatourian said. "There's 
something about losing, you feel you failed. It's like someone got something 
over you. I hate that feeling. I think I get a lot of that from him (his 
brother)." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it has something to do with a certain memory Bagatourian has of his 
older brother, one he said he will never forget. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most vivid memories I have of him is playing in the Long Beach 
Sports Arena," he said. "I remember it was his senior year, they were in the 
semifinals, and he wanted to win so bad, but they lost. 
</P>
<P>
"But what I remember most is when he came home he went into the bathroom and 
cried. I was about 7 years old, and that was the first time I'd ever seen him 
cry. It must've made a big impression on me. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never wanted to lose since."

Hip and ankle injuries have nagged Mission Viejo High School's Jeff Jurgemeyer 
most of the season. Jurgemeyer, last year's South Coast League offensive soccer 
player of the year with 19 goals, had only four goals going into Tuesday's 
Southern Section 3-A semifinal match against St. Francis. 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday, Jurgemeyer was up to speed, scoring two second-half goals to give 
the top-seeded Diablos a 2-1 victory over fourth-seeded St. Francis. 
</P>
<P>
"It would feel fine one day and then start hurting, but it ended up feeling 
great today," Jurgemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo (22-1-3) advances to the final for the first time. The Diablos 
play Santa Barbara at 8 p.m. Saturday at Gahr High School in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
But for the first 40 minutes, it appeared St. Francis (19-2) was headed for the 
final. The taller, more physical Golden Knights dominated the half. They scored 
9 minutes into the match when Robert Guerrero intercepted a pass meant for 
Diablo goalie Preston Cubel and scored. 
</P>
<P>
"We got caught up in their game of the long ball and trying to control it high 
in the air," Diablo Coach Cal Foster said. "We had to get it on the ground 
where we could work with it." 
</P>
<P>
In the second half the Diablos did just that. 
</P>
<P>
Jurgemeyer took a crossing pass from Andy Wortrich and scored with 20 minutes 
to play to tie the score. He struck again with 6 minutes to play when he took a 
header from Todd Patrick about 25 yards in front of the goal and went 
one-on-one, beating goalie Alex Poli. 
</P>
<P>
In a 4-A semifinal match: 
</P>
<P>
Edison 3, Hawthorne 2 -- Edison scored three second-half goals, two by Brian 
Higgins, and will play Palos Verdes in the final at 8 p.m. Friday at Gahr. 
</P>
<P>
Edison (14-5-3) trailed, 1-0, before Kevin Smith tied the score 27 seconds into 
the second half. Higgins put Edison ahead 10 minutes later and gave the 
Chargers a cushion with 20 minutes to play. Hawthorne is 16-10-2. 
</P>
<P>
In a Small Schools semifinal match: 
</P>
<P>
Morro Bay 2, Whittier Christian 1 -- Host Morro Bay (17-3-2) scored two goals 
in final 9 minutes for the victory. Tom Chausse scored with 9 minutes left to 
tie it, 1-1, and Max Traux scored the winning goal about two minutes later. 
Whittier Christian is 18-4-3.

SCOTT FERGUSON HAS GROWN INTO A CENTER OF ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY NISTA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At one time, there was almost no room for Scott Ferguson in the Whittier 
Christian High School basketball program. When Ferguson was a 6-foot, 170-pound 
freshman, Bob Brown, then freshman coach, stretched the team a little to allow 
him to remain as a third-string center. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach came to me and said, 'We'd like to keep you if you want to practice and 
get better, but you might not get much playing time,' " Ferguson said. "My best 
friends were on the team, so I stayed and stuck with it." 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, after Ferguson stretched seven inches, he found plenty of room 
on the team and in the starting lineup. Now, the senior is preparing to play 
for the Southern Section 2-AA championship against Banning on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Freshman year, I wasn't better than anybody else," Ferguson said. "I tried 
hard to be just as good as them, but I wasn't as coordinated then. 
</P>
<P>
"In between freshman and sophomore years, I grew five inches. I figured I'd be 
totally clumsy and uncoordinated." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he was starting at center on the junior varsity as a sophomore. But it 
took hours under a rusty steel rim in a schoolyard near his home everyday after 
practice, shooting, rebounding and shooting until he attained a touch. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I worked all summer from when the season ended all the way through to the 
next season, just working on my game." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson started as a junior on varsity and was named first team All-Olympic 
League. 
</P>
<P>
"We were thinking of cutting him that first season," said Brown, who is winding 
up his first season as varsity coach. "But he has a good understanding of the 
game and has a good shooting touch for a kid his size." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson averaged 14 points a game on 63% shooting during the regular season to 
lead the Heralds (21-6) to second place in the Olympic League. He has averaged 
20 points in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Scott has played his best basketball of the year in the last four weeks -- the 
last week of the season and the first three weeks of the playoffs -- and that's 
one of the reasons why we're doing well." 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian swept through the first two rounds of the playoffs before 
beating El Segundo, 71-57, in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"So far we've matched up pretty well inside," Brown said. "Banning has some 
size, about 6-2, but their starters are good athletes so they will be playing 
bigger than 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"But I feel good about our inside matchup. (Whittier Christian also has forward 
Paul McKinley, averaging 19 points.) Banning's threat to us is that they have 
some real super quickness and they play a full-court press." 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian can also play a running game. 
</P>
<P>
"During the season, they were packing in the zone," Ferguson said. "A lot of my 
points lately have been coming off the transition, on the break or maybe 
filling in the lane." 
</P>
<P>
But the Heralds are looking to go inside to Ferguson more often. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the problems earlier were that we weren't patient enough to work long 
enough to get Scott the ball," Brown said. "We were relying more on our 
perimeter game than we should have been. His teammates have done a good job of 
getting him the ball in the areas he can score. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very unselfish player. He will pass off when he can't get a shot in the 
post. In fact, that was part of the problem earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"He was probably a little too unselfish. I think there was a lot of times when 
he was catching the ball and looking to pass first. He's been looking to score 
first lately and that's a big help to him and the team."

Newport Harbor High School's Sienna Curci, one of the nation's top girls' 
volleyball players, has signed a national letter of intent to attend California 
next fall, said Charlie Brande, Orange County Volleyball Club coach. 
</P>
<P>
Curci, a 5-foot-5 setter, helped Newport Harbor to the 5-A championship in 
1987. She considered UCLA and Stanford but decided on Cal, where brother Mike,

BUSH AIDE CALLS ON BANKERS TO VIGOROUSLY BACK S&amp;L OVERHAUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The architect of President Bush's plan to rescue struggling savings and loan 
associations urged bankers Tuesday at a convention in Anaheim to "play a major 
role" in supporting the industry overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
Richard C. Breeden, an assistant to the President, told members of the 
Independent Bankers Assn. of America that they should encourage "neighbors, 
customers and your local newspapers" to lobby for swift approval of the 
legislation, which was introduced in Congress last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Losses continue to accrue at $40 million per day while we analyze and debate, 
and a large part of those losses will ultimately be borne by the nation as a 
whole, including banks," Breeden said. 
</P>
<P>
Breeden received a standing ovation from bankers attending the annual 
convention of the nation's second-largest trade organization. But his remarks 
were tempered by B.R. Beeksma, chairman of the U.S. League of Savings 
Institutions, the thrift industry's major trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Following Breeden to the podium, Beeksma said he was encouraged that an S&amp;L 
rescue plan has been proposed, but he cited several troublesome points that he 
said should be corrected before Congress enacts the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
In a later interview, Beeksma termed the bill a "power grab by the Treasury," 
which would oversee the S&amp;L industry's regulatory system and sit on the 
board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. under the Bush program. 
</P>
<P>
"If the bill is adopted as presented, thrifts will die or disappear," Beeksma 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The battle over the bill may indeed become a fight for survival because 
deregulation of the financial industry has already made banks and S&amp;Ls more 
alike. In fact, IBAA members -- primarily smaller institutions that 
collectively form a majority of the nation's 12,000 banks -- are moving more 
aggressively into home mortgage lending, the traditional preserve of S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
The independent bankers generally supported Breeden's proposals, but the 
association has said that it wants some modifications to ensure the 
independence of the FDIC from political pressure and to classify more bank 
liabilities as deposits so that bigger banks would pay more in deposit 
insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
Breeden, however, urged bankers to accept the plan as is and to save any 
changes for later. The need to restructure the industry, raise $50 billion in a 
bond program and increase deposit premiums at banks and S&amp;Ls is too great 
to afford delays, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in a press conference, Breeden said Bush is "not at all" willing to 
compromise on the issue of FDIC oversight, which Breeden said was a key element 
of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would turn the independent Federal Home Loan Bank Board into an agency 
of the U.S. Treasury Department. It also would merge the bank board's Federal 
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. into the FDIC, which would manage S&amp;L 
deposit insurance separately from banking deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, the FDIC's independence would be weakened because the 
reconstituted agency would include the Treasury secretary as a member, bankers 
said. But Breeden told reporters that Bush "owes it to the public" to guarantee 
oversight of the reconstituted FDIC. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has formed a joint task force of banking and S&amp;L regulators to seize 
about 300 insolvent S&amp;Ls nationwide to limit further risk-taking and to 
begin the process of preparing them for sale or closure. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Breeden drew applause for advocating tough tactics against bank 
or S&amp;L operators who "abuse the public trust" through fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"The object here is simple -- to fight fraud and looting of financial 
institutions," he said. "The President is determined to see that those who have 
caused massive losses to American society through criminal wrongdoing will be 
sought out, pursued relentlessly and placed behind bars, where they belong, for 
a long time." 
</P>
<P>
The failures of a fifth to a third of all S&amp;Ls have involved "significant 
amounts of fraud," he said in his press conference. "The President doesn't 
believe ethics should be confined to the public sector. It's both an economic 
and moral matter."

FASTER THAN LAST YEAR;

<P>
AVERAGE SOUTH COUNTY HOUSE SELLS IN 54 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the stories of buyers snatching up houses the moment they hit the 
multiple listings service, the average house took 54 days to sell in the 
southern half of the county last year. 
</P>
<P>
But that was a nearly a week less than the year before, when it took an average 
of 60 days to sell, even though prices were a lot lower. 
</P>
<P>
Those figures are courtesy of Grubb &amp; Ellis Co., which Tuesday released 
some statistics on the 14 markets in which it operates. 
</P>
<P>
The average length of stay on the market, based on figures from local boards of 
Realtors, varied from 84 days in San Juan Capistrano -- one of the south 
county's more expensive markets with an average home price of $409,316 -- to a 
short 32 days in El Toro, one of the least expensive markets with an average 
home price of $161,933. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the highest average prices were found in posh Newport Beach, 
which averaged $560,000 per house last year. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the California Assn. of Realtors reported earlier that the average 
house for the entire county cost $211,402 last year, an increase of 24.9% from 
the $169,277 average in 1987 and the highest increase in the state. 
</P>
<P>
What is driving prices so high and so fast? 
</P>
<P>
Population in Southern California is growing faster than the national average, 
creating more demand, said Dennis W. Macheski, research director for Grubb 
&amp; Ellis in this region. 
</P>
<P>
And while prices are high, the county is affluent and some communities have a 
high proportion of two-income families, Macheski said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Still, demand for housing as seen in home sales is growing at only 3% to 5% a 
year, while prices in some communities grew 30% last year. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the disparity between the two figures, Macheski said, is that 
some buyers were pushed into the market by the fear that local governments will 
restrict new home construction still further. These buyers worry that prices 
will continue to grow until they can no longer afford any house. 
</P>
<P>
Speculators who buy houses while gambling that they will continue to appreciate 
rapidly are also boosting prices, Macheski said. 
</P>
<P>
Used homes should continue to sell briskly this year in Orange County, though 
not quite so rapidly as last year, local Grubb &amp; Ellis executives said. 
</P>
<P>
And prices will not jump 25% on the average, as they did last year. 
</P>
<P>
That outlook for the market matches what other experts have been saying.

BRIEFCASE: SPORTSCLUB, BATTLING BANKRUPTCY, CLOSES ITS STORE IN FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
</P>

<P>
All American SportsClub, a discount sporting goods chain, has closed its 
Fountain Valley store as the company struggles to pull itself out of 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
SportsClub has been operating under Chapter 11 proceedings in U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court in Los Angeles since last March, and it has closed a few of its stores 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Stores in Fountain Valley and Woodland Hills were closed on Sunday. The Burbank 
and Culver City stores were closed earlier. Stores in Sacramento and San 
Bernardino remain open, company employees said. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach-based company has filed a reorganization plan, but a court 
hearing has not yet been scheduled, said Sandra S. Kass, a SportsClub attorney. 
Creditors have discussed the plan, and the company will add some information 
and clarify existing points in the plan, she said. 
</P>
<P>
SportsClub was founded by Robert J. McNulty in 1986, shortly after he sold his 
interest in HomeClub, the Fullerton chain of discount home improvement stores 
that he co-founded. 
</P>
<P>
When he started SportsClub, McNulty said his concept was to apply to sporting 
goods the same no-frills sales techniques that proved so popular in selling 
paint and faucets. His plan was to undercut the prices of his competition by 
25% to 30% by selling directly out of high-ceiling, cement-floor warehouses 
with large volumes of inventory. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for SportsClub said McNulty was out of town and unavailable for 
comment Tuesday. JAMES S. GRANELLI

FACING A DIVORCE? DON'T OVERLOOK TAXES; 
</P>
<P>
GOOD ADVISER IS A MUST AND CAN PROBABLY SAVE BOTH PARTIES MONEY 
</P>

<P>
When a couple faces divorce, the spouses usually end up talking to their real 
estate brokers, their children's teachers, their psychologists and their 
lawyers before it's all over. 
</P>
<P>
The one professional not on that list who should be is their accountant or tax 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Divorce, besides being an emotional trauma, is a taxable event. And the lawyers 
who are so good at hand holding, at securing court dates and working out 
custody disputes may know next to nothing about the finances of dividing 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Any couple with substantial property who are going through a divorce should 
call in a financial planner or accountant to consult on the case, if their 
lawyers do not. A sensible and tax-driven approach to the division of assets 
can save both partners money in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Forster is a financial planner recently divorced from another financial 
planner. The couple were able to put emotions aside, and together wrote a 
divorce settlement on their own and took it to the lawyers for review. 
</P>
<P>
Forster now works as a consultant to a divorce attorney, using her planning 
skills to divide property in an equitable manner. She advises anyone going 
through a divorce to spend some time and money showing the property settlement 
to a financial expert. 
</P>
<P>
Forster and Bethesda, Md., financial planner David Drucker listed examples of 
the financial aspects of divorce on which attorneys all too frequently do not 
concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
* Couples over 55 get a one-time $125,000 exclusion from capital gains taxes on 
the sale of their residence. If the couple uses that exclusion before they 
divorce, neither can ever use the exclusion again with a subsequent spouse. 
</P>
<P>
So new marriage partners for either spouse would be prohibited from ever using 
the exclusion, if they have not already. If they have not lived in the home for 
at least 3 of the last 5 years, they can lose the exclusion too. 
</P>
<P>
* When one spouse deeds the house over to the other, the recipient also 
inherits the original basis that the couple has in the house. That means that 
when one wants to sell the house in the future, he or she will have to pay tax 
on all of the appreciation on the home's value, even the appreciation that 
occurred while the couple were still married. 
</P>
<P>
If, instead, one spouse buys out the other's share of the house, he or she will 
have a higher basis for that share when it comes time to calculate capital 
gains taxes on its sale. 
</P>
<P>
"This can be either an opportunity or a trap," Drucker said. "It's best to 
figure these things out on an after-tax basis to make the benefits more 
equitable." 
</P>
<P>
* There are planning opportunities in a divorce: One spouse can transfer his or 
her Individual Retirement Accounts to the other without subjecting those 
accounts to taxes. A working spouse can buy a life insurance policy, name the 
ex-spouse as beneficiary, and deduct the premiums as alimony. 
</P>
<P>
* Pension and Social Security issues are getting progressively more 
complicated. A non-working spouse who has been married for 10 years is entitled 
to half the Social Security benefits of the working spouse, as well as a 
portion of the working spouse's pension. But the distribution of that plan can 
have tax consequences and is very difficult to evaluate in current dollar 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
* Many courts now put values on professional degrees. So if one spouse put the 
other through medical school or law school, there are ways to calculate what 
that support was worth, in terms of future potential earnings. 
</P>
<P>
* The decision on how to construct alimony is crucial. Alimony can be 
deductible to the payer and taxable to the payee, so the person receiving the 
alimony ought to be clear up front about whether the payer is planning to 
deduct it. 
</P>
<P>
If the alimony is being paid by an individual in a high tax bracket to one in a 
low bracket, taxing the alimony can save money for both. 
</P>
<P>
Spouses can forgo alimony in favor of a non-taxable lump-sum payment, but if it 
is high enough, say $15,000 or more, the Internal Revenue Service can question 
the non-taxable nature of the payment. 
</P>
<P>
* Child support disguised as alimony or alimony disguised as child support, 
which is never taxable or deductible, can raise IRS eyebrows as well and is 
best avoided. 
</P>
<P>
* Spouses can ask for alimony based on a percentage of earnings rather than as 
a fixed amount, but not, both Drucker and Forster point out, if the payer has 
control over his or her own income. 
</P>
<P>
* Finally, payments for financial or legal advice on the tax issues that come 
up in divorce cases are tax deductible, even though other divorce counseling is 
not.

THE GUMBEL RUMBLE: HIS MEMO IRKS CAST, CREW OF 'TODAY' SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
NBC's "Today" show is first in morning ratings, but there were grumblings 
aplenty Tuesday -- including an unusually strong blast from NBC News President 
Michael Gartner -- because of a confidential memo in which co-anchor Bryant 
Gumbel ripped the program's on- and off-camera staff. 
</P>
<P>
Only co-anchor Jane Pauley escaped unscathed. She wasn't mentioned in Gumbel's 
memo, which took hard whacks at weatherman Willard Scott, criticized film 
critic Gene Shalit's critiques and interviews, and called consumer reporter 
David Horowitz "a walking cliche." 
</P>
<P>
Gumbel, who joined the program in 1982 and recently signed a new NBC pact that 
reportedly will pay him $7 million over the next three years, was said to be on 
vacation until Monday and was not available for comment. Correspondent Stephen 
Frazier is substitute-anchoring for him this week. 
</P>
<P>
An NBC spokesman said Gumbel's four-page memo was written last September to 
"Today" executive producer Marty Ryan in response to Ryan's request for 
Gumbel's analysis of the program, which was then in Seoul for the Summer 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan declined Tuesday to discuss the memo itself but said his request for 
Gumbel's thoughts about the show wasn't unusual. He periodically seeks views on 
the program from other on-air staffers and producers, he said. "It's not always 
done at the same time, but it is part of an on-going process," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gartner, in a memo of his own to staffers, said the 5-month-old Gumbel memo 
was "ancient history" and was "apparently stolen out of Gumbel's computer file 
and then given by an NBC employee" to a reporter for Newsday, which disclosed 
the memo's contents Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"That, quite simply, is theft," Gartner said. "It won't be tolerated. Anyone 
who steals will be fired." 
</P>
<P>
Gumbel wrote that "Today" needed more background reports on politics and a 
segment on videocassettes, and fired several shots at the flamboyant, 
high-spirited Scott. 
</P>
<P>
The weatherman, Gumbel wrote, "holds the show hostage to his assortment of 
whims, wishes, birthdays and bad taste." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Scott should be bumped from the show's first half hour, which 
usually has more hard news content than the rest of the program. The weatherman 
will be angered, Gumbel wrote, but "so what. . . . He can't leave this job and 
couldn't get a better one." 
</P>
<P>
Scott was not available for comment Tuesday. His office said he was busy at a 
taping. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz said Tuesday, "The rest of the memo was very positive about my work." 
He said Gumbel has kidded him to his face "about being 'the cliche of 
consumerism,' " but he takes that as a compliment. 
</P>
<P>
The Gumbel memo was written in response to producer Ryan's request for "a frank 
exchange of opinion," NBC spokesman Curt Block said. "It was an internal memo 
not meant for publication. It hasn't resulted in any changes on the show." 
</P>
<P>
Gartner, in his memo, noted that "this is a business of creative people, and if 
we can't be open and honest, if we can't exchange views without having memos 
stolen and half-stories leaked and cheap shots taken anonymously, then we all 
have a big problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the handful of you who are stirring this pot, a cowardly and disloyal 
handful, will think about the long-term damage you're causing." 
</P>
<P>
Gartner told staffers that he had spoken with Gumbel and others on the show 
Tuesday and reaffirmed his own pleasure in its success and his belief in candid 
discussions "to make us even better." 
</P>
<P>
A number of "Today" staff members were upset by Gumbel's comments, a source 
close to the situation said, adding, "I think the reaction is predictable." 
</P>
<P>
But film critic Shalit, who has been on "Today" longer than its other on-air 
personnel, said the memo didn't bother him, even though it called his reviews 
"often late" and said his interviews with film stars "aren't very good." 
</P>
<P>
Shalit said Gumbel's memo is old, that "he wrote it at an entirely different 
time in his life and of the show's life, and it's old news and meaningless, as 
far as I'm concerned." 
</P>
<P>
He shrugged off Gumbel's criticism of him. 
</P>
<P>
"Aw, they're not big whacks. . . . Listen, I've been interviewing people on the 
show for 17 years. I must be doing something right."

L.A. ARTISTS PACK 1ST MEETING ON CITY'S $20-MILLION ENDOWMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusually strong show of local art world activism, a standing-room-only 
crowd of artists packed a theater in Hollywood Monday night to voice concerns 
over how the new $20-million Los Angeles Endowment for the Arts is spent. 
</P>
<P>
Clapping and cheering, about 350 artists and arts administrators -- sitting in 
the aisles and leaning against the walls -- gathered at Barnsdall Park's 
Gallery Theatre for the first "town meeting" of the Los Angeles Arts Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The congress is an ad hoc organization formed by local artists to involve the 
arts community in shaping the endowment, a $20-million city arts program slated 
to be fully operational in about a year. City officials are now developing 
endowment guidelines through various studies and by attending such meetings as 
Monday's. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't (ever) seen this many people for an event like this," said Los 
Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs, who conceived of the endowment, designed to 
benefit all disciplines, cultures, large and small groups and independent 
artists citywide. "I guess that's what happens when you have $20 million to 
give out." 
</P>
<P>
Monday's multi-ethnic crowd, even bigger than the one that jammed City Council 
chambers last November for the endowment's passage, was clearly grass roots, 
composed mostly of independent artists and administrators from small arts 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
Lining up to speak at an "open mike," 52 people urged Wachs, Al Nodal (general 
manager of the city's Cultural Affairs Department and chief endowment 
administrator) and other officials to use endowment funds for everything from 
inner-city youth arts programs to affordable dance, music and theater venues, 
to psychiatric counseling for artists. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see some of this money used to set up theater programs all around 
the inner city for young people," said actor Orlando Bonner. He and others said 
the traditionally "undersupported" black arts community should receive more 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure that the endowment guidelines are set up to include women 
and make sure they are fairly represented," said Jean Towgood, president of the 
Southern California Women's Caucus for Art. 
</P>
<P>
"The Wallenboyd Theatre and Variety Arts Center have gone under," said Brent 
Morris of the Rough Theater, echoing numerous concerns about affordable 
performance and exhibition venues. "The city needs to take a lead in keeping 
organizations like these in operation." 
</P>
<P>
"So many of the poets in L.A. publish their own collections," said Carrie 
Etter, one of several poets who spoke up for support for poetry publishing 
houses and publications. 
</P>
<P>
Bemoaning what a colleague called the "virus of isolation endemic to Los 
Angeles," performance artist Tim Miller urged support for programs that 
encourage an "intercultural" community that fuses the city's diverse cultures 
and communities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not enough to fund black theater, Latino theater and gay and lesbian 
programs" separately while "keeping us in our own little fiefdoms," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And decrying a lack of comprehensive medical insurance coverage for artists, 
born of a national "lack of respect" for art, actress Veronica Redd said to 
some laughter and loud applause: "I need counseling and I think every artist in 
this country needs counseling, but (my) insurance will not cover counseling." 
</P>
<P>
Nodal and other city officials have repeated publicly that the endowment is 
designed to support many of the projects and areas of concern addressed at the 
three-hour meeting. But Nodal, who took notes during the session, said he is 
"committed to working with groups like this on an ongoing basis." At least two 
other meetings to discuss the endowment, organized separately from the Los 
Angeles Arts Congress, have been scheduled during March. 
</P>
<P>
A planning session to arrange the next general meeting of the arts congress has 
been scheduled for 8 p.m. Wednesday, April 5, at Gorky's Cafe, 536 E. 8th St., 
downtown Los Angeles. It is open to anyone but an R.S.V.P. is necessary: (213) 
221-4094.

NO FRILLS, NO GLITZ -- ALL BUSINESS AT U.S. FILM MARKET 
</P>

The Toxic Avenger paces the hotel room like the caged creature he is. If this 
were Cannes, he could wander the streets frightening unsuspecting -- OK, 
suspecting -- film buffs. He might even be seen in front of cameras on the 
beach, or leading a morning aerobics class. 
</P>
<P>
But this is not the Cannes Film Festival in the South of France. This is the 
American Film Market at the Beverly Hilton. And the costumed Toxic Avenger is 
not permitted to leave the hotel room assigned to his creator, Troma Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as much fun," says Michael Herz, co-founder with fellow Yale graduate 
Lloyd Kaufman of Troma, which has developed a little niche at the world's film 
market with titles like "Surf Nazis Must Die," "The Toxic Avenger" and, this 
year's big seller, "Rabid Grannies." 
</P>
<P>
Strip away Cannes' glitz and gimmicks, and the 9-year-old American Film Market 
looks a lot like its French competitor. Together with a third festival in 
Milan, these are the world's biggest movie swap meets -- where producers try to 
sell their films to theaters, cable and satellite services and TV stations 
around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the accounting firm of Peat Marwick for the 
American Film Market, the U.S. market surpassed Cannes and Milan last year in 
the volume of business conducted. The survey reports that 33% of sales in the 
international market were negotiated or closed at the American event in 1988. 
During its first four days this year, the market drew 249 selling companies -- 
up 11% over the same period last year -- and 1,838 individual buyers, up 17%, 
according to the market's executive director, Tim Kittleson. 
</P>
<P>
The American market is also subject to the same vagaries as its French and 
Italian counterparts. This year, sellers are notably picky: Most of them want 
films with big stars and big budgets. "We're not seeing huge volumes of product 
being bought, but you're seeing people paying the price for quality titles," 
says Andy Birchall, a buyer for British Satellite Broadcasting's movie channel. 
</P>
<P>
But the American market isn't likely to ever become another Cannes -- in part 
by design. The Americans eschew Cannes' glitz, and its renowned film 
competition, both of which ensure that Hollywood's biggest players -- including 
chief executives of the major studios, powerful talent agents and stars -- will 
at least stop by the festival for a few sets of tennis. 
</P>
<P>
The American Film Market remains largely the territory of U.S. independents and 
a range of foreign companies -- most of which want to conduct their business 
outside the glare of camera lights. No paparazzi here. Just 350 reporters, in 
contrast to some 2,500 who pour into Cannes each May. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have bare-breasted starlets," says market president Jonas Rosenfield. 
"The purpose of the (American Film Market) is to have a serious business 
market." Until recently the market imposed tight restrictions on parties, 
concerned that bigger companies would upstage their competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The market's organizers do have a few frills to offer, including an opening 
bash Friday night in which 3,700 people cavorted in a closed-off parking 
structure at the Beverly Center mall. The weeklong market prompted dozens of 
other parties around town, including a huge Monday morning champagne breakfast 
hosted by talent agency ICM, at which agency chairman Jeff Berg attacked 
Ayatollah Khomeini's death threats against Salman Rushdie, author of the "The 
Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the rights to major films like "Platoon" and "The Last Emperor" 
have been offered at the American market alongside hundreds of low-budget films 
expected to disappear after a few years on the video shelves in countries like 
Japan or Brazil. This year buyers say they are hard-pressed so far to name 
titles that are generating much enthusiasm. "I don't sense any must-haves out 
there," says Birchall. That assessment may change, though, as screenings of new 
films continue this week. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no doubt that this year's buyers are fussier. Fresh from a meeting 
with Japanese buyers -- the largest foreign contingent at the market -- New 
Line Cinema International president Rolf Mittweg notes that Japan, now facing 
overstocked videocassette stores, is in the market for quality films. "It used 
to be that the Japanese came in here with their checkbooks and didn't even look 
at what the pictures were," Mittweg says. "They bought them up like socks." 
</P>
<P>
That's good news for New Line, whose "Nightmare on Elm Street 4" was a hit in 
U.S. theaters last fall and continues to do brisk business overseas. "Buyers 
are willing to step up to higher prices for companies with higher profile A 
pictures," says New Line chief executive Bob Shaye. 
</P>
<P>
This week Mittweg, who speaks several languages, is meeting with buyers in the 
company's hotel suite at the film market. His strategy is to persuade buyers 
interested in the next "Nightmare" installment to also purchase several 
lesser-known New Line films as part of a package. 
</P>
<P>
That's not all New Line has up its sleeve: Mittweg has a boxful of Freddy 
Krueger paraphernalia -- T-shirts, toys, watches -- to show buyers how retail 
stores in their countries can help turn the film's creepy star into a national 
phenomenon. Mittweg even provides advice on setting up Freddy fan clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite most buyers' search for proven box-office hits, some small exploitation 
films are still popular. "There remains that basic market for low-budget genre 
films," says market president Rosenfield. Companies like Troma, he said, "are 
doing very nicely because those pictures have a cult audience." 
</P>
<P>
One key to survival is to make movies suitable to show on television as well as 
in theaters. Europe has experienced a proliferation of TV stations as the 
airwaves move into private hands, and satellites in Britain offer film 
producers a whole new outlet for their product. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an insatiable need for product for TV," says Troma's Herz. Ever 
sensitive to the changing winds of the market, Troma produces a TV version of 
films like "The Toxic Avenger, Part II," designed to pass the tests of even the 
toughest censors. "For example," Herz explains, "we'll do a cover scene where 
the arm is not ripped off."

FORUM URGES GLOBAL DEFENSE OF ART HERITAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Times Art Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From pollution problems of global proportions to regional concern with 
crumbling adobe, from the effects of tourism on ancient monuments to the 
ravages of sunlight on contemporary murals, a high-level forum on art 
conservation, held Monday at the County Museum of Art, hammered away on threats 
to the world's cultural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Ignorance, indifference, technology, pollution, ideological fervor, mass 
tourism, armed conflict and a misguided "zeal for knowledge" that wipes out the 
past in the course of studying it -- these were the culprits ticked off by 
Federico Mayor Zaragoza, director general of UNESCO, in his introductory speech 
at "Collections, Monuments and Architecture at Risk: A Forum for Southern 
California Decision Makers." 
</P>
<P>
Architect Frank Gehry added urban development to the list of villains as he 
flashed a rapid succession of slides of historic Los Angeles buildings that 
have been demolished. 
</P>
<P>
Natural disasters have also done their part to destroy bastions of culture, as 
Luis Monreal, director of the Getty Conservation Institute, pointed out in 
slides of the 1966 flood in Florence that damaged museums and ruined artworks 
throughout the city. Monreal also spoke of the fire set by an unknown arsonist 
in 1986 that devastated the Los Angeles Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
Impermanent pigments, too much light and general neglect have ruined a set of 
Mark Rothko's paintings at a Harvard University faculty center, said Richard 
Koshalek, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art, in his presentation to 
the 100 or so cultural and corporate leaders who gathered at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Preusser, program director for scientific research at the Getty 
Conservation Institute, delivered the depressing news that Los Angeles' air 
contains more than 140 pollutants. And, according to a recent survey, Southern 
California museums filter out as little as 20% of these impurities. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the trouble is man-made, the speakers repeatedly emphasized. The 
species that "fouls its nest most successfully is man," concluded Franklin D. 
Murphy, director emeritus and former chairman and chief executive officer of 
Times Mirror Co., parent company of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The message was grim, but the mood was determinedly hopeful. Far from 
proclaiming "Apocalypse Now," the speakers sounded an alarm that amounted to a 
call for action. 
</P>
<P>
"The question today is, can we save our cultural heritage?" Monreal asked, 
early in the conference. Considering the quickening pace of destruction cited 
by Monreal -- some cultural monuments such as Greece's Parthenon or Egypt's 
Sphinx have suffered more damage in the 20th Century than in the previous 
millennium -- the response to his query seemed inevitably negative. 
</P>
<P>
But after 10 speakers had addressed various aspects of the issue, the 
collective answer was, "We must." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is enormous, the speakers agreed. Even in the United States, the 
world's richest country, the majority of museums don't have professional 
conservators and there are only about 70 scientists working on art conservation 
in the entire nation, Preusser noted. 
</P>
<P>
In developing countries the situation is much worse. "Priorities necessarily 
lie elsewhere when a square meal and a roof are still uncertain for millions of 
people," Mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
How, then, does a group of 100 "decision makers" convened in Los Angeles effect 
solutions? 
</P>
<P>
Americans can do two things: contribute money and "clean up the mess they 
make," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor pointed out that UNESCO has been "at the forefront of the worldwide 
conservation movement." It has "mustered international support" for major 
conservation projects at Abu Simbel, Egypt; Venice, Italy and Carthage, 
Tunisia, he said, and it has established practical "doctrines" in the World 
Heritage Convention, an agreement on environmental protection and cultural 
preservation signed by 109 countries. 
</P>
<P>
Working both with governments and private organizations such as the Getty 
Conservation Institute in Malibu, UNESCO is "a facilitator," "an experimenter," 
"a clearinghouse," "an innovator," "a bridge" and "a catalyst" for 
conservation, Mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
Giovanni Agnelli, keynote speaker and chairman of the Italian auto-making giant 
Fiat, argued for corporate responsibility and provided an impressive example of 
"private initiative" when he showed slides of Fiat's $12-million conversion of 
Palazzo Grassi, an 18th-Century residence in Venice, into an art museum. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he justified such a large expenditure to shareholders who would 
prefer a dividend, Agnelli said it was easy to argue in favor of such long-term 
cultural "investments." In the case of Palazzo Grassi, Fiat revitalized part of 
Italy's "monumental legacy" to serve "artistic objectives" and promote the 
nation's "cultural activities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor said that conservation projects are a special joy to UNESCO, in part 
because they are "visible." But the benefits go deeper than newspaper pictures 
of restored monuments that illustrate UNESCO's work. In the poorest, most 
hopeless countries, "magnificent masterpieces bring self-esteem" to people who 
are desperate for it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the participants have large corporate or government resources at their 
disposal, but they were called together in the belief that a few committed, 
well-placed people can make a difference. The event was organized by the 
National Committee to Save America's Cultural Collections and funded by the 
Ahmanson Foundation, AT&amp;T and the Times Mirror Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Forum chairman Lloyd E. Cotsen said he called the meeting "to create a sense of 
awareness of the problem" and "set up a network of people who will allocate 
resources to it." Introducing himself as a "soap salesman," Cotsen, the 
president of Neutrogena Corp., asked participants to fill out questionnaires to 
be compiled in a sort of "white-collar pages" of resources for conservation. 
"We want you to be available when you are needed. Be an advocate," he urged. 
</P>
<P>
As the meeting wound down, the clearest theme that had emerged was the need for 
a cooperative effort -- one that involves public and private sectors, ignores 
national boundaries and persuades the haves to help the have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a global village. More than that, we are a global culture. The 
Renaissance didn't advantage Italians only," said Murphy. "We owe much to 
Greece, to Rome, to Egypt, to China, and we have an obligation to pay something 
back." 
</P>
<P>
"Our cultural heritage is the most vivid record of how people lived and died," 
Monreal said. "If we don't take our cultural heritage out of the twilight zone, 
if we don't move quickly, tomorrow will be too late and there will be no future 
for our past."

PSYCHIATRISTS TREATING FEWER SOVIET PATIENTS

A panel of physicians said Tuesday that Soviet psychiatrists are treating fewer 
patients under new laws to guard against abuses in institutions long accused of 
being used to hold dissidents against their will. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet doctors, addressing a news conference, also said they are doing 
their utmost to cooperate with a team of U.S. doctors here to assess the 
current state of Soviet psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team, which arrived last weekend, says it has been granted access to 
any patients or institutions it wishes to visit during an unprecedented 
two-week mission. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet laws on psychiatry underwent sweeping changes last year in response to 
allegations that institutions were being used to incarcerate dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enforced Treatment 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet panel said there were about 5.5 million mental patients throughout 
the Soviet Union, most of them suffering neurotic disorders. Caseloads, they 
said, are down by about 30%. 
</P>
<P>
"We want enforced treatment reduced to a minimum," said Vladimir Tikhonenko, 
chief Moscow psychiatrist, referring to cases where incarceration is imposed 
because of violations of the law. 
</P>
<P>
"Optional (voluntary) treatment must be increased. People must not be afraid of 
psychiatrists. We need a situation where anyone can apply if he needs treatment 
and that means having to undergo serious restructuring." 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Yegorov, head of the psychiatric and addiction section of the Soviet 
Health Ministry, said doctors are trying to reduce the number of people on 
mental health registers. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot expect change overnight," he said. "Our aim is to confine required 
treatment to those who are a threat to themselves or to those around them." 
</P>
<P>
Control of special hospitals was transferred last year to the Health Ministry 
from the Interior Ministry and 2 million people were struck off mental patient 
registers. Rulings were issued to protect citizens against abuse and 
malpractices.

BUSH NOMINATES PARNELL FOR USDA POST 
</P>

<P>
President Bush on Tuesday nominated rancher Jack Parnell, California's top 
farming official, to be deputy Secretary of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Parnell, 53, is the first Californian chosen for a high level job in the Bush 
Administration. If confirmed by the Senate, he will serve as chief deputy to 
Agriculturre Secretary Clayton Yeutter. 
</P>
<P>
The nomination ends weeks of speculation over whether the post would go to a 
westerner, such as Parnell, or another leading candidate from the South. 
California is the nation's top-ranking agricultural state. 
</P>
<P>
Parnell, director of the California Department of Food and Agriculture since 
1987, said in an interview that he was delighted with the nomination, 
particularly because of his longtime friendship with Yeutter. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been an admirer of his work," Parnell said. "I certainly have no other 
agenda than to be going back (to Washington) to be the best deputy secretary I 
could be, a team member." 
</P>
<P>
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, 
called Parnell a "tremendously qualified individual." 
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely gratified that the President has chosen to name a Californian 
to the number two spot at the Department of Agriculture," Wilson said. "I know 
Jack's nomination will be met with great support here in Congress, and 
especially among those of us from California." 
</P>
<P>
Parnell, who now lives in Auburn, was born in the state of Washington but grew 
up on a dairy farm just outside Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
A former pedigree livestock auctioneer and agriculture magazine editor, Parnell 
began to raise cattle at the age of 10 and continues to ranch and farm more 
than 4,000 acres east of the state capital. He also owns and operates a 
restaurant, a meat shop, a golf course and is chairman of the board of a 
three-branch bank in the Sierra foothills. 
</P>
<P>
Parnell, who is married and has three children, said he plans to turn his 
businesses over to his children if he is confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
A Republican, Parnell supported Gov. George Deukmejian in his first campaign 
for the governorship.

Soviet authorities have allowed the opening of a second Jewish cultural center, 
this time in the city of Leningrad, the World Jewish Congress announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Permission for the new center, which will include a library and offer Hebrew 
classes, was given after the opening of a Jewish cultural center in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The two projects reflect the growing liberalization of Kremlin policies toward 
the Jewish minority in the Soviet Union, which for many years was repressed and 
prevented from practicing its religion and from learning Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
The Leningrad center will be housed in the city's main synagogue, the Jewish 
congress said.

I have to respond to the article regarding the L.A. Police Department's 
monitoring of where the homeless "live" (Metro, Feb. 10). I will respond from a 
father's point of view, and a policeman's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
After Christmas, my two daughters had money burning holes in their pockets 
(ages 16 and 11). They wanted me to take them downtown to shop, having heard 
what great deals were to be found in the garment district. We parked our car 
and began our journey. We hadn't walked one block, when we came upon a 
30-year-old man, urinating on Olympic Boulevard. He didn't have to drop his 
pants. He had none. 
</P>
<P>
Enough said from a father's point of view. Now from a cop's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers have many jobs. We usually are forced to take action when 
society fails. Well, society has failed in the handling of the homeless. You 
can blame whomever you want: city, county or the federal government. Something 
has got to be done. But the fact remains, no one does anything, so the 
"problem" falls into the laps of police officers. Until funding for the 
homeless and mentally ill improves, the problem will not go away. And cops will 
appear to be the bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, we won't go shopping downtown again real soon.

RIGHT CANDIDATE FOR ENERGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America's most important energy challenge is finding ways to keep the machinery 
of industrial societies humming without destroying the global environment. But 
for the moment, unfortunately, that important work must be put on the back 
burner, yielding precedence to the urgent job of cleaning up the mess at 
America's nuclear warhead factories. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, President Bush seems to have found the right person for both jobs. 
His nomination of retired Adm. James D. Watkins as U.S. secretary of energy 
ranks as one of his most confidence-building appointments. And it is reassuring 
to have the admiral say that he will not forget broader energy issues while he 
tackles the deadly pollutants that have piled up around warhead plants for 45 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department was created in 1977 to stop waste, promote energy sources 
that could take the place of oil and generally make Americans more aware of 
their precarious dependence on imports. Its focus, sharpened by the 1973 Saudi 
oil embargo and tested in the 1979 shut-off of oil supplies by Iran, was 
blurred during the Reagan Administration by an insistence that the market place 
would make everything all right. What the marketplace has produced at the 
beginning of the Bush Administration is a deterioration in energy efficiency in 
the United States much graver than that for other industrial nations. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 years of making better use of energy to fuel American growth and 
production, efficiency flattened out two years ago and dropped last year. In 
1986 every $1 increase in the gross national product took 25% less energy than 
it had in 1976. Now that trend has stopped. U.S. reliance on imported oil is 
climbing sharply, exposing the nation to an increasing risk of blackmail by 
embargo. Washington has stopped reminding Americans that wasting energy could 
mean trouble. Even automobile fuel-efficiency standards were relaxed so that 
Detroit could build more high-powered, high-profit, gas-guzzling cars. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins said during his confirmation hearings last week that his first priority 
would be turning around the culture of complacency in government and industry 
that let much of the machinery of the country's nuclear weapons system rot 
away. He also must supervise an expensive cleanup of toxic waste that the 
complacency culture allowed to ooze into land and water around its facilities. 
</P>
<P>
But he also seemed intent on keeping an eye on the back burner, where issues 
simmer that will remain crucial to the nation's survival even if the 
nuclear-weapons problems is resolved. And he got into enough detail to make 
clear that he wants to find ways to use nuclear power that are less haphazard, 
less dangerous, than the ones the United States has followed since the 1940s. 
He would try to accelerate domestic oil production and look for less polluting 
ways to use coal to reduce oil imports. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins demonstrated as chairman of the Presidential Commission on the Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus, that he has a long, broad perspective on the national 
interest that goes well beyond simple patriotism. His Navy training and career 
demonstrated his expertise, including in energy matters. He may never be in a 
better position to put his experience and judgment to good use.

This could be, and should be, the year of the lion in California, with passage 
of legislation that would spare the state's mountain lion population from sport 
hunters who have one basic desire: to have the stuffed head of a big cat 
displayed on a wall at home. Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Panorama City) is 
correct when he says that shooting these animals for fun is outrageous. 
"Frankly, just this kind of mentality is why we only see the grizzly bear on 
the California state flag," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Katz is sponsoring a bill to reclassify mountain lions from game animals to 
specially protected mammals that could be killed only by permit when they 
damage or destroy livestock or threaten lives. The Katz bill also would 
appropriate $15 million annually to buy land that is natural habitat for the 
elusive lions, for deer and for endangered or threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
The status of the lion is somewhat in limbo after a long moratorium on sport 
hunting of the animal expired in 1986. The state Fish and Game Commission 
scheduled lion hunts in each of the last two years, but fortunately the hunts 
were halted by lawsuits. A bill sponsored by Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside) 
to extend the moratorium passed the Legislature, but was vetoed by Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
State fish and game officials have argued that the lion has made a comeback 
after its numbers dwindled over the years at the hands of professional hunters 
and trappers, and as development encroached on the cat's natural territory. But 
private animal experts have questioned the department's estimate that there now 
are as many as 6,000 cats in the state. They believe the number is far smaller 
than that. While the lion is not officially listed as a threatened or 
endangered species, the sad fact is that it is too late for some species by the 
time officials get around to affording them official protection. That must not 
happen with the mountain lion in California.

AFGHANISTAN REFUGEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was very pleased to see Mark Fineman's piece on Afghan refugee women fighting 
for equal rights (Part I, Feb. 12). 
</P>
<P>
I was in Peshawar in June of last year as the only female member of the 
Citizens Commission for Afghan Refugees and visited Tajwar Kakar at her school. 
I talked to the brave young teen-age girls who told me they hope to return to 
Afghanistan and be "judges, engineers, pilots and doctors." Their country needs 
them desperately, since the illiteracy rate of women is well over 90%. 
</P>
<P>
It was my visit with Tajwar Kakar and dinner with her impressive family which 
helped me to realize how poorly the Afghan refugee women have been served by 
the international aid agencies during their 10 years as refugees in Pakistan. 
Mrs. Kakar runs the only school for young Afghan women refugees in Pakistan. It 
exists solely because of her energy in founding it, and not because the 
international organizations made a conscientious effort to support education 
for young Afghan women. It was a joy to meet the young women who were thriving 
in her school. 
</P>
<P>
One month ago, a group of women, who were concerned that too much planning and 
program funding were taking place without a perspective on the needs of women, 
formed the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children. It will exist to 
see that when programs are funded for the refugees as they return to 
Afghanistan, money is set aside to educate women to enable them to participate 
as literate citizens in their society. 
</P>
<P>
Even as you read this, Dr. Cynthia Haq of the Dartmouth Medical School faculty 
is making the first survey visit on behalf of the Women's Commission in 
Peshawar. She will meet with the international agencies to find out how the 
billions for rebuilding Afghanistan will be spent. And hopefully when she 
returns the Women's Commission will join her in seeing that the brave Afghan 
women who have suffered in exile will not be denied their human rights on their 
return to Afghanistan.

PERFECT AMMUNITION FOR CHARACTER ASSASSINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE F. WILL, George F. Will is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. Tim Wirth (D-Colo.) voted against John Tower in the Armed Services 
Committee because, although there is no "smoking gun," the ground is covered 
with "empty cartridges." And Wirth worries that rumors (cartridges?) of Tower's 
"womanizing" set an "example" that might cause women in the military to be 
"discriminated against." 
</P>
<P>
Wirth will not talk about specifics because that would be "unfair." We know 
everyone is trying to be fair. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the allegations, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) stresses quantity over 
quality. He voted against Tower because the "allegations" (cartridges?) come 
"from a great many unconnected sources." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Dixon (D-Ill.), another quantity man, is impressed that "the 
firestorm of allegations" has not stopped. Many allegations are, he says, 
merely "rumors and innuendo," but (read this carefully) "other allegations 
offer cause for considerable alarm." Does Dixon think they are true? All he 
says is: "There may not be a smoking gun, but there is an abundance of smoke." 
Smoking cartridges, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) says the "effectiveness" of an officeholder depends on 
"perceptions" and in Tower's case, "They may not be fair -- I agree with that 
-- may not be fact. But the perceptions are there." Thus a confirmation process 
that began purporting to pursue the truth ends by declaring the truth 
irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sen. John Breaux (D-La.) explains that we are witnessing senatorial 
idealism: "We ought to be looking for the very best we can find in the nation. 
The President has the right to go out and find that person, but the Senate has 
an obligation to determine whether, in fact, this is the best we can find out 
there in the whole country." So the Senate's ("we") preferences are at least of 
equal weight with those of the man who wins the presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
Adding them up, the reasons for rejecting Tower include: alleged drunkenness 
that no senator serving with Tower claims to have ever seen, but which most 
Democrats now say they believe on the basis of reports (cartridges?) gathered 
by the FBI. Undefined and undocumented "womanizing." The "appearance" of 
"conflicts of interest" (more about which in a moment). And the Senate's thirst 
for "the best." 
</P>
<P>
A rule: In Washington, when four reasons are given for doing something, the 
real reason is none of the four. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) was most worried about Tower's use of alcohol. Then Tower 
pledged not to touch it. Then Nunn changed his emphasis. Nunn was clear about 
only what he was not saying. "I'm not saying," he said, that Tower as a private 
consultant improperly gave information to defense contractors. But "it's the 
appearance that is so bad." 
</P>
<P>
Now, is it really asking too much to ask Nunn, who has rendered an emphatic 
judgment on Tower, to be comparably clear about his reasons for the judgment? 
It is simply smarmy for him to issue these simpering disclaimers ("I'm not 
saying . . . ") while destroying a man's reputation, career and life with 
studied ambiguities. 
</P>
<P>
Does Nunn think Tower today has an alcohol problem? Has Nunn decided that Tower 
behaved unethically as a consultant? If Nunn cannot decide, he should defer to 
the presidential decision on Tower. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a hopeless situation," Nunn says, because he cannot reveal his reasons 
for trashing Tower. FBI reports are confidential. They also are often 
confusing, contradictory and inconclusive. Because the White House has 
characterized the reports differently than Nunn has, Nunn has threatened to 
reopen the hearings and subpoena people for testimony under oath. That, he 
says, would be "unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
Oh? For whom? Not Tower, who can hardly be more injured. 
</P>
<P>
If it is fair to judge Tower for "appearances," it is as fair to note that Nunn 
"appears" to be taking this personally. As Nunn likes to say, I'm not saying 
that he is. But there is a "perception" that this is simply a power struggle. 
The perception may be unfair, but we know how seriously Nunn and his allies 
take perceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Some Democrats are behaving the way some Republicans did between 1949 and 1952, 
when they had been too long without the sobering responsibility of executive 
power. As Democrats bandy "allegations," try something. Try substituting the 
phrase "allegations of communist sympathies" for "allegations of alcohol abuse" 
(or "womanizing" or "conflicts of interest"). Then see what you think of the 
flavor of this senatorial high-mindedness. As some earlier senators (McCarthy 
and Jenner and others) understood, empty cartridges are the perfect ammunition 
for character assassinations.

DON'T SELL JORDAN DOWNS TO A DEVELOPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA MOORE and CHARLES F. ELSESSER JR., Claudia Moore chairs the Los 
Angeles Housing Authority Resident Advisory Council. Charles F. Elsesser Jr. is 
an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only in government do incompetents have the audacity to feel that they should 
be rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago the L.A. Housing Authority announced that it had so mismanaged 
and neglected the run-down 700-unit Jordan Downs Housing Project in 
South-Central Los Angeles that the only solution would be to turn it over to a 
"private developer." The agency said that only a "private developer" would be 
able to repair the project and maintain it at a minimal level of habitability. 
</P>
<P>
A close inspection of the few details that have been revealed shows that this 
is a bad deal for the public. The city would turn over to a private developer, 
at market value, the 40-acre parcel bordering the soon-to-be-completed Century 
Freeway. Of that 40 acres, 85% is undeveloped. If the Century Freeway and the 
expanded Watts Redevelopment Project are successful, the land could greatly 
increase in value. And the private owners would be free to do whatever they 
wished with the undeveloped land. 
</P>
<P>
As for the housing project, the new owners would have to commit to repairing 
the properties at an estimated cost of up to $14 million. But in return, the 
developer would receive a huge government subsidy. Seven hundred Section 8 
certificates would be supplied to the developer by the federal Department of 
Housing and Urban Development and the city Housing Authority. These 
certificates would provide a government-guaranteed income stream of well over 
$420,000 a month. It is also estimated that the developer could receive as much 
as $1.6 million a year in federal tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
So the developer could make millions off the deal. But what about the public? 
The public loses a vital low-income housing resource. In city hands, these 
units would remain in the pool of low-income housing forever. In private hands, 
they would be low income only so long as federal subsidies to the developer 
require it. Currently, this is estimated at from 5 to 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
The tenants, as always, are between a rock and a hard place. If they reject the 
plan, the Housing Authority remains their landlord. This is the same landlord 
who intentionally ignored their pleas of the last decade to repair Jordan 
Downs, allowing it to become the terrible place that it is. But if the tenants 
should accept the new private developer in return for some short-term repairs, 
they would be confronted with a landlord whose only goal is profit. As a 
result, many of the poorest and most needy would soon have no place to live. 
</P>
<P>
Goldrich &amp; Kest, a large developer prominently mentioned as the potential 
owner of the project, gave a hint to the tenants as to what to expect. "No 
way," said a spokesman, "would they allow tenants to remain if they had been 
delinquent in rent." Yet this is a project in which all of the families are 
poor. Making ends meet is a daily struggle. Working with tenants in financial 
difficulty is one of the challenges of public housing. But private landlords 
have no time for these daily dilemmas. Thus lost welfare checks or other 
financial crises will cause those families to be put out on the street, 
expanding the numbers of the homeless, adding to the government shelter cost. 
</P>
<P>
Will the Housing Authority protect its former tenants' interests? When asked, 
its director said that she did not intend to "tie the hands" of the private 
developer. Similarly, the City Council has shown little interest in the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there are alternatives. Money for repairs could be borrowed from 
Redevelopment Agency funds. Or the Housing Authority could set up a nonprofit 
corporation, or work with existing nonprofits, which could take advantage of 
the same subsidies as the private for-profit developer. Better yet, the Housing 
Authority could explore selling the units to the tenants themselves who, in 
partnership with nonprofit housing developers, could take advantage of the same 
subsidies to rehabilitate, repair and manage their property. 
</P>
<P>
All of these alternatives would preserve the units as low-income housing. 
However, these alternatives take time for study in a cooperative and respectful 
environment. None of them can be accomplished in the reactive, crisis-like 
atmosphere generated by the Housing Authority's inept handling of the present 
proposal. The tenants have asked Mayor Tom Bradley to grant them a year's delay 
to develop a proposal that will work. The tenants have also requested technical 
assistance to be serious participants in the process. Assemblywoman Maxine 
Waters (D-Los Angeles), whose district includes the project, has already 
requested a similar delay. 
</P>
<P>
By granting the tenants' request, the mayor could help change the atmosphere 
from one of confrontation to cooperation. By working with the tenants, he could 
create the possibility of innovative solutions. By questioning the present 
proposal, he would send a strong signal to the public that government 
incompetence should not be rewarded.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council on Tuesday approved construction of the $200-million 
Great American Plaza, which will include what would be the city's tallest 
building, a 480-foot office tower housing the bank's new headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The downtown complex, scheduled for completion in late 1991, will include a 
33-story office tower, a 15-story hotel and a canopied trolley station that 
will link the existing trolley system with the planned Bayside line. The 
trolley stop will be the system's first fully enclosed station. 
</P>
<P>
The project is planned for two blocks bounded by Kettner Boulevard, India 
Street, B Street and Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
It will include retail shops and a new space for the Museum of Photographic 
Arts. Plans call for a 300-seat theater, a photographic arts bookstore, 
administrative offices and about 5,000 square feet of exhibition space.

L.A. LANDFILL WON'T GET SLUDGE; 
</P>
<P>
PLAN OPPOSED BY LOPEZ CANYON NEIGHBORS DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Bowing to public pressure, Los Angeles sanitation officials Tuesday dropped 
plans to send sewage sludge to the Lopez Canyon Landfill in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
"Today marks a major victory, but we still have work to do," City Councilman 
Ernani Bernardi said, alluding to another city plan bitterly opposed by 
residents to enlarge the landfill for dumping garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation Director Delwin A. Biagi announced his decision in a letter to 
Bernardi, whose district includes the dump site. Biagi said the landfill is no 
longer needed for sludge disposal because of alternatives that have arisen, 
such as sending some of the sludge to Arizona for use as a fertilizer for 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result of some recent developments, we have decided to eliminate sludge 
disposal from consideration at Lopez Canyon," Biagi said in his letter. He said 
the concerns expressed by Bernardi and "your constituents in the area have 
caused us to take a new and careful look" at sludge disposal at the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Miller, assistant sanitation director, said in an interview that the 
sludge proposal also was dropped because it was delaying environmental studies 
on the more critical issue of expanding the landfill for disposal of household 
refuse. 
</P>
<P>
The action also eliminated a potentially troublesome issue for Bernardi and 
Mayor Tom Bradley, who are up for reelection April 11. 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation officials in December, 1987, proposed using the landfill for 
disposal of up to 1,200 tons of sludge a day. The city, forced by federal law 
to stop dumping sludge into Santa Monica Bay, has been trucking much of it to 
the BKK Landfill in West Covina. Some of it also is being sent to Ventura 
County for use as a landfill cover. 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation officials proposed sending it to Lopez Canyon, the only city-owned 
landfill, in case other sites became unavailable. Bernardi fought the plan, 
arguing that the landfill already receives most of the city's household trash. 
</P>
<P>
Sludge is removed from raw sewage during treatment at city plants. It is sent 
through processes that consume some of the organisms that make sewage a threat 
to health. It becomes the consistency of mud before being loaded onto trucks 
for disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation officials are proceeding with a proposal opposed by Bernardi and 
residents to extend the life of Lopez Canyon Landfill, due to close in 1992, 
until 2005 and possibly beyond for the disposal of household refuse. 
</P>
<P>
The landfill now receives about 4,000 of the 7,000 tons a day of household 
refuse collected by the city. Residents have opposed the expansion because of 
noise, odors and additional truck traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The city is preparing an environmental impact report on the proposal, which 
must be approved by the City Council and Bradley.

ANTONOVICH ASKS SUPPORTERS TO GIVE MONEY TO PICUS FOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich has written to 2,500 of his 
campaign donors, urging them to contribute to Jeanne Nemo's under-financed 
campaign to unseat City Councilwoman Joy Picus. 
</P>
<P>
The letter could help close the fund-raising lead that the San Fernando Valley 
councilwoman has over her five challengers in the April 11 Los Angeles city 
election. Nemo has raised $25,000 to Picus' $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich, a Republican, has access to contributors who might be willing to 
support Nemo, another Republican, against Picus, a Democrat, even though the 
council is a nonpartisan office. Television commentator Bruce Herschensohn, an 
unsuccessful GOP candidate for U.S. Senate in 1986, is preparing to write to 
supporters on Nemo's behalf, Nemo said. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, copied on Board of Supervisors' stationery but paid for by Nemo, 
Antonovich urges supporters to send Nemo "your maximum contribution." A 1985 
voter-approved city law limits contributions to council candidates to $500 per 
donor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Finding Solutions' 
</P>
<P>
"As your City Council representative," Antonovich wrote, "Jeanne will work to 
increase the Police Department and eliminate the drugs and gangs from our city. 
She is also committed to improving traffic flow, supporting planned growth that 
maintains the integrity of neighborhoods and finding solutions to problems we 
face with affordable housing, the homeless and our deteriorating 
infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
The text of the letter does not mention Picus by name but says, "The Los 
Angeles Police Department has been hampered by politicians who have 
deliberately kept the Police Department understaffed." 
</P>
<P>
"Today, we have a serious crime problem, yet Los Angeles is the most 
under-policed city in the nation," the text says. "Since the early 1970s, the 
population has increased from 2.8 million to 3.4 million, while the police have 
had their hands tied by not being allowed to increase with this growth." 
</P>
<P>
According to Antonovich, the Police Department had 7,145 officers in 1976. The 
Department now has 7,677 officers, a police spokesman said, but is expected to 
be up to 7,900 by July. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said Picus has been supportive of 
efforts to increase funding for additional police officers. Gates, however, 
does not endorse candidates in council races, the spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
Nemo said in an interview that she would consider establishing a rubbish 
collection tax on single-family homes to raise money for additional police. 
</P>
<P>
"We are about the only major city that subsidizes trash collection," Nemo said. 
"I think that it is time that we started charging for that if that is the only 
way we can raise money to hire sufficient number of police. 
</P>
<P>
"Fear of crime is the No. 1 issue," she said. "I think a significant increase 
in the number of police not only reduces street crime, but it makes people feel 
safer." 
</P>
<P>
Picus called Antonovich's letter "campaign rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
She said she supports a plan to increase the police force to 10,000 officers by 
1993. She did not say how she would pay for the additional officers, adding 
that she would need to "look at all the options" before considering a rubbish 
collection charge. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time a refuse collection fee was proposed, it was extremely unpopular 
in my district," Picus said. 
</P>
<P>
Nemo ran against Picus in 1985, finishing second in a field of five candidates 
with 21% of the vote. Picus won with 56% of the vote.

AL DIB ENDORSED; 
</P>
<P>
BERNSON BACKS BERNARDI'S OPPONENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson, breaking with City Hall protocol, 
Tuesday endorsed Al Dib over fellow Councilman Ernani Bernardi in the northeast 
San Fernando Valley's 7th District race. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson offered no criticism of Bernardi, his colleague for the past 10 years. 
He said he was supporting Dib, a 55-year-old past president of the Arleta 
Chamber of Commerce who recently sold his produce business to campaign 
full-time, because he has been a friend and a longtime political supporter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tireless Worker' 
</P>
<P>
"I know from personal experience that Al Dib will be a dedicated, energetic and 
experienced representative for the people of the northeast Valley," said 
Bernson, who also has given Dib the maximum $500 contribution permitted by law. 
"Over the years, Al has been a tireless worker on just about every important 
community service project in the area." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, who has never been opposed for reelection by a colleague, said: "Hal 
Bernson is over 18. There isn't anything I can say about it." 
</P>
<P>
It is rare, but not unheard of, for council members to endorse a challenger 
over an incumbent. Councilwoman Ruth Galanter is the only other council member 
this year to buck tradition. She is supporting slow-growth activist Laura Lake 
over Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky in the 5th District race. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson and Bernardi have generally agreed on issues, but relations between the 
two reached a low point in 1985 when Bernardi publicly attacked a Bernson 
proposal to clean up a crime-ridden, run-down area of Bernson's West Valley 
district. Bernardi, who sometimes bucks another council tradition of deferring 
to a colleague on a matter in his district, helped kill the plan. But Bernson 
said Tuesday that he harbored no ill feelings toward Bernardi. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said the endorsement "ought to be looked at as endorsement not against 
Ernie but for Dib." 
</P>
<P>
Dib, a Democrat-turned-Republican, ran unsuccessfully for the council's old 1st 
District seat in 1973 and 1977. He is among seven challengers to Bernardi in 
the April 11 election in a district that is largely new to the councilman 
because of the 1986 council redistricting.

AROUND THE VALLEY: THE LIGHTS AND THE REST OF THE HOUSE ARE RUN BY A TALKING 
COMPUTER NAMED ALEXANDER.

"This is Encino's version of affordable housing," Mayor Tom Bradley said, 
gazing at a talking mansion with more white columns than Scarlett O'Hara ever 
dreamt of, aflame with "Star Wars" lighting and stuffed with men in tuxedos and 
women in furs. 
</P>
<P>
His Honor's little joke was as close as the night came to understatement. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor and about 280 others attended a political fund-raiser/real-estate 
promotion/media event/art exhibit and society goosepile to unveil builder 
Dennis Michael Nouri's "House of the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
Americans traditionally jockey for a good view of the future, but futurology's 
record is spotty. In 1947 it was Sunday supplement wisdom that, in the 1980s, 
atomic power would reduce the workweek to four hours and there would be two 
helicopters in every garage. But who foretold massive drug abuse and the winter 
of the nuclear family? 
</P>
<P>
So it's open to question whether Nouri's house foreshadows the life style of 
2005. If it is to be the life style of the common man or even the 
run-of-the-millionaire, the economy has much work to do. 
</P>
<P>
The palatial, 7,500-square-foot house has four bedrooms with marble baths and 
fireplaces. In the dining room, a waterfall flows over crystal rocks and the 
embedded ends of severed optical fibers, creating underwater pinpoints of 
colored light, like drowning fireflies. 
</P>
<P>
Large abstract paintings by Iranian artist Massoud Arabshahi, featuring 
networks of strings, decorate it. The 20-by-18-foot "Return of the Comet" 
dominates the entryway, its vertical strings "showing that we strive to go up, 
up in our fantasies, but the day-to-day world pulls us down," explained one of 
Nouri's representatives. 
</P>
<P>
The interior is done in bleached-bone white oak. And the house is on White Oak 
Avenue. Does that mean. . . ? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," said Nouri with a grin. "Yes, it's no coincidence." 
</P>
<P>
The swimming pool too is embedded with optical fibers, duplicating the 
constellation Orion. Nouri even has optical fibers twined in the trees, 
creating a perpetual Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 10 miles in that one tree alone. Yes, I know it is 10 miles, 
exactly," he told a skeptical visitor, "because I just paid the bill." 
</P>
<P>
The lights and the rest of the house are run by a talking computer named 
Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander speaks in a sleepy male voice, like HAL from the film "2001" on 
Quaaludes. It replies to commands with "As you wish, master." A rebuke of "No, 
Alexander" draws a contrite "Sorry, master." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander can take phone calls, Nouri's assistants said, and can have a hot 
bath waiting when the master drives up. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you wish you had the listing?" an onlooker asked Mike Glickman, former 
boy wonder (now 28) of San Fernando Valley real estate. Glickman smiled a 
Cheshire-cat smile, because he does have the listing and expects "no trouble 
selling this for more than $3.7 million." 
</P>
<P>
This is the first of four houses he plans to build in the neighborhood, Nouri 
said, "and this one is going to be the smallest." The largest will have a 
man-made lake with a three-passenger submarine. And he'll throw in a free yacht 
with every purchase. (Not a back-yard yacht, the usual oceangoing type.) 
</P>
<P>
Mingled with the Iranian art fans and limousine looky-loos were 160 people who 
paid $500 per couple, as a fund-raiser for "The Committee for the Future of 
LA," a political action committee founded by Bradley to raise money for 
projects that "parallel" his political goals, a spokeswoman for Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Men wore black tie. Women wore flashy evening dresses, displaying more breasts 
than the poultry freezer at Gelson's. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Rene Piane, who wore a demure white silk robe and 3-foot wings with 
white feathers. Piane, a Santa Monica hairdresser, calls herself the Angel of 
Los Angeles. She attends public events, "sprinkling blessings of love," she 
said, hoping to become well-known "so the mayor or somebody will officially 
appoint me the angel of L.A." 
</P>
<P>
She was accompanied by her manager, Debbie Munford. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm her cousin," Munford said. "Who else would work 60 hours a week and then 
hang out with an angel at stuff like this? No one, that's who. Only cousins." 
</P>
<P>
A string quartet played Mozart's Third Divertimenti as Nouri showed Arabshahi's 
giant artwork to Bradley and demonstrated Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Mayor," Piane trilled from the staircase. "Remember me from the Mormon 
church?" 
</P>
<P>
Bradley looked up. It was not a question to ignore from an angel. 
</P>
<P>
"We met at the Mormons, remember? Will you name me the official angel of L.A.? 
C'mon, please." 
</P>
<P>
"Right, right," Bradley said, his face frozen in a smile, moving on. 
</P>
<P>
Later, actor Robert Wagner introduced Bradley to the crowd. Bradley praised 
Nouri's house. "I own it," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Nouri dropped her purse. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't worry," the mayor said. "I'm only kidding." 
</P>
<P>
"You're the mayor," Nouri said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes -- for life," replied Bradley, who appears a shoo-in for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the crowd missed the exchange, off-microphone, so Bradley repeated it: 
</P>
<P>
". . . And then I said, 'Yes, mayor -- for life!" 
</P>
<P>
The Bradleyites laughed enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said it was time for Alexander to put on the laser light show, in which 
a woman in a gold lame cape representing "the angel of the future" (sorry, 
Rene) danced by the pool and dived through a cloud of dry-ice fog into the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought you'd never ask," Alexander said, sleepily.

DROWNING VICTIM'S MOTHER TESTIFIES; 
</P>
<P>
WOMAN SAYS SUSPECT ACCUSED 2 OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A 21-year-old Arleta woman, charged in the killing of a childhood friend, tried 
to implicate others in the crime during the three years before she was 
arrested, the victim's mother testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Avila testified at a preliminary hearing in Glendale Municipal Court that 
Karen Severson tried to implicate two others in the drowning of Avila's 
17-year-old daughter, Michele, in a creek in the Angeles National Forest on 
Oct. 1, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Severson and Laura Doyle, 21, have been charged in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Avila, 47, said Severson moved in with her two weeks after her daughter's death 
to console her. During the six weeks that she stayed at the house, Severson 
aided Avila with her own investigation of Michele's death by suggesting names 
of individuals who might have been involved in the killing, Avila testified. 
</P>
<P>
But neither of the teen-age boys mentioned were implicated in the slaying by 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Severson and Doyle were arrested June 27 after sheriff's investigators received 
information from a witness, later identified as Eva Chirumbolo, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Chirumbolo, 21, also testified at the hearing Tuesday. She said she accompanied 
Doyle, Severson and Michele Avila to a creek in the Angeles National Forest on 
Oct. 1, 1985, but was not present when Avila was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Chirumbolo, who also testified at a preliminary hearing for Doyle in November, 
said she had been reluctant to come forward during the past three years because 
she feared for her life. Chirumbolo has not been charged in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Severson and Doyle could be sentenced to a maximum of 25 years to 
life in prison. Doyle is scheduled to be tried April 12 in Pasadena Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Severson is being held without bail, and Doyle is being held in lieu of $1 
million bail at Sybil Brand Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Severson's preliminary hearing is scheduled to continue today.

MARATHONER LEAVES HIS SOUTH AFRICAN HOME TO TRY TO FORGE A NEW BEGINNING IN 
AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

BOULDER, Colo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Republic of South Africa, where sport often appears to lack a human 
face, this strange society is at once a birthplace of achingly talented 
athletes and the burial ground for their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
There is a road there and it is a true path for only those whose skin color 
gains them entrance. For the remaining -- for the many -- there is only a 
chance to run alongside the path, never on it. 
</P>
<P>
Unless they choose to run away. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Plaatjes brought the woman who now is his wife and their child to America 
last year to find if there was another path. What he has found is that everyone 
is allowed access to the path here, but there is a cost. In this year away from 
his country, the rest of his family and much of his heart, Mark Plaatjes, 
another hopeful citizen-to-be, believes he has paid the price. 
</P>
<P>
Plaatjes, 27, formerly of Johannesburg, is now stateless. When he runs Sunday, 
as one of the favorites in the Los Angeles Marathon, his new life will have 
come full circle from the time a year ago that he stepped off a plane with two 
suitcases, money enough for three weeks and dreams enough to fill this new 
land. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine that you have a back yard in which to play and it is large and 
beautiful. Imagine also, though, that never, ever are you allowed to leave your 
yard to play with anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
At some point it was not enough for Plaatjes, South Africa's best marathoner, 
to be only that. He longed to run outside of South Africa and that was not 
possible for him. 
</P>
<P>
So he tried something. He went with some other track athletes to Swaziland to 
establish residency and become citizens. Then, after some time, they could run 
anywhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
That did not work out. Plaatjes went home to his country, the outcast of the 
world community. Not since 1960 has South Africa been welcome in the Olympics. 
Since 1976, that ban has extended to virtually every other international 
sporting event. Nor will most of the world come to South Africa to play, 
because of the country's policy of racial separation or apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
If you are a South African athlete and you are possessed of rare ability, this 
is an unhappy circumstance. If you are a nonwhite athlete, living in a nation 
that has an official policy that declares you are somehow less a citizen than 
whites, this is what drives you to boldness. 
</P>
<P>
"Being competitive is an innate response of any human being," said Plaatjes 
said, whose family is temporarily settled in Boulder while he prepares for 
Sunday's L.A. Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"Being an athlete in South Africa is very frustrating. You compete against the 
same people all the time. You compare times with a person (not in South Africa) 
but it is not the same as when you run against that person. You can't call 
yourself the best or know how good you are when you can't compete against the 
rest of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Plaatjes had a special problem in this sporting equation. Because he was 
successful, he was accepted to an unusual degree by white South Africans, who 
classify people as white, black or colored, those who are neither. But there 
were some who did not like this man winning so much. Because he was colored -- 
half black and half white -- he was beloved by the nonwhites in South Africa. 
But there were some who did not like this man winning so much white money. 
</P>
<P>
He was living on both sides and there were people on each side who objected. 
Plaatjes was doing well and he was winning, but when he left the country there 
was still talk that he left to make quick money overseas. They thought he would 
return. 
</P>
<P>
This makes Plaatjes angry. Why, if he wanted to get rich, would he have left 
South Africa? He had a big shoe-company contract. He owned a five-bedroom house 
in the colored suburb of Fleurhof. He supported an extended family, paid his 
medical school tuition and bought a car, all on the money he made from running. 
</P>
<P>
Money wasn't his motivation for leaving his yard. 
</P>
<P>
"It was simple things, like being able to look in a real estate book and be 
able to choose a house from all the houses in the book and say, 'What a nice 
house.' And not worry, if we are allowed to live in this neighborhood," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't even exist for black people in South Africa. You are told where 
to live. You can't choose. I think it was the determining factor -- I felt my 
family needed to have choices for determining its own future." 
</P>
<P>
If he left, Plaatjes would certainly sacrifice his family's financial future. 
But life was growing so unbearable in South Africa that the prospect of leaving 
behind family, friends and security didn't seem a difficult choice. 
</P>
<P>
"People started giving me honorary white status because I was the sole non-pure 
black winning major national events," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This treatment really bothered me. To give you an example, in 1986, when they 
had independence celebrations, they asked me to carry the flag and give a 
speech. That bothered me. I could never do that. But as soon as the word 
filtered out that they had made this offer, my family started getting phone 
calls, threatening that they would find me dead in the street when I went for 
my run. They threatened my mom that they would burn down the house and kill 
me." 
</P>
<P>
"They" never identified themselves, Plaatjes said, but black groups exist in 
South Africa to punish those seen as collaborators with the white government. 
To some, Plaatjes, who had white friends as well as nonwhite, who was well off, 
who was more quiet and scholarly than radical, was in league with the 
government. Another aspect of apartheid's damage has been to make combatants 
out of the victims of the policy. 
</P>
<P>
Plaatjes was being watched. After he had run a marathon in 2 hours 8 minutes 58 
seconds, it was worse. He was even more popular and had even more endorsements. 
There was even more pressure to speak out. He was criticized for even 
competing, because the competition, although integrated, was organized by the 
South African Amateur Athletic Union. 
</P>
<P>
"What these people don't understand is that for a lot of guys, especially the 
black athlete in South Africa, it's a way out of the situation they are in. If 
you want to compete, there is no alternative. These groups don't provide an 
alternative. If they were to put up races, have meetings, start clubs and 
things like that, then you've got an alternative. But now if you don't compete 
for the SAAAU, you don't compete. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want people to make their own decisions. They draw a line and if 
you take one step off that line, they condemn you." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes they try to kill you. 
</P>
<P>
Plaatjes and a friend were running in a grassy meadow between Fleurhof and 
Soweto. They were returning to Plaatjes' home when they began to hear chanting. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened to be Labor Day and on Labor Day you had to stay home from work," 
he said. "We heard this noise and we looked across this little stream and there 
were maybe 10,000 people standing there chanting. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to my friend, 'I wonder what they are chanting at. They're probably 
watching a soccer game.' 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'It doesn't look like that to me.' 
</P>
<P>
"They were all facing our direction. We took a corner and it was like maybe 
2,000-3,000 of them coming straight at us. They were throwing bricks. Have you 
ever heard of necklacing? (To be necklaced is to have a tire hung around your 
neck and then set afire.) They had tires and they had gasoline. They obviously 
had something planned for us." 
</P>
<P>
They escaped that time, but it was during that period, June to December 1987, 
that three of the top black athletes in South Africa died under mysterious 
circumstances. One, who had been a soldier, supposedly shot himself in the leg 
while running. Another was stabbed to death by his politically-radical brother. 
A third was run down by a truck on a sidewalk while he was jogging. 
</P>
<P>
Plaatjes says he had a similar close call. He was running with Bruce Fordyce, 
who is white, and some other runners on the sidewalk of a broad, four-lane road 
in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy was driving a van with tinted windows," Plaatjes said. "We were 
running on the sidewalk and he was riding in the outside lane. The next minute 
he was right behind us on the sidewalk, coming straight at us. If Bruce hadn't 
turned around and looked, the guy would have wiped us out." 
</P>
<P>
Plaatjes was getting close to the emotional end of his rope. He believed that 
he was doing good in his own way, talking with black athletes and encouraging 
them to seek endorsements and a better education. But it was clear that he 
would have to cave in to the racial separation that some powerful people on 
both sides advocated. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the type of person who believes that if you want to solve the next 
person's problem, there has to be a line of communication," he said. "I have to 
be able to come to you and say, 'Look, what is wrong?' Then you and I can agree 
or not agree. But if you turn your back on me and I turn my back to you, how 
are we going to ever solve anything? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that by never talking to whites and never associating with them 
and never competing with them is ever going to solve anything. I have to 
compete against the best, whether they are black, white, or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Plaatjes and Shirley, who would soon be married, and their 4-year-old 
daughter Gene arrived in the United States for a three-week vacation in 
January, 1988. Mark intended to have a job interview in Chicago and perhaps try 
to get into a race. 
</P>
<P>
This country was not new to Plaatjes. He had already spent two years at the 
University of Georgia on athletic scholarship. He flourished as a pre-med 
student, but had to return to South Africa because of his father's illness. Now 
he was back, for a short visit. 
</P>
<P>
Plaatjes found out that if he wanted to compete he would have to renounce his 
citizenship. Glenn Latimer, his adviser, arranged a meeting in Chicago with an 
administrator of The Athletics Congress, the national governing body for track. 
They contacted an immigration attorney in Philadelphia. Suddenly they were 
setting something very serious in motion. Something they had never considered. 
</P>
<P>
"Shirley and I started speaking about it," Plaatjes said. "We were so isolated. 
(They were living in Lake Villa, Ill. with Latimer and his wife.) At night, 
when everyone was asleep, Shirley would wake me up and we would talk." 
</P>
<P>
Shirley mostly remembers crying in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd cry, thinking about the family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But they did decide. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it was good for a number of reasons," Plaatjes said. "We both are 
young, we have our whole futures ahead of us. Gene would be able to grow up in 
a society other than South Africa. We wanted to give her the choices we didn't 
have. 
</P>
<P>
"Running really wasn't part of my decision. After I made the decision (to give 
up the passports) and if TAC would have said no, we still would have stayed." 
</P>
<P>
They sent their passports to their attorney, who sent them to the South African 
embassy in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I lost something, like something was missing," Shirley said. 
</P>
<P>
They knew that if their asylum was denied, they would become stateless persons, 
citizens of no country. The attorney had advised them to expect the interim 
period to be difficult. The uncertainty lingered in the weeks before the 1988 
Los Angeles Marathon. What if they were not welcomed by the U.S. State 
Department? 
</P>
<P>
Each turned to the other and burst out laughing at the memory. It was both a 
nervous and relieved laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"We're laughing because it was just . . . " Plaatjes said. "People will never 
understand how horrendous that period before L.A. was. I don't know how I ran 
at L.A., really." 
</P>
<P>
They were granted asylum, based on Plaatjes' occupation, physical therapist, 
was on a priority list. Political asylum would have been granted, based on the 
death threats Plaatjes faced in South Africa, but that waiting list was two 
years long. 
</P>
<P>
Plaatjes came to run in last year's Los Angeles Marathon. He was a stateless 
person and, therefore not a South African, so he was issued a TAC card. It was 
the first time Plaatjes had ever run outside South Africa. It was an 
overwhelmingly emotional time and the running was only part of it. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt extremely frightened," Plaatjes said. "Shirley was frightened and 
nervous. We were thinking of our own futures and our families in South Africa. 
What would happen to them now? Would we ever see them again?" 
</P>
<P>
Plaatjes finished third in 2:10:41 and was happy. He had finally run free. 
</P>
<P>
The Plaatjes family was moving again. In the 13 months they have been in this 
country, they have been shuttling between Boulder and various Chicago-area 
suburbs. Now there was 5-month-old Luz, their second daughter. The money was 
tight, and this last summer was the worst. 
</P>
<P>
"We had absolutely no idea how much this was going to cost," Plaatjes said of 
the ever-escalating legal fees for citizenship. "Shirley was pregnant. We had 
to pay $1,000 a month for the attorney and try to put away some money for the 
baby. Everything I would make would go to doctors, attorneys, Gene was growing, 
she had to have clothes." 
</P>
<P>
The family had been living with various people, camping out on floors and 
trying not to be in the way. It was not wearing well. Finally, this winter, 
they settled in Lake Villa for four months, the family record for living in one 
U.S. city. Mark was working in Lake Forest as a physical therapist at a school 
for handicapped children. Life was hectic. 
</P>
<P>
"Our life style this last year has had an effect on all of us, especially 
Gene," Plaatjes said. "Every time we go to a new place she would start making 
friends. In Waukegan, she was going to school and she got to know all the kids 
in the neighborhood. She could visit and establish her own social pattern with 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
"With the moving, every time we pack bags, Gene says, 'Where are we moving 
now?' The minute she gets to know somebody we leave. She's not really attached 
to anything. I think she needs that. You can see in her behavior, she behaves 
like a big person, not a child. I think that's due to the fact that she's 
always in the company of adults and she's always hearing adult conversations." 
</P>
<P>
For Shirley, who had never been to the U.S., it was the isolation. She was at 
home without transportation and no one to talk to. Also, she was used to 
working but now stayed home all day. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't have friends or people to talk to," she said. "We were staying 
so far from everything, we couldn't go out, really. There was no privacy. We 
have been living with people (so long) I got to a stage where I couldn't bear 
it. When you have a child, you must have a home. You must have privacy and be 
free to do what you want." 
</P>
<P>
And with all of that, Plaatjes was injured and not running well. He was 
depressed and not sure what was wrong with him. Finally, he went through a 
series of tests and it was discovered that his iron stores were almost totally 
depleted and that he had an allergy that made him feel sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he entered the Columbus Marathon in November. 
</P>
<P>
"The race was very important to me for a number of reasons," he said. "I had to 
prove to myself, first of all, that I could still do it. After seven months of 
running like a dog, I started getting worried." 
</P>
<P>
He felt great before the race, but the conditions on the day of the race did 
were not conducive to great times. The last half of the race was run into a 
28-m.p.h. head wind. On no part of the course was the wind less than 15 m.p.h. 
Plaatjes, and the rest of the elite field, backed off the pace. He won, in 
2:12, and was satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
For Plaatjes, it was a kind of vindication. He had been snubbed by race 
directors and shoe companies. Many of them wondered if he was going to go back 
to South Africa. Some were just doing business in a manner to which Plaatjes 
was unaccustomed. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the big problems I had in this first year," he said. "I learned 
that when you talk to people over here and they say they are going to do 
something or they intend to do something, it doesn't necessarily mean they are 
going to do it or that they intend to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I come from a society at home where if I sit down with somebody and we are 
discussing a contract and they say, 'We'd like to have a two-year contract and 
this is how we would like to structure it,' and then I would say, 'I'm happy 
with that.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then we go away from that meeting and we assume that that is what both parties 
agreed upon. Over here, they agree to things and they don't really mean it. You 
phone the next day and they have forgot completely about it." 
</P>
<P>
Plaatjes figures he needs the contracts if he is to finance medical school. 
When he quit Georgia and returned to South Africa, school was put on hold. His 
father died and Plaatjes stepped forward to care for his family of nine 
brothers and sisters, as well as Shirley and Gene. 
</P>
<P>
He eventually did return to school, and was accepted as one of four nonwhites 
admitted to the medical school at the University of Witwatersrand in 
Johannesburg. He went through three years and, discouraged with the power South 
African pharmaceutical companies held over the school, Plaatjes changed to 
physical therapy. But he never gave up his dream of being a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I was 12, I wanted to be a doctor," he said. "Just being in our 
community where one hospital served one-half million people. You see what kind 
of care they get. My father was treated so badly there, at the nonwhite 
hospital. That contributed to his death. My brother died from neglect at the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was young, I did volunteer work there. The main reason I wanted to 
become a doctor at home was because I wanted to help the people there." 
</P>
<P>
Plaatjes has applied to several schools, including Johns Hopkins, Georgetown, 
Howard and Duke. He expects to hear about school acceptance in the next two 
weeks. It will mean at least one more move for the family, but it is important, 
for the future. Running may take a secondary role for Plaatjes. 
</P>
<P>
Primary for the family is U.S. citizenship. On April 22, they will become 
permanent residents and the clock starts running on the citizenship. Plaatjes, 
if he continues competing at this level, will become the top American 
marathoner. Last year he ran two minutes faster than any other American. Also 
in April he will be able to represent the U.S. in international competition. 
</P>
<P>
With citizenship a real dream now, Plaatjes is able to talk about his political 
beliefs. During the last year, he was advised not to speak out in case it 
affected his asylum case. Now, when he does speak out, it's with an awareness 
that some people in South Africa are angered at his stance against sporting and 
economic boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
"If you speak to the everyday black in South Africa, you will find that they 
disagree with boycotts because they are the first people it will affect," he 
said. "Then you get the radicals, or the people who have been driven to become 
radicals by the government, and they will always be for the boycotts because 
they say they are already treated like dirt, and if they lose a job because of 
a boycott, they can't get any poorer. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the view the radicals take. I don't agree with that. Boycotts have 
their place. I believe that companies that do business in South Africa and 
don't pay equally for equal qualifications, and treat blacks poorly, they are 
there because they can make a huge profit by paying less for labor -- they 
should be boycotted. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in total disinvestment from all companies that are doing 
business in South Africa. You are just making it worse. A lot of companies are 
selling out, and who is buying? It's definitely not blacks that are buying." 
</P>
<P>
If that makes Plaatjes unpopular in South Africa, look at the irony. He has 
renounced citizenship in a country that denied him the rights of white 
citizens. He's attacked by both blacks and whites. He's struggling to support a 
family in a new land where he's not a citizen, either. What else is there? 
</P>
<P>
He has escaped from the big, beautiful yard. A lovely prison. Now Plaatjes is 
free to run on his own path.

ERA ENDS: RAIDERS, ORNSTEIN COME TO PARTING OF THE WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another Raider legend passed from the scene, but this one wasn't a raging 
defensive end or a wacky outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
It was promotions director Mike Ornstein, the blunt-spoken, contentious, living 
embodiment of the Raider ideal in an administrator's body, whose 13-year career 
came to an abrupt halt Tuesday. The club announced it as a resignation, but 
Raider sources said that Al Davis fired Ornstein after a meeting Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't fired," Ornstein said. "I think Al will tell you that. We mutually 
parted, is the way he said it." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to their other oft-chronicled problems, the Raiders have been in 
the throes of a front-office exodus, as the attendant gloom around them takes a 
toll. Already gone since the start of last season from the skeleton crew that 
Davis prefers were long-time traveling secretary Ken LaRue; publications 
director Steve Hartman and community affairs director Gil Lafferty-Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Ornstein had talked recently of leaving, and Davis is said to have become aware 
of it. In addition, Davis was said to have held him accountable for leaks to 
the press during the Super Bowl, when Ornstein was the lone Raider official in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Thus ends one of the more interesting "promotions" careers. A New York City 
native, as is Davis, Ornstein started as John Madden's secretary in 1976 and 
moved up from there. 
</P>
<P>
He won undying fame before the 1984 Raider Super Bowl victory in Tampa by 
ordering Irv Cross of CBS off the sideline -- while Cross was on the air. CBS 
was the network of the hated National Conference and Ornstein was not one to 
tiptoe around Davis' foes. 
</P>
<P>
Nor anyone else. In 1986, Ornstein punched his fellow senior administrator, 
John Herrera, at the Raider training camp in an argument over who had used a 
movie projector last. Herrera later swore out a complaint, and the dispute had 
to be settled in court. Ornstein held his breath but Davis shrugged the whole 
thing off. 
</P>
<P>
Ornstein was then acting as the team's publicist, too, but gave the job up when 
a couple of losing seasons threatened to finish off his already tenuous 
relationship with the press corps. 
</P>
<P>
After the team's 1984 wipeout loss at Chicago, he grew angry at what he 
perceived as a lack of decorum by writers in the press box and was overheard -- 
and subsequently quoted -- as saying he hoped their plane flight home crashed. 
</P>
<P>
However, when not in one of his killer funks, Ornstein, known as Orny, could 
also be personable and gregarious. He was one of Davis' most devoted courtiers, 
and sometimes attended religious services with him. Davis was said to prize 
Ornstein because he was tough and he got things done. 
</P>
<P>
Ornstein haunted the sidelines at practices, in the style of Davis, applauding 
the players enthusiastically as they ran their drills. During games he often 
sat in the press box near Davis and loudly cheered and moaned his way through 
games, play by play, with the rest of the Raider inner circle. During 
off-seasons, he coached the Raider basketball team -- and excoriated the Rams' 
basketball team for any writer who needed an incendiary quote. 
</P>
<P>
As much as any of the Raider insiders, Ornstein lived for the team, and when it 
fell on hard times, his funks grew longer. He started looking around and made 
little secret of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in this place, off and one, for 13 years," Ornstein said from his 
Raider office late Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this place. I love the people. We have a lot of ups and downs. We have 
our ups and downs, but basically it's a good job. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's time to make a move, if I ever want to get ahead in administration, 
become a general manager some day in the league. Because there's only one boss 
here. I just felt like it was a good time." 
</P>
<P>
Davis was out of town and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders live on, but it isn't ever going to be the same.

ORNSTEIN ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Ornstein, a member of the Raiders' front office since the team moved south 
from Oakland in 1982, said Tuesday he has resigned his position with the team. 
</P>
<P>
Ornstein, 35, was a senior administrator with the Raiders, primarily involved 
in public relations, marketing and promotions. 
</P>
<P>
He had previously served as an administrative assistant to Raider Coach John 
Madden in 1976-77 and spent five years in private business before returning to 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just been here a long time," Ornstein said. "It's time to move on to 
something else. I've loved my association with the Raiders. It's been 
absolutely fantastic. I've been involved with what I believe is the finest 
organization in sports. 
</P>
<P>
"But as far as moving ahead in my career and reaching my ambition of someday 
becoming a general manager, I felt it was time to move on and explore other 
opportunities, hopefully in sports." 
</P>
<P>
Ornstein became a celebrity of sorts when he pushed commentator Irv Cross and 
told him to move off the Raider sidelines while Cross was on live television 
before the Super Bowl at Tampa, Fla., Jan. 22, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders beat the Washington Redskins, 38-9, in that game.

DODGERS STILL LEAD ARMS RACE; 
</P>
<P>
FERNANDO BIG QUESTION MARK, SAYS DEMPSEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON EDES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
VERO BEACH, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For this sermon on the mound, we bring you the Irreverend Rick Dempsey, the 
Dodger catcher whose shin guards may be older than the Dead Sea Scrolls but 
whose perspective goes far beyond the bars that cross his mask. 
</P>
<P>
On this occasion, fewer than five weeks before the start of the regular season, 
Dempsey offered a meditation that, if titled, would go something like this: 
"Faith, Hope, Orel and Fernando, but the Greatest of These is Orel." 
</P>
<P>
And while Dempsey was extolling the revival of Fernando Valenzuela, the virtues 
of (Tim) Crews control in the bullpen, the blessing of a Ramon Martinez in the 
rotation and the sublimity of an Orel Hershiser, he yielded the floor to 
testimonials from Crews, Tim Belcher and Ricky Horton, the left-hander who fell 
from grace. 
</P>
<P>
"The mastery is still there," Dempsey said of a pitching staff that led the 
National League last season in complete games with 32, shutouts with 24, and 
saves with 49, not to mention Cy Young Award winner Hershiser, a rookie of the 
year in Belcher and a comeback pitcher of the year in Tim Leary. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is pretty healthy and our main guys are fairly strong." 
</P>
<P>
One main guy who isn't, of course, is Valenzuela, whose left shoulder gave out 
last season after 255 starts without a miss, nearly 2,000 innings and more 
screwballs than he would care to count. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, Valenzuela -- who won only five games in 1988 -- took his next 
tentative step toward total recovery by throwing 15 minutes of batting 
practice, after which all parties involved expressed satisfaction with his 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
To expect anything different in spring training, of course, is tantamount to 
heresy. 
</P>
<P>
"Fernando is a question mark," Dempsey said. "But I've got to think a guy with 
his experience, if he walks out to the mound, he'll win his share of games. I 
look for him to win 15-plus. 
</P>
<P>
"It may take him half a season to get rolling -- he may be just around the .500 
mark or a little better the first half -- but then he should take off and be 
his usual self, when he gets his strength back and his confidence." 
</P>
<P>
If Dempsey projects 15-plus wins for the so-called question mark of the staff, 
imagine what he has to say about the rest of the starters, starting with 
right-hander Martinez, who will turn 21 March 22 and will be the fifth starter 
while John Tudor tries to come back from major elbow surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, a native of the Dominican Republic, was 1-3 in nine appearances -- 
six of them starts -- with the Dodgers last season, then added an improved 
curveball to an already above-average fastball and changeup while going 7-1 in 
the winter leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Ramon is mature enough to stay in the big leagues," Dempsey said. "He handled 
the pressure real well last season and showed tremendous poise." 
</P>
<P>
Although Leary, a 17-game winner last season, was dropped from the postseason 
rotation after a September in which he was 2-3 with a 5.13 ERA, Dempsey 
disputes the idea that there was any drop-off by the right-hander who had 
career highs in starts with 34, ERA at 2.91, complete games with nine, shutouts 
with six, innings pitched at 228 2/3, and strikeouts at 180. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see any decline physically," Dempsey said. "I think when he was at 17 
wins, he may have tried to win three games in one night and found out he 
couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was more mentally tired than physically tired. All those innings 
took a toll mentally -- I think he started to doubt himself a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think he finally relaxed and learned he can win 20 games. There were 
things that upset him near the end of the season, that got him out of his 
rhythm, but I think he's learned to combat those things now." 
</P>
<P>
Of Belcher, the right-hander who won 12 games and designation as the league's 
top rookie, Dempsey said: "He had a progressive season, all the way around. He 
started out as a reliever, worked his way into the rotation and had problems at 
first. He didn't know what pitches to throw late in the game, how to close a 
team out. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew he needed to pick up an off-speed pitch, which he did, his forkball. 
He started making better decisions on the mound, he went from a five-inning 
pitcher to a nine-inning pitcher and he's the kind of guy, when he gets 
something, he's not going to give it up very easily. 
</P>
<P>
"By the end of the season, he was one of the best pitchers in the league. He's 
got all the guts in the world, isn't intimidated by anybody, and I look for him 
to win at least 15 games." 
</P>
<P>
Belcher might have had that many wins last season with a couple of breaks -- 
such as not pitching the night Tom Browning of the Reds beat the Dodgers with a 
perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the best game I pitched all year," said Belcher, who spent the 
off-season in Ohio doing color radio commentary for Kenyon College basketball 
games. "That was the most dominating eight innings I threw all season." 
</P>
<P>
Even Dempsey, though, has begun to run out of things to say about Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
"He's capable of doing anything," the catcher said. "There's no way I can put a 
cap on what he's capable of doing. He's the best pitcher I've ever caught, and 
if anyone is going to win 30 games while I'm still around, he's the guy." 
</P>
<P>
If the Dodgers are strong in starters and in finishers -- Jay Howell and 
Alejandro Pena are as imposing a tandem of closers as there is in the league -- 
they are vulnerable in middle relief. Brian Holton, superb in that role last 
season, went to Baltimore in the Eddie Murray deal, leaving Crews to assume his 
role. And Crews -- despite a 4-0 record and 3.14 ERA in 42 appearances last 
season -- was left off the postseason roster when Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda 
decided he preferred a left-hander, Horton, who wound up being ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget that," Crews said of his enforced inactivity last fall. "I'm 
not going to hold any grudges but I should have been there. They said so 
themselves, that they never would have gotten there without me. 
</P>
<P>
"I got kicked off for a lefty that was disappointing for them. When I reach 40 
years old and look back, I'm going to look back with disappointment and believe 
I should have been there." 
</P>
<P>
If the situation was tough for Crews, empathize for a moment with his family. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a bad thing," Crews said. "I didn't air anybody out here (on the team), 
but for two weeks I put my wife and kids through hell before I finally got rid 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, Crews -- like Belcher -- is unsigned and not thrilled with the 
Dodgers' offer. But he recognizes that they need him. 
</P>
<P>
Horton was more needy than needed last season, which he began as the No. 1 
starter for the Chicago White Sox and finished as an undependable member of the 
Dodger bullpen. Horton was 6-10 with a 4.86 ERA with the White Sox, 1-1 with a 
5.00 ERA in 12 relief appearances with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Last winter, he was offered to the Mets in a deal for Wally Backman that fell 
through. One Dodger official said he would have gladly hauled Horton in a 
wheelbarrow to New York to make the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a question mark," Dempsey said. "But you can't say he won't do the job 
until he proves he can't do the job." 
</P>
<P>
Horton, who pitched four seasons with St. Louis before being traded to Chicago, 
said he never felt comfortable in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"As a (White Sox pitcher) for two months, I was pretty bad just about every 
time out," Horton said. "Without any excuses, I was just a bad pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Things improved, he said, after he went home to St. Louis for the All-Star 
break. "The All-Star break just didn't come early enough for me," he said. 
"This year, I'm lobbying to have it in May." 
</P>
<P>
With the Dodgers, Horton isn't politicking for anything but a chance to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel the jury is always out," he said. "I don't think there's ever a time 
when they say, 'OK, the verdict is in, you're a major league pitcher.' There 
are a few exceptions, but never for a sinker-slider left-handed reliever." 
</P>
<P>
The 10th spot on the Dodger staff is open. Given his druthers, Dempsey would 
like to see another left-hander, which offers some hope to Ray Searage, who has 
had brief trials with the Mets, Brewers and White Sox before spending last 
summer with Albuquerque. Searage, who will be 34 in May, is living in 
last-chance territory. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Munoz, a highly regarded left-hander who was 7-2 with a 1.00 ERA at 
double-A San Antonio last season, probably will be kept back another season. 
</P>
<P>
With a surplus of outfielders primed for big league exposure -- Mike Devereaux, 
Chris Gwynn, Jose Gonzalez -- the Dodgers undoubtedly will be shopping for help 
this spring, too. But for now, they are holding their own in the arms race. 
</P>
<P>
And on that, Lasorda and Dempsey are of one mind: Amen.

Mike Tyson's return to the ring against Frank Bruno didn't translate into a 
box-office success Saturday night, and a Las Vegas Hilton executive said the 
resort will think twice before hosting another Tyson bout until a credible 
opponent emerges. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the boxing business say they too will pass on future heavyweight 
title mismatches unless site fees are lowered dramatically from the $7 million 
the Hilton paid for the bout. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton officials said they lost several million dollars on the live gate 
because many fans and gamblers weren't willing to pay the average ticket price 
of $700 for a fight they perceived as a mismatch.

The Cincinnati Bengals have decided they have no interest in bringing back 
Stanley Wilson, even if the National Football League does reinstate him from a 
suspension for cocaine use, Bengal General Manager Paul Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, 27, a former University of Oklahoma player from Wilmington was 
suspended for drug use on the eve of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals had accepted Wilson back after yearlong drug suspensions in 1985 
and 1987.

Eddie (the Eagle) Edwards has been barred from competing in World Cup ski 
jumping events at least through the end of the current season. 
</P>
<P>
The British Ski Federation said it had decided to keep the British plasterer on 
lower-level events for the time being. Edwards is expected to return to action 
soon after recovering from a shoulder injury suffered in training last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards became a celebrity a year ago as he finished last in both the 70- and 
90-meter jumps at the Winter Olympics in Calgary.

NEWSWIRE: FORMER SPUR STAR GERVIN HOSPITALIZED AFTER APPARENT DRUG OVERDOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former San Antonio Spurs star George (Iceman) Gervin was admitted to a hospital 
as the victim of an apparent drug overdose, according to a San Antonio 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
A Methodist Hospital spokeswoman confirmed that Gervin, 38, was taken to the 
hospital by ambulance Saturday, but she could not elaborate on his treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The San Antonio Light said that according to a police report, Gervin told an 
officer that he snorted what he "thought was cocaine" and later did not know 
what it was that he put up his nose. Gervin also told the officer he "did not 
want to commit suicide," the police report stated. 
</P>
<P>
Spur Coach Larry Brown said he had tried to get Gervin out of retirement a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell me you have got to hit rock bottom before they can make you better. 
Maybe this is what it's going to take for Ice to get straight," Brown said.

RED SCHOENDIENST, AL BARLICK ELECTED TO HALL OF FAME BY VETERANS COMMITTEE

Red Schoendienst, a sure-handed second baseman who led the National League in 
fielding seven times, and former umpire Al Barlick were elected to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame Tuesday by the veterans committee, but Phil Rizzuto was snubbed 
once again. 
</P>
<P>
Schoendienst, 66, spent 18 years in the major leagues -- 14 with the St. Louis 
Cardinals -- and batted over .300 seven times. He also managed the Cardinals 
from 1965-76, winning pennants in 1967 and '68 and a World Series title in '67. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife thought I should be in a long time ago, but that's wives," 
Schoendienst said from his apartment in St. Petersburg, Fla., where the 
Cardinals are in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
Barlick, 73, known for his booming voice on balls-and-strikes calls, was one of 
the youngest umpire to make it to the majors when, at 25, he was called up to 
the National League in 1940. Barlick spent 27 full seasons in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a miracle that I got in," Barlick said by telephone from his home 
in Gilbert, Ariz., where he is working as an umpire consultant for the National 
League. "Other than that, I really don't have anything to say." 
</P>
<P>
Rizzuto was the American League's most valuable player in 1950 for the New York 
Yankees.

TWO FLEW THE COOP, TWO DIED EN ROUTE, BUT 269 WILD TURKEYS ARRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Listen closely and you may hear a gobble in the San Bernardino National Forest. 
It means that wild turkey hunting, heretofore a waste of time in Southern 
California, can't be far behind. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Fish and Game, with funding and assistance from the Cherry 
Valley Archers of San Bernardino and the Arrowhead Fish and Game Club, has 
transplanted 89 of the Merriam's species from the Black Hills of South Dakota 
to four sites near Big Bear Lake and to the Tejon Ranch in the Tehachapis. 
Another 180 went to sites in central and Northern California, where virtually 
all of the state's 100,000 Rio Grande turkeys reside. 
</P>
<P>
According to Chuck Wagner of the Cherry Valley Archers, these are the first 
wild turkeys planted in Southern California since 1938, when some pen-raised 
birds were tried but couldn't cope with predators. 
</P>
<P>
These also are the first pure Merriam's in the state. Whereas the Rio Grandes 
in central and Northern California -- themselves imports from Texas at one time 
-- prefer low-elevation oak and brush habitat, the Merriam's birds favor higher 
elevations and conifer forests. 
</P>
<P>
The state's spring wild turkey season opens March 25, running until April 30. 
But DFG biologist John Massie, who supervised the project, hopes the hunters 
can restrain themselves for a year or two to allow the flocks to build up. 
</P>
<P>
"They can go out and shoot them now but they'd only be hurting themselves," 
Massie said. "With some forbearance, they could have some real good hunting in 
later years." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner said, "We're hoping it will be two years. Our people are going to lay 
off, and we hope other hunters will, too. It would be fine if people just want 
to come out and look at 'em or photograph 'em. I'm just hoping we can keep the 
poachers out." 
</P>
<P>
Al Stegall, the DFG warden responsible for the area, said taking turkeys out of 
season is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or a sentence of 
up to six months in the county jail. 
</P>
<P>
"It being an experimental program, if one of my wardens caught somebody, we 
would probably petition the judge to impose the maximum penalty," Stegall said. 
</P>
<P>
Stegall also urged people aware of poaching activities to phone CalTIP at 1 
(800) 952-5400, the DFG or any law enforcement agency with descriptions of the 
suspects and their vehicles, including license numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The birds, taken to reduce South Dakota's surplus population, were selected at 
a ratio of 3 to 1, gobblers to hens. Left alone, Massie said, the 89 birds near 
Big Bear should multiply to 500 by June, 2,000 in 1990 and 5,000 in '91. 
Meanwhile, anyone hunting bearded gobblers the first year should avoid birds 
wearing half-inch aluminum bands around one leg, marking them as breeders. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can see the beard, they should be able to see the band," Massie said. 
"It would would be better if people just took jakes (young males) for a while." 
</P>
<P>
The Cherry Valley Archers covered the $1,823 cost to transport the birds in a 
single stake truck. One bird escaped in Rapid City, another in Sacramento and 
two were DOA. If the flocks prosper, California hunters are in for a table 
treat, Massie said. 
</P>
<P>
"Wild turkeys are all excellent eating," he said. "They are juicier, with no 
fat. I'd say comparing a wild turkey to one you'd buy in the supermarket is 
like comparing a fresh pineapple to canned pineapple." 
</P>
<P>
Attention, Hunt Saboteurs, Earth First! and other wildlife enthusiasts. 
Volunteers are needed by the DFG, U.S. Forest Service and Society for the 
Conservation of Bighorn Sheep for the annual population survey of bighorns the 
weekend of March 11-12, focusing on the Lytle Creek area of the San Gabriel 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
DFG wildlife biologist Jon Fischer said there will be an orientation meeting at 
the Lytle Creek Ranger Station at 7 p.m. Saturday. Volunteers will hike to 
observation points at 6:30 a.m. Sunday. Some camping facilities are available 
nearby, but volunteers are advised to bring suitable clothing, footwear and 
water. Children under 14 and pets will not be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
The Hunt Saboteurs and Earth First! demonstrators, expressing concern for the 
animals, have attempted to disrupt the limited hunt of nine bighorns in the 
eastern Mojave Desert the last two years but have not been involved in survey, 
transplant or habitat-improvement projects designed to benefit the bighorns. 
</P>
<P>
"We would welcome them (for the survey), providing their intentions are to help 
with the survey and not to disrupt it in any way," Fischer said. "This 
population is not in an area we're looking at for hunting. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an excellent opportunity for members of the public to contribute to 
wildlife conservation efforts in Southern California."

ANGEL NOTEBOOK;

<P>
RADER GIVES HIS PLAYERS AN HONEST WORKOUT 
</P>

<P>
That oasis of tranquility known as Camp Rader -- no holdouts, walkouts, 
controversies or season-shattering injuries so far -- turned intense Tuesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
For new Manager Doug Rader's Angels, the day began with a 3 1/2-hour workout, 
featuring baserunning instruction by track coach Kevin McNair and crash courses 
on bunt defense and pickoff plays. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a three-hour, nine-inning intra-squad game in 90-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
Then came more voluntary instruction with McNair, which translated into a 
seven-hour practice session for some players. 
</P>
<P>
"That may be the longest workout in Angel history," observed a sun-scorched Tim 
Mead, Angel publicist and keeper of such records. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody in camp was willing, or able, to contest that claim. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we had a lot of work to get in," Rader said. "Still do. We've got 
another long one set for (today)." 
</P>
<P>
If this was to be an endurance test, Rader seemed pleased with the results, 
particularly when he watched veteran outfielders Chili Davis and Claudell 
Washington enlist for the postgame session with McNair. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people are setting a very fine example," Rader said. "I didn't see 
anything disappointing today. Everything was a plus. 
</P>
<P>
"All the effort that went into it, all the things that were done well. There 
was not one negative out there." 
</P>
<P>
Rader mentioned the pitching of Kirk McCaskill and Mike Fetters as highlights 
of the intra-squad game. McCaskill, recuperating from the arm injury that 
sidelined him for the last two months of the 1988 season, threw two scoreless 
innings, and Fetters, the club's No. 1 draft choice in 1986, impressed Rader 
with a consistently lively fastball. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike Fetters did a very good job," Rader said. "He had very good command of 
his pitches and above-average stuff across the board." 
</P>
<P>
Rader was vocal throughout the game, most often imploring his pitchers to work 
more quickly and cut the lag time between pitches. 
</P>
<P>
That makes for faster baseball -- and, according to Rader, better baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I want people to get in sync -- get the ball and put it play," he said. "The 
games that are so prolonged, I don't know why it's got to be that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it takes the edge off when a pitcher takes so much time on the mound. 
You show that much indecision and I think it adds to the confidence of the 
person you're competing against. Even if it's not indecision, it still projects 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
So, Tuesday's lessons were simple ones for the Angels. Long practices are good, 
long baseball games are bad. 
</P>
<P>
And just to make sure the point got across, they'll do it one more time today. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Because of Jim Abbott's hamstring injury, the Angels were short a pitcher for 
Tuesday's intra-squad game, so Urbano Lugo wound up pitching both halves of the 
ninth inning. He also wound up with the save -- and the loss. The score was 
tied, 2-2, when Lugo allowed a one-run double by outfielder Marcus Lawton and a 
run-scoring hit by catcher Darrell Miller in the top of the ninth. Then, in the 
bottom of the ninth, Lugo retired the side without surrendering a run, saving 
the 4-2 victory for pitcher of record Carl Willis. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott's injury didn't stop him from throwing in the bullpen, and he is 
expected to take his scheduled turn against San Diego in Friday's B game. 
"Today was purely preventive," Manager Doug Rader said. "He'll pitch Friday." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin McNair's running seminar went over big with the Angels, with several 
improving their home-to-first base sprint times. After one session, Wally 
Joyner had sliced two-tenths of a second off his regular time to first. 
McNair's two-day visit ends today, but Rader plans to extend the coach another 
invitation. "We didn't want to shove it down the players' throats," Rader said. 
"We just wanted to see how it worked out. Now, I think we'll bring him back 
when we get to Palm Springs." 
</P>
<P>
Rookie pitcher Vinicio Cedeno agreed to terms for the 1989 season, reducing the 
Angels' list of unsigned players to six. Club Vice President Mike Port has set 
Friday, the start of the exhibition season, as his cut-off for contract 
negotiations. Any players unsigned then will have their contracts automatically 
renewed, Port said.

Blue Cross of California: The Woodland Hills-based health insurer reported a 
1988 loss of $9.1 million, considerbly less than the $56-million loss it 
reported a year ago. For the fourth quarter, Blue Cross posted a $15.9-million 
profit, compared to $41.9 million in the 1987 period, which included an 
extraordinary gain from the sale of a building. Leonard D. Schaeffer, president 
and chief executive, hailed the results as a turnaround, which he attributed to 
"increasing sales, improving customer service and reducing staffing, 
administrative expenses and claims processing time."

United Brands Co.: The Cincinnati-based food producer said 1988 net income 
edged up to a record $60.4 million from $59.4 million in 1987. Sales increased 
to $3.5 billion from $3.3 billion. The firm said 1988 results were held down by 
costs of moving its Chiquita Brands and John Morrell headquarters to Cincinnati 
and by higher interest expense resulting from the issuance of $212.5 million in

ZENITH, AT&amp;T JOIN TO DEVELOP HIGH-DEFINITION TELEVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zenith, the only U.S. maker of television sets, and AT&amp;T said Tuesday that 
they have teamed up to develop a high-definition television system. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing concerns that foreign competitors are winning the race to develop 
HDTV equipment, Zenith Chairman Jerry Pearlman predicted that the partnership 
would yield "winning American technology" that will "allow the U.S. to leapfrog 
the Japanese and Europeans." 
</P>
<P>
Zenith and AT&amp;T were among 40 to submit high-definition television 
proposals to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, an arm of the 
Defense Department. The agency, which has earmarked $30 million for development 
of HDTV systems, is expected to award contracts in April. 
</P>
<P>
The identities of the other companies competing for government funding couldn't 
be learned late Tuesday. However, industry sources said IBM, Tandy, Sun 
Microsystems and SRI International were known to have at least considered a 
proposal. The deadline for submitting proposals was Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It is encouraging to know there has been this kind of response," said Pat Hill 
Hubbard, vice president for science and technology policy for the American 
Electronics Assn. "We're very pleased." 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department, which uses HDTV technology in certain weapons systems, 
invited proposals for the technology last December. The department said it 
expected the technology to have consumer applications but that it would "by no 
means solve the HDTV problem." 
</P>
<P>
Some economists and electronics industry officials have expressed concern that 
unless U.S. firms catch up to Japanese competitors in HDTV development, this 
nation will lose out on another key consumer electronics market. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese started work on HDTV -- a wide-screen television with 
well-defined, color pictures -- in 1970. Since then, the Japanese have 
developed cameras, tape recorders and broadcasting equipment for the new 
high-definition format. Next year, high definition-television will become 
available to Japanese viewers. But the televisions will cost a lot -- about 
$4,000. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, 16 U.S. companies, including Zenith, IBM, Apple Computer and Texas 
Instruments, agreed to work on setting up a partnership to fund development of 
high-definition TV sets. Besides conducting research, the group would also 
license HDTV technology to other U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department said it will award $15 million for development of a 
device that will receive high-definition signals and another $15 million for a 
device that will display a high-definition picture. The two devices would 
ultimately provide the basis for an HDTV television set. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Bodanyi, a department spokeswoman, said the government would pick one 
proposal in each area, and possibly more. 
</P>
<P>
Zenith and AT&amp;T will work on developing the technology to receive the HDTV 
signals. The proposal asks for $13 million from the department. The total price 
tag would be $24 million, said Daniel S. Lankford, a vice president at AT&amp;T 
Microelectronics, one of the AT&amp;T units working on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Lankford said Zenith and AT&amp;T separately submitted proposals for developing 
a display screen, the HDTV equivalent of a picture tube. 
</P>
<P>
Lankford said that if AT&amp;T and Zenith failed to receive the government 
contract, research would continue, but more slowly. "We would have to 
reevaluate the time and resources devoted to the project," he said.

What does it mean that the nation's airlines and airplane manufacturers Tuesday 
asked the Federal Aviation Administration to order an $800-million repair 
program for aging airliners? 
</P>
<P>
In the short run, it means that flights will be even more crowded and demand 
for new airplanes will become even more intense because the greatest strain on 
the system is not aging aircraft -- although they're a problem -- but the 
expansion of the traveling public. 
</P>
<P>
On the safety side, the industry's new procedures will mean mandatory 
replacements of rivets and fuselage panels at intervals in an airplane's 
operating life, instead of frequent inspection and repair of such items. The 
industry's action came days after the accident on United Airlines Flight 811 
out of Honolulu took nine lives. And it follows a year of worrisome incidents 
involving cracks in airliners -- causing public concern and persuading the 
industry to openly demonstrate that it was stepping up its maintenance 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
But still people wonder why cracks are suddenly showing up. Is flying less safe 
these days? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Improved Safety Record 
</P>
<P>
No, the problem is one of wear and tear on older planes; it is being dealt with 
and is not an emergency. Meanwhile, the overriding truth of air travel today is 
that there are more flights but fewer accidents. In 1977, the year before 
deregulation, scheduled airlines flew 4.9 million flights on 2,700 airliners in 
the United States. Last year there were 7 million flights and 4,300 airplanes. 
That's a 43% increase in flights but a 59% increase in airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
The average age of planes was 10 years then, is 12 years today -- although some 
planes are almost 20 years old, like the United 747 in Honolulu. Still accident 
totals are down: four U.S. accidents a year involving fatalities in the early 
1980s, three a year for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that insurance rates actually have eased a little, say airline 
insurance people. The insurance of airliners is a group affair with insurance 
companies forming syndicates to spread the risk, and perhaps $1.5 billion in 
premiums per year insuring the world's total of 7,800 airliners. 
</P>
<P>
Were the insurers worried about aging aircraft? Not really, says Daniel Izard, 
president of Associated Aviation Underwriters, one of the major U.S. groups. 
"Age is only one of the many factors we consider," Izard says. Others include 
size of aircraft, number of takeoffs and landings in its route structure and 
the airline's record on maintenance. (United Airlines, say industry experts, 
has an extraordinarily good record on maintenance.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planes Retired Early 
</P>
<P>
But the question of aging airliners doesn't arise immediately because in theory 
airliners have an indefinite life. Their operating parts, engines and such, 
have always been replaced at regular intervals -- the equivalent of replacing 
the brakes, transmission or engine on a car. The outer skin of the plane -- the 
rivets and plates -- have been inspected and patched at regular intervals but 
not totally replaced. Now those parts will be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, though, airplanes have come to the end of their economic lives 
before reaching the end of their operating lives. That is, they were retired 
when, like the Boeing 707, they were no longer as fuel-efficient as newer 
models or their old configurations and engines made them too noisy for new 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
And that's the problem. It used to be that new models and new technology came 
along more often, causing old airliners to be scrapped. That was when 
development costs of a new plane were moderate and manufacturers could sell the 
new planes for a reasonable price. But development costs today are prohibitive. 
Developing a whole new airplane would cost $2.5 billion, which would result in 
a price per plane of about $35 million. And airlines are reluctant to pay it, 
when their problem is not to get a new type of aircraft whether for fuel 
efficiency or greater speed or whatever. Their problem is to get enough planes 
to handle the growing passenger traffic worldwide. That is why airlines have 
ordered enough aircraft to back up the production lines of Boeing, McDonnell 
Douglas and Airbus Industrie. That is why they are flying all their planes 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
And the mandatory programs proposed Tuesday will further strain the system 
because they will produce increased downtime for maintenance and thus a 
scarcity of available seats. Demand will become even more intense for new 
planes from the manufacturers, all of whom are trying to stretch their 
production capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Summing up, the alarming appearance of fuselage cracks and the industry's 
response to the alarm are one episode in the short, 30-year history of 
commercial jet travel. But we should keep in mind that behind that episode is 
the far more encouraging reality of growing passenger traffic and rising living 
standards worldwide.

RJR SMOKELESS CIGARETTE TEST IS SNUFFED OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "smokeless" cigarette developed by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. at an 
estimated cost of more than $300 million has been at least temporarily dropped 
after five months of testing in several cities, company officials said Tuesday. 
Most smokers apparently did not like Premier's taste or smell. 
</P>
<P>
"Very simply, it did not perform as we hoped it would in the test market," said 
David Fishel, senior vice president of public relations at R. J. Reynolds, a 
subsidiary of RJR Nabisco. That test market was limited mostly to the cities of 
Phoenix, Tucson, Ariz., and St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Winston-Salem, N. C., company has left open the option of some day 
reintroducing an improved version of the cigarette -- which heats tobacco but 
does not actually burn it. "All we're doing is discontinuing the test market," 
Fishel said. "We may reintroduce it, or something like it, at another time." 
</P>
<P>
The Premier cigarette was designed to reduce smoke released into the air and 
appease the anti-smoking movement. But the product had the opposite effect, 
with health groups objecting to what they saw as an effort to make smoking more 
acceptable without addressing health concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only did the cigarette pose possible serious dangers to smokers, but to 
nonsmokers as well," said John F. Banzhaf, executive director of the 
Washington-based consumer group, Action on Smoking &amp; Health. "After all, it 
did not have any smoke, which is the one warning that ordinary cigarettes give 
to nonsmokers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern About Ads 
</P>
<P>
The American Medical Assn. expressed delight at RJR's move. "The American 
public has the right to expect that the products they consume have been judged 
safe for human consumption before being placed on shelves for sale," AMA 
Executive Vice President James H. Sammons said in a statement. Last year, the 
AMA asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to ban sales of the cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
"If they hadn't pulled it off the market, there would have been a regulatory 
brouhaha," said Dave Stewart, professor of marketing at USC. Stewart recently 
consulted with Federal Trade Commission officials who were concerned that 
advertisements that positioned Premier as a cigarette with a "cleaner smoke" 
were misleading. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, RJR -- which makes the Winston, Salem and Camel brands -- said it 
will continue to test-market two other unusual cigarettes that were introduced 
to a few cities in recent weeks. One, which is rolled in special paper and 
appears to emit less smoke than most other brands, is called Vantage Excel. The 
other, Chelsea, is said to have somewhat of a vanilla taste. 
</P>
<P>
For RJR Nabisco, which earlier this month was acquired by the New York 
investment firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. for a record $25 billion, 
the move to drop Premier is viewed by some analysts as a setback. Just five 
months ago, RJR officials openly discussed spending more than $1 billion to 
roll out the brand nationally. 
</P>
<P>
"Most analysts were expecting this," said Sarah A. Sheckler, vice president at 
the Chicago investment firm Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. "I'm a smoker. I tried it. 
And like most other people, I didn't like the taste, either." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly RJR is not the first major company to face a setback with a new 
product line. In fact, marketing executives say that fewer than one in seven 
new products are successful. Coca-Cola was forced to put Classic Coke back on 
the shelves alongside its new formula after a consumer backlash. Even Procter 
&amp; Gamble's relatively new orange juice line, Citrus Hill, has not met the 
company's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts even credit RJR for jumping out far ahead of the 
competition in its testing of new cigarette products. "It was a very bold 
experiment but it didn't work," said Lawrence Adelman, senior vice president at 
the New York investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "Their failure could 
dissuade others from making it." 
</P>
<P>
"If RJR had been successful with Premier," said USC marketing professor 
Stewart, "every manufacturer would have soon come out with a smokeless 
cigarette. This means it's back to the drawing boards for all of them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plenty to Say 
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for RJR's chief rival, Philip Morris, denied that his company 
was preparing to market a smokeless cigarette. What is more, he declined to 
comment on the Premier brand. "Our policy is not to comment on RJR or anything 
that the competition does," spokesman Steve Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
But Charles Crow had plenty to say about Premier. 
</P>
<P>
Crow's company, Grand Candy &amp; Tobacco Co., is a big distributor of 
cigarettes in St. Louis, where Premier has been test-marketed. He delivered the 
cigarettes to retailers ranging from local tobacco shops to major grocery 
chains. 
</P>
<P>
"It was evident to anyone who handled it that it was a loser from the word go," 
Crow said. "I bet you that after that first week's delivery, I didn't have one 
reorder on the product." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Crow says that he will soon be shipping back thousands of dollars 
worth of Premier cigarettes to RJR. "I never saw a cigarette that had so much 
consumer interest before it came out," he said. "But I tell you, I tried the 
cigarette and it was terrible. It made me nauseous for the rest of the day."

Farm Prices Drop: Prices received by the nation's farmers fell 0.7% in February 
after a rise of 1.4% last month, the Agriculture Department said. Lower prices 
for soybeans, lettuce, milk and corn were offset slightly by higher prices for 
tomatoes, strawberries, potatoes, hay and the highest prices for wheat since 
since April, 1981, the department said in its monthly report. The report 
indicates that inflation may be easing, as lower prices received by farmers are 
usually reflected in lower consumer food prices. But it can be months before 
the savings are passed on to the public.

Cost of Making Commercials: The average original television commercial in 1987 
cost $145,600 to produce, a benchmark study by an advertising agency trade 
group says. The study's backers say the methods developed for compiling its 
latest report will give the ad industry a recognized standard against which it 
can measure from year to year what is driving commercial production costs. The 
American Assn. of Advertising Agencies said its new report was based on a 
computerized study of production costs for 2,042 commercials submitted by 22 ad 
agencies.

Potato Chip Shortage Seen: Potato chips may be in short supply for a few weeks 
this spring because of a record freeze that heavily damaged northeast Florida's 
potato crop, industry experts predict. The potato chip industry had been 
counting on an early and abundant supply of potatoes from this area to 
replenish dwindling stocks, said Harold Willingham, southeastern area field 
manager for Frito-Lay Inc. But now the freeze has turned what was expected to 
be a bonanza into a season of gloom for potato farmers. The 26,000 acres of 
potatoes in St. Johns, Putnam and Flagler counties in northeast Florida fill a 
niche in the supply of chip potatoes for a few weeks each spring because they 
come in earlier than in other areas.

MILKENS CANNOT HALT DREXEL PLEA BARGAIN, U.S. PROSECUTORS CLAIM 
</P>

NEW YORK

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal prosecutors claimed Tuesday that Drexel Burnham Lambert's "junk bond" 
chief Michael Milken and his brother, Lowell Milken, don't have any legal right 
to prevent Drexel from entering into a plea agreement that would deprive the 
brothers of their jobs and many millions of dollars in compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York suggested that the brothers sue 
Drexel in civil court if they believe that any contractual rights to their jobs 
or bonuses have been violated. 
</P>
<P>
The statements were made in court documents filed in response to the Milken 
brothers' challenge to the plea agreement. The agreement, which hasn't been put 
into effect, would require Drexel to plead guilty to six criminal charges and 
pay $650 million in penalties. The agreement with prosecutors is to go into 
effect only after Drexel settles separate civil charges filed by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suspension and Firing 
</P>
<P>
The tentative plea agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office, made public Jan. 
25, also would require Drexel to fire Michael Milken immediately and withhold 
his 1988 bonus, estimated at up to $200 million. It would require the firm to 
suspend Lowell Milken -- also an employee of the high-yield, or junk bond, 
department in Beverly Hills -- if he is indicted on criminal charges and 
withhold half of the total compensation he was owed for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The court papers disclosed for the first time that Lowell Milken's bonus and 
salary for 1988 would have totaled at least $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
Both brothers are expected to be indicted on racketeering and securities fraud 
charges stemming from their activities at Drexel. But no criminal charges have 
been filed yet, and both have denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on the Milkens' objection to the plea agreement has been scheduled 
for March 14 before U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood. 
</P>
<P>
The court documents filed Tuesday didn't shed any light on why the U.S. 
Attorney's Office insisted that the actions against the Milken brothers be 
included in Drexel's plea agreement. Prosecutors so far haven't offered an 
explanation. Instead, in the court filing, the prosecutors concentrated on the 
narrow legal argument that the brothers don't have any standing to interfere 
with a plea agreement voluntarily entered into by Drexel with the government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plea Called Voluntary 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors refuted claims made by the Milkens' lawyers that the provisions 
amounted to unconstitutional action by the government to deprive individuals of 
their property. In the court papers, the assistant U.S. attorneys argued that 
because Drexel was entering into the plea agreement voluntarily, it is Drexel 
and not the government that would be taking the steps against the Milkens. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel Chief Executive Frederick H. Joseph, in an affidavit filed Tuesday with 
the government's papers, confirmed that Drexel's board had voluntarily decided 
to enter into the plea agreement. But 2 1/2 weeks ago, a Drexel spokesman had 
claimed that the provisions concerning the Milkens' compensation "were not 
volunteered by Drexel." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors also claimed Tuesday that the brothers don't have any 
employment contract that gives them a right to their jobs or fixes the amounts 
of their bonuses. They assert, too, that the brothers' lawyers haven't 
presented evidence showing why they are owed the money. The prosecutors said 
the Milkens haven't "described what work, if any, they did for Drexel in 1988 
that would justify their staggering compensation claims." 
</P>
<P>
The Milkens' lawyers in their own earlier court papers had claimed that the 
amounts of the bonuses were established by formulas fixed by contractual 
agreements with Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confirms Situation 
</P>
<P>
But the prosecutors claimed that the only formula at Drexel is one that 
determines how much of the firm's overall yearly bonus pool goes to the 
high-yield department. After that, the papers claim, it has always been up to 
Michael Milken to determine how much each individual gets, including himself 
and his brother. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors' court filing also included an affidavit from Joseph confirming 
that the Milkens don't have a written employment contract. 
</P>
<P>
A personal spokesman for Michael Milken said his lawyers were still reviewing 
the government's papers, filed late Tuesday, and wouldn't have any immediate 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Armstrong, Lowell Milken's lawyer, said: "We are studying it and we'll 
reply at the appropriate time."

TRADE DEFICIT SWELLS TO $32 BILLION IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>

<P>
The U.S. trade deficit worsened in the final three months of the year, climbing 
to $32 billion, as U.S. exports and imports hit record levels, the government 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the deficit from October through December swelled 
10% from a third-quarter deficit of $29.17 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit had shown steady improvement through the first three quarters 
of 1988, helping to push the deficit for the entire year down to $126.5 
billion, 21.7% below the all-time high of $160.28 billion set in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Although economists were pleased with the big improvement for the year, they 
expressed fears that the improvement has stalled and will hold back overall 
economic growth in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"The trade deficit has stopped improving," said David Wyss, an economist with 
Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass. "We made some big gains in exports in 
1987 and 1988, but they haven't been enough to balance our big appetite for 
imports." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's figures confirmed an improvement noted in the Commerce Department's 
monthly merchandise trade reports. Those figures showed the deficit declining 
to $137.34 billion in 1988, down from $170.3 billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The new report, which measures trade on a balance-of-payments basis, has 
smaller figures because it subtracts shipping costs and military sales. 
</P>
<P>
Another measure of trade, contained in the report on the gross national product 
released Tuesday, also showed a worsening in the deficit for fourth quarter 
1988. Unlike the other trade figures, the GNP report removes the effects of 
inflation from the import and export numbers.

GNP GROWTH SLOWS TO 2%; TRADE AND DROUGHT CITED

The economy grew at a lackluster annual rate of 2% in the final three months of 
1988, the slowest pace in two years, reflecting a worsening trade deficit and 
the lingering effects of the summer drought, the government said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the slowdown in the gross national product, the 
total output of goods and services, was accompanied by a pickup in the 
inflation rate as food prices and the costs of imports both rose. 
</P>
<P>
While the 2% overall growth figure was unchanged from an initial report a month 
ago, economists labeled the new GNP statistics disturbing because of the 
weakness in trade, the speedup in inflation and an acceleration of consumer 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
"The shape of the economy looks worse than we thought," said David Wyss, senior 
financial economist for Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass. "All the 
changes were in the wrong direction." 
</P>
<P>
Economists were concerned because the new GNP report showed that the country's 
trade imbalance worsened even more than previously estimated during the fourth 
quarter as imports grew at an annual rate of 13%, swamping a 7% gain in 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending rose at a robust 3.5% annual rate, too fast given current 
constraints on production resulting from tight labor markets and high operating 
rates, economists said. The jump in consumer spending, which went primarily to 
big-ticket items such as cars, also showed that Americans' appetite for foreign 
goods is unabated. 
</P>
<P>
"The surge in consumption pulled in more imports with the result that the 
deterioration in the trade deficit was worse than previously assumed," said 
Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Assn. of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the second consecutive quarter that the GNP trade deficit worsened 
and served to emphasize economists' contention that America's trade woes are a 
long way from being solved. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-quarter GNP increase followed a 2.5% third-quarter rise and was the 
slowest quarterly increase since a 1.4% rate in the final three months of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-quarter figure was depressed by the lingering effects of last 
summer's drought.

PEOPLE: GLOBUS TO STAY ON AS CHAIRMAN OF CANNON UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yoram Globus will remain with Cannon Group, serving as chairman and chief 
executive of the Cannon Entertainment subsidiary as well as an officer and 
director of the parent firm. 
</P>
<P>
A day earlier the company had announced that Globus' longtime associate at 
Cannon, Menahem Golan, had resigned his posts to start a new movie production 
firm with $160 million of Cannon financing. Golan and Globus headed the Los 
Angeles-based movie company from 1979 until last April, when its new European 
backers, led by Florio Fiorini and Giancarlo Parretti, took control. 
</P>
<P>
Globus, who will serve on the parent's executive committee with Fiorini and 
Parretti, said he was glad to be working with them to put together "a major 
motion picture company." The Fiorini-Parretti group recently started Pathe 
Entertainment with Alan Ladd Jr. as chairman and agreed to buy New World 
Entertainment.

US SPRINT REPORTEDLY SEEKING STAKE IN CABLE ACROSS ATLANTIC 
</P>

<P>
US Sprint Communications Co., hoping to expand its role in the international 
long-distance market, is negotiating to buy a stake in the first private 
telecommunications cable linking the United States and Europe, industry sources 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
US Sprint hopes to acquire Private Transatlantic Telecommunications System 
Inc., a privately held company based in McLean, Va., that is building the 
transatlantic cable, called PTAT-1, in a joint venture with Cable &amp; 
Wireless PLC, a British-based communications firm. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the deal would significantly bolster US Sprint's international 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
US Sprint's linkup with Cable &amp; Wireless is a blow to New York-based Nynex 
Corp., which has sought for two years to buy a 50% stake in PTAT-1. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Harold Greene rejected Nynex's request 
for a waiver of the rules that restrict the Bell companies from offering 
long-distance services. Greene oversees the Bell companies as part of the 1984 
breakup of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. 
</P>
<P>
Nynex could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The domestic long-distance market is growing about 10% a year, but 
international calling volume is increasing at a rate at least twice as large. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said US Sprint, a unit of United Telecommunications Inc., would 
benefit by offering its customers connections to Britain and other parts of 
Europe through Cable &amp; Wireless' Mercury Communications subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, Mercury's subscribers would have access to the United States over 
US Sprint's domestic fiber-optic network. 
</P>
<P>
PTAT-1, the $600-million PTAT/Cable &amp; Wireless cable, will carry voice and 
data calls in the form of laser-generated pulses of light on strands of glass 
cable laid across the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first transatlantic cable not built primarily by public phone 
companies and will compete with TAT-8, a system owned by AT&amp;T and 
state-owned phone companies in Europe, Canada and Australia. TAT-8 went into 
service in December.

DEMAND BY AIRLINES RISING; 
</P>
<P>
LEASING FIRM TO PAY $1 BILLION FOR NEW JETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
International Lease Finance Corp. of Beverly Hills said Tuesday that it has 
agreed to buy 17 new jetliners for $1.05 billion, reflecting growing demand by 
commercial airlines for leased aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
ILFC said it expects to pay about $730 million to Boeing Co. for five 767-300 
carriers and seven smaller 757-200 jets. The firm has placed a separate 
$320-million order with Airbus Industrie, a European consortium based in 
Toulouse, France, for three A330 twin-engine widebodies and two smaller 
A320-200 jets. 
</P>
<P>
The orders are ILFC's largest since the firm agreed last May to buy 100 Boeing 
and 30 Airbus aircraft for $5.04 billion, its largest purchase ever. 
</P>
<P>
ILFC executives said the new orders are attributable to increasing use of 
leased jets to supplement the aging fleets of major airlines as well as recent 
tax law changes that make leasing more attractive than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"These are highly fuel-efficient, noise-compliant, advanced-technology 
jetliners designed to meet the growing airline demand," said ILFC President 
Steven F. Udvar-Hazy. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the 12 Boeing planes are to be delivered from 1993 through 
1995, and the Airbus deliveries will begin in 1992 and end in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing's production schedules have become an issue within the industry because 
some deliveries of its 747-400 jumbo jets -- including one ordered by ILFC -- 
have been delayed. But ILFC executives said they expect Boeing to meet its 
delivery schedule on its latest order. 
</P>
<P>
Late delivery of aircraft was a major cause of a 15% decline in net income 
recorded by ILFC for 1988, according to the company's executives. ILFC, the 
second largest of three companies dominating the aircraft leasing business, 
reported net income of $43.4 million on revenue of $213.2 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Daugherty, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, said ILFC is 
willing to place large orders with Boeing because other aircraft manufacturers 
-- McDonnell Douglas, for example -- were late in delivering planes to the 
firm. ILFC had a fleet of about 60 planes last year and could have leased more 
planes if suppliers had met schedule deadlines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to satisfy an insatiable appetite for airliners," Daugherty 
said. "But a number of producers are having problems. It's a sign of the 
times." 
</P>
<P>
Airline leasing demand has doubled since the federal tax reform act of 1986 
eliminated the investment tax credit, removing an incentive for many airlines 
to buy their own jets, said Daniel Hersh, an analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill 
Richards in Los Angeles. Worldwide, about 30% of all planes in airline fleets 
are leased, Hersh said.

<P>
AME TO BUILD A HOSPITAL, EXPAND A SECOND ONE

Affiliated Medical Enterprises of Orange plans to expand its Pacifica Community 
Hospital in Huntington Beach with a $20-million, five-story extension and will 
build a new $40-million hospital in Palmdale to replace Palmdale Hospital 
Medical Center, company officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, they'll be building brand-new hospitals to replace the hospitals 
that they have," said John Weir, a hospital spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The existing Palmdale hospital will be bulldozed or converted to other use. The 
existing Huntington Beach hospital will be remodeled, joined to the new 
building and used to house women's health services, including delivery rooms, a 
nursery for newborns and a geriatric care area. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacifica project will increase the hospital's capacity to 161 beds from 
109. Construction should be completed in 1992. The new Palmdale building, which 
will increase capacity to 180 beds from 123, is scheduled to open in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
When Affiliated was founded in 1986, it operated one hospital, the 116-bed Ojai 
Valley Community Hospital in Ojai. In 1988, it bought American Health Group 
International Inc. of Kirkland, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
The $100-million acquisition brought the company up to five hospitals and one 
home health-care company. The facilities purchased in 1988 were Pacifica 
Hospital of the Valley in Sun Valley, Palmdale Hospital Medical Center, 
Pacifica Community Hospital, Roosevelt Hospital in Portales, N.M., and 
Evergreen Home Health Care Inc. in Burbank.

The dollar turned narrowly mixed in quiet trading Tuesday after the government 
released its latest data on economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices rose slightly after falling overseas. Republic National Bank of New 
York said gold was bid at $387 an ounce at 4 p.m. EST, up 50 cents from 
Monday's late bid. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the dollar finished higher overseas and opened firmer in domestic 
trading, but it lost ground after the Commerce Department reported that the 
economy grew at a lackluster annual rate of 2% in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in the gross national product, the total output of goods and 
services, was accompanied by a pickup in the inflation rate as food prices and 
the costs of imports rose, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"The GNP figures were a little bit lower than expected," said George DeLuna, a 
trader with Irving Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
He said the dollar also was held in check by marketwide fears of central bank 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
"The central banks have the markets well under control here," DeLuna said. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
rose 1.15 Japanese yen to close at 127.15 yen. It was quoted lower in London at 
126.70 yen but at 126.89 yen in New York, up from 126.775 yen. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained against the British pound in London but fell in New York. It 
cost $1.7430 to buy one pound in London, cheaper than $1.7440 late Monday. 
Sterling fetched $1.7430 in New York, up from $1.73795. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to Monday's levels, included: 
1.82275 West German marks, down from 1.82435; 1.5549 Swiss francs, up from 
1.5530; 1.19925 Canadian dollars, down from 1.20325; 6.2035 French francs, down 
from 6.2070, and 1,341.75 Italian lire, down from 1,343.00. 
</P>
<P>
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared to Monday, included: 1.8230 West German 
marks, up from 1.8150; 1.5535 Swiss francs, up from 1.5495; 6.1975 French 
francs, up from 6.1775; 2.0555 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0490; 1.2005 Canadian 
dollars, down from 1.2025, and 1,341.50 Italian lire, up from 1,339.62. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery closed 
at $387.50, up 20 cents from Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $386.75, compared to late Monday's $389. 
In Zurich, Switzerland, gold closed at $387.15, down from $390.25. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $4.09 to close at $388.85. 
</P>
<P>
Silver bullion prices fell. On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery 
declined to $5.822 from $5.845 on Monday. Silver fell in London to $5.86 from 
$5.93.

HEALTH FILE: SMELLING TROUBLE AFTER RADIATION TREATMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: The husband of a friend of mine had radiation treatments, and now my 
friend says that things don't smell the same to him any more. Could this have 
been caused by the treatments, or is it just a coincidence? Does this usually 
happen in such cases? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The use of radiation in cancers of the head and neck has been reported 
to affect the sense of smell. Many patients experience some improvement a few 
months after treatment, but some residual impairment is often the rule. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Two of my friends have had to have hysterectomies, and their reactions to it 
have been as different as night and day. One of them is acting as if the world 
has come to an end, while the other one has told me that she looks on it as if 
she had to have a tooth extracted. How can you account for this difference in 
attitude? 
</P>
<P>
A: A number of factors may help determine a woman's reaction to the need for a 
hysterectomy. For example, a 25-year-old childless woman may be more concerned 
about having a hysterectomy than a 55-year-old mother. The reason for the 
procedure and any complications associated with it may also influence the 
woman's attitude and reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Cultural factors also appear to play a role. The results of various studies 
have shown that women from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds show 
different degrees of anxiety and depression both before and after surgery. In 
addition, women who were better educated appeared to tolerate the procedure 
better than did less well educated women.

An Associated Press report published Sunday incompletely described the verdict 
in the court-martial of Marine 1st Lt. Allen Lawson. He was convicted of 
dereliction of duty, of appearing drunk and of disobeying an order. The charges 
stemmed from the death of Lance Cpl. Jason Rother, who had been left behind in 
the Mojave Desert during a training exercise.

PEGGY BUCKEY'S 1ST DAY AT SCHOOL STIRS UP PROTESTERS

Former McMartin Pre-School defendant Peggy Ann Buckey was greeted by protesters 
today as she arrived at her new job at the Anaheim Union High School District's 
Trident Center, where she is to teach two students. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen protesters from an Orange County coalition of victims' rights and 
child advocacy groups waved placards reading "Crime Victims Say No to Buckey" 
and other slogans as teachers and students arrived at the alternative school in 
Anaheim. Buckey slipped into her new classroom before 7:30 a.m. and avoided a 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not saying she's guilty. We're not saying she's innocent. We're saying 
she's suspect," said Howard Garber, director of the Citizens Anti-Crime Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
He was joined by representatives of the Orange County Citizens Against Child 
Abuse, Young Citizens for Law and Order, National Exchange Club for the 
Prevention of Child Abuse, Fullerton Citizens for Decency and National 
Coalition Against Pornography. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, 32, who successfully fought to regain her teaching credentials after 
all molestation and conspiracy charges against her were dropped in 1986, will 
teach a small class of high school students with learning and communication 
disorders.

WEBSTER SEES WIDE THREAT IN LIBYA CHEMICAL PLANT

<P>
CIA Director William H. Webster said today that Libyan strongman Moammar 
Kadafi's chemical weapons plant is so big that he could easily share its output 
with other radical nations. 
</P>
<P>
"The production capability is far more than Col. Kadafi could ever need or use 
by any stretch of the imagination," Webster told the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this going to become just another form of currency . . . a brokering 
capability?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Webster also said Libya could have the capacity to target such countries as 
Israel with chemical weapons if Kadafi's forces obtain air-to-air refueling 
capacity for their bombers. 
</P>
<P>
"It moves it (the chemical weapons threat) off the battlefields and puts it 
into the cities and strategic areas" of the whole Middle East, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Webster was asked by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) if elements of the West German 
armed forces had aided Libyan efforts to obtain air-to-air refueling 
capability. 
</P>
<P>
Webster said he would prefer to discuss the matter in a closed, non-public 
session but told Helms, "You're right on target." 
</P>
<P>
Webster later declined to elaborate on his comment. 
</P>
<P>
Kadafi has said the plant was built to produce pharmaceuticals, not chemical 
weapons. Webster said that even if that is true the facility could be converted 
to manufacture weapons within a day's time. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA director did say, as he and other U.S. officials have said before, that 
West German corporations as well as those from other European and Asian 
countries have helped Libya acquire a chemical weapons production capability, 
and that it "would have been virtually impossible" for Libya to do that without 
such help.

TOWER CHALLENGES SENATORS TO CHECK THEIR OWN MORALS;

PENTAGON NOMINEE FIGHTS BACK

<P>
A combative John Tower said today that senators questioning his fitness to be 
defense secretary should look to their own moral standards. 
</P>
<P>
The embattled Tower unleashed a two-fisted defense of his own character and 
counterattacks against his critics shortly before the Senate was expected to 
formally begin debate on his nomination, which Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.) declared against today. 
</P>
<P>
Tower made clear that he and President Bush have no intention of withdrawing 
the nomination, quoting the last words of fellow Texan Col. William Travis in 
the 19th-Century battle of the Alamo: "I shall never surrender or retreat." 
</P>
<P>
Travis and all the American defenders were wiped out by the Mexican army that 
besieged and eventually overran them at the Alamo, and the battle has become 
synonymous with gallantry but also with losing causes. 
</P>
<P>
Tower later said the comparison was unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
Tower, under attack like no Cabinet nominee in memory on allegations of alcohol 
abuse, womanizing and close ties to defense contractors, made his feisty 
comments in response to questions during an appearance at the National Press 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is bothered that there is "no clearly defined standard against which 
I could be judged. The standards seemed to evolve to fit the situation." 
</P>
<P>
"I accept that the secretary of defense must adhere to a higher standard," 
Tower said. But he added, pointedly, "My question is, how much lower an 
acceptable standard is there for members of the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
"Is it an acceptable standard for senators, late in the evening, who've had a 
few drinks in the hideaways and offices of the Capitol a few steps away from 
the Senate chamber, to come on the floor and vote on vital issues of nuclear 
deterrence?" Tower asked, pulling into the open the well-known -- but little 
discussed -- fact that a number of lawmakers have appeared inebriated on the 
Senate floor over the years. 
</P>
<P>
In a response to suggestions of conflict of interest, Tower posed this 
question: "Is it an acceptable standard for senators to accept honoraria, PAC 
(political action committee) contributions and paid vacations from special 
interests, who have a vested interest in the legislative process?" 
</P>
<P>
"I think . . . it is time Congress articulated what its own standards are," 
said Tower, who served more than two decades in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The twice-divorced Tower repeated his vow to swear off drinking altogether if 
confirmed, and in a tart reply to a question about whether he had broken vows 
in the past -- specifically, his wedding vows -- said: "As a matter of fact, I 
have broken wedding vows. I think I am probably not alone in that connection." 
</P>
<P>
While he dealt directly with the issues threatening to derail his nomination, 
Tower also showed his flare for cut-and-thrust humor. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he felt about the furor his nomination has caused, Tower replied: "I 
feel a little bit like the fellow that had been immersed in tar and feathers 
and was being ridden out of town on a rail, and he said, 'Really, gentlemen, if 
it weren't for the honor, I'd rather hitchhike.' "

NORTH KNEW HE WAS BOUND BY LAW -- SINGLAUB

A retired general testified at Oliver L. North's trial today that he and the 
former Marine lieutenant colonel decided in 1985 "to assume the worst" -- that 
North's actions were covered by a law forbidding official U.S. aid to the 
Nicaraguan resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, however, a prosecution witness, Robert W. Owen, testified 
that he made many trips between Washington and Central America for North, 
carrying instructions from the presidential aide for how the guerrilla war was 
to be fought, and carrying maps and money. 
</P>
<P>
Owen said North told him he acted with the knowledge and approval of superiors. 
The courier testified at one point that North said he had then-President Ronald 
Reagan's approval, but he said later that testimony was wrong, that North never 
got more specific than "superiors." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
General Not Restricted 
</P>
<P>
Retired Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub, an ardent anti-communist who directed spy 
activities in three wars, said he and North agreed their actions should be 
governed by the assumption that North was covered by the congressional Boland 
Amendment, meaning Singlaub would work with the Contras and North would merely 
be kept informed. 
</P>
<P>
The retired general helped raise millions of dollars for the Contras -- some 
from foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
Singlaub was the fourth witness in the trial which resumed despite serious, 
still-unresolved, national security issues that halted testimony for nearly two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. has renewed a motion to declare that a 
federal law designed to protect state secrets from being divulged in the 
courtroom is unconstitutional as applied to the North case.

SCHWALBACH AM TAUNUS, West Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with a public outcry, West Germany is about to tighten up the liberal 
asylum law that has attracted refugees from as near as Czechoslovakia and as 
far away as Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
More than 27,600 asylum-seekers arrived last year at the Schwalbach camp just 
outside Frankfurt, roughly one-quarter of the nationwide total. 
</P>
<P>
And they are still coming at a record pace, despite the controversy surrounding 
them and charges that many come not in search of freedom from political 
persecution but for their own economic betterment. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the asylum-seekers arriving at the Frankfurt airport are driven by bus 
to the state-run camp. West German officials said some people cross on foot 
over West Germany's southern borders. 
</P>
<P>
"Some Poles come here directly with their cars and say, 'Here I am,"' said 
Volker Moeser, the camp director. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the largest number of refugees have come from Turkey, 
followed in order by Sri Lanka, Poland, Iran, Afghanistan, India, Ghana, 
Yugoslavia, Somalia and Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Moeser said some of the refugees are aware of the heated political debate 
surrounding the political asylum issue. 
</P>
<P>
Asylum-seekers throughout the country occasionally are the targets of violence. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 14, unknown assailants firebombed a home for asylum-seekers in the 
northern Bavarian town of Memmelsdorf. Damage was minor, and none of the 15 
Poles and Hungarians inside were injured. 
</P>
<P>
A similar attack took place at a home for asylum-seekers in nearby Bamberg the 
following day. 
</P>
<P>
While violence still is limited, general dissatisfaction among Germans with the 
number of asylum-seekers continues to grow after the number hit 103,076 last 
year in this country of 61.3 million people.

BUSH 'DISRESPECTFUL' IN INVITING DISSIDENT TO DINNER, CHINA SAYS

China, in a sharp new rebuke to President Bush, said today that the President 
was disrespectful in inviting a leading dissident to a weekend dinner and it 
dismissed U.S criticism as "irresponsible remarks." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in three days China criticized the United States for the 
incident last Sunday when police blocked Fang Lizhi, China's leading dissident, 
from attending the farewell dinner given by Bush after his first trip as 
President to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the banquet, without consulting the Chinese side, the U.S. side sent an 
invitation, bypassing the normal channel, to a certain individual unacceptable 
to the Chinese side," the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement to 
reporters. "This act of imposing one's own will on others can only be 
interpreted as support for this kind of people and disrespect for the host 
country," the statement said.

Norwegians may soon see one of their most famous cultural landmarks, Oslo's 
Grand Hotel, fall into Swedish hands. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel's cafe, where 19th-Century playwright Henrik Ibsen drank a daily cup 
of coffee at a table by the window, is a great source of national pride. 
Artists, including painter Edvard Munch, also met there. 
</P>
<P>
Stockholm-Saltsjoebaden, a Swedish investment firm, said today it has entered 
discussions with the Grand's management on a possible takeover. Any Swedish 
takeover is not likely to be popular in Oslo. Norway was ruled by Sweden for 
almost 100 years, until 1905, and Norwegians are still sensitive to what many 
see as a Swedish superiority complex.

Telemedia Inc., Canada's largest publisher of consumer magazines, said today it 
has reached a tentative agreement to buy New England Monthly, a 5-year-old 
regional magazine that has been struggling toward profitability. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the sale were not disclosed pending ratification of the agreement by 
the magazine's 59 shareholders. Both Robert Nylen, 44, the magazine's 
publisher, and Editor Daniel Okrent, 40, will continue in their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite winning national awards for journalism and tripling its circulation to 
more than 116,000, New England Monthly's costs continue to exceed its revenues, 
Nylen said. 
</P>
<P>
A literate, breezy, often irreverent publication, New England Monthly 
frequently profiles small companies or craftsmen and devotes one issue a year 
to "local heroes." But it has been harshly critical of some of New England's 
most powerful institutions and individuals.

DELTA TO BEGIN NONSTOP N.Y.-L.A. FLIGHTS

Delta Air Lines Inc. said today it will offer its first coast-to-coast flights 
next year with nonstop service on the crowded New York-to-Los Angeles route. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta-based carrier said the flights could link up with routes across the 
Pacific to Asia. Delta serves Hawaii and is seeking U.S. government approval to 
fly between Los Angeles and Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
American and Northwest airlines have also filed for the Los Angeles-Sydney 
route. A decision by the U.S. government on the carrier to be awarded the route 
will probably be made by the fall, a Delta spokesman said. United and 
Continental airlines currently fly the route. 
</P>
<P>
Delta has 40 long-range MD-11 aircraft on order from McDonnell Douglas Corp., 
which it will start receiving in 1991. It plans to use the wide-body jets for 
flights to the Pacific, the world's fastest-growing airline market. 
</P>
<P>
Initial plans call for three daily round-trip flights on wide-body jetliners 
between Los Angeles International Airport and New York's John F. Kennedy 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Delta already has large operations in Los Angeles following its 1987 purchase 
of Western Airlines, which is based in the city. 
</P>
<P>
In adding New York-Los Angeles routes, Delta is entering one of the most 
price-competitive markets. Fares have been as low as $99 each way for the 
3,000-mile trip in recent years as carriers seek to increase their share of the 
big market. 
</P>
<P>
Carriers flying the route include United, Continental, Trans World Airlines, 
American and Pan Am.

BUDGET COMMISSION ENDS IN DEADLOCK; 
</P>
<P>
BIPARTISAN ADVISORY PANEL ISSUES DIFFERING REPORTS ON SOLUTIONS TO U.S. FISCAL 
CRISIS

<TEXT>
<P>
A high-level advisory group once seen as the best hope for crafting a 
bipartisan solution to the nation's budget problems ended up deadlocked, 
issuing a final report today that splits essentially along party lines. 
</P>
<P>
The seven Republicans on the National Economic Commission and the one Democrat 
appointed by President Bush endorsed the President's pledge against raising 
taxes and praised his budget submission to Congress, calling it a "workable 
plan for eliminating the deficit" by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
However, the six Democrats on the panel who were appointed by the congressional 
leadership signed a minority report calling Bush's budget "neither 
theoretically sound nor politically realistic." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's $1.16-trillion spending plan for 1990 "rules out any 
discussion of additional revenues and relies heavily on harsh and 
disproportionate reductions in domestic spending," the Democrats said. 
</P>
<P>
The sharply divergent reports echo the debate between Bush and congressional 
Democrats, in which both sides remain far apart on solutions to a budget crisis 
that is expected to produce a deficit of $170 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Administration is disappointed that the panel has failed its 
mission to come up with a bipartisan formula for reducing the budget deficit, 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: 
</P>
<P>
"They did an excellent job in trying to carry out their mandate. It was a very 
difficult debate and discussion that they held. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the things in that report are very useful, and we'll have to analyze 
it for a more detailed response," he added. "They did the best they could," 
Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D-Calif.) called the commission's 
report "disappointing" but said it is not surprising. 
</P>
<P>
"With little support or leadership from the President or the Congress, the 
commission was unable to face up to the difficult issues," he said in a written 
statement. "It had no choice but to punt." 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which now goes out of existence, was a deep disappointment to 
supporters, who pushed legislation creating the panel through Congress in the 
wake of the October, 1987, stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
Their hopes were that a panel of the nation's top business, labor and political 
leaders would be able to agree on a combination of spending cuts and tax 
increases to solve a deficit problem that has almost tripled the national debt 
over the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
While campaigning for the White House, however, Bush was openly critical of the 
commission, which had the backing of his Republican primary opponent, Sen. Bob 
Dole (R-Kan.). Bush vowed to reject any final report which called for a tax 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's Democratic co-chairman, Robert Strauss, said that he had 
"hoped for a great deal more" but that the commission's fate was sealed by 
Bush's campaign against tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss and Republican co-chairman Drew Lewis had hoped at one time to adopt an 
ambitious package that would cut $50 billion to $60 billion from the deficit, 
in part by raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss drew criticism from within his own party last fall, however, when he 
suggested that cuts in government benefit programs, including Social Security, 
would be needed to balance the government's books.

The European Community said today the United States' latest move to boost 
subsidies for farm exports suggests Washington is not committed to serious 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The EC-U.S. deadlock over agriculture is the biggest obstacle to success in the 
Uruguay Round of talks to liberalize world trade, which resume at ministerial 
level next month after a stalemate in Montreal in December. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter Tuesday asked Congress to remove 
the ceiling on how much the United States can spend on subsidies under its 
Export Enhancement Program to strengthen Washington's hand in the talks, held 
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
"(Yeutter's remarks) are not helpful to the development of a cordial and 
friendly atmosphere in these negotiations, so essential to the interests of 
U.S. and European Community agriculture," EC Agriculture Commissioner Ray 
MacSharry said today.

Unbeaten Australian light-heavyweight boxer Jeff Harding pounded out a 
unanimous 10-round decision over American Art Jimmerson today to move a step 
closer to a world title fight. 
</P>
<P>
Harding, 23, upped his record to 13-0, including 11 knockouts, by dominating 
Jimmerson throughout the one-sided bout. The Australian scored repeatedly with 
left jabs and right uppercuts, but Jimmerson stayed on his feet throughout the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
Harding, the Orient and Pacific light-heavyweight champion, is ranked second in 
the super-middleweight division by the World Boxing Council and hopes to gain a 
world title shot later this year. American Sugar Ray Leonard holds that title.

Kidnaping charges against Robert Lavette, who set the all-time rushing mark at 
Georgia Tech and played with Atlanta and Dallas in the NFL, were dropped and he 
was freed on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
Lavette, 25, who left Georgia Tech as its all-time leading rusher, receiver and 
scorer, was originally charged with kidnaping, battery and aggravated battery 
in connection with a Jan. 21 fight at an Atlanta hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta police spokesman Keith Williams said Lavette was arrested Monday at the 
auto agency where he works in connection with a fight between Lavette and 
Arlecia Shephard, 24. At a court hearing Tuesday, Municipal Judge Andrew Mickle 
agreed to reduce the charges against Lavette to two misdemeanor counts of 
simple battery after Shephard sought to drop the kidnap charge.

Twenty-nine years after the Lakers moved west, the Land of 10,000 Lakes 
officially is home to a National Basketball Assn. franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Owners Harvey Ratner and Marv Wolfenson said today that they met today's 
deadline for the second installment of their $32.5-million NBA expansion 
franchise fee by wiring $16.25 million to the NBA. The payment enables the 
Minnesota Timberwolves to begin play in the 1989-90 season, assuming that the 
owners have met other NBA criteria. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we officially have the NBA back in Minnesota," Ratner said in a 
statement. "It is a credit to the Timberwolves staff and to area fans. We could 
not have accomplished the league's requirements without the support of state 
and local officials, and particularly, Timberwolves fans." 
</P>
<P>
Ratner and Wolfenson said they also made a $100,000 non-refundable deposit when 
making application for the franchise in 1986; a $3.15-million payment in the 
summer of 1987 and a $13-million installment Dec. 1, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Timberwolves President Bob Stein has said that half the total $32.5-million 
franchise fee came from the pockets of Wolfenson and Ratner and half is bank 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
NBA spokesman Brian McIntyre said this morning that he expects no problems with 
the final payment. 
</P>
<P>
The Timberwolves said they have also met the NBA's requirements that they sell 
at least 10,000 season tickets with at least 50% payment by Dec. 31, 1988, sign 
radio and television contracts, finalize leasing and scheduling agreements in 
their home arena and make adequate progress in the construction of their new 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers played in Minnesota for 12 years before moving to Los Angeles, where 
NBA-great Jerry West and the Los Angeles franchise began their rookie seasons 
in 1961.

GERVIN'S FINANCIAL WOES MOUNT AFTER DRUG INCIDENT

<P>
Former San Antonio Spurs star George (The Iceman) Gervin's financial troubles 
have begun to mount in the wake of a reported incident with drugs that police 
investigated as an apparent overdose, the San Antonio Light reported today. 
</P>
<P>
A police report of the Saturday incident stated that Gervin, taken by ambulance 
to Methodist Hospital, told the investigating officer that he snorted what he 
"thought was cocaine" and later said he did not know what it was that he put up 
his nose. 
</P>
<P>
He also told the officer he did not want to commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 36-year-old Gervin told the San Antonio Express-News that he was 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
"Just let it go," Gervin told the Express-News. "I'm just living my life and 
trying to have a good one. . . . I'm fine. Everything's fine." 
</P>
<P>
But the San Antonio Light reported today that Gervin's troubles are mounting 
because no acceptable arrangements have been made to bring loan payments up to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
Gervin and his wife, Joyce, have a $23,000 loan from Murray Savings of Dallas, 
which holds a mechanic's lien, Real Estate Foreclosures Inc. reported. The 1988 
appraised value of his 3,100-square-foot home is $177,200, according to Bexar 
County tax records. 
</P>
<P>
Murray officials told the Light that it will accept only full payment of the 
remaining amount due on the loan or the property will be sold at the regularly 
monthly foreclosure auction Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
His wife is seeking a second divorce from the former NBA All-Star, the Light 
reported.
