COUNCILMAN ADMITS FILINGS WERE DEFICIENT; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: NATIONAL CITY'S JESS E. VAN DEVENTER, TARGET OF A PRIVATE 
INVESTIGATOR, RELEASES AMENDED DISCLOSURE STATEMENTS. THE ORIGINALS LISTED ONLY 
ABOUT A THIRD OF HIS EXTENSIVE PROPERTY HOLDINGS.

<P>
National City Councilman Jess E. Van Deventer reported only about a third of 
his extensive property holdings and also failed to report 14 sources of income 
in his 1988 economic disclosure statement. 
</P>
<P>
The "glaring omissions" were made public when Van Deventer, a businessman with 
financial interests ranging from construction to rental property, released 
amended disclosure statements he had filed for 1985-88. 
</P>
<P>
He announced the new filings Tuesday night at a City Council meeting, saying 
publicly that "my previously filed statements are deficient in certain 
aspects." Van Deventer and his attorney, George Schultz, blamed the omissions 
on "previous advisers" who took care of the councilman's disclosure statements. 
</P>
<P>
Van Deventer has been the subject of a six-month investigation by an Orange 
County private investigator, who has been hired by a yet-unnamed National City 
businessman to probe the councilman's financial and property interests. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Linda Miller, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, 
said the office has received reports about Van Deventer, but stressed that he 
is not under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Both Van Deventer and Schultz said they are aware of the investigation. 
However, Van Deventer insists that his decision to correct his previous filings 
was not prompted by the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"That did not play a role in what I did, none at all," he said. "A few months 
ago, my lawyer and I started checking out the people that I had hired in the 
past to do my statements. During that checking, numerous things came to light, 
and I was concerned that things were not done properly, and we wanted to 
correct them." 
</P>
<P>
Schultz, who acknowledged that the original 1988 filing contained some "glaring 
omissions," minimized Van Deventer's fault in preparing the statements. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying that he's not responsible. I would say that the people 
preparing them weren't completely accurate, and Jess didn't do a good job of 
reviewing them adequately before he signed them," Schultz said. "But where's 
the damage?" 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Van Deventer listed interests in only four National City properties, 
including three on East 17th Street. Under the state's reporting laws, 
politicians are not required to report their personal residences. The amended 
filing listed eight additional properties that he either owns or has an 
interest in. All of the newly listed properties except one are in National 
City. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's council meeting, Van Deventer acknowledged that some of the 
properties are in the city's redevelopment area. To avoid a conflict of 
interest, he said, he has decided not to participate in votes involving future 
redevelopment projects "until this matter is sorted out by my attorney." 
</P>
<P>
"Of primary concern at the present time is the status of certain property 
interests which I have acquired" in the redevelopment area, he told the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Van Deventer said that he, or the properties he owns, did not 
benefit from his previous votes on redevelopment projects. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never a conflict of interests. . . . As far as the taxpayers are 
concerned, I never voted improperly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Van Deventer listed income from only four sources. The amended 
statement lists 14 additional sources of income, ranging from rents collected 
from commercial property he owns to interest from loans made to individuals and 
businesses. Ten of the new incomes were listed at more than $10,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
The new 1988 statement also lists four previously unreported loans received by 
Van Deventer. Three of them were for more than $10,000, and one was paid off in 
1988. Van Deventer posted several of his commercial properties as security for 
the loans; individual properties were used as security for up to three loans 
from different lenders. 
</P>
<P>
Van Deventer also failed to list income from four rental properties in the 
original statement. Each property generates more than $10,000 in income a year. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Van Deventer listed only two investments -- Vancon Corp. and Vancon 
Trust. The corporation is listed as a construction company, while the trust is 
listed as a property management and financing business. The construction 
company is listed as being worth more than $100,000 on both the original and 
amended forms, but the trust company's value is listed at more than $100,000 in 
the new form and between $10,000 and $100,000 in the old one. 
</P>
<P>
The amended form also includes four additional investments, including an 
individual retirement account, ranging in value from $1,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Schultz blamed Pacific Professionals, a San Diego accounting firm that 
represented Van Deventer, for causing confusion in the disclosure statements. 
In previous statements, some of the properties were listed as owned by Pacific 
Professionals, with Van Deventer holding deeds of trust on the properties, 
Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
"The holdings were listed under deeds of trust, when in fact he was the owner. 
There was no deliberate attempt to mislead anybody. . . . We were very 
concerned to get these properties back in Jess' name. That was our primary 
concern," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Accountant Jerry Sagawa, who owns Pacific Professionals, could not be reached 
for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
According to tax records, several of the properties owned in National City by 
Van Deventer and his wife, Sharon, have Pacific Professional's mailing address 
on 5th Avenue in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz said Van Deventer recently obtained title to the properties previously 
held by Pacific Professionals. 
</P>
<P>
He said Van Deventer volunteered on his own to amend his previous statements, 
once he recognized that there were "serious deficiencies in the old filings." 
</P>
<P>
National City Atty. George Eiser and the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission were notified that the corrected statements would be filed, Schultz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This wasn't a situation where someone came in and told us, 'Amend the 
statements or else,' " he said.

DISTRICT TUTOR IN CARLSBAD ACCUSED OF SELLING DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 37-year-old La Costa woman who has worked as a home tutor for the Carlsbad 
Unified School District for the past 12 years will be arraigned today on felony 
charges of conspiring to sell marijuana to an undercover police officer posing 
as a pupil. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad police allege that Jan Dunning agreed to sell marijuana to the 
officer, who posed as a youth who wanted to pass a high school equivalency 
test. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Matt Matnay said Dunning is also suspected of supplying teen-agers with 
drugs and allowing them to use drugs at her La Costa home. 
</P>
<P>
Dunning operates the North County Tutoring Agency out of her home. The agency 
supplies tutors for homebound students throughout San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the undercover agent told Dunning that he was a drug 
dealer and needed to buy some marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation into Dunning's alleged drug activities began about two months 
ago after an outraged parent called Carlsbad police and reported anonymously 
that Dunning was allowing youths to use drugs in her home. Two students also 
reported similar activity to police, and the mother of a student being tutored 
by a youth living with Dunning told police that her son had been offered drugs 
by the 18-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Manning, the county deputy district attorney prosecuting Dunning, said the 
investigation is continuing. Four arrests have been made, and more are 
expected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dunning is charged in connection with the sale of 2 pounds of marijuana to the 
undercover officer. According to police: 
</P>
<P>
In an initial attempt to make the buy Feb. 8, the officer arranged to meet 
Dunning in a supermarket parking lot, but she told the officer that she could 
not come because she could not get a baby-sitter for her children, ages 10 and 
13. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, another meeting was set up in which two men attempted to sell the 
marijuana to the undercover officer. Both men, Roger Ratja, 23, and Wilbert 
Martinez, 24, were arrested and are awaiting arraignment on drug trafficking 
charges, Manning said. A third man, Lawrence Goddard, 38, was arrested after 
the pair identified him as the supplier of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Manning said Dunning and her house guest, 18-year-old Mike Spaulding, were 
identified by Ratja and Martinez as the people who set up the drug deal. 
</P>
<P>
Dunning was arrested Feb. 17 after a search of her house uncovered a scale with 
traces of marijuana on it and a plastic bag with marijuana residue, hidden in a 
sewing basket in a closet, Manning said. Mike Spaulding is sought on a $100,000 
arrest warrant, he said.

POPE CUTS TIJUANA FROM MEXICO ITINERARY; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: THE 11-CITY TOUR IS SEEN AS A MOVE TO IMPROVE STRAINED RELATIONS 
BETWEEN MEXICO AND THE CHURCH, AND IT IS HOPED THAT THE PRELATE WILL ADDRESS 
THE MIGRATION ISSUE.

<P>
Vatican officials have scaled down Pope John Paul II's scheduled trip to Mexico 
in May, canceling a number of planned stopovers, including a visit to Tijuana 
that many hoped would dramatize the plight of refugees and migrants. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have viewed the trip as accelerating a trend toward improvement in the 
long-strained relations between the Catholic Church and the government in 
Mexico, where constitutional provisions severely limit the church's role in 
national affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The final itinerary of the May 6-13 visit, according to a spokesman for 
Archbishop Girolamo Prigione, the Vatican's delegate to Mexico, includes events 
in 11 cities, including a meeting with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in 
Mexico City, a visit to a penitentiary in the north-central state capital of 
Durango and a liturgical celebration in a poor neighborhood of the southern 
city of Tuxtla Gutierrez. Also on the agenda are Aguascalientes, Veracruz, San 
Juan de los Lagos, Chihuahua, Monterrey, Villahermosa, Zacatecas and Chalco, 
site of a well-known shrine near Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, church authorities released a preliminary itinerary that included 
Tijuana, Merida in the Yucatan and Acapulco on the Pacific Coast. But those 
were among a number of visits canceled to streamline the Pope's schedule, a 
church official said. 
</P>
<P>
"Tijuana was just too far," said the spokesman for the apostolic delegate in 
Mexico City. "The problem is that Mexico is so big, and the Pope is already 
spending so much of his time traveling." 
</P>
<P>
Also cut were the central city of Puebla and the western city of Guadalajara, 
both of which were visited by the Pope on his last trip to Mexico, in January, 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials in Tijuana and other areas that were sliced from the agenda 
have expressed disappointment, but say they realize that the Pope cannot go 
everywhere in the nation of more than 80 million people, most of whom are Roman 
Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
The specific themes to be addressed by the Pope during his visit remain 
unknown, although church officials have said he is expected to speak on topics 
ranging from Third World poverty, to drug trafficking, to foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
In Tijuana, which has become one of the world's great migratory corridors, word 
of the Pope's possible visit prompted expectation that he would discuss 
migration, particularly the flight of Latin American economic and political 
refugees to the United States. Tijuana is an intermediary destination for 
hundreds of thousands of migrants each year; it also attracts tens of thousands 
of settlers annually from elsewhere in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Pope will not visit Tijuana, it is still hoped that he will 
address the issue, so evident in Mexico and Central America, of people 
displaced for economic and political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the Pope will speak about migration," said Sergio Bernardo Melendez, 
administrator of Centro Scalabrini, a church-run shelter in Tijuana that 
provides housing and other assistance to the city's huge migratory population. 
"It would have been very interesting if he had come here, but I think whatever 
he says can help." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Melendez expressed hope that the Pope's comments may prompt 
Mexican authorities to crack down on police and immigration officials who 
extort bribes from Central American migrants. "Maybe the Pope could help to 
reduce the exploitation of these people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The hardships that propel immigration and the resulting rigors are not new 
themes for the pontiff. In January, he discussed the issue on a visit to Cape 
Verde, an impoverished archipelago nation off the West African coast that has a 
history of migration. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever topics are addressed by the Pope in Mexico, his visit and meeting with 
Salinas are viewed as extremely significant in improving church-state 
relations. Mexican officials, their views shaped by revolutionary reforms 
dating from the 19th Century, have long been suspicious of the Catholic Church, 
an institution historically allied with conservative Latin American elites. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas has indicated his desire to reach out to the church; he even invited 
members of the Catholic hierarchy to attend his inauguration in 1988. That and 
other developments have prompted hopes that the visit could result in reforms 
removing some of the more stringent legal limitations on the church in Mexico.

COUNTY PANEL OKS UNDERGROUND METRO RAIL LINK; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: THE ROUTE TO LINK UP WITH METRO RAIL WOULD RUN ALONG THE SOUTHERN 
PACIFIC RIGHT-OF-WAY. SEVERAL ABOVE-GROUND OPTIONS WERE REJECTED. 
</P>

<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission on Wednesday ended nearly four 
years of often bitter debate over a proposed San Fernando Valley rail line that 
would connect to Metro Rail from downtown by selecting a route that is 
underground in residential areas of North Hollywood and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's 8-3 vote for a route along the Southern Pacific railroad right 
of way, crossing the Valley from the Metro Rail terminus in North Hollywood to 
Warner Center, doesn't ensure that the line will be built. Two other areas of 
the county are competing for funds available for the next rail project. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is scheduled on March 28 to choose which of the three will get 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's vote pleased the coalition of political, civic, business and 
homeowner leaders who have been pushing for a 5.6-mile westward extension of 
the downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro Rail subway to the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
They opposed rival proposals for a surface rail line along the same route, and 
a monorail along the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy. We got what we wanted," said state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), 
who led efforts to form the coalition from previously antagonistic groups. 
Robbins, though not a commission member, lobbied on behalf of the subway plan 
right up to the vote. 
</P>
<P>
A second vote on Valley rail options was much closer. 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 5 to 6, commissioners decided against authorizing further study of 
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich's plan to build an elevated monorail or 
magnetic levitation system on the south shoulder of the Ventura Freeway from 
Universal City to Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
Although clearly reluctant to offend Antonovich, who also has lobbied intensely 
in recent days for his plan, the commission majority indicated it felt that the 
90 days of additional study required for the monorail plan would take the 
Valley out of contention for the next rail project. 
</P>
<P>
The two other rail projects under consideration are a light-rail line from 
downtown to Pasadena and a northward extension of the Century Freeway 
light-rail line, from El Segundo to Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
The commission says it has only enough money to build one more line before the 
turn of the century because most of its rail money is committed to three lines 
already under construction: Metro Rail and two light-rail lines, the Century 
Freeway and Long Beach-Los Angeles routes. 
</P>
<P>
Several commissioners have acknowledged privately that the Valley has the 
political clout to take the funding for the next line, provided that the 
consensus on the Metro Rail extension remains firm. 
</P>
<P>
In a demonstration of that clout, the Los Angeles City Council earlier 
Wednesday voted 11 to 0 to endorse the Valley Metro Rail extension plan. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county transportation commissioners committed themselves to 
building any Valley rail line underground along the Southern Pacific freight 
line, which roughly parallels Chandler and Victory boulevards, they left open 
the possibility of using light rail or even monorail or magnetic levitation 
technology on the line. 
</P>
<P>
However, staff members speculated that the technology question was left open 
only as an effort to mollify Antonovich, who did not attend the meeting but has 
left no doubt that he strongly advocates a futuristic elevated line. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Metro Rail extension drew widespread support, about 60 people 
indicated they opposed the plan at Wednesday's two-hour public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people turned out in 1987 to fight a ground-level light-rail line 
along the Chandler-Victory route, which traverses a four-mile stretch of quiet 
single-family neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those who spoke out against the new line Wednesday live along the 
railroad right of way, which carries only one freight train a week. 
</P>
<P>
They said they view the subway proposal as a conspiracy to neutralize what had 
been well-organized opposition. Once the route is designated, "the trains will 
magically levitate and we will have our worst fear, a surface system," said 
attorney Robert Silver. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Marvin Sugarman, speaking for six Orthodox Jewish synagogues and 
community centers clustered along Chandler Boulevard in North Hollywood, 
opposed the Metro Rail extension, but indicated that opposition might be 
dropped if the commission supports legislation in Sacramento that would make 
construction of a subway through North Hollywood and Van Nuys mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
A bill sponsored by Robbins that would require a subway in those areas was 
fought by the commission and vetoed last year by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"Without protective legislation," said Sugarman, "we will be at the whim and 
mercy of the LACTC." 
</P>
<P>
A 5.6-mile Metro Rail extension to the San Diego Freeway -- as proposed by 
Robbins and the other Valley leaders -- would include nearly four miles of 
tunnel, cost $1.1 billion and draw 41,000 daily passengers, according to a 
commission study. 
</P>
<P>
To meet the requirements of state environmental law, commissioners designated 
as the Valley route the full right of way from North Hollywood to Warner 
Center. However, they made it clear there would be only enough money to build 
the line as far as the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich's proposed elevated rail system would be 16.5 miles long and cost 
$1.8 billion. Its ridership is estimated at 48,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
For nearly four years, there has been debate over what kind of mass transit 
line to build in the San Fernando Valley and where it should be located. 
Business leaders and most homeowner activists agreed that an east-west line is 
needed to keep the Valley from being bogged down in congestion as the Ventura 
Freeway and other cross-Valley arteries stagger under increasing traffic. But 
homeowner leaders have insisted that no rail line should be allowed to disturb 
the Valley's many single-family neighborhoods. They argued for a subway, which 
business leaders initially said would be too expensive. Recently, the two sides 
came together on a modified subway plan. In November, the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission released a study of 10 alternatives for mass transit 
in the Valley.

SANTA CLARITA SCHOOLS DEFER BOND MEASURE AFTER SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Clarita Valley high school trustees, discouraged by a poll that showed 
voters would support only a limited tax increase to build schools, have decided 
to wait at least a year before asking the public to pass a bond measure for 
badly needed new schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It did not seem to me that it would be in our best interest to look at a bond 
issue right now," Clyde Smyth, superintendent of the William S. Hart Union High 
School District, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, the Hart trustees agreed with Smyth that the district should 
launch a campaign to educate the public about the district's needs and the 
possible fund-raising methods to pay for land and new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
That Hart proposal will be discussed by the Santa Clarita Valley Trustees 
Assn., composed of trustees from the Hart district, the valley's four 
elementary school districts and one community college district. 
</P>
<P>
The poll, released last Friday, surveyed 600 randomly selected voters in the 
Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
It found that $50 to $60 was the maximum amount of additional property tax that 
two-thirds of the voters would be willing to pay each year to build schools. 
Bond measures need the approval of two-thirds of the voters to pass. 
</P>
<P>
But Santa Clarita Valley school officials estimated that it would cost property 
owners $300 a year to finance $400 million in bonds the six districts would 
need to build schools over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing, but I'm not surprised," Smyth said of the poll results. 
Tax measures always encounter opposition, and in Santa Clarita many residents 
believe that developers should pay more to build schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In November a proposed bond measure to raise $275 million for new roads in the 
Santa Clarita Valley failed miserably, winning only 4,000 of 19,714 votes cast. 
The bond measure would have increased annual property tax bills between $75 and 
$200.

David Winseman has fought on behalf of a teachers union, fought to protect the 
environment and now he's fighting again -- battling the Los Angeles Department 
of Water and Power to keep his garden plots. 
</P>
<P>
Under a 1975 agreement with the city, Winseman, 58, and about 50 members of the 
Arleta Garden Club grow vegetables and fruit on two acres of land beneath the 
DWP's power lines along Canterbury Avenue between Wentworth and Chase streets. 
They're obligated to keep the land free of trash and weeds and are allowed to 
use the land without charge. 
</P>
<P>
But now the feisty group of gardeners, who see the farming as a way of 
socializing as well as a way to grow food, are kicking up dirt over what they 
say is a DWP attempt to shove them off the land. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP wants the gardeners, most of whom are elderly, to pick up trash and cut 
grass and weeds along a 5-foot-wide parkway, which is a strip of property 
between the fenced gardens and the street. But gardeners worry about being 
required to toil long hours to uproot the parkway's 3-foot-high weeds, which 
they say they don't have the equipment to handle. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP also wants to prohibit planting within 50 feet of transmission towers, 
instead of the current 25-foot corridor, to accommodate maintenance workers. 
The gardening club says that would cause some of their members to lose their 
plots. 
</P>
<P>
DWP spokeswoman Mindy Berman called the community garden a good program but 
said the department is re-evaluating the club's license because of increasing 
maintenance costs and complaints about trash in the parkway. She said the DWP 
wants the garden club to maintain the parkway, as commercial lessees do. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the DWP's 1,500 miles of right of way in Los Angeles and San Bernardino 
counties is leased for commercial agricultural purposes, storage, parking and 
trucking operations. The Arleta community garden is one of four under DWP's 
lines in the two counties. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has club President Phil Lopez thinking of hanging up his spade and 
drinking beer in front of the television. Lopez, 73, sometimes rises with the 
sun to till, plant and weed for his health. 
</P>
<P>
"Half of us gardeners are going to pull out" over the controversy, he said. 
"I've got high blood pressure. That's why I spend so much time here. I can't 
get out there and really work my butt off. The weeds get up knee high and a 
lawn mower can't take care of that. I'm not going to take care of city property 
-- no way. I'll go home and dry up." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Chu, 74, who has grown vegetables under the power lines for a decade, 
threatened to go to court. He is among those who would lose their garden plots 
under the proposed DWP rule changes. "When it comes to the right thing, I'm no 
chicken," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A DWP official plans to meet with the garden club March 10 to discuss the 
dispute. The department has pledged to maintain the parkway until next year and 
has offered replacement land for lost plots. 
</P>
<P>
Winseman is hoping that people with green thumbs can continue to grow beets, 
cabbages, onions, boysenberries and pineapples, giving the excess away to 
friends, family and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"We save considerably by putting fresh and good vegetables on the table, 
vegetables that are not sprayed with insecticides and lots of chemicals," 
Winseman said proudly. "We're doing something for our community. Our vegetables 
are good, better than you can get in the markets."

DAUGHTERS, 4 AND 7, GONE WHEN MOTHER RETURNS HOME 
</P>

A La Mesa woman reported her two young daughters missing after she returned 
home early Wednesday morning from picking up her car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The girls, ages 4 and 7, were last seen sleeping in their bedroom by their 
mother, Ester Silva, and a friend who left for Hillcrest to pick up Silva's 
car, which was being repaired, police Lt. Allan Joslyn said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that 7-year-old Olivia Silva is about 4 feet, 4 inches tall, weighs 60 
pounds and has brown eyes and long brown hair. She has large dimples and is 
missing her front teeth. She was wearing a floor-length pink gown with white 
sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
Her sister, 4-year-old Carolyn Silva, is about 3 feet, 4 inches tall, weighs 40 
to 50 pounds and has brown hair and brown eyes, Joslyn said. She was last seen 
wearing a floor-length pink gown with a cartoon character on it. 
</P>
<P>
Silva, 34, and the woman friend gave conflicting accounts of the time they left 
the residence on Lake Murray Boulevard, said La Mesa Police Capt. Wayne Beatty. 
</P>
<P>
Silva told police they left the condominium at 4:30 a.m. to pick up the car 
from the home of a friend who was repairing it, and returned at 5:30 a.m., 
Beatty said. But the friend told investigators they left at 2:30 a.m. and 
returned at 5:30 a.m, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Silva told authorities that, when they returned, the doors were still locked 
and there were no signs of forced entry, Beatty said. He said Silva told police 
that the friend is the only other person who has keys to the home. 
</P>
<P>
Silva called several friends asking if they knew where the girls were, Beatty 
said. At 8 a.m., someone called police, who took Silva and the woman in for 
questioning about 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview at the residence, Silva's friend, who declined to give her 
name, said they left at 2:30 a.m. and returned at 3 a.m. She did not say why 
the two left the girls alone or why they had chosen that time to pick up the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
She said that whoever took the girls is probably someone who was owed money by 
Silva's husband, Anthony, who was killed in July. 
</P>
<P>
According to Beatty, Anthony Silva, 33, was shot and killed in Clairemont in 
the garage of his home on Mt. Herbert Avenue on July 26 in a dispute over a 
drug deal, according to a coroner's report. 
</P>
<P>
Ester Silva declined to talk to a reporter.

TORRANCE SEEKS STATE SAFETY STUDY OF TRAINS WITH HAZARDOUS CARGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Alarmed by the shipment of hydrofluoric acid over railroad tracks through 
Torrance, City Council members Tuesday asked state officials to study whether 
the practice is safe. 
</P>
<P>
The council's unanimous resolution asks the California Public Utilities 
Commission to conduct a safety evaluation of the railroad's movement of 
hazardous materials, a standard procedure that involves studying the condition 
of the tracks, the rail cars and locomotives used and the safety practices 
employed. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Kenneth Nelson said he decided to recommend turning to the 
commission for help because his initial legal research indicates that federal 
and state commerce laws prevent Torrance from exercising any control over the 
railroads. 
</P>
<P>
"Any supplementary city ordinances would probably run afoul of the federal 
constitutional limitations on local agencies' imposing undue burdens on 
interstate commerce," Nelson said in a written report to the council. 
</P>
<P>
Asking for a state review of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroad lines 
in the city may be the city's only recourse, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In our opinion, this would be a significant, practical and cost-free (to the 
city) way of minimizing such hazard," Nelson said in his report. 
</P>
<P>
The city's concerns center on railroad cars bound for Allied-Signal's El 
Segundo plant. Twice a week, a car loaded with nearly 22,000 gallons of 
hydrofluoric acid leaves an Allied-Signal manufacturing plant in Louisiana. In 
the South Bay, the route follows an Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Railway line 
through Torrance, Lawndale, portions of Redondo Beach and Hawthorne and into 
the company's El Segundo facility. 
</P>
<P>
The council learned how Allied-Signal transports its hydrofluoric acid in a 
brief memo in January from Torrance Fire Chief Scott Adams. He said he became 
curious about how the company receives the chemical after seeing statistics 
showing that it consumes 4,320 gallons each day -- more than nine times the 
consumption rate at Mobil Oil's Torrance refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil's use of the substance has been under attack in the city. Next Tuesday, 
Torrance residents will be asked to vote on whether bulk storage of 
hydrofluoric acid should be banned. 
</P>
<P>
Although a PUC evaluation of the railroad's movement of hazardous materials 
probably would not lead to an outright ban of the practice, Nelson and Adams 
said they think it could ensure that it is done as safely as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have railroad cars falling off the tracks every day, so we're not 
saying anything is unsafe right now," Adams said. "But it's a very good idea to 
take a close look at it."

NEW PRINCIPAL HAS 'GOOD VIBES' ABOUT MORNINGSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mallory L. Matthews, an assistant principal at Inglewood High School, has been 
named to replace Morningside High School Principal Art Murray, who was forced 
out of his job earlier this month by district administrators who held him 
responsible for the troubled first semester at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews was described by district officials as an experienced administrator 
with firm goals for transforming Morningside. He was Morningside's assistant 
principal from 1981-85 before going to Inglewood High. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a listener," district spokesman Maurice Wiley said. "He seems to display 
a genuine concern for improvement of the district. His strengths are in 
community activities and parent involvement." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside ranks in the bottom 5% in statewide achievement tests and was the 
subject of student protests last month over poor instruction, campus conditions 
and safety. Matthews gave district officials a two-page strategy for improving 
the school that covers maintenance, community relations, school morale and 
accountability of school personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as bad as I expected it to be" based on newspaper accounts and talk 
among residents and staff, Matthews said Wednesday morning as he began his 
second day on the job. "I got good vibes after the first day. I look forward to 
the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews' improvement strategy called for daily removal of graffiti, a monthly 
newsletter for parents, programs to involve more parents in the school and 
periodic monitoring by administrators of all teachers. Other plans include an 
award program to honor superior students, a detention program for students who 
are late or truant, and meetings with the press to publicize the school. 
</P>
<P>
"He came in with an organized plan and he has a tremendous amount of 
experience," board member Zyra McCloud said. "He's really paid his dues." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews, who lives near the Morningside campus, received a master's degree in 
education from Pepperdine University. In addition to his two assistant 
principal posts, Matthews has served as Inglewood's coordinator of adult 
education and as a summer school principal. He entered the district in 1980 as 
an adult education instructor. He will be paid $55,440. 
</P>
<P>
McCloud said she conducted an informal survey of 30 of Morningside's 40 
teachers, who preferred that Murray be retained, although they rated Matthews 
as their choice to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, who came to Inglewood Unified School District last fall from a school 
outside Bakersfield, was transferred last week to a special administrative post 
created for him in district headquarters after only six months as Morningside 
principal. He will be paid $62,016 in his new post, the same salary he received 
as principal. 
</P>
<P>
Murray reported to work Friday at his new job but has called in sick so far 
this week. In a brief telephone interview Wednesday, he said he was dealt with 
unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter who they send in there," he said from his home in Delano. 
"If they don't provide the support and assistance, things won't fly. If they 
don't provide the funds to clean up the campus, you're going to have the same 
kinds of problems."

PRINCIPAL POINTS TO STRIDES AT GOMPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gompers Secondary School Principal Marie Thornton on Wednesday asked parents 
and students not to let a student demonstration in support of a teacher last 
Friday overshadow what she said are continuing academic gains at the 
long-troubled Southeast San Diego school. 
</P>
<P>
During an afternoon press conference, Thornton also said her action in 
transferring business education teacher Rhoenna Armster involuntarily to 
Lincoln High School was not in retribution for Armster's outspoken opposition 
to changes in curriculum at the math-science-computer magnet school. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton and top San Diego Unified School District administrators say that 
state law, and the threat of legal action by Armster, prohibit discussion of 
specific reasons for the transfer. Armster has also declined comment on 
specifics, although she has said that Thornton acted out of retribution. School 
Supt. Tom Payzant said Tuesday night that he and school board members back the 
transfer. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration by students provoked a police response of more than 30 units, 
including trained dogs, a police helicopter and riot-equipped police, which 
Payzant and trustees believe may have fanned the planned demonstration into a 
larger news story than it otherwise would have been. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton, who remained in her office dealing with telephone calls and other 
matters during the demonstration, declined comment on the police action, saying 
that she would await results of separate district and Police Department 
investigations into why so many officers were dispatched to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
But the school's African-American male pupil advocate, teacher Douglas 
Williams, said he believes the "media circus" on Friday would not have occurred 
if police had not responded in such force. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton has been criticized by some parents and administrators for not being 
publicly visible during the demonstration. But Thornton rejected those charges, 
saying that she "could not be everywhere" and that a sufficient number of 
administrators handled the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton said she has been an effective leader at Gompers, pointing to 
improvements in the school's physical appearance and student achievement under 
a year-old program to extend the high-powered curriculum to all of the 
overwhelmingly nonwhite neighborhood students who attend the seventh- through 
12th-grade school.

BIOLOGIST REJECTS PRESIDENCY OF SALK INSTITUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Salk Institute has failed to persuade Dr. James E. Darnell, a prominent 
East Coast biologist, to become the research institution's next president. 
However, Renato Dulbecco, who became president in late 1988, has agreed to 
remain in the post until it is filled. 
</P>
<P>
The Salk board of directors learned Monday that Darnell, who was strongly 
endorsed by the institute's faculty, had opted to remain at Rockefeller 
University in New York. The Salk board offered the presidency to Darnell in 
November, after a nationwide search. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the institute's faculty will caucus to determine if another 
candidate should be nominated for the board's consideration, Dulbecco said. 
</P>
<P>
Dulbecco, a Nobel Prize-winning researcher, agreed to leave the laboratory and 
become president in 1988, after Frederic de Hoffman, the longtime Salk 
president, retired. Dulbecco intended to serve only a short time, then return 
to research.

PAIR TO STAND TRIAL IN WOMAN'S FALL FROM BIG SUR CLIFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Virginia Agnes Rearden and her ex-husband Billie Joe (Mark) McGinnis were bound 
over for trial Wednesday in the death of a woman who fell from a Big Sur cliff 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The pair are accused of murdering Deanna Hubbard Wild, 20, to collect on a 
$35,000 life insurance policy that Rearden took out on Wild on April 1, 1987, 
the day before she died. 
</P>
<P>
McGinnis, 50, and Rearden, 53, were married at the time of Wild's death but 
have since divorced. 
</P>
<P>
Ending three days of testimony in the preliminary hearing, Municipal Judge 
Nicholas Kasimatis said that certain acts allegedly committed by the defendants 
"do more than raise the court's suspicions concerning the defendants' 
complicity in (this) very terrible, premeditated murder." 
</P>
<P>
McGinnis and Rearden are charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder. 
The pair, who are being held in lieu of $500,000 bail each, will be bound over 
to Superior Court for trial March 14. They were arrested in September in 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The case against the couple is based on circumstantial evidence: 
</P>
<P>
* The insurance policy named Rearden's son, James Coates, the beneficiary and 
Rearden as the secondary beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
* At the time of Wild's death, the couple were asked by a Monterey County 
deputy coroner whether they knew about any life insurance Wild may have had. 
They said they did not know of any. But, after Wild's death, Rearden filed a 
claim with State Farm Insurance, and affidavits indicate she had paid for the 
policy the day before Wild's death.

BUT AFTER GORBACHEV, WHAT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union is moving rapidly toward a historic transfer of power from the 
Communist Party to a strong executive -- too rapidly in the view of some 
understandably worried reformers. 
</P>
<P>
A draft bill for a presidency invested with sweeping administrative powers has 
won overwhelming legislative approval in the Supreme Soviet, but not before 
many of that body's more progressive members expressed anguished concern over 
the extent of the authority about to be granted to one person. These 
apprehensions would be understandable in any country struggling to nurture 
democratic development. They are particularly acute in a land where autocracy 
unfettered by humane self-restraint has been the traditional method of 
governance. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious paradox is that even as the Communist Party is being stripped of 
its once all-powerful role in Soviet life, the legislature is preparing to 
approve near-dictatorial powers for the country's chief executive. It helps, of 
course, that Mikhail S. Gorbachev is certain to be that president, initially 
chosen by the legislature for four years and then likely to run nationwide for 
a five-year term. Most reformers seem prepared to trust Gorbachev not to abuse 
his new powers. What's troubling many of them is what happens after Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the powers proposed for the presidency have their counterparts in one 
or another of the democracies, including the power to declare a state of 
emergency and impose martial law; to dissolve the legislature and call new 
elections; to control the military and the secret police. Most notable, at a 
time when the Soviet Union confronts growing ethnic unrest and separatist 
groups, is the power to act if civic order breaks down. Armed intervention to 
secure public safety, as in Azerbaijan recently, isn't always a popular step, 
either with those sent to intervene or those who are intervened upon. But in 
the face of threatened anarchy, and especially in a country that has to worry 
about the security of all the nuclear weapons depots and nuclear power plants 
dotted across its vast landscape, it could be an unavoidable step. 
</P>
<P>
What's most clearly missing in the emerging governmental order is an effective 
system of checks and balances aimed at ensuring that executive authority will 
be used responsibly. Perhaps it's too much -- at this embryonic stage of Soviet 
political development -- to expect that provisions would be made for 
legislative and judicial checks on presidential power. But if such restraints 
aren't provided now, when, if ever, will they be? The reformers who have been 
raising that vexing question have good reasons to worry.

GORBACHEV'S LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your editorial "One Who Made a Revolution" (Feb. 8) you correctly praise 
Gorbachev for "honestly defin(ing) the -- conditions facing his country; 
begin(ning) the slow and painful effort to the unshackle the regime from the 
corpse of failed policies and irrelevant ideologies, not least those of the 
Cold War." 
</P>
<P>
I can't help but wonder how long it will take the U.S. to acquire the same 
quality of leadership, foresight and willingness to accommodate to a changing 
world with challenges of environmental degradation, overpopulation, energy 
resource depletion and poverty.

<P>
A San Diego man has died of injuries he received in a hit-and-run accident that 
killed another man, Chula Vista police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Maher, 31, died Sunday of multiple injuries, a coroner's deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
Maher and 23-year-old Raymond Jarvey were playing pool in Smitty's Tavern at 
119 Broadway when a fight broke out shortly after 1:45 a.m. Saturday, police 
Sgt. Richard Coulson said. The bartender told the two men to leave and they 
continued the fight outside, armed with pool cues. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses saw the men lying in the street fighting when a car traveling about 
35 m.p.h. ran over them, Coulson said.

ANTONOVICH ON AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supervisor Michael Antonovich is at it again. In his letter (Feb. 19) he 
described the providing of bleach and clean needles to intravenous drug users 
as "preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
This shows he still refuses to understand or accept the concept of AIDS 
prevention. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of spending money for prevention, he points with apparent pride to the 
fact that Los Angeles will spend over $57 million to combat AIDS this year, 
which he says is double the amount of two years ago. A review of the figures 
from the county explains the doubling of costs. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of January, 1988, there were 4,329 people diagnosed with AIDS in the 
county of whom about 1,600 were still living. At the end of December, 1989, 
there were 8,576 people diagnosed with AIDS of whom about 3,000 were still 
alive. Is it any wonder it is costing the county (and taxpayers) twice as much 
in health care for AIDS as it did two years ago? 
</P>
<P>
But when he writes bout a "responsible approach" to help IV drug users he 
writes about drug rehabilitation programs (which are grossly under-funded) and 
education, but then adds hospices. Hospices are remarkably humane, and cost 
effective. But they are for the dying. 
</P>
<P>
And this is Supervisor Antonovich's (and a majority of the Board of 
Supervisors') true message: Los Angeles will not spend millions of dollars on 
effective programs that slow the spread of the AIDS virus. Instead it will 
spend tens of millions (soon to be hundreds of millions) of dollars on health 
care for people after they become sick and when they are dying. 
</P>
<P>
Is that really how the people of Los Angeles want their limited funds spent?

<TEXT>
<P>
A man convicted of killing another inmate at County Jail in Chula Vista last 
year was sentenced Wednesday to 20 years to life in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Edward Morrison, 39, of Mira Mesa, was given 16 years to life for the 
April 14, 1989, attack upon Luis Jose Mena, 45, who died three weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge David Gill gave Morrison four more years, which 
will run consecutively, for Morrison's four prior convictions for burglary, 
auto theft and escaping from custody. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison's 20-year sentence is to run consecutively to a four-year sentence 
imposed May 26 on the burglary charge for which Morrison was in jail at the 
time of the murder. 
</P>
<P>
A jury found Morrison not guilty of first-degree murder on Jan. 31, but ruled 
he was guilty of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Evan Miller argued that Morrison killed Mena with a large 
push broom because he hated child molesters. Mena was in custody on a probation 
violation of a child-molestation conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Mena was struck six to 10 times, said inmates who testified at the trial, and 
he suffered a fractured skull and brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
Gill also fined Morrison $400. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said crowding at the jail was not necessarily a factor in the slaying.

GORBACHEV'S LEADERSHIP

<TEXT>
<P>
Where is Verdi now that we really need him? 
</P>
<P>
Watching the angry crowds marching through the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, 
their battle cries demanding the obliteration of the remnants of communism, 
resembles the revolutionary events of 1848 Europe. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the battle hymn for of Garibaldi's marching battalions was the 
stirring chorus from Giuseppe Verdi's "Nabucco" -- "Va, pensiero, sull ali 
dorato," sang the enslaved Hebrews of their homeland. The political aspirations 
if the Hebrews were quickly identified with those of the Italians. 
</P>
<P>
As we witness 70 years of stifling frustrations coming to a close, it seems 
only appropriate that the end to Karl Marx's Utopia be melodic and rousing. 
"Arise workers of the world, throw off your chains of communist slavery. The 
society in which all are equal, only some are more equal than others, lies on 
its operatic deathbed." He has the words, Gorbachev now deserves the background 
music that only the genius of Verdi can provide.

NICARAGUA: DEMOCRATIZATION OF CENTRAL AMERICA IS COMPLETE; ITS SUCCESS DEPENDS 
ON POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INTEGRATION WITHIN THE REGION AND WITH NORTH AMERICA.

and intellectuals. He is best known for his seminal book on Mexico The 
Labyrinth of Solitude.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Nicaraguan election has dealt the all-but-final blow to Marxist-Leninist 
revolution as an alternative in this hemisphere. It initiates the closing 
episode of the tumultuous era that began in 1959 with the Cuban Revolution and 
will conclude with the fall of Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
Thankfully, this part of the world, like Eastern Europe, has finally given up 
Marx for Montesquieu. The Sandinistas, by showing mature acceptance of their 
defeat, have apparently learned to value the checks and balances on power that 
are the fundamental guarantee of Western civilization. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Sandinistas had won the election Sunday, it was already clear to 
them that their primitive attempt to establish a Marxist-Leninist government in 
Nicaragua was doomed. Although the U.S.-backed Contras contributed to the 
pressure on the Sandinistas to accept free elections, they were not the 
decisive factor. The transformation of the Sandinistas was primarily a 
consequence of the momentous changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. It 
had became clear to them that the kind of help they needed to carry out their 
revolution would not be forthcoming from Mikhail Gorbachev or their rapidly 
collapsing Communist allies in Eastern Europe. And without Soviet backing, 
Cuba's support was useless. 
</P>
<P>
As realists, the Sandinistas decided to save what they could of their 
revolution. Although a free election posed the risk of their losing power, they 
thought that at least they could salvage their legitimacy as the major unified 
presence capable of influencing Nicaragua's future. The only other alternative 
was to suffer the same isolation as Cuba. Unless they undergo a significant 
split, the Sandinistas still have a viable future. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of the Nicaraguan election on the enigma of Cuba is unclear. History 
is not only a matter of impersonal social forces but of human beings; of chance 
and accidents. Fidel Castro is a historical accident. Persons are 
unpredictable, and Cuba is a personalized regime. But the election in Nicaragua 
makes Castro's choice strikingly clear: Either he can take the path of Daniel 
Ortega -- who followed the lead of Poland, East Germany and Czechoslovakia -- 
or he can follow the path of Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania. With each passing 
day, Castro seems less disposed to take the path of the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
As it relates to Mexico, the defeat of one-party rule at the Nicaraguan polls 
will certainly be used by the opposition to Mexico's ruling party, the PRI, to 
press for more rapid democratization. Although the pace of democratization 
might be too slow, it has been solidly under way in Mexico for some time. Under 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the PRI realizes, as the Sandinistas did, 
that democratization is a matter of their life or death as a viable party. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, the Sandinista defeat can also be read as something of a defeat 
for the anti-gringo sentiment that has plagued Latin America long past its 
historical reality. After all, the Nicaraguan people elected the candidate 
openly endorsed by the President of the United States, George Bush, who was a 
key supporter of arming the Contras. And, contrary to predictions, the U.S. 
invasion of Panama last December did not unleash a nationalist backlash to 
cement the Sandinista hold on power. The abandonment of anti-gringo sentiment, 
which is evident across Latin America, will be a key factor in confronting the 
problems of a Central America at peace. 
</P>
<P>
The new peace will present President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro with the 
pressing tasks of Nicaragua's reconciliation and reconstruction. These can be 
effected only through broad integration, not only with the rest of Central 
America, the Caribbean and Mexico but with the heretofore customarily vilified 
United States as well. 
</P>
<P>
The division of Central America into six countries is an artificial remnant of 
extreme decolonization. Since these countries don't have historic national 
identity and lack economic and political viability on their own, the only 
solution for them is to unite into a regional common market and political 
association like the European Community. These would be linked in turn with a 
larger integration in a North American community. 
</P>
<P>
If these tiny countries remain alone in the 21st Century, they will remain the 
poor and impotent pawns of outside powers, a situation that has already led to 
so much bloodshed in this century. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the ideological rift has diminished in Central America, the main 
threat to the promise of integration, as in Eastern Europe, will be resurgent 
nationalism. Here, too, democratization is the best guarantee against 
nationalist reaction. In Latin America, anti-U.S. sentiment has resided mainly 
in intellectuals and aristocrats who inherited Spanish tradition. The 
Conservative Party of Mexico, for example, asked the help of Napoleon III to 
defend against the "gringo menace." In this century, the custodians of 
anti-Americanism have been on the left, not the right. Anachronistic 
intellectuals, primarily of the left, are the last to change. 
</P>
<P>
The kind of democratic developments we have just witnessed in Nicaragua, 
however, will make economic integration more appealing than nationalism 
</P>
<P>
Economic integration alone, of course, will not close the gap between rich and 
poor or reconcile freedom and equality. It will only be the condition for such 
a possibility. As in the United States and Europe, the likely order will be a 
mixed economy: a free market with state intervention to alleviate gross 
inequality. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinista defeat, like the defeat of the Marxist left generally, is the 
defeat of fantasy. The communist remedy to social injustice proved worse than 
the malady. Now our challenge is to find the political imagination to address 
those injustices that have outlived their untenable solution.

TORRANCE: SAFETY IS A COMPLEX PROBLEM AT AMERICA'S PETROCHEMICAL PLANTS. THERE 
ARE BETTER WAYS THAN ELECTIONS TO CORRECT THE WRONGS -- BUT ONLY IF INDUSTRY IS 
RESPONSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NAJMEDIN MESHKATI, Najmedin Meshkati is on the faculty of the Institute of 
Safety and Systems Management at USC. He was a 1989 recipient of the 
Presidential Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation for 
his research on the safety of complex, large-scale technological systems.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it." Good advice, sometimes, but an over-reliance 
on it has lately been leading American industry down the garden path of 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibit A is right in our own back yard. On Tuesday, Torrance residents will 
vote on a ballot measure that could force the Mobil Oil Co. to spend up to $100 
million to restructure its refinery operations and eliminate the use of 
hydrofluoric acid, a highly toxic chemical that is used to boost the octane 
level of gasoline. The vote is a response to several mishaps at the refinery in 
the last few years, including one on Nov. 24, 1987, when a buildup of 
hydrofluoric acid resulted in a major explosion, sending a fireball 1,500 feet 
into the air, shaking houses within a 6-mile radius and injuring scores of 
people inside and outside the plant. The cavalier disposition of the refinery 
management toward the accidents and the apparent inaction regarding safety 
improvements, of course, has aggravated the situation and fueled the public's 
anger. 
</P>
<P>
But hydrofluoric acid is not the most serious problem at the refinery, nor does 
the Torrance facility have an exceptionally bad safety record on the national 
scale. In the last two years there have been numerous accidents, fires and 
explosions at several oil and chemical plants in California, Louisiana, New 
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. The climax of this vicious cycle, so 
far, has been what is called America's biggest postwar industrial accident -- 
the explosion last October at the Phillips Petroleum's plastic plant at 
Pasadena, Tex. That explosion, containing the force of 10 tons of TNT, killed 
23 and left more than 100 workers injured. According to insurance-industry 
sources, the accident produced perhaps the largest single U.S. business 
insurance loss in history: about $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The seriousness of these industrial calamities requires thorough investigation 
and dissemination of the lessons learned -- not only for the purpose of 
accident prevention but also for the protection of all our citizens. What makes 
this so urgent is the eerie recurrence of one of the most frequently cited 
causes of accidents at oil and chemical plants -- operator error. According to 
an investigative report carried by the Los Angeles Times in early February, the 
cause of the 1987 blast at the Torrance refinery was attributed to "human 
error." In a 1989 Environmental Protection Agency study of accidental chemical 
releases in the United States, operator error was listed as a primary or 
contributing cause in 31% of cases. Among all causes, this was second only to 
equipment failure, which was responsible for 56% of the accidents. However, not 
always mentioned is that a good majority of these operator "errors" were in 
fact design-induced. 
</P>
<P>
It is now known that both the performance and the inherent accident potential 
of complex, large-scale technological systems are functions of the way their 
parts -- engineered and human -- fit together and interact. On many occasions, 
the error and the resultant system failure is the result of such factors as bad 
work-station and control-room design; complicated operational procedures; 
ineffective (or unfocused) training; non-attentive supervisory systems; rigid 
task and organizational structures; non-responsive feedback mechanisms and 
delayed feedback, and sudden environmental disturbances, such as earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
Due to the large scale and complexity of petrochemical plants, their safety 
itself is a complex and multifaceted problem that requires a scientific, 
systematic and multidisciplinary approach. Conventional safety practices are no 
longer capable of offering effective prognosis. These practices, which are 
primarily based on decoration of plants with antiquated safety signs and 
posters, fruitless disciplinary actions and irrelevant safety drills, resemble 
a tranquilizer that would at best suppress the symptoms of the real causes. 
</P>
<P>
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it," needs to be replaced by the concept of "if 
it ain't broke yet, it may, so let's fix it now." Unfortunately, Tuesday's vote 
in Torrance -- whatever the result -- will not fix anything. An acceptable 
solution can only come from the recognition by the Mobil refinery that it must 
operate with a diligent conscience for environmental and social concerns, and a 
realization by Torrance residents that Mobil's presence benefits the community. 
The problem cannot be solved by legislation or litigation. It can be solved by 
a partnership between Mobil and its Torrance neighbors based on a candid 
exchange of views and information between the partners and on the modern 
scientific approach to safe refinery operations.

VIOLENCE IS ITS OWN WORST ENEMY; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AFRICA: DEFIANT NON-COOPERATION, NOT ARMED STRUGGLE, HAS FUELED THE 
BATTLE AGAINST APARTHEID. THE ANC SHOULD RENOUNCE ITS CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM L. URY, William L. Ury of Harvard University, co-author with Roger 
Fisher of Getting to Yes (Penguin, 1983), is an expert on negotiation and 
conflict resolution. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a military effort, the African National Congress' campaign of armed struggle 
against South Africa's apartheid government has been a disastrous failure. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the violence has raised the costs for the white minority of not 
coming to terms with the ANC and the black majority. It has contributed to the 
perception among whites that things cannot go on as they are. 
</P>
<P>
At the cost of thousands of black lives, however, not one inch of South African 
soil has been gained. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign, launched in the early 1960s, led within months to the 
imprisonment of the leaders of the black nationalist movement -- not for a few 
years but for more than a generation. The movement was decapitated and deprived 
of the guiding talents of such men as Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu. The 
white government seized on incidents of sabotage and violence to impose 
repressive laws that have stymied black protest ever since. The center of 
gravity of white politics moved even further to the right as the violence 
exacerbated the already exaggerated fears of the whites. The violent struggle 
brought new leaders to the fore of the black movement, military commanders far 
less inclined to lay down their arms to negotiate. The country -- both whites 
and blacks -- moved further from the vision of one day living in peace, side by 
side in the same nation. 
</P>
<P>
If not the armed struggle, what then has produced the momentum toward reform? 
Two factors primarily. The first is that the black people of South Africa, for 
economic as well as political reasons, simply refused to comply with the white 
government's vision of separate peoples living separately. Black workers 
streamed into the cities and brought their families with them. They built their 
own squatter towns. They ignored the pass laws, the influx control laws and the 
Group Areas Act. Some prospered and entered a growing black middle class. They 
refused to stay down. Progress was not granted by the whites; it has been taken 
by the blacks. Persistent, defiant non-cooperation has been the dominant method 
of resistance. 
</P>
<P>
The second factor bringing about a change of mind among the white leadership is 
international pressure: financial sanctions, sports boycotts and the like. The 
outrage that produced the sanctions came more than anything else from the 
images of police brutally breaking up peaceful funeral marches and of unarmed 
black youths being whipped by white soldiers. When violence meets nonviolence, 
it is easy to tell who the good guys are. If anything, the armed struggle -- 
with its occasional bombings of restaurants and bars -- confused the moral 
clarity of the campaign against apartheid and defused international pressure. 
</P>
<P>
All this makes one wonder what might have been achieved if the ANC had taken 
the surely heroic step of pursuing a purely nonviolent campaign in the face of 
South African repression. With its leadership talents and the will of the black 
people of South Africa, might a nonviolent ANC have induced the government to 
come to the negotiating table 5, 10, perhaps even 15 years ago? 
</P>
<P>
Certainly this analysis suggests that, at little cost in effectiveness, the ANC 
could now renounce or suspend the armed struggle. And the rewards would be 
great. The unfortunate reality in South Africa is that power is still very much 
in white hands. To get to a truly nonracial democracy, a lot of white minds -- 
and hearts -- still need to be changed. Nothing the ANC could do would be as 
persuasive as ending the armed struggle. Nothing on the ANC's part would 
contribute more to a favorable climate for serious constitutional negotiations. 
Those who argue that it is necessary to keep the pressure on the white 
government are correct, but that pressure will be more effective in the form of 
sustained nonviolent demonstrations and civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
There is a broader lesson here for all those in today's world concerned with 
social change. Where the many are unjustly treated by the powerful few, the 
temptation is to meet violence with violence. Yet, as Gandhi used to like to 
say, "An eye for an eye and we all go blind." The most effective strategy is 
not to challenge the few in the arena of violence where they are strong, but in 
the arena of nonviolent struggle where the many can collectively exert their 
strength. As recent events in South Africa illustrate, in a match between 
violence and nonviolence, nonviolence may ultimately prove the victor.

SOME THINGS AREN'T ON TAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DRUCILLA JAMES MILLS, Drucilla James Mills teaches at Alverno High School in 
Sierra Madre and is co-director of the Oral Culture Research Institute in 
Pasadena.

<TEXT>
<P>
I recently assigned a Charles Dickens novel to my 11th-grade English class. "Is 
this on Beta?" asked one. "Can I get this at Music Plus?" asked another. "I 
don't have time to read this!" wailed a third. 
</P>
<P>
Kids aren't the only ones who don't have time to read. I don't have time for 
The Times; I give the car radio 22 minutes; it gives me the world. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not alone, either. Back in the '50s, evenings were free. Now, Mom and Dad 
come home, microwave dinner, and still have to take care of the kids. Sure, 
they can read. But do they? No -- instead, they turn on cable TV or rent a 
videotape. I'd bet money Beaver Cleaver programs his VCR to tape Oprah while 
he's stuck on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
A teen-age student's harried mother recently came in for a conference with me. 
"Go play your dinosaur book," she told her younger daughter. Will the child 
learn to read from a taped "book" that reads to her? Will she learn how 
wonderful reading is? 
</P>
<P>
I bet she won't. Today's students can watch a movie in class without losing 
interest, but reading is boring. It requires an attention span that many of 
them don't have. It doesn't come with visual effects, and this generation has 
never developed the imagination to make it exciting. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, students can't read because they don't read. Reading is slow 
because they don't know the words in the books. Nintendo is more fun and 
requires less effort. 
</P>
<P>
What can I say, then, to parents who look at me sincerely and ask, "Why aren't 
our kids interested in reading?" Why should they be? They do fine without 
reading. Mom and Dad don't read much, either; they're doing OK. Is it so bad 
that many of today's students will never read as well as their parents? 
</P>
<P>
Why should my teen-age student's little sister learn to read and write? 
</P>
<P>
Because we can't memorize. Could I remember 50 things I need at Von's without 
writing them down? Are you kidding? 
</P>
<P>
Because we don't communicate complicated ideas orally -- we write them down. 
That's why we need technical documentation and contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Because she will be unable to express herself otherwise. When they try to 
explain ideas to me, my students become frustrated, because they don't have the 
vocabulary to make me understand. Kids don't learn much vocabulary from 
workbooks -- they learn it from context by reading or by participating in 
conversation with adults. 
</P>
<P>
Because America cannot compete in the 21st Century unless its current 
schoolchildren have the intellectual ability to lead the way in technology. 
They cannot learn to engineer the future unless they can read. 
</P>
<P>
So where are these parents who don't have time for their kids? Out working like 
crazy to give their kids everything they never had. 
</P>
<P>
Everything?

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PRISON FURLOUGH PLAN CANCELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State corrections officials said Wednesday they will cancel a plan to bring a 
work furlough program for 80 male parolees into a now-closed Inglewood motel 
because of opposition from the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Council members had issued a resolution strongly condemning the move. 
</P>
<P>
The council urged the state to find another location and noted that Inglewood 
already has two other halfway houses near the proposed site at 4026 Century 
Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
After all five councilmen condemned the project at Tuesday's meeting, 
Department of Corrections spokesman Nal Pedrosian said: "You've made yourself 
very clear without a shadow of a doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Dimaggio, regional administrator for the Department of Corrections, said 
Wednesday that the plan was dropped. "Without the local accord, we're not going 
to go forward." He criticized the city for opposing the program, saying that 
most of the people in the proposed program would be Inglewood residents. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the site, Irene Christopher, accused the councilmen of shirking 
their duty. 
</P>
<P>
"Some members of this council may wish to take the politically expedient easy 
way out in dealing with our community's need to reintroduce rehabilitated 
offenders into society," she said at the meeting. " . . . It would be great if 
doing what was right and what was popular were the same thing, but the 
decisions faced by an elected official are not easy."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INGLEWOOD LIFTS BUILDING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Inglewood City Council agreed Tuesday to lift a building moratorium on 
apartments and condominiums for 21 developments whose plans already had been 
submitted when a citywide moratorium went into effect last August. 
</P>
<P>
But seven other projects in that category will remain under the moratorium 
because they are planned for streets where apartment and condominium 
construction would have a significant impact on the area, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Those seven properties are on streets where most of the properties are 
single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen residents objected, arguing that the building ban should include 
all construction. 
</P>
<P>
The original moratorium only blocked submission of new plans. Last month, the 
city amended the moratorium to include the 28 properties whose plans had 
already been submitted. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the council exempted 21 of the projects, noting that they are in 
areas where substantial apartment and condominium development already exists. 
</P>
<P>
A moratorium on the submission of new plans for multifamily projects in the 
high-density R-3, R-4 and P-1 zones remains in effect. City officials said a 
comprehensive study of the city's density problems should be completed by May.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PAY-PHONE RESTRICTIONS PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to discourage drug dealers from using public phones to negotiate 
sales, the Hawthorne City Council voted unanimously to restrict pay phones in 
certain areas of the city to outgoing calls only. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, proposed two weeks ago by Councilwoman Ginny Lambert, was approved by 
the council Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, the city will restrict all public pay phones in areas 
where the Police Department has had the most complaints about loitering and 
narcotics sales. These areas are along Imperial Highway, between Inglewood and 
Doty Avenues; along Rosecrans Avenue and Crenshaw Boulevard, and along El 
Segundo Boulevard between Hawthorne Boulevard and Yukon Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Police Capt. Richard Prentice said the ordinance will take effect 
March 28, and the phones most likely will be converted to one-way calls before 
the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, GTE officials converted 20 phones in Venice near Ocean Front Walk and 
Horizon Avenue, and police said last fall that the number of complaints of 
late-night drug dealing at the phones had dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, the Inglewood City Council approved a program that urges private 
property owners to restrict certain phones to outgoing calls. Police officials 
said 13 phones have been modified. Councilman Jose Fernandez, who introduced 
the plan, said initial reports from the police indicate that the plan has 
reduced the use of public phones for drug transactions.

SOCKERS FIGHT BACK, ROUT SIDEKICKS; 
</P>
<P>
MISL: EIGHT SECOND-HALF SCORES LEAD TO 9-5 VICTORY IN DALLAS; WAAD HIRMEZ'S 
THIRD GOAL WITH FOUR SECONDS LEFT IGNITES BENCH-CLEARING BRAWL.

DALLAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sockers were already in a surly mood thanks to consecutive losses by a 
combined 14-2 margin entering Wednesday night's survival game against the 
Western Division-leading Dallas Sidekicks. All they needed was a little spark 
to light their short fuse. 
</P>
<P>
It came when referee Kelly Mock didn't call what the Sockers said was an 
obvious tripping foul against Tatu on his way to a goal in the third quarter. 
It gave Dallas a 2-1 lead but also made the Sockers fighting mad. 
</P>
<P>
Playing without Steve Zungul, Branko Segota and Brian Quinn, the Sockers scored 
eight second-half goals for a 9-5 victory before 5,787 at Reunion Arena in a 
game that ended in a bench-clearing brawl. 
</P>
<P>
After Waad Hirmez scored his third goal of the night with four seconds 
remaining, he went to his knees to celebrate. But before the ritual started, 
Dallas defender Richard Chinapoo approached, and the two exchanged shoves and 
shouts. The encounter quickly escalated as both benches emptied. Dallas 
defender Doc Lawson took on several Sockers and eventually threw a windmill 
right kick at Ralph Black. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson, Chinapoo and Terry Woodberry received penalties for Dallas, Black and 
Cacho for the Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
While Chinapoo had no comment, Hirmez blamed it on frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to my knees to celebrate and (Chinapoo) came at me," said Hirmez, who 
recorded his first hat trick in two years. "He told me 'Don't do that . . . in 
here' and then grabbed my shirt. I understand he was frustrated, and it 
happened in the heat of the moment, but he's got to take both the losing and 
the winning in this league." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson, a martial arts expert, said he was taking up for his teammate. 
</P>
<P>
"Their whole bench went after Richard, and I'm not going to sit there and take 
that," said Lawson, who said he and his teammates became upset when the Sockers 
called a timeout to "rub in" an 8-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"They're known for that kind of crap," he said, "but we don't respect a team 
that tries to make you look foolish at home. As for Ralph, he's always been an 
instigator. He attempted to kick me, but of course he had three guys standing 
in front of him. I don't like to fight, but if he was man enough, I would meet 
him where there were no referees or fines and the only thing you would hear 
about it would be the next day when he showed up at the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Black, who said Lawson's kick only glanced off his head, downplayed the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and Doc have been going at it for years," Black said. "He's the kind of guy 
who you fight on the field in the heat of battle and then go buy him a beer 
when it's over. But it was a pretty good kick. I guess he knows a little about 
karate." 
</P>
<P>
Almost lost was a game that the Sockers said could turn around a season going 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight we were missing the superstars, but we had a hard-working lineup, and 
it just clicked," Hirmez said. "This could turn our thing around, but we'll 
have to wait and see. I know that after that non-call on Tatu, we just got a 
little extra energy and then we did to their sixth attacker what teams have 
been doing to us lately." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers, who contended that Tatu tripped Ben Collins in order to get the 
ball en route to his first goal, made sure the non-call was insignificant by 
getting consecutive goals from Jacques Ladouceur and Zoran Karic and two from 
Hirmez for a 5-2 lead with 12:17 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like the ref put the whistle in his mouth but didn't blow it," said 
Ron Newman, the Sockers' coach. "It was a terrible non-call. If Tatu would've 
been on the other end of that, whistles would've been blowing from here to Fort 
Worth. We've wanted an effort like this for ages, and tonight we finally got 
it." 
</P>
<P>
After Dallas cut the lead to 5-3, the Sockers responded with goals against 
Dallas' sixth attacker by Jim Gabarra, George Fernandez and Karic to make it 
8-3 with 4:18 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers, who broke a two-game losing streak and ended Dallas' four-game 
winning streak, improved to 15-20 and pulled within six games of Dallas 
(21-14), which lost at home for only the fourth time in 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
Tatu, who also had a hat trick, scored two late goals for Dallas to increase 
his league-leading total to 46.

MORNINGSIDE COACH PLANS TO QUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl Franklin, one of the South Bay's winningest and most experienced 
basketball coaches, said it is doubtful that he will return for his 15th season 
at Morningside High School. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has not officially resigned, Franklin said he has informed 
Morningside's players of his plans to quit coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not burned out from coaching, but I'm at the crossroads of my career," 
said the 43-year-old administrator. "If I'm offered the dean's position on a 
full-time basis, I would take that over coaching." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin, Morningside's acting dean of students, hopes to assume the post on a 
permanent basis next school year, in addition to his duties as athletic 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin said the negative response from players and parents to his plans 
caught him by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the players want me to come back," he said. "And the parents want to 
know if there is anything they can do to encourage me to stay. I'll give it a 
lot of thought." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin has coached Morningside to 12 playoff appearances in 14 seasons and 
six league titles in the last seven years. The Monarchs, the top-ranked 
Division III team in the state most of season, were upset by Lompoc, 83-80, 
Feb. 20 in the Southern Section 3-AA quarterfinals to finish 24-4. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin said Ron Randle, who has served as co-coach since 1986, is the logical 
candidate to continue heading the program. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Grant, the 1975 L.A. City Section Player of the Year at Westchester High 
and a former pro player in the New York Mets organization, is the new baseball 
coach at South Torrance High. 
</P>
<P>
Grant, a catcher during his playing days, said he learned about the job opening 
in The Times and contacted South. He was named coach two weeks ago, which 
didn't leave much time to prepare for the season. 
</P>
<P>
South plays its first game at 3 p.m. Friday at Rolling Hills in the El Segundo 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a little behind everybody else, but it seems like a pretty good group of 
kids," Grant said. "I don't know if they're ballplayers yet, but we'll see. 
</P>
<P>
South's program has been on a decline since 1984, when it won the Southern 
Section 4-A championship. The Spartans were 7-17 last season and took seventh 
in the eight-team Ocean League. 
</P>
<P>
Grant, South's fourth coach in six years, previously coached pro baseball in 
Italy and as a walk-on at UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne baseball Coach Lester Sakurai calls his starting outfield of juniors 
Armando Fernandez, Alex Figueroa and Anthony Mosby the "St. Louis outfield" 
because of their outstanding speed. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez batted .413 and stole 19 bases last season on his way to earning 
All-South Bay honors as a sophomore. Sakurai also has high hopes for Figueroa, 
a transfer from Puerto Rico who will play center field for the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good-sized kid with a lot of power," Sakurai said. "He's almost as good 
as (Fernandez) in terms of his swing. And he's cat quick." 
</P>
<P>
When top-seeded Morningside (27-3) plays second-seeded Lynwood (25-1) for the 
Southern Section 5-AA girls basketball championship Friday night at UC Irvine, 
it will be a rematch of the 1988 4-A final won by Morningside, 60-55. 
</P>
<P>
Lynwood is the first Southern Section school since Long Beach Poly in 1980 to 
have both its boys and girls teams play for the major division title. 
</P>
<P>
Lynwood's boys team (30-1) meets Long Beach Poly (25-2) for the 5-AA crown 
Saturday night at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
So far, St. Bernard senior Terry Sullivan has limited his sports activities to 
football and basketball in high school. 
</P>
<P>
He was an All-Camino Real League defensive back and, as the starting point 
guard, helped the basketball team to the second round of the Southern Section 
3-A playoffs this season. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's trying his hand at baseball. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard Coach Bob Yarnall says Sullivan will be one of his top pitchers 
this season, even though he has no previous high school experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I've watched him through youth leagues, and I finally coaxed him to come out 
for the team," Yarnall said. "He's throwing really well." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, a right-hander, was impressive during a two-inning stint against 
University of West L.A. in a scrimmage Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't get anything off him," Yarnall said. "He's got a good fastball and 
a very good curve." 
</P>
<P>
You'd think John Stevenson wouldn't have a care in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The El Segundo baseball coach has a deep and talented team returning from last 
season, when the Eagles captured the Southern Section 2-A title. 
</P>
<P>
But Stevenson says replacing center fielder Erik Evans has proved to be a 
worrisome chore. 
</P>
<P>
"Evans looks to be impossible to replace," he said. "We really don't have a 
center fielder. We have pitchers and infielders, and a left fielder and a right 
fielder, but center field is a sore spot. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just throwing people out there. We really don't have anybody who is 
gifted and capable of playing the position. I'm talking about speed and arm and 
instinct." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson said the leading candidate to replace Evans, the Eagles' leader in 
runs batted in and stolen bases last season, is 6-foot-5, 230-pound Kenny 
Talanoa, not exactly your prototype center fielder. 
</P>
<P>
"Every outfielder is a candidate," Stevenson said. "Talanoa might be the 
leading candidate just because of his exceptional arm. He's a very determined 
competitor." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery relief pitcher Brian Papia, who the led the area with seven 
saves last season -- the fourth-highest mark in Southern Section history -- is 
appropriately nicknamed "Ice Man." 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES: Doug Kay's goal three minutes into sudden-death overtime lifted 
second-seeded Palos Verdes past host Edison of Huntington Beach, 1-0, Tuesday 
in the semifinals of the Southern Section 4-A soccer playoffs. The defending 
champion Sea Kings (28-2-2) will meet top-seeded Simi Valley (28-1) for the 4-A 
title at 8 p.m. Friday at Gahr High in Cerritos. . . . South Torrance girls 
soccer team had its season ended Tuesday in a 2-1 loss to host El Toro in the 
4-A semifinals. The Spartans finished 18-6-1. . . . Former Palos Verdes gymnast 
Danielle Leone, the 1988 CIF Individual champion, made the women's team at 
Stanford as a walk-on and has consistently ranked among the Cardinal's top five 
performers, said Palos Verdes Coach Jim Mitchell.

RANCHO SANTIAGO PROVES TOO MUCH FOR HARBOR, 105-86

Harbor College Coach Ken Curry is fond of saying that if you can't get your 
stallion running, you've got to go to your mare. 
</P>
<P>
It took Harbor too long to get either of its horses going Wednesday night in 
the second round of the Southern California community college regionals. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Nelson and Eric Carpenter, Harbor's leading scorers, started slowly and a 
well-balanced Rancho Santiago team, the No. 3 seed in the regionals, ran away 
to a 105-86 victory at Rancho Santiago's Cook Gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago (28-3) had five players score in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
"We always talk about weapons," Curry said. "Well, they had a hell of a lot of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Lien, Rancho Santiago's 6-foot-9 center and leading scorer, picked up 
his second foul two minutes into the game. But the rest of the Dons, especially 
forward Corie Blount and guard Gene Altamirano, picked up the slack for him. 
</P>
<P>
Blount scored 10 of his 17 points in the first half, mostly on soft hook shots 
in the key. And Altamirano bombed away from the perimeter, finishing with 19 
points and three three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
"We got rid of one of their big guys but then we couldn't defend the others," 
Curry said. "And no matter who they stuck out there on the wing, they made 
'em." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago shot a blistering 61% in the first half to take a 48-32 lead. 
Harbor shot only 34% in the half. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Nelson and Carpenter got on track, it was too late for Harbor,

EL CAMINO RACES PAST L.A. CITY COLLEGE FOR 2ND PLAYOFF UPSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
There's a big sign inside the L.A. City College gym that says "welcome to speed 
city." The logo is appropriate considering that the Cubbies lead the state with 
104 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
But in Wednesday's second-round playoff game, speed was not enough to defeat a 
determined El Camino team, which slipped away with a 97-90 victory. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. City Coach Reggie Morris would not comment about the physical game, which 
saw three of his players ejected after an altercation. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in a row, El Camino beat a higher-ranked team on the road. 
Now the Warriors advance to the regional bracket finals Saturday against 
Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
The 23rd-seeded Warriors (22-10) beat 10th-seeded Santa Monica on Saturday 
before defeating seventh-seeded L.A. City (23-9), the winner of the Southern 
California Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Coach Ron McClurkin said it was the best game he's ever been involved 
with. "It had everything. The guys were intense and we played all out. I'm glad 
we're 23rd!" 
</P>
<P>
Four El Camino players scored in double figures. Sophomore forward David Keeter 
led the pack with 23 points, and Steve Leary had 17. Guards Larry Lockley and 
Frank Beatty had 12 and 13 respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors came out a bit slow, falling behind in the opening minutes. But 
they led 18-17 after a Steven Leary dunk with 11:13 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubbies regained the lead with a six-point run that included two slam dunks 
by sophomore forward Marcus Nash and a one-handed jam by freshman guard Charlo 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors then padded L.A. City's lead by committing three turnovers in the 
last minute of the half. The Cubbies scored six unanswered points that gave 
them a 49-42 halftime edge. 
</P>
<P>
But the Warriors went on a 10-point run early in the second half that put them 
up 61-56 with 12:49 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. City tied the game at 74 thanks to five Chris Small points. The sophomore 
guard made a 15-footer and less than a minute later sank a rainbow 
three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Cubbies got out of control. With 5:24 remaining, three of their 
players -- two of them starters -- were ejected after an altercation under El 
Camino's basket. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. City got slapped with five technical fouls. Allen Caveness made one of his 
two free throws and freshman Michael Houck sank his four, giving the Warriors 
an 82-74 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubbies never caught up. El Camino applied a fierce full-court press that 
prevented L.A. City from driving the ball up court. 
</P>
<P>
Small led L.A. City with a game-high 27 points.

LORD, GLENDALE COME OF AGE AND KNOCK OFF CERRITOS, 71-63 
</P>

<P>
A year of playoff experience continues to pay big dividends for the Glendale 
College men's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, a mostly freshman Vaquero team folded in the final minutes of a 
second-round game against then-defending state champion El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night against Cerritos, Glendale once again found itself in a close 
game with a defending state champion. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, the sophomore-dominated Vaqueros stayed calm and upset the 
Falcons, 71-63, in the semifinals of the Southern California regional playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (24-11) will meet Rancho Santiago, a 105-86 winner over Harbor, on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will advance to the eight-team state final March 8-10 at the Bren 
Center at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos finished its season 22-11. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight, we really stepped up when it was crucial," Glendale Coach Brian 
Beauchemin said. "We made some very big plays." 
</P>
<P>
None were bigger than two steals by Justin Lord with less than 2 minutes 30 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale, which led for most of the game, had taken a 64-60 lead on a basket by 
Gary Fowler with 2:27 left when Lord deflected a Cerritos pass in the backcourt 
that resulted in a steal by Fowler. Vigen Serop made the Falcons pay for their 
error by sinking a pair of free throws with 1:40 left to put the Vaqueros 
ahead, 66-60. 
</P>
<P>
Lord then provided the crushing blow on Cerritos' ensuing possession when he 
stole a pass at the Falcons' free-throw line and dribbled the length of the 
court for a dunk. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense is what won us the game," Lord said. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Swanson's hot hand also contributed significantly to the Vaqueros' 
victory. Swanson, a sophomore forward from Alemany High, celebrated his 21st 
birthday by scoring a game-high 27 points and grabbing a team-high 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Lord added 19 points and Bruce Heicke and Fowler scored 11 and eight points, 
respectively, for the Vaqueros. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Roczey scored a team-high 20 points for Cerritos as the Vaqueros limited 
guard Wayne Gipson -- the most valuable player of the South Coast Conference -- 
to 11 points, six below his season average. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we peaked out at this time," Swanson said. "This year, our 
determination is still peaking." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale led, 31-29, at halftime behind the play of Lord, who scored 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros got a break three minutes into the game when Cerritos forward Clay 
Schwartz, who averages 10 points and a team-high eight rebounds, sustained an 
ankle injury that kept him out of the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale also took advantage of the Falcons' cold shooting to forge a 17-10 
lead with 14:47 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos then went on a 9-2 run and tied the score, 19-19, on a basket by 
Roczey, who had 10 points in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale went back on top, 27-21 on a three-point shot by Swanson.

<P>
PREP BASKETBALL: PLAYING IN THE 4-A FINALS WILL BE THE REALIZATION OF A DREAM 
FOR WEST HIGH BEST FRIENDS ROSA OLLOQUE AND MARY LITZENBERG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE RAATZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
West Torrance High's Rosa Olloque and Mary Litzenberg have been a tandem for 
over half a decade, and Friday night's Southern Section 4-A girls basketball 
championship game against La Quinta at Cal Poly Pomona represents the 
culmination of their work -- and play -- together. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always dreamed about this," said Olloque, a 5-foot-4 point guard 
averaging 22 points and 8.4 assists a game. "Going to the finals, taking the 
championship, winning it all." 
</P>
<P>
Little did Litzenberg know that it would come to this when she first saw 
Olloque play six years ago. From the beginning, she recognized Olloque as a 
special athlete, though. 
</P>
<P>
As a sixth-grader, Olloque was playing for a Torrance Parks and Recreation team 
against Litzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"She just drove to the basket every time down the court," said the 5-7 
Litzenberg, who has started in the Warriors' back court opposite Olloque for 
three seasons. "She was just very aggressive -- actually, not much different 
from the way she is now." 
</P>
<P>
That one game made quite an impression on Litzenberg, who convinced Olloque to 
join a Redondo Beach youth basketball team coached by Litzenberg's father. The 
two players have been together ever since. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors' 23-4 record is largely because of the compatibility of Olloque 
and Litzenberg, the team's top scorers, Coach Kevin McManus said. 
</P>
<P>
"They do opposite things," he said. "So they really complement each other." 
</P>
<P>
Litzenberg, averaging 14.2 points and 9.9 rebounds, concurred, explaining: "I 
know her style, and she knows mine. She drives for layups and passes, while I 
rebound and shoot outside. We always know what we're going to do because we've 
played together for so long now." 
</P>
<P>
West's starting guards first began getting recognition last season, when they 
were both named All-Ocean League as juniors. This season they have performed 
even better, helping the Warriors to a second-place Ocean League finish at 
12-2. 
</P>
<P>
The average margin in their league wins was 18.8 points, and both of the losses 
came to powerful Morningside, which plays Lynwood in the 5-AA championship game 
Friday night at UC Irvine. In one of the losses to the Monarchs, the Warriors 
held 6-foot-5 Lisa Leslie, who would later score 101 points in one half against 
South Torrance, to just two points. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, McManus credited his back court for shutting down the Morningside 
center. "We kept her outside on the perimeter, in the middle of the court, 
where my players are better than she is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McManus also said that the poise of Litzenberg and Olloque enable him to employ 
a hands-off coaching style. 
</P>
<P>
"I've only called one timeout in the playoffs," he said. "We run and gun, but 
(Olloque and Litzenberg) are in control out there. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have too much to do with it, and that's the way it should be." 
</P>
<P>
Litzenberg added: "Experience is probably our biggest strength. We know when to 
slow it down, when to take shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Like last week against Bishop (Montgomery). We were ahead late in the game, 
and we knew they would just start fouling us. We were prepared for that 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
The Olloque-Litzenberg partnership extends beyond basketball. Olloque was a 
14-game winner as a softball pitcher for West last season and has a chance to 
reach the top of the school's career victory list. Litzenberg is her catcher. 
</P>
<P>
"She's great to have as a catcher," said Olloque, who hopes to play basketball 
in college. "She's always giving me advice and trying to build up my 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her success in both sports, Olloque said she often needs a confidence 
boost. 
</P>
<P>
"I always get butterflies before a game," she said. "Ever since I first started 
playing it's been that way, even if we're supposed to have an easy game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always nervous. But I feel even more nervous whenever Mary is out of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Olloque added that Litzenberg's dependability is crucial to her own success. "I 
feel more confident when Mary is out there because I know she can do the job," 
she said. "It seems like she's always there for a pass, or if I take a shot 
she'll be there for the rebound. We've been through a lot together." 
</P>
<P>
McManus said that their understanding of each other's role is important. 
</P>
<P>
"Mary's told me many times, all her life she's come in second to Rosa," the 
coach said. "But they're together all year round, and have been since the 
seventh grade. And because of that, Mary doesn't mind playing that second role, 
although it's not really too secondary." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Litzenberg admitted that she has given up trying to outdo Olloque, an 
All-CIF pick last season, and said that there is no rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to keep my style and haven't tried to be a Rosa," she said. "If we did 
the same type of things, if we weren't as different as we are, it would make it 
easier for other teams to guard us." 
</P>
<P>
Olloque added, besides being good teammates, "We are good friends." 
</P>
<P>
Litzenberg said: "I don't ever get sick of her. In fact, I'm looking forward to 
softball season with her. It's not as serious as basketball. Or, at least, it's 
a different type of thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Her role as Olloque's emotional supporter changes with the seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"She's more controlled in softball," Litzenberg said. "It's slower, so you have 
to be controlled. My approach with her is different in each sport. Basketball 
is mostly instincts." And, clearly, Olloque's basketball instincts tell her to 
try to drive to the basket every time she touches the ball. To her, it's just 
the obvious thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," she said, "every chance I get, if I see a hole I'll do it. I'm not 
scared to drive. I can remember driving to the basket from the very first time 
I played." 
</P>
<P>
Olloque added that that intense quest for the hoop relates to her sense of 
urgency on the court. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps me to be nervous because it makes me more alert," she said. "That 
way, I'm aggressive and intense." 
</P>
<P>
With the steady Litzenberg right behind her every step of the way.

MIRA COSTA, NO. 1 IN NATION, TO OPEN VOLLEYBALL SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mira Costa High's boys volleyball team, ranked No. 1 in the nation by USA 
Today, will open the season at 7:30 Friday night with a non-league match at 
Loyola High, west of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
This marks the 11th consecutive season the Mustangs have opened against Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa leads the series, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Cook's squad returns three starters from last year's team that came 
within one victory of a CIF title and a perfect season. The Mustangs lost to 
Corona del Mar in the Southern Section 4-A final to finish 21-1. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa will center its attack around 6-foot-4 setter Canyon Ceman, 6-5 
middle blocker Patrick Ivie and 6-4 outside hitter David Swatik, a first-team 
All-CIF choice last season. 
</P>
<P>
The three seniors, along with 6-7 middle blocker Mike Ashenfelter, are all 
being heavily recruited by major colleges, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Outside hitter Mark Shoptaw, a 6-3 junior, is the top varsity newcomer. 
</P>
<P>
"I call them the Magnificent Five," Cook said of his leading players. "We're 
just trying to find another one to fill out a starting lineup." 
</P>
<P>
After Friday's match, Mira Costa resumes play March 9 at Palisades, one of the 
top teams in the L.A. City Section. ROB FERNAS

WRESTLER FULFILLS OWN ULTIMATUM; 
</P>
<P>
INGLEWOOD: DANNY KATOA DOESN'T WASTE HIS TIME ANYMORE WITH FIGHTS AT SCHOOL, 
GANGS OR FAILURE. INSTEAD, HE CONCENTRATES ON SUCCESS IN SPORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS KAISER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Danny Katoa has a simple resolve -- if it wastes his time, walk away. 
</P>
<P>
Katoa, a 17-year-old junior at Morningside High School, realized early that 
running around with gangs was a waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
So he got out. 
</P>
<P>
Katoa was prepared to give up wrestling just as easily after he had a 
disappointing season as a sophomore. He didn't place at the Southern Section 
3-A finals, and he knew that he should have. 
</P>
<P>
"I set one goal this year: If I didn't win CIF, I wouldn't wrestle anymore," 
Katoa said. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to have been an ultimatum that inspired him. In fact, it has been 
quite a year for Katoa. 
</P>
<P>
He placed second in the Southern Section Masters Meet last Saturday, qualifying 
him for the state meet Friday and Saturday at the University of the Pacific in 
Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
Katoa is the first Morningside wrestler to qualify for state. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ronnel Lone, now a junior, won the 165-pound division at the 3-A 
finals but didn't place at the Masters. Morningside wrestling Coach Joey 
Robinson says Lone couldn't wrestle this year because of academic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Katoa advanced to state by winning the 191-pound division at the 3-A finals two 
weeks ago and then by placing second at the Masters Meet. He has a 40-4-1 
record this year. 
</P>
<P>
But wrestling isn't Katoa's only sport at Morningside, a school known more for 
basketball and football. 
</P>
<P>
He is a three-year starter on the Morningside football team. Last fall, he was 
selected as an all-Ocean League linebacker and a second-team All-South Bay pick 
by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
This year certainly has been in contrast to Katoa's life as an early teen, when 
he ran around with gangs. 
</P>
<P>
He said that in junior high school he was kicked out of school once and 
suspended five times. He got in fights nearly every day. 
</P>
<P>
"I basically didn't have any friends, but some of my friends were in gangs and 
I hung with them," he said. "I walked away (from the gangs), because, looking 
back, I was wasting my time." 
</P>
<P>
Katoa said the change came when his father, a concrete contractor, gave him the 
choice of straightening out and staying in school or coming to work with him. 
</P>
<P>
Given that, school didn't seem so bad after all. The work, Katoa decided, was 
too hard. 
</P>
<P>
Katoa is a native of Tonga, an island near Fiji in the South Pacific. Katoa's 
family -- two brothers, two sisters, their mother and grandfather -- moved from 
Tonga seven years ago and joined his father, who had already settled in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
The move was quite a change from the peaceful, Hawaiian-like world Katoa knew 
the first 10 years of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big change," he said. "The environment, the people -- all this 
gang-banging going on here. I had to get away from that." 
</P>
<P>
Katoa has directed into athletics the energy that used to get him into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I take everything I see and use it (in athletics)," Katoa said. "I'm a violent 
guy, but I'm in sports, so I use it on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Katoa gets in his licks. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll go after you and bang heads with you," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
His football coach, Ron Tatum, describes Katoa as hard-headed, hard-hitting and 
rougher than most. 
</P>
<P>
"He backs down to no challenge, and his attitude is a toughness that he carries 
with him," Tatum said. 
</P>
<P>
But he also has a softer side. And that sets Katoa apart. 
</P>
<P>
"As a freshman he became one of the leaders on the football team and had to set 
an example for everyone else," Robinson said. "Like Lisa Leslie (a standout 
girls basketball player at Morningside), the kids at school look up to them. 
Other kids look around and say, 'If they can do it, so can I.' It gives them a 
way out." 
</P>
<P>
Katoa said he helped get one of his football teammates out of a gang this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was down there before, and I feel I can help get them straightened out," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tatum said Katoa often goes out of his way to get other youths to work out with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
But Katoa is held accountable by more than just his peers. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows if he messes up, his dad, his football coach (Tatum) and me will be 
all over him," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Even his old friends, some of whom are still in gangs, motivate him. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they encourage me," Katoa said. "And when I try to hang with them, they 
won't let me. They know they are wasting their time. They say, 'Keep going on, 
maybe someday you'll be on TV and be famous.' "

EVERYBODY HELPS AS UNIVERSITY CITY TOPS TORREY PINES

University City's Anthony Hill said his coach told the team before Wednesday's 
night Division II San Diego Section boys' basketball semifinal that they were a 
better team than Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
Were they ever. 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded University City dominated top-seeded Torrey Pines in every phase, 
including three-point shooting, and rolled to an easy, 75-58 victory at San 
Dieguito High. 
</P>
<P>
University received career performances from just about all eight players, but 
it was Hill who was most instrumental. 
</P>
<P>
He scored a game-high 22 points, 11 in each half, had six steals and hounded 
Torrey Pines' Kyle Armstrong into a miserable, one-for-nine shooting night. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong had been averaging 12 points and two three-pointers a game. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was kind of cocky, from what I could see against Helix (in the 
quarterfinals)," said Hill, a 6-1 senior-point guard. "I wanted him." 
</P>
<P>
Hill also gave Armstrong a three-point shooting lesson, hitting four from 
three-point range to Armstrong's one. 
</P>
<P>
"He played the best game of his life," University Coach Tom Medigovich said of 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Medigovich probably could have said the same thing about reserve forward John 
Schweller, who scored 10 second-half points and grabbed four rebounds. He even 
took one away from teammate Jerome Price, the state-long jump champion. 
</P>
<P>
"He had no business in there," Hill said of Schweller's rebound and subsequent 
basket in the lane. 
</P>
<P>
University also got six points off the bench from Joel Mitchell and four from 
Elliot Alexander. Price finished with 12 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks, 
and Supe Hooper added 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
Bart Brandenburg led Torrey Pines with 17 points, and Carter Brown added 14. 
</P>
<P>
University City led, 13-9 after a quarter 31-22 at halftime and 49-37 after 
three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines shot just seven for 21 in the first half and 12 for 29 in the 
second. University City shot 19 for 36 in the second half and 11 for 25 in the 
first. 
</P>
<P>
University City improved to 23-4. Torrey Pines finished at 26-4. DAVE McKIBBEN

In the other Division II semifinal: 
</P>
<P>
El Camino 63, San Pasqual 49 -- The record was already even. What El Camino 
wanted to do was set it straight. 
</P>
<P>
In previous meetings of the Avocado League rivals, San Pasqual and El Camino 
each had won once. Trouble was, El Camino's first victory was considered by 
many a fluke because San Pasqual was without the help of Erik Meek. 
</P>
<P>
Then in the second game, and with Meek, San Pasqual won. 
</P>
<P>
The third and most important meeting didn't disappoint, and the lopsided score 
wasn't indicative of the the game up until the final eight minutes, during 
which El Camino outscored San Pasqual, 29-18. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual led, 31-30, with 2:20 to go in the third. But then El Camino's Jeff 
Reeves scored on a layup, and the Wildcats never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
Meek finished with 21 points for San Pasqual. El Camino was paced by Glenn 
Ankton with 17. 
</P>
<P>
Division V semifinals 
</P>
<P>
Christian 57, Bishop's 50 -- Tony Clark had 18 of his game-high 40 points in 
the third quarter as Christian, the No. 3-seeded team, pulled away from 
second-seeded Bishop's at Santana High. The Patriots (15-11) advanced to the 
final against top-seeded Calipatria Saturday morning at 11:30 at Golden Hall. 
Bishop's finished 23-5. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, the county's leading scorer, was "held" to four below his season 
average, but at the end of the third quarter, Clark had 34 points, Bishop's 30. 
</P>
<P>
Calipatria 47, Marian 39 -- David Oyama scored all of his nine points in the 
first half as top-seeded Calipatria (21-3) took a 23-15 halftime lead at 
Santana High. Cesar Romero had a game-high 13 points for top-seeded Calipatria 
(21-3). Marian finished 10-16.

HAPPILY FOR SAN PASQUAL, PLAN A WORKS JUST FINE

<P>
The thing about contingency plans is this: 
</P>
<P>
They're nice to have sitting in the shadows. They're a welcome addition if 
needed, but it's just as well if they aren't. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night in a San Diego Section girls' Division II basketball semifinal 
at Mira Mesa, San Pasqual stuck instead to its original scheme and in doing so 
easily defeated El Cajon Valley, 71-59. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual was seriously challenged just once, when El Cajon made a run early 
in the fourth quarter and closed the gap to 50-42. But it didn't worry San 
Pasqual much. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't too concerned," San Pasqual Coach Terri Bamford said. "That's why I 
called a timeout." 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Eagles then went back to the 12- and 13-points lead it had 
established early on, and the victory was theirs. 
</P>
<P>
The night before, things weren't quite as rosy for second-ranked San Pasqual 
(24-4). During Tuesday's practice, junior center Becki Callahan, a significant 
part of Plan A, sprained her right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Callahan said she was in therapy twice during the day, but it wasn't until 
pregame warm-ups that Bamford decided to play her. 
</P>
<P>
"We watched her during warm-ups," Bamford said. "She couldn't really go off it 
right." 
</P>
<P>
But she did so adequately enough to score 18 points, behind teammates Nikki 
Gannon (20) and Valerie Ryan (19). 
</P>
<P>
So what was the plan had Callahan been unable to play? 
</P>
<P>
"Wendy Hill," Bamford said. 
</P>
<P>
Bamford would have started Hill at center and moved another player to forward, 
where Hill started. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, both players got themselves in foul trouble. Callahan had 
four at the half, Hill four going into the fourth quarter. Hill fouled out with 
7:31 to play, and four minutes later, Callahan followed her to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little worried," Callahan said. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual went to the 2-A final in 1987, won Division II in 1988 and lost in 
the first round last year, Bamford's first.

<P>
Sales totaled a record $416 million, up slightly. Fourth quarter profit soared 
77% to $2.7 million on sales of $106 million, a gain of 9%. The El Segundo firm 
attributed the quarterly results to higher sales and profits at its electronics 
marketing group and a lower effective tax rate.

Fleetwood Enterprises Inc.: Third-quarter profit fell 28% to $9.1 million on 
revenue of $347.4 million, up slightly from year-ago revenue of $346.8 million. 
The Riverside-based maker of motor homes, travel trailers and manufactured 
housing said the decline resulted primarily from lower profit margins because 
of competitive market conditions and a shift to lower-priced models. Results 
for 1990 also include a non-recurring loss related to the sale of two idle 
plants.

U.S., JAPANESE FIRMS WILL JOINTLY BUILD HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Housing developer Leisure Technology announced Wednesday that it has entered 
into a partnership with Tokyo-based Hazama USA Corp. and a consortium of three 
other Japanese contractors to develop an adult community in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
The development is one of several housing projects recently taken on by 
Japanese contractors, said Kenichi Iwao, preconstruction manager at Hazama, 
which has its U.S. headquarters in Los Angeles. The Escondido deal is the 
second housing project Hazama has entered into since it began doing business in 
the United States in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Hazama, a subsidiary of Tokyo-based Hazama Corp., has since become involved in 
15 development projects, including office and industrial buildings and hotels. 
But the Escondido venture and a project in Long Beach, on which construction is 
to begin in May, are Hazama's first housing ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Ground breaking on the first phase of the 525-unit Escondido project, called 
Leisure Oaks Escondido, is scheduled in June and will include 175 
single-family, detached homes for people 55 and older. 
</P>
<P>
The project will be similar to but smaller than Leisure Technology's 1,650-unit 
Ocean Hills development in Oceanside. It will feature a 17,000-square-foot 
recreation center, a nine-hole golf course, a junior Olympic swimming pool, 
tennis courts and a neighborhood clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The development, in the Jesmond Dene area in north Escondido, has been 
challenged by slow-growth advocates in the city for 4 1/2 years, and has yet to 
receive final approval from the City Council. Although the project has been 
scaled down from its original 765 units, the council is still suggesting 
significant revisions. 
</P>
<P>
Among the objections raised by council members was the age restriction, with 
one council member objecting to the "graying" of the community. 
</P>
<P>
Iwao said Hazama and other Japanese contractors are exploring real estate 
investments other than office buildings and hotels because of the economic 
conditions in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"In the downtown areas, especially in Los Angeles, there is an oversupply of 
office space. (Demand) is not growing at this moment, and people are not 
looking to expand into the offices and move into new buildings," Iwao said. 
"Also, there is too much risk involved in the hotel business." 
</P>
<P>
The housing market, however, despite the recently flat sales in Southern 
California homes, provides a much brighter outlook for development because of 
projected continued population growth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the housing market, the growth ratio is much higher, especially in Southern 
California due to the Pacific Rim tie-in. We expect a lot of the Japanese and 
Asians coming to this market as well, as the Eastern people moving in," Iwao 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Iwao pointed out that Hazama's joint venture with Leisure Technology is neither 
the first nor the largest housing venture by Japanese firms. 
</P>
<P>
The Takamaka Corp. has already begun building in Palm Springs, and Kajima, one 
of the largest Japanese contracting firms, has a residential project under way 
in Las Vegas, Iwao said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, although housing prices in some parts of Southern California have 
increased substantially, houses in inland areas and the San Diego area are more 
affordable. 
</P>
<P>
Hazama USA is the lead Japanese investor in the project, with 23% equity 
interest. Other investors include Starts International California, Matsukyu USA 
and N. Hasegawa. Los Angeles-based Leisure Technology, which will retain a 50% 
equity interest, is the largest nationwide developer of "active adult" 
retirement communities. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Financial Officer John Kilduff estimated that revenues from the 525-unit 
venture will reach $200 million over five years, but said he could not quote 
the cost of the project, only that it will be "something less than" the 
projected revenue. Prices for the houses have not been released. 
</P>
<P>
The five-year project is the second venture Leisure Technology has engaged in 
with Japanese firms. Last March, the firm entered a $71-million joint venture 
with Nisshin Steel Co. to develop 44 full-service retirement communities over 
the next 15 years, including the expansion of Leisure Technology's Ocean Hills 
development in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
"We had made a strategic decision that, if the company was to grow in the 
future, one of the ways to do it was to go into joint ventures," Kilduff said. 
"We were introduced to Hazama, and there was a commonality of interests. We 
have been and continue to be very impressed with their local management."

IRT Corp. said it has signed a letter of intent with an investor group for a 
private financing arrangement that could raise $3 million to $4 million for the 
company through the sale of convertible preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
The investor group is led by Euro-American-I LP of Menlo Park. The deal is 
contingent on the company renegotiating its existing banking arrangements with 
Sanwa Bank and Citicorp. 
</P>
<P>
"While preliminary indications from both Citicorp and Sanwa Bank are 
encouraging, there can be no present assurances that the existing bank credit 
agreements can be successfully renegotiated to the satisfaction of the investor 
group," the company said in a statement.

ICA SEEKS CHAPTER 11 AFTER IMPERIAL SEIZURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imperial Corp. of America, the San Diego-based parent company of Imperial 
Savings Assn. has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court in San Diego, the company said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Savings, the nation's 16th largest S&amp;L, was one of 12 troubled 
thrifts that were seized Friday by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial, which had $9.7 billion in assets on Dec. 31, also reported $9.6 
billion in liabilities and a negative net worth of $60.1 million, according to 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial was by far the largest single business owned by ICA, which also owns a 
handful of relatively small insurance, investment and real estate operations. 
ICA reported a $136.2-million net loss for the nine-month period ended Sept. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing "will protect ICA's present assets, 
consolidate pending disputes and litigation in one court and give the company 
an opportunity to file a plan of reorganization," according to a press release 
issued Wednesday by ICA. 
</P>
<P>
ICA Chief Executive Lyman Hamilton said the filing will "protect our 
bondholders, shareholders and continue our operating businesses. . . . We 
believe this was a prudent thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L industry analysts earlier in the week predicted that ICA would be 
forced into bankruptcy court following the seizure of Imperial Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's filing contained no details about ICA's financial health. Filings 
to be made during the next two weeks will describe the company's assets and 
liabilities, said Patrick Shea, a San Diego-based attorney who is representing 
ICA in the bankruptcy filing.

Wednesday's filing did not affect Imperial Savings, which is being operated on 
a day-to-day basis by the federal Resolution Trust Corp., which disposes of 
failed banks and thrifts.

THERE'S A NEW 'A-TEAM' IN TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN KINGSBURY, Kingsbury is a Canoga Park free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are times when they seem like any other El Camino Real High School 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Food runs to Taco Bell. Fast cars. KROQ radio station. Basketball pickup games. 
Prom planning. And lots of Cherry Coke. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be fooled. 
</P>
<P>
These nine teen-agers are the finest examples of academic excellence in the Los 
Angeles Unified School District. They are this year's Academic Decathlon city 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not how you'd picture an Academic Decathlon team," said Mike Johnson, 
17, one of El Camino's team members. "We're real loose. We joke around a lot, 
and it kind of keeps us going." 
</P>
<P>
Leading up to the competition, the El Camino team spends more than 30 hours a 
week joking -- and studying -- for the March 9 California Academic Decathlon in 
Bakersfield. For the past two years, LAUSD has been represented by nearby Taft 
High School in Woodland Hills. Last year the Taft students went on to win the 
national competition, but this year El Camino edged them out to capture its 
first city title. 
</P>
<P>
"We have quite a tradition to uphold," said El Camino Academic Decathlon 
sponsor Mark Johnson. "If Taft can do it, we can do it. We want to win the 
national championship." 
</P>
<P>
This is Mark Johnson's third year coaching the El Camino decathlon team. Two 
years ago the team finished third, and last year it was second to Taft. 
</P>
<P>
"It was time," Johnson said. "This is our year." 
</P>
<P>
For three years, Johnson has set the tone for the study sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"I always tell them they're going to lose," Johnson said, trying to maintain a 
serious expression. "I told them that all the way to the city competition and 
look what happened. I'm telling them that still." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 30, may be a history teacher, but he is all teen-ager at heart. The 
students say he is the reason they tried out for the team. 
</P>
<P>
"He is great and he keeps us going," said Chris Shellen, a team member. "He's 
never serious." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has a theory: If El Camino Real doesn't win the state championship, 
they will beat up the winners and steal their trophies. 
</P>
<P>
"That way I figure we'll come home with something," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's sarcastic, light-hearted attitude has rubbed off on the team. 
</P>
<P>
His mental list of the team members, who are all 17 or 18, goes something like 
this: 
</P>
<P>
The Hard Worker: Jennifer Aaron began studying for Academic Decathlon last 
summer while on a trip to Europe with her parents. She said there are times 
when she feels like giving up, but she stays with it because she believes in 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
The Actress: Maki Becker is the most dramatic of the group. She often 
instigates a "silly session" by slipping into one of several characters and 
prancing around the room until the entire team is laughing. She gave up drama 
for Academic Decathlon this year because, she said, "It's a crazy group and I'm 
a crazy person." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Mellow: Mike Johnson never lets them see him sweat. He is the only team 
member to have an outside job; he works at Sears. He dresses in his senior 
class sweat shirt with his girlfriend's class ring dangling on a chain around 
his neck. He recently performed a lip-syncing routine with several of his 
teammates who got on their knees and mouthed the words to "Short People." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Nice Guy: Min Lee laughs with the rest of them when studying turns to 
one-liners, but he doesn't make many comebacks. "Poor Min is too nice to defend 
himself," Mark Johnson said. "By the time he thinks of a retort, we're four 
comments ahead of him." Lee is also a volunteer worker at Humana West Hills 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The Instigator: Jon Lynn will do anything for a laugh. He has been known to 
practice impromptu speeches on topics such as the importance of rotisserie 
baseball leagues and the irrelevance of philosophers. He enjoys memorizing 
baseball statistics and Academic Decathlon scores. "He is the funniest person 
I've ever known," Mark Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Brain: Amir Nashat wants nothing less than to finish the state competition 
with the single best score in California. At the city competition he finished 
second overall -- behind Min Lee. "It's an intense competition between the 
two," Johnson said. "Of course, since they're both on my team, I encourage it 
to be as fierce as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The Athlete: Steve Oh finished fourth in the city wrestling meet last year and 
this year had a shot at winning it all, but chose Academic Decathlon instead. 
"Nothing beats it," Oh said. Oh doesn't go much for the joking but appreciates 
the fun his teammates have. He would rather conduct short, intense study 
sessions and spend his free time working out and singing in his Christian 
church choir. He speaks fluent Korean. 
</P>
<P>
The Blonde: Chris Shellen is the subject of many team jokes. Her teammates say 
she had two strikes against her -- she is the only blonde and comes from 
Montana. Teammate Lynn reminds her often, "Only two things come from Montana: 
You and lots of cows." Once she approached the speech teacher for advice on her 
Academic Decathlon entry and was mistaken for an office girl. She wound up 
writing her first-place speech on stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
The Serious One: Natasha Song has entered the war for top scorer between Lee 
and Nashat. "She spends more time studying for this competition than most 
people spend studying for the bar exam," her coach said. She enjoys studying 
and going over lecture notes. 
</P>
<P>
The team spends five hours a day after school in Room 111 in the B-Building. 
This is Johnson's history classroom but since November, when the team won the 
city competition, it has become a center for learning everything from the 
latest jokes to the latest chemistry data. 
</P>
<P>
The room is cluttered. Textbooks litter Johnson's desk. "Economics." "American 
Indians." "Advanced Mathematics." It all seems very academic until visitors 
notice a painted sign on the back wall that reads: "Akademik Decathalon." The 
words are circled with question marks. 
</P>
<P>
Each weekday afternoon, the El Camino team typically listens to lectures on 
social science, fine arts, mathematics, literature, economics and science -- 
including physics, biology and chemistry. The rest of the afternoon and part of 
the evening is spent giving mock speeches, writing essays and practicing for 
the Super Quiz, which this year is about American Indians. The decathlon covers 
each of the areas equally. 
</P>
<P>
"Lecturers bring in the latest information and are experts in preparing for the 
Academic Decathlon," said Johnson, who has solicited teachers from across the 
district to lecture at El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, chemistry teacher Richard Erdman from Venice High School interrupted 
a food break by lecturing the El Camino Real team on molecular bonding. 
</P>
<P>
Taco containers and onion rings littered the desks as Erdman handed them a 
sheet full of chemistry topics that might appear on the test. The sheet 
contained words foreign to most college graduates: High ionization, dipole 
attraction, electronegativity differences, multiple co-available bonds, 
non-polar molecules. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly the students shifted gears and began listening to Erdman the way most 
teen-agers listen to high school gossip. 
</P>
<P>
"Which force bonds a noble gas atom in the liquid phase?" Erdman asked. 
</P>
<P>
Becker raised her hand. "Hydrogen." 
</P>
<P>
"Right. Otherwise your DNA falls down." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we don't want that," Lynn piped up from the back of the classroom. 
"Never know what might happen if your genes fall down at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
"Only you would know about that, Jon," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the academic elite added comments and it was a few minutes before 
order returned to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember the neutron bomb idea," Erdman continued. "It was supposed to have 
enough power to rip the heck out of every living thing but leave the cars and 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
"But would it leave bodies, or just dissolve everything?" Shellen asked. 
</P>
<P>
Her teammates burst into laughter. "What a C-rate question, Chris. Are you 
blond or what?" Mike Johnson shouted over the ruckus. 
</P>
<P>
It continued on until 5:45 p.m. when Erdman packed up and left. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson encouraged the students to go home and study for their other classes. 
If they had any spare time, they should study for the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never-ending," Aaron said. "We have absolutely no free time." 
</P>
<P>
The team, which began studying for the competition in late August, will 
continue its grueling schedule as long as it is in the running for the national 
championship April 19-22 in Des Moines, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's Taft team maintained a similar schedule and are now faring better 
than most of their peers, studying at top colleges across the country, 
according to Arthur Berchin, who sponsored last year's national championship 
team. Several Taft team members attend Stanford, Harvard and University of 
California campuses. 
</P>
<P>
"It was worth it," Berchin said. "It is completely time consuming and it takes 
a lot of work, but there is a real thrill in winning that makes you forget the 
hours of studying. I believe they feel the same way over at El Camino Real. We 
do a lot of things in a similar style." 
</P>
<P>
The teams wear business clothes -- three-piece suits for the guys and dress 
suits for the girls -- at the competitions. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us a polished look and it makes us feel like we stand out among the 
others when we get to the competition," Shellen said. "We want the national 
title." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Johnson frowned as he listened to Shellen. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't count on it," Johnson said, shaking his head sadly. "We're going to 
lose. We're going to lose bad." 
</P>
<P>
What a comedian.

<P>
Fans of the L.A. Kings were typically treated each season to a free photo of 
the team, sponsored by Miller Lite. However, according to Rob Moor, the hockey 
team's vice president of marketing, "There are a number of upscale fans who 
want to express their allegiance to the Kings, but they're not about to put a 
Miller Lite poster in their home or office." 
</P>
<P>
To solve that problem, the Kings have taken the high road. They're turning to 
fine art. Sports artist Steve Holland of Santa Barbara was commissioned to 
create three lithographs -- called the Victory Suite -- and one will be 
released every year. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with L.A. Art, a Sherman Oaks gallery specializing in fine art 
with a sports theme, the Kings will present on March 10 the first 
limited-edition series of 100 autographed artist proofs at $495 a pop. The 
pieces are signed not only by the artist, but by the four team players who 
comprise the subject matter -- including the king of Kings, Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Gallery owner Shan Weaver notes that the Kings' move into fine art typifies a 
new trend for sports teams of all persuasions. "A lot of season ticket-holders 
for many teams are very wealthy and collect fine art," Weaver says. "So the 
teams are starting to go from memorabilia -- poster-ad look where it's 
illustration -- to a more sophisticated fine-art image, where the piece tells a 
story or shows the intensity and the discipline of the sport." 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Art represents artists who have been commissioned by the Chicago Cubs, the 
Raiders, Big 5 Sporting Goods and Santa Anita Golf Course, among others. 
Another tony L.A. team that prefers to remain nameless is commissioning a piece 
for its fans. 
</P>
<P>
Points of View 
</P>
<P>
"Our display windows are a little different than four mannequins with dresses 
slapped on them," says Scott Hill, general manager of Ron Ross Inc., a Tarzana 
clothing store for men and women. 
</P>
<P>
No fooling. 
</P>
<P>
The store is well-known for its highly original and thoughtful window displays. 
Last month the theme was the Berlin Wall, where mannequins posed against a 
colorful, crumbling wall, with graffiti such as "If not now, when." Paintings 
of onion-shaped Russian spires loomed in the background, and pieces of broken 
plaster casings were strewn around the mannequins' feet. 
</P>
<P>
It's a far cry from the palm trees and pastels found in most other retailers' 
windows. Tomorrow the windows change to a new theme: apartheid. "There will be 
a map of Africa, a portrait of Nelson Mandela, and a group of black mannequins 
in chains," promises the window's designer, Andrew Paul Binder of Drulu in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We're moving in a current events direction with our windows, and it just so 
happens that the last two big current events have been political situations," 
Hill says. "It isn't just tied into selling suits but an image as well. The 
customer who shops here looks for our shop to be different. We have 90 feet of 
windows and we try to put a little more energy and time into making a 
presentation to the community." 
</P>
<P>
Too Modern for Dogs 
</P>
<P>
Fire stations and Dalmatian dogs are as traditional a pair in our mind's eye as 
cats and hot tin roofs. But in Los Angeles you're more likely to see a cat on a 
hot tin roof than you are a Dalmatian at a fire station. 
</P>
<P>
"We're too modern to have dogs," says Manny Hernandez, public information 
officer for the Los Angeles City Fire Department. "If you wanted a dog, you'd 
have to get official permission -- put in the paper work. A station might have 
an occasional stray that hangs around for a while -- until someone has to start 
cleaning up after him, and then he's got to go." 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief Skip Bennett of the L.A. County Fire Department says: "In the 
old days, before motorized vehicles, Dalmatians used to run alongside the 
horses that pulled the pumpers. They'd chase the other dogs away from the 
horses and clear the streets. But now they've sort of gone by the wayside. It's 
not very usual for a fire station to have a dog." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, children's books on firefighters abound with pictures of 
Dalmatians perched atop red trucks. "We've never had one in the 21 years I've 
been here," says Battalion Chief Mike Davis of the Burbank Fire Department. 
"But still it's one of those traditional ideas that hangs on." 
</P>
<P>
How the Garden Grows 
</P>
<P>
For weekend gardeners, it's mecca time. March is when they start their 
pilgrimages to the nursery to spend more money than they originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
Flower gardens are especially popular with weekend gardeners because of their 
quick, colorful results. Jef Schmidt of Jef Schmidt Landscape Co. in Van Nuys 
has some advice before you start spreading newspapers across the back seat of 
your car. 
</P>
<P>
"It almost always takes more flowers than you think to make a nice garden," he 
says. "I like to mix in some more mature plants -- like four-inch pots of more 
slow-growing flowers -- with flowers that come in flats. That way you get some 
immediate color." 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt also recommends that you buy your plants from Valley nurseries, because 
those plants are already more acclimated to the weather here than those bought 
on the Westside, for example. 
</P>
<P>
And don't be afraid to experiment. "You can mix vegetables into your flower 
garden," he says. "Red Swiss chard -- it's almost a Burgundy color -- makes a 
great accent plant, or you could use bibb lettuce as a border around the flower 
bed." Herbs -- from parsley to basil -- are both pretty and practical in the 
flower bed, he says. 
</P>
<P>
While you're at the nursery, pick up some pre-planting fertilizer. "It costs a 
couple of extra dollars, but it protects your investment," Schmidt says. 
</P>
<P>
Overheard 
</P>
<P>
"Well, as I always say, you can't cheat at bowling." 
</P>

SYMPHONY PLANS CHANGES IN STYLE, NOT SUBSTANCE

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his opening season as the San Diego Symphony's music director, Yoav Talmi 
promises several innovations in format, but a minimum of innovative music. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi, who will conduct 10 of the 17 subscription programs on the orchestra's 
1990-91 winter season, disclosed programming details Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The season will include a new series of three chamber orchestra concerts in 
Symphony Hall, called Classically Baroque; two programs that will lead to the 
symphony's first recordings of classical repertory and a collaboration with the 
Old Globe Theatre in a concert that will juxtapose excerpts from Shakespeare's 
"Romeo and Juliet" with symphonic music by Berlioz, Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev 
inspired by the play. 
</P>
<P>
Talmi, who considers himself a Bruckner and Mahler specialist, will conduct 
Bruckner's Seventh Symphony (Nov. 30-Dec.2) as well as Mahler's Second Symphony 
"Resurrection" with the San Diego Master Chorale (April 5-7, 1991). 
</P>
<P>
For the American Pro Arte label, the orchestra will record a pair of CD's. The 
first will be a potpourri of J.S. Bach orchestral transcriptions (from the 
concerts on Feb. 14 and 16, 1991), and the second will contain works from the 
"Romeo and Juliet" collage (May 9 and 10, 1991). 
</P>
<P>
Principal guest conductor Robert Shaw will lead three subscription programs, 
including the Mozart "Great" Mass in C Minor with the Master Chorale (Jan. 
10-13), the first offering of the orchestra's yearlong tribute celebrating the 
bicentennial of Mozart's death. Talmi said nearly every subscription concert in 
1991 will contain at least one Mozart work and will be preceded by a half-hour 
program of Mozart's chamber music. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw will carry the brunt of American music programming, with two programs in 
March, 1991. The first will give the local premiere of John Harbison's 
"Remembering Gatsby," a commission from the Atlanta Symphony first performed in 
1986, and the second will be devoted to the music of Leonard Bernstein, 
including his "Chichester Psalms." 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra's 24-week schedule, expanded one week from the current season, 
will include four classic silent films accompanied by organist Dennis James and 
the orchestra, the popular Nickelodeon Series. Regular guest conductor Murry 
Sidlin will return four times to narrate and conduct the Classical Hits Series. 
</P>
<P>
The entertainment-oriented SuperPops Series has been renamed WinterPops; it 
will feature the return of Peter Schickele as P.D.Q. Bach (Feb. 1-2) and two 
other programs. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 5, Talmi will inaugurate the season with a program that pairs Brahms' 
First Symphony with Rachmaninoff's "Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini," with 
piano soloist Andre Watts. 
</P>
<P>
Though Talmi has previously expressed his commitment to contemporary music, the 
Israeli conductor has selected nothing more avant-garde than Samuel Barber's 
1941 Violin Concerto, which will feature violinist Zina Schiff (Oct. 11-12). He 
promised to compensate for this oversight in the 1991-92 season. Talmi's first 
encounter with the Master Chorale will be in the Faure Requiem (Oct. 19-21). 
</P>
<P>
Guest conductors include the return of German conductor Klauspeter Seibel (Oct. 
25-27) and the local debut of Polish maestro Kazimierz Kord. The Warsaw 
Philharmonic music director will lead Szymanowski's Nocturne from "Nocturne and 
Tarantella" and Shostakovich's Sixth Symphony. Assistant conductor of the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic Heiichiro Ohyama, who appeared with the symphony at last 
year's Symphony Tower opening gala concert, will conduct the third chamber 
orchestra program (Jan. 3). 
</P>
<P>
Among the soloists who will appear with the orchestra next season are pianist 
Jeffrey Kahane; cellist Lynn Harrell, who has been the orchestra's music 
adviser for the past two seasons; pianist Jose Carlos Cocarelli, silver 
medalist in the 1989 Van Cliburn Competition; prodigy Lelia Josefowicz, who 
performed last year with the SummerPops, and symphony principal clarinet David 
Peck.

CHEKHOV ALTERS PLAYHOUSE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lynn Redgrave will play Madame Ranevskaya in Chekhov's "The Cherry Orchard" at 
La Jolla Playhouse May 13 through June 17. 
</P>
<P>
The production will push the previously announced "Twelfth Night" from the 
season's opening slot to the closing spot, Oct. 14-Nov. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Playhouse artistic director Des McAnuff said he has been talking to director 
Tom Moore about working in La Jolla since 1984 -- and he has been talking to 
Redgrave 
</P>
<P>
since 1985. "The Cherry Orchard" was at the top of Moore's wish list, Redgrave 
was also interested, and schedules coincided in May. 
</P>
<P>
McAnuff believes a Russian play "that involves startling social changes" is 
especially appropriate now, as the Soviet Union goes through another round of 
such changes. But, although he and Moore have talked about the parallels 
between the two eras "in the abstract," McAnuff cautioned that they haven't 
discussed whether or how the parallels might become more specific on stage. 
</P>
<P>
This will be Moore's first full-fledged stage assignment since " 'night, 
Mother" at the Taper in 1986 (he directed L.A. Classic Theatre Works' live 
radio production of "Once in a Lifetime" in 1987). He has been working 
primarily in television.

BACK TO BASICS: FROM HEAD TO TAIL AND FIN TO FIN, SIX QUICK STEPS FOR BONING 
TROUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some supermarkets and stores specializing in fish choose to bone trout before 
selling it; however, many times the fish is marketed eviscerated, but with the 
skeleton still intact. It's relatively easy to remove these bones before 
cooking, making the fish easier to eat. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many species of fish, trout has thin skin and very small scales. 
Skinning or scaling, therefore, is really not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The first step is to rinse the fish under cold water. Place it on a clean work 
surface and using kitchen scissors, snip off the fins at their base (Step 1). 
</P>
<P>
With the trout lying on its side, remove the head by cutting just behind the 
gill covers (Step 2), using a strong, sharp knife. The spine is relatively 
soft, so it should not be difficult to cut through. 
</P>
<P>
Open the belly cavity and continue cutting it down to the tail (Step 3). The 
tail may be cut off, if desired. 
</P>
<P>
Use the scissors to cut through the fine rib bones on each side of the backbone 
(Step 4). Lift the backbone, scraping the flesh underneath and pull it free 
(Step 5). Cut or snip it off at the tail end. 
</P>
<P>
Remove the rib bones by sliding the knife underneath and gently lifting them 
off (Step 6). A final thorough rinsing under cold water and the trout is ready 
to cook.

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: LITTLE TRICKS CAN EASILY HELP MUFFINS MIX IN WITH A 
HEALTHY BREAKFAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As a healthful breakfast item, the muffin has received its share of criticism. 
That they are loaded with sugar or are high in saturated fat -- from butter and 
oil -- are two such grievances. 
</P>
<P>
But depending upon the recipe, an average muffin made from wholesome 
ingredients can contain 200 calories and five grams of fat or less. Combine 
this with fresh fruit and a serving of nonfat or low-fat milk and breakfast 
rounds out at fewer than 500 calories -- less than one-third of the day's 
allotment for a person on an 1,800 calorie per day diet. 
</P>
<P>
Ingredients such as nonfat milk, buttermilk and nonfat or low-fat yogurt can 
replace the whole dairy products usually called for in muffin recipes without 
ruining the texture of the final product. Whole grain cereal, such as oats, or 
wheat and oat brans can stand in nicely for some of the flour called for. Or, 
sprinkle wheat germ over the batter or substitute whole-wheat flour for half of 
the flour in the recipe. Tricks such as these improve the fiber content of 
muffins and up the total fiber for the day. 
</P>
<P>
The saturated fat and cholesterol contributed by eggs can be omitted with 
little notice by substituting two egg whites for each whole egg a recipe 
requires. This shaves off as much as 200 milligrams of cholesterol and six 
grams total fat from the day. 
</P>
<P>
Relying upon the natural sweetness of dried or fresh fruits is a suggestion for 
limiting the amount of sugar in muffins. And keeping an eye on cheese, meat and 
nuts in savory recipes will also spare calories and fat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

These are tough times for fresh fruit fanatics. Apples are on the wane, citrus, 
while in greater supply, is still too expensive, and imported peaches and plums 
seduce the winter-weary eye only to betray with one dry and tasteless bite. 
</P>
<P>
Bananas do not betray you, however; a lovely, evenly yellow skin will contain 
what you expect, fruit that's creamy and ripe. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a low-fat, cheesecake-like dessert that calls for the ever-dependable 
banana. This treat also can include the fresh strawberries that should be 
flooding the markets shortly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BANANA CHEESECAKE 
</P>
<P>
1 cup cottage cheese 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup plain yogurt 
</P>
<P>
2 medium bananas, mashed 
</P>
<P>
2 eggs, lightly beaten 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup sugar or honey 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest 
</P>
<P>
Sliced fresh strawberries, optional 
</P>
<P>
Process cottage cheese in blender or food processor until smooth, taking care 
not to liquefy. Add yogurt and blend until evenly combined. Add mashed banana 
and blend until smooth. Transfer to mixing bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Stir together eggs, sugar, vanilla and lemon zest in separate bowl. Beat into 
banana mixture until well combined. Pour mixture evenly into 6 (6-ounce) 
ramekins or custard cups. 
</P>
<P>
Place custard cups inside deep baking dish. Pour hot water 1/2 way up sides of 
ramekins. Bake at 375 degrees 40 minutes, checking often to maintain water 
level. Dessert is done when knife inserted in center comes out clean. 
</P>
<P>
Remove from oven and let cool at room temperature. Chill at least 3 hours 
before serving, topped with strawberries. Makes 6 servings.

<P>
EDUCATION: THE JAMES AND CAROL COLLINS CENTER FOR HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT, AN 
18,000-SQUARE-FOOT OPERATION ON THE CAL POLY CAMPUS IN POMONA, WAS FUNDED BY 
$3.5 MILLION.

<P>
Atop a hill on the campus of California Polytechnic Institute, Pomona, remote 
from the 21s and the Spagos of the world, a dream has unfolded aimed at 
creating the next Julia Child or Baron Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
The dedication Sunday of a handsome complex dedicated to restaurant and hotel 
management, to culinary arts and wine service, concludes a seven-year quest by 
food visionaries who have long felt that the West, creator of fast food trends 
that swept the nation, lacked a center dedicated to food, service and 
hospitality education. 
</P>
<P>
The James and Carol Collins Center for Hospitality Management was funded by 
$3.5 million in funds raised from donations and used no public funding. The 
18,000-square-foot facility instantly becomes the West Coast's most energetic 
such collegiate program. 
</P>
<P>
More than four dozen food and hospitality corporations donated $1,000 or more 
and dozens of other benefactors contributed smaller amounts to have the 
facility built to serve the 800 students now enrolled in Cal Poly's Hotel and 
Restaurant Management program, which began in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
However, it wasn't until a decade later that Collins met with Dr. Robert Small, 
director of the center, and other interested parties plans were made to raise 
the funds to build the center. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the building are some $200,000 in food preparation equipment, all 
donated by manufacturers. The equipment and the students are on view in a 
kitchen that is visible through a glass wall at the entrance to the restaurant 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the center to have a full-service, white tablecloth restaurant 
open to the public by September. Service will be Monday through Friday for 
lunch and Wednesday through Saturday for dinner. Wine and beer will be served; 
a full wet-bar will be on site, but used for laboratory purposes only. 
</P>
<P>
Also included in the facility is a demonstration kitchen and a $650,000 
research project sponsored by Southern California Edison to study energy use 
and efficiency in various food service appliances -- a project that gives the 
school sophisticated equipment and gives the public utility much-needed data on 
the performance and energy demands of new food service equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Tarun Kapoor, associate professor in the Center for Hospitality Management, 
said the hospitality program will make full use of the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a class in catering management, and we intend to run catered events, 
conducted by the students," he said. Also part of the program will be a hotel 
management program including courses in front office management; hotel 
operations, and hotel sales and public relations. 
</P>
<P>
Among four-year schools offering degrees in hospitality, Cornell University and 
Michigan State are considered the best schools in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, chairman of Collins Foods International, parent company of the Sizzler 
restaurants chain, donated $1 million to have the center constructed, and he 
spoke briefly at Sunday's bread-cutting ceremony (which replaced the 
traditional ribbon-cutting). 
</P>
<P>
"Fast food was started out West and has become successful around the country, 
and the only thing we didn't have was a world-class culinary center to compete 
with those in the east," said Collins. "Ten years from now, they're going to be 
talking about Cal Poly Pomona and then maybe about Cornell and Michigan State." 
</P>
<P>
Kapoor pointed out that Cornell and Michigan State have emphasized hotel 
management in their hospitality programs, "but because of California's 
trend-setting history in the food area, we have decided to specialize in food 
and wine." He said that a master's degree program in the department may someday 
be offered. 
</P>
<P>
Kapoor added that this undergraduate program was not intended to compete with 
programs such as those offered at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde 
Park, N.Y., or the California Culinary Academy in San Francisco, but might be a 
prelude to further study at those programs. 
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the center, for which fund-raising has already begun, will 
focus on the wine and alcoholic beverage management program. Phase 2, expected 
to cost about $3 million, already has a substantial grant from wine collector 
Elwell Averbeck. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for Phase 2 include a wine cellar, a living wine library and a major 
wine-tasting facility that could be home for the Los Angeles County Fair wine 
competition. A number of California wineries have already said they will donate 
wines to start the cellar. 
</P>
<P>
Architect for the center was John Tegtmeyer, a Cal Poly Pomona graduate who is 
with the architectural firm of Pederson, Beckhart, Wesley and Stice. 
</P>
<P>
Among the graduates of the hospitality program here are Mark Peel, owner/chef 
at Campanile; Sam Manolakas, owner of Bradshaw's restaurant in Sacramento, and 
Rick Redman, general manager of the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The program at present has 14 full-time instructors, but by September will have 
20 full-time instructors. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's dedication ceremonies featured food prepared by eight of Southern 
California's top chefs. Visitors toured classrooms, student study areas, 
instructors' offices, the beverage management lab, a computer lab and the 
demonstration hotel classroom. 
</P>
<P>
At Sunday's dedication, campus president Hugh O. La Bounty announced that the 
chairman and co-chairman of the center's advisory committee, respectively, 
would be Collins and Richard Frank, president and chief executive officer of 
Lawry's Restaurants Inc., for whom a lecture series at the center is named.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: THE FIRST CONVENIENCE ITEMS ARE CONSIDERED AS UP TO DATE 
AS 10 BC

These days, eating can seem like serious business, what with fretting about 
fiber and chafing over cholesterol. For a breather, step back in time. Test 
your knowledge of fascinating food facts and fancies with this quiz: 
</P>
<P>
Question: Convenience foods seem like a 20th-Century invention, but what were 
the first ones? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Fermented milk and cheese are often considered early convenience foods. 
On a more exotic note, more than 2,000 years ago the Chinese prized dried snake 
as a portable food for long trips, while Indians traveled with dried rice and 
dried bummelo fish, curiously labeled "Bombay duck." The Tibetan combination of 
yak butter and tea leaves also served well on trips. More recently, the 
portable staple for sailors was hardtack, made of flour and water, then baked 
rock-hard. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The modern eggplant looks nothing like an egg. How did it get its name? 
</P>
<P>
A: The only link we can find is shape, dating back to when eggplants were grown 
for decorative purposes. Actually, only Americans use that name, the British 
preferring the French word aubergine. That word can be traced to the Sanskrit, 
meaning "anti-wind" vegetable. Eggplant became a favorite of what might loosely 
be described as hippies and beautiful people in late 18th-Century France. 
Earlier it had been blamed falsely for causing epilepsy and fever. 
</P>
<P>
Q: At one time, tomatoes were considered poisonous fruit. How did that lore get 
started? 
</P>
<P>
A: Early botanists recognized the tomato, along with potatoes and eggplants, as 
members of the same family of poisonous plants as belladonna and black henbane. 
In 1544, Italian botanist Pierandrea Mattioli initially named the tomato mala 
aurea, meaning "golden apple" (the first ones to reach Europe were yellow), but 
later renamed it mala insana, or "unhealthy apple." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Oats have enjoyed a meteoric rise in reputation as a "health food." We 
associate them with Scotland, but where did oats originate? 
</P>
<P>
A: Oats, it appears, forced themselves on the world's diet. Perhaps having 
first taken root in northern Germany, they were already being eaten, possibly 
in wild form, in northern Europe in Neolithic times. By the Bronze Age, oats 
were under cultivation in central Europe. In ancient times, growing as weeds in 
high, cool altitudes, they choked out wheat, so farmers gave up and harvested 
them instead. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Numerous studies have explored the effects of coffee on health, but 
clear-cut links have yet to be found. In times past, coffee was valued for its 
special benefits. What were they? 
</P>
<P>
A: Coffee is said to have achieved its initial popularity among a religious 
sect known as dervishes, whose ritual included chanting and continuous whirling 
until participants slipped into a trance. Caffeine in the coffee may have 
prolonged the precataleptic state. Coffee originated in Ethiopia, but it's not 
known who first realized it was edible and drinkable. The word derives from 
both Turkish and Arabic roots meaning "wine." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Cocoa trees, native to South America, were probably brought to Europe by the 
crew of Columbus' fourth voyage. Cocoa was consumed as a beverage first, 
chocolate in block form came later. When was it first made into bars? 
</P>
<P>
A: For nearly 300 years after it was introduced in Europe, chocolate was 
consumed only in drinks. Chocolate bars appeared in Europe in the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Q: While olive oil has been a valued food since ancient times, it has other 
uses too. Can you name some of them? 
</P>
<P>
A: Before soap was invented, olive oil was used as a cleanser. In ancient 
Egypt, it may have been used as a lubricant to help move the huge blocks of 
stone forming the pyramids. The ancient Greeks and Hebrews applied it to the 
skin to bestow health and longevity. 
</P>
<P>
As a fuel, it was burned in earthenware lamps. The pulp remaining after the oil 
was pressed was used as animal feed and fertilizer. The Romans used the 
leftover liquid both as a weed killer and as insecticide on cabbage. Wood from 
olive trees was used for various purposes, notably the tabernacle of Solomon's 
temple. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Pasta's popularity has soared in recent years. Everyone knows the story that 
even though it's the keystone of Italian cooking, it was brought back from 
China by Marco Polo. But was it really? 
</P>
<P>
A: According to Reay Tannahill, author of "Food and History" (Crown Publishers: 
1988), that idea is a mistranslation of his having said that he "discovered" 
that the Chinese had pasta "which are like ours." The Italian pasta may date 
back to Etruscan times. If so, that would predate Chinese noodles by roughly 
500 years. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Tannahill's book, for more fun reading about food, try Waverly Root's 
"Food: An Authorized and Visual History"; Harold McGee's "On Food and Cooking: 
The Science and Lore of the Kitchen"; both Jane Grigson's "Vegetable Book" and 
"Fruit Book"; "Food in Chinese Culture" by K.C. Chang, and "Savoring the Past" 
by Barbara Wheaton. 
</P>
<P>
From Dickens to Modern Doctors: No One Is Exact About Dyspepsia 
</P>
<P>
Question: I've often wondered -- especially when reading old novels, where it 
seems to be a common affliction -- exactly what the term "dyspepsia" means. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You're not the only one. The name derives from two Greek words, dys, 
"bad," and pepsis, "digestion." Hence, bad digestion. That meaning is far too 
broad, since digestion covers everything from chewing to defecation. With 
dyspepsia, the focus is on the upper gastrointestinal tract and can include a 
laundry list of symptoms such as upper-abdominal pain or discomfort, unusual 
fullness after meals, feeling too full early in a meal, loss of appetite, 
belching, nausea and vomiting, and heartburn or regurgitation. 
</P>
<P>
That's why we say you're not the only one who's wondered how to define the 
condition. Attempting to reach a consensus, a group of physicians formed the 
"International Working Party on the Definition and Investigation of Dyspepsia" 
(some party). Here's their definition: "episodic or persistent abdominal 
symptoms, often related to feeding, which patients or physicians believe to be 
due to disorders of the proximal (upper) portion of the digestive tract." They 
suggest that it's a more useful term if accompanied by modifiers, as in "ulcer 
dyspepsia" or "nonulcer dyspepsia." 
</P>
<P>
Dyspeptic symptoms may be linked to structural problems of the gastrointestinal 
tract, use of drugs or alcohol, or metabolic diseases. With the possible 
exception of milk intolerance, it's rare to be able to prove objectively that a 
particular food is responsible for dyspepsia. 
</P>
<P>
Dyspepsia can also occur in individuals in whom no disease can be identified. 
This common problem is generally called functional dyspepsia. Did the 
dyspeptics of Dickens' novels suffer from functional disease, from extra-tight 
corsets, or from food-borne illnesses caused by foods poorly cooked and 
improperly stored? We'll never know for sure. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I had to go back to work soon after my son was born. I considered 
breast-feeding, but it was logistically impossible. My baby is healthy but 
sometimes fussy. My pediatrician says that's normal, but a friend who was 
visiting suggested I switch to iron-free formula. She claims that the addition 
of iron to formula can cause discomfort in some babies. Is that true? 
</P>
<P>
A: As a parent, you'll receive lots of free advice from friends, well-meant but 
not always accurate or helpful. 
</P>
<P>
The Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics found no 
scientific evidence that infants who consume iron-fortified formulas are more 
likely to suffer colic, constipation, diarrhea or regurgitation than those on 
nonfortified formula. The only difference observed, in one study where infants 
were fed both types of formula, were darker stools when the babies received the 
iron. That is of no importance. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also addressed another concern: that iron-fortified formula might 
interfere with absorption of zinc and copper. Again, they found no evidence 
that any impairment of absorption is nutritionally important, given the levels 
of both those minerals in the formula. 
</P>
<P>
According to the committee, by 1985, iron-fortified formula represented 80% of 
all formula sold in the United States, up from 40% in 1971. This trend is 
believed to be a major factor in the decline of anemia among infants in this 
country, among both low-income and middle-class populations. Their conclusion: 
Given the demonstrated benefit and lack of evidence for untoward effect, 
iron-fortified formula should be used for all formula-fed infants. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Oh bacon, bacon, I used to eat you often, but now, only on special 
occasions. My question is this: I know that in times past, cured meats were 
stored for long periods. But in that era, food safety was not well understood. 
Just how long is it safe to keep bacon? 
</P>
<P>
A: Begin by checking the package. As long as the bacon remains sealed in a 
vacuum package and looks well-colored, it should be just fine as much as a week 
after the last date of sale. Once opened, though, it should be wrapped tightly 
and kept no longer than a week. For longer storage it should be frozen, but not 
too long. After about a month the fat starts to turn rancid. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most efficient way to freeze bacon is to precook it until it's not 
quite done. Then drain it well, wrap it in paper towels, and then in heavy 
freezer material. It can then be stored in the freezer up to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
An important difference in curing methods allowed people in earlier days to 
keep cured meats over an entire winter. Today's cured meats, mildly cured and 
moist, generally are prepared for flavor rather than longevity. Those earlier 
meats were heavily salted and well dried, allowing them to keep through winter 
and beyond.

HINTS FROM HELOISE: READ LABELS TO KEEP A DIET HEALTHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR READERS: These days many people are cutting calories, fat, salt and 
cholesterol in the hope of maintaining health and diets. 
</P>
<P>
Did you know that butter and margarine both contain the same amount of fat? But 
butter is made from animal fat and contains cholesterol, while margarine, which 
is made from vegetable fat, doesn't have any cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
One of the easiest ways to limit intake of fat, salt and cholesterol is to 
carefully read all product labels before buying them. Eating fresh fruit and 
vegetables is also a great help. 
</P>
<P>
Salt substitutes are wonderful, but if you still crave the real thing, why not 
place half substitute and half real salt in the salt shaker. When refilling it, 
use less salt each time. Before you know it, you will be using substitute 
without any real effort. 
</P>
<P>
By following a few simple steps, nutritional needs will be met without a lot of 
hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I buy soda in 2- or 3-liter bottles. After I've finished about 
half of the bottle, the remaining soda tastes flat to me. I hated tossing it 
away, but wasn't sure what I could do with it. 
</P>
<P>
Finally I came up with a use. I pour this last bit of soda in an ice-cube tray 
and freeze it. Then I use the cubes in my soda. It doesn't get diluted as 
quickly and I save a few pennies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DIANE, El Paso, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: For years now I have made applesauce and passed out jars of it to 
friends and relatives. I was the hit of the neighborhood and my family. 
</P>
<P>
I have found a way to make it more appealing. When I use red-skinned apples, my 
favorites being Cortland or McIntosh, I leave the skins on and cook them and 
then press them through a sieve. This gives the applesauce an appealing pink 
shade. The applesauce looks pretty in the fancy little jars I put it in. 
</P>
<P>
 -- GRANNY, Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Saturday is usually cookie-baking day at my house. This is a time 
when my daughter and I spend time together while having fun baking. 
</P>
<P>
After preparing the dough and cutting the cookies out, we like to sprinkle on 
some colored sparkles or sugar crystals. This usually made a mess, so to make 
it easier I placed the cookie cutter around the cut-out cookies and then 
sprinkled on the decorations. This corralled the sprinkles and kept them from 
scattering all over the counter top. 
</P>
<P>
It made decorating and clean-up a snap. 
</P>
<P>
 -- KELLY G., Houston 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Instead of using adhesive-backed plastic shelf liner for lining 
kitchen shelves and cabinets (which never stays down and costs an arm and a 
leg), I buy prepasted, vinyl-coated bolts of wallpaper. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to work with and you can always find an inexpensive roll for less 
than $5. I've even bought them for as low as $1 on clearance. You get a lot 
more square footage per roll and the wallpaper doesn't turn up at the edges. 
You also have a greater variety of patterns from which to chose. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARCELA, Torrance 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: My family loves mashed potatoes, so it seems I make gravy for 
practically every meal. Gravy that is made from turkey or chicken doesn't have 
an appealing color, so I add about a tablespoon of low-salt soy sauce to give a 
richer color. We also get an added zing to the flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- KATHY, Cibolo, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: A while back you described a unique way to use a paint can to 
make a device to start the charcoal for a barbecue grill. I clipped the article 
with intentions of saving it but do not remember where I put it. I would like 
to try it because we use so much charcoal starter fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 -- SUSAN, Houston 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SUSAN: With the summer months fast approaching, I know you and many others 
will benefit from this hint. 
</P>
<P>
You will need a 1-gallon paint can with a wire handle. Wash and dry the can. 
Next, take the triangular end of a can opener and make about a dozen triangular 
openings around the outside bottom of the paint can. Then cut off the bottom 
with a manual can opener, making both ends open. You have now made the perfect 
accessory to help minimize the use of charcoal lighter when starting the 
barbecue fire. 
</P>
<P>
Place the can in the bottom of the barbecue pit and ball up about six 
half-sheets of newspaper and put them at the bottom of the can. Fill the rest 
of the can with charcoal. Using the holes in the bottom of the can, ignite the 
newspaper in several places. Because everything is contained in the can, there 
will be very little flame, just smoldering paper that will light the coals. 
This will take less time because of the chimney effect of the can. 
</P>
<P>
When the coals are good and hot, lift the can out of the grill by the wire 
handle. (Be sure to protect your hand and arms with a fireproof barbecue mitt 
and exercise caution when removing the hot can.) The can will cool quickly once 
removed from the grill and can be used over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I save empty cereal boxes and other food or household-item 
containers, such as cracker boxes and cans. I clean them and use them for 
playing "grocery" in my classes (I am an elementary-school speech therapist). I 
also cut out box fronts and make puzzles of them. My students love them, my 
trash pile is greatly reduced and it is much less expensive than store-bought 
food toys and puzzles (also more familiar). 
</P>
<P>
I even plan to do this when I have children of my own.

JAPANESE PIZZA WORTH THE EXPENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH A. BROWN, THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is it time to say sayonara to sushi, the emperor of Japanese foods in America? 
Perhaps not; but it may have some competition. 
</P>
<P>
Enter okonomiyaki (oh-koh-noh-mee-yah-kee), a pancake-type dough mixed and 
grilled with the customers' choice of vegetables, fish, meat and noodles. The 
dish is served with soy sauce, shaved fish and a sprinkling of seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
Here at Chibo, a new Japanese restaurant in mid-town Manhattan, customers sit 
around a central grill that sizzles and pops as expert chefs slice, dice, toss 
and turn this dish that is sometimes called Japanese pizza. True to 
Japanese-style cooking, each ingredient is cooked separately to preserve the 
flavor, until it's time to pour the flour-and-egg batter over the colorful 
mound of filling. 
</P>
<P>
I can attest that the restaurant's decor is authentic Japanese, with its pale 
pink walls, bare black chairs and lone gray branches casting shadows in the 
corners. Customers at the counter agree that the aroma from the hot grill and 
the ever-present crackling of what's to come make waiting difficult. So we 
sample appetizers: grilled noodles with fish and vegetables; miso or clear 
suimono soup; crispy greens tossed with ginger-sesame oil dressing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's delicious. Just like in Japan," says Tatsuo Sugai, a Tokyoite living in 
Manhattan. "And it's much cheaper than sushi." An okonomiyaki pancake, enough 
for one hearty appetite, costs less than $10 here; a meal of raw fish can run 
$30 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Two Japanese students seated at a table with a built-in grill agree that 
okonomiyaki is worth the trip uptown. Mayumi Kaneko says she always overcooked 
okonomiyaki in Niigata, her hometown north of Tokyo. She's glad they cook it 
just right here. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, okonomiyaki is popular in the Kansai district, and Chibo restaurant 
in New York is owned by and named for the famous okonomiyaki-ya (ya means shop) 
in Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
The pancake batter is quite versatile: it's also used in tai-yaki (fish-shaped 
cakes filled with sweet red bean paste), and tako-yaki (small balls filled with 
bits of octopus). Street vendors sell these foods everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can compare the taste to anything else," says Alex Kirzhnev 
from Leningrad, one of the few non-Japanese here. "It's a tasty combination of 
flavors. Very healthy." He and his wife plan to return. 
</P>
<P>
But what about the rest of New York? Will the No. 1 Japanese fast food catch on 
in America? 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Andoh, a cookbook author and executive director of the New York-based 
Associated Japan-America Societies Inc., is doubtful. The dish is so different 
from what Americans are used to, she says. It might require "teaching them what 
to like." 
</P>
<P>
Although the restaurant might serve some curious customers, most foreign foods 
are slow to catch on, she says. "There are a lot of people going out of their 
way to try new things, but I don't see McDonald's offering 'mcsushi.' " 
</P>
<P>
Andoh says new foods must be introduced slowly, and the restaurateurs have to 
be shrewd (and patient) marketers. She recommends good advertising, a catchy 
approach (like cooking in front of customers), and high enough prices to cover 
the exorbitant retail rents here -- $10 is not enough, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Akemi Tanno is editor of the U.S. Food Journal, a trade journal on American 
foods published for the Japanese food industry. He is more optimistic about 
domestic tastes. "American people who are familiar with Japanese food seem to 
be interested in new and exotic food. . . . They're not satisfied with just 
traditional Japanese food -- sushi, tempura, sukiyaki," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Gary Goldberg, executive director of culinary arts at the New School 
in New York, toured Japan and singled out okonomiyaki as a candidate for 
American palates: "It's convenient, cheap, relatively nourishing, and it's a 
whole meal on the plate." 
</P>
<P>
But it won't sweep America, he says. "It needs a sophisticated market, almost a 
college market" of adventurous appetites willing to try new, inexpensive foods. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile back at the restaurant, green tea is served as Japanese waitresses 
whisk away the empty platters. As the guests leave, a typical Japanese chorus 
of domo arigato gozaimasu (thank you very much) follows the guests out into the 
neon night.

CULVER CITY TOOK SHAPE IN ODD WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some old-timers still call it the dog track. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-acre site of the proposed Marina Place regional shopping center in 
Culver City, perched at the tip of Culver City's long western tentacle, has had 
a colorful history. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1900s, wheeler-dealer developer Harry Culver, after whom the city 
is named, bought chunks of unincorporated land, including the Marina Place lot, 
as they became available. It was his acquisitive strategy that helped give 
Culver City its peculiar shape. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept buying little parcels," said Syd Kronenthal, Culver City's director of 
human services and parks. 
</P>
<P>
Kronenthal said he believes it was Culver's goal to extend his domain as close 
to the ocean as he could. "He fell short of that," ending up just east of 
Lincoln Boulevard, Kronenthal noted. 
</P>
<P>
Culver's immediate incentive for his western expansion was the development of 
Venice as a resort modeled after its Italian namesake, complete with canals and 
gondolas. He bought the 300-foot-wide corridor that runs along Washington 
Boulevard, which had been an old wagon trail, figuring that businesses on the 
strip would service and "line the way" to the beach community, said 
third-generation Culver City resident Julie Lugo Cerra. 
</P>
<P>
In 1926, the Culver City Council annexed 484 acres of unincorporated county 
land, including the Marina Place site and the Washington Boulevard corridor 
connecting with the rest of Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
There is some debate among longtime residents whether the Marina Place site was 
annexed for the express purpose of establishing a greyhound racing track, but 
the track did open soon after the parcel was made part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Parimutuel betting was illegal, so instead race patrons would buy "stock" in a 
dog and cash in on their stock afterward. The greyhound stadium thrived for a 
couple of years, only to be closed by a statewide ban on dog racing. 
</P>
<P>
The greyhound races were replaced by midget auto races, but not for long -- 
competition from race tracks in Saugus and Gardena and complaints about the 
noise from neighbors brought the midget cars to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
Rising next in the stadium was "Auction City," a giant swap meet. Sam Cerra, 
Culver City's engineering services supervisor and a longtime resident, said the 
auction featured "the same kind of people selling the same kind of junk" as one 
finds on cable television stations nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas Co. bought the property, tore down the stadium and erected 
hangars in 1956. More than 4,500 people reported to work there. The site later 
became a Hughes Helicopter factory. 
</P>
<P>
Prudential Insurance Co. bought the lot in 1980, letting the Los Angeles 
Olympic Organizing Committee use the hangars as a headquarters in 1984. The 
buildings housed weekend swap meets as recently as a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The city Planning Department calls it the "Prudential site." More people call 
it "Marina Place." But to those who can remember the old days, it's still the 
dog track.

Although the district attorney's office declined last week to file charges 
against five Gold Security Patrol employees involved in the incident, city 
directors unanimously approved requesting further investigation by the district 
attorney's office, the county grand jury, the state attorney general and 
federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city will request that the state Department of Consumer 
Affairs investigate the security company to determine whether it should be 
fined or lose its license. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an opportunity to face one of the deepest social cleavages in our 
community today," Director Rick Cole said, referring to the unrest that 
Holloway's death has sparked among many of the city's black residents. 
</P>
<P>
The death also sparked calls for changes in Pasadena Police Department 
practices, although its officers were not accused of any wrongdoing in 
connection with the incident. 
</P>
<P>
But the board stopped short of banning police use of the carotid control hold, 
as some black activists had requested. Acting Pasadena Police Chief Bruce 
Philpott told the board that no deaths have occurred at police hands as a 
result the hold since 1981 and that no complaints about the hold were lodged 
with the department last year. 
</P>
<P>
The carotid hold is used hundreds of times each year by Pasadena officers to 
subdue combative people, Philpott said. It is applied in three levels of 
increasing force. He said the third level, which renders a person unconscious, 
was not used at all last year. 
</P>
<P>
He also credited the hold with saving his own life in an alley fight while on 
duty in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very little other options available to an officer who is fighting a 
combative subject who doesn't want to be taken into custody," Philpott said. 
</P>
<P>
The board also took no action to limit the police practice of requiring some 
individuals stopped by police to sit on the curb or lie prone on the ground. 
However, the board directed Philpott to meet with community activist Eugene 
Pickett about the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Pickett and other black community representatives said Tuesday that Pasadena 
police use the practice more frequently in dealing with blacks than whites. 
They also said young black males find the practice demeaning and will resist in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact of the matter is, I don't see white people on the ground being 
demoralized. I see black people," a young black man, who identified himself as 
J. C., told the board. "If you treat us like animals, we're going to act like 
caged animals, violently." 
</P>
<P>
The board also asked city staff to prepare a report on the use of Nation of 
Islam members as security guards in housing projects. Members of the religious 
order have asked to replace Gold Security Patrol at the 313-unit housing 
complex along Fair Oaks Avenue. However, the complex is privately owned by 
Goldrich, Kest &amp; Associates, which hires the security company, and the 
board has no standing in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's actions arose from recommendations made by Directors John Crowley and 
Chris Holden, who met Friday with about 40 residents of the city's 
predominantly minority Northwest section, where King's Villages is located. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants have for some time been troubled by conditions at the complex and have 
blamed management practices, but Holloway's death and subsequent community 
protest forced the board to take action. 
</P>
<P>
Holloway, 28, well-known and liked in the Northwest area, was stopped for 
allegedly trespassing at the complex Jan. 18, and refused to leave. He 
struggled with four security guards and a security dispatcher, who chased him 
off the property and wrestled him to the ground. When police were summoned, 
they noticed that Holloway had stopped breathing. He was taken to Huntington 
Memorial Hospital, where he died about 1 1/2 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office determined that Holloway's blood alcohol level was 0.17% 
and that he died of "compression of the neck." However, the district attorney's 
office declined to file charges against the dispatcher, Steve Goldbaum, who 
allegedly administered the neck hold, after determining that Goldbaum held an 
expired security guard license. 
</P>
<P>
Because that gave him the status of a private citizen, not a trained guard, he 
could not be legally held responsible for Holloway's death, the district 
attorney reasoned.

PASADENA BOARD TO ASK FOR PAY OF $935 A MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Board of Directors decided Tuesday to ask voters to raise their 
pay to $935 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The board unanimously approved placing the proposal for the pay hike on the 
June 5 ballot, but in the belief that voters might reject larger amounts, 
cautiously chose to peg it at $935. The amount is equivalent in 1990 dollars to 
the $250 monthly pay set in 1968, according to calculations by city staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot proposition will also ask voters to tie city director salaries to 
the consumer price index so that raises will be automatically increased as the 
cost of living rises. If approved by the voters, the increase would take effect 
July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't view this as a pay raise for me," said Director Rick Cole. "I'm really 
concerned about the citizens." Because board members receive $50 per meeting to 
a maximum of $250 monthly, residents must choose among candidates who are 
"retired, wealthy or overworked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed raise was supported by Pasadena Citizens for Representative 
Government. Attorney Dale Gronemeier, a member of that group, suggested an even 
larger raise, to $3,000 per month, an amount the board perceived as 
unacceptable to voters. 
</P>
<P>
"To talk in terms of $3,000 would be a distinct uphill climb to be acceptable," 
said Mayor William Thomson. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Lamb, a resident who opposes the aerial spraying of malathion, also 
spoke in favor of the raise. She said the board's actions last week -- when it 
passed an ordinance banning low-altitude flights above the city and sent a city 
police helicopter into the air to enforce it -- have boosted the board's 
popularity, which could result in easy passage of the pay measure. 
</P>
<P>
Increases in board pay were unsuccessfully proposed in 1988 after nearly three 
years of review by a city-appointed Charter Study Committee. But that proposed 
increase, to $1,200 a month, was tied to creation of an at-large elected mayor 
with a salary twice that of the other board members. The mayor now is elected 
from among the seven board members. 
</P>
<P>
To simplify the current ballot proposal and ensure its success, the board 
members avoided tying the pay hike to any other proposal, such as one 
suggestion, rejected Tuesday, to increase the mayor's salary by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Although Thomson acknowledged that hours for the mayor's job are longer than 
those of the other board members, he said a proposal to increase the salary 
would be perceived as the first step toward creation of a strong-mayor form of 
government, an idea rejected by the voters in 1988.

HUSBAND TOLD HER HE SHOT GUARD, WIFE TESTIFIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite complaining that she felt "nauseated" by a prosecutor's questions, the 
wife of a man accused of robbing and shooting an armored car guard reluctantly 
testified last week that her husband told her how he committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Kimberly Giordano, however, also retracted some of the incriminating testimony 
that she gave in the first trial of her husband, Alfred Giordano, and implied 
that she had been pressured and coerced by police investigators to testify 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
"There are things done when you're not on the stand, then they get you on the 
stand and say, 'Oh, what happened?' " Kimberly Giordano, 28, said Monday in 
Pasadena Superior Court, referring to police investigators and prosecutors, 
after two days on the witness stand. "It makes you want to spit on them." 
</P>
<P>
Her testimony came during the second trial of Alfred Giordano, 27, who is 
accused of shooting security guard Howard White on Dec. 31, 1987, outside a 
check-cashing business on San Fernando Road in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Giordano's 33-year-old brother, Peter Giordano, was accused of driving the 
getaway car in the incident, which left White, now 34, paralyzed from the waist 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Both Giordano brothers were charged with attempted murder and attempted 
robbery. But in a trial last May, Peter was acquitted and a mistrial was 
declared on the charges against Alfred after jurors deadlocked 11 to 1 in favor 
of conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Since the second trial began Feb. 15, Deputy Dist. Atty. Jo Ann B. Glidden has 
presented eyewitnesses who testified that they saw Alfred Giordano shoot White, 
search the canvas bag the guard was carrying, then flee after finding it empty. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Glidden, Kimberly Giordano, her chin resting in her hand 
and her eyes cast downward, reluctantly corroborated some of her testimony from 
the preliminary hearing and the first trial: that shortly after the robbery 
attempt, during an argument, her husband told her that he shot the guard and 
described to her what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
But in contrast to earlier testimony, she said she did not see Alfred Giordano 
bury in her back yard the machine gun he allegedly used. She also denied seeing 
him try to alter the appearance of Peter Giordano's Chevrolet Nova, which 
witnesses have identified as the car that was used in the getaway. 
</P>
<P>
Kimberly Giordano told Glidden that she could remember few details about 
conversations with her husband after the robbery and at times offered sarcastic 
and flip answers in response to the prosecutor's questions. 
</P>
<P>
The witness also testified that she had had a sexual relationship with the main 
investigator in the case, Glendale Police Officer Joseph Jimenez, and that he 
helped her receive advance reward money for testifying against her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez in the past admitted that he arranged the payments but has denied 
allegations of a sexual relationship. 
</P>
<P>
When his sobbing wife left the courtroom last week after a day of testimony, 
Alfred Giordano broke into a broad grin and applauded. The jury already had 
stepped out. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say this has been easy," Glidden said Tuesday. "We would have 
preferred that she not waffle back and forth, but I believe the substance was 
clear." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Robert Swanson said he believed that Kimberly Giordano's 
testimony and behavior showed that she had been pressured into testifying 
against her husband, and that her recounting of his alleged confession was not 
credible. He said she had been "fed" information from Jimenez and others and 
had mistaken it as her own observations. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you separate fact from fiction in this case?" Swanson repeatedly asked her 
in cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything that's happened -- no, I can't," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson told jurors last week that Alfred Giordano was in Orange County at the 
time of the shooting. It was Peter Giordano, Swanson has contended, who gunned 
down the security guard. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Lawrence Davis, a nurse at Lake Memorial Hospital, testified that 
in late 1987 he gave Alfred Giordano a semiautomatic machine gun because Davis' 
girlfriend demanded that he remove the gun from her house. 
</P>
<P>
And Jesus Alvarez, a Mexican immigrant, testified that three or four days after 
the attempted robbery, Alfred Giordano asked him to paint Peter Giordano's car, 
the vehicle allegedly used in the crime.

IRATE POLICE PICKET BUT ALSO RESUME TALKS; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: SOME OFFICERS THREATEN JOB ACTIONS OVER THE CITY'S MOVE TO ENFORCE 
PROVISIONS OF ITS LAST CONTRACT OFFER.

<P>
The police union intensified its labor offensive on city management this week 
with picketing and talk of job actions, but also resumed the on-again, 
off-again contract negotiations with officials. 
</P>
<P>
Furious that the city has started to enforce provisions of its last formal 
contract offer, union leaders said they would fight back on a variety of 
fronts. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just the kickoff," union President Mike Tracy said Tuesday night as he 
stood in the midst of off-duty police officers picketing the weekly City 
Council meeting with signs bearing such slogans as: "I didn't know I worked in 
Russia." 
</P>
<P>
Union Vice President Terry Holland said it was "highly probable" that police 
officers would take some sort of job action, although city officials were 
unable to confirm reports that officers were cutting back on the number of 
traffic tickets they write. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not just going to sit here and agree to a city-imposed contract on us," 
Holland said. "The membership is very angry." 
</P>
<P>
Although each side blamed the other for failure to end the nearly yearlong 
labor dispute, talks between city and union officials were revived Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very productive and we're moving along," city Human Resources Director 
William Storey said Wednesday, adding that both sides were working on their 
positions and would continue meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago both sides were predicting a settlement was near. But the 
negotiating sessions collapsed when the city charged the union with changing 
its position on a key contract point. At the same time, the city won permission 
from an appeals court to begin implementing new work rules in the city's last 
formal contract offer, made in October. 
</P>
<P>
The city last fall declared an impasse in the negotiations and unilaterally 
adopted provisions of its last contract offer without the consent of the union. 
A Superior Court judge upheld the city's right to impose the new personnel 
policies on the 620-member Long Beach Police Officers Assn. The union has 
appealed the ruling, but the 2nd District Court of Appeal refused to stop the 
city from enforcing the new provisions until the court rules in the case. 
Attorneys said they expect it will be months before a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the department is not rushing to adopt the new personnel 
practices. "We're going to move real slowly and try to work cooperatively," 
Police Chief Lawrence Binkley said in an interview Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The union members do not appear in a cooperative mood. The police 
administration has been hoping for volunteers to help make the change from 
two-officer cars to one-officer cars at night, and to switch from four-day work 
weeks to five-day work weeks in return for more pay. But Binkley said Tuesday 
night that only three officers had volunteered to staff one-officer cars, and 
they had subsequently withdrawn their offers. Binkley said no officers have 
been assigned to the one-officer cars or the five-day weeks, both of which are 
major points of contention in the labor fight. 
</P>
<P>
The department's administration has ordered Tracy, the union president, back to 
regular police duties. Under the old contract, the union president was kept on 
the department payroll but allowed to work full time on union business. The new 
work rules abolish that provision and Tracy reported to the chief's office 
Monday morning, a trim mustache and virtual crew cut replacing the long-hair 
look he has favored. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials emerged from a meeting early this week with plans, as Holland 
put it, to "stir up some public support." They said they would picket City 
Council meetings and perhaps the homes of council members and city management. 
Union members intend to walk the First and Fifth City Council districts this 
weekend to urge residents to vote against the council incumbents, who are 
running for reelection this spring. 
</P>
<P>
The union is also endorsing challengers to Evan Anderson Braude, the First 
District incumbent, and Les Robbins, the Fifth District incumbent, and is 
asking other unions to withhold financial support from incumbents up for 
reelection.

COUNCIL MOVES TOWARD BAN ON HILLSIDE HOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council took a first step Tuesday toward an 18-month ban on 
hillside housing subdivisions to allow city planners time to draft new rules 
for such projects. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 to introduce a hillside moratorium ordinance, with a 
final vote scheduled on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard Jutras cast the dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
"Continued development of our hillside can have irreversible consequences of 
the loss of open space and recreational space for current and future citizens 
if regulations on development during an interim period are not enacted," 
Planning Director John W. McKenna said in a written report to the council. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium would affect any subdivision plan that includes more than four 
houses. The council excluded plans for four hillside subdivisions, involving 
about 100 houses, that were already being processed by city planners. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jerold F. Milner said up to 1,500 new single-family houses could be built 
on Glendale's hillside. Unless new restrictions are imposed covering matters 
such as grading and design, the next large hillside housing proposal could 
trigger a major public outcry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some developers who own hillside land object to the proposed moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm displeased," John Gregg, president of Gregg Development, said Wednesday. 
"I think it's not only unfortunate, but it's detrimental to the interests of 
Glendale. The city has been outspoken about the need for more single-family 
homes. The only place to put those in Glendale is on the hillside." 
</P>
<P>
Planning consultant Marlene Roth, who represents three hillside developers 
excluded from the proposed moratorium, acknowledged that the city needs to 
update its plan for open-space preservation. But she added, "Philosophically, I 
have a concern. Why does it take 18 months to do that, and is it fair? My hope 
is that the study can be done in less time."

APPROVAL FOR MARINA PLACE MALL EXPECTED; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: MILLIONS IN SALES-TAX REVENUE FOR CULVER CITY ARE AT STAKE. 
OPPONENTS SAY THE PROJECT'S LOCATION WILL STRANGLE TRAFFIC IN THE ALREADY 
CONGESTED AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hungry for millions of dollars in sales-tax revenue, the Culver City Council is 
expected to give final approval Monday to construction of the controversial 
Marina Place shopping center despite its potential for snarling traffic as far 
away as Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed $159-million Mediterranean-style regional shopping mall has 
generated intense opposition from neighbors in Los Angeles who fear the already 
congested residential and commercial area near Marina del Rey and Venice will 
be strangled by traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents note that the shopping center's location -- a site nearly surrounded 
by Los Angeles at the western tip of a skinny, two-mile-long finger of Culver 
City -- ensures that while Culver City reaps the financial benefits, the brunt 
of the traffic the project generates would fall almost entirely on Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
To draw attention to the project's potential impacts, Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley joined Councilwoman Ruth Galanter at a demonstration Sunday in front of 
the fenced, 18-acre former industrial site where Marina Place would be built. 
The property lies just east of heavily traveled Lincoln Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 protesters of all ages carried signs and marched back and forth 
across busy Washington Boulevard at Walnut and Glencoe Avenues to show how 
traffic would be snarled by the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to play dodge ball, not dodge car!" said one sign carried by a 
youngster. 
</P>
<P>
The 1-million-square-foot project, a joint venture of Prudential Insurance Co. 
and Marina Simon Associates, is nearly 50% larger than the Westside Pavilion 
shopping center, which has drawn the wrath of its West Los Angeles neighbors 
because of heavy traffic. 
</P>
<P>
A revised environmental impact report concludes that Marina Place -- with a 
Nordstrom and Bullock's store, other shops, restaurants, and a six-screen movie 
theater -- will generate massive amounts of traffic and contribute to 
near-gridlock conditions at peak hours weekdays and weekends as far away as 
Santa Monica. Air quality, the reports says, will also deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Marina Place will generate 31,000 vehicle trips on a 
typical weekday. On Saturdays, the shopping center will draw 40,030 trips. And 
daily traffic volumes are expected to be 42% greater during the Christmas 
shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, even with extensive improvements to roadways, intersections and signals, 
traffic from the mall, when combined with the already heavy traffic in the 
area, is expected to clog 16 intersections at peak hours on weekdays and 13 
intersections on weekends. Some of the the affected intersections are several 
miles away, as far north as the Santa Monica Freeway and as far east as the San 
Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental impact report also notes that "fire and emergency 
medical/rescue response to the (Marina Place) site may also be delayed by 
traffic congestion due to project-related traffic." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the traffic issue, the environmental impact statement makes 
clear that "the proposed project could cause and contribute to significant air 
quality impacts," including violation of federal and state standards for carbon 
monoxide at several nearby intersections. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter, whose Venice residence is less than a mile from the Marina Place 
site, has accused Culver City of supporting the project because it will benefit 
that city's treasury "at the expense of Los Angeles residents and all others 
who must traverse the area's streets and breathe its air." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Culver City officials, Galanter said that the increased carbon 
monoxide levels would represent "a clear danger to the health and well-being of 
my constituents and yours." 
</P>
<P>
Culver City Mayor Jozelle Smith takes a decidedly different view. "I don't 
think this project is creating that much negative automobile traffic and air 
pollution," she said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who has said she looks forward to shopping at Marina Place, predicted 
that the project will win approval next week. "I certainly feel confident that 
we will proceed with it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor noted the economic benefits to Culver City. "This will provide us a 
couple million dollars a year in sales-tax revenue that will certainly allow us 
to upgrade our city's quality of life," she said. "I feel very positive about 
the project." 
</P>
<P>
Smith expressed surprise at last weekend's demonstration against Marina Place. 
"I don't know why there is this fervor," she said, suggesting that perhaps the 
opposition was due to the presence of "a lot of community activists" in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Gourley, one of two slow-growth members of the Culver City Council, 
expressed reservations about the shopping mall. "I can't see burdening this 
area with 40,000 cars a day," he said in an interview. "Because Los Angeles has 
always done it to us is not a valid reason for us to do it to them." 
</P>
<P>
Gourley acknowledged, however, that the "perceived prestige" of having a 
Nordstrom store and "an unending stream of revenue" from the mall are hard for 
a small city to resist. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of the Marina Place project appears likely to bring the long-simmering 
battle between Los Angeles and Culver City to a boil. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles and the Venice Town Council filed suit against Culver City after 
the first phase of the project won preliminary approval in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Superior Court Judge Kurt J. Lewin last October, barred Culver 
City from granting any further approvals for Marina Place unless a new 
environmental impact report was prepared and the City Council certified that 
the new report complies with the California Environmental Quality Act. 
</P>
<P>
The act, the state's pre-eminent environmental law, requires developers to 
identify and offset all significant environmental impacts associated with a 
large project. 
</P>
<P>
But the law also allows a city to find an "overriding consideration," such as 
the economic benefit of the project, and allow it to be built even if its 
environmental impacts cannot be mitigated. Culver City Deputy Planner Carol 
DeLay said Wednesday that the city planned to invoke this provision in order to 
proceed with Marina Place. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter has said the revised environmental impact report is not adequate 
because it fails to address the traffic and air quality effects of the project, 
and aggravates an imbalance between the number of jobs and housing units on the 
Westside. Los Angeles officials have threatened to file another suit against 
Culver City if the project is allowed to proceed. Debra L. Bowen, attorney for 
the Venice Town Council, predicted that the issue ultimately will end up in 
court again. 
</P>
<P>
Bowen said Culver City has failed to adequately consider alternatives to the 
proposed shopping mall such as a residential development that would generate 
far less traffic. "Traffic and air quality issues go hand in hand with the 
general issues of land use," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In a high-stakes bid to block the project, Los Angeles may refuse to issue 
permits needed to construct traffic improvements on its streets in the vicinity 
of Marina Place. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Planner DeLay said Culver City recognizes that "Los Angeles may not 
be willing to allow some or all of the improvements to take place." 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating just such a circumstance, she said Culver City may provide for 
issuance of an occupancy permit for the shopping mall without Los Angeles' 
traffic improvements if the developer makes "all good faith and reasonable 
efforts" to obtain the needed permits. 
</P>
<P>
The project is the fifth proposed for the property since Prudential acquired 
the land in 1980. Until recently, the property housed the Marina Indoor Swap 
Meet.

NOLAN FACES HIS TOUGHEST ELECTION RACE; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: CAPITOL CORRUPTION PROBE HAS LEFT THE GLENDALE REPUBLICAN UNDER 
A CLOUD THAT MAY GIVE A DEMOCRATIC RIVAL A CHANCE TO UNSEAT THE ASSEMBLY 
VETERAN.

<P>
Facing his most difficult election in 12 years, Glendale Republican Pat Nolan 
kicked off his campaign for a seventh term in the Assembly last week with a 
rousing endorsement from Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing 600 Nolan supporters at a $150 per person reception in Pasadena, 
Deukmejian praised the former Republican Assembly leader as a close personal 
friend and key player in his administration. 
</P>
<P>
"While I'm not going to be there next year and the years after, I sure will be 
able to sleep better if I know that Pat's going to be reelected," Deukmejian 
told a cheering crowd at the Doubletree Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The staunchly conservative Nolan, 39, has easily carried the heavily Republican 
41st Assembly District, which includes Glendale, Eagle Rock, a large part of 
Pasadena and Altadena since winning it in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
However, he now faces uncertainty as a result of being named in an FBI 
investigation into corruption in the Legislature. Though Nolan has neither been 
charged nor indicted, he remains a target for prosecution, according to sources 
close to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan has no Republican challenger in the June 5 primary election, but could 
face harsh attack from a seasoned Democrat in the November final. 
</P>
<P>
Vying for the Democratic nomination in June are Jeanette Mann, a trustee for 
the Pasadena Community College District, and Rod McKenzie, professor of 
Geography at USC. Peace and Freedom candidate David Velasquez is not opposed. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, 53, said she plans to hit Nolan hard on ethics. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Mr. Nolan will be indicted," she said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Mann appears to have the jump on McKenzie, 52, who characterizes 
himself as "just a classic academician." 
</P>
<P>
But McKenzie said he hoped to appeal more widely to voters than Mann, because 
of her liberal posture. He said he will refrain from talking about possible 
prosecution of Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
"My presumption is that until he has been proven guilty, the man is innocent," 
McKenzie said. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that Nolan's status in the investigation will not be resolved 
until after the November election, rendering it an inevitable question during 
the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan remains a target of the federal political corruption investigation that 
surfaced in August, 1988, when his Capitol office was raided by FBI agents. The 
investigation, which included an elaborate sting operation, led to the 
indictment of Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), who was convicted in 
February of seven counts of extortion, racketeering and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
Among the key pieces of evidence that emerged during Montoya's trial was that 
Nolan, then the Assembly Republican Leader, was arranging with Senate staffer 
John Shahabian, a government informant, to receive campaign contributions from 
a dummy shrimp company set up by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Also, last November a former top Nolan aide, Karin Watson, pleaded guilty in 
U.S. District Court to extorting $12,500 for Republican lawmakers in exchange 
for help in passing a bill to benefit the bogus shrimp company. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Nolan, four other elected officials were targeted in the same 
undercover sting operation that led to Montoya's indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan has said he did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has accused me of doing anything," Nolan said in an interview this 
week. "I say when the investigation is concluded, I think I'll be completely 
exonerated." 
</P>
<P>
But the probe, coupled with Republican setbacks in the 1988 elections, led to 
Nolan losing his position of GOP Assembly leader. That position gave Nolan a 
statewide profile and took him all around California as a spokesman for his 
party. "I had to be from one end of the state to another," Nolan acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Though winning his own district again easily in 1988, Nolan suffered a 
discernible erosion of his margin of victory two years earlier. In his second 
run at Nolan, Democrat John Vollbrecht increased his vote tally more than 50% 
from just under 30,000 to more than 45,000, while Nolan added only about 3,000 
votes to 69,508 in a presidential election year when more voters traditionally 
go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
One source close to Nolan, who asked not to be identified, said that the 
assemblyman was buoyed by the outcome of a recent special Senate election in 
which Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier), also a target of the FBI 
investigation, won the GOP nomination. The success of Hill, the source said, 
"confirmed Pat's belief that things aren't that bad." 
</P>
<P>
Some of his colleagues say that veteran lawmaker Nolan, faced with the federal 
probe, is acting more like a freshman lawmaker popping up at a variety of 
events in his district, sometimes several in a day. Now, relieved of his 
statewide duties, which included fund raising for other candidates, Nolan said 
he "can spend that time in the district." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, since he lost his leadership post, Nolan has been involved in more 
issues that are popular with leaders in his district -- pushing for legislation 
to block parole offices near homes, toughen the penalties for auto theft and 
equalize state funding for school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan acknowledged that his district is becoming more ethnically diverse with 
an influx of Latinos, Armenians and Koreans, diluting his primary power base of 
conservative, middle-income whites. And he noted that Democrat Michael Dukakis 
carried Pasadena in the last presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
But Nolan said that his constituents continue to like his brand of conservative 
politics. "I feel that people feel that I've been a good solid representative," 
Nolan said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian played on that sentiment in his endorsement last week, praising 
Nolan's contributions to the Republican agenda of the '80s: holding down the 
budget, building the economy and getting tough on crime. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat has had a very vital role in ensuring that we have been able to have a 
balanced budgets each year," Deukmejian said. 
</P>
<P>
"What I like about Pat . . . is that he states his beliefs, he has strong 
conviction, he's not wishy-washy, he pursues those goals. He sticks to his 
principals. He's committed. And, he is very persuasive and effective. . . . He 
articulates his common sense philosophy and that's been instrumental in 
engineering in California a transformation that we have seen." 
</P>
<P>
Among Democratic party operatives, there is disagreement over whether Nolan has 
become vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Floyd (D-Carson), who explored the possibility of recalling 
Nolan about two years ago, asserted that Nolan's conservative record is not in 
tune with the state's voters. Floyd remains angry about Nolan's alleged 
involvement in the preparation of phony presidential endorsement letters mailed 
on behalf of Floyd's GOP opponent in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But other Democrats acknowledge that would be difficult to unseat Nolan, unless 
he is indicted in connection with the federal investigation before the November 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
With the investigation "over his head," Nolan must go out and talk to voters, 
said Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), who also represents Pasadena. 
But, he said, "it's a tough district for Democrats to win because of the 
registration" edge. According to the Jan. 2 report of the Registrar of Voters, 
Republicans outnumber Democrats 78,805 to 64,745. 
</P>
<P>
A Democratic strategist who asked not to be identified said it appears unlikely 
that Democrats will pump large sums of money into a race against Nolan because 
even if they were successful, it "will be difficult to retain" such a 
Republican district in the 1992 election because of the registration 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
Both Democrats seeking the nomination said they are counting on isolating Nolan 
on the far right, especially on the question of abortion and family planning, 
which they believe will attract Republican voters 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there are a lot of Republican women, particularly professional 
Republican women, who support choice," Mann said. She said she believes they 
would consider crossing over on the issue now that the U.S. Supreme Court has 
allowed state legislatures to adopt laws restricting abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat McKenzie, who coincidentally taught Nolan in his geography class at 
USC in the 1970s, said his strategy is to develop grass-roots support based on 
his central position 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the voters will see that I stand where they do, in the center," he 
said, "a little right on foreign, a little left on domestic." 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie said he thinks the abortion and family planning issue will be the most 
significant of the campaign, even though Nolan recently supported a measure to 
restore cuts to family planning agencies. "I think Pat's position against 
pro-choice is fairly clear. I don't think one fairly recent vote makes a 
convert out of him." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Nolan or a spokesman could not be reached for comment on his position 
on the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan said he has joked with his former professor about the possibility of 
their being opponents. Nolan predicted it would "be a lively dialogue" should 
McKenzie win the Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat will characterize me as a liberal," McKenzie said. He said he thinks it 
would "come down to which candidate comes closer to the center position." 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie, however, has conceded that his Democratic rival enjoys a considerable 
advantage through her past political experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm running in a weakened posture because Jeanette is an old pro," he said of 
Mann. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, director of affirmative action at Cal State Northridge, got her first 
taste of politics as a "precinct man" in the Illinois system of Chicago's first 
Mayor Richard J. Daley. 
</P>
<P>
In her first crack at elected office, Mann in 1983 unseated a former mayor of 
Sierra Madre, Gary Adams, from the Pasadena City College District. She was 
reelected in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Mann has recently completed two years as co-chairman of ACT, a Pasadena 
political action group that has been successful in 26 out of 30 of its 
municipal endorsements since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Mann set a goal of raising $100,000 to $150,000 locally to show Democratic 
Party leaders that she can beat Nolan. Then, with an infusion of party money, 
she plans to strike on ethics and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the people in the 41st District need to be represented by 
someone who shares their ethical and moral values and I do," she said. 
</P>
<P>

SPARKING HIGHLAND PARK'S RENAISSANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD S. PALMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diane Alexander loved the newspaper review she read about a Russian 
delicatessen in West Hollywood, so she wrote a letter inviting its owner to 
move his operation to Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to expand, and he was very interested in Highland Park," said 
Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
But the owner decided he was not willing to sell his store to make the move. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, she went looking for another business to invite. And another. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander is part of a small but dedicated group of three Highland Park 
professionals that wants to revitalize the community from the inside out, 
hoping to bring in new businesses and spark a renaissance in the local arts 
community. 
</P>
<P>
A former member of the Highland Park Chamber of Commerce, Alexander wants to 
upgrade the city's commercial areas. Her colleague, Hendrik Stooker, is senior 
curator of the Occidental College art department, and wants to keep the 
community's artistic heritage alive. Completing the trio is Matt Marchand, a 
marketing director who has become the editor of the group's newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
Five months ago, they established the Arroyo Arts Collective to attract local 
artists and involve them in the process of changing the city. Their aims are 
very broad. On a practical level, the group wants to upgrade the shopping 
district and restore the city's older homes. It also hopes to attract more 
working artists to the city to make the city into a prominent arts colony. 
</P>
<P>
But they're finding that it is difficult to be a grass-roots catalyst for urban 
redesign. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking what we have that is positive and trying to expand for a better 
community, not waiting for it to happen to us, but making it happen for 
ourselves," Alexander said. "It is building a community from within, building 
on our strengths." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander's first target has been Figueroa Street, the city's main business 
corridor. Old homes and churches, side by side with discount shops and family 
eateries, line the four-lane street between York Boulevard and Avenue 50. But 
the discount stores are the prime focus for Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
"There is just a profusion of $3 dress shops up and down the avenue," she said. 
"We were tired of listening to people complain, 'We have to go to Pasadena to 
buy anything.' We just got together to see what we could do." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander decided the best way to go about changing Figueroa Street would be to 
try to attract a different mix of businesses from other cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We are keeping track of storefronts as they become available, and contacting 
businesses that seem appropriate to Highland Park," she said. So far, none has 
come as a direct response to her invitations, but Alexander said she is still 
trying. 
</P>
<P>
"I would love to see this become a restaurant row of international cuisine," 
she said. "Once we have that as a base, then other businesses can come in and 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
"Coffeehouses," said Alexander. "That is one of the first things we need." She 
would also like to attract a more sophisticated motion picture theater to 
replace a local one which she said features "slasher" films. 
</P>
<P>
Highland Park is a sprawling suburb, nestled between South Pasadena and Eagle 
Rock, about five miles from the Los Angeles Civic Center. A guild of artisans 
flourished there at the turn of the century and vestiges of that community can 
still be seen in the stained-glass makers of the Judson Studios. Today the 
neighborhoods are a collection of Victorian homes, modest Craftsman houses and 
a few apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"The nice thing about Highland Park is that it is like an urban village, just 
five minutes from downtown," said Alexander. "You walk down the street and you 
bump into friends." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, many people outside the area have a "totally wrong image" of 
Highland Park as a dangerous place, according to Stooker, who worked with 
Alexander to establish the collective. Stooker said the criminal element in 
Highland Park is minor, "but it gets a lot of publicity." He said he finds the 
image undeserved. 
</P>
<P>
Stooker earned a degree in arts education from an art academy in the 
Netherlands and has done graduate work in art history at UCLA. Prior to his 
arrival at Occidental he worked at an art gallery in Beverly Hills and nursed a 
struggling gallery in Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
He became aware of Alexander's efforts to attract new businesses to the area 
and decided they might attract working artists too. 
</P>
<P>
"There are hundreds of professionals in the arts living and working in this 
area," said Stooker. As more artists move into Highland Park it will reflect 
positively on the community, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For Stooker, an important part of the collective's work is making residents 
aware of vintage homes in the area. "It's a historic neighborhood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another goal of the Arroyo Arts Collective is to find people who are interested 
in the arts and who will invest in the Highland Park community. The members 
want to attract potential home buyers, tell them about the local history, then 
persuade them to refurbish their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main effort is communication; searching out and finding people," said 
Marchand. In just five months the mailing list for their newsletter has grown 
to more than 300 names, he said. "We just want to prove that there is a vital 
arts environment in the Highland Park area." 
</P>
<P>
Marchand handles project development for Photo Ventures, a publishing company. 
For the last two years he has worked with photographer William Reagh to produce 
a calendar documenting urban redevelopment in the Bunker Hill section of Los 
Angeles. Reagh's before and after photographs span five decades of 
architectural construction downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Marchand said Highland Park needs creative people who can renovate existing 
structures and design new ones. 
</P>
<P>
"The community is really ripe for it now," he said. "Highland Park really needs 
the talents of innovative architects to save it." 
</P>
<P>
With the group's newsletter, Marchand is able to spotlight local examples of 
creative housing design. The January issue carried a story about the Aldama 
Duplexes. These multilevel hillside homes, with lofts and tall clerestory 
windows, were designed by architect Allyn E. Morris in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Because the collective is so young, it is hard to determine whether it has had 
much success in meeting its goals. It is clear that lower housing costs have 
induced some people to buy homes in the area. Whether many of the new arrivals 
are artists, and whether the group's activities helped attract them, is 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Crime in the central city was a big reason for Stephen Kafer's move to Highland 
Park, where he bought a house in 1985. He said thieves had broken into both his 
car and his studio in the Little Tokyo district of Los Angeles. Kafer is a 
sculptor who works in steel, glass and concrete. He has added a second story to 
his house, and now works out of his home studio. 
</P>
<P>
"I was paying less to buy a house than it cost me to rent a studio," Kafer 
said. "I was getting real tired of all the concrete. It seemed much more 
reasonable to have a house with a yard. There is a nice rural feeling to the 
area." 
</P>
<P>
Kafer offers some evidence that the collective is having an effect along 
Figueroa Street. Some new restaurants have opened and some commercial buildings 
are being renovated, he said. But a local real estate broker sees a different 
reason for the changes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel it has anything to do with artists," said Martha Marshall. "What 
is really coming in is the Asian influence. Any business you walk into on 
Figueroa now, you will find, is Asian owned and operated. They're the ones with 
the cash. I don't see at all that it is artists." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander agrees that "there are huge numbers of Asians coming in from many 
countries." She said Highland Park is evolving into an international community 
with a broad mix of ethnic cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Marshall acknowledges the presence of artists, but said most of those 
she knows have been in the area since she moved there 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said the average home price in Highland Park is $214,000. "Most 
artists can't afford that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The core members of the collective remain optimistic about their work, even in 
the face of some frustration. Three people "can only do so much," Stooker 
explained. Thus far the three of them have paid for most of the group's 
activities and the newsletter out of their own pockets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
One plan in the works would bring performances of the Los Angeles Bach Festival 
to Highland Park in October. And a landscape design contest proposed a 
mini-park on a triangular vacant lot near Figueroa. But neither plan has been 
finalized. 
</P>
<P>
The collective has been very effective fostering a group spirit among local 
artists. It has sponsored a series of social gatherings and organizational 
meetings. Alexander said a December brunch brought together about 60 people. 
</P>
<P>
Although change has been slow in coming, Alexander's efforts to reshape the 
Figueroa Street business corridor have not gone unnoticed. Heather Hoggan, who 
is president of the Highland Park Heritage Trust, said Alexander is making a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
"Figueroa has always been a tough nut to crack," said Hoggan. "I think change 
will come from what Diane Alexander is doing."

COMMUNITY DIGEST: SOUTH GATE; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICER HONORED FOR WORK IN RECOVERING STOLEN CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officer Michael Flanagan of the South Gate Police Department has received the 
California Highway Patrol's distinquished "10851" award, which recognizes 
officers for recovering stolen automobiles and arresting suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan recovered at least 12 stolen vehicles and arrested three suspected car 
thieves during 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan was recently presented a "10851" pin and a plaque by the Automobile 
Club of Southern California, a program sponsor. Police officers arrest suspects 
for stealing vehicles under the California Vehicle Code 10851. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan, 34, has been with the 91-officer South Gate department for 12 years, 
working asa patrolman, traffic officer and investigator of stolen autos. 
</P>
<P>
Like many areas in the state, South Gate has a big problem with auto thefts, 
Capt. George B. Troxcil said. A department goal is to reduce the number of such 
thefts in the city this year, Troxcil said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, there were 1,356 vehicles stolen, or 17.12 thefts per 1,000 residents, 
according to the South Gate police.

PARK VISITOR CENTER STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State parks officials are considering a plan to build a 12,000-square-foot 
visitor center at Will Rogers State Historic Park, a state parks official said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It is strictly in the talking stage at this point, but we expect we may have a 
proposal by April or May," said George Rackelman, a parks department official 
who is helping put together a general plan for the park. 
</P>
<P>
The visitor center is among several possible improvements being considered by a 
team of parks officials and volunteer docents. Other proposals include 
additional parking, an improved road into the park and construction of new 
restrooms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The park is the former ranch of the late humorist Will Rogers. It was donated 
to the state in 1944 upon the death of Rogers' widow. Besides a ranch house, 
the park includes stables, a polo field, picnic area and nature trails.

SCOPE: QUALITY TIME FOR SOME FAMILIES IS A TRIP TO CLASSROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA GRIEGO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Nix had not been back to school in 14 years, and he never expected that 
the day he finally returned he would find himself sitting in a circle singing 
the children's song, "Cheesecake, gobble gobble, cheesecake gobble gobble." 
</P>
<P>
But there he was, with wife Andrea, his two daughters Shante and Tiffany, and 
15 other children he had never laid eyes on, watching a banjo-playing teacher 
who called himself Michael Jackson and referred to the rest of the class as the 
Jackson family. 
</P>
<P>
"This is fantastic," Nix said. "It makes you feel like a kid all over again." 
</P>
<P>
Nix, a 31-year-old janitor, went to Washington Elementary School in Bellflower 
on a recent Saturday with his family to relearn some of the basic academic 
skills he had forgotten since graduating from Centennial High School in 
Compton. 
</P>
<P>
What he got was his first computer lesson, a few sing-alongs with teacher Jim 
Lanners, a.k.a. Michael Jackson, a lecture on personal safety from the 
"Stranger Danger Lady" who warned the children against talking to strangers, 
and his first homework assignment since 1976: instructions for the family to 
create whatever they wanted from a bag of marshmallows, a box of Jell-O and 
some toothpicks. 
</P>
<P>
The Nix family is among the first participants in a Bellflower Unified School 
District program for parents who do not have the money to go back to school and 
who are looking for a way to spend more time with their children, project 
coordinator Linda Bobkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
Every Saturday for half a day, parents and their children meet at Washington 
Elementary School, where they play together for one hour until parents separate 
to attend classes that hone their reading, writing and mathematics skills on a 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
Bobkowski calls the 14-week program Parent Partners and said it is the only 
program in Los Angeles County and perhaps Southern California designed to get 
low-income families involved in school life. Bobkowski said children are taught 
hygiene, self-esteem, good nutrition and personal safety, and their mothers and 
fathers learn basic parenting and academic skills. 
</P>
<P>
"How can the parents help their kids if they don't have the skills?" Bobkowski 
asked parents recently. "A lot of parents don't want to help their kids with 
schoolwork, because they don't know how to do it. It doesn't mean you are 
stupid or uneducated. It just means you need help in basic skills." 
</P>
<P>
During the first meeting of Parent Partners in a classroom with crooked 
Valentine hearts pasted on the windows and wooden dinosaur toys scattered 
about, Nix grabbed the chance to relearn what he said he did not learn well in 
the first place -- math, reading and writing. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a chance for me to make up for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bobkowski said the program is modeled after a federal program known as Even 
Start. It is Bobkowski's hope that Parent Partners will eventually be funded by 
a federal grant. The $4,000 project was coordinated by Bobkowski, Merwyn Smith, 
director of adult education programs, and Maryann Suggs, director of child 
development programs. It is supported by federal funds for poverty level 
families. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure that when parents are learning, kids are learning, too," 
Suggs said. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven families have joined already, and Smith said that because the program is 
well under way no more families will be allowed to join. 
</P>
<P>
On the first Saturday of the program, nine families with about 20 children gave 
up a sunny weekend morning to go to school, and no one seemed to mind. They 
came for different reasons: some to learn how to work with their children, some 
to show their children that they are interested in what they do at school, and 
some to brush up on academic skills. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to help everybody all the way around," said Donna Rodgers, 53, who 
attended the classes with her daughter and 6-year-old grandson, Brian. "I've 
always wanted to learn the computer. If I had one at home, I could find 
something to do to supplement my income. Anything would help." 
</P>
<P>
Third-grader Cheri Ballard, who was busy covering the classroom's frantic 
gerbil with raw white rice, did not know much about her mother's being able to 
take classes, but said she was glad her mother was coming to school. "We never 
get to see her that much," Cheri said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheri's mother, Sharon, said: "I wasn't sure what this program was going to be 
about," Ballard said. "I just knew I needed more communication and time with my 
daughters. This will give us a chance to have time together, I hope." 
</P>
<P>
For Mireya and Sebastian Cerda, Parent Partners is much more than being able to 
spend time with their 3-year-old daughter, Angela, or sitting down in front of 
a computer for the first time. It is an indoctrination into American society, 
Mireya Cerda said. The couple moved to Bellflower from Chile about 1 1/2 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We come from another culture," she said. "We are learning two things. We are 
learning about the society and we are learning to be parents."

<P>
COUNCIL ASKED TO SPEED UP SEARCH FOR NEW MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Interim City Manager Jerry Shuster has asked officials to speed up their search 
for a permanent chief administrator because he is ready to leave Artesia after 
four months in the position. 
</P>
<P>
Shuster, who is a retired finance director of Arcadia, has been interim city 
manager of Artesia since October. 
</P>
<P>
He replaced Lois O'Sullivan, who resigned. Shuster, 59, said he took the job 
with the understanding he would not be there long. "I did not retire to go back 
to work full time," Shuster said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he told the City Council two weeks ago to start a more vigorous search 
because he was leaving in 30 days. But Mayor Dennis Fellows said Shuster was 
persuaded to remain at least another 60 days, until someone is hired. 
</P>
<P>
Fellows said the council has received one applicant for the job. He said the 
council expects to start advertising in newspapers and government publications. 
</P>
<P>
Shuster is paid $40 an hour, but the salary for a permanent administrator is 
negotiable and depends on the person's experience.

PLANNED PARENTHOOD GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $25,00 allocation to Pasadena Planned Parenthood, reluctantly approved in 
December by the city Board of Directors, will not be needed this fiscal year 
after all. 
</P>
<P>
City directors were informed Tuesday that the family planning agency will 
receive its full state funding to operate a clinic at 1045 N. Lake Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gov. George Deukmejian had cut statewide family planning funds last 
year, the Legislature restored the money in a bill passed in January. 
</P>
<P>
However, if Deukmejian pursues funding cuts already proposed for the next 
fiscal year, Pasadena Planned Parenthood could draw on a second $25,000 
allocation approved by directors in December. 
</P>
<P>
After the board approved the appropriations to Planned Parenthood and two other 
social service agencies, it created a committee that is devising a city policy 
governing aid to nonprofit agencies.

1,001 SIGN PETITION FOR COUNCILMAN FREGEAU RECALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Organizers of a recall campaign against Cudahy Councilman Joseph Fregeau have 
gathered more than enough signatures to force a special election if the 
petition is approved by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Acting City Manager Jack Joseph said the Committee for Good Government on 
Monday turned in a petition with 1,001 signatures supporting a recall election. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph said 809 valid signatures are needed for the petition to qualify. The 
city has 30 days to verify the signatures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee last September launched a recall campaign against Fregeau and 
Councilman John Robertson after they voted to switch the city's law enforcement 
service from the Bell Police Department to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department. The recall against Robertson was dropped recently. 
</P>
<P>
Committee member Georgia Scrivner called the day the petition was turned in the 
"greatest day of my life."

SEWER CHARGE CHANGES OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has unanimously approved changing sewer charges for 
single-family residences from a flat fee to one that is linked to water 
consumption during the 1990-91 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The old flat-rate fee system was adopted in 1978, but a recent study by the 
consulting firm Psomas &amp; Associates concluded that it is feasible to start 
charging sewage fees based on readings from water meters, according to a staff 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The new fee system, however, cannot be applied to apartment and condominiums 
that are served by a single water meter. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, owners who want to avoid sewer charges on water used to 
irrigate lawns and gardens could install a separate meter for outdoor water 
use. A city staff report advised owners who use more than 35,000 cubic feet of 
water a year for irrigation to install an additional meter.

HILLSIDE TASK FORCE FORMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A task force, whose nine members include attorneys representing land owners and 
hillside preservationists, has been created to devise changes to the city's 
strict hillside ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The group will present its revisions within 90 days for approval by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
The members are Dale Beland and Steven Broiles, attorneys representing hillside 
property owners; John Betterly, a land-use consultant; Caroline Brown and Verna 
Chilton, members of the Hillside Coalition; George Maurer, a Sierra Madre 
councilman; Gurdon Miller, a Los Angeles city planner and member of the 
Hillside Coalition; Ross Tyree, chairman of the city's Planning Commission, and 
Ted Willis, a hillside property owner. 
</P>
<P>
The city's strict hillside development ordinance was hastily adopted by the 
City Council in January when it learned a moratorium on hillside building had 
expired. The ordinance creates five zones and limits construction to densities 
ranging from five to 40 acres per house.

COUNCIL OKS HOUSING LIMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday tentatively approved an ordinance to tighten 
regulations on building second units on lots zoned for single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
The changes would impose a size limit of 640 square feet for second units and 
would require that the property owner occupy at least one of the units. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Brad McFadden dissented in the 4-1 vote, arguing that a maximum of 
800 square feet was preferable. He added that he didn't believe in restricting 
property rights. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission initiated the revisions in July. "People were building 
normal-sized homes, sometimes bigger than existing homes," Planning Assistant 
Brad Dunlap said. Planning Director Patricia Haley said in a report that 
neighbors were increasingly concerned about noise, traffic and loss of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city received seven requests to build second units and has 
received one this year. The council will vote again on the ordinance March 12. 
If approved, the law would take effect 30 days later.

COUNCIL ORDERS RENT STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council, concerned about reports of rent gouging, has asked a city 
commission, the city's fair housing agency and a landlord group to study the 
problem and make recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Edna Scott, fair housing coordinator for the Pomona Neighborhood Center, told 
the council that landlords are buying up slum property and raising rents 
drastically without making improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants who refuse to pay the increased rents are being evicted, she said, 
adding that some are unable to find other shelter and are left homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The council, on a 3-2 vote, decided to ask the Community Life Commission, which 
oversees city housing funds, to meet with the Pomona Neighborhood Center and an 
apartment owners organization to consider the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Donna Smith and Councilman Mark A.T. Nymeyer voted against the action 
after expressing concern that the city might be headed toward rent control. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant said imposing rent control would be a last 
resort. "If we can possibly avoid rent control, I would lean hard in that 
direction," he said.

MALATHION MEETING PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor William Thomson will try to set up a meeting in late March among Southern 
California city officials opposed to malathion aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Board of Directors voted Tuesday to organize the meeting as a 
follow-up to its action last week banning low-altitude flights over Pasadena. 
City police helicopters were sent out to enforce the ordinance against 
helicopter pilots spraying malathion. The action prompted a meeting with Gov. 
George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson said he would try to call a meeting March 22 or 23, when more than 300 
city officials and staff members are expected to attend a Southern California 
Assn. of Governments meeting at the Pasadena Hilton Hotel.

PEPPERDINE RECEIVES $94,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $94,000 grant has been awarded to Pepperdine University to help a professor 
develop a history of the Churches of Christ and to help finance a conference on 
Christian primitivism at the Malibu campus next year, a university spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the grant awarded by the Pew Charitable Trusts will be used to support 
the work of Richard Hughes, a professor of religion, who is writing a book 
tracing the history of the Churches of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
The book is to be included in the "Denominations of America" series, to be 
published by Greenwood Press, university spokesman Jeff Bliss said. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine has maintained a close relationship with the Churches of Christ 
since the university was founded in 1937 by George Pepperdine, a lifelong 
member of the denomination. 
</P>

The conference, titled "Christian Primitivism and Modernism: Coming to Terms 
with Our Age," is expected to bring together scholars and leaders of 
primitivist Christian groups from all over the United States, Bliss said.

GLENDALE COLLEGE ORDERS BAN ON INDOOR SMOKING 
</P>

The Glendale College Board of Trustees has voted unanimously to prohibit 
smoking in the buildings on its campus. 
</P>
<P>
The ban was approved Monday and will take effect in two weeks to allow students 
and staff to adjust to the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
It affects smoking in the student cafeteria, in faculty and staff dining rooms 
and in private offices on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Smoking has been prohibited in the classrooms for many years. Smoking will be 
allowed outdoors, except in posted areas. 
</P>
<P>
"If the airlines can do it, then Glendale Community College can do it," said 
Board President Ted Tiffany. College staff proposed the ban as a way to protect 
nonsmokers' rights to clean air, said Thomas M. Fallo, vice president of 
administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
There are no guidelines for enforcing the policy. "Peer pressure will probably 
be sufficient for the present time," Fallo said. 
</P>
<P>
Student Body President Tod Campbell said that student opinion was mixed on the 
issue. Some smokers are not pleased with the ban, but it is timely and 
appropriate, considering the health benefits of such a measure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Robert K. Holmes also proposed a ban on selling cigarettes at the 
college. Supt. John Davitt said that the only source of cigarettes on campus, a 
vending machine near the science building, is to be eliminated by March 1.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LESS FUNDING MAY LEAD TO TEACHER LAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with a potential $1.8-million budget shortfall, Ventura Unified School 
District administrators have announced that administrators, teachers and 
programs in the 25-school district could face cutbacks, including layoffs and 
elimination of special programs. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement at Tuesday evening's school board meeting followed Gov. George 
Deukmejian's proposal to trim the cost-of-living increase for California's 
elementary and secondary schools to 3%, instead of the 4.95% called for by law. 
</P>
<P>
A 3% cost-of-living increase will reduce district revenues by $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
District officials have notified principals of potential reassignments for the 
1990-91 school year, a proposal that could put some administrators back in the 
classroom. The school board will decide whether to notify teachers of potential 
layoffs at the next board meeting, March 13.

COMPTON, TARGETING DRUG DEALERS, TO ASK BUSINESSES TO RESTRICT PAY PHONE USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE FUETSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

COMPTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Council members, in a move similar to those of other Southland cities 
plagued by drug trafficking, have decided to try to short-circuit the dealers 
by taking aim at one of their most important tools, the pay telephone. 
</P>
<P>
The council unanimously voted Tuesday to move to persuade private business 
owners with pay telephones to restrict the phones to outgoing calls. 
</P>
<P>
Compton Police Cmdr. Terry Ebert, explaining that drug dealers set up shop 
around pay telephones in Laundromats, liquor stores, fast food restaurants and 
convenience markets and take orders over the phone. "They use the phone booth 
like an office," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, where some pay phones have been removed altogether, police 
estimated last year that as many as three-quarters of all drug deals are 
arranged on pay telephones. Pay phones have become a popular tool, police say, 
because calls are hard to trace and because they allow dealers to operate 
without a permanent address. 
</P>
<P>
Compton's effort will be modeled after a program started last fall in 
Inglewood. Compton officials will contact individual business owners and ask 
them to work with the phone company to restrict pay phones to outgoing calls. 
</P>
<P>
The business owners would continue to receive money from phone companies for 
housing the pay phones. The phone companies would not suffer financially 
because they only make money on outgoing calls, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it will deter a little of the crime," Councilwoman Bernice Woods said 
of the city's plan. 
</P>
<P>
She said business owners probably will welcome the idea. "Businesses are tired 
of the loafing. It hurts everybody's business," she said, adding that potential 
customers do not stop at stores or restaurants when they see a lot of suspected 
dealers hanging around. 
</P>
<P>
The council rejected any attempt to remove pay telephones. "In Compton," Ebert 
said, "there's a large number of people who don't have telephones and need them 
for emergencies, so we wouldn't, say, take out the telephones altogether." 
</P>
<P>
Some communities, such as Long Beach, have removed pay phones in selected 
neighborhoods. At least nine phones n the West Adams area of Los Angeles were 
removed at the behest of residents who complained that drug dealers were using 
the phones for sales. 
</P>
<P>
A Venice resident, outraged because he believed a proliferation of pay phones 
had turned his neighborhood into a drug supermarket, took an ax to several pay 
phones. 
</P>
<P>
Compton police have already arranged to have some pay phones moved in order to 
break up drug sales activity. At Lueders Park on the city's northside, for 
example, there was a phone booth outside a liquor store at the edge of the 
park. When the city built a police substation at the park two years ago, the 
phone was moved next to the substation door.

WATER EMERGENCY DECLARED IN VENTURA; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATION: THE CITY COUNCIL DELAYS DISCUSSION OF A RATIONING PROPOSAL AFTER 
AGREEING THAT A DROUGHT-RELATED SHORTAGE EXISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura City Council declared a water shortage emergency early Tuesday 
morning after a lengthy public hearing in which dozens of residents begged for 
exemptions and proposed alternatives to the city's stringent water conservation 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously to declare the emergency but postponed discussion 
on the water conservation ordinance. Mayor Richard Francis said he was 
exhausted after hearing more than five hours of public testimony that stretched 
the Monday evening session into Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's a reasonable person in this city who doubts there's a 
drought," Vice Mayor Donald Villeneuve said after introducing the emergency 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
But the murmurs from the 20 or so residents who remained in the City Council 
chambers to witness the vote made it clear that not everyone agreed that the 
city needs the type or magnitude of the proposed water conservation measures. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said that because of low rainfall over the past three years, 
water reserves from the Ventura River, which is the major supplier of water to 
eastern Ventura, are about one-third short of demand. The Lake Casitas 
Reservoir, which supplies west Ventura, have dwindled too, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of complicated legal arrangements between the city and the Lake Casitas 
Water District, the district only provides enough water to cover the west 
side's needs, further compounding the city's problems. 
</P>
<P>
The draft ordinance outlines water quotas for residences, businesses and 
institutions, with penalties of up to 10 times the normal water rate for 
excessive use. 
</P>
<P>
Residents would be given fixed quotas, plus bonuses based on their average use 
over the past three years, if their average exceeds their allocation. Residents 
of single-family houses would receive one-third more water than residents of 
apartments, condominiums and mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses, institutions and fruit growers would be forced to reduce water 
usage between 15% and 20% but would not be regulated by a quota system. 
</P>
<P>
Another provision would ban all new water service hookups, which amounts to a 
moratorium on new construction. 
</P>
<P>
The council must decide among five options in implementing that provision. The 
most stringent would block the construction of 1,662 units, the least stringent 
would block 103 proposed units. 
</P>
<P>
The city's goal is to reduce water usage by 30%, Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's hearing was the second in as many weeks on water rationing. About 300 
people packed the City Council chambers and spilled into an adjoining 
auditorium, where the meeting was shown on television monitors. 
</P>
<P>
About 45 speakers disputed just about every provision of the proposed 
ordinance, although almost all acknowledged that the city had to take immediate 
action to conserve water. 
</P>
<P>
Growth advocates blasted city officials for trying to eliminate hookups. They 
said city officials should more aggressively pursue alternative water sources, 
including state-owned water from Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"Just think of all the painters, plumbers, tile people, where would they all 
go?" if the city enacts a building ban, asked Ted Temple, who runs a small 
construction business. "This community has to maintain some sense of vitality." 
</P>
<P>
No-growth supporters criticized city officials for considering the use of 
state-owned water, which they contended would lead to further development. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard enough from these whining, cement-loving developers. . . . If we 
import state water, it's all over for Ventura," Bill Loci said. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Baker told the audience that it is impossible to tailor the 
conservation ordinance to meet everybody's needs. He said that is why an appeal 
process for residents who would suffer undue hardships from water rationing had 
been included in the ordinance.

RIBET A STUDY IN DISCIPLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In keeping with the school's college prep curriculum, Coach Michael Miller 
regularly distributes homework to his players on the Ribet Academy boys' 
basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
The assignments vary, but many involve exercises in self-evaluation, motivation 
and goal-setting techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to make people think," Miller says, "because it's a thinking game." 
</P>
<P>
Collectively, the Fighting Frogs must be thinking they're a pretty good team. 
</P>
<P>
Ribet breezed through its Heritage League schedule undefeated, destroying 
opponents by an average of 46 points a game, and could be on the verge of 
winning the school's first Southern Section title. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked Fighting Frogs (24-2) will get their title shot Friday when they 
play second-ranked St. Margaret's of San Juan Capistrano in the Southern 
Section Small Schools Division championship game at Saddleback College in 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here because of the opportunity to win a championship," says Miller, 
25, who is in his first season at Ribet after coaching Cathedral High to 
consecutive Santa Fe League titles and semifinal appearances in the Southern 
Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, most of the key players for the Fighting Frogs are at Ribet because of 
Miller, whom they met through all-star summer leagues, camps and clinics. 
</P>
<P>
A familiar coach, a prep school education and financial assistance from the 
school to help them pay the $4,000-a-year tuition drew juniors Jacquin Moore 
and Jamal Duncan and highly-touted freshmen Jason Sanders and Andre English to 
Ribet's La Canada campus. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, a 6-foot-2 forward from Gardena, is the Fighting Frogs' leading scorer, 
averaging 18 points and eight rebounds a game. Duncan, a point guard from Los 
Angeles, averages 16 points. Sanders, a 6-3 guard from Los Angeles, also 
averages 16 points while English, a 6-5 center, scores about six. 
</P>
<P>
The players car pool to school each day. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Miller) said I would have the opportunity to come here and better my 
education as well as play basketball," says Duncan, who transferred from 
Inglewood High. "I didn't want to leave at first. I had all of my regular 
friends and I was playing at a big school. But I figured it was worth it to 
tear away from that." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders says he came to Ribet for the education and the opportunity to play 
varsity basketball as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had gone to another public school, I probably would have sat the bench," 
says Sanders, who scored 35 points in the Fighting Frogs' first-round playoff 
victory over Claremont of Garden Grove. "It's 40 minutes back and forth each 
day, but I felt, with my parents, that it would be better for me in the long 
run." 
</P>
<P>
Several opposing coaches likely hold the opinion that what's good for Ribet 
isn't necessarily good for the Heritage League or Small School basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Ribet already had plenty of talented players before Miller arrived with some 
that were even better. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Frogs had won or shared three consecutive league titles before 
this season and advanced to the Southern Section semifinals last year. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, however, is unfazed by his critics. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to cheat our kids out of doing their best," he says. "We want 
our kids to achieve something. 
</P>
<P>
"They (opponents) didn't feel sorry for Ribet when they were beating Ribet by 
70 points when it first opened." 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Frogs don't figure to find themselves on either end of a blowout 
against St. Margaret's, which is led by 6-7 center Ryan Westendorf. 
</P>
<P>
If Ribet wins the Small Schools championship, the Fighting Frogs will advance 
to the state tournament. If they lose, they still will have enjoyed the best 
season in school history. 
</P>
<P>
This year's team could, therefore, find itself the focus of one of Miller's 
practice-day lessons or homework assignments. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to show my players examples of people that are being successful and 
people that are being failures that could have been successful," Miller says. 
"I try to make it as realistic as possible so they can understand what they can 
do so they don't make the same mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"If it just helps one of them, it's worth it."

OXNARD BUDGET HONORED DESPITE PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Oxnard, plagued by financial problems for more than eight months, 
has received two statewide awards this year for achievements in budgeting 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard was one of four cities with a population of 125,000 or more to receive 
an award for its 1989-90 operating budget from the California Society of 
Municipal Finance Officers. 
</P>
<P>
The group also presented Oxnard with an award for its 1988-89 fiscal year 
financial report. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important to recognize what these awards represent is that the 
city of Oxnard discloses information regarding actual revenues and expenses so 
the City Council and public are fully aware of where the money goes," said Bill 
Mayer, Oxnard's budget director. "It sets the basis for decision making." 
</P>
<P>
The operating budget, which estimates revenues and expenses for the coming 
year, was judged on the basis of how easy it is for the layman to understand, 
said Amy Chan, director of finances for the city of Sunnyvale and one of the 
judges who made the award. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not looking at the financial health of the city as much as the 
document itself," Chan said. "We wanted to see if the reader was able to 
understand what it was telling people." 
</P>
<P>
The statewide organization is a group of city finance directors. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 43 cities that submitted operating budgets for review, 18 received 
awards. Oxnard, Pasadena, Santa Ana and Stockton received the award for cities 
with populations at or above 125,000. 
</P>
<P>
The financial report, which details the actual expenses and revenues determined 
by an audit at the end of a fiscal year, was judged on the basis of such things 
as its footnotes and statistical section. 
</P>
<P>
Of 105 cities that applied for the award, 102 received it. It is the first year 
that Oxnard has been cited for its financial report. 
</P>
<P>
But Oxnard has also become known for its budget problems, having engaged in a 
series of budget cuts that were in part necessitated by miscalculations in 
revenues and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
It was disclosed last fall that estimates of revenues for the 1988-89 fiscal 
year were $2 million too high. At the same time, it was learned that the city 
had overspent its budget by $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
City leaders subsequently made more than $1 million in reductions, slashing 16 
city positions and reducing department budgets. The decreases followed $1.9 
million in cutbacks made in June.

MOORPARK OFFICIALS CONTEND AMBULANCES TAKE TOO LONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of discontent, two Moorpark City Council members this week charged 
that the Ventura County emergency medical services network is too slow in 
dispatching ambulances to ill and injured residents. 
</P>
<P>
Ambulance service is so slow in Moorpark that "residents are probably better 
off transporting the victims themselves than waiting for the ambulance," 
Moorpark Councilman Clint Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are studying the cost of establishing an independent paramedic 
and ambulance service that will get to patients in less than 10 minutes, the 
county's required response time for larger metropolitan and urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
County officials who monitor emergency calls say ambulances do respond within 
an adequate time frame for an area such as Moorpark -- less than 15 minutes for 
most emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
"Granted, 15 minutes is a lot of time to wait for an ambulance, but we have 
areas of the county that have to wait an hour and a half," said Barbara 
Brodfuehrer, administrator of the county's Emergency Medical Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The county will do its first study of ambulance response times this year to 
determine if there are areas where emergency vehicles are taking too long to 
retrieve patients, Brodfuehrer said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Moorpark is the only city in the county where officials have complained 
about ambulance service, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Murphy, chief administrative officer for Pruner Ambulance, said the 
company is not slow to respond to emergency calls. When the county renewed its 
contract with the ambulance company last year, it found that in 91% of the 
cases, ambulances arrived in less than 15 minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even with population growth, Moorpark does not require an ambulance base 
station, Murphy added. Moorpark issues an average of 43 calls a month and about 
a third of them are canceled before an ambulance arrives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a small town with a relatively low number of calls per month," Murphy 
said. Murphy added that city officials have not complained to the county nor to 
Pruner officials about slow response times. 
</P>
<P>
The county bases its 15-minute requirement for emergency calls to Moorpark on 
population figures based on a census tract that includes less densely populated 
areas outside of the city, rather than the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
In Moorpark, where officials have clocked some ambulance response times at 37 
minutes, Councilwoman Eloise Brown said that method is now outdated. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that when you're trying to serve the area, and the area grows, then 
the geographic center of the population changes," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
In a city of more than 26,000 people, ambulances should be arriving as quickly 
in Moorpark as they do in neighboring Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks, Brown 
said.

Pruner ambulances must cross nine miles of highway to get to people in 
Moorpark, then drive eight miles to Los Robles Regional Medical Center in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Growing population may lengthen response times to Moorpark as roads become 
choked with rush-hour traffic, Harper said. Traffic on city roads leading to 
Moorpark is already backed up at rush hour.

DAY ONE STORY GOOD BUT PLACEMENT IS QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you so much for the much deserved attention to the local heroes at Day 
One who are on the front line in Pasadena's battle in the war on drugs (Times, 
Feb. 25). People like Francisca Neumann are doing more to get kids off drugs 
than are people like William Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
Now all we have to do is get people who have power, like Mr. Bennett, to 
concentrate their efforts on supporting people like Ms. Neumann. 
</P>
<P>
The time is also appropriate to repeat the proper credit you gave to 
enlightened corporations, like Kaiser Permanente, who realize that part of the 
privilege of operating in a free society is the responsibility to help care for 
the citizenry of that society. 
</P>
<P>
But why was an article on a subject of such societal import hidden on Page 2 
next to the public auction ads, when last week (Feb. 18) you had on the front 
page (with a picture, no less) an article on a book about the trees of San 
Marino? In your Day One article Mr. Ibrahim Naeem spoke of the "tremendous 
denial" that exists in people's minds about the pervasiveness of drug abuse. As 
long as the trees of San Marino get top billing over the problem of drug abuse 
and programs like Day One, we, as a society, will continue to be in a state of 
denial.

AGENCIES COOPERATE ON CRIME IN MONROVIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

MONROVIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A crime-plagued apartment complex on the east side of town has become the 
testing ground for a new, multi-pronged crackdown by government officials. 
</P>
<P>
Police have made eight arrests at the pair of single-story blue buildings on 
South California Avenue within the last month, for charges ranging from 
malicious mischief to car theft to drug use. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, city code enforcement officers have slapped the owner with 12 code 
violation notices ordering him to cover exposed electrical wires, fix cracked 
windows, and remove a discarded washing machine, some broken refrigerators and 
at least six abandoned cars from the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Even the county Community Development Commission, which uses federal funds to 
subsidize rent for tenants in about half of the complex's 12 units, is pitching 
in with letters to pressure the owner to clean up his property. 
</P>
<P>
The joint effort is just what Police Chief Joseph Santoro had in mind when he 
formed a committee last month to harness the resources of city departments and 
community agencies for crime-fighting and neighborhood improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"He's moving beyond traditional police strategies and outside the organization 
into the community," said City Manager Jim Starbird, who praised Santoro's 
approach as a "tremendously effective" management philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"The strategy is to identify problems and draw on all resources," Santoro said. 
For instance, police might direct a wayward youth into sports or counseling 
programs instead of ignoring him until his next arrest. "It's a matter of 
coordinating (services) and focusing them on a situation. In the long run, 
it'll save a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
The police chief is also instructing his officers to be on the lookout for 
crime patterns. 
</P>
<P>
"Previously, they'd handle one incident and then move on," Santoro said. "We're 
going to be asking . . . if they see a unique pattern emerging, that it come up 
the chain of command. We may be able to put the fire out, but to prevent it 
from igniting again we have to look at the larger picture." 
</P>
<P>
So he began assembling the as-yet-unnamed committee with representatives from 
the city's Community Development Department and Housing Division. Its first 
project was to come up with ideas for tackling the situation at the east-side 
apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to attack it from every which way," Santoro said. "The biggest 
thing is sharing information." 
</P>
<P>
Last month Senior Code Enforcement Officer Dan McConnell, a committee member, 
inspected the property on a tip from police and notified the owner of the 12 
code violations. If uncorrected, each violation becomes a misdemeanor 
punishable by up to a $500 fine and a year in county jail. 
</P>
<P>
"Some (violations) are already taken care of," McConnell said. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Niijar, who owns the buildings, said he is happy to cooperate with 
authorities. He acknowledged that there is a problem with dumped appliances and 
broken couches left in the complex's back parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Every month I end up spending $150 just to have the trash moved," he said. He 
believes most of the drug-related problems are caused by outsiders, perhaps 
youths he has seen hanging around outside the complex. 
</P>
<P>
"I've driven by the property many times and asked them what they're doing 
there, but on the streets I have no authority to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
City Housing Division Manager Steve Cervantes said he has recommended increased 
security precautions at the complex, including lighting improvements and 
raising the height of a six-foot wrought iron fence to about eight feet. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't really require that," he said. "These are just kind of strong 
suggestions." He also persuaded the county Community Development Commission to 
write to the owner, urging him to pay more attention to his property. 
</P>
<P>
The city's own Community Development Department has cooperated with police in 
the past, but the affiliation has been informal and sporadic. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all terribly excited about the prospects that this (committee) has," 
city Community Development Director Don Hopper said. "We're anxious to get this 
off the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Many cities have informally merged law enforcement with government and 
community agencies on occasion, said Glen Bell, president of the San Gabriel 
Valley Police Chiefs Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Bell said that in Burbank, where he serves as police chief, the city manager 
has assigned members of other city divisions to work with the Police Department 
on a case-by-case basis. "Every community does its own thing." 
</P>
<P>
Some cities, including Pasadena and Pomona, have more structured arrangements, 
similar to the new program in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
In Pasadena, Police Lt. Gregg Henderson chairs an advisory board with 
representatives from 13 agencies, including the NAACP, the Urban League and El 
Centro de Accion Social, a social service agency. The 3-year-old group holds 
monthly meetings to provide a forum for community concerns and opinions on 
police effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson also leads a 14-member committee formed in 1987 with representatives 
from city departments, including Public Works, Zoning and Planning. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone in and cleaned properties up, and turned them around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Pomona have formed Combined Agencies, a coalition of 48 area 
groups that has been working with the Police Department for three years. 
</P>
<P>
"There's too much work for any one agency to do," said Ted Burnett, the 
director of a family counseling center and a leader of the network. Focusing on 
at-risk youth, the committee meets twice monthly to exchange information and to 
organize seminars and educational retreats. 
</P>
<P>
In Monrovia, Santoro said he expects his crime-fighting committee to meet at 
least twice a month, and to grow with the addition of representatives from the 
Monrovia Unified School District, social service agencies and the community.

BRETHREN MAKES 2ND TRY FOR CIF CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in its 42-year history, Brethren High School of Paramount 
is in the CIF basketball championship game. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors (19-8), coached by Rich Thomas, will play Faith Baptist (18-10) of 
Canoga Park for the Southern Section 1-A title Friday night at 7:30 at Biola 
University. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, Brethren lost in the finals to Chaminade, 54-52, in two overtimes. 
</P>
<P>
This year's team, which finished in a fourth-place tie in the Olympic League, 
has swept through the playoffs without leading scorer Todd Mitchell, who is 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
But the Warriors have three players averaging in double figures in the playoffs 
-- sophomore Chiron Hart (15.3), junior Brandon Stott (14.8) and senior Chris 
Beck (11.3). 
</P>
<P>
Stott scored 31 points in a 64-63 victory over Chadwick in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Faith Baptist guard Alex Estrada is averaging 19 points and eight assists a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
5-AA Finals 
</P>
<P>
Poly, which will play Lynwood Saturday night at 8:30 at the Los Angeles Sports 
Arena, is in the championship game for the 24th time. 
</P>
<P>
Under Coach Ron Palmer, Poly has won three of its 12 titles, the last in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The Jackrabbits (25-2) have won 18 consecutive games. Their big scorer and 
rebounder is center Willie McGinest. 
</P>
<P>
Lynwood (30-1) is led by Earnest Killum, who averages about 30 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
This game will feature a battle of two excellent point guards -- Michael 
Singleton of Lynwood and Tyus Edney of Poly. 
</P>
<P>
4-AA Finals 
</P>
<P>
Compton (22-6), making its first title appearance in 21 years, will play 
Glendora (25-5) tonight at 8:30 at UC Irvine's Bren Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
In an 86-73 semifinal victory over Edison, the Tarbabes got 33 points and 16 
rebounds from center James Williams. 
</P>
<P>
4-A Finals 
</P>
<P>
"The place will be a madhouse," said Artesia Coach Wayne Merino, referring to 
the Bren Center, where the Pioneers (24-2) play San Marcos of Santa Barbara 
(24-6) tonight at 6:45. 
</P>
<P>
Artesia's All-American center Ed O'Bannon scored 28 points in a 75-45 rout of 
Burroughs of Burbank in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers lost to Dominguez in the title game last year. 
</P>
<P>
Girls 
</P>
<P>
Lynwood (25-1) will try to avenge its only loss of the season when the Knights 
play Morningside (27-3) in the 5-AA title game Friday night at 8:30 at the Bren 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Tbe game should feature a duel between Morningside scoring sensation Lisa 
Leslie and Lynwood star Linda Watson. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Christian (21-4) will play defending champion St. Joseph of Santa Maria 
(24-3) in the 2-A title game tonight a 7:30 at Hancock College in Santa Maria.

ALLEN OUTLINES HIS GAME PLAN FOR IMPROVING 49ERS' FORTUNES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with a myriad of details and more than a few doubts as he attempts to 
vitalize football at Cal State Long Beach, George Allen finds even the 49ers 
uniforms to be frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever designed those uniforms and colors (brown and gold) must have got his 
training in the Soviet Union," Allen said in an austere, cramped office that 
did not seem to befit his stature. 
</P>
<P>
From behind his desk, Allen picked up a helmet of the Washington Redskins, a 
team he once coached. "I designed the Redskins helmet, it's a beautiful 
helmet," he said. "The headdress and three stripes. This one is an inch wide, 
these are three-quarter inch." 
</P>
<P>
He next picked up the colorfully decorated helmet of the Chicago Blitz, which 
he also coached. "I put the Chicago flag on this one," he said. "Does Long 
Beach have a flag? I'd like to get one." 
</P>
<P>
Then he looked with dismay at the plain brown Cal State Long Beach helmet. "I 
mean at least have a stripe on the goddarn thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The helmets and uniforms, Allen said, will be improved without circumventing 
the school's color scheme. 
</P>
<P>
It is too soon, though, for Allen to say if the players who will wear the new 
uniforms will be improved. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers were 4-8 in 1989 and have had one winning season in the last five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, whose record as a pro coach is 118-54-5, was hired in December, a move 
that bathed the university in an unfamiliar national spotlight. He immediately 
showed he had not lost any zest by leading cheers at his introductory press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Now he tries to maintain that level of enthusiasm, despite the 
often-overwhelming scope of his new job and speculation that this 71-year-old, 
perceived by some as eccentric, will never coach a game for the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Allen insists he will. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to make a little money, make a bet on that," he said last week. 
"If this were an easy job, I wouldn't have taken it. I took it because the job 
is the most difficult in Division I." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers football program was plagued throughout the 1980s by poor support, 
low attendance and financial hardship. Allen's predecessor, Larry Reisbig, had 
11 wins and 24 losses in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Allen figures that six "game plans" are needed: winning community backing, 
upgrading facilities, devising fund-raising programs, improving recruiting and 
selling season tickets are the first five. The sixth, he said, might be the 
most important: "You can't let anything discourage you because every day is a 
surprise of some sort." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if there have been any discouraging days so far, Allen said, "Well, maybe 
just one or two, I guess." He laughed. 
</P>
<P>
The person at Cal State Long Beach most familiar with Allen is Merle Makings, 
34, the athletic department's new marketing director. Makings and Allen worked 
together with the Arizona Wranglers of the now-defunct United States Football 
League. 
</P>
<P>
"When (Allen) gets excited, he's as excited as he was before the USFL 
championship game in 1984," said Makings. "He has some temporary setbacks, but 
that's because he is getting accustomed to the system here." 
</P>
<P>
As much as he anticipates his daily runs around the 49ers track, Allen longs 
for the day this spring when he finally will have his team on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"The easiest part of the job is playing the game, coaching on Saturday," he 
said. "It's all these other things -- recruiting, getting support, trying to 
get someone to get going on a new stadium. Right now there are probably 150 
things that I should be doing. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't looked at one film (from last season). That's the least significant 
thing right now because of these other things." 
</P>
<P>
He worries especially about the practice field. When he coached the Wranglers, 
he searched Phoenix's best country clubs to lure a groundskeeper to take care 
of his practice field. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to be cut, it has to be lined," he said. "The sprinklers have to be 
fixed, the holes filled. We have to keep the golfers off the field so they 
don't take divots." 
</P>
<P>
Allen looked at a list of the 25 players he signed; on it are 16 community 
college players and nine players who are seniors in high school. 
</P>
<P>
It was called a "typical Long Beach State recruiting class" by Cal-Hi Sports 
Weekly, a publication that ranks high school and college players. But Dick 
LaScola, who runs a Fallbrook-based scouting service, said Allen "has nothing 
to be ashamed of in that first class." 
</P>
<P>
The last addition to the list was Chris Stetz, a defensive lineman from Allan 
Hancock College in Santa Maria. "I talked to him about eight times," Allen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He paused and said to Makings, "If there's any coffee out there, I'd like a 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
"You want some more water, coach?" Makings asked. 
</P>
<P>
Allen continued: "If we can't stop the run, school is out, and from what I can 
gather they haven't been able here to stop the run. "This guy (Stetz) is only 
19, he's 270 (pounds), bench presses around 400 pounds and he won't make 
mistakes. He'll be on time. He says, 'Yes sir, no sir.' His father graduated 
from the Air Force Academy. 
</P>
<P>
"I have one (assistant) coach who thinks we've got to get a guy who's faster 
than this guy. Well, I've got to educate this coach. The other guy might be 
faster but will he be on time? Will he be in the classroom, will he be loyal, 
will he practice well? Talent alone is not enough." 
</P>
<P>
Stetz's name, along with a lot of others, is chalked on a board in Allen's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"I told an intern coach I wanted him to put all these guys up on the board, 
seniors in orange and juniors in whatever color that is . . . sophomores, 
frosh, all different colors, then put their size and speed, and put stars on 
those who didn't play last year." 
</P>
<P>
Allen scanned the board and said, "We don't have a place-kicker." 
</P>
<P>
It was pointed out by a visitor that there is no experienced quarterback 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we don't," Allen said. "We don't have defensive linemen, offensive 
linemen, a quarterback, a kicker, " Allen said. "Outside of that we're in great 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "I hope there are some pleasant surprises when we go out to field, 
that there are some players who are better than I've been led to believe." 
</P>
<P>
The general impression of Allen seems "incredibly good," said Don Dyer, a Long 
Beach attorney and longtime 49ers fund-raiser. "I'm a little bit amazed. I 
thought it would be more wait and see. I know people who have bought tickets 
who haven't bought them in the recent past." 
</P>
<P>
Dyer has heard the talk that Allen, who has a five-year contract at about 
$100,000 a season, might quit before the opening game at Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some people just wonder how much George knows about the frustration 
level," Dyer said. "Coming from the big time to here is not easy. But I think 
he's in it for the duration." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Severson, a Long Beach realtor who was a defensive back for Allen at 
Washington, said Allen "is working his tail off." 
</P>
<P>
"If he can help us build a stadium and even just be .500 he will have made a 
major contribution no one else has been able to do," said Severson, who played 
at Cal State Long Beach in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the 49ers are stuck with Veterans Stadium, an off-campus 
relic that seats 12,500. 
</P>
<P>
"I think to fill it you've got to win," Allen said. "It will be hard to fill it 
if you get wiped out. If you get wiped out, people will say that the team is 
still the same old team." 
</P>
<P>
Clemson will be a heavy favorite to wipe out the 49ers in Allen's inaugural 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers are playing that game because of a $250,000 guarantee. In recent 
seasons they exchanged embarrassing beatings for big guarantees at Michigan, 
UCLA and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can just play somebody for money," Allen said. "If your team 
plays somebody like (Clemson) and gets a shellacking, it's demoralizing. I 
think this school is definitely 1-A classification, but I think we have to be 
realistic. We have to build a program and get a winning attitude, and it has to 
be a gradual process. By getting a little success in some of the other areas, 
then if you play schools like that, you can make it competitive. I'm no miracle 
worker, it's going to take time." 
</P>
<P>
Allen said he has been putting in "a 40-hour week by Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
This has caused his wife, Etty, to complain. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, she knows I'm kind of nutty," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
But eccentric? 
</P>
<P>
"I think I know what's right and how to do it, and I work hard," Allen said. "I 
expect everyone to be on time, to be in shape, to be dedicated, to be loyal and 
to give 110%. That's eccentric to some people." 
</P>
<P>
Allen has been motivating players with his "110%" spiel since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Among the many telephone calls he made on that morning last week was one that 
went like this: "I'd like to have some workout T-shirts that say '49er 
Football' at the top and below that, '110%' in at least three-inch letters. 
Have them make up some samples for me." 
</P>
<P>
It sounded a little corny, but then it's always worked before.

SHOWDOWN: AFTER AN UNGLAMOROUS CHANNEL LEAGUE SEASON, THE COUGARS ARE IN THE 
SOUTHERN SECTION 4-AA FINAL.

<P>
When a team plays in the shadow of the powerful girls' basketball programs at 
Buena and Santa Barbara highs, it's often difficult to measure success. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Coach Glenn Gray knew his team had talent this year despite a 
less-than-glamorous 15-9 regular-season record and a third-place finish in the 
Channel League. When the Cougars received an at-large berth in the Southern 
Section 4-AA Division playoffs, they wanted to make the most of their chance. 
</P>
<P>
With league foes Buena and Santa Barbara in the 5-A playoffs, Ventura has 
seized the opportunity to show what it can do. The Cougars (19-9) have won four 
consecutive games and suddenly find themselves in the final against top-seeded 
Pasadena Muir (25-5) at 8:30 p.m. Friday at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just happy to make the playoffs," said Gray, in his second year at the 
school. "When we got here, it was our goal to do well. We're a young team, so 
of course we're elated at being in the finals. I guess all of our tough 
competition paid off." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura lost three games to Buena and two to Santa Barbara during the season. 
The Cougars also dropped a pair to Westlake, which eliminated them in the 
second round last year. 
</P>
<P>
Following a 61-34 victory over Bishop Amat in the opening round, Ventura got 
revenge against Westlake, 50-46. It went on to defeat Edison, 55-40, in the 
quarterfinals and Loara, 40-39, in the semifinals. Ventura trailed Loara, 
39-34, with 30 seconds to play before rallying for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing hard basketball has been our motto all season," said Gray, whose son, 
Glenn Gray II, coaches the junior varsity. "We play tough defense. We're not 
big, so we have to rely on our quickness." 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the team is 5-foot-7 guard/forward Cori Herman, a junior averaging 
16.5 points a game. The rest of the lineup includes 5-foot-7 guards Andrew 
Williams and Wendy Ward, 5-foot-9 forward Denise Rea (10 points) and 5-10 
center Nicole Carroll. Ward and Rea are sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
Muir is in the final for the fifth time in the past seven years. It lost to 
Katella, 54-48, in the championship game last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly didn't expect to be playing Ventura for the title," said Muir Coach 
Mel Sims, whose team won the Pacific League with a 9-1 record. "I don't know 
anything about their team or any of their players. We don't scout games, so 
we'll just stick to our normal game plan and hope that works. It normally 
does." 
</P>
<P>
Muir is much bigger than Ventura, with 6-1 forward Linda Armstong leading the 
way. Armstrong (14.5 points a game) receives plenty of support from 5-10 
forward Karen Banks (13.5), 6-1 center Josie Pacheco (12.5), 5-2 guard Rose 
Jong (8.5 and 10.1 assists) and 5-9 guard Taunya Johnson (6.5 points). 
</P>
<P>
Other playoff games involving Ventura County teams include: 
</P>
<P>
Buena (26-0) vs. Hart (24-4), 6:45 p.m. Friday, UC Irvine Bren Center, girls' 
5-A championship: This is a rematch of last year's 5-A semifinal game, which 
Hart won, 78-68. The Indians went on to win the championship with a 63-49 
victory over Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances are a bit different this season. Buena is undefeated and the 
top seed in the division. The Bulldogs easily defeated Hart, 48-30, in the 
semifinals of the Simi Valley tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure Hart is a better team than they were earlier this season," said Buena 
Coach Joe Vaughan, who is 352-29 in 15 seasons at the school. "They have 
outstanding athletes and we will have to do a good job to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
Buena features a balanced attack. The statistical leader is 5-11 senior center 
Nicole Ellis, who is averaging 13 points and nine rebounds. Mia Palkie, a 5-8 
junior guard, adds 10 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Hart is under the direction of first-year Coach Dave Munroe, who was an 
assistant for the boys' team from 1977-87. 
</P>
<P>
Munroe looked to 6-3 senior center Sara Wilson to provide the leadership on a 
team made up mostly of younger players. The Oregon-bound Wilson is averaging 19 
points and 12 rebounds. The biggest surprise is 5-7 sophomore guard Anjanette 
Dionne, who leads the team with a 23-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara (23-0) vs. Verbum Dei (14-12), 11:30 a.m. Saturday, Sports Arena, 
boys' 2-AA championship: Santa Clara, the defending 2-A champion, has been No. 
1 all season and is the top seed. The Saints have breezed through the playoffs 
with victories over Pius X, Chaminade and Tehachapi. 
</P>
<P>
Verbum Dei has been impressive in playoff wins over Twentynine Palms, Santa 
Margarita, and Banning. 
</P>
<P>
Shon Tarver, Santa Clara's 6-5 senior guard, is averaging 31 points a game.

ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: CRAWFORD PROVIDES SPARK IN MOORPARK VICTORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By STEVE HENSON

<TEXT>
<P>
His shots weren't falling as frequently in a first-round Southern California 
regional game as they had in his previous outing, but Sam Crawford couldn't 
have been more pleased. 
</P>
<P>
His team was winning. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark went on to defeat Orange Coast, 75-64, Saturday night and advance to 
the second round of the state playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-8 freshman point guard is a flashy, explosive player who is toiling 
in junior college only because he couldn't qualify academically for a Division 
I scholarship. He scored the last seven points in the game and finished with a 
game-high 20 points and 12 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford broke the single-season assist record for Moorpark (22-10), led the 
Western State Conference by averaging 12 assists and was second in the 
conference with a 20.4 point average. 
</P>
<P>
In the final regular-season game Feb. 17 against Ventura, Crawford scored a 
school-record 49 points. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, a suburban junior college, and Crawford, a city kid from Westchester 
High, have made a successful, if unlikely, alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it here," he said. "I'd rather be at a four-year school but, having to 
do this, this is probably the best place for me." STEVE HENSON

FIVE UCLA SWIMMERS AMONG THE FAVORITES IN PAC-10 MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA men's swim team (9-4 in dual meets and 3-2 against Pacific 10 
Conference opponents) will vie with powers Stanford, California and USC in the 
Pac-10 championships today through Saturday at the Belmont Plaza Pool in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier dual meets, the Bruins defeated the Cardinal and Cal but lost to the 
Trojans, 69-44. 
</P>
<P>
Five UCLA swimmers are among the favorites in their events. Bruin All-American 
sophomores Brian Kurza and Andrea Cecchi will defend their championships in the 
50-yard freestyle and 100 breast-stroke, respectively. Cecchi also is one of 
the top entrants in the 200 breast-stroke. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA All-American senior Mark Dean will be hard to beat in the 200 butterfly. 
Dean has a 14-1 record in that event in dual meets during the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin freshman Geoff Cronin, who won the U.S. Swimming Long Course 100-meter 
backstroke last summer, could beat the pack in the 100-yard and 200 backstroke 
events. UCLA All-American senior Rodrigo Gonzalez, a 1988 Olympian for Mexico, 
is rated highly in the 200 individual medley. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA should earn points in the 400 freestyle relay and the 400 medley relay. 
</P>
<P>
In the conference diving championship held last week, UCLA's Chris Dudka and 
Dave Fleck combined for 94 points as the Bruins edged second-place Stanford by 
one point and third-place Arizona State by two. 
</P>
<P>
Dudka, a sophomore transfer from the University of South Carolina, won the 
three-meter event with a score of 551.40. Fleck was sixth with 454.20. Dudka 
was second on the one-meter board and in platform, while Fleck finished sixth 
and fifth, respectively, in those two events. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA women's swim team (7-2 in dual meets) will be the host team for the 
Bruin Invitational, which starts at noon Saturday at the UCLA men's gymnasium 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Stanford won its fourth consecutive Pac-10 championship with 1,717 
points, and UCLA finished third at 1,143. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin sophomore Kris Stoudt set a new conference record with a 49.93 in the 100 
freestyle and a school record with a 54.72 in the 100 butterfly and won the 50 
freestyle in 23.36. She qualified for the NCAA meet in each race. 
</P>
<P>
Other UCLA qualifiers for the NCAA were Jeanne Gibbons in the 200 freestyle and 
the 200 and 800 freestyle and 400 medley relay teams. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA women's basketball team, which has won six of its last seven games, 
will be aiming for its first NCAA tournament bid since 1985 when it plays 
tonight at Washington State (13-11, 5-9 in the Pac-10) and Saturday night at 
seventh-ranked Washington (22-2, 13-1). 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins (16-9, 11-4) hope to win two of their last three games and earn an 
at-large bid. UCLA will finish the regular season by playing host to USC at 7 
p.m. March 8 at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Sandra VanEmbricqs was named conference player of the week after she 
led UCLA to a 74-55 win over Oregon State and a 79-65 victory over Oregon. 
Against the Ducks, VanEmbricqs scored 22 points and had 14 rebounds, Michelle 
Wootton had 17 points and 10 rebounds, and Rehema Stephens added 12 points and 
10 rebounds. Van Embricqs has scored in double figures in 11 of her last 12 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The third-ranked UCLA men's volleyball team (12-1 overall and 7-1 in the 
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn.) will play host to No. 2 USC (9-3, 
5-1) at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Bruins held off Pepperdine in five games and defeated Cal State 
Northridge in four. Against the Waves, Oren Sher had a season-high 24 kills, 
Rich Bland had 14 kills, five digs and five blocks, and Trevor Schirman had 
seven blocks. In the Northridge match, Bland had 17 kills, Sher had 15 kills 
and six blocks and Schirman added a season-high 16 blocks.

<P>
Last week the Bruin women won the UCLA/Los Angeles Times invitational with 
191.45 points. Other scores: Cal State Fullerton, 187.95; Penn State, 187, and 
New Mexico, 184.20. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA senior Jill Andrews set new meet records and career-best marks as she won 
the all-around title with a 39.05 and the vault with a 9.95. Andrews also won 
the beam with a 9.70 and floor exercise with a 9.80. Bruin junior Renee Kelly 
had a career-best 9.70 in floor exercise. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruin men (10-2) were upset last week at Stanford, 276.25 to 274.95. Three 
UCLA performers took firsts: senior Chris Waller with a 9.65 in the pommel

PEPPERDINE HUNTS CONFERENCE CROWN; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: THE WAVES, RED HOT OVER THE LAST FEW GAMES, WILL FACE ST. 
MARY'S IN THE WEST COAST CONFERENCE OPENER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Pepperdine's basketball team was struggling midway through the season, 
Coach Tom Asbury said that the West Coast Conference tournament was good 
because it gives every team a chance for redemption. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves, who came in second in the conference to nationally ranked Loyola 
Marymount, don't need to redeem themselves any longer. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine has won three straight games and nine of its last 11, including an 
upset victory over nationally ranked WCC champion Loyola Marymount. The Waves 
finished the regular season at 16-11 overall and 10-4 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the teams that Pepperdine will or may face in the first two rounds of 
the WCC tournament has a great need for vindication, however, and each has 
nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine will meet St. Mary's (7-19, 4-10) in the first round at 6 p.m. 
Saturday at Loyola's Gersten Pavilion. If the Waves win, they will play the 
winner of Saturday night's first-round game between the University of San 
Francisco (8-19, 4-10) and the University of San Diego (14-12 as the week 
began, 9-5) in a semifinal game at 7 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's, USF and San Diego have each lost twice to Pepperdine in conference 
play this season, and each has something to prove against the Waves. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said that it is difficult to beat a team three 
times in one season and that his players can't afford to take its first- or 
second-round opponents lightly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough playing anybody three times, especially anybody that you have 
beaten," Asbury said. "That's not always a good situation, but it's better than 
putting your bags away. "Anything can happen in a tournament. I don't think our 
guys can look past anybody." 
</P>
<P>
He remembers when the sneaker was on the other foot. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 Pepperdine finished seventh in the conference but upset both 
second-place Gonzaga and regular-season champion USD in the first two rounds of 
the tournament. The Waves lost in the tournament final to Santa Clara, which 
finished fifth in the WCC in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine ended 1987 with only a 12-18 overall record, but it also finished 
with a bang-bang in the tournament before losing the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Underdog teams in conference tournaments, Asbury said, are "like 0-0 and as 
loose as they can be -- and they can be dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's doesn't appear dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Paul Landreaux's Gaels have lost eight of their last nine games, have 
used 13 different starting line-ups this season and have played only four games 
with a full roster because of injuries and illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's will probably be without its leading scorer, senior forward James 
Dailey, who has missed the last seven games with a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
One starter, senior guard-forward Terry Burns, missed 14 games because of a 
ruptured disc in his back. Burns has returned, but he is still not considered 
completely healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Bamberger, a 6-10 sophomore center, has returned to the starting lineup 
after missing four games because of mononucleosis. 
</P>
<P>
Landreaux expects to use two of three freshmen at the forward positions. John 
Levitt, a 6-foot-5 native of Juneau, Alaska, will start at one forward spot, 
and either 6-7 Ted Bull or 6-7 Demetreus Robbins at the other. 
</P>
<P>
The other starter will be senior point guard Mike Vontoure, the team's 
second-leading scorer after Dailey, who was averaging 12.6 points a game. 
Vontoure is averaging 12.4 points and Bamberger is at 12.3. 
</P>
<P>
The Gaels have been deeply wounded, but remember that old saw about wounded 
animals being the most dangerous of all. 
</P>
<P>
Vontoure is a good shooter from three-point range, and Levitt isn't bad. 
Through 23 games, Levitt was leading all conference freshmen in scoring with an 
average of 8.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
In his first game since his illness, Bamberger scored 23 points and had 11 
rebounds in last week's 83-80 upset over Portland in overtime. In last 
Saturday's 75-62 loss to Gonzaga, Bamberger scored 18 points, all in the first 
half, before he tired and ran into foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Landreaux, the former El Camino College head coach and UCLA assistant, said 
that the Gaels "are a lot better team with Bamberger in the middle than with 
(6-8 freshman) Danny White." 
</P>
<P>
He also saw a ray of hope in the tournament's final seedings. "We might match 
up a little bit better against Pepperdine than against San Diego," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Upsets are always possible, but the Waves have been playing very well lately 
and appear to be much too strong for St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
Wave senior forward Dexter Howard, used mostly to provide spark off the bench 
this season, has been almost unstoppable as a starter in the last six games. In 
that stretch, he has averaged 26 points, including a career-high 35 points in 
the 131-123 upset of Loyola. He leads the Waves with a 17.6-point average. 
</P>
<P>
The other Wave starters have also been scoring in double figures and have also 
played well lately. 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward Tom Lewis and senior guard Craig Davis are each averaging about 
14.5 points a game, sophomore center Geoff Lear is averaging 13.7 points and a 
team-high 8.9 rebounds and senior guard Shann Ferch is averaging 10.8 points. 
Davis leads the team with a 47.2% average on three-point shots, and Ferch is 
shooting 44.1% on triples. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves may also have too much firepower for San Diego, if the Toreros get 
past USF. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego was trailing Pepperdine, 57-43, at halftime last Saturday, a half in 
which the Waves made 10 of 13 three-pointers (76.9%) and shot 61.3% from the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
But the Toreros, led by the inside scoring of forward John Jerome and the 
outside scoring of guard Pat Holbert, didn't quit, cutting the lead to three 
points three times in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Holbert finished with a team-high 27 points and Jerome added 23 points, but the 
Waves won, 102-89. 
</P>
<P>
A rematch between Pepperdine and USD in the tournament would probably be much 
closer. 
</P>
<P>
If form holds, Pepperdine and Loyola will meet in the title game, but could the 
Waves play with as much emotion on the Lions' home court as they did when they 
beat the Lions at Firestone Fieldhouse? 
</P>
<P>
Asbury thinks so. He said that he wishes that the tournament championship game 
could be played "other than on their floor." But he added: 
</P>
<P>
"I think the emotion is something we can recapture, especially when the NCAA 
tournament is at the end of the tunnel. There is certainly a lot at stake, 
certainly enough for us to get emotional." 
</P>
<P>
If Loyola should run to form and beat the Waves in the final, Asbury said he 
thinks his team still would merit consideration for the National Invitation 
Tournament. Pepperdine has gone to the NIT for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
"If we lost in the (tournament) final, we would be 18-12, and last year (after 
the conference tournament) we were 19-12," he said. "I'd say we would have to 
be looked at pretty closely (by the NIT), especially finishing as strongly as 
we did."

TOUBA, Senegal 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From a dusty roundabout 100 miles or so from the coast of West Africa, an 
immense white minaret beckons in the haze. A gendarme clad in khaki approaches 
a visitor's car. 
</P>
<P>
"No cigarettes? No alcohol?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
Satisfied that the occupants had left any such contraband behind, he waved them 
on -- and they proceeded into one of the most extraordinary cities in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
This is Touba, a combination Vatican City and Mecca for the millions of 
followers of the Islamic Mouride Brotherhood, perhaps the most politically 
potent of the traditional organizations in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
It is here that the sect safeguards the writings of its founder, the sainted 
Amadou Bamba. Across the street from the Touba mosque, whose minaret is the 
tallest in black Africa, a thriving agricultural and trading enterprise is 
centralized under the umbrella of the vast religious brotherhood. 
</P>
<P>
Touba is a sort of state within a state. Senegal's police and customs officers 
have little or no authority here, and it is said that making the Grand Magal, 
or annual pilgrimage, to Touba is the next best thing to going to Mecca. Last 
October, more than a million Mourides clogged the roads into the city for the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
In a bare room in his family compound just outside the city, Sheik Abdou Kadre 
Mbacke, the caliph general of the Mourides and the oldest surviving son of 
Amadou Bamba, fingers the folds of his embroidered orange scarf and the scent 
of sweet perfume wafts across the air. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not here for politics but to provide spiritual guidance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Modest words. The caliph general is one of the most important of the marabouts, 
the religious leaders who exercise spiritual and secular authority unmatched by 
traditional leaders elsewhere in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every African country retains the vestiges of the ancient kingdoms 
and principalities that were the political and religious jurisdictions of 
pre-colonial times. But everywhere else the traditional authorities have either 
disappeared or been reduced to cat's-paws of powerful central governments. 
</P>
<P>
In Nigeria, for example, when a vacancy arose last year in its most important 
traditional seat, the Sultanate of Sokoto, President Ibrahim Babangida 
stage-managed the succession in order to place his own candidate in the post. 
Then he restricted the new sultan to his palace, lest he exacerbate 
Muslim-Christian tension in the disputatious country. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing like that happens in Senegal, where political authority tends to flow 
the other way. The marabouts exercise power as heads of the predominantly 
Muslim country's many brotherhoods, or confreries. It is a rare Senegalese who 
does not identify himself as a disciple of one or another of these religious 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians prepare for elections by making a pilgrimage to key marabouts, all 
of whom live in remote rural districts. Those in power make sure the 
brotherhoods' secular needs are met in return for political support. 
</P>
<P>
How this works was illustrated in 1988 when President Abdou Diouf faced a stiff 
challenge from opposition candidate Abdoulaye Wade. Even though Wade was a 
Mouride and Diouf was not, the Mouride caliph general went on radio to warn 
followers that any who did not vote for Diouf's reelection would "not come face 
to face" with the sect's sainted founder in the afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
Diouf won handily. (The caliph died last year and was succeeded by his oldest 
surviving brother, Sheik Abdou Kadre.) 
</P>
<P>
Some observers think the marabouts might function as obstacles to the rise here 
of Islamic fundamentalism, in part because their influence over the country, 
which is 90% Muslim, is so extensive. 
</P>
<P>
"The fundamentalists are merely intellectuals," Babacar Toure, publisher of the 
weekly journal Sud-Hebdo, told a recent visitor. "The marabout is a cultural 
and intellectual institution. The brotherhoods will be the gravediggers of any 
fundamentalist attempt to gain power here." 
</P>
<P>
Any battle between the two forces would be a bitter one. Fundamentalists 
disapprove of the worldliness of Mouride and other marabouts, as well as the 
extent to which they exploit their followers' labor on their personal farms and 
extract personal gifts. 
</P>
<P>
They also disapprove of some of the beliefs that Bamba has spawned. Experts say 
that Bamba's writings are an unremarkable digest of orthodox Islamic beliefs 
but that the cult that has grown around him is something else. 
</P>
<P>
It is a rare Mouride who cannot recite legends such as the one about Bamba 
surviving a long period in a cell with a hungry lion. It is said that after he 
was refused permission to pray by the captain of the French ship taking him to 
political exile in Gabon in 1895, he flung his prayer mat overboard and prayed 
atop the waves. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, fundamentalism has been kept at bay in Senegal, at least as far as 
the brotherhoods are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
When the matter was raised with Alioune Ndaw, director of the Touba library, he 
asserted: "How many fundamentalists are there in the country? Maybe just three 
or four." 
</P>
<P>
The brotherhoods' importance in Senegalese life is rooted in the land's 
colonial history. When the French destroyed the native Wolof kingdoms in the 
late 19th Century, they extinguished a social and economic structure, leaving a 
gap that was filled by the brotherhoods. 
</P>
<P>
And the brotherhoods offered more than religious succor. In time, they began to 
offer security as well. One worked for or presented gifts to one's marabout; in 
return, the marabout provided financial assistance at times of sickness or 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
The marabouts' authority was not lost on the French, who turned to them for 
assistance in running their new colony. In the 1950s, the marabouts helped 
Leopold Sedar Senghor, a Roman Catholic, to win in the fierce infighting that 
characterized Senegalese politics just before independence. Senghor led the 
country until he retired in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Of Senghor's supporters, perhaps the most important were the Mourides. In 
Senegal, no other brotherhood approaches their level of influence. They are not 
the biggest brotherhood, or the oldest. The Tidjiane and Qadiriyya have twice 
as many followers and trace their history to ancient times, while Amadou Bamba 
died in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
But individually and collectively, the Mourides are the richest and most 
dynamic. Followers of Mouridism trace their spirit of enterprise directly to 
Bamba, who is said to have greeted new disciples with the simple directive, "Go 
and work." 
</P>
<P>
Today they dominate the country's transport industry -- it is a rare bus or 
bush taxi that is not decorated with the word Touba or a drawing of a minaret 
-- along with the urban real estate business and the largest market in Dakar. 
The peanut industry, until recently Senegal's No. 1 export earner, is largely 
in Mouride hands. 
</P>
<P>
The Mourides' dabblings in politics have also paid off. Mouride marabouts 
control considerable patronage, and this tends to enhance their standing among 
their disciples. The Mouride holy city is so well served by modern public roads 
that in the words of one commentator, "Touba looks on a road map as if it might 
be the country's capital." 
</P>
<P>
The Mouride glorification of labor has been an important stabilizing force in 
the country, but Mouride agriculture is another story. When the French 
introduced the peanut to central Senegal, the marabouts took to the new crop 
with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
Mouride farms, which were owned by marabouts and worked by their disciples 
generally without pay, were devoted entirely to the peanut. Great numbers of 
trees were taken down, and this, coupled with concentration on a single crop, 
has devastated the land. A French agronomist visiting the area remarked that 
Touba's magnificent mosque "dominated . . . a desert artificially created by 
human hands." 
</P>
<P>
Today, attempts by international aid donors to force Senegal into streamlining 
its inefficient peanut processing and marketing system have to reckon with 
Mouride opposition. 
</P>
<P>
A World Bank official in Dakar said the institution has been trying in vain for 
years to make the Senegalese shut down one of four under-used peanut-oil 
factories but, unfortunately, the best candidate for mothballs is in the heart 
of the central Mouride zone. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the government does get its way occasionally. For example, a ban on 
alcohol and tobacco in Touba only appears to have its roots in the Muslim 
tradition of abstention. The reality is much different -- and says much more 
about modern Mourides. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, Touba was a wide-open city. "You could buy anything there," a 
government official said, "from an AK-47 to a 747." Liquor was so common that 
"it was a means of exchange," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The city was a huge entrepot for goods smuggled in from neighboring Gambia. 
Criminals knew that authorities were barred from the city and fled to it when 
pursued. Touba youths used drugs that were freely available, and public 
drunkenness was a scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city's unsavory reputation was disturbing to many mid-level 
marabouts, it was overlooked by the caliph general. Then the present caliph 
general, who at the time was serving as imam, or holy man, of the Touba mosque, 
was assaulted on a street, and by the early 1980s the marabouts had become 
receptive to a government plan to clean up the city. 
</P>
<P>
The contraband market was disbanded -- although plenty of smuggled goods are 
still available and much of the illicit profits go into the marabouts' pockets. 
The Senegalese police now have the right to pursue malefactors into the city. 
The ban on alcohol and tobacco is enforced at the city gate. 
</P>
<P>
And there are other changes, not all of them good for the status of the 
marabouts. For one thing, the religious leaders' long involvement in politics 
is beginning to strain relations with their followers. 
</P>
<P>
Many Mourides believe that the caliph's 1988 election order was a major error, 
in that it gave increasingly disaffected urban Mourides a strong grievance. 
</P>
<P>
"It created something of a movement of dissent," Dakar Mouride, a librarian, 
said. Many resented the caliph's intrusion into a secular matter. "I abstained 
from voting at all," the librarian said, "and I wasn't the only one." 
</P>
<P>
Some say the caliph's mistake was not in ordering the vote for Diouf but in 
misreading the changing times. 
</P>
<P>
"Caliphs had (given orders) as explicit in the past," Donal Cruise O'Brien, a 
British authority on Mouridism, has observed. "What's new is the climate of 
opinion, rather than the deed." 
</P>
<P>
The new caliph general is believed to be less politically interested than his 
late brother and not likely to make the same mistake. But other forces may be 
weakening the marabouts' grip on the country. Certainly Senegal's economic 
crisis has reduced the marabouts' ability to help their increasingly straitened 
followers. In the countryside, complaints are heard about the difficulty a poor 
man has getting in to see his marabout. 
</P>
<P>
"If you arrive with only your faith, you are ignored," said a man who took part 
in a religious debate last year in the town of Thies. "But if you drive up in a 
big American car, the marabout welcomes you." 
</P>
<P>
The result is something of a fundamentalist eruption in itself, in which the 
marabouts' importance as intermediaries is jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is best to return to the original conceptions of Amadou Bamba 
himself," Abdoulaye Sylla, a newspaper editor and devout Mouride, said. "If the 
marabout engages in political fights, he will lose his influence. As Amadou 
Bamba said, 'It is the people who produce religion, through their work.' "

U.S. SLIPS BADLY IN INFANT MORTALITY FIGHT, PANEL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Progress in reducing the infant mortality rate in the United States has ground 
nearly to a halt, a national panel reported Wednesday. And it said the 
"mortality gap" between black and white babies is the widest it has been since 
the country began keeping track in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
The National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality found that the United 
States has fallen to 20th place among developed countries in the race to cut 
infant deaths. Japan has leaped from 17th to first place, with only half the 
U.S. rate of 10.1 deaths per 1,000 live births. 
</P>
<P>
Cities such as Washington, D.C., with a rate of 19.3 deaths per 1,000 live 
births, and Philadelphia, with a rate of 17.3, have become "infant mortality 
disaster areas" with rates rivaling those of the Third World, according to the 
report. Babies born in Jamaica and Costa Rica are more likely to live to see 
their first birthday than babies born in those cities. (Los Angeles' rate is 
10.5 deaths per 1,000 births.) 
</P>
<P>
"These trends provide a strong indicator that infant mortality will worsen in 
the years ahead, especially as more communities feel the impact of increased 
poverty among children, drugs and fewer health-care providers serving high-risk 
families," the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
The discouraging trends in infant mortality are widely attributed to shrinking 
access for lower-income women to prenatal and pediatric care, as well as the 
rising numbers of women using drugs and alcohol during pregnancy or carrying 
infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
The Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality, formed by Congress three years ago, 
called upon the government and private industry to guarantee universal access 
to early maternity and pediatric care, just as the United States acted in 1965 
to guarantee medical care for the elderly through the Medicare program. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also urged the country to "make the health and well-being of 
mothers and infants a national priority," not simply making services available 
but aggressively reaching out to make sure they are known and used. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an area in which we don't know what to do," said former U.S. Sen. 
Lawton Chiles, the commission chairman, in a telephone interview. "Prenatal 
care, early developmental care -- these things work. And they're 
cost-effective." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Congress passed legislation that would have set up demonstration 
projects to explore innovative ways of encouraging prenatal and pediatric care. 
But, faced with a tight budget, it opted not to allocate money for the program. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a lesson to us that when push comes to shove, the Congress will go 
only so far," said Rae Grad, executive director of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have not been able to get it clearly across . . . that the money 
we're talking about spending will promote savings," said Chiles. "We're paying 
for all this now -- in increased prisons, welfare payments, dropout numbers and 
babies having babies." 
</P>
<P>
A nation's infant mortality rate -- the rate at which children die in the first 
year of life -- is considered significant not only in itself, but as a 
sensitive measure of the health and well-being of the population at large. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, 105 infants die each day. Nearly 39,000 of the 3.8 
million babies born each year die by age 1. The U.S. infant death rate of 10.1 
per 1,000 live births is worse than that of Ireland, Spain, East Germany and 16 
other countries. 
</P>
<P>
In its report to Congress, the commission compiled the latest national, 
international, state and local figures on infant mortality. It also examined 
related trends in so-called low birth-weight births -- babies born weighing 
under 5 1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's findings dramatically illustrate the slowing of progress in 
combatting infant deaths made in the United States during the 1950s, '60s and 
'70s, and the growth of what the commission calls "the unconscionable gap" 
between rates for blacks and whites. 
</P>
<P>
The findings include: 
</P>
<P>
* The rate of decline in the infant mortality rate in the United States slowed 
from 4.7% a year in the 1970s to 2.7% a year in the 1980s. Since the 1950s, the 
United States has dropped from sixth to 20th place in the quest to cut the 
infant death rate. 
</P>
<P>
* The percentage of infants born at low birth weight stalled at 6.8% throughout 
the 1980s after dropping steadily from 8% to 7% during the 1970s. In 1987, the 
most recent year for which national figures exist, the rate crept ominously 
upward to 6.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Low birth weight contributes to infant death and disability. Low birth-weight 
infants are 40 times more likely to die during the first month of life, and two 
to three times as likely to be disabled by such conditions as blindness, 
deafness and mental retardation. 
</P>
<P>
* Black babies are now more than twice as likely as whites to die, and more 
than three times as likely to be born at less than 3 1/4 pounds. The gap 
between white and black infant mortality rates has expanded steadily and is now 
the widest ever recorded. 
</P>
<P>
"The reasons for the large and growing disparity between the health of black 
and white infants are not entirely understood," the report said. "Researchers 
cite many factors such as access to preventive health services, economic 
considerations and unhealthy life styles." 
</P>
<P>
* The incidence of newborns exposed to drugs in the uterus quadrupled between 
1985 and 1989, the commission found. The number of babies born to unmarried 
women in 1987 -- 933,013 infants -- was 40% higher than in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
* Between 1980 and 1987, the percentage of women getting late or no prenatal 
care increased 26% for blacks and 17% for whites. In 1987, more than 74,000 
pregnant women received no prenatal care at all. That represented a 50% rise 
over the 1980 rate. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 800 U.S. counties have no clinics offering prenatal care. States report 
that up to 75% of family physicians have stopped delivering babies since 1980. 
"In sum, the maternity care delivery system is failing those pregnant women 
most at risk," the report found. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) responded to the report by introducing legislation 
Wednesday that would require states by 1993 to provide Medicaid coverage for 
pregnant women and infants in families with an annual income of up to 185% of 
the poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
The current level is 133%. (California already covers women and children in 
families with incomes of up to 200% of the poverty level under the state's 
Medi-Cal program for the poor.) 
</P>
<P>
"It is unacceptable that in America today, infant mortality is higher than in 
all other industrialized nations," Bradley said. ". . . A country that can put 
men on the moon and can dream of sending men to Mars can surely find ways to 
add ounces to the birth weight of newborns."

<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that could finally end the war with the Contras, Nicaraguan President 
Daniel Ortega decreed an immediate halt to offensive operations by the 
Sandinista army Wednesday, two months before he is to leave office. 
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire came hours after Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who upset Ortega 
in Sunday's presidential election, joined the Sandinista government in urging 
the U.S.-backed guerrillas to disarm at once and return to civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
"The president has decided to order a unilateral halt to offensive military 
operations with the aim that the counterrevolutionary forces demobilize 
immediately," a message from Ortega's office said. 
</P>
<P>
He urged the United States to cut all aid to the rebels and asked Honduras to 
close rebel camps in its territory. U.S. military aid to the Contras ended two 
years ago, but Congress continued to fund "humanitarian aid" for the rebels. 
That aid ran out Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sandinista troops have waged an offensive against about 3,000 Contras inside 
Nicaragua since Ortega ended a 19-month-old cease-fire last Nov. 1. Because the 
rebels never officially renounced the cease-fire, Ortega's decision restored a 
mutual suspension of hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
The quick succession of events indicated that a final settlement of the war, 
which has claimed about 30,000 lives in eight years, is a priority of both the 
defeated incumbent and the president-elect and could be one of the first fruits 
of Chamorro's stunning electoral victory. 
</P>
<P>
That prospect appeared to gain Wednesday when the Contras expressed a 
willingness to negotiate with Chamorro on their insistence on keeping their 
arms until her government takes effective control of the army and security 
forces from the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
A rebel spokesman in Honduras, Alejandro Acevedo, said the Contras prefer to 
remain intact as a fighting force to ensure that Ortega hands over power as 
scheduled on April 25. "But under the right conditions, we would be willing to 
demobilize sooner," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"All the repressive structures that caused this war have to disappear," he 
said. "Violeta has magnificent intentions, but up against a totalitarian regime 
it takes more than good intentions. It takes deeds and real guarantees. 
Thousands of lives are in play." 
</P>
<P>
Acevedo said that the rebel high command, which met Wednesday in Tegucigalpa, 
the Honduran capital, set up a commission to meet with Chamorro's 14-party 
National Opposition Union (UNO) and press their conditions for disarming. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Cesar, a former Contra leader who became Chamorro's chief campaign 
strategist, confirmed that informal contacts with the rebels are under way. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro broadcast her appeal to the rebels Tuesday night after Ortega, in a 
speech to thousands of Sandinista militants, made the rebels' disarmament a 
prime condition for a "peaceful transfer" of power to her coalition. She said: 
"The causes of this civil war have disappeared. There is no reason for more 
war." 
</P>
<P>
At her first news conference as president-elect on Wednesday, Chamorro called 
the cease-fire "a step forward in the reconstruction of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Rebel spokesman Acevedo also welcomed Ortega's decision to resume the 
cease-fire but said the rebels will urge international observers to monitor it. 
The day after the election, rebel commanders ordered their forces inside 
Nicaragua to avoid combat, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Contra war, which has battered the economy and divided Nicaraguans, began 
three years after the Sandinista guerrillas overthrew the Somoza dictatorship 
in 1979. The Contras have lost strength since Congress cut their military aid, 
but about 10,000 are still in arms, most of them in Honduras, held together in 
part by food and other non-military supplies from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Under a Central American peace accord signed last August in Tela, Honduras, the 
rebels were to turn their arms over to a task force of observers from the 
United Nations and Organization of American States so that Nicaragua's 
elections could proceed peacefully. It also committed both sides to a 
cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
But after the rebels refused to lay down their arms, Ortega ordered his army 
last Nov. 1 to resume the offensive, ending a cease-fire that had held since 
March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At her news conference, Chamorro said that when Ortega visited her home Monday 
to concede defeat, she chided him over his decision last year to resume the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, Daniel, if you had complied with your commitments at Tela, you would 
have won (the election)," she recalled telling him. "You didn't end the war, so 
now we have to do it ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
But Chamorro's aides admit that it will not be easy for her, either. While she 
identified with the Contra cause, and one of her sons served briefly as a 
Contra civilian leader, rebel military leaders view her with suspicion, fearing 
that she might prove too weak and allow the Sandinistas to keep too much power, 
especially in the army. 
</P>
<P>
A final settlement of the Contra war has become entwined with negotiations 
between UNO and the Sandinistas over the army's future. The Sandinistas have 
said they will resist any changes in the army unless the war ends, but the 
Contras want to see changes before they disarm. 
</P>
<P>
Cesar, the UNO strategist, said one solution might be for the Contras in 
Honduras to surrender their arms now to a U.N. peace-keeping force being set up 
there but remain in their border camps until they are satisfied with conditions 
in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Honduran President Rafael Leonardo Callejas, called Tuesday 
for the Contras to disband and leave his country quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Talks between an UNO transition team and a Sandinista delegation led by Gen. 
Humberto Ortega, the president's brother, are to start this week. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro made it clear Wednesday that she will remove Gen. Ortega as defense 
minister and replace him with a civilian. She has also pledged to abolish 
compulsory military service as one of her first official acts, depoliticize the 
70,000-member army and reduce it "according to the economic capacity and social 
needs of the country." 
</P>
<P>
While the Sandinistas have characterized the transition talks as negotiations, 
Chamorro insisted that those plans are not negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
"According to the constitution of the republic, it is I who will rule from now 
on," she declared. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently to avoid conflict with the Sandinistas, however, her advisers have 
decided recently that the army will not be reduced below the levels of other 
Central American armies and that former Contras will not be incorporated unless 
they disarm, accept amnesty and join up like any other volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chamorro has vowed to declare a general amnesty that would make 
Sandinista soldiers and police officers immune from prosecution for any crimes 
committed during the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Cesar said Chamorro's government will control the army through civilian 
management of a reduced military budget. But other opposition goals, such as 
removing Sandinista military instruction and diversifying foreign military aid, 
would have to be negotiated with a Sandinista officer corps that would remain 
mostly intact, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all officers above the rank of captain are Sandinistas who fought as 
guerrillas against the Somoza dictatorship in the 1960s and 1970s. Sandinista 
nationalist ideology is part of basic training. The army is not only the 
Sandinistas' power base but a testing ground for new militants. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview late last year, Col. Oswaldo Lacayo, a member of Gen. Ortega's 
staff, conceded that while the army is dominated by Sandinistas, it could 
evolve into a truly national army "with the participation of all patriotic 
sectors." But he warned that if the opposition came to power and adopted an 
"anti-popular program," such as reversing the Sandinista land-reform program, 
the army would resist.

BONN READY TO ASSURE POLES ON POSTWAR BORDERS 
</P>

<P>
Under mounting pressure both at home and abroad, the West German government 
said Wednesday that it is ready to offer new, formal assurances that a 
reunified Germany would make no territorial claims against Poland. 
</P>
<P>
After a Cabinet meeting in Bonn, deputy government spokesman Dieter Vogel said 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is prepared to back a plan in which the parliaments of 
both West and East Germany would pass declarations pledging the sanctity of the 
present East German-Polish border. 
</P>
<P>
Such a joint resolution could come immediately after East Germans elect their 
first democratic legislature of the post-World War II era on March 18, Vogel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has considerable understanding for what the Poles want," Vogel added of 
Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
Both East and West Germany have treaties with Poland that reaffirm the present 
border, and Kohl backed a similar West German parliamentary resolution last 
fall before a visit to Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
However, his visible reluctance to clarify German intentions on the emotive 
question since reunification suddenly emerged as a near-term reality several 
weeks ago has unsettled Europeans and dismayed many Germans. 
</P>
<P>
Polish government officials, expressing fears that a reunified Germany might 
some day argue that the treaties are invalid because they were signed by 
nations no longer in existence, have gone so far as to ask that Soviet troops 
stay in Poland to help guarantee the borders, at a time when all other East 
Bloc countries are asking for the swift removal of Soviet forces. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's failure to speak clearly on the issue has put him at odds with his own 
foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher. At a political rally in the East 
German city of Erfurt on Wednesday, Genscher repeated what Kohl seems to find 
so difficult to say: "The people of Europe need to know that we raise no 
territorial demand against anyone, either now or in the future." 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which backs unification without the misgivings apparent in 
many European capitals, is also less than satisfied with the chancellor's 
recent statements on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's stance appears linked more to the intricacies of domestic German 
politics than any covert desire to recover land lost by Germany to Poland as a 
result of World War II, political observers say. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the degree of upset caused by his elusive stance reflects how deeply 
sensitivities about a powerful, united German state still run in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in the chancellery indicated Wednesday that Kohl might be prepared to 
shift still further to counter these concerns. An aide said the chancellor is 
actively considering a proposal made last week by Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki calling on both German states to enter immediate negotiations with 
Poland on a treaty that would effectively put the controversial border issue to 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Mazowiecki plan, the representatives of East and West Germany 
would initial the treaty, which would then be signed and ratified by a unified 
German government. 
</P>
<P>
A quirk of history that still leaves Europe without a formal peace treaty 
ending World War II also gives only a unified Germany the right under 
international law to negotiate a treaty fixing the Polish border along the 
present line of the Oder and Neisse Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're examining this idea very carefully," a Kohl aide said. "There is no 
fixed position on this yet." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl has consistently parried requests for reassurances on the border issue by 
noting that only a reunified Germany can deal with it. Few dispute that he is 
legally correct but many, including Genscher, believe that a strong political 
statement renouncing any territorial claims, such as the joint parliamentary 
declaration, is vital if reunification is to carry broad-based support. 
</P>
<P>
"For him (Genscher), it's not a question of political style, it's an absolute 
prerequisite for unity," explained a Foreign Ministry official. "The Dutch, the 
French, the Belgians, you name them, they feel they need these assurances." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's reluctance to participate in such a move appears to stem from his fear 
of alienating an important domestic constituency, the estimated 2 million 
Germans who still nurture strong cultural links with the regions of Silesia, 
Pomerania and East Prussia, all lost as a result of the war. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly 44,000 square miles of land, including such cities as Breslau and 
Oppeln, in what was eastern Germany when the war began, became western Poland 
after the war. Nearly 11 million people, roughly one-fifth of West Germany's 
population, were expelled from these regions in the early postwar years and 
resettled in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Those who actively maintain their heritage through cultural organizations 
belong almost exclusively to the moderate German right from which Kohl draws 
the bulk of his political base. While organizations of these expelled people 
reject the idea of trying to retake former German areas by force, they do 
demand compensation for lost property.

31 NAMED IN PHONY ACCIDENT SCHEME; 
</P>
<P>
FRAUD: THEY ARE ACCUSED OF COLLECTING $1 MILLION IN CLAIMS. OFFICIALS SAY IT IS 
ORANGE COUNTY'S LARGEST INSURANCE SCAM. 
</P>

<P>
Thirty-one people have been indicted on charges of staging scores of auto 
accidents and collecting $1 million in phony claims in Orange County's largest 
insurance scam ever, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The case, though massive, involves just one of dozens of fraud rings that 
generate an estimated $500 million to $1 billion in phony or inflated claims 
each year in California, insurance company executives and fraud investigators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials estimate that one out of every five dollars that consumers pay 
for auto insurance goes for fraudulent claims. Insurance companies cite fraud 
as a major cause of skyrocketing premium rates. 
</P>
<P>
The fraud scams are myriad and ingenious, investigators say. According to the 
indictments unsealed Wednesday, the Orange County ring, allegedly masterminded 
by a Fullerton body shop owner, used the same cars to submit scores of phony 
damage claims. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they'd take out five policies in a two-day period on the same car," 
said Officer Theresa Clark, who investigated the case for the California 
Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The car owners would then allegedly damage the autos -- including a Porsche and 
a Mercedes-Benz -- tell the insurance companies that one car had run into up to 
four others in a parking lot and then collect up to $10,000 in property damages 
on each car, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said the defendants knew that police would not investigate a parking lot 
crash in which no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"One of them said (the crash) happened in the Santa Ana Courthouse parking 
lot," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants allegedly filed similar claims on the same accident with 
multiple insurance companies, varying the details of the parking lot accident 
only slightly. The insurance companies, which included Farmers, State Farm, 
Mercury Casualty, Allstate, Travelers and Auto Club of Southern California, 
sometimes cross-check bodily injury reports but not property damage claims, 
Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan McNerney said he was not surprised by the 
alleged scam. "It's an easy thing to do, especially when the claims don't 
involve personal injury. They tried to get $3,000 to $5,000 per vehicle -- 
amounts that investigators usually aren't suspicious about." 
</P>
<P>
But the overall impact of hundreds of phony claims has prompted the insurance 
industry to push for legislation to make many types of insurance fraud felonies 
instead of misdemeanors, in hopes that prosecutors will take more interest in 
such cases. 
</P>
<P>
The State Bar of California also has identified at least 47 attorneys suspected 
of handling false insurance claims, and at least nine of them are under 
investigation, said deputy chief trial counsel Frank Bassios. 
</P>
<P>
Specialized units to prosecute auto insurance fraud are now being formed by 
district attorney's offices across the state, including Orange County's. 
Further mandates to curtail auto insurance fraud were included in Proposition 
103, the controversial insurance reform initiative passed in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
As an indication of the size of the overall problem, State Farm Insurance Co. 
statistics show that the bodily injury rate in California is 22.5 injuries per 
1,000 accidents. That is almost double the figure for similar accidents in the 
rest of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"The cars come together only 10% more in California, but you get hurt twice as 
often, and I just don't believe you people out there are more fragile than the 
rest of us," said G. Robert Mecherle, a claims vice president for State Farm 
Insurance in Bloomington, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, since 1986, reports of false automobile claims to the state 
Department of Insurance have increased by almost 300% statewide, from 1,355 to 
almost 4,000 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County case began to unfold in March, 1987, when a sheriff's deputy 
arrested one person named in the scheme and discovered that the suspect had 
fake identification and several insurance policies showing different names. The 
Sheriff's Department handed the case over to the California Highway Patrol, 
which submitted the case to the Orange County Grand Jury after 2 1/2 years of 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the grand jury issued a 28-page sealed indictment charging the 
31 suspects with nine counts of conspiracy to commit grand theft. The alleged 
ringleader, Norman Sidney Gerstein, 38, of Colton, was charged with nine 
conspiracy counts as well as one count of possession of cocaine for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say 60 people took out fake insurance policies, but the indictment 
names only 31. The defendants allegedly submitted 57 false claims to nine 
insurance companies from April, 1986, to March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP asked that the indictments be sealed to prevent the targets from 
fleeing before they could be arrested. Early Tuesday, CHP officers arrested 18 
of the 31 suspects, including Gerstein and his wife, in Orange, Riverside and 
Los Angeles counties, as well as in Sacramento. Three more of the accused 
turned themselves in to the court Wednesday morning, while one was already in 
state prison, serving time for an unrelated crime. 
</P>
<P>
Gerstein is being held in Orange County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail, and is 
expected to be arraigned Friday with some of the other defendants, McNerney 
said. The others are to be arraigned in two weeks, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the accused are still at large and investigators believe that at least 
four have left the state. They are now being sought in Florida, Oregon and 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the defendants could face a maximum penalty of three years in 
prison on each count of conspiracy to commit grand theft. On the cocaine 
charge, Gerstein also faces another four years. 
</P>
<P>
Gerstein is also suspected in a second fraud ring that involved employees of 
two more insurance companies, said Chief Clarence C. Tuck of the CHP's border 
division based in San Diego. Tuck declined to comment further because that case 
is still under investigation.

BUILDERS AND UNIONS REACH ACCORD ON DRUG TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES LABOR WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four Southern California construction associations and four building trades 
unions representing more than 100,000 workers said Wednesday they have reached 
agreement on drug testing of workers who are observed to be acting suspiciously 
on the job. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, spearheaded by the Associated General Contractors of California 
and covering union construction jobs in 11 counties, is among an increasing 
number of multi-employer pacts in the United States that are gradually breaking 
down union resistance to drug testing by assuring safeguards against arbitrary 
use. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Rothner, a labor law attorney who represented the Southern California 
District Council of Laborers in negotiations leading to the agreement, said it 
offers more protection of worker rights than numerous drug-testing programs 
that have been instituted by individual contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement allows contractors to require drug tests for "reasonable cause," 
based on observation of on-the-job behavior. It requires a second, confirming 
test of all samples and allows employees discharged for positive tests to 
appeal through the union grievance process. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's a major step," said Ken Perry, the Associated General 
Contractors' industrial relations director for Southern California, who 
negotiated the agreement. "There is recognition among unions that what we're 
talking about is job-site safety." 
</P>
<P>
Private employers are free to require any drug testing they want. More than 20% 
of all companies now test for drugs, according to a 1988 Labor Department 
study. 
</P>
<P>
But in unionized companies, the National Labor Relations Board has ruled that 
employers cannot begin drug-testing programs without first negotiating the 
subject with their unions. (Drug testing of job applicants does not require 
such negotiation.) 
</P>
<P>
Unions have complained that many drug-testing programs demanded by employers 
lack protection of employee privacy, do not require adequate confirmation of 
the tests or permit testing in too many circumstances, including periodic 
random testing without cause. In some cases unions have alleged that employers 
began programs without consultation. 
</P>
<P>
These objections are increasing because more private employers are introducing 
drug testing as government agencies begin to require it. "Private employers are 
getting into the act, saying they're doing it defensively, because all of the 
druggies -- applicants who can't get past the government tests -- are now 
coming to them for jobs," said an official of the United Brotherhood of 
Carpenters' national office. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California agreement, which Rothner said is the first agreement on 
drug-testing standards reached between coalitions of management and labor in 
the region, takes effect today. 
</P>
<P>
It will be used by members of the Associated General Contractors, the Building 
Industry Assn. of Southern California, the Engineering Contractors Assn. and 
the Southern California Contractors Assn. The four participating unions include 
the council of laborers, the Southern California Conference of Carpenters, the 
Eleven Southern California Counties Cement Masons and Teamsters Joint Council 
42. Unions representing ironworkers and equipment-operating engineers also were 
solicited but chose not to sign the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
A key compromise in the agreement was the willingness of the contractors groups 
to not require the right to test workers randomly. Testing will be restricted 
to workers whose behavior gives a supervisor and a second observing individual 
reasonable cause to suspect the worker is "impaired from performing" his or her 
job. This standard also will be applied to decisions on whether to test for 
drugs in the wake of accidents. Some employers have preferred to test all 
employees involved in accidents, regardless of circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Workers taken off the job after testing positive will be rehired if they go 
through a rehabilitation program and if work is available in their specialty. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you'll find anybody in our unions opposed to drug testing," said 
Jerry Cremins, president of the California Building and Construction Trades 
Council. "What they're afraid of is abuses in the system."

67% FAVOR LIFE TERM OVER GAS CHAMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN RODERICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Death penalty foes contended Wednesday that support for California's gas 
chamber executions is far softer than many believe, citing a poll showing 67% 
of state residents prefer that murderers receive a guaranteed life sentence and 
make cash restitution to the victim's family. 
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International and the ACLU released the poll results to kick off their 
final protests of the scheduled April 3 execution of convicted murderer Robert 
Alton Harris. He would be the first to die in the San Quentin gas chamber in 
two decades. 
</P>
<P>
"We see this as a long-term struggle," said Ramona Ripston, executive director 
of the ACLU of Southern California. "Even Robert Harris, whose crime was 
heinous, should not be executed." 
</P>
<P>
The groups contend that the poll, which found Californians hold a complexity of 
views about capital punishment, demonstrates that there could be new political 
resistance to the death penalty, though probably not before Harris is put to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Like most polls, the survey conducted in December found resounding backing for 
the idea of capital punishment. Nearly 80% said they favor the death penalty -- 
and 50% said they favor it strongly. 
</P>
<P>
But when the option was offered of life in prison without parole, coupled with 
the requirement that convicts work in prison and pay the victims' survivors, 
67% said they would prefer that to state-sanctioned death. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't like to have murder committed in their name," Ripston said. 
</P>
<P>
However, she conceded that the option offered by the poll does not now exist, 
and that the ACLU may not condone it anyway because the organization has doubts 
about requiring prisoners to work. 
</P>
<P>
Juries may now impose a sentence of life in prison without possibility of 
parole. The "life-without" sentence was created by the same state law that 
reauthorized capital punishment after California's old death penalty law was 
found unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. A number of murderers are 
serving such sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Ripston said the poll found that most people do not believe that the law means 
what it says. They hear about other prisoners being paroled and assume -- 
erroneously, she says -- that murderers given the "life-without" term have also 
been released on parole. 
</P>
<P>
"If people were absolutely convinced that a murderer would not be released from 
prison, they would not be for the death penalty," Ripston said. 
</P>
<P>
The poll, which was overseen by UC Santa Cruz professors Craig Haney and Aida 
Hurtado, found almost 65% opposed to executing the mentally retarded. But half 
said it was all right to put juveniles to death. 
</P>
<P>
John G. Healey, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said that if 
California resumes executions, the state will buck the trend of most Western 
nations disavowing the death penalty. Capital punishment, he said, is used 
where established authorities want to subjugate less-powerful minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"The death penalty is a human rights violation," Healey said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles press conference included Pastor Ignacio Castuera of Hollywood 
United Methodist Church, who said the major religions in the world have spoken 
against capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"The death penalty is the most premeditated crime that you could possibly 
have," Castuera said. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone poll was conducted by the San Francisco-based Field Institute in 
December -- before the Harris execution date was set. The poll has an error 
margin of plus or minus 4.5%.

DROUGHT LAW BANS WATERING GRASS; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATION: SANTA BARBARA IS THE FIRST CITY IN THE STATE TO ENACT SUCH A 
MEASURE IN THIS DRY SPELL, AND THE FIRST EVER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE 
COUNCIL ALSO BOOSTS WATER RATES SHARPLY.

SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Barbara is a city known for its Spanish architecture, its variety of 
flora, lush gardens and expansive lawns. But soon, tens of thousands of homes 
apparently will be framed not by manicured lawns but by straw-colored patches 
of desiccated grass. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a water shortage of almost 50% this year, the Santa Barbara City 
Council voted Tuesday night to make watering lawns illegal. In so doing, the 
city became the first in the state to ban lawn watering in response to the 
current dry spell, and the first ever in Southern California to enact such a 
measure to cope with drought, water experts said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the new ordinance, which took effect immediately, Santa Barbara 
residents also are prohibited from using hoses to water trees and shrubs, but 
are permitted to keep them alive with hand-held buckets or drip irrigation 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
Other conservation measures adopted by the council include a sharp increase in 
water rates. 
</P>
<P>
The ban on lawn watering will have a devastating impact on the city's landscape 
industry, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"Nurseries won't be selling lawn supplies, landscapers won't be putting in 
lawns and gardeners won't be mowing them," said Martin Senn, president of the 
California Assn. of Nurserymen's local chapter. "We're all going to have to lay 
low and try to survive this until the drought is over." 
</P>
<P>
Among the hardest hit will be the more than 1,500 gardeners in the city. Up to 
20% could lose their jobs, said Henry Camacho, president of the Santa Barbara 
Gardeners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The morning after the City Council's decision, Santa Barbara residents began 
searching for ways to keep their gardens alive. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had a sprinkler system man over to tell us about installing a drip 
system," said Vasanti Fithian, who has a large garden with 50 trees, as well as 
a variety of rose bushes and 75-year-old shrubs. "Some plants we'll keep alive 
through the drip system and through saving shower water. Others we'll just have 
to let die, along with the lawn. There's only so much water." 
</P>
<P>
To ensure that people don't violate the watering ban, three "drought officers" 
from the city's Public Works Department will be responding to violations. A 
warning citation will be issued for the first offense; a fine of up to $250 for 
the second; another $250 fine for the third, along with the possibility of 
water use restrictions, and a possible total shut-off for the fourth violation. 
</P>
<P>
The last time lawn watering was banned in the state was in 1977 in Northern 
California's Marin County during another serious drought, said Dean Thompson, a 
spokesman for the California Department of Water Resources. Thompson and 
spokesmen for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California say that 
to their knowledge, Santa Barbara is the first Southern California city to 
enact such a ban. 
</P>
<P>
The state's current drought has hit the area from Monterey to Santa Barbara 
particularly hard. Unlike Los Angeles and other areas in California that have 
access to water from the Sierra, the central coast relies solely on reservoirs 
and ground water pumping. 
</P>
<P>
And among the cities of the central coast, Santa Barbara has the greatest water 
shortage. Lake Cachuma provides Santa Barbara with the majority of its water, 
but it is at its lowest point ever -- 30% of capacity. And Gibraltar Reservoir 
near Montecito, which in the past had provided the city with about 30% of its 
water, ran dry in November. 
</P>
<P>
Lake Cachuma was designed to tolerate a seven-year drought, the longest known 
when the reservoir was created in the 1950s. The city is entering its seventh 
year without adequate rainfall -- the worst drought in more than 40 years, said 
Bill Ferguson, water development planner for Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal now is to keep the big things alive -- like trees and shrubs," 
Ferguson said. "Because the water shortage is so critical, we have to view turf 
and lawns as expendable." 
</P>
<P>
Also under the city's new Stage III drought plan, families will be paying much 
higher water rates. The average single-family home in Santa Barbara used to pay 
about $18 a month for water, Ferguson said. The same amount of water will now 
cost $76, he said. And those who use excessive amounts of water will be charged 
rates that increase dramatically as water use rises. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council had considered banning the watering of even trees and shrubs, 
and landscape professionals, worried that their industry would be wiped out, 
lobbied city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all aware of the seriousness of the drought, so we haven't fought the 
issue of letting turf and lawns go," said Autumn Brook of the Santa Barbara 
Green Industry Council, an association of landscape professionals. "We're all 
relieved that trees and shrubs were spared. So now we just have to approach 
horticulture in a different way. We'll be planting a lot of drought-resistant 
plants and installing low-volume irrigation systems." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council agreed to allow carwashes to keep operating and to let the 
city's Botanic Gardens use sprinklers. The council also will allow golf courses 
to keep greens and tees alive for four months, until a system using reclaimed 
water from the city sewage treatment plant can be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Cities throughout the state have instituted less severe measures to cope with 
the persistent drought, said Thompson of the state Water Resources Department. 
Monterey and San Luis Obispo counties have enacted laws to institute mandatory 
cuts of 20% in water use. Those who exceed their water allotment can be fined 
up to three times the amount of their water bill. The city of San Jose 
instituted mandatory water rationing last summer. And El Dorado County enacted 
a building moratorium until March, when officials can better estimate their 
water resources for the year.

Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens called for the temporary relocation of 
Roman Catholic nuns whose convent at Auschwitz sparked a Polish-Jewish dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Poland's Roman Catholic Church has begun construction of an interfaith prayer 
and dialogue center at the former Nazi death camp that will also contain a 
cloister for 16 Carmelite nuns. But Jewish leaders are unhappy with delays in 
moving the nuns. The construction is expected to take about 18 months. Arens 
ended an official visit to Poland after signing an agreement restoring full

Firefighters have doused flames at a dump in Hagersville, Canada, where 14 
million tires have been burning for more than two weeks, forcing hundreds of 
residents to evacuate the smoky fumes. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire isn't officially out yet, but there's no longer any flames or 
billowing smoke," Ontario Environment Ministry spokesman Gerry Merchant said. 
Workers have started going over the dump, which covers about 11 acres, looking 
for hot spots hidden in the remains of the burned tires at the Tyre King 
Recycling dump, about 150 miles east of Detroit. The tire dump, Ontario's 
largest, was declared an illegal waste site in 1985. The fire is believed to 
have been set by an arsonist.

SEISMIC: EPICENTER NEAR UPLAND. SOME DAMAGE BUT ONLY MINOR INJURIES REPORTED. 
ESTIMATED STRENGTH OF TEMBLOR VARIES FROM 5.5 TO 6.1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A strong earthquake struck near Upland on Wednesday afternoon, and while it 
shattered windows and set off at least two fires, the temblor appeared to cause 
only minor damage throughout much of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of serious injuries, but a number of people were being 
treated for cuts and bruises and other minor injuries, including two men hurt 
in a landslide. Most of the injuries came when groceries, crockery and books 
tumbled from shelves throughout the east San Gabriel Valley and western San 
Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
The temblor struck at 3:45 p.m. and lasted about 30 seconds. It was centered 
where two major geologic faults meet in the San Gabriel Mountains about three 
miles northwest of Upland -- roughly 40 miles east of downtown Los Angeles -- 
according to Lucille Jones, a seismologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's 
Pasadena office. 
</P>
<P>
Initial estimates of the earthquake's strength varied between 5.5 and 6.1 on 
the seismic intensity scale. By contrast, last October's earthquake in the Bay 
Area was estimated at 7.1 -- at least 10 times as strong. 
</P>
<P>
The Upland quake was preceded by a 3.6 foreshock that took place at 12:39 p.m. 
at the same location. Buildings swayed along a 250-mile front from Santa 
Barbara to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Seismologists described the quake as a "slip-strike earthquake," a reference to 
its horizontal movement. The strongest of at least 16 aftershocks recorded as 
of 5 p.m. measured 4, seismologists said. 
</P>
<P>
At least two fires broke out near the epicenter. One involved a house, the 
other a convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
Roberta Marley, an official at the Creative Extended Daycare Center in Upland, 
said she could see smoke billowing from a blaze near the school, which is 
attended by 48 children. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt the building swaying and we watched nearby homes sway," Marley said. 
"The kids were really good. They knew to get under tables if they were inside 
and on the ground if they were outside." 
</P>
<P>
Marley's husband, who runs a nearby ice cream shop, said a 900-pound ice cream 
machine crawled across the floor about five inches during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
"It was awesome," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the 400-bed Pomona Valley Community Hospital, an apparently quake-related 
water leak flooded a number of rooms, forcing the relocation of 40 to 60 
patients to other areas of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Claremont and La Verne declared local states of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
"We have minor damage throughout the city," said Claremont Cmdr. Gary 
Armstrong. "Anywhere from windows out to structural damage." 
</P>
<P>
Among the structures reporting some damage were the Claremont Library, the 
Sycamore School, Our Lady of Assumption Church and Pitzer College, which is 
part of the Claremont Colleges cluster. 
</P>
<P>
A security officer at the Claremont Colleges said there were two minor injuries 
reported on campus. One student was cut by a falling stereo speaker, and a 
woman was cut on the ankle by a toppling file cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
"We've evacuated everyone from the buildings. We're checking the buildings 
before we let anyone back in," said Mel Bourke, a campus security officer. At 
least two 18-by-12-foot glass plate windows at Pomona City Hall broke and fell 
inside the building and out onto the street, according to Mayor Donna Smith. 
Several other windows were cracked, and the ceiling of the finance department 
offices collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Water pipes broke at several apartments in Pomona, and half a dozen traffic 
lights blinked out. Officers were deployed to direct traffic and set up 
portable stop signs. 
</P>
<P>
A plate glass window shattered in a unused control tower at Ontario 
International Airport and ceiling tiles broke loose in the main terminal, 
according to Don Miller, deputy executive director of the Los Angeles 
Department of Airports. 
</P>
<P>
GTE California officials said three telephone switching centers in Covina, 
Upland and Mar Vista were knocked out of service for 15 minutes, affecting 
thousands of customers in the 818 and 714 area code zones, which stretch across 
the northern side of the Los Angeles metropolitan area and through San 
Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
The quake set off rockslides and cracked pavement across the Southland, 
crippling a number of roadways just as the evening rush hour began. 
</P>
<P>
A two-inch crack opened up on an off-ramp between Interstate 5 and California 
14 in the Newhall area -- the same spot where much of the freeway collapsed 
during the 1971 Sylmar quake. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a rock slide in the Newhall area so they have shut down Soledad Canyon 
Road, in both directions, east of Shadow Pines," said Sgt. Mike Brey of the 
California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said there were additional slides in the San Gabriel mountains on Mt. 
Baldy Road, north of Upland, on the Glendora Mountain Road north of Glendora 
and on California 39, north of Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
Two men were evacuated by helicopter from Angeles National Forest. One suffered 
a broken arm in the landslide. The condition of the second evacuee was not 
known, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Cars, buses and trucks jiggled and bounced as the quake rippled roadways across 
Southern California. One man reported that a 20,000-pound fire truck driving 
next to him on a Los Angeles street was bouncing "at least 12 inches off the 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
At a Los Angeles County Transportation Commission meeting in the downtown Hall 
of Administration, Supervisor Ed Edelman shouted for everyone to "get down" 
before taking refuge under his desk. A number of occupants fled the meeting 
room, but returned moments later, grinning sheepishly, when they realized the 
threat of damage had passed, 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council was finishing a debate on an ethics reform and 
public campaign financing measure as the quake rumbled through. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's any doubt about how God feels about public financing, this should 
answer it," Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky quipped after the shaking stopped. 
Yaroslavsky is a staunch foe of public campaign financing. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen Kay was launching into his testimony in the American 
Civil Liberties Union's case against the Hawthorne Police Department when the 
ceiling tiles began to squeak in the courtroom in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Stunned, the jurors and the defendant stared in fascination at the ceiling, and 
a few jurors yelled to Superior Court Judge Maurice Hogan, "Where shall we go, 
where shall we go?" 
</P>
<P>
Before anyone could move, the quake was over. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. William R. Winter and his wife, Phyllis, who live in Juniper Hills, a small 
community on the north slope of the San Gabriel Mountains, said coyotes in the 
hills around their house began howling at about 2 p.m, roughly an hour and 45 
minutes before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
"They kept it up for "a good hour or so," Phyllis Winter said. "I just wondered 
why." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW TO REACT IN A QUAKE 
</P>
<P>
If an earthquake strikes and you are . . . 
</P>
<P>
In your home: Do not run outside (most earthquake-related injuries happen 
outdoors). Get away from windows, mirrors and light fixtures. Watch out for 
tall bookcases or china cases that might topple. Climb under a table or desk or 
stand in a doorway if possible. If this isn't possible, crouch against a solid 
wall. Get into a duck-and-cover position, using sofa cushions or pillows to 
protect your head. 
</P>
<P>
In a car: Pull to the side of the road, if possible, and stop the car. Do not 
attempt to continue driving. Do not park under trees, light posts or signs. Do 
not park on or under a bridge. Stay inside your car and get down on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
In an office: Get under your desk or in a doorway, if possible. If not, crouch 
against a solid wall and protect your head with what is available, such as a 
book, notebook, large handbag, coat or briefcase. Many offices have fake 
drop-ceiling tiles that are easily shaken loose by quakes, so protecting your 
head is a must. 
</P>
<P>
In a mall or store: Get away from glass store fronts. Do not head for the 
exits, most of which are glass. Crouch against a solid wall. If you have 
children, put them against the wall and drape yourself over them in a crouching 
position. Make as small a target as possible. Do not attempt to use escalators 
or elevators. 
</P>
<P>
In an elevator: Most elevators will automatically stop moving when the shaking 
starts. When the quake stops, stomp on the floor in an attempt to get someone 
to hear you. If possible, escape through the trapdoor at the top of the 
elevator, because there is a danger of fire. 
</P>
<P>
In a restaurant: The safest place is under the table, since table-tops are made 
of sturdy material. Do not attempt to run across the restaurant if you are at a 
table or booth near the windows -- get under the table and protect your head. 
Many restaurants have objects on the walls that could fly across the room, so 
getting under your own table is the best bet. 
</P>
<P>
In a high-rise building: Get under a desk or stand in a doorway. Stay clear of 
windows, shelves, cabinets and glass partitions. Most high-rises are built so 
they will sway with a quake more than you would think, but it is actually a 
protection to keep them from toppling. Do not run for the exit because the 
stairways may be broken and/or jammed with people. Do not attempt to use the 
elevator since the power may have failed. 
</P>
<P>
In a parking garage: Do not run. Crouch against a pillar or solid wall, 
covering your head with your purse, jacket or shopping bags. If in your car, do 
not attempt to drive. Stay in the car and get down on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
In schools: Each school is required by the state to have an 
earthquake-preparedness plan and to have practiced earthquake drills. Children 
should get under their desks and cover their heads, and move away from windows 
if at all possible. The school can provide a copy of its earthquake plans to 
any parent wishing to see them. 
</P>
<P>
In a hospital: Every hospital accredited by the Joint Commission of Hospital 
Accreditation is required to have an earthquake response plan and practice 
periodic drills. If you are a patient, you should ask what to do in the event 
of an earthquake, especially if you are hooked up to an intravenous bottle or 
other medical equipment. Also ask the hospital personnel what their evacuation 
plan is. 
</P>
<P>
Outdoors or in a rural area: Get to where there are fewest possible hazards 
from above -- away from trees, power poles, light posts, etc. Flying debris is 
what usually hurts people, so the fewer objects that are around you the better. 
</P>
<P>
In the mountains: If possible, get away from trees and rocks and into the 
brush, which will catch some of the flying debris. Crouch and cover your head 
with your pack or whatever else is handy. Steer clear of boulders, which can be 
jarred loose by the quake. Be aware that trails may be wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
On the beach: Stay put during the quake -- there are very few dangers on the 
beach. When the shaking stops, get off the beach because a tsunami (a wall of 
water that can measure up to 40 feet high) may have been triggered. Grab 
essentials and go to the parking lot. Remember to put on shoes, because there 
may be broken glass.

Rival Christian militias exchanged tank and artillery fire Wednesday in East 
Beirut, violating a shaky 12-day-old truce and sending panicked civilians to 
underground shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that troops loyal to Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun and fighters 
of the Lebanese Forces militia fought at dawn around the hilltop neighborhood 
of Ashrafiyeh. 
</P>
<P>
The thud of explosions shook the capital and sent panicked civilians rushing to 
bunkers for cover as artillery and mortar shells slammed into residential 
areas. The fighting died down after about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
More than 700 people have been killed since the battle for control of the 
Christian enclave erupted Jan. 31, when Aoun ordered Samir Geagea's Lebanese 
Forces to disarm. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior Muslim militia official told Reuters news agency that the 
United States and Iran have held secret talks on releasing eight American 
hostages held by pro-Iranian extremist groups in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be identified, said senior Iranian Foreign 
Ministry officials and an American negotiator met in New York in December. A 
second round of talks took place in Geneva in January. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials on Tuesday denied reports of such direct talks. 
</P>
<P>
In London, Peggy Say, the sister of journalist Terry A. Anderson, the 
longest-held Western hostage, said she is hopeful that the United States, Syria 
and Iran are cooperating toward the release of the 16 foreign hostages.

GREENHOUSE EFFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have read many articles about the Greenhouse effect. It frightens me that 
despite constant warning by scientists, no concerted effort is being made by 
the nations of the world to prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
When we gamble on the validity of the Greenhouse effect, it's like playing 
Russian roulette. The Greenhouse gun is aimed at our world. Is the barrel 
loaded or empty? If nothing is done, we'll soon find out.

DOMESTIC ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today I was watching Congress on TV. (When) Robert Dornan spoke . . . he said 
he was disappointed in the previous speakers because they addressed only 
domestic issues. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan proceeded to say that this was one of the greatest days in U.S. history 
because a democratic government was elected in Nicaragua. He then told Congress 
that since the age of 16 he has been a fighter against communism. 
</P>
<P>
I am fortunate to have Ron Packard as my representative. He is also against 
communism, but spends most of his time in Congress on domestic issues that he 
feels will help this country be better.

<P>
UCI LIBRARY: A NEED FOR REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Serious problems, including charges of racism and low employee morale, have 
plagued UC Irvine's library for more than a year. A recent faculty report 
focused blame on the library's chief administrator, Calvin Boyer. 
</P>
<P>
It asked the university administration to evaluate him immediately and to 
review UCI's policy for the head librarian, a post that is not subject to the 
same review as department heads. UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason should follow 
through on these recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
The faculty committee conducted its study after receiving complaints that some 
employees had mocked Asian and Middle Eastern library patrons. There were also 
concerns expressed by library staffers that minority and women workers were 
denied promotions unfairly and charges that the library had dragged its feet in 
minority recruitment on a campus where half the student body consists of 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The committee found the problems were more the result of poor management and "a 
highly politicized work environment" than of any intent by library officials to 
mistreat minorities or women. It described the library as in a crisis stemming 
from a "very serious morale problem." 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the report, Boyer said press attention and the faculty study had 
exacerbated the library's problems. He said that mistreatment incidents were 
isolated and that the record on hiring was good. That's not an adequate 
response. The administration should review Boyer's tenure and take appropriate 
action to ensure that the library's leadership is in step with the changes 
taking place as UCI heads into the 21st Century.

HENEFELD A REAL STEAL FOR HUSKIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE BERKOWITZ, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it was over, they chanted: "Nadav! Nadav! Nadav!" 
</P>
<P>
But the scene was not Hartford Civic Center or Gampel Pavilion or Connecticut 
Field House or any other place the Connecticut Huskies have played this season. 
</P>
<P>
It was Woodbury, Conn., in the locker room of Nonnewaug High School's boys 
basketball team. And Nonnewaug had just defeated neighboring Gilbert School 
after making eight steals in the fourth quarter of a game in January. 
</P>
<P>
"They do that in practice too," said Nonnewaug Coach Darryl Morhardt. "Anytime 
somebody makes a steal, they all yell 'Nadav!' " 
</P>
<P>
On the nation's Hot Team of the 1989-90 season, Nadav Henefeld is searing. He 
is a 6-foot-7 1/2, 219-pound, nearly-22-year-old freshman forward from Israel. 
Second in the nation in steals, with a school-record 115 in 28 games. Among 
Connecticut's top three in scoring, rebounding, assists, field-goal shooting, 
three-point shooting, free-throw shooting and blocked shots. Smart. Handsome. 
In serious demand. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a legend here," said Steve Pikiell, a junior guard for the Huskies. "I'm 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to know where Nadav (pronounced nah-DUV) is. Everyone wants to 
know what he's doing. Everyone wants to know what he's doing after games. You 
go to parties, and everyone's like, 'Where's Nadav? Where's Nadav?' People have 
been waiting for a winner here, and he's stepped in and become everyone's 
hero." 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies never have finished higher than third in the Big East Conference. 
They have not finished higher than seventh since 1981-82. They were the only 
Big East team that did not participate in an NCAA tournament during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
With the Hartford Whalers as virtually the only other winter sports diversion 
in the state, the Huskies are subjected to almost microscopic scrutiny from 
about 30 Connecticut media outlets. 
</P>
<P>
"This place," said the Bristol-raised Pikiell, "it's kind of crazy." 
</P>
<P>
And right now it's crazy for Nadav, who has been named Big East rookie of the 
week three times and became the first freshman to win the conference's 
player-of-the-week award. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld grew up in Ramat-Hasharon, not far from Tel Aviv. He said he began 
dreaming about playing college basketball in the United States when he was 
about 16. But like all Israelis, he went from high school to the military for 
three years of active duty. Not that this interfered with his basketball, you 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't in the army like a regular soldier," he said. "I had the basic 
training and that was it. The rest of my service in the army, I played more 
basketball than army. My service was as a sportsman, not as a regular soldier." 
</P>
<P>
He played for the Israeli national team, and began to acquire a reputation as 
one of his nation's best players. At about this time last year, with the end of 
his military-service commitment in sight, he wrote to about 20 U.S. colleges -- 
and received practically no response. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he was challenging Israel's club-basketball system in court. Israeli 
players are assigned to clubs based on where they grew up. Henefeld didn't want 
to play for the club that owned his rights, but the courts ruled against him. 
</P>
<P>
That's where Marv Kessler and Schmuel Zisman stepped in. Zisman was the lawyer 
who represented Henefeld. He also happened to have played in Israel for 
Kessler, a former head coach at Adelphi who now is a scout for the Portland 
Trail Blazers. Kessler saw Henefeld play in Israel and was convinced he could 
be a Division I player. 
</P>
<P>
So when Zisman told Kessler that Henefeld wanted to come to the United States, 
Kessler told one of his friends -- St. John's Coach Lou Carnesecca. At 
Kessler's behest, Carnesecca invited Henefeld for a visit. At St. John's 
expense, Henefeld arrived in mid-April. He liked everything about the school 
except its lack of dormitories. 
</P>
<P>
He ended up visiting Connecticut on the day he was scheduled to go home. 
</P>
<P>
"He was leaving for Israel at 9 p.m.," Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun said. "We 
had (assistant) Dave Leitao drive down, pick him up at 5:30 in the morning, and 
he spent that day here at UConn." 
</P>
<P>
It was a fine spring day, and Connecticut's bucolic campus was more in line 
with Henefeld's idea of what an American college should look like. Rolling, 
wooded hills instead of a concrete jungle. Dormitories instead of apartments. 
Yes, Henefeld decided during his hours in Storrs, this was the place. 
</P>
<P>
Calhoun cemented the deal -- and satisfied his own questions about Henefeld -- 
by making a six-day trip to Israel in July for the Maccabiah Games. 
</P>
<P>
But there were complications. When Henefeld visited in April, he took the SAT 
but failed to attain the score required for eligibility as a freshman. 
Connecticut appealed to the NCAA to give him another chance in the fall because 
Henefeld didn't have a chance to prepare while in the army. The NCAA granted 
it, but in order the get the results back quickly enough to play this season, 
Henefeld had to fly to Raleigh, N.C. at his own expense in mid-October to take 
the test. He missed the first two weeks of practice while awaiting the score, 
which was a passing one. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NCAA received a mysterious letter, written in Hebrew, that 
claimed Henefeld had been paid to play in some games in Israel. Investigations 
by NCAA and Connecticut officials showed otherwise. His first formal workout 
with the Huskies came on Nov. 1 -- in an exhibition game against Marathon Oil. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld and the Huskies have been rolling since. They have set single-season 
school records for overall victories (24), Big East victories (11) and have 
attained their highest ranking. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Tate George, their only senior, has become a consistent all-around 
player. Sophomore off-guard Chris Smith has blossomed into one of the nation's 
best back-court prospects. Junior guard John Gwynn has found happiness as a 
reserve, averaging 10.5 points in 17.2 minutes per game. Rod Sellers, the 6-9 
starting center, has become a scoring threat inside. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman swingman-baseball pitcher Scott Burrell spurned a huge contract offer 
from the Seattle Mariners, who made him their No. 1 draft choice last year, to 
become the third consecutive Connecticut high-school basketball player of the 
year to stay at home. Junior forwards Lyman DePriest and Murray Williams, and 
7-1 sophomore center Dan Cyrulik have become fine role players. 
</P>
<P>
That's where Henefeld's special mix of basketball skills, on-and off-court 
experiences, and personability come in. Like a mason using mortar to construct 
a path, Calhoun has used Henefeld to magically bond the Huskies, creating a 
yellow brick road. 
</P>
<P>
"Nadav has been the stabilizer," said Calhoun, who came to Connecticut after 14 
years at Northeastern, where he took a Division II program and built it into a 
perennial NCAA tournament participant that produced players such as Boston 
Celtics guard Reggie Lewis. "I think his age makes a difference, but he's a 
mature guy and he probably was mature at 18. The fact that he took on the 
Israeli club system a little bit helped. So, some of the things we see are 
chronological, but others are personality traits that make him somewhat unique. 
</P>
<P>
"If he was a kid with any kind of a sense of arrogance, I think it would be 
entirely different. He guards (his teammates') notoriety and their successes 
like he would an egg. He makes sure that does not crack." 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld seems to be even more captivating than those Big East imports who were 
all the rage for excellent teams last season -- Georgetown's Dikembe Mutombo 
and Seton Hall's Andrew Gaze. 
</P>
<P>
Said George: "Everyone kind of calls me The Governor because after four years I 
know a lot of people. After one year he knows the whole state, so we're trying 
to figure out what to call him." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it's just the hurricane of attention that constantly swirls around the 
only show in a town smaller than Washington or New York, but perhaps it is the 
tremendous sense of pride Henefeld seems to inspire in his homeland and among 
Jews in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He did nothing to hurt this in November, when, with the NCAA's and 
Connecticut's permission, he went home to play an Israeli national-team game 
against France. He flew to Tel Aviv on Nov. 18, played on Nov. 22 (scoring 23 
points in an Israel victory), left two hours after the game and rejoined the 
Huskies 26 hours later -- in Anchorage for the Great Alaska Shootout, where in 
three games he totaled 29 points, 15 rebounds and 13 steals. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli flag has been waved in the crowd at many Connecticut home games, 
media outlets in Israel phone the school's sports-information office after 
every game and Jewish publications from all over the United States have written 
stories on Henefeld. Like everything else, he has taken it in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy that I can make people feel good about themselves or about me 
playing well here, and I really appreciate it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He would rather be just one of the guys. One of his early highlights was being 
chewed out for the first time by Calhoun, who can be wonderfully acerbic but 
was understandably gentle with Henefeld at first. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld also wants to be viewed as a student, not as a basketball mercenary -- 
what some accused Gaze of being last year when, after helping lead Seton Hall 
to the Final Four, he promptly bolted for home. 
</P>
<P>
"The reasons I'm here are many," Henefeld said. "To play basketball, of course, 
but also to get an education and see another place and experience another 
culture. I think that other than an education, you can get so many things from 
seeing another place and living in another culture and meeting some new people. 
I think it helps you as a person. So it's not just the sport." 
</P>
<P>
This was the approach preached to him by Moti Daniel, an Israeli who played for 
George Washington from 1985 to 1987 and with whom Henefeld is friendly.

FOREIGN SALES CITED AS GNP IS REVISED HIGHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The economy grew at a slightly more robust pace of 0.9% in the fourth quarter 
last year, rather than the 0.5% reported earlier, but 1989 still marked the 
weakest GNP expansion in three years, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The more robust pace was aided by higher-than-initially reported foreign sales, 
the department said in explaining its first revision of the quarterly figures, 
which face a final revision next month. 
</P>
<P>
For the full year, the gross national product, the measure of total goods and 
services produced, expanded at an inflation-adjusted rate of 3% from 4.4% in 
1988 and 3.7% in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Economists, who had expected a slight downward revision in the fourth-quarter 
GNP to a 0.4% annual rate of growth, called the upward revision a heartening 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless there is some real shock, we're not likely to see any really 
significant decline in the economy this year, certainly not a recession," said 
Sam Kahan, chief economist with Fuji Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected rise in the GNP figure pushed the dollar higher and Treasury 
bond prices lower. The dollar rose to 1.7050 West German marks in midday 
trading from 1.6885 marks at Tuesday's close in the belief that the GNP figure 
points to no drop in U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying before Congress Wednesday, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan 
Greenspan said he expected "slow but positive" first-quarter expansion in GNP. 
He compared weak orders for durable goods to a leak in a tire that has been 
fixed. 
</P>
<P>
"That leak has ended," Greenspan said. "The system is no longer eroding. It has 
stabilized and has not exhibited any weakening." 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Business Economists forecast this week that the economy 
would grow sluggishly in 1990, expanding at about a 1.7% real annual rate. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase in the quarterly growth estimate, the fourth-quarter rate 
of growth was the weakest GNP performance since the third quarter of 1986, when 
it grew by 0.8%. 
</P>
<P>
The 3% annual rate of increase in GNP during 1989 was the smallest rise since 
1986

COMING TO GRIPS WITH HISTORY OF 'MOTHERLAND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, TIMES BOOK CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Motherland by Timothy O'Grady (Henry Holt: $19.95; 230 pages). 
</P>
<P>
A story is a ride; a parable is a taxi ride with the meter issuing a steady 
reminder of what is being collected from us. The ride had better be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
There are some enthralling bits of landscape in Timothy O'Grady's ornately 
related Irish jaunt. But for a lot of the time, the main movement is the clock 
ticking away: Parable, parable. 
</P>
<P>
A fat, self-indulgent, oddly infantile narrator, who lives with his mother in 
Dublin, comes home after leaving in a drunken rage. The apartment is empty. 
Steam fills it from a hot water tap left running; there is a smell of mildew 
and rot. Only the mother's pet monkey, starving, filthy and furious, remains. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a book, a collection of documents starting in the 12th Century 
and extending into modern times. They are the records, century by century, of 
the Synnott family. The narrator reads the chronicle -- it is his family's. He 
also tracks down Decklin Synnott, a gnomic old man who, as we learn, is the 
narrator's grandfather and may know where his mother has gone. 
</P>
<P>
They start out on a quest, accompanied by the monkey and Decklin's poodle. They 
have made a compact. Decklin will help the narrator look for his mother. In 
turn, the narrator, born with webbed fingers and the gift of second sight, will 
help Decklin find 12 missing pages of the family book, hidden somewhere in 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
What is in the Synnott chronicle, what the narrator and Decklin recall of their 
lives, and what happens on their pilgrimage and afterward -- all these form the 
body of "Motherland." As for the meaning, it is in the title. 
</P>
<P>
Pulpy, self-pitying, overweight, alcoholic, mother-fixated, sexually prim, 
ignorant and sentimental, the narrator is the Irish people. His mother is 
Ireland herself, part farrow-gobbler, part Mother Machree, and above all, 
necessary and elusive. Old Decklin is the teacher; his book, Irish history. 
Through the ordeals and riddles of their quest, the narrator will grasp his 
history, come to terms with it, overcome it and, finally, after a millennium of 
pain and evasion, be joined in understanding with his own soil. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, the recurring symbol is doubleness. Webbed hands are the mark of 
the amphibian -- land and water -- Decklin tells his pupil; and they betoken 
his second sight. Eight hundred years earlier, Hugh, the second of the Synnott 
lineage, had the same stigma and the same gift. 
</P>
<P>
Decklin, the sage, finds his double in Bertrand de Paor, who accompanied Hervey 
and Milo Synnott across to Ireland in the 12th Century to back the Irish king 
of Leinster in reclaiming his throne. He helps them build their castle and, 
driven out by an Anglo-Norman baron, he becomes prophet and bard to their 
wandering tribe. The narrator's mother has her double in Emer, mother of Hugh. 
Found dying at the end of the book, mother turns out to have had a twin sister. 
</P>
<P>
Behind all the doubling, of course, lies the image of divided Ireland. Past and 
present feed into each other. Decklin knows every spot in Ireland where blood 
has been shed; the pilgrimage will go from bloodshed to bloodshed, from 
Norman's swords to the United Irishman swinging from ropes under a Liffey 
bridge, to the contemporary British Army. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you are a repository of unpleasant facts," the narrator protests to 
Decklin at the outset. He squalls like a baby for his mother. "It was all the 
little things -- the way she kept me tidy and peaceful, the way she sang to me 
when I had a bad night. She used to clean between my toes for me because I 
couldn't reach them." 
</P>
<P>
Decklin mothers him briefly, gives him a bath, washes his toes. The sage 
dresses him in a white robe and gives him the tonsure of the old Celtic 
scholars. But the pair will harden as they walk through the land; the narrator 
will grow lean and brown, his mystical images will recede and he will 
substitute knowledge, love and fellowship for them. 
</P>
<P>
When his teacher is killed by an Army patrol, he is able to go on alone. The 
killing takes place in the South, so it is not clear just what Army is 
involved. The time is the prophetic and therefore decidedly elastic and 
accommodating near-future. 
</P>
<P>
"Motherland" is told in a florid prose whose Irish lilt seems more contrived 
than spontaneous. The narrator is sprawling and formless. That is 
understandable, insofar as he has to represent the entire Irish people, but it 
makes him invisible and highly intrusive at the same time, like a ghost with 
bad breath. Every conceivable piece of Irish soul and color comes into his 
story except, perhaps, for wit and genuine lyricism. O'Grady's lyricism, most 
of the time, is mannered and self-conscious, although there are moments of real 
charm in the chronicle of the early Synnotts. 
</P>
<P>
Decklin, full of dry surprises, is more successful. The role of the guru can be 
a tedious one, but he possesses a welcome matter-of-factness and an occasional 
touch of fraudulence. It is a fraudulence that provides the book's most genuine 
notes.

When Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena closes the San Gabriel Valley's 
last trauma center in May, accident victims here may not get the care they need 
to save their lives, a county health official said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital announced Friday that, after a $3.7-million loss last year, it 
will pull out of Los Angeles County's trauma care system May 1. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a major setback for health care in the San Gabriel Valley," said Virginia 
Price-Hastings, chief of the county's troubled trauma center network. 
</P>
<P>
It will mean that many accident victims lose the chance for critical care 
during the "golden hour," the first hour after an injury when the chances of 
survival are greatest, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency rooms also treat life-threatening injuries, but unlike trauma 
centers, they do not have surgeons and anesthesiologists on duty at all times. 
"Trauma (care) saves 50% more lives than in a comparable emergency room," said 
David Langness, a spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
And emergency rooms also face increased demand. Space at emergency rooms 
frequently becomes so tight that many are forced to close temporarily when they 
are full, and patients and paramedics often end up "shopping" for an open one. 
</P>
<P>
The county's trauma network began in 1983 with 23 participating hospitals, but 
will have just 12 left when Huntington leaves. The network was designed to 
guarantee that patients with multiple life-threatening injuries to vital organs 
such as the heart, brain and lungs could be rushed to a trauma center and a 
waiting surgical staff within 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel Valley residents are well-covered by a medical response plan for 
major disasters such as earthquakes, Price-Hastings said, but are vulnerable 
when it comes to treatment for daily trauma injuries. The county plan is not 
activated and its network of emergency medical workers are not summoned for 
daily cases, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the public think trauma care is for gang members" Price-Hastings 
said. But she said most trauma cases result from car and motorcycle accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the hospital council show that although 17% of trauma victims 
are shooting or stabbing victims, 44% are injured in car accidents. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we get behind the wheel, we expose ourselves," Price-Hastings said. 
</P>
<P>
After Huntington's announcement, about 50 people telephoned the hospital, 
fearing that the emergency room would be closed, hospital spokeswoman Peg Kean 
said. She reassured them that, like the other trauma centers that have dropped 
out of the county network, Huntington will keep its emergency room open. 
</P>
<P>
Once a model trauma network, the county's system has rapidly deteriorated, 
mainly because hospitals say they are losing millions of dollars each year on 
trauma care. Health experts cited as major problems reduced Medi-Cal and 
Medicare reimbursements and uninsured patients who cannot pay. 
</P>
<P>
At Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital, which serves communities including 
Hacienda Heights and whose trauma center closed last summer, 18% to 20% of the 
trauma patients had no medical insurance, hospital President Lowell Smith said. 
Medi-Cal reimburses only 50% and Medicare 60%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The potential collapse of the county's trauma network shows that what is needed 
is "nothing less than a program of universal, comprehensive health care 
coverage," said Stan Dorn, staff attorney for the National Health Law Program 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County's soaring population of about 8.8 million exacerbates the 
problem, Langness said. During the first year the county operated its network, 
4,500 trauma patients were treated; by last year, the number had skyrocketed to 
14,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The first San Gabriel Valley trauma center to leave the network was Pomona 
Valley Community Hospital, which closed its center in 1986. Queen of the Valley 
in West Covina followed in 1987. Last year, Methodist Hospital of Southern 
California in Arcadia pulled out in January, and Presbyterian Intercommunity 
Hospital in Whittier followed suit in August. 
</P>
<P>
At Huntington and Methodist, officials emphasize that staff surgeons live in 
the community and are able to get to the hospital within 20 minutes of being 
called. But Price-Hastings said being on call is not as good as being in the 
hospital when the patient arrives. "They may or may not get there to save a 
life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for some current and former trauma centers, however, said requiring 
on-duty surgeons and anesthesiologists is simply too costly -- no less than 
$500,000 a year at Queen of the Valley Hospital, for example, said Jim Haden, 
chief executive officer of the hospital. He said that before the trauma center 
closed, the hospital asked the county to ease the requirements for the trauma 
center designation. The county turned down the request. 
</P>
<P>
Without a trauma center in the San Gabriel Valley after May 1, the closest 
trauma center will be Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center in Los Angeles. 
Located near the intersection of the San Bernardino and Golden State freeways, 
the 2,045-bed facility is just outside the valley's western end, more than 30 
miles from Pomona on the eastern edge. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on traffic and where the accident occurred, the ride to County-USC 
could take an hour or more. And even if paramedics can rush a trauma patient to 
County-USC within 20 minutes, there is a growing possibility that the patient 
could be turned away for lack of room. 
</P>
<P>
Long the hospitals of last resort when other facilities are full, county 
hospitals have also been forced to close trauma centers after reaching 
capacity. At County-USC, for example, the trauma center had to close down for 
more than 50 hours in December and more than 90 hours in January, 
Price-Hastings said. Those months are among the busiest in the year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Any patient who could not reach an open trauma center within 20 minutes would 
have to be transferred to a hospital emergency room, where a surgeon and 
anesthesiologist may not be immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the situation is the steady rise in the use of emergency rooms, a 
result of growing population, demise of trauma centers and the fact that 
emergency rooms are often the major access to health care for indigent 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
At Huntington last spring, for example, a woman who lived in a Pasadena motel 
called 911 and was rushed to the emergency room where, in what was her first 
contact with a doctor in eight months of pregnancy, she gave birth to a girl. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency room visits at Pomona Valley Hospital jumped from 4,200 in 1986 to 
5,500 in 1989, spokeswoman Laura Elek said. 
</P>
<P>
At Huntington, the largest hospital in the San Gabriel Valley, the emergency 
room reached capacity and had to close five times in January and three times in 
February, Kean said. The closures usually occurred at night and lasted one to 
four hours, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some hospitals have been known to close their emergency rooms even though there 
are vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, county health inspectors issued warnings to Greater El Monte 
Community Hospital and Inter-Community Medical Center in Covina for temporarily 
closing their emergency rooms to ambulance traffic in late January even though 
they still had empty beds. Greater El Monte said its two vacant beds weren't 
equipped with medical monitors, and Inter-Community said the county's warning 
resulted from a misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Price-Hastings said that hospitals have generally complied with closure rules 
but that the county will continue to monitor the closures and issue warnings if 
needed. Hospitals with vacancies that intentionally close emergency rooms will 
be reported to state licensing authorities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1983, 23 hospitals in Los Angeles County joined a new trauma 
center network designed to guarantee acute care to any accident victim within 
20 minutes. Trauma centers and emergency rooms treat life-threatening injuries, 
but only trauma centers are required to have surgeons and anesthesiologists on 
duty around the clock. Because of soaring costs and the inability of many 
trauma patients to pay, 10 hospitals have left the network. On May 1, 
Huntington Memorial Hospital will become the 11th to drop out, leaving San 
Gabriel Valley residents without any trauma center.

GANDHI'S PARTY LOSING IN STATE LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
INDIA: THE DEFEATS IN CONGRESS-I STRONGHOLDS MAY BE THE END OF THE POLITICAL 
TRAIL FOR THE EX-PRIME MINISTER.

<P>
Hundreds of millions of Indian voters dealt yet another defeat to former Prime 
Minister Rajiv Gandhi and his long-ruling Nehru family on Wednesday, as results 
from key state elections strengthened India's new ruling coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Projections based on partial returns and announced on state-run television 
showed Gandhi's Congress-I Party losing in virtually all eight Indian states 
electing new legislatures this week. All were traditional Congress-I 
strongholds that had all been controlled by the party for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat comes just three months after Gandhi and his party were driven from 
power in the national Parliament. Analysts predicted that the former prime 
minister is likely to be replaced soon as leader of his own party, which is now 
India's main opposition group. 
</P>
<P>
"It is now clear that Rajiv Gandhi has, indeed, presided over the death of a 
dynasty," one diplomat said of the 45-year-old former airline pilot who, as 
grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru and son of Indira Gandhi, was the third generation 
of the family's Indian prime ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Gandhi campaigned heavily in recent weeks for his party's candidates, often 
flying his own plane to remote regions of all eight states. But Gandhi's 
replacement, Indian Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh, whose Janata Dal 
(People's Party) was leading Wednesday in several of the state contests, also 
barnstormed the states in a populist campaign that strengthened his own 
national image as a reformer. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most striking results, though, showed India's newly emerged, 
right-wing Hindu party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (Indian People's Party), 
heading for its first state victories in the key central Indian states of 
Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. 
</P>
<P>
Singh, whose party won just 141 of the 525 parliamentary seats at stake in last 
year's national polls, has been ruling the nation in a shaky alliance with the 
Hindu-fundamentalist party, which won 88 national seats, and India's Communist 
parties, which won 44. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wednesday's results deepened the grass-roots base of Singh's national 
alliance with the Hindu fundamentalists, analysts said they also further 
documented the rise of Hindu chauvinism in modern India, which officially is a 
secular state despite its 80% Hindu majority. 
</P>
<P>
Singh's People's Party was expected to win by a large margin in the populous 
eastern state of Orissa, but it was virtually tied with the Hindu 
fundamentalists in the politically key western state of Gujarat, where a local 
coalition between the two groups is now likely. 
</P>
<P>
But the results of this week's polls also reinforced another alarming national 
trend in India -- a sharp increase in brutal election violence. 
</P>
<P>
More than 80 people were stabbed, beaten and shot to death during the voting 
Tuesday in one state alone, the impoverished and violent eastern state of 
Bihar. Armed gangs from virtually every political party in the state, where 
local Mafias wield more power than the politicians, commandeered scores of 
polling places, stuffed boxes with tens of thousands of fake ballots, shot and 
killed poll watchers, staged gun battles with police and kidnaped government 
election officials. 
</P>
<P>
A slow vote count was reported in Bihar and Arunachal Pradesh. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, analysts said that the only marginally strong showing by Gandhi's 
party was in the northern Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, where, at best, 
they said the Congress-I might serve in coalition with the Hindu fundamentalist 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Bombay's state of Maharashtra also voted for a new legislature this week, but 
officials will not start counting there until today.

KAIFU WILL TRY TO CONVINCE BUSH THAT TRADE PROGRESS IS BEING MADE; 
</P>
<P>
SUMMIT: JAPAN'S LEADER CITES GAINS ON CUTTING THE SURPLUS AND OPENING MARKETS. 
BUT HE OFFERS NO HINT OF CONCESSIONS.

<P>
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said Wednesday he will try to convince President 
Bush at their Palm Springs summit that Japan is making progress both in opening 
its markets and in cutting its trade surplus with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In a nationally televised news conference after naming a new Cabinet, Kaifu 
offered no hint of new concessions, despite warnings from Washington that a 
breakthrough in solving economic disputes is needed before relations "get out 
of hand." 
</P>
<P>
A senior Japanese diplomat, speaking not for attribution, said privately that 
what Kaifu wants and needs most in talks at Palm Springs on Friday and Saturday 
is reaffirmation from Bush that he considers Japan an important ally and a 
"global partner" of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Putting economic frictions into a framework of that larger -- and more 
important -- relationship will be Kaifu's main goal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu himself complained to reporters that "only negative, dark aspects of 
U.S.-Japan relations are being focused upon. But Japan and the United States 
have a partnership. We should emphasize our points of commonality and quietly 
solve our points of difference." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thinks relations are deteriorating, he replied: "I do not even 
think of a worsening of U.S.-Japan relations. We are trying to improve 
relations by carrying out talks on economic issues. . . . It is precisely 
because we consider U.S.-Japan relations important that we want to make efforts 
to prevent a worsening." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged, however, that solving frictions has become "urgent" and 
stressed that Japan regards its ties with Washington as the axis of its entire 
global diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese diplomat said Kaifu needs Bush's help to counteract hostility that 
is spreading against Japan in the United States. American criticism has spread 
from the longstanding bilateral trade imbalance to Japanese investment, to 
Japanese financial power, to Japanese culture and even to a questioning of 
whether Japan is a true democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Congress members advocating managed trade have latched on to so-called 
revisionist scholars' arguments that Japan, as a "unique" country, cannot be 
treated by standard rules, the diplomat complained. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu said he must discuss with Bush "what role Japan can play and how it can 
coordinate its policy with the United States" now that the world is moving away 
from an East-West confrontation based upon military power. During the campaign 
for the Feb. 18 election for the lower house of Parliament, the prime minister 
said that Japan wants to join the United States in establishing "a new world 
order." 
</P>
<P>
Another diplomat, briefing reporters who will accompany Kaifu, complained that 
when Americans think of Japan, "the thing that comes into their minds 
immediately is economic problems." 
</P>
<P>
"But we have entered a world in which there are problems that the United States 
can no longer solve by itself. Neither can Japan alone solve them. But when the 
two nations get together, they can be solved," he said, citing as examples aid 
to Mexico, Poland, Hungary and a multilateral assistance program for the 
Philippines that the United States and Japan launched last July. 
</P>
<P>
Bush persuaded Kaifu to meet him during a middle-of-the-night telephone call 
last Friday. The call came hours after U.S. officials expressed frustration 
with what they called their Japanese counterparts' lack of "political guidance" 
from Kaifu in pursuing talks to remove structural impediments to trade. But the 
prime minister told reporters that Bush raised none of the specific points that 
caused the frustration. 
</P>
<P>
Those points included a request that Japan raise its public works spending to 
10% of the gross national product within three to five years, abolish a law 
that protects mom-and-pop stores and revise its Anti-Monopoly Law to outlaw 
collusive business practices. 
</P>
<P>
If the President does take up these points, Kaifu said, he would reply by 
proposing "further discussions on the experts level." 
</P>
<P>
He said Japan began increasing its public works spending three years ago -- 
"even before the Structural Impediments Initiative began." His country, he 
added, recognizes that its infrastructure -- parks, housing, sewerage and the 
like -- lags behind other advanced nations. 
</P>
<P>
He insisted that Bush himself, both earlier this year and in the 
middle-of-the-night call, said he wanted to "discuss global problems, without 
setting an agenda." Bush assured him, Kaifu added, that he didn't intend "to 
try to make deals." 
</P>
<P>
" 'Let's have a frank discussion, without setting an agenda,' " Kaifu quoted 
the President as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomat who briefed reporters said the two leaders are expected to "give 
the Structural Impediments Initiative a stimulus and a direction" -- but 
nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu predicted that "frank discussions" he intends to have with Bush will 
"deepen understanding" of the measures Japan has been taking and the success 
that it has achieved. 
</P>
<P>
As examples, he cited a continued surge in domestic demand that has eliminated 
reliance upon exports for growth, and a reduction of Japan's trade surplus with 
the United States to $49 billion last year from a peak of nearly $60 billion in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
American exports to Japan increased 14.6% last year and 58.3% of the shipments 
were manufactured goods, whereas Japanese exports to the United States 
increased by only 4%, said Taizo Watanabe, the Foreign Ministry's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama said in an interview with the Japan 
Times that Japan must take "bold steps" in the Structural Impediments 
Initiative talks to prevent further deterioration of U.S.-Japan relations. But 
he added that "there are some things that Japan can do and other things that 
Japan cannot do." 
</P>
<P>
"Japan needs to say clearly to the United States what it cannot do," he said. 
He added that the timing is not right to make specific commitments now. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese diplomat warned that Kaifu will be going to Palm Springs "without 
any preparation" and will be unable to make commitments on specific trade 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't expect a miracle with only four working days for preparations," 
another diplomat added. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the abruptness of Bush's invitation, political turmoil in Japan 
since Kaifu's Liberal Democratic Party suffered an unprecedented defeat in an 
upper house election last July effectively shelved discussion of all domestic 
and foreign issues as the party prepared for the Feb. 18 vote. 
</P>
<P>
When Kaifu met Bush last September, he promised the President that he would 
implement policies based upon the interests of Japanese consumers. 
</P>
<P>
But the Asahi newspaper, in an editorial after the latest round of trade talks, 
condemned Japan for attempting "to get through the SII with the minimum 
possible reforms in order to protect vested interests at home." It warned that 
"Japan is in danger of allowing itself to be ostracized" by the rest of the 
world.

FENDER-BENDER HIT UKRAINE COMMUNISTS LIKE A QUAKE; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: THE ROUTINE ACCIDENT SPARKED A CITIZENS' EXPLOSION OVER PERKS FOR 
PARTY OFFICIALS.

CHERNIGOV, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a prosaic auto accident on the outskirts of the city, the kind of thing 
that just a few months ago would have been hushed up and gone generally 
unnoticed. But the "incident at Chernigov" on the eve of Orthodox Christmas hit 
the Communist Party like an earthquake, and aftershocks are still reverberating 
through the region. 
</P>
<P>
The accident and its aftermath sparked an explosion of public outrage against 
the special privileges enjoyed by the Communist Party leadership, leading to 
the ouster of six top officials in Chernigov and setting the pattern for 
similar party shake-ups elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, exactly what happened is a matter of dispute. All that seems clear 
is that a chauffeur-driven black Volga sedan, a symbol of the perquisites 
extended to the elite party functionaries known collectively as the 
nomen-klatura, collided with a small private car driven by an off-duty army 
officer near Chernigov, about 80 miles north of Kiev, the Ukrainian capital. 
</P>
<P>
The Volga belonged to a local party official, Valery Zaika, who was returning 
from his mother's house in Nezhin. One report said he was alone except for his 
driver, another that he was accompanied by his son and a third that he was with 
a mystery woman. 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt. The chauffeur was apparently drunk at the time and tried to 
run away, as one report had it, after removing the car's license plate. A mob 
gathered and began pounding on the Volga. Suddenly the trunk snapped open. 
</P>
<P>
Inside was a pile of Christmas gifts that made eyes pop in the crowd: sausages 
and other smoked meats, bottles of expensive liquor -- all "deficit goods," a 
Soviet euphemism meaning they are always out of stock in state shops. 
</P>
<P>
Enraged, the crowd dragged the Volga 3 miles to the center of Chernigov. A huge 
demonstration followed in front of the imposing marble building on Lenin 
Prospekt where the Communist Party has its regional offices. 
</P>
<P>
It was Jan. 6, the eve of Orthodox Christmas, and many of the demonstrators had 
been drinking. Still, for the Soviet Union, it was a rare moment. Anger built 
up over generations of deprivation boiled up into a public display. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a spark," said Vladimir Borisenko, who since the incident has 
become editor of the local party newspaper, Desnyanskaya Pravda. "The time was 
ripe. Shops were empty, there were no goods and no housing. People saw no 
changes taking place." 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations against the party continued for several days and began receiving 
press attention throughout the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian opposition group Rukh, formed last October, had been unable to 
generate much interest in Chernigov, a city of 280,000 not far from where the 
Ukraine meets the Russian republic and Byelorussia. But within two days of the 
incident, Rukh's membership in Chernigov increased tenfold to more than 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
"It just fell from the sky on our heads, and we benefited," said the local Rukh 
representative, Maya Voguslavskaya. "People were demanding not only more meat, 
but also more freedom. It grew from an economic complaint to a demonstration of 
political force." 
</P>
<P>
Staggering from the shock of the demonstrations, the regional party leadership 
held a plenum to consider personnel changes. Worker groups demanded that the 
entire 13-man leadership be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the party replaced the regional first secretary, the official 
responsible for ideology and the head of the party organizing committee, whose 
Volga had caused the scandal. In addition, three local officials were replaced, 
including the editor of Desnyanskaya Pravda. 
</P>
<P>
"The people were not satisfied with the changes because only three party 
leaders resigned," Voguslavskaya, the Rukh representative, said. "We demanded 
that they all go." 
</P>
<P>
The action taken in Chernigov was widely felt; party leaders began falling 
elsewhere in the Ukraine and the Russian Republic, under attack on charges of 
mismanagement and flaunting their special privileges. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan I. Leonov, the new ideology official in Chernigov, said in an interview 
that the special privileges were more fantasy than reality. He said that before 
he accepted the post, he and his wife grew their own vegetables on a family 
plot and had a hard time getting by. 
</P>
<P>
Leonov said the crowds on Jan. 6 were angered by the chauffeur's illegal 
actions after the accident, not the gifts in the trunk, which he insisted were 
given to the official by his mother and did not come from special shops for the 
party elite. 
</P>
<P>
But editor Borisenko described the demonstrations as "a mass attack on the 
party . . . strong and powerful," and he said the party "has done things which 
it can be criticized for." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, party officials were said to have had access to special 
health care while the rest of the people had to put up with a creaking medical 
system and that the party officials took expense-paid holidays in comfortable 
hotels, ostensibly attending advanced courses in communism. 
</P>
<P>
Borisenko said there is still a question about the first secretary's house, a 
mansion paid for out of party funds at a time when housing is desperately short 
in Chernigov. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the ousted officials are said to be hospitalized at this time, 
recovering from heart attacks and other ailments stemming from the upheaval in 
Chernigov. Others are in isolated retirement. None could be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal is expected to have a powerful impact on Sunday's elections for the 
Ukrainian Parliament and the local council. 
</P>
<P>
Chernigov has two parliamentary seats at issue, and in one contest the 
Communist Party is running 13 candidates against the Rukh candidate. In the 
other, the opposition candidate faces seven Communists. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I think these events shook the people," said Leonid I. 
Gerasimenko, a party member and head of a local election commission. "I was 
ashamed at our leader's behavior. The party should cleanse itself."

Southern African and British Commonwealth nation leaders affirmed Wednesday 
that sanctions against South Africa must be maintained until the path toward a 
negotiated political settlement is irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all agreed that sanctions must go on," President Kenneth Kaunda told 
reporters after a meeting between anti-apartheid leader Nelson R. Mandela and 
seven African presidents, Commonwealth officials and other leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings in Lusaka, the African National Congress' headquarters in exile, 
are Mandela's first extensive talks abroad since his Feb. 11 release from 27 
years in South African prisons. Kaunda, the 65-year-old leader of the 
six-member alliance of southern African's so-called front-line states, said the 
summit had agreed to abide by a U.N. General Assembly resolution in December 
maintaining sanctions at least until a review in July. 
</P>
<P>
If it appears that "we are now moving toward abolishing apartheid and that is 
now irreversible, then of course sanctions will be dropped," said Kaunda, who 
has hosted the ANC in exile for more than a decade. "If not, then we will pray 
for more sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela is to meet today and Friday with the executive committee of the ANC.

Mayor Marion Barry emerged Wednesday from five weeks of seclusion to plead not 
guilty to eight federal drug and perjury charges, then quickly returned to an 
exclusive South Carolina treatment center to further "heal himself" of 
alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
Immaculate in a wine-and-white tie and matching pocket handkerchief, the 
53-year-old mayor sat silently during the five-minute proceeding, rubbing his 
hands together slowly as U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered 
that his trial begin June 4. 
</P>
<P>
Barry made no public comments during his return to the city he has headed for 
nearly a dozen years. It was the first time he had set foot in Washington since 
shortly after federal agents videotaped him allegedly smoking crack cocaine 
with a former girlfriend in a downtown hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
The Jan. 18 arrest, and a later grand jury indictment charging that the mayor 
had used cocaine on another occasion and then lied about it under oath, set in 
motion a legal battle that has inflamed racial tensions in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy declared after Wednesday's hearing that Barry 
would neither resign nor negotiate a plea bargain and said the mayor was 
confident that he would be vindicated when his case came before a jury. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens dismissed the defense strategy as "standard 
not-guilty pleas" and said the federal government was continuing to investigate 
"a variety of related allegations" against the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department last week subpoenaed the financial records of several 
close Barry associates, and sources said the probe is now focused on reports 
that the mayor steered city contracts to the associates in exchange for 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The arraignment provided Barry with his first chance to respond formally to the 
Feb. 15 indictment, which contained five misdemeanor counts of cocaine 
possession and three felony counts of perjury. The charges carry a maximum 
penalty of 20 years and $1.25 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
Under the glare of fluorescent lights and the scrutiny of a packed courtroom, 
the mayor bowed his head and squinted as he read a copy of the charges. But he 
did not appear greatly troubled by them. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, the courthouse grounds were jammed with reporters and vocal supporters 
and opponents of the mayor. About 20 members of the crime-fighting group 
Guardian Angels carried signs urging Barry to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Barry held up two fingers in a victory sign as he entered the courtroom and 
later grinned broadly as he exchanged a word with Mundy. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor looked on impassively as his lawyer entered pleas of not guilty "on 
each and every count." 
</P>
<P>
The court appearance followed the postponement of a Feb. 21 hearing that was 
put off at the mayor's request on grounds that a return to Washington at that 
time would have interrupted his four-week rehabilitation program at a Florida 
alcohol and drug treatment facility. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, who has denied using drugs and has said he is being treated for 
alcoholism, has since moved to the Fenwick Hall Clinic near Charleston, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ordered Wednesday that Barry be released on his own recognizance, and 
he lifted a previous requirement that the mayor submit periodic urine samples 
for drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens said he accepted the judge's decision on the end of the mandatory drug 
testing as "appropriate" in light of the time that had passed since the mayor's 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Associates of Barry said the mayor returned to South Carolina after the 
arraignment to resume treatment, but his official spokesmen refused to comment 
on his movements. 
</P>
<P>
Mundy said Barry would remain in touch with city officials during his time in 
the South Carolina treatment center, but he asked reporters not to disturb him 
because "the mayor is seeking to heal himself." 
</P>
<P>
"As he continues to mend himself physically and spiritually, he will adhere to 
the program that has been set aside for this treatment," Mundy said. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the charges against Barry stem from a December, 1988, incident in 
which he is alleged to have smoked crack cocaine in a Ramada Inn hotel room 
with Charles Lewis, a convicted drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, whom the mayor has described as a friend, has said under oath that he 
provided crack to Barry and smoked the drug with the mayor more than once. The 
perjury charges against Barry stem from his sworn denials, in grand jury 
testimony, that he used drugs with Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment of the mayor followed a costly yearlong Justice Department 
investigation of his conduct, prompting Barry to charge that he had been 
unfairly targeted by Republican administrations and had become the target of a 
"political lynching." 
</P>
<P>
His supporters noted that the mayor was arrested only after being lured to a 
Justice Department trap in the Vista Hotel, where undercover agents videotaped 
a reunion between Barry and a former girlfriend, Rasheeda Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Barry has not yet announced whether he will seek reelection this year to an 
unprecedented fourth term, and his associates said Wednesday that they expected 
him to put any such decision on hold for at least another month. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Washington Post poll reported that seven out of 10 Democrats in the 
city do not want Barry to seek a fourth term, and half say he should resign 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
But the poll showed that about one in four Democratic voters in the district 
remained hard-core Barry supporters.

SENATE MIXES SIGNALS ON 'PEACE DIVIDEND' 
</P>

<P>
In the first skirmish of a new battle over how to spend the so-called "peace 
dividend," the Senate sent preliminary and somewhat mixed signals Wednesday on 
how it will allocate savings from anticipated major reductions in U.S. defense 
costs this year. 
</P>
<P>
A lopsided 79-19 majority first approved a Democratic plan that would earmark 
the multibillion-dollar savings in Pentagon outlays to balance the budget and 
then raise spending for "urgent national priorities" such as education, health 
care and anti-drug programs. Tax reductions for "working men and women" would 
get third priority under this plan. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, the Senate narrowly defeated a Republican alternative that would 
devote all of the savings from the defense budget to tax reductions, including 
a cut in the capital gains tax rate, once the federal budget is balanced. The 
vote was 50 to 48. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, the skirmish was a sham battle since the sense-of-the-Senate 
resolution adopted Wednesday is not binding and, as several senators said in 
the debate, a "peace dividend" may not emerge for years, if ever. 
</P>
<P>
But it indicated how closely the Senate is divided on whether tax cuts should 
have a higher priority than additional spending as Congress considers the 
budget in the wake of rapid easing of East-West tensions and the toppling of 
Communist regimes in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
It is not entirely a party-line issue, either, as the vote on the second 
resolution, sponsored by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), showed. Eleven Democrats 
voted with Gramm and seven Republicans voted against his proposal for 
allocating a "peace dividend" exclusively to tax reduction. 
</P>
<P>
On the resolution that passed -- sponsored by Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), 
chairman of the Senate Budget Committee -- 54 Democrats and 25 Republicans 
supported it while the 19 dissenting votes were all cast by GOP senators. 
</P>
<P>
While the vote was mainly symbolic, however, the debate was a preview of the 
controversy that is likely to go on for months and years over what to do with 
billions of dollars that would have gone for military spending except for the 
reduced Soviet threat in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's high time we quit squandering the treasury of this nation for overly 
sophisticated weapons systems," said Sasser. "We need to take this peace 
dividend and apply these funds wisely." 
</P>
<P>
Gramm countered that any funds cut from the Pentagon should be "returned to 
America's taxpayers" in the form of a higher personal exemption, a child care 
tax deduction, a lower long-term capital gains rate, repeal of the Social 
Security earnings test for retired persons, expanded research and development 
tax credits and other incentives for savings and investment. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we're all for tax cuts," Sasser replied. "I wonder why tax cuts for the 
wealthy are so wonderful and tax cuts for working Americans are not." His 
proposal advocated a third priority to tax cuts for "working men and women" in 
distributing defense savings. 
</P>
<P>
The Sasser resolution passed by the Senate also calls for using defense savings 
for balancing the budget first, followed by higher outlays for anti-drug and 
anti-crime programs, education, health care, the environment, rebuilding the 
nation's roads and bridges and giving aid to emerging democracies. 
</P>
<P>
Gramm argued that it would be "a great tragedy" to use any funds from defense 
cuts for expanding government programs. 
</P>
<P>
"The fruits of the success of freedom . . . should go to the people who won the 
Cold War, not to the government," Gramm said.

4% GOT DISABLING INJURY IN N.Y. HOSPITALS, STUDY FINDS;

RESEARCHERS SAY ONE-FOURTH OF THE INCIDENTS WERE CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE.

<P>
A major Harvard University study of medical malpractice has found that almost 
4% of patients sustained an injury resulting in disability while hospitalized 
in New York state, and more than one-quarter of the injuries were caused by 
negligence. 
</P>
<P>
The study, made public Wednesday, analyzed what happened to 30,121 patients 
admitted to 51 hospitals during 1984. It suggested that -- among the 2.7 
million patients actually hospitalized in New York that year -- thousands of 
deaths were caused by in-hospital injuries. 
</P>
<P>
It found that the risk of suffering an injury in a hospital increased with a 
patient's age, that negligence was 50% higher in government hospitals and that, 
although nearly half of all injuries occur in operating rooms, malpractice 
during surgery is less than in other areas of hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the project also indicated that hospital administrators continue 
to under-report incidents, including life-threatening events, to state 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is significant under-reporting today," New York state's health 
commissioner, Dr. David Axelrod, told a tumultuous news conference in Manhattan 
during which he was frequently interrupted by patients who asserted that they 
had suffered malpractice while being treated by physicians. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I do not believe there is a code of silence. I believe there is concern 
with the way the current malpractice system functions." 
</P>
<P>
Drug complications were the most common type of injury, accounting for 19% of 
the problems reported in the study. Antibiotics and anti-tumor drugs were the 
most likely to cause difficulties for patients, including allergic reactions, 
kidney damage, diarrhea, depletion of white blood cells or infection. 
</P>
<P>
The team of Harvard physicians, lawyers, administrators, nurses and 
statisticians who conducted the four-year-long, $3.1-million study said the 
results had implications for patients and health care providers in other 
states. 
</P>
<P>
"This will have important implications for society as a whole," said Dr. Howard 
H. Hiatt, professor of medicine at Harvard and former dean of the university's 
School of Public Health who participated in the study along with investigators 
from the Maxwell School of Syracuse University. "We can't undo what happened in 
1984. Our goal is prevention." 
</P>
<P>
The study was commissioned by the state's Department of Health as an offshoot 
of major reform in 1986 of the state's malpractice insurance act. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that 3.7% of patients who were hospitalized in 1984 received an 
injury in the hospital resulting in a measurable disability. Statisticians said 
this translated into 99,000 injuries among the 2.7 million patients who entered 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who were disabled, 28% of the injuries were caused by negligence, 
for a total of 27,000 patients, the study concluded. Most injuries were 
relatively minor -- 57% of patients recovered completely within a month, and a 
total of 70% recovered within six months. 
</P>
<P>
However, the study estimated that 14% of the medical injuries were fatal, and 
almost half of the fatalities were caused by negligence. The researchers said 
this percentage suggested that there were 13,451 deaths and 2,550 cases of 
permanent total disability resulting from medical injury in New York hospitals 
during the study year. They estimated that 6,985 deaths were caused by 
negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Age clearly was a risk factor. Patients over 65 years old, who often suffer 
complex medical problems, were judged to have twice the chance of being injured 
as patients 16 to 44.

THEY WERE PUT TO THE TEST AT BAR EXAM 
</P>

<P>
Fours years of college, three years of law school, months of study, and finally 
the moment had come to take the California Bar Exam. Nothing could rattle them 
now. 
</P>
<P>
Except an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of would-be California attorneys, pencils poised and hearts pounding, 
were close to completing the second portion of the three-day examination when 
the test was postponed in the wake of a 5.5 temblor that rolled through 
Southern California on Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sitting there, studying away," said Jonathan Foster, 26, a Harvard Law 
School graduate who was one of many taking the exam at the Los Angeles County 
Fairgrounds in Pomona. "And then suddenly you see people diving under their 
desks." 
</P>
<P>
Test takers were ushered outside and eventually told by officials to retrieve 
their belongings and go home, said Foster. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they didn't want to take the chance of those lights falling down and 
killing a would-be lawyer," Foster quipped, adding that they were instructed to 
be back, same time, same place for the third segment of the exam to be given 
today. It was not immediately known whether the second portion of the test 
would be given again. 
</P>
<P>
But some did not find the test's cancellation funny, saying that the earthquake 
may propel them into their first court case -- with them as the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
"This could really be a nasty situation," said one disgruntled law school 
graduate who asked not to be identified. He added that several of those who 
took the exam plan to collect names and phone numbers of their fellow test 
takers "in the event we feel we have to take some kind of action." 
</P>
<P>
He said he could not understand why the Bar, so meticulous about its testing 
procedures, had not given thought to what should be done in the event of an 
earthquake, especially in California "where quakes are so foreseeable." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's portion of the three-segment test weighs heavily in the exam 
process, he explained, because it is the only segment that is averaged with 
scores nationwide. California Bar officials could not be reached for comment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But Foster said the quake, if nothing else, made many realize that there are 
some things more important than passing a test. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard a few people say that it puts the whole thing in perspective," he 
said. "A few people felt their whole lives depended on this test. And now they 
figure that not having a light fall on them is a pretty good thing too."

a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you, the epicenter was right underneath this house," a shaken but 
nervously exhilarated Fry said afterward. "It knocked everything off the 
mantle. The TV fell off the shelf. The VCR toppled. It wasn't a roller -- it 
was more like an explosion. It was like a loud bang. 
</P>
<P>
"It scared the hell out of us." 
</P>
<P>
The quake caused widespread but generally minor damage in Upland -- fallen 
power lines, ruptured water and gas mains, toppled chimneys and cracked roofs. 
One home was destroyed in a fire that broke out just moments after the quake, 
but city officials late Wednesday reported only minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The Frys, who keep eight horses on property that includes a trout pond and 
waterfall, live in the last house on Mountain Avenue, a two-lane road leading 
toward Mt. Baldy. They were among those closest to the point where scientists 
pinpointed the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
As the jolt hit, the family -- including two of their three grown children and 
a granddaughter -- was gathered in the cozy, beamed-ceiling living room. A 
party was planned later to celebrate Bob Fry's 55th birthday. Yolanda Fry was 
preparing to put a dinner roast in the oven. 
</P>
<P>
The quake put an end to the plans. 
</P>
<P>
As she tried to flee the violently rocking house, Yolanda twisted a knee, which 
later became painful and swollen. 
</P>
<P>
"I was running out the door and the jolt just shook me into the doorway. It 
swayed me to one side," she said. "I twisted my knee and scraped my elbow. But 
mostly I was just scared to death." 
</P>
<P>
She planned to have the knee X-rayed today. Dinner, meanwhile, was scaled down. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of lost my enthusiasm," Yolanda Fry said. "Instead, we're heating up 
burritos that we had in the fridge." 
</P>
<P>
The strength of the quake was clearly visible in the rugged valley, which holds 
the dam and the dry-bed San Antonio River. Looking out from their hillside, the 
Frys could see vast dust clouds kicked up by the shaking. The dust engulfed 
their home, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole valley was a big cloud of dust," Yolanda Fry said. "You couldn't 
see a thing." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, hundreds of rocks and boulders -- some as large as four feet 
in diameter -- rained down from the hillsides onto the roadways. Bob Fry, 
seeing rush-hour traffic swerving dangerously to avoid them, worked outside his 
home to clear many of the rocks away. Caltrans vehicles later cleared the rest 
and reopened portions of the road. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the neighborhood, residents gathered in their yards to talk. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Bugarian, 27, who lives in a modest house on Mountain Avenue overlooking 
the dam, said she also was in her living room watching television when the 
shaking started. 
</P>
<P>
Her 2-year-old son came running in from the kitchen, horrified. 
</P>
<P>
"I was terrified," she said. "Little china birds fell to the ground and broke 
and glasses in my kitchen fell too." 
</P>
<P>
She had moved to Upland just eight months ago. After experiencing the 
5.9-magnitude Whittier earthquake in 1987, Bugarian had prepared for this one 
by putting aside batteries, a first-aid kit and a flashlight. As it turned out, 
she didn't need them this time. 
</P>
<P>
"But now we're really going to get prepared," she said, still visibly shaken 
about 90 minutes after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The quake caught some people near the epicenter in more vulnerable positions 
than others. Muffler mechanic Robert Smith, 25, was in a shop on busy Foothill 
Boulevard, working underneath a car -- but not for long. 
</P>
<P>
"I was doing the brakes on this car and the car suddenly started rocking like 
mad," he said. "I got out of that building quick. It was a hell of a shake." 
</P>
<P>
William Purdy, 29, a snowplow operator at Mt. Baldy ski lifts, said he felt a 
solid jolt and could hear rocks beginning to fall from the mountains and the 
sounds of a landslide around him. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of like it. It reminds me that this is God's Earth," he said. "I just 
kind of roll with it." 
</P>
<P>
Purdy said he looked around and saw no serious damage at the ski area. So he 
took a snowplow and went down to help clear rocks and dirt from Mt. Baldy Road. 
</P>
<P>
Purdy said parts of the road were completely covered. 
</P>
<P>
"The rocks, they were monstrous," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Former San Bernardino County Supervisor Cal McElwain, who lives on Mountain 
Avenue just an eighth of a mile from San Antonio Dam, was in San Bernardino at 
the time of the quake and quickly drove home to check for damage to his 
single-story stucco home. 
</P>
<P>
He had a radio blaring and was inspecting a framed needlepoint picture that had 
fallen off the kitchen wall and broken. Outside, a sheet of plexiglass had torn 
away from the framing of a greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly, I've just got pictures fallen off the walls and cupboard doors that 
fell open," McElwain said. "I must have closed about a dozen drawers, but I 
don't seem to have too much structural damage." 
</P>
<P>
Along Foothill Boulevard, a main thoroughfare into downtown Upland, concerned 
residents crowded around public telephones, since phone lines at many homes 
were not working. Mostly, they seemed relieved that the shaker hadn't been 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
Bill collector Vickie Thurman, 26, was one of them. She had just reached her 
husband and learned that he was safe. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like everything I own fell to the floor, and I'm scared, I'm 
jittery," she said. "But I think we all know it could have been a lot worse." 
</P>
<P>
Warren reported from Upland and Ferrell from Los Angeles.

SEISMOLOGY: WEDNESDAY'S TEMBLOR IS PART OF THE CONTINUING GEOLOGICAL TUG-OF-WAR

For millions of years, earthquakes such as the one that struck Southern 
California on Wednesday evening have been pushing and tugging at the Earth in a 
process that gradually created the San Bernardino and San Gabriel mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's earthquake, which was given a preliminary magnitude of 5.5 by 
Caltech and the U.S. Geological Survey, struck in rocky, hilly terrain that is 
highly fractured by various faults. The quake, centered three miles northwest 
of the San Bernardino County community of Upland, was the most common type of 
earthquake in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Seismologist Lucile Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey's Pasadena office said 
the quake struck in an area near the juncture of two faults, the Cucamonga and 
the Sierra Madre, but it could not be immediately determined which fault it was 
on. 
</P>
<P>
Caltech staff seismologist Kate Hutton described it as a "textbook earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
It was a left lateral strike-slip quake, meaning the earth moved in a 
horizontal rather than vertical direction and a person standing near the fault 
would see objects on the other side of the fault move to the left. The 
epicenter was about five miles below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Earthquakes in California are triggered by a complex pattern of stresses in the 
Earth's crust caused by the movement of two giant chunks of crust, called 
tectonic plates. The Los Angeles Basin is riding north on the Pacific Plate, 
which extends all the way across the Pacific Ocean. The boundary between the 
Pacific Plate and the North American Plate is marked by the San Andreas Fault, 
the largest fault in California and one of the most famous in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Earthquakes occur here because the two plates do not move smoothly along the 
San Andreas. They catch, like two pieces of sandpaper being rubbed against each 
other, and then suddenly slip from a few feet to a few miles, causing an 
earthquake. The amount of movement is the primary factor that determines the 
size of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's earthquake hit more than 20 miles away from the San Andreas on one 
of many lesser faults along the edge of the basin. 
</P>
<P>
The area near Upland had been seismically quiet until a 4.7 quake struck there 
in June, 1988. Since then it has been quite active with smaller quakes, 
including one foreshock at 12:39 p.m. Wednesday that measured 3.6. 
</P>
<P>
The main shock hit almost exactly three hours later -- at 3:43 p.m. -- and was 
followed by an unusually active period of small aftershocks. Most measured 
below 2 in magnitude, but a 4.8 aftershock struck at 7:24 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists said they expect aftershocks to continue for several days, and they 
could not rule out the possibility of a larger quake. Jones, of the USGS, said 
she believes faults in the area are capable of generating earthquakes as great 
as 6.5 to 7, but she does not "think it's likely" that a quake that large will 
follow Wednesday's temblor. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake tossed this huge boulder from a nearby hillside onto Angeles 
Crest Highway, about 25 miles north of La Canada Flintridge, moments before a 
school bus was scheduled to pass by. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
QUAKES AND THE LAND -- The push and tug of earthquakes -- over the course of 
millions of years -- gradually created mountain ranges. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's quake occurred in a complex seismological area at the juncture of 
two faults, the Cucamonga and the Sierra Madre. The quake was centered three 
miles northwest of Upland. The epicenter was about five miles below the 
surface.

OCTOBER'S BAY AREA EARTHQUAKE WAS MANY TIMES MORE POWERFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The magnitude of an earthquake is determined by measuring the ground motion 
that results from the quake, and a 5.5 quake like the one that struck Southern 
California Wednesday would be at least 60 times weaker than the 7.1 quake that 
devastated parts of the San Francisco Bay Area last October. 
</P>
<P>
Earthquake magnitude is measured on a logarithmic scale, so a 7.1 quake is 10 
times more powerful than a 6.1 quake and 100 times stronger than a 5.1 quake. 
</P>
<P>
When an earthquake hits, it sends out two general types of shock waves: surface 
waves, which travel along the Earth's surface and generally do the most damage, 
and body waves, which travel through the Earth. The fastest waves are body 
waves called compressional waves, or primary waves, and these are the waves 
felt first, usually as a sharp thud. They will be followed by secondary body 
waves, which arrive with a second jolt. 
</P>
<P>
Then comes the rolling of the ground caused by the arrival of the surface 
waves.

More than half of the $129 million spent on November, 1988, ballot measures was 
used to hire political consultants and purchase television and radio 
commercials, the state's political watchdog agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fair Political Practices Commission, reviewing $124 million in itemized 
expenditures of $500 or more, reported that 35% of the money -- $43.4 million 
-- purchased broadcast advertising. About 21% -- $26 million -- paid for 
political consulting services. Another 16% -- $20.2 million -- involved 
monetary or in-kind contributions to other political committees, primarily 
among the 15 committees battling over five insurance initiatives on the 1988 
ballot. The insurance battle over Propositions 100, 101, 103, 104 and 106 
consumed $91.3 million in itemized expenditures of $500 or more, the FPPC 
reported.

Twenty-one Californians have been arrested for buying animal parts, selling raw 
animal furs without a trapping license and poaching, the state Fish and Game 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrests were made in San Francisco, Humboldt, Modoc, Shasta and Orange 
counties, said DeWayne Johnston, chief of the department's wildlife protection 
division. During a 15-month investigation, two undercover agents bought and 
sold hundreds of pelts and animal parts. Many of the animals were trapped or 
shot out of season without hunting licenses. Some animals were on the federal 
endangered species list.

TIJUANA DROPPED FROM POPE'S FINAL MEXICO ITINERARY

Vatican officials have scaled down the scope of Pope John Paul II's scheduled 
trip to Mexico in May, canceling a number of planned stopovers, including a 
visit to the border city of Tijuana that many hoped would dramatize the plight 
of refugees and migrants. 
</P>
<P>
The final itinerary for the May 6-13 visit, said a spokesman for Archbishop 
Girolamo Prigione, the Vatican's delegate to Mexico, includes events in 11 
cities, including a meeting with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in 
Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, church authorities released a preliminary itinerary that included 
a stopover in Tijuana. But that visit was among a number canceled, a church 
official said, to streamline the Pope's schedule and allow more time at other 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
In Tijuana, word of the Pope's possible visit had prompted expectation that he 
would speak about the issue of migration, particularly the ongoing flight of 
Latin American economic and political refugees to the United States.

PRESIDENT SEEKS TO PLACE HIS 1988 MANTLE ON WILSON; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: IN CALIFORNIA SPEECHES FOR GOP GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, BUSH DEPICTS 
SENATOR AS A CRIME-BUSTER AND PROTECTOR OF THE ENVIRONMENT.

<P>
President Bush, intensifying the Republican Party's focus on the California 
gubernatorial race, sought Wednesday to impart on Sen. Pete Wilson the mixed 
mantle that served Bush successfully in the presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Bush depicted Wilson as a hard-nosed crime-buster, who believes "it's high time 
we took the shackles off the policemen, the courts and the law." But the 
President also described the Republican gubernatorial candidate as one who 
would "protect a fragile coastal ecology or educate a new generation of 
children." 
</P>
<P>
The themes worked well for Bush in 1988, when he turned Willie Horton, a 
convict furloughed from a Massachusetts prison, into a political metaphor for 
voters' fears of violent crime, and when he turned the murky Boston Harbor in 
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' political back yard into a symbol of environmental 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
With Wilson at his side at a $750,000 fund-raising dinner Wednesday evening, 
Bush gave the themes a try again. 
</P>
<P>
"California needs to continue a crime-fighting tradition, a Republican 
tradition," he said in his prepared text. But in his delivered remarks, he 
chose not to limit that tradition to his party, taking out the partisan 
reference. 
</P>
<P>
The "tough-on-crime" issue promises to be central in the race to succeed Gov. 
George Deukmejian. One of the candidates for the Democratic gubernatorial 
nomination, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, has emphasized her 
support for the death penalty, and the other candidate, John K. Van de Kamp, is 
the state attorney general and former district attorney of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
But in a state that has been graphically reminded of the threat of 
environmental damage with the Huntington Beach oil spill just three weeks ago, 
Bush also portrayed Wilson as an environmentalist. "He supports our America the 
Beautiful initiative to plant a billion trees, to expand our national parks and 
wildlife preserves, to make this more like the unspoiled green continent our 
forebears knew," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
The President made no mention of the extremely sensitive issue of how much of 
the nation's coastal areas should be opened up to offshore oil drilling. White 
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater has said that a presidential decision on 
the matter is several weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, in a brief introduction of the President, told Bush that as governor, 
he wanted to be "a partner" with him against drugs, for education and on behalf 
of child development. "In these things, we share a dream," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Wilson got help for his campaign from a former President, 
Ronald Reagan, who helped him raise about $200,000 at a luncheon in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has two days of appearances planned in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
Today, he will tour the new north Los Angeles County prison, a maximum-security 
jail built to house 2,064 inmates, attend a Republican Governors' Assn. 
luncheon at Jimmy's Restaurant in Beverly Hills, and address a 
100th-anniversary dinner of the California Chamber of Commerce at the Century 
Plaza.

ART BUCHWALD: TOBACCO INDUSTRY GOES TO THE DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been a bad time for the tobacco industry. First, it leaked out that they 
were developing a cigarette to appeal specifically to black people. When that 
idea ricocheted, they began concentrating on a cigarette for the young, 
blue-collar white woman. The cigarette, named Dakota, was being test-marketed 
to see if it would appeal to ladies who didn't have a high school diploma. 
</P>
<P>
This news did not receive the public reception the tobacco manufacturers had 
hoped it would. As a matter of fact, Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. 
Louis Sullivan assailed it. So the tobacco companies have now gone back to the 
drawing board to try to find another group that might pick up some of the slack 
in the smoking business. 
</P>
<P>
A meeting was held in the offices of tobacco consultants Ploughwright and 
Ploughwrong, who specialize in programs to further cigarette consumption in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Ploughwright addressed a tobacco mogul named Ziggy Slick. "We think that we've 
found the answer to the problem. We'll make a cigarette for pets. It's an 
untapped market. Our surveys indicate that there are more than 200 million dogs 
in American homes, and only a handful have ever known the joys of smoking." 
</P>
<P>
Slick said, "How the hell do you get a dog to light a cigarette?" 
</P>
<P>
Ploughwrong answered, "Who says the pet has to light it? It can just eat it. 
You don't care what anyone does with a cigarette as long as it is consumed." 
</P>
<P>
Ploughwright added: "We have given it a name that any dog will recognize. How 
do you like Fetch? We also plan to add a stick on the package in the center of 
the target. That way the dog will never mistake it for Lucky Strikes." 
</P>
<P>
Slick was dumbfounded. "It's going to take more than a stick on a package to 
get a dog to go for a cigarette." 
</P>
<P>
"Right. That's why the product has to have a strong advertising campaign. We 
have a TV commercial now that will blow your brains out. It shows a dog 
bringing in a package of Fetch to his master. The master takes two out of the 
pack and puts them in the dog's mouth -- and lights them. Then the master takes 
one of the cigarettes out of the dog's mouth and puts it in his own mouth. 
Everyone remembers that scene when Paul Henreid did it with Bette Davis." 
</P>
<P>
Slick said, "Dogs don't watch TV commercials." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you kidding?" yelled Ploughwright. "They're glued to the set all day long. 
The latest Nielsen ratings show that more canines than people are looking at 
network shows. We've got this whole thing worked out, Mr. Slick. We have to 
move fast before the other tobacco companies decide to go after the pet market, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Ziggy sounded unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, we got burned on the cigarette aimed at the black smoker, and we didn't 
do too well with the proposal to appeal to dumb girls who are only looking for 
a good time. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes you think that we won't be criticized for promoting our product 
using four-legged animals?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because," countered Ploughwrong, "we're promoting free choice. We are not 
suggesting that dogs have to consume tobacco. We're saying that it should be up 
to the animals themselves -- not to some bureaucratic Humane Society official 
who keeps telling them that cigarettes are dangerous to their health." 
</P>
<P>
Slick said: "Haven't they been doing laboratory tests with pets that indicate 
that after they smoked cigarettes, they got cancer?" 
</P>

CHATTY HACKERS; 
</P>
<P>
MAGAZINES: HARPER'S DRAWS COMPUTERPHILES INTO SPIRITED ELECTRONIC DEBATE ON THE 
ETHICS AND DANGERS OF BREAKING AND ENTERING DATA BANKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Don't look now, but you may have company. In your office. In your home. A 
visitor may, at this moment, be prying into the most intimate details of your 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
That intruder would be a computer hacker, and even if you don't own or work at 
a computer, he can probably "access" the facts of your life as they exist in a 
multitude of government and corporate data banks. 
</P>
<P>
By their nature, hackers tend to be hard to track down. So the editors of 
Harper's Magazine invited a few of them to chat via a medium they can relate to 
-- the computer bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
The forum was sufficiently intriguing that within three hours of launch, a 
Pentagon-funded anti-hacker group contacted Harper's to scold the magazine and 
to request unedited transcripts of the electronic conversations that occurred, 
senior editor Jack Hitt said. The request was denied, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how the forum worked: For 11 days, 20 well-known and underground 
computer wizards logged onto a Sausalito, Calif.-based computer bulletin board 
at their leisure. Guided by questions from Harper's editors, they discussed the 
ethics, dangers and potential benefits of electronic breaking and entering, as 
well as the implications of this budding technology on issues of privacy and 
free speech. 
</P>
<P>
One highlight in the discussion came when a former cattle rancher and 
Republican county chairman-turned-hacker and lyricist for the Grateful Dead 
offended a 17-year-old participant, known only as Phiber Optik, by comparing 
his rebelliousness to that of a skateboarder. 
</P>
<P>
Optik responded, according to Harper's, by quickly breaking into the computers 
at TRW and sharing with the other forum participants his antagonist's complete 
credit history. 
</P>
<P>
"Any fool knowing the proper syntax and the proper passwords can look up a 
credit history," Optik said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, according to these master hackers, gaining access to anything from 
White House data banks to Joe Citizen's electronic mail can be "a trivial 
undertaking." 
</P>
<P>
Many of these computerphiles argue -- not always convincingly -- that hacking 
is an honorable affair, a "moral obligation" even. 
</P>
<P>
"Since World War II, we've been governed by a paramilitary bureaucracy that 
believes freedom is too precious to be entrusted to the people," argues the 
aforementioned lyricist-hacker. "The government has become a set of Chinese 
boxes. Americans who believe in democracy have little choice but to shred the 
barricades of secrecy at every opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees. "The government is justified in taking extreme action to 
protect itself and the rest of us from you," one programmer snaps, 
electronically. 
</P>
<P>
In this forum, however, he was in the minority. As a hacker named Dave said, "I 
don't want any congressional King Georges treading on my cursor. We must 
continue to have absolute freedom of electronic speech!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MUST READ 
</P>
<P>
* The Los Angeles Times is a-changin', but for better or worse? Some reporters 
complain that it is leaning toward the spare McJournalism style of USA Today. 
Some East Coast types think it's too long-winded. In this week's New Yorker, 
Joan Didion ponders the matter for many pages and seems unable to reach a 
conclusion. She does deliver a nice history of the newspaper and its place in 
Southern California, though. 
</P>
<P>
* The February Manhattan Inc. also takes a look at The Times, in this case by 
examining the paper's new publisher, David Laventhol. Best quote on Laventhol: 
"He may look like an old sofa, but you have to remember they've got steel 
frames." 
</P>
<P>
* Ask one of the million or more people who have taken one of the increasingly 
popular personal growth seminars what it was like and they're likely to say, 
"You've just gotta experience it." Writer Paul Keegan did just that. In the 
February-March Boston Business he reports that the popular Life-spring training 
made him laugh, made him cry, and came darn close to transforming him into 
another happy graduate -- a breed he characterizes as blissfully compliant 
"zombies." 
</P>
<P>
* Are kids growing up too fast? The March Redbook asks that question 
rhetorically, already armed with a catalogue of figures to back up its emphatic 
answer: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
* The March Connoisseur offers Westerners a look at East Germany's "Communist 
Pleasure Domes," complete with photos. The magazine reached two conclusions: 
"Corruption on the extreme left usually cannot match that of the extreme right; 
and that when it does occur, the Communist general public is more shocked than 
we Westerners by it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
START THE SHREDDERS 
</P>
<P>
* People Weekly put eight reporters on the tail of alleged Trump femme fatale 
Marla Maples. They never tracked her down, but the March 5 issue does feature 
11 photos of Maples, including a cover shot, and six pages of stunningly sappy 
reportage. 
</P>
<P>
* With Sting exploring the rain forests, can Ralph Lauren be far behind? Not 
according to the March Vogue. The fashion industry is ready to face the 
environmental crisis, the magazine reports. How? By making hats out of lichen, 
for example. In another feature, the magazine devotes four pages to photos of 
leotards, vests, purses, gloves, belts and shoes made of exotic snakeskins. 
Endangered? Doesn't say. 
</P>
<P>
* In the March Esquire, 12 men reveal their feelings about the termination of a 
pregnancy they caused. How did abortion affect them? Their impassioned 
responses range, in essence, from "Gosh, quite a bit" to "Not much." 
</P>
<P>
* Pssst! Here's the dirt, as dished by the cover story in this week's Time: 
Gossip is back in vogue, darling. This is a refreshingly intelligent look at a 
dumb subject. But Time should know better than to use the oxymoron "gossip 
journalism." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW ON NEWSRACKS 
</P>
<P>
* Pleasure Quest -- "Your Success Guide to Sensual Adventures and Romance." 
This new quarterly, based in Mesa, Ariz., is just what the name suggests. 
Articles in the premier issue include pieces on vibrators, aphrodisiacs, 
massage, gambling, finding good work, and "the pleasure of a bubble bath for 
two."

ERMA BOMBECK: WHEN ALL THE WORLD WASN'T BOLTED DOWN

<P>
There was a time when I would climb into bed, reach over and shake my husband 
out of a dead sleep and shout in his ear, "Is the front door locked?" I could 
always count on him to throw back the covers, stumble through the darkness and 
check it out. He was back in a minute, a minute and a half tops. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that way anymore. By the time he has to check the lock on his gas 
tank, make sure the bicycles are padlocked to the house, turn on the outdoor 
spotlight, bring in the tapes from the car, throw all the dead bolts on the 
inside door, set the alarm, and make sure the cassette of the barking dog is 
set for "play," he's awake. Man's home may be his castle, but now he needs more 
than a moat to protect it. Today he needs a fortress. 
</P>
<P>
This is what we have become: a nation where people aren't so bent on taking it 
with them as they are hanging on to it while they're here. 
</P>
<P>
Have you any idea how much we pay for security? And what are we protecting? 
Have you ever used a pen in a post office or a bank that worked? They're drier 
than Arkansas on a Sunday afternoon, yet there's a chain attached to them that 
could support an anchor. 
</P>
<P>
And I love the roadside parks where a table weighs about 15 tons and is bolted 
to the ground. What do they think someone is going to do? Rent a flatbed truck 
at $100 a day and transport it to his back yard? 
</P>
<P>
You don't want to see the lamps and pictures that are screwed into tables and 
walls in hotels. Why would I want a sampan painted on velvet with an orange 
sunset or a lamp of a Nubian slave with the light switch buried in his navel? 
</P>
<P>
To crooks, it doesn't matter. I've read stories of people who steal garden 
hoses, hood, lawn and Christmas ornaments, pets and park benches. I stopped for 
a light recently in Los Angeles and glanced at the car pulled up next to me. In 
the window was a large note that read, "THE CASSETTE IS GONE. THE RADIO IS 
GONE. I'VE BEEN HIT FOUR TIMES. THERE'S NOTHING LEFT!" 
</P>
<P>
Good try. She was still driving on four tires with a transmission and a battery 
that worked. 
</P>
<P>
People are hard put to remember when thefts were so rampant. I remember only 
one incident when I was a kid. Someone stole the wash off our clothesline. The 
next day it was returned. We liked to think it was the wrong size.

OCCIDENTAL DENIES HIDING MUSEUM CONSTRUCTION COSTS; 
</P>
<P>
ART: EXECUTIVE ACKNOWLEDGES IN COURT PAPERS THAT INTERNAL MEMORANDUM DISCUSSED 
SHIFTING COSTS OF WESTWOOD FACILITY TO OTHER ACCOUNTS, BUT SAYS NO TRANSFERS 
WERE MADE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Occidental Petroleum Corp. on Tuesday denied that it ever attempted to conceal 
construction costs of a Westwood museum being built to house the art collection 
of company chairman Armand Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Asquith, the Occidental vice president in charge of construction of the 
Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center, said in an affidavit filed in 
Wilmington, Del., that allegations that Occidental engaged in a scheme to 
artificially lower the apparent cost of the museum "are false." 
</P>
<P>
"There has never been any plan," Asquith said in the affidavit, "to transfer 
museum construction costs from the museum account to elsewhere on Occidental's 
books to conceal the true cost of the construction." 
</P>
<P>
Occidental filed the court papers after attorneys for dissident shareholders 
accused the company of engaging in a "fraudulent scheme" to falsify the true 
amount required to build the museum. The shareholder lawyers filed their 
documents after The Times reported last week that Occidental had apparently 
decided to move millions of dollars in museum costs to other corporate 
accounting categories. 
</P>
<P>
Three pending shareholder lawsuits challenge Occidental's decision to build and 
endow the museum. A proposed settlement in one of the cases would require 
Occidental to limit construction costs to $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
Documents obtained by The Times indicated that the company had considered and 
decided to move some museum costs to accounting categories apparently related 
to renovation of Occidental's Westwood office building, the bottom four floors 
of which are being gutted and reconstructed as part of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
In the court filing, dated Tuesday, Asquith said an internal memorandum shows 
that he authorized a key separation of costs for the museum from costs to be 
attributed to a building maintenance account. But he said he discovered later 
"a mistake in the preparation of the minutes" of the meeting at which the 
decision was made. "I immediately recognized the error," Asquith said in his 
affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
The court filing consists of an affidavit by Asquith and a copy of minutes of a 
meeting at which Asquith contends he rectified his original mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The new court documents also confirm that Occidental and its contractors held 
discussions on whether to change accounting allocations for $2,266,066 in 
museum costs but that a proposal to actually switch the money was never carried 
out. 
</P>
<P>
The litigation is being handled by a Delaware court because Occidental is 
incorporated there. 
</P>
<P>
At the time the story was published, Occidental declined to respond to a set of 
written questions by The Times inquiring about decisions recorded in Occidental 
internal documents and specific amounts of money transferred from museum 
accounts to other bookkeeping categories. 
</P>
<P>
"These discussions (of transfer of the $2,266,066) related exclusively to an 
effort to ensure that Occidental's books were accurately recorded," Asquith 
said in his affidavit. "From time to time, there have been good faith and open 
discussions respecting the proper allocation of costs to the appropriate 
accounts, including discussions relating to a list of items comprising the 
$2,266,066 figure. 
</P>
<P>
"Such discussions were not part of any 'secret' scheme. There has never been 
any attempt to 'conceal' these discussions." 
</P>
<P>
Asquith emphasized that the current total budget for the museum includes the 
entire amount involved in discussions of shifting of costs from one account to 
another. Asquith said in his affidavit that, despite discussions of making such 
accounting transfers, none of the money involved was ever actually shifted from 
a museum account to a non-museum account. 
</P>
<P>
He said Occidental Petroleum established a separate subsidiary, Oxy Westwood 
Corp., and a separate account in the books for maintenance and tenant 
improvements in Occidental's 16-story office building. But Asquith specifically 
denied that the tenant improvement account had ever been used to conceal 
construction costs related to the Hammer museum. 
</P>
<P>
Asquith confirmed that Occidental efforts to drive down the museum construction 
cost had lowered the price of the museum from $78.4 million before top 
Occidental executives ordered massive reductions to a currently projected 
$59-million budget. Asquith also confirmed that the cost-cutting means the 
museum will open in November with its auditorium, restaurant and library 
unfinished. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, (the dissident shareholders') own papers acknowledge the fact 
that, to ensure Occidental's compliance with the $60-million cost limitation . 
. . work on certain items originally part of the project has been suspended." 
The affidavit identified the three facilities as among the suspended work, but 
noted that "it is my understanding that these portions of the museum will be 
completed if other funds become available." 
</P>
<P>
The Asquith affidavit also confirmed that Occidental had removed a $258,000 VIP 
reception lounge called the "Hammer Memorabilia Room" from the project, along 
with a $25,000 fireplace that would have been part of the lounge. "Such 
revisions to construction plans are a customary and appropriate method to 
adhere to a construction budget," Asquith said. 
</P>
<P>
"Thus, the budget process reflects nothing but Occidental's adherence to the 
$60-million settlement limitation," he said.

NBC'S '227' SITCOM HITS THE STREETS, HIRES HOMELESS TO PLAY THEMSELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Salas left his job as an extra on an episode of NBC's "227" about 
homelessness just in time to get some sleep -- in the Cameo movie theater 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Don Beckemeyer, who like Salas played a homeless man on the program, couldn't 
afford such luxury. He'd used part of the $3 that the producers gave him for 
transportation that day to buy cigarettes, so he couldn't afford the theater's 
admission. Instead, he spent Monday night after the taping walking the streets, 
explaining later that it's safer to walk them at night than to sleep on them. 
</P>
<P>
Beckemeyer and Salas were among 10 homeless men and women who had bit parts on 
an episode of "227" that taped Monday and Tuesday this week, hired as part of a 
campaign by the sitcom's star, Marla Gibbs, to bring attention to their plight. 
The episode, "No Place Like Home," which was co-written by Gibbs, will air at 
an as-yet-undecided date later this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to use the homeless people in the show so people could see them as 
human beings, and (know they were) not just actors," Gibbs said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
She said she got the idea for the program after watching a television news 
broadcast last winter that showed the frozen bodies of homeless people in 
another city being picked up by sanitation workers. 
</P>
<P>
In the "227" story, Gibbs' character of housewife Mary Jenkins undergoes a 
Scrooge-like transformation in her attitude toward the homeless after a dream 
sequence shows her what it's like to be on the street. She winds up meeting 
with Los Angeles homeless advocate Ted Hayes, who plays himself, and 
encouraging her husband, played by Hal Williams, to hire several homeless men 
for jobs at his construction company. 
</P>
<P>
But in interviews and discussions among themselves in the bare back room at 
Columbia Pictures' Sunset-Gower Studios, where they waited between takes 
Tuesday, they talked about the differences between their lives as seen on 
television and the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
They described a Los Angeles where intersections aren't known as "First and 
Main," for example, but "Rock Corner" -- where you go to buy cocaine -- or 
"Thieves Corner" -- "where everybody picks up different things and sells 
things." 
</P>
<P>
"They can't really show it all on television," Beckemeyer said. "There's no way 
to show everything that happens out there." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs, executive producer Irma Kalish and the others behind the "227" episode 
did their best to show how difficult life is among the homeless, Beckemeyer 
said, but much of what goes on "out there" just can't be shown. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't want to see winos drinking lying down," Salas agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Or the winos sitting there in front of you while you're eating a meal and 
(urinating) on themselves," Beckemeyer said. "Or someone throwing up in their 
food and then trying to eat it again." 
</P>
<P>
The program doesn't show the Plasma Centers, known on the street as places to 
make money. 
</P>
<P>
"You sit there for three hours with a needle in your arm, but you can get eight 
bucks for it," Beckemeyer said. "They take out your blood and then they remove 
the plasma and give you back your red blood cells. You can go every other day." 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Cortez, sitting next to Beckemeyer, added: "And those needles are 
really big." 
</P>
<P>
Beckemeyer nodded passionate agreement. He shoved up his sleeve to show two 
scabs in the crook of his arm. 
</P>
<P>
Homeless since he lost his job as an oil field worker in Texas, Beckemeyer said 
that he goes to the plasma center every Monday and Wednesday. He has a buddy 
who goes those two days plus Fridays, and the pair split the proceeds from that 
day because "you have to stick together on the street." 
</P>
<P>
One of the best parts of the "227" job, they agreed, was the opportunity to 
take showers at the studio. Besides the soap and water -- which left the 
homeless extras looking very comfortable and pleased -- the company also 
managed unwittingly to provide a chuckle. "They get us all clean and then they 
put us in our 'homeless' costumes," Cortez said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, they said, the wait for a shower at any of the local rescue 
missions can be several hours long, and includes a serious possibility that the 
bather's meager belongings -- including clothing -- will be stolen while he or 
she is washing. 
</P>
<P>
The jobs on "227" were arranged by homeless advocate Hayes, who said he 
voluntarily became homeless as part of his political commitment to their cause. 
Seven of the 10 extras -- including Cortez, Beckemeyer and Salas -- made $106 
per day for their appearances, and three who were given dialogue to speak made 
an undisclosed amount more. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs said that she hopes the jobs will lead to more work for the homeless in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that they did (the show), I'm hoping they can join the (Screen Extras 
Guild) union and some of the extra casting people will pick them up when they 
need people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Beckemeyer said he plans to pool his salary with a friend's relief check next 
month to try to get a cheap apartment. Hayes is sending his to his wife and 
kids in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Working on the show "gives me the opportunity to make some money, to try to get 
shelter, a place where I can stay clean," Salas said. 
</P>
<P>
But life in the business world brought one nasty surprise for these people, who 
are used to odd jobs and transactions such as plasma sales that pay cash -- and 
pay on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia won't have checks for them before a week or two, at the end of their 
regular pay cycle. And then there's the problem of cashing the checks: They 
will have to have an identification card, and at commercial check cashing 
centers, it can cost as much as 20% of the check's value to get it cashed. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we'd get paid at the end of the day," said Salas, who on Tuesday was 
preparing for another night at the Cameo. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's all right," he said. "You get to see a lot of movies."

The matter of anniversaries divisible by five has arisen again, compounded this 
time by the curious charm of a century divided into quarters. It was 25 years 
ago this very day that I took up my chores at the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
As usual on such an occasion the air is full of ghosts and memories, all tinted 
with astonishment that it has been so long. Yet it was only yesterday that I 
lugged a heavy suitcase through LAX, jet-lagged after the flight from London, 
to be met by my old friend Art Seidenbaum, already in residence, and the late 
Leonard Riblett, the assistant managing editor who had recruited me. 
</P>
<P>
The paper was doubling the space it gave to entertainment, Riblett had told me: 
from five columns a day to 10. There is now that much space for television 
listings alone and there are between three and four times as many of us keeping 
an eye on the arts, for a Calendar that has long since been a free-standing 
section. 
</P>
<P>
I reveal my antiquity by remembering that for many months I wrote my columns on 
a manual typewriter on a roll of teletype paper, an original and one carbon, my 
secretary Vi Stevens scrounged someplace. I required about 30 inches of the 
paper, double-spaced. I now gaze at an amber-lettered VDT screen, and the 
column is a screen and a half long. 
</P>
<P>
The other day I did some rough multiplication and came up with the appalling 
conclusion that I have written something well over three million words on these 
pages. Given their durabilities and their frequency, Jack Smith and Jim Murray 
would consider this a modest output, if they were to lay their own columns end 
to end. But the total lends a certain poignancy to my notion that writing for a 
newspaper is like carving your initials on the surface of a lake. Yet the 
trade-off, as between television and motion pictures, is the immediacy of what 
you do. 
</P>
<P>
It was coincidental, but it seems to me that I began my watch on the arts here 
in Southern California at an unusually interesting moment in history. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Warner, Sam Goldwyn and Walt Disney were still in place at the studios 
they built, and I interviewed them all. But Warner was already negotiating to 
sell his studio, Goldwyn was to make no more films and Disney died the 
following year. 
</P>
<P>
The last of the founding moguls were departing, and the golden age of Hollywood 
they had helped create had already changed fundamentally. The days of the 
contract players, the stables of stars, were gone. I remember doing a column 
with Chad Everett, the point of which was that he was the last and only star 
under contract at MGM. The film industry was learning finally to be the film 
and television industry, but it was a chaotic time. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Warner, in the Burbank twilight, did his part to push the movies into a 
new day, just as Warner Bros. had ushered in sound. He produced Edward Albee's 
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" in 1966. (I remember the launching party on 
the sound stage, Jack Warner holding court, Mike Nichols looking vaguely 
discomfitted, as if he wished he could just get on with the picture.) And 
Warner released it with a voluntary "Suggested for Mature Audiences" label, 
giving notice that a new day was at hand in the content of mainstream, major 
studio films. 
</P>
<P>
The tossing out of the old Hays Code with its onerous restrictions and its 
censoring powers and the adopting of a new ratings system in November, 1968, 
reflected many things: changes in the society's manners and mores over the 34 
years since the Hays Code became Hollywood law, pent-up demands for a freer 
hand in the creative community, court decisions about what was or wasn't 
allowable on screen and the competitive pressure of television. It was clear to 
the industry that the movies were going to have to change not only form (the 
wide screen) but content to lure audiences away from the television set. 
</P>
<P>
For all the excesses that followed, the gratuities of sex, violence and 
language, the new freedom of expression let the motion picture come of age as 
an art form. It has made this quarter century an extraordinarily exciting, and 
occasionally uncomfortable time, for movie watching. 
</P>
<P>
I recall the first press screening of "I Am Curious Yellow," all of the gents 
nervous and embarrassed because there was a woman present. (It was a long time 
ago.) I joked at the time that audiences attended because we were curious and 
not yellow. The film would, I suspect, now be found boring, but then it 
prospered from the considerable curiosity that the "legitimate" film could be 
so candid. 
</P>
<P>
(I remember a screening, for expert witnesses, of "Quiet Days in Clichy," 
seized at the docks as obscene and facing trial. After the screening, ex-Gov. 
Pat Brown shook his head and said, "To think I banned 'The Outlaw' when I was 
an assistant DA." It did measure the changes, at that. The film was acquitted 
because, the judge said regretfully, he couldn't prove it wasn't a seriously 
intended work of art.) 
</P>
<P>
By now the battles for the freedom of the screen seem largely, although never 
completely, to be won. Thinking back to the then-outspoken dialogue of 
"Virginia Woolf" and listening to almost any current film this side of "The 
Little Mermaid," we do appear to have come a long way. Mixed emotions are 
permitted, yet the power of "Born on the Fourth of July," for example, would 
have been unachievable not long ago. As a commentary on the Vietnam era, I 
couldn't help thinking how vastly far removed Oliver Stone's film was from 
"Riot on Sunset Strip," one of the quickie films exploiting the tensions of the 
time (at that, one of the few that reflected the times). 
</P>
<P>
It has been fascinating to watch television develop and flex its muscles, 
intermittently to be sure. Yet the immediacy of its globe-spanning news 
coverage has changed the course of history and probably done more than 
deterrence to give war a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
This has been a remarkable quarter century for the performing arts as well. The 
Music Center had just come on stream in 1965, the Shubert Theatre was yet to 
be. The Museum of Contemporary Art was at best still a distant dream. So was 
the dazzling Performing Arts Center in Orange County. But it was clear that 
there was a growing appetite for the arts, handsomely confirmed by the success 
of the Olympic Arts Festival in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
But, to paraphrase a line from a wildly different context, the arts are like 
housework, they never stay done. Success bounces around the studios and the 
networks like loose Ping-Pong balls. There is never quite enough money to 
sustain the arts as they should be sustained. There may or may not be a Beatles 
reunion, and there is a lively suspense always about how outrageous the next 
pop phenomenon will be. But meantime the best of the popular songwriters, long 
after Cole Porter, are still writing the ballads that speak to their 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not quite ready for another quarter century, thanks, but so long as the 
eyes, ears and spine hold out, I'd like to sit in on the proceedings a while 
more.

The goal of Indiana Jones' current crusade was to make No. 1 on the Billboard 
rental chart. Success! "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" toppled last week's 
leader, "Turner &amp; Hooch," which slipped to No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
"Lethal Weapon 2" moved up three notches to No. 2. What's shaping up in the 
next few weeks is a see-saw battle of the heavyweights, with "Indiana Jones" 
and "Lethal Weapon 2" bouncing in and out of the top spot. Don't be surprised 
if "Parenthood" sneaks by to take over the rental throne. "Parenthood," No. 5 
after just two weeks on the chart, should be up to No. 3 next week. "New York 
Stories," featuring a trio of short films by directors Martin Scorsese, Francis 
Ford Coppola and Woody Allen, is doing fair rental business at No. 15. 
</P>
<P>
* "Pink Cadillac," an action/comedy starring Clint Eastwood as a man who tracks 
down bail-jumpers, wasn't one of his big box-office hits, taking in just $12.1 
million. In the rental market it's no blockbuster either, inching up one notch 
to No. 13 after several weeks in the stores.

Lowe at Large: Now that his videotape scandal has died down, Rob Lowe is 
becoming more visible. This month's Interview magazine cover subject is 
scheduled to be a guest disc jockey today on WHTZ in New York and he will no 
doubt be the target of some jokes when he hosts "Saturday Night Live" on March 
17. Lowe's new movie, "Bad Influence," in which he plays a man who videotapes a 
couple having sex, opens March 9. CLAUDIA PUIG

Bush Cancels Paramount Visit: President Bush, who had been scheduled to take a 
tour of Paramount Studios this morning, instead will visit the new North County 
Correctional Facility in the hills below Castaic, the White House said. A 
spokesman said that the studio visit was scrubbed for logistical reasons and 
that Bush would still be able to talk to studio executives at a breakfast

Newman for the Defense: Paul Newman's legal rematch begins with jury selection 
Wednesday in Bridgeport, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Newman is being sued by a Westport deli owner who wants a share of Newman's 
food business because he claims he helped develop it. The first trial, which 
featured testimony from Newman himself, ended in a mistrial in 1988 after 
jurors were inadvertently given documents that had been ruled inadmissible. 
Newman denies that the deli owner helped develop his salad dressing and that he 
promised him a cut of his company's profits. CLAUDIA PUIG

SURVEY OFFERS UPBEAT VIEW OF BLACK EXPERIENCE IN AMERICA;

<P>
EXHIBITION: THE 25 ARTISTS IN USC'S 'CELEBRATIONS' SPEAK IN A DIGNIFIED VOICE 
ABOUT MUSIC, LABOR AND THE STRUGGLE FOR EQUAL RIGHTS.

<P>
Ralph Ellison once described the blues as "a lyrical expression of personal 
catastrophe," and the same can be said of much of the work in "Celebrations: 
Sights &amp; Sounds of Being." 
</P>
<P>
A survey of work by 25 black American artists on view at USC's Fisher Gallery 
through Saturday, "Celebrations" addresses the issue of the black experience in 
America in a remarkably upbeat way. Centering on the themes of music, simple 
labor and the struggle for equal rights, the work resists erupting into 
bitterness and rage, choosing instead to speak in a dignified voice that's 
often profoundly sad. A charmingly sweet and wistful show, it is however not 
without its problems. 
</P>
<P>
One could take issue with the ongoing ghettoization of black art, which is 
rarely seen outside the context of black-themed art shows, and has been 
systematically shut out of mainstream art history; shows such as this do little 
to change that. On the other hand, there's no denying that black art has its 
own very specific agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"Celebrations"' curator Samella Lewis describes the artists in this show as 
having been selected for their "consistent devotion to the concept of art as a 
means to educate," and the work does tend to be rather didactic. For instance, 
much of the work in the show dates from the '60s, a time when the art world was 
preoccupied with Pop and the black community was focused on the civil rights 
movement. Civil rights being a more pressing reality than the concerns of Pop 
art, it's not hard to guess which direction the black art of the period leans 
toward. At the same time, one should add that black art hasn't gone untouched 
by avant-garde trends, and the influences of funk and Cubism pop up repeatedly 
in the work on view here. 
</P>
<P>
Interspersing the artworks with quotes from leading figures from the black 
community (Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Toni Morrison, Paul Robeson), which are 
posted on the walls along with lyrics from blues songs, "Celebrations" attempts 
to paint a more comprehensive portrait of the black experience in America than 
one might glean from the art alone. It's a nice idea, and this supplementary 
information adds considerable depth to the show, which focuses for the most 
part on simple and straightforward artworks. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the exhibition is Mildred Howard's "Tap: Investigation of 
Memory," an installation piece involving 32 pairs of white shoes and hundreds 
of sets of taps arranged around an antique shoeshine stand. Based on Howard's 
childhood memories of her longshoreman father who shined shoes to supplement 
the family income, and her own experience as a member of her family's dance 
team (which also worked to help pay the rent), "Tap" pays homage to the 
countless blacks who worked overtime in order to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the show include several works by the late Romare Bearden, an 
artist born in 1914 in North Carolina who developed a vibrantly colorful style 
combining elements of collage, Cubism and folk art, and a handful of pieces by 
pioneering black woman artist Elizabeth Catlett. As the titles for her work 
suggest -- "Domestic," "For My People" -- Catlett worked in an unabashedly 
heroic, populist style typical of much Works Progress Administration art. John 
Biggers' "Washer Woman," a drawing from 1945 done in a similar mode, is 
evocative of Thomas Hart Benton in its mythologized depiction of everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
As always, splendid work by Alison Saar stands out as some of the finest in the 
show. Her three pieces here -- a painting on the back of a guitar, a mixed 
media assemblage, and a painting on tin -- pay tribute to black musicians, as 
do works by Howard Smith and William Pajaud. An assemblage from 1970 by Noah 
Purifoy suggests him to be under the influence of funk, while Floyd Coleman's 
mixed media works from the early '70s combining bold Pop motifs with African 
patterning bring to mind the hallucinatory writings of African author Amos 
Tutuola; Coleman's images are ripe with the pungent perfume of a shaman's juju. 
</P>
<P>
Mel Edwards offers a minimal metal sculpture from 1981 that demonstrates that 
you needn't be a white artist living in Manhattan to make boring anal-retentive 
art, while Margo Humphrey's lithograph "The Last Barbeque," transforms the Last 
Supper into a watermelon and grits party. It's the only overtly humorous piece 
in the show, but then, the black experience in America hasn't given anybody 
much to laugh about.

MORTALITY: Efforts to reduce the U.S. infant mortality rate have faltered (A1), 
but Orange County's figures are moving in the right direction. . . . Overall, 
deaths per 1,000 live births dropped from 7.6 in 1987 to 6.8 in 1988, according 
to the March of Dimes. . . . The "mortality gap" between white and black babies 
also is reversed here, with white infants dying at a higher rate than blacks, 
Latinos or Asians. Kristina Lindgren and Mark Pinsky

QUAKE FISH: Oscar, Corona del Mar High's famed earthquake prognosticating fish, 
wasn't around to forecast Wednesday's temblor (A1). . . . "Oscar bit the dust 
-- he took a deep-six on us about a month ago," said Principal Tom Jacobson. . 
. . The one-eyed South American red oscar died of "simple old age," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The legend of Oscar is that just prior to a quake, rather than swim 
vertically, he would swim flat on his side." His keeper, biology teacher Ron 
Schnitger, credited Oscar with correctly predicting up to 20 quakes in three 
years. There were no funeral services. Kristina Lindgren and Mark Pinsky

BRITISH PETROLEUM IS ACCUSED OF DRAGGING ITS FEET; 
</P>
<P>
OIL SPILL: THE STATE'S TOP ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT OFFICER AT THE CLEANUP 
SITE SAYS THE COMPANY OFTEN CLAIMED TO HAVE PERFORMED WORK THAT IT HAD NOT. A 
BP SPOKESWOMAN DENIES THE ALLEGATIONS. 
</P>

<P>
The state's top environmental enforcement officer for the Huntington Beach oil 
spill Wednesday accused British Petroleum of constant foot-dragging and of 
frequently claiming that it had performed oil spill cleanup work on Orange 
County's shoreline when it had not. 
</P>
<P>
Since Feb. 7, when the tanker American Trader spilled 394,000 gallons of crude, 
"it's been difficult to get specific commitments out of British Petroleum," 
said Reed Smith, a patrol lieutenant for the state Department of Fish and Game 
and California's on-scene coordinator for the spill cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"There were things that they said they would do but just weren't done," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
BP spokeswoman Marcia Meermans strongly denied Smith's allegations. The oil 
company, which owned the crude and has spent $12 million cleaning it up, "has 
been committed to assisting with the spill cleanup since Day One and we're 
committed to remain here till the job is done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's comments come a day after the commandant of the Coast Guard praised BP 
for being a "good corporate citizen" in helping clean up the spill in textbook 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith cited examples to the contrary. Chief among these, he said, was that 
nine days after the spill -- when beaches were still covered with oil -- BP 
indicated that it would begin to pare down its cleanup crews. Two days later, 
however, the oil company pulled out all 900 workers, Smith said, and sent its 
primary cleanup manager home to Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
The following Monday "was an ideal day for cleanup but no work was going on," 
Smith said. "They maintained they'd do what was needed to do. In fact, they'd 
stopped working." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that after he and other officials complained, BP returned about 400 
workers to the shore. Still, he said, the temporary shutdown resulted in 
additional damage to marine life. 
</P>
<P>
Meermans said that crews have been on the beach daily since the spill and that 
cleanup manager Jim O'Brien had intended all along to return from Louisiana 
after a brief visit. 
</P>
<P>
"All our actions have always been reviewed and approved" by the oil spill 
command group that includes Smith, she said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Smith, BP's failure to follow through began about three days after 
the spill when executives pledged to put protective booms at the the entrance 
of Upper Newport Bay, a wildlife refuge. 
</P>
<P>
"We believed it to be done and they said, 'We'll do it tomorrow.' And then it 
never was," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In another instance, state officials on Feb. 15 asked BP to wash oil-covered 
rocks along the Santa Ana River with warm water. "The oil removal there got 
started a lot later than we asked for it, perhaps Friday, Feb. 23," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Meermans countered that operations were "slowed somewhat" by foul weather; then 
the company had to demonstrate its rock cleaning plan to the Coast Guard on 
Feb. 21, fly in equipment from Alaska and train crews. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Smith said, 10 days ago, when sand and rocks from Newport Beach north to 
Bolsa Chica State Beach were still covered with oil, BP executives suggested 
that the company was ready to end its cleanup. According to Smith, one 
executive said, " 'We'll leave paper towels and cleaning compounds at the 
lifeguard stations.' " 
</P>
<P>
Meermans acknowledged that BP executives made the statement but said they meant 
that workers would withdraw "only after the beaches are approved and reopened" 
by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials did not return calls for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Adm. Paul A. Yost said the government made a "goof" by failing to 
require depth soundings at the offshore mooring where the oil tanker's hull was 
punctured when it ran over its anchor. Yost said it appears that the water 
around the mooring is shallower than indicated on nautical charts, which have 
not been updated since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, two state lands commissioners, Controller Gray Davis and Lt. Gov. 
Leo T. McCarthy telegramed Yost to request that he "immediately implement a 
policy requiring captains using these facilities to take current depth readings 
at the terminal before initiating mooring procedures."

1 Authorities today may reopen a 3-mile stretch of shoreline from near Warner 
Avenue to Magnolia Avenue in Huntington Beach if tests show no serious public 
health threat. 
</P>
<P>
2 Portions of shoreline south to Newport Pier are expected to be closed through 
the weekend for futher cleanup and and testing. 
</P>
<P>
3 Beaches from Newport Pier south to the entrance of Newport Harbor were 
reopened earlier this week after biological tests showed no lingering health 
effects from oil that washed ashore. 
</P>
<P>
4 The shoreline from Corona del Mar south to Crystal Cove State Beach is open, 
though healthofficials will continue to test samples of sand for possible 
health threats.

RECALL DEFEAT CALLED A SLAP AT DEVELOPER; 
</P>
<P>
MISSION VIEJO: OBSERVERS SAY THE VOTE WAS MORE AN INDICTMENT OF THE COMPANY 
THAT BUILT THE CITY THAN AN ENDORSEMENT OF COUNCILMAN ROBERT A. CURTIS.

<P>
City Councilman Robert A. Curtis' stunning victory in Tuesday's recall election 
demonstrated the suspicion Orange County voters hold for developers and 
illustrated the ineptitude of the Mission Viejo Co.'s attack against him during 
the campaign, political and development observers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Those same observers, however, were divided on whether Curtis' victory -- he 
took almost 70% of the votes cast in the recall battle -- reflected widespread 
endorsement of his slow-growth views. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a rejection of the Mission Viejo Co.," said Martin Brower, a former 
Irvine Co. executive who is now editor and publisher of the Orange County 
Report, a monthly newsletter that covers development issues. "It was people 
saying that they don't like to be told what to do by a major landowner." 
</P>
<P>
The final vote count was 8,679 votes against recalling Curtis to 3,835 in 
favor. Also on the ballot was Measure A, which requires that city voters review 
all large annexation proposals. It passed, with 10,570 votes in favor and 2,022 
against. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers compared the Curtis recall effort to Orange County's Measure M, 
a proposal that would have increased the sales tax a half cent for highway 
projects. The measure failed last year despite large developer contributions to 
the campaign. Like the Curtis recall effort, Measure M suffered from the 
association with developers, Brower said. 
</P>
<P>
"There does seem to be a very anti-developer feeling in this county, even if 
it's not properly placed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Mission Viejo Co., rather than maintain a low profile in the recall, 
contributed more than $300,000 to the effort, joining with other developers to 
put together a $500,000 war chest against Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Wetzel, a spokeswoman for the company, said officials there do not 
believe the money was wasted because it furthered debate on the issue of 
annexation, which the Mission Viejo Co. strongly opposes. Curtis proposed 
annexing Aegean Hills last year, and that proposal marked the beginning of his 
feud with the company. 
</P>
<P>
Other local developers and politicians, however, said they believe the recall 
effort damaged the Mission Viejo Co.'s image in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"I frankly don't understand why they did it," said Brian Theriot, director of 
investor relations for the J.M. Peters Co., a Newport Beach developer that last 
year contributed $3,750 to Curtis' council and anti-recall campaigns. "They 
really hurt themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, a well-known proponent of controlled growth, agreed. 
"When people begin to see money of that magnitude being spent in a campaign, it 
sends a signal to the ordinary voter that there is an effort under way to 
corrupt the political process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even Helen Monroe, who chaired the pro-recall Alliance for Mission Viejo, 
acknowledged that the enormity of the Mission Viejo Co.'s involvement may have 
indirectly hurt the Curtis recall campaign by allowing Curtis to focus on the 
company's involvement rather than on the issues behind the recall. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday, Curtis said he viewed the election as a mandate for 
tighter growth controls in Mission Viejo, and pledged to use his recall victory 
as an opportunity to reintroduce several slow-growth measures that found little 
council support last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to bring back some of my earlier proposals that were ridiculed and 
belittled," Curtis said, adding that he hoped the "tremendous support we've 
received in this election would convince the rest of the council that this 
community supports growth controls." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Curtis said he would again propose that the city freeze all new 
residential development and that it file suit in Orange County Superior Court 
to block an agreement between the county and the Mission Viejo Co. that governs 
the company build-out of the planned community. 
</P>
<P>
While several developers and political observers agreed with Curtis' contention 
that the election represented a major setback for the Mission Viejo Co., few 
agreed that the outcome represented a mandate for controlled growth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the furthest thing from the truth to characterize this as a slow-growth 
vote," Theriot said. "It was a statement against the heavy contributions of an 
established special-interest group." 
</P>
<P>
Buck Johns, president of the Newport Beach-based development firm The Inland 
Group, agreed. "I think this is an isolated, internecine dispute down there in 
Mission Viejo," he said. "I don't think that it holds any kind of a mandate for 
pro-growth or slow-growth." 
</P>
<P>
Slow-growth advocates were more inclined to attribute at least part of the 
margin of Curtis' victory to his views on development, but they too were 
cautious about reading too much into the outcome of the recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
Agran said he believes the margin of victory represents, to some extent, the 
voters' rejection of the "excessive, rapid-growth policies of the Mission Viejo 
Co." But, he added, "the more important factor is that voters expressed their 
disgust with major developers trying to manipulate the political process."

BLAST, FIRE IN MOTEL BLAMED ON DRUG LAB 
</P>

<P>
A suspected methamphetamine lab exploded in a La Quinta Inn motel room 
Wednesday morning, engulfing the room in fire and setting off a search for 
those connected with the operation. No injuries were immediately reported. 
</P>
<P>
Police say drug-producing labs in motel rooms, such as the one which apparently 
triggered Wednesday's explosion and fire, are not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fairly common to set up labs in motel rooms in urban areas," said Tom 
Wadkins, supervisor of the Orange County Laboratory Enforcement Team, a task 
force of the California Bureau of Narcotics assigned to investigate drug labs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been done this way for many years. Then these people don't contaminate 
their homes, and they can pack up and leave real quickly if they have to," 
Wadkins explained. 
</P>
<P>
Another narcotics expert supported that assertion. "I know that (portable labs) 
happen on a regular basis," said narcotics Detective Robert B. Phillips of the 
Costa Mesa Police Department. "These people go from hotel room to hotel room. 
They are very mobile. They usually get rooms in front or in back of the hotel. 
They make drugs, move out and check into another motel under a different name." 
</P>
<P>
However, one officer said Wednesday's drug explosion was a rare occurrence in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion and flash fire at La Quinta Inn, 1515 S. Coast Drive, caused the 
evacuation of about a dozen neighboring guests, police said. Police would not 
say whether anyone was in the room when the blast occurred. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department received an anonymous call from a man at 6:07 a.m. 
reporting the fire, Sgt. John P. Pherrin of the Costa Mesa Police Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When police units arrived at the motel along with the Fire Department, Room 219 
on the second level facing South Coast Drive was in flames, Wadkins said. 
</P>
<P>
The size of the explosion indicated that the lab could have been producing one 
to four pounds of methamphetamines, Wadkins said. 
</P>
<P>
He said it takes about two days from start to finish to set up a lab and cook 
the drug to completion. Such a lab poses an explosion and fire danger when 
fumes from volatile, drug-processing chemicals, such as ether and acetone, 
ignite. 
</P>
<P>
"They were converting the liquids into a crystal-type form," Wadkins said. "It 
would look like crystal salt. There were a lot of solvents used. You can make 
small quantities in about 12 hours." 
</P>
<P>
Found in the burned room were a microwave oven, an acetone bottle and other 
volatile fluids used to produce crack cocaine or methamphetamine. The explosion 
caved in a wall, and the fire destroyed the bed and scorched the carpet. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time," Wadkins added, "it appears it was an illegal drug lab." 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, "not in recent history have we had an explosion like this (in 
Costa Mesa)." 
</P>
<P>
No suspect has been arrested, but police believe that there is more than one 
involved. Police found articles indicating that both men and women occupied the 
room. Also recovered at the scene were stun guns, a .38-caliber gun and four 
knives. 
</P>
<P>
So far, no witnesses have come forward. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Orange County task force seized 30 methamphetamine labs, 
according to Wadkins.

EX-EMPLOYEE ARRESTED AFTER MAN IS SHOT

A disgruntled construction worker is suspected of having ambushed his former 
supervisor in a parking lot about 3 p.m. Wednesday, shooting him in the arm and 
chest, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, identified as Jody Dion Patterson, 26, was arrested at his home in 
Sun City in Riverside County several hours later on suspicion of attempted 
murder, police said. Matt David Mabry, 27, the superintendent of a construction 
site at MacArthur Boulevard and Fairchild Road, underwent surgery at Western 
Medical Center-Santa Ana on Wednesday night. Mabry, who lives in Victorville, 
is expected to survive, Police Lt. Mike White said. 
</P>
<P>
White said Patterson had recently been transferred to another job site, then 
laid off from Raymond Interior Systems in Orange. Witnesses reported having 
seen him loitering around the construction area earlier in the day before Mabry 
was shot in a nearby parking structure, White said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that he was waiting for him," White said. 
</P>
<P>
Mabry was shot as he was driving a pickup truck on the second floor of the 
parking structure, White said. The bullets, believed to have been fired from a 
rifle, struck Mabry from the passenger side of the vehicle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For three hours after the shooting, the intersection at MacArthur and Jamboree 
Road and also a short stretch of the Corona del Mar Freeway were blocked off as 
police searched for the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Police, believing that Patterson was hiding in the parking structure, used dogs 
and called in a SWAT team, White said. He was not to be found there, however. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County sheriff's deputies, working with Irvine police, went to 
Patterson's residence in Sun City and saw that he was inside, White said. SWAT 
teams from both departments surrounded the house. Investigators made contact 
with Patterson, who then surrendered without incident, police said. 
</P>
<P>
This is at least the second time in less than two months that a disgruntled 
employee has been named as a suspect in the shooting of an immediate 
supervisor. On Jan. 12, a former auto mechanic at El Gato Auto Repair in Santa 
Ana fatally shot Alfonso Romero, who had been his boss, and wounded two other 
people after being told he was fired.

TRIBE SOUGHT TO HELP REBURY STORED BONES

<P>
A state Indian agency will work with local tribes to help rebury Indian bones 
that are now stored in a Santa Ana warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
The Native American Heritage Commission in Sacramento will determine which 
tribe is the most likely descendant of people whose remains were found by 
archeologist Arthur Sanger on San Nicolas Island in the 1950s, said Larry 
Myers, director of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will talk to representatives from the Gabrielino tribe from 
Catalina Island and the Chumash tribe from the Channel Islands to make the 
determination, Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
Sanger left the bones to his niece, Betty Feldman, who stored them at a 
warehouse in an industrial park on South Edinger Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers Museum officials learned about the bones three weeks ago when a woman, 
who did not want to be identified, contacted officials after her son was hired 
to move several boxes of Indian bones to the warehouse, said Paul Apodaca, 
curator for the museum's folk art department. 
</P>
<P>
The woman told museum officials that the bones were tossed about during the 
move, Apodaca said. 
</P>
<P>
"The woman thought that it was undignified for the Indian remains to be loaded 
in boxes and fooled around with," Apodaca said. 
</P>
<P>
Apodaca then contacted the coroner's office, which referred the case to the 
state commission after investigators determined that the remains were not 
homicide-related. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Coroner Bruce Lyle said Feldman had legal ownership of the bones. 
Feldman has agreed to release the bones to the commission, which will find the 
appropriate tribe to take them, Myers said.LILY ENG

$267,000 AMASSED FOR FREEWAY SOUND WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The residents of Leisure World have passed the halfway point in their quest for 
a sound wall to reduce traffic noise from the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"We have hundreds of people whose lives are dramatically impacted by the 
noise," Seal Beach Councilman Joe Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
"In certain areas of Leisure World, there's no such thing as opening your 
windows." 
</P>
<P>
The fight for the $550,000 sound wall is being led by Hunt and Councilwoman 
Edna Wilson, who persuaded the council to loan Leisure World $100,000 for the 
project. The Golden Rain Foundation has loaned $100,000 for the project, and 
Leisure World residents have contributed $67,000. 
</P>
<P>
Residents plan to ask the Orange County Transportation Commission for the 
$283,000 still needed. 
</P>
<P>
Leisure World's sound wall request is 159th of 200 projects waiting for state 
funds from the California Department of Transportation. Without private 
funding, Hunt said it could take 20 years for the wall to reach the top of the 
list. 
</P>
<P>
The city is working to put together enough money to build the wall now. The 
loans would be repaid when Caltrans decides to fund the project. MICHELLE

<P>
$2.49 MILLION ENDS TRAILER PARK SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of legal battles, the owners of Fountain Valley Mobile Estates have 
agreed to a $2.49-million settlement of a suit filed by more than 100 residents 
who claim that the park wasn't maintained and that rents were increased 
unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
Checks were sent this week to 123 residents of the park who were among the 
remaining plaintiffs in the suit, said David Semelsberger, their attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"These people were primarily over the age of 70, and many were on a fixed 
income," Semelsberger said. "They were more likely to suffer emotional 
distress." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the money, the settlement provides for a 6% cap on rent 
increases annually over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Semelsberger, who said he has represented residents in dozens of similar cases 
in the state, said the action was "one of the best settlements we've had" 
because, in addition to the money, it includes the rent curbs. 
</P>
<P>
Residents filed the suit in 1986, alleging that owners of the park had breached 
an agreement made six years earlier that limited rent increases to the yearly 
rise in the consumer price index, Semelsberger said. In 1985, rents were hiked 
$50 twice, which made the increase 10% higher than the rise in the index, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents complained that rents had doubled in the past 10 years and now 
range from $500 to $600 a month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not totally satisfied, but we're comfortable that we've gone as far as 
we can go with the case," said Dale Evans, 61, who lives in the park and is the 
chairman of the residents' legal committee. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Olander and Fred Nyquist, the principal owners of the park, directed 
questions about the settlement to the Orange County Manufactured Housing 
Educational Trust, an industry group representing park owners. 
</P>
<P>
Vickie Talley, the executive director of the group, said the settlement 
"doesn't admit liability for either side." 
</P>
<P>
Talley said that Olander and Nyquist were certain that they could prevail if 
the case had gone to trial but didn't want a legal battle that could have gone 
on for three or four more years. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also alleged that the owners failed to repair electrical, gas and 
sewer systems and that roads and lighting in the park were not kept up, 
Semelsberger said. He said that since the suit was filed, owners have put money 
into the upkeep of the park. 
</P>
<P>
But Paul Pirilla, the owners' attorney, denied that the suit caused them to 
improve maintenance, saying it always has been adequate and that he considers 
the area "one of the most beautiful mobile home parks in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
After filing the suit, residents refused to pay for increases above the 
consumer price index. Instead, their money was put into a trust that totaled 
$391,000. 
</P>
<P>
Semelsberger said the trust money went to the residents. But Pirilla said that 
the trust fund will go to the owners of the park and that no such agreement was 
made in the settlement. TED JOHNSON

SCHOOL EMPLOYEES TO KEEP PICKETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Negotiators for about 800 non-teaching employees who are locked in a contract 
dispute with the Anaheim City School District say they will continue to picket 
meetings of the Board of Education until a state mediator arrives next month. 
</P>
<P>
At issue are this year's pay increases: The district has offered the employees 
a 6% raise and the employees are holding out for 7%. 
</P>
<P>
An impasse in negotiations was declared at the end of January, and a state 
mediator is scheduled to conduct three meetings with the two sides in April. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the employees say they plan to demonstrate -- as they did last 
month -- with picket signs and bullhorns at the twice-monthly board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very hopeful that the board will be personally involved with the 
mediator in settling this," said Jack Ashley, a field representative for the 
California School Employees Assn. "After that process is followed, I won't rule 
out anything. The employees are upset." 
</P>
<P>
District Supt. Meliton Lopez said he feels confident that the pay issue will be 
resolved quickly with the help of the mediator, and that the employees will not 
feel a need to strike. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to think we have a good relationship with our employees," said Lopez. 
"I hope we're not at the point where there would be a work stoppage." LISA

POLICE SEEK SUSPECT IN ATTEMPTED RAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police are seeking a suspect in the attempted rape of a woman as she was 
jogging alone through a neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing nothing except a dark-colored baseball cap, the man grabbed the 
25-year-old woman as she was running east on Deerfield, near Fawn Glen, shortly 
before 9 p.m. Tuesday, Irvine police said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman escaped when she managed to break free, and the attacker fled into a 
cluster of nearby townhomes. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, still at large, is described as Caucasian, in his 20s, about 6 
feet tall with a medium build and a flabby waistline, police said.

2 STREETS TO BE USED FOR HAULING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Large tractor-trailers will be using Birch Street and Brea Boulevard to carry 
dirt and rocks to a construction project until the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
Trucks will use the streets from Monday through Friday during the day, 
traveling west on Birch and south on Brea to the southwest corner of 
Bastanchury Road, where the rubble is being used for a development there, 
according to Assistant City Engineer John Hogan. 
</P>
<P>
A street sweeper will operate continuously to keep the streets clean and dust 
to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
The material comes from the Laurel Creek project at Birch and Ash Street and 
the old high school site on Birch. 
</P>
<P>
Residents with questions or comments about the operation should contact Hogan 
at (714) 990-7657.

CITY TO SPEND $3,000 TO PLAN NEW SIGNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted this week to spend $3,000 to begin planning a pedestrian 
traffic signal at the busy intersection of Knott and Danbrook avenues, but 
residents who have been pleading for a signal in recent weeks said the council 
did not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
"Once again, it appears we are getting the runaround," said resident Joe Van 
Gilder. 
</P>
<P>
"As Anaheim citizens, we deserve to be protected." 
</P>
<P>
The residents at the meeting urged the council to move faster on the project by 
approving $45,000 to install the signal. 
</P>
<P>
The intersection is among the city's top 10 priorities for a signal, and city 
plans had called for the signal to be planned and built in fiscal 1991, which 
begins July 1. The council's decision to spend $3,000 allows the planning to 
begin this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
A temporary sign with yellow flashing lights was installed at the crossing 
about two weeks ago.

TWO-WHEELERS A BIG DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
BICYCLING: MORE COUNTY RIDERS ARE HITTING THE HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS FOR FITNESS, 
FREEDOM AND FUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember when you got your first driver's license and swore you'd never pedal 
your bike another inch? Remember when even the 10-year-old family station wagon 
had more status than the most expensive Italian racing bicycle? 
</P>
<P>
But now when you're spending too much time behind the wheel, and you spot a 
lean cyclist on the road with the wind blowing in his face, the lowly bicycle 
-- that vehicle you once thought was the quintessential symbol of immaturity -- 
somehow has risen in stature. It now represents physical and mental fitness, 
self-discipline and, even freedom. 
</P>
<P>
For an ever-increasing number of Southern Californians, cycling means more than 
just another idle promise to lose a few pounds. More and more people are 
cycling to regain a portion of their youth and lose a portion -- the one 
hanging over their belt -- of their adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
And it seems that once they've made the commitment to give cycling a try, many 
are turning into fanatics. 
</P>
<P>
Unless, of course, you don't find a 100-mile jaunt to San Diego for the day 
fanatical. And if you don't, that probably means you're among the growing 
number of serious "recreational" cyclists who curse their busy schedules 
because sometimes they can only get in a 100 miles a week. 
</P>
<P>
"As recently as four or five years ago, you could ride the Santiago Canyon Road 
(connecting El Toro and Orange) and you'd see two or three other groups of 
cyclists," said Ed Everett, a 24-year-old from Orange who recently opened a 
bicycle shop in Mission Viejo. "Now on Saturdays and Sundays, it's just one 
long, constant stream. It's unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if these people are riding around the block a couple of times and 
calling it a workout, either. A number of California centuries (100-mile 
rides), such as the Solvang Century scheduled Saturday in Solvang, draw more 
than 3,000 cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
What's the fascination? Why are so many people spending every spare minute 
riding the thin line between pleasure and pain? 
</P>
<P>
Bill Leach, an Olympic kayaker and former All-American in water polo at UC 
Irvine who is now one of the world's top-ranked master triathletes, provides a 
number of reasons . . . some of them somewhat contradictory. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I like the freedom and the speed of bicycling," he said. "It's a 
great outlet for stress and frustrations and, of course, there's the fitness 
aspect. But you can't underestimate the aspect of solitude. It gives you time 
to be with yourself and enjoy your surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, there's the social part, too. It's a great way to see things with 
your family or spend time with friends." 
</P>
<P>
Most cyclists prefer not to ride alone and, as a result, clubs are flourishing. 
The Capistrano Ciclistas, one of many Orange County clubs, was formed in the 
mid-1970s during the last cycling resurgence. It remained active with a few 
die-hard members through the doldrums of the early '80s, but its roster has 
increased in recent years to 80 members. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Neville of San Clemente joined Capistrano Ciclistas when he decided 
bicycling would be a good way to reverse the effects of smoking two packs of 
cigarettes a day for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Cycling is an endorphin popper," he said. "It brings you in tune with 
yourself, with your abilities. The mechanical application is also intriguing. 
The bicycle is a beautiful piece of equipment." 
</P>
<P>
Neville, who quit his job and began his own business as an advertising and 
marketing consultant specializing in cycling, pedals at least 130 miles a week. 
</P>
<P>
But he still curses his old habits when pushing his way up a tough hill. "Peter 
can be very bad-tempered on hills," said Rock Kendall, of Dana Point, smiling. 
"You don't want to talk to him on hills." 
</P>
<P>
Kendall, who started cycling as a training regimen when he was racing 
catamarans, says he now rides more than he sails. He believes most noncyclists 
believe the misconception that long-distance riding is a form of torture. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to exert yourself to the point of pain," Kendall said. "You 
gradually work your way up. I'm riding in my first century this weekend, my 
last hurrah before I turn 40 this June, but I don't expect it to hurt. I hate 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to ride so much because it's fun. You're outside in the sun with your 
friends. The camaraderie is the best part of it." 
</P>
<P>
And being outdoors seems to add to the calming effect of all that exercise. 
When cyclists talk about health clubs, they cringe at the thought of gulping 
air conditioning when you can work out with fresh air filling your lungs. 
</P>
<P>
Even a few whiffs of exhaust fumes won't change their minds. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still lots of places in Orange County where you can ride without 
traffic or signals, especially down by the beach," said Larry Keller, a 
computer consultant from Huntington Beach. "I don't mind riding alone, either. 
I have a lot of pressure in my job and this is a great release. Who needs a 
psychiatrist when you've got a bike?" 
</P>
<P>
Alone or in groups, cyclists share a common fear: accidents. They are not 
uncommon and they are often serious. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who's been on a bike more than a few hours can tell you about 
situations where they could have been really hurt," Leach said. "I really think 
that's one of the attractions for some people, the thrill that comes with 
taking chances, with testing oneself. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I still see people who don't wear helmets and that's just plain 
stupid . . . or insane." 
</P>
<P>
Leach's wife, Julie, teaches a recreational cycling class at Irvine Valley 
College. She starts by showing her students how to change a tire and works her 
way to effective gearing techniques. But she stresses defensive riding and 
safety, and helmets are mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
"The new hard-shell helmets are so cool, comfortable and light that there's 
absolutely no excuse not to wear one," she said. "You can't even tell it's on 
after a while." 
</P>
<P>
Serious cyclists won't downplay the risks, but they invariably will tell you 
that the benefits far outweigh the liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone I know has been hurt except me," said Pam Weiss of San Juan 
Capistrano, pointing to the raspberry on the knee of companion David Swerdlin, 
who had recently been caught in a squeeze play between a truck and a curb. "And 
no, I don't get any excitement from the danger. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss says she is aware that only 12% of cycling accidents involve a car and 
that road debris and other cyclists cause more mishaps. Still, she would rather 
deal with a stray beer bottle than a straying Buick. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry more about cars than trash," she said. "I'm pretty confident I can 
survive an accident caused by road debris." 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-eight million Americans ride bicycles, but only 5 million to 10 million 
do it on a weekly basis. Are they lazy or afraid of traffic? 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose it would be safer to ride a stationary bike, if you can stand the 
health-club scene," said Ron Klefbeck, president of the Capistrano Ciclistas, 
"but there's no downhills and I wouldn't be riding if it wasn't for the 
downhills. 
</P>
<P>
"And I don't care what kind of fancy TV monitor you've got in front of you, 
riding a stationary bike is boring." 
</P>
<P>
OK, so you've decided to pedal away your frustrations, worries, stress and 
excess pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Now what? Get out the checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
You'll need a bike ($250 to ($1,800), a helmet ($30-$100), biking shorts 
($30-$150), gloves ($10-$30), road cleats ($60-$300) and sunglasses (Oakley 
Factory Pilots look cool for about $70, but almost any pair will do). 
</P>
<P>
A tire repair kit, frame-mounted pump and water bottle are also near-mandatory 
items. 
</P>
<P>
All of these cycling accessories do more than make you look the part. The 
shorts prevent chafing; gloves add comfort and reduce abrasions in a fall; 
shoes enhance comfort and efficiency, and the sunglasses reduce the effects of 
ultraviolet rays while providing protection from airborne debris. 
</P>
<P>
It's also advisable to buy your bike from a bicycle shop because fitting is 
important. An ill-fitting bike can result in any number of aches and pains and 
even cause numbness in the hands. 
</P>
<P>
Most cyclists who pedal long distances prefer the regular road frame (what used 
to be called a "10-speed"), but the newer mountain-bike style is growing in 
popularity because the rider sits more upright, which many find more 
comfortable than the hunched over style of the road cyclist. 
</P>
<P>
Some hybrid cycles, merging the road and mountain-bike designs, are on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get a quality, entry-level bike for $400," said Tracy Sledge, a 
salesman in a Laguna Beach bike shop. "And get a helmet the same day. Shorts 
should probably be next, and make sure you get a pair with a good liner that 
will keep the moisture away from your body. After that you can add gloves and 
shoes." 
</P>
<P>
For many, however, investing the money will be less painful than investing the 
time.

"You want to start easy and keep it fun, but I see more and more people 
sticking to it," said Julie Leach. "I think people are more motivated now 
because they're more health conscious. Things I was learning in college, like 
the impact of cholesterol levels, are common knowledge now. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are getting bored with health clubs and what's more healthy 
than fresh air? And cycling is a lot more comfortable than running." 
</P>
<P>
This time of the year, cyclists all over the country are looking out windows at 
snow drifts. But here in the Southland, the rolling masses are chalking up 
hundreds of miles each week. 
</P>
<P>
And every day, more decide to go along for the ride.

Jon Upham sat on the bench, his head buried in his hands, trying to sort out 
what had happened in the last 18 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Upham, a 6-foot-4 forward, made two free throws with 18 seconds remaining in 
overtime to give Corona del Mar a 38-37 lead over Dos Pueblos in the Southern 
Section 3-A championship game Wednesday night at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
As he ran downcourt, Upham believed that he had scored the game's winning 
points. 
</P>
<P>
But that honor would belong to the man he had been covering on defense, Dos 
Pueblos' Chris Gaines, who scored with two seconds remaining for a 39-38 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines, who scored seven of his game-high 22 points in the overtime, cut 
through the right side of the baseline as the clock began to wind down. 
</P>
<P>
Upham followed. But when Gaines received a pass on the left wing, Upham wasn't 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
"They set a double pick for him on the baseline," Upham said. "He got open and 
pulled up." 
</P>
<P>
The ball fell through the net and Dos Pueblos had the victory. "I felt pretty 
good after those free throws," Upham said. "But you have to give Gaines credit. 
He hit a clutch shot." 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar called timeout after the shot, but officials said the game was 
over. 
</P>
<P>
"When I turned around and looked at the clock, there were two seconds left," 
Upham said. "Jeff Jackson turned and called a timeout, but the ref said time 
had run out." 
</P>
<P>
Upham wasn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we deserved a chance with two seconds left," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Official Frank Johnson, who saw Jackson's timeout, said he raised his hands to 
signal the call to the scorer's table, looked up at the overhead scoreboard and 
saw that time had expired. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar Coach Paul Orris said his team should have had a final shot. 
</P>
<P>
"How many overhead scoreboards do you see in high school games?" said Orris, 
who questioned the time it took for Johnson to see the clock. "In that 
situation, you can't tell me it takes that long after the balls goes through to 
call time. We had all five guys calling timeout." 
</P>
<P>
As Gaines' teammates mobbed him at halfcourt, Upham walked back to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
He had covered Gaines for most of the second half, holding him to three 
second-half points before the overtime. Gaines had 12 points, five rebounds and 
four blocked shots in the first half as the Chargers took a 22-15 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Jon had done a great job on Gaines in the second half," Orris said. "That's 
what got us back in the game. He had to work hard just to get the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Gaines worked overtime. He scored all of the Chargers' seven points in the 
extra period. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive year that the Sea Kings have lost in the 3-A 
championship game. Trabuco Hills beat them, 59-55, last season. 
</P>
<P>
Upham wasn't sure what to believe as he walked off the court. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked hard all year," he said. "It's too bad it had to come down to this."

FUERBRINGER BLOCKS SERVITE'S PATH TO TITLE

<P>
With three seconds left in overtime, Servite High School went for it all. 
Trailing by two, the Friars' Paul Stapleton set up for a three-point field goal 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
But the shot had barely left Stapleton's finger tips when Matt Fuerbringer 
reached out and swatted it into the corner. 
</P>
<P>
The play preserved a 51-49 overtime victory for Estancia High School in the 
Southern Section 3-AA championship game at the Bren Center Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
For Fuerbringer, it was vindication of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday in the semifinals, Fuerbringer had tipped a three-point field goal 
attempt against Lompoc. However, the ball went in to tie the score and send the 
game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Although Estancia had won in triple overtime, Fuerbringer has been haunted by 
that shot. 
</P>
<P>
"If you tip a shot, it shouldn't go in," Fuerbringer said. "If I hadn't touched 
it, the shot wouldn't have been close." 
</P>
<P>
But the incident against Lompoc was the furthest thing from Fuerbringer's mind 
when he charged Stapleton Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A little more than 30 seconds before, Stapleton had hit a three-pointer from 
the exact spot to tie the score, 49-49. Fuerbringer lunged at Stapleton, but 
got there too late. 
</P>
<P>
After Agustin Heredia made two free throws with seven seconds left to give 
Estancia a 51-49 lead, the Friars worked the ball up the left side. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw it was the same play they had burned me on before," Fuerbringer said. "I 
didn't think I was going to get there in time to block the shot. I thought he 
was going to make it and we were going to lose. So I just jumped." 
</P>
<P>
It was Fuerbringer's second blocked shot of the game. He also scored eight 
points and had a team-high eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's game was not his best performance in the playoffs, far from it. 
Fuerbringer has averaged 17.7 points, nine rebounds and four blocked shots per 
game in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
However, Fuerbringer, a 6-foot-4, 155-pound sophomore, was able to hold his own 
against the Friars' tall front line. He battled Steve Marusich, Servite's 6-7 
center, to a standstill. 
</P>
<P>
"Matt has come through for us at the right time,"' Heredia said. "Every team 
needs a big man. Matt's ours. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a gutsy move by Matt on the blocked shot. What if he fouls the guy?" 
</P>
<P>
But Fuerbringer wasn't worried about a foul. 
</P>
<P>
"What if he makes the three-pointer?"

CORONA DEL MAR COMES UP SHORT AS TIME RUNS OUT

<P>
After the initial uproar, the shock and the tears, Corona del Mar High School 
point guard Mark Flint quietly offered his opinion regarding the controversial 
finish of Dos Pueblos' 39-38 overtime victory over Corona del Mar in the 
Southern Section 3-A title game Wednesday night at the Bren Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Realistically," Flint said, "are we really going to score with two seconds to 
go?" 
</P>
<P>
Who'll ever know? 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar's Jon Upham had made two free throws that gave the Sea Kings a 
38-37 lead with 18 seconds to go in overtime. Dos Pueblos then fired back with 
a 18-foot fade-away jumper by Chris Gaines to give the Chargers a 39-38 edge -- 
and, as the referees ruled, the victory as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the amount of time on the Bren Center clock -- which unlike most high 
school clocks hangs high up over the center of the court -- that caused the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking there were at least two seconds left after Gaines sank his shot, 
Corona del Mar players tried to call a timeout. But referee Frank Johnson 
signaled that time had expired. While Sea King Coach Paul Orris rushed onto the 
court to argue his case, and his players stood, some stunned, some ready to 
play, Dos Pueblos started its celebration. 
</P>
<P>
For the Sea Kings, there was only frustration and second-guessing. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Gaines) shot it with four seconds," Orris said. "There's two seconds left. 
. . . That's the problem with clocks up there, the refs can't see it. . . . How 
many gyms in this area have clocks up there? In that situation, someone's got 
to be watching it with five guys trying to call a time out." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dos Pueblos Coach Eric Burkhardt: "There are a lot of calls that go one 
way or another. I looked up and saw the clock running down. I saw 0 on the 
(clock). We're just so excited to win . . . " 
</P>
<P>
In the end, two seconds or no two seconds, Gaines was the major difference. He 
scored all seven of Dos Pueblos' points in overtime, and finished with a 
game-high 22. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar, which trailed by as much as 11 points in the first half, 
rallied in the third quarter for a 25-24 lead, and entered halftime with a 
26-26 tie. But four critical fourth-quarter turnovers and two missed free 
throws by Flint hurt the Sea Kings. After Dos Pueblos failed to score after a 
full minute's possession, the teams ended regulation at 32-32. 
</P>
<P>
In overtime, CdM's Warren Johnson (14 points) made two consecutive 15-footers 
from the baseline, but Gaines scored on a free throw, an inside bank shot and 
then made both ends of a one-and-one to give Dos Pueblos a 37-36 lead with 1:06 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
And while a Dos Pueblos timeout wasn't enough to shake Upham in between his 
one-and-one with 18 seconds to go, Gaines, working off a two-man screen, had 
the final say with his off-balance jumper. 
</P>
<P>
"In retrospect," Orris said, "When (Gaines) came under that screen. . .if we 
could've just stepped under and shoved him over. . .or. . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard. You want another opportunity. We saw one thing, they saw something 
else. It just happens. When it comes down to it, the kid hit the shot." 
</P>
<P>
Dos Pueblos' total points was the lowest for any winning team since 1961, when 
Santa Clara beat Brea-Olinda, 39-25 in a 1-A title game. Dos Pueblos, which 
entered the game as an at-large entry from the Channel League, improved its 
record to 16-13. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar finished at 19-10.

<P>
So maybe it wasn't the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
But that didn't stop UC Irvine's players from rushing to congratulate winning 
pitcher Ken Whitworth after the last out of the Anteaters' 3-2 victory over USC 
in a nonconference baseball game Wednesday at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Whitworth finished off a complete game by striking out pinch-hitter Danny Gil. 
Whitworth allowed five hits and walked two, raising his record to 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine improved to 10-6, its best start since going 13-3 in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"It put us on the map," Whitworth said of defeating USC, which is 12-4 and the 
top-ranked team in the Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball polls. "We've 
won eight in a row. I don't want to say that some of them were weak sisters, 
but this one was nice." 
</P>
<P>
Whitworth got help from the usual source: Osmar DeChavez. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman DeChavez led off the fifth inning with a single to right, then 
moved to second when Craig Plumley singled off the outstretched glove of 
shortstop Billy Morris. Don Roberson's sacrifice bunt moved the runners up to 
second and third with one out. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bardens grounded to Morris, who threw to catcher Sam Vranjes in plenty of 
time to tag an onrushing DeChavez. DeChavez barrelled into Vranjes and the ball 
fell out of his glove, giving Irvine a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Plumley, who took third on the play at the plate, scored on Mike Goodcase's 
sacrifice fly to left for a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Vranjes atoned for his error when he tripled and scored on John Jackson's 
ground out in the sixth inning, to make the score 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
DeChavez struck again with a two-out, two-strike single to score Al Rodriguez 
in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
At the time it seemed like a cushion, 3-1, but in the bottom of the inning 
Vranjes, who was one for three for the season, hit a 405-foot solo home run to 
center to make the score, 3-2. ARA NAJARIAN

SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE SERIOUS CYCLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The novice cyclist can buy all the right equipment and wear all the right 
clothes, but it will take lots of time on the road to build endurance . . . not 
to mention, conversational savvy. 
</P>
<P>
Talking intelligently about cycling can be tough. 
</P>
<P>
And you certainly want to say the right things between pulls off the water 
bottle, right? 
</P>
<P>
Just so you'll know what concerns the serious cyclist, here's a sampling from a 
recent questionnaire in Bicycling magazine: 
</P>
<P>
 -- What's the best food before a long ride? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What's the best food after a long ride? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Where's the worse place on your body to get road rash? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What's the best-tasting sports drink? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What's the worst make of car that can pass you on a narrow road? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What's the best way to get grease off your hands? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What's the best cure for chain suck? 
</P>
<P>
This all may sound intimidating, but after you put in a few hundred miles, 
you'll have opinions -- and probably first-hand experiences -- to relate. JOHN

DECHAVEZ TAKES STEPS TO CHANGE HIS LUCK ON FIELD

<P>
He got rid of No. 13. He hasn't shaved in weeks. And he insists that a 
particular teammate punch him in the chest before each at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
But don't call Osmar DeChavez, UC Irvine's hot-hitting first baseman, 
superstitious. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not, really," said DeChavez, who now wears No. 24. "Or at least I don't 
think so. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I've grown this beard, we haven't lost, so it's on until we do. 
Hopefully, I'll be wearing a really big (beard) at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, there's the guy (freshman Craig Plumley) who hits me in the chest before 
I go up to bat. (Tuesday) he forgot, and I flied out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't take these things seriously. I mean, I'm just kidding around. But it 
does work." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the senior is doing, it's working. After a miserable season last year, 
in which he had a .213 average, DeChavez is batting a team-high .460 this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (10-6), which upset top-ranked USC, 3-2, Wednesday, has an eight-game 
winning streak, its longest since 1974, when the Anteaters won 32 in a row and 
won the NCAA Division II title. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, the Anteaters have improved since last year, especially DeChavez. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was such a horrible year -- I was one for 31 at the start of the 
season," DeChavez said. "This year, I started out 0 for five. As soon as I got 
my first hit, I felt this huge weight lifted off my shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
It was enough to boost DeChavez to a four-for-four performance in Irvine's 4-3 
victory over Chapman that day. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, DeChavez says, it has all been a matter of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's a mental game," he said. "I have a new attitude this year. I worry 
less about my average and think more about what will help the team. I mean, if 
I go 0 for four, but can get a man from second to third -- whatever it takes to 
help us win -- that's better than helping my average." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some college players who hope for pro baseball careers, DeChavez says he 
has never thought about it, even though his older brother, Oscar, played three 
years in the Oakland Athletics' organization. 
</P>
<P>
After batting .430 during his senior year at Katella High School, Osmar applied 
at Irvine -- but only with education in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to convince him to come out for the team," Irvine Coach Mike Gerakos 
said. "He really didn't believe he would be able to handle the baseball and 
academics at the same time. We had him meet with some counselors to convince 
him he could. We still chuckle about that." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball obviously hasn't hurt his studies. DeChavez, an economics major, has a 
cumulative grade-point average just above 3.0. He finished with a 4.0 last 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I got lucky," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine men's tennis team, 6-4 and ranked ninth in the nation, will play No. 
6 California at 1:30 p.m. today at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Cal is expected to move up to the No. 2 after finishing second to top-ranked 
Stanford last week at the National Indoor Team Championship in Louisville, Ky. 
Irvine reached the semifinals of that tournament before losing to Stanford, 
6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine defeated No. 5 South Carolina and No. 4 LSU before losing to Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Brian Pajer was named the Big West Conference swimmer of the year after 
last week's conference championships. 
</P>
<P>
Pajer, who will compete in the NCAA championships March 22-24 at Indianapolis, 
set conference records in winning the 100- and 200-yard breaststroke races at 
the Big West meet. His time in the 100 (54.26 seconds) is the fastest in the 
nation this season. He swam 1:32.84 in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's other victory was in the 200-yard medley, with freshman Yusuke Bannai, 
Pajer, sophomore Jeff Klatt and junior Mat Curry. 
</P>
<P>
Divers Trishna Coleman and Holly Powell will compete in the NCAA regional 
diving championships March 9-10 at Provo, Utah.

PG&amp;E TO OPEN FIRST NATURAL GAS STATION FOR PUBLIC IN BAY AREA 
</P>

In an effort to encourage use of cleaner automobile fuels in smoggy California, 
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric plans today to open the state's first compressed 
natural gas refueling station with public access. 
</P>
<P>
The "gas" station, at the giant utility's service center in the East Bay city 
of Concord, is expected to supply fuel primarily for fleet vehicles. It will be 
open 24 hours a day, with customers using a card key to gain access. The 
station will feature a drive-up island where natural gas will be pumped into 
tanks in the vehicles much as gasoline is. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Bryan, the PG&amp;E vice president heading the utility's alternative fuel 
program, said the station will be the first of seven that PG&amp;E will open to 
the public this year. The others will be in Bakersfield, Hayward, San Jose, San 
Rafael and Sacramento. There will be two in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
PG&amp;E is taking the lead on providing public access, Bryan said, "to give 
the public experience" using the fuel so that the benefits will become 
apparent. Experts say the fuel costs about 30% less than gasoline, emits far 
fewer pollutants and cuts vehicle maintenance costs because motor oil and spark 
plugs need changing less frequently. 
</P>
<P>
The station opens at a time lawmakers in Washington are embroiled in 
controversy about what measures to take and which fuels to use to clean up the 
nation's increasingly filthy air. President Bush in June proposed a 
far-reaching plan to curb smog, acid rain and toxic emissions, but aspects of 
the plan involving "clean fuels" have met resistance in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
PG&amp;E began experimenting with using natural gas to fuel its own service 
vehicles in 1973, according to Bryan. In 1986, it opened two CNG refueling 
stations to service 100 of its vehicles that had been converted to run on 
either natural gas or gasoline. Drivers of "dual-fuel" vehicles can easily 
switch from one power source to another while driving. 
</P>
<P>
But PG&amp;E's "big push" began late last year, Bryan said, as the clean air 
debate took center stage. "We began to realize that our fuel could provide 
significant environmental benefits," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The investment for PG&amp;E is significant. Each station costs $100,000 to 
$300,000. In addition, the company plans to convert an additional 100 vehicles 
to "dual fuel" this year. Such conversions generally cost $2,000 to $2,500 per 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Finding an adequate market for the fuel has not proven easy. Bryan said county 
agencies and private delivery fleets have expressed interest in converting 
fleets of trucks and buses, but so far only Fresno County has actually agreed 
to shift some vehicles -- five to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
To date, only 30,000 vehicles nationwide are equipped to run on natural gas. 
The number has barely budged the past couple of years because relatively stable 
oil and gasoline prices have dampened the enthusiasm for alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem with natural gas has been a "chicken and egg" situation, 
according to Julie H. Stewart, a spokeswoman for the American Gas Assn., a 
utilities trade group in Washington. Because there are so few refueling 
stations, she said, manufacturers have not mounted a concerted effort to build 
vehicles that run on natural gas. Car makers, instead, have concentrated on 
cars that can run on methanol. 
</P>
<P>
The Concord station is "really the beginning of what we hope will be a much 
more sophisticated infrastructure that will encourage conversion of fleets," 
said Jeffrey Seisler, executive director of the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition, 
a Washington lobbying organization. He added that most of the 275 CNG refueling 
stations nationwide are owned by companies or government agencies that use them 
strictly for their own vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of natural gas point to signs of progress. Amoco recently became the 
first major oil company to support the natural gas effort. It negotiated with 
Colorado utility officials to put in natural gas pumps at four stations in the 
Denver area. It also will put one on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Gas will soon begin temporary operation of a natural gas 
facility in Sunland to fuel 10 experimental RTD buses. In addition, the company 
has had discussions with Chevron and Unocal about opening natural gas pumps, 
"but we don't have any plans ourselves" to open natural gas refueling stations, 
said Ralph Cohen, a spokesman for the utility. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Sessa, a spokesman in Sacramento for the California Air Resources Board, 
viewed today's opening of the PG&amp;E station in Concord as welcome news. The 
board recently proposed a plan to accelerate the shift to cars powered by 
cleaner fuels. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to underscore that there are alternatives," he said.

3 U.S. FIRMS MAY TEAM UP TO MAKE COMPUTER SCREENS 
</P>

<P>
Several U.S. electronics companies are considering forming a cooperative 
venture to develop and produce advanced display screens for portable computers 
and, potentially, high-definition television sets. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions, which reportedly include such giants as Sun Microsystems, 
Compaq Computer and Apple Computer, represent the most recent attempt by U.S. 
high-technology companies to band together to reduce their reliance on Japanese 
suppliers of key components needed in products ranging from new commercial 
computer systems to everyday home electronics. 
</P>
<P>
The latest proposal centers on liquid crystal displays, a technology commonly 
used in wrist watches, radios and a variety of electronic gear, including the 
latest miniature television sets and most advanced laptop computers made in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Early plans call for the proposed cooperative to create "computer and other 
commercial products" from liquid crystal display research developed at the 
David Sarnoff Research Center, the Princeton, N.J., laboratory that pioneered 
the technology in 1968. Japanese companies have long since taken over 
development of the market, now running at $3.8 billion per year, and are the 
dominant suppliers of LCD screens. 
</P>
<P>
Although such a venture could reduce dependence of U.S. companies on Japanese 
suppliers, participants in the talks labeled them "early stage" and cautioned 
that the proposed venture is still quite "tentative." Those Japanese suppliers 
in many cases are direct rivals to U.S. computer firms in such emerging fields 
as high-definition television and portable computers. 
</P>
<P>
News of the latest talks comes less than six weeks after seven U.S. computer 
companies were unable to win sufficient support from other high-tech firms to 
back a similar cooperative venture, called U.S. Memories, that would have 
produced key computer memory chips. That market is also dominated by the 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
None of the U.S. companies reportedly interested in joining the display screen 
venture would comment on the discussions. However, representatives of the 
Sarnoff Center confirmed that talks are under way in the hopes of creating the 
cooperative by year-end. Sources familiar with the discussions said the venture 
could require $30 million to get off the ground and $100 million to begin 
full-scale production. 
</P>
<P>
Liquid crystal displays are considered superior screens because they offer 
great clarity with low power. In addition, the screens, made by sandwiching 
liquid crystal between two sheets of glass that have been coated with 
transparent electrodes, are flat and lighter than the cathode ray tubes used in 
current television and computer models. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to seeking an immediate commercial application for its liquid 
crystal display technology, the Sarnoff Center is pursuing two other 
independent research programs involving high-definition television and high 
definition computers. 
</P>
<P>
The laboratory, once the research arm of RCA, is a partner with National 
Broadcasting Co., N. V. Phillips and Thompson Consumer Electronics in a project 
to develop standards for high-definition television transmission and reception 
in the United States. And, late last year, Sarnoff was teamed with Sun 
Microsystems and Texas Instruments to develop a high-definition computer 
workstation by the Defense Department's research and development office.

New Financial Agency Proposed: State Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose) 
introduced legislation that would put banks, savings and loans, credit unions 
and other financial institutions under the supervision of a single state 
agency. He said combining the departments of banking, corporations, real estate 
and savings and loan into a Department of Financial Institutions would provide 
better enforcement.

Dart Group Settles SEC Complaint: Corporate raider Herbert Haft's Dart Group 
settled an SEC complaint alleging that it had acted as an investment company 
because it made large profits from the sale of stocks in a series of takeover 
bids for retailing companies. Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, the 
Landover, Md., company agreed in effect not to buy and sell securities as its 
primary business unless it registers as an investment company. The SEC accused 
Dart Group in a civil complaint in Washington federal court of violating 
securities laws by acting as an unregistered investment firm.

FRANCHISEE SUES SIZZLER, SEEKS $25 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A large franchisee in Chicago has sued Sizzler Restaurants International for 
$25 million, charging that the Los Angeles-based company defrauded the 
franchisee and tried to force it out of business in an attempt to take over the 
market at a low price. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Sizzler Restaurants International said the company is studying 
the suit but has a policy of refusing to comment on pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
FBN Food Services and Midwest Restaurant Concepts, sister companies that 
operate 21 of 24 Sizzler restaurants in Chicago, said Sizzler required FBN to 
agree to certain advertising expenditures when it bought its first eight 
Sizzlers in 1987. But Sizzler did not require the same of another Chicago 
franchisee, according to the lawsuit filed Feb. 21 in federal court in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Because the other franchisee failed to contribute to an advertising fund, 
business at all Chicago Sizzlers suffered, the suit contended. The other 
franchisee pressured FBN to buy its 12 restaurants, but Sizzler Restaurants 
International would not assist with financing or buy the restaurants itself, 
the suit stated. 
</P>
<P>
FBN's affiliate, Midwest Restaurant Concepts, was forced to buy the 12 
restaurants in May, 1989, to protect the investment of the two companies' 
common owners, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
Sizzler refused to help its franchisee in a variety of ways, the suit charged, 
"so that Sizzler could then acquire those restaurants by default or at a 
reduced price and so that Sizzler could otherwise gain control of the market 
for Sizzler restaurants in the Chicago metropolitan area." 
</P>
<P>
For example, the suit stated, Sizzler tried to hire away a key employee, 
arranged a meat supplier that sold poor-quality products and would not allow 
the franchisee to make "reasonable changes and modifications in products, menus 
and services in their restaurants" that other franchisees were able to make. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Basile, president of FBN and Midwest, said the restaurants have lost 
more than $3 million during the past two years. In addition to $15 million in 
actual damages, the suit seeks $10 million in punitive damages.

ICN WON'T SEEK OK FOR AIDS DRUG, POSTS BIG LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

ICN Pharmaceuticals said Wednesday that it has ceased efforts to obtain 
approval to market ribavirin in the United States as a remedy against the AIDS 
virus and took a $71-million writedown in the fourth quarter to reflect much of 
the impact of that decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa-based drug company reported a loss of $82 million for fiscal 
1989 ended Nov. 30, on sales of $185.5 million, compared to earnings of $17.8 
million on sales of $166.3 million in fiscal 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, the company posted a loss of $85.7 million on sales of 
$55.88 million, contrasted with earnings of $554,000 on sales of $49 million 
for the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The quarterly loss included a $56.6-million writeoff related to the company's 
74% ownership interest in Viratek Inc., its research subsidiary involved in 
development of ribavirin. The company also took additional one-time charges of 
$14.4 million related to Canadian tests of ribavirin, litigation and 
restructuring costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the complexity of the U.S. regulatory process and the time and 
considerable cost of doing additional trial work, it is difficult to predict 
when, if at all, an approved use of ribavirin against HIV (the AIDS virus) 
could be achieved in the United States," said ICN spokesman Jack Sholl in 
explaining the company's action. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the decision not to go forward with studies did not mean that the 
company has lost confidence in the drug's potential in thwarting AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Less than four years ago, there was widespread speculation that ribavirin -- 
marketed under the trade name Virazole -- had potential for fighting AIDS in 
its early stages. That belief fired up Wall Street, causing the price of ICN's 
stock in 1986 to soar to $34 a share from $10. It closed Wednesday at $4.75 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
ICN drew criticism from the Food and Drug Administration for making false 
claims about the drug, and in 1987 the company was scolded before a House 
subcommittee for providing allegedly misleading information to federal 
officials about ribavirin's effectiveness as an AIDS treatment.

S&amp;LS' SHARE OF HOME LOAN MARKET SHRINKS; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCING: MORTGAGE BANKING FIRMS AND BANKS ARE GETTING A LARGER PIECE OF THE 
RESALE MARKET IN CALIFORNIA, A SURVEY SHOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Savings and loans in California continued losing their share of the home 
lending market to banks and mortgage banking firms in 1989, a California Assn. 
of Realtors survey shows. 
</P>
<P>
The survey of about 1,000 association members released Wednesday showed that 
S&amp;Ls funded 41% of first mortgages on homes and condominiums the realtors 
sold, down from 47% a year ago and 59% in 1987. The association said mortgage 
banking firms increased their share to 44% from 41%, giving them the largest 
percentage of any industry group. Banks nearly doubled their share from 1987, 
to 11% from 6%. 
</P>
<P>
But industry executives cautioned not to make too much of the association's 
survey because it measured a narrow segment of the business. As a result, they 
said, it probably understates the role of banks in home lending and may 
overstate the role of mortgage banking firms, which sometimes take loans to 
banks to be funded. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the survey is in line with other studies nationally, providing further 
evidence that thrifts have lost their historical place as the nation's 
principal lenders of home loans. The reasons include increased competition from 
banks and mortgage bankers, combined with a severe industry shakeout that has 
forced even some of the healthiest thrifts to shrink to meet tough new capital 
standards that require a bigger cushion against losses. Hundreds of other 
thrifts nationwide have been taken over by regulators, sold or closed. 
</P>
<P>
The survey included only realtor members of the association, and the response 
rate was 10% to the 10,000 surveys sent out asking them to describe financing 
details of their recent sales. Because the respondents were realtors, nearly 
all the sales involved existing homes. 
</P>
<P>
That would understate bank activity in home lending because builders of new 
homes frequently use their own sales staff instead of realtors and often work 
directly with banks to help buyers finance purchases. The survey also does not 
include the refinancing of homes or home equity loans, two areas where 
California banks have been particularly aggressive lately. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan E. Gray, a savings and loan analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. 
in New York, said another factor that may distort the market share figures is 
that adjustable-rate mortgages, a specialty of savings and loans, were less 
attractive in 1989 than they were in 1988. ARMs are less appealing when 
interest rates are falling, as was the case during much of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the overall S&amp;L industry is losing its share, the trend does not 
necessarily mean that all thrifts are making fewer loans. It probably is more 
the result of the inactivity of troubled thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, other numbers compiled by the TRW/Comont market research firm show that 
Great Western in Beverly Hills in 1989 had the largest share, 7.5%, of loan 
originations of any institution in the state as measured by dollar volume. 
Following Great Western were two other healthy thrifts, Home Savings of America 
in Irwindale and World Savings in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Mortgage banking companies continue to play a bigger role in funding home loans 
in California. They specialize in making and selling real estate loans, often 
working closely with realtors and builders. Some of the largest firms in 
California are Imco Realty Services, Weyerhaeuser Mortgage, Countrywide Funding 
and Directors Mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Norman P. Anderson, senior vice president with Riverside-based Directors 
Mortgage, said 1989 was especially busy for mortgage bankers. He said that was 
in part because of falling interest rates, which caused many home buyers to 
seek fixed-rate loans from mortgage bankers. Many thrifts are increasingly 
shunning fixed-rate loans because they are unprofitable when interest rates 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
WHO MAKES HOME LOANS? 
</P>
<P>
Strict new federal rules are causing savings and loans' share of the mortgage 
market to shrink. Mortgage bankers and commercial banks seem to be the 
beneficiaries.

IMPERIAL S&amp;L'S PARENT FILES FOR CHAPTER 11; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE ACTION, WHICH WAS EXPECTED, WON'T AFFECT DEPOSITORS.

Imperial Corp. of America, the San Diego-based parent company of Imperial 
Savings Assn., has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court in San Diego, the company said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Savings, the nation's 16th-largest S&amp;L, was one of 12 troubled 
thrifts seized Friday by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial, which had $9.7 billion in assets Dec. 31, also reported $9.6 billion 
in liabilities and a negative net worth of $60.1 million, according to 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial was by far the largest business owned by ICA, which also owns a 
handful of relatively small insurance, investment and real estate operations. 
ICA reported a $136.2-million net loss for the nine-month period ended Sept. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing "will protect ICA's present assets, 
consolidate pending disputes and litigation in one court and give the company 
an opportunity to file a plan of reorganization," according to a press release 
issued Wednesday by ICA. 
</P>
<P>
ICA Chief Executive Lyman Hamilton said the filing would "protect our 
bondholders, shareholders and continue our operating businesses. . . . We 
believe this was a prudent thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L industry analysts earlier in the week predicted that ICA would be 
forced into bankruptcy court after the seizure of Imperial Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's filing contained no details about ICA's financial health. Filings 
during the next two weeks will describe the company's assets and liabilities, 
according to Patrick Shea, a San Diego-based attorney who is representing ICA 
in the bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's filing did not affect Imperial Savings, which is being operated on 
a day-to-day basis by the federal Resolution Trust Corp., which disposes of 
failed banks and thrifts.

'Cold' Laser Catheter: Trimedyne Inc. is "hedging its bets" on what form of 
laser technology will win the allegiance of physicians looking for a tool to 
unclog blocked arteries in the heart and limbs. 
</P>
<P>
The Tustin company, which already has approval from the Food and Drug 
Administration to market a thermal-type laser-assisted catheter, is also 
conducting tests on two varieties of so-called "cold" laser catheters, which 
use laser beams to remove plaque without creating much heat. On Wednesday, the 
company said it had received FDA approval to begin human clinical trials of a 
cold laser to open partially blocked blood vessels. Several weeks ago, it 
received similar approval to begin testing a cold laser on fully blocked 
vessels.

AUSTRALIA'S QINTEX TO SELL 232 ACRES IN DANA POINT PLANNED FOR A RESORT; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: DEVELOPERS ARE SAID TO BE INTERESTED IN THE MONARCH BEACH 
PROPERTY, BOUGHT FOR $131 MILLION, AND IN THE HEADLANDS, ANOTHER OCEANFRONT 
PARCEL. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After insisting for months that it intended to build a plush resort in the 
Orange County beach town of Dana Point, an Australian company said Wednesday it 
will instead sell its 232 prime acres overlooking the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex's lenders have been trying to unload its Australian television stations 
and resorts to recover more than $1 billion in loans. 
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts suggest the Dana Point land is so loaded with debt that the 
company won't realize much -- if any -- profit from the sale. So selling it has 
been a low priority. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the land still isn't officially on the market, said Kevin Wallace, a 
Qintex executive in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Other developers, including some Japanese interests, are said by brokers to be 
very interested in the Quintex property and a second oceanfront parcel in Dana 
Point that Qintex once had an option to buy. 
</P>
<P>
But some experts say the market is weaker than it was last year, when Qintex 
bought the property. 
</P>
<P>
Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
* Competition gets tougher as hotels proliferate along the Orange County coast, 
a trend fueled by the proximity of millions of customers in the Los Angeles 
metro area and a glut of resorts in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
* Dana Point, which incorporated only last year, will likely be tougher on 
development than county government. 
</P>
<P>
* It's harder to borrow money given the turmoil in the lending industry and the 
junk bond market, so there aren't as many buyers bidding up land prices. 
</P>
<P>
* A developer might have to own both parcels to make the most money from them, 
since only one has access to a golf course, a necessity for a resort. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the parcels are among only a handful of prime oceanfront 
sites left so close to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex raised eyebrows when it bought the 232 acres at Monarch Beach for $131 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts suggest Qintex borrowed at least that much. With accrued 
interest the company may need to get as much as $150 million to break even on 
land that sold for only $32 million two years earlier. Monarch Beach has a golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
The sellers, local developers Stein-Brief Group and Hawaiian mega-developer 
Christopher B. Hemmeter, had government approval to build a huge hotel 
patterned after Hearst Castle at San Simeon. Qintex contemplated a smaller, 
plusher hotel along the lines of the nearby Ritz-Carlton, an exclusive, luxury 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Qintex took an option to buy the other, 115-acre parcel in Dana 
Point called the Headlands for a stiff $120 million. It planned to build homes 
and perhaps another hotel there, which would have had access to the 
Qintex-owned golf course just up the coast at Monarch Beach. (There's no room 
to build a course on the Headlands.) 
</P>
<P>
But Qintex couldn't make the payments and the option lapsed after Qintex spent 
$12 million. In fact, Qintex was beginning to unravel late last year when its 
bankers wouldn't lend it the money for its biggest deal, the purchase of the 
MGM/UA film studios. Qintex went into receivership shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Headlands' owner, the Chandler family, said earlier that 
the family took the property off the market while it completes a market study. 
</P>
<P>
Among the suitors for the Headlands are Stein-Brief, now flush with cash from 
selling the Monarch Beach property to Qintex for a spectacular profit. 
Stein-Brief is "interested," said principal David Stein, though "not pursuing 
it aggressively." 
</P>
<P>
And Dana Point City Manager William O. Talley said executives of a Japanese 
company recently visited City Hall to ask about the zoning on the property. 
</P>
<P>
The city of 28,000 is watching both parcels anxiously, since it has few 
industries other than tourism and hotels mean tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
But the Headlands is also the city's most prominent geographical feature and 
developing it is likely to stir a fairly strong slow-growth sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Monarch Beach, the Headlands has no government approvals to build. 
Getting them could mean a yearslong, costly fight -- possibly against stiff 
opposition -- at City Hall and the Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex is one of several high-flying Australian companies shot down by heavy 
debt, ambitious expansions and high interest rates in Australia that are being 
broken up and sold. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a buyer's market now," said Edward Falkiner of the Australian stock 
brokerage Ord Minnett. 
</P>
<P>
"There are cheap television stations, cheap breweries, cheap shopping centers." 
</P>
<P>
QINTEX IN DANA POINT 
</P>
<P>
Qintex is planning to sell 232 acres in the Monarch Beach area of Dana Point, 
where the company had planned to build a resort hotel. Qintex also held an 
option to purchase the nearby Headlands, but the option lapsed late last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
Trying to be different in the world of country music is like trying to be 
different in the average schoolyard: As the price of individuality, you might 
have to take some lumps. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Gaffney, a singer and bandleader from Costa Mesa, likes to add his own 
twists of style and imagination to the usual country sound -- which makes him 
suspect in the eyes of Nashville Establishment types looking for music that 
conforms to familiar, ready-to-market patterns. In fact, Gaffney has a memo of 
rejection from Nashville to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
The memo came last month from a talent scout for one of the major country 
labels, who listened to Gaffney's new album at the behest of some of the 
singer's West Coast boosters in the music business. 
</P>
<P>
"He needs to get together with some writers that have more commercial writing 
experience," the scout opined in a note that Gaffney, who maintains a wry sense 
of humor about himself, decided to keep for his personal archives. 
</P>
<P>
"Please remember that in country music we depend ENTIRELY on country radio to 
sell our product. If the music isn't commercial enough to be played on radio, 
it doesn't do anybody any good." 
</P>
<P>
The memo says a lot about the shriveled artistic ambitions and the smug, 
play-it-safe attitude that dog the music industry. It says nothing about the 
quality of Gaffney's excellent album. 
</P>
<P>
Issued in January by ROM Records, a small Los Angeles label, "Chris Gaffney 
&amp; the Cold Hard Facts" is a vibrant album full of catchy, eminently 
hummable songs. Gaffney's music burrows into honky-tonk traditions, then veers 
into such stylistic byways as Louisiana zydeco and Mexican folk music, both of 
which afford a forum for the singer's sprightly accordion playing. All of this 
comes across with an uncommon zest of performance and freshness of lyrical 
style. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between Gaffney's songs and the output of the more "commercial" 
songwriters laboring in Nashville's hit factories is that nearly everything the 
so-called professionals produce is a variation on something we've already heard 
before. Gaffney's music is full of detailed, personal observations and offbeat, 
challenging phrasings that can take a few hearings to sink in fully. Listening 
to it must have been a bewildering experience for a memo-writing music mogul 
focusing narrowly on the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
Gaffney and his longtime musical partner, keyboards player Wyman Reese, sounded 
undaunted by the kiss-off missive from Nashville during a recent interview at 
Gaffney's house in a quiet Costa Mesa subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
"It just thickens your skin a bit," said Gaffney, 39, who has worked in a 
Newport Beach boatyard by day for the last nine years while trying to gain a 
foothold by night as a honky-tonk contender. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what we do is fairly right-down-the-pipe country, but if you (mess) 
around with the lyrics any, they think you're a smartass. Maybe we just have to 
hammer them over the head with it for a couple years. We're getting more 
acceptance (since the album's release). Now that things have started poppin' a 
bit, everything is possible." 
</P>
<P>
Gaffney is a wiry man with tousled hair, a goatee and sharply angled eyebrows 
that give his face an ironic cast. As he speaks in a laconic, drawling voice, 
the penchant for wordplay evident in his song lyrics spills into his 
conversation. Like the boxers he loves to watch on TV, he is always looking for 
an opening for a wry verbal jab. 
</P>
<P>
His best verbal sallies come out in such songs as "Glass House," a sad 
honky-tonk ballad that is an open tribute to George Jones. Gaffney -- a 
flexible singer whose voice can sometimes bear a resemblance to Levon Helm of 
the Band -- assumes the distinctive high nasal twang and heartbroken 
plaintiveness of Jones' style as he tells the story of a relationship on the 
rocks. 
</P>
<P>
"Now my life barely imitates art," muses the song's bereft protagonist, in one 
of those wonderful, double-take lines that spins off all sorts of meanings. 
</P>
<P>
On one level, the verse is a nice inside joke for country aficionados: After 
all, the entire song is an open imitation of the art of George Jones, whom 
Gaffney lists as a key influence, alongside Bob Wills and Ray Price. 
</P>
<P>
On another level, it raises interesting questions about the relationship 
between country music and its audience. So much country music is art imitating 
life, with songs focusing on what goes on in barrooms, bedrooms, truck stops 
and other down-to-earth, everyday situations. Yet many listeners, in a case of 
life imitating art, will measure their own experience against the stories and 
emotions they glean from a favorite song. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Gaffney conceded, a line about life barely imitating art isn't 
what you'd expect to find in a typically transparent country lyric. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if George (Jones) would ever sing something that cerebral," 
Gaffney said. "He might look at 'life barely imitates art' and say, 'What the 
hell is this?' " 
</P>
<P>
Not that Gaffney can't tell a straightforward story when he wants to. "The 
Gardens" is an effective evocation of a Latino neighborhood living in fear of 
drive-by gang shootings (Gaffney said the song is taken straight from a slice 
of violent street life he witnessed while living in Hawaiian Gardens). Such 
familiar country characters as divorced daddies, jilted lovers and furtive 
adulterers also weave their way through the album, brought to life by Gaffney's 
gift for the telling, offbeat detail. 
</P>
<P>
Gaffney's wife, Julie, has one complaint: "He won't write a song about me. I've 
asked him, I've begged him. I've gotten down on my knees." 
</P>
<P>
But if Gaffney finds no songwriting inspiration from his marriage, that may be 
for the best. His songs tend to spring from life's trials and embarrassments 
(albeit with an eye toward the humor in those situations), rather than from its 
moments of bliss. 
</P>
<P>
"I just never write songs like that," Gaffney said of his wife's request for a 
commemorative song of love and devotion. "Am I that gruesome? I'm not really a 
professor of doom." 
</P>
<P>
Gaffney was born in Vienna, where his father, a career Army pilot, was 
stationed. He did most of his growing up in Arizona and Orange County, 
graduating from Western High School in Anaheim, where he split time between 
playing in rock bands and devoting himself to track, football and Golden Gloves 
boxing. 
</P>
<P>
During his early 20s, he got involved with country musicians during a stay in 
Canada and began playing music in the tradition of Wills, Price and Jones. By 
25, he was writing songs of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from a brief flirtation with the idea of becoming a high school history 
teacher, Gaffney said: "I never thought of anything other than making it in 
music. Every other job I've had has been a means to get by" while devoting 
himself to writing songs and playing in bands. 
</P>
<P>
Gaffney said his first serious band was the Phantom Herd, which he and Reese 
formed after they met in 1977. That band fizzled after a time of popularity on 
the club circuit in Newport Beach; Gaffney and Reese resurfaced with the Cold 
Hard Facts in 1984. The band -- which also includes Gaffney's brother, Chris, 
on bass, drummer Tucker Fleming and guitarists Danny Ott and Rick Shea -- has 
had little presence in Orange County, playing mainly in Los Angeles clubs like 
the Palomino and the Music Machine. 
</P>
<P>
Gaffney &amp; the Cold Hard Facts began reaching out to the wider world in 1987 
with "Road to Indio," a mini-album on their own custom label, Cactus Club 
Records. "Chris Gaffney &amp; the Cold Hard Facts" gives them a fine calling 
card for major label attention, no matter what Gaffney's memo from Nashville 
may say. In what figures to be the band's most important show to date, it will 
travel to Austin, Tex., to play March 17 at the South By Southwest Conference, 
a music-business gathering where bands can bid for the attention of 
journalists, radio programmers and record companies. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just hoping to get somebody bigger interested," Reese said. "It's the 
next step. Radio doesn't seem to know it, but people are ready to accept 
anything if it's good." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Gaffney &amp; the Cold Hard Facts and Jim Lauderdale play Friday at 10 
p.m. at the Breakaway, 11970 Venice Blvd., Los Angeles. Admission: $5. 
Information: (213) 397-5078.

' 'NIGHT, MOTHER' DERIVES ITS POWER FROM OBJECTIVITY ABOUT SUICIDE; 
</P>
<P>
DRAMA: IS A DAUGHTER'S DECISION TO KILL HERSELF A SELFISH ACT OR THE BEST 
OPTION TO PRESERVE DIGNITY? A GARDEN GROVE PLAY LOOKS INTO THE VICTIM'S HEART.

<TEXT>
<P>
Marsha Norman's " 'night, Mother" raises two opposed dynamics: Is Jessie's 
decision to kill herself an act of existential dignity or the worst retreat, a 
selfish step that ignores the consequences left behind? 
</P>
<P>
It's a credit to directors Michelle and Tim Bagley that their Garden Grove 
Community Theatre production does not fudge on either of these questions. This 
is a clear, steadily acted treatment of Norman's 1983 Pulitzer Prize-winning 
drama. 
</P>
<P>
In Jessie (Nancy Smeets), we find a young woman exhausted by her days; she 
moves wearily around the tidy home (Walter Brown's set is suitably 
unpretentious and suburban) she shares with her mother, Thelma. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a troubled life -- Jessie's an epileptic with a bad marriage and a 
wayward son -- and in her mind, the time is right to end the disappointment and 
pain. Smeets is methodical, restrained, direct. 
</P>
<P>
Thelma (Sheri Savage) is disbelieving when Jessie announces her plans, but she 
soon realizes her daughter's seriousness. She pleads, demands, threatens, 
cajoles, trying to get her to go on, but she knows that Jessie is "already 
gone." Savage is emotional, confused, guilty. 
</P>
<P>
The ending, as it usually does, stuns, even though we know it's inexorable. 
Jessie locks herself in the bedroom while Thelma convulses outside. The gun 
goes off. Now it's time for Thelma to call her son, and then the authorities. 
Jessie's decision lives beyond her as the family, especially Thelma, will deal 
with it: What could they have done to prevent it? What signs did they miss? 
</P>
<P>
Norman doesn't take a position one way or the other. Both sides have strong 
voices: We hear Thelma tell her daughter of the options, and Jessie agrees but 
adds that death is one option she knows will work. Thelma argues that her love 
for Jessie makes it impossible to accept her choice. Jessie says love is what 
should allow her to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
Much of " 'night, Mother's" validity is rooted to its steadfast, objectifying 
distance. We understand that suicide is a waste, but until we understand the 
heart of the victim, it's impossible for us to judge. 
</P>
<P>

BUDAPEST TRIO PLAYS BEFORE SMALL AUDIENCE AT CHAPMAN COLLEGE HALL 
</P>

<P>
The Budapest Trio made its Orange County debut Tuesday night in the austerity 
of Salmon Recital Hall at Chapman College. Perhaps 100 -- many of them students 
required to submit reports -- attended. They turned out to be a very privileged 
hundred. 
</P>
<P>
With Haydn, Schubert and Beethoven as mainstays, the Budapest Trio did not 
hazard a daring program. Even Dohnanyi's Serenade, Opus 10, represented Hungary 
conservatively. Still, the trio -- violinist Ferenc Kiss, violist Tivadar Popa 
and German cellist Peter Wopke (the only one not from Hungary) -- proved itself 
an ensemble capable of stunning interpretive unity and control. 
</P>
<P>
Most notable was a chameleon-like ability to alter tone color to suit the work. 
In the opening movements of two B-flat trios, Haydn's Opus 53, No. 1 and 
Schubert's D. 581 -- the former marked Allegretto ed innocente, the latter 
implicitly demanding a cantabile approach -- the group adopted a warm, inviting 
quality. But Beethoven's intense C-minor trio, Opus 9, No. 3, and the March 
from Dohnanyi's Serenade evoked a biting edge. 
</P>
<P>
Exquisite control extended to the dynamic palette as well. In the Haydn trio, 
identical in all but its key with the G-major Piano Sonata written in 1784, the 
Budapest concentrated on fine nuance within the lower ranges of the dynamic 
spectrum. As a result, the first movement in particular emerged with a greater 
intimacy than the lighter piano version conveys. 
</P>
<P>
Though holding rapt attention to detail, the ensemble illuminated mature 
understanding of overall structure. In the Allegro con spirito of the Beethoven 
trio, admirable control of accent and direction, and fine mirroring of motives 
as they passed from one player to another, imparted unity to the movement. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the trio maintained momentum through the potential pitfalls of 
Schubert's quiet, quirky Andante (omitted from the printed program), a movement 
full of stops and starts that threaten cohesiveness. 
</P>
<P>
The Budapest Trio is an ensemble of musicians, not showmen. Technical demands 
of speed and precision did not faze them; the perpetual motion of Dohnanyi's 
Scherzo raced by, light, clear and focused. But they avoided acrobatics as a 
means to impress -- choosing, for instance, a very conservative Presto in the 
Finale of the Beethoven trio, a tempo that permitted unswerving faithfulness to 
musical subtleties.

19-FOOT 'INVENTIONS' SCULPTURE UNVEILED IN FOUNTAIN VALLEY

San Pedro artist Michael Davis says he thought a lot about patients' peace of 
mind when he designed the permanent sculpture unveiled here Wednesday at the 
corporate headquarters and medical complex of FHP Health Care Inc., a 
health-maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioned to create "Inventions and Discoveries" for FHP after winning a 
sculpture competition last year, Davis fashioned steel, bronze, copper and gold 
leaf into a 19-foot metal, conical tower. 
</P>
<P>
Placed at the entrance to a hospital, it supports familiar items related to 
science: a sun dial, a double helix, planetlike orbs and a golden, sunlike 
globe among them. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to present a piece of sculpture that would make patients feel 
somewhat at home with science, at home with the kind of mystery that happens 
behind the doors (of the hospital)," Davis said before the unveiling ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a great deal of anxiety when I go to see doctors. Anything that would 
ease that anxiety for me is beneficial." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, whose other permanent public artworks include a piece embedded in the 
facade of the Laguna Art Museum, was among 65 artists in the FHP competition, 
open to any artist who lived or worked in Orange County from 1968 to 1988. He 
received $35,000 for the commission. ZAN DUBIN

BARNEYS OPENS UPSCALE DOORS IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
What do Kathleen Turner, Mick Jagger and Jill Brotherton have in common? They 
all shop at Barneys New York, the trend-setting clothier and undisputed fashion 
mecca of the Big Apple's upper crust and upwardly mobile. 
</P>
<P>
Brotherton, a Dana Point resident, joined the ranks of the chic and well-heeled 
last weekend when Barneys opened the doors of its new store in South Coast 
Plaza, its first in California. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't this one fun!" she grinned, holding up the Mondrian-patterned rayon 
shirt by Camicia of Italy that she was buying for her husband's birthday. "I 
already have a present for him, but I fell in love with this." 
</P>
<P>
Within half an hour of opening, the store was crammed with eager shoppers, many 
of whom were already familiar with Barneys' reputation for being on fashion's 
cutting edge. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been waiting for this shop to open for about a year," said Lois 
McCauley, who drove down from Long Beach for the opening. "Barneys is one of my 
favorite shops in New York. I visit it every time I go there. It's so with the 
times." 
</P>
<P>
The 7,500-square-foot store is on the second level in the Nordstrom wing. It is 
the latest addition in Henry Segerstrom's grand plan to upgrade the caliber of 
his tenant mix in South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Barneys New York joins a growing roster of prestigious names that have been 
lured to South Coast Plaza in recent years. Segerstrom's A-list of tenants now 
includes such retailing glitterati as Tiffany &amp; Co., Alfred Dunhill, 
Cartier, Gucci, Luis Vuitton, Charles Jourdan, Yves Saint Laurent and, in the 
fall, Chanel. 
</P>
<P>
The store with the name more redolent of an Irish pub than an upscale clothier 
is named after its founder, Barney Pressman, who opened a 500-square-foot men's 
clothing store in Manhattan in 1923. Forty years later, Barneys had become the 
largest men's clothing store in the world. 
</P>
<P>
In 1968 the Pressman family transformed Barneys into a fashion leader by making 
it the first men's store in America to feature European designers. In 1976, a 
women's department was added. Today the Pressman family runs a 
170,000-square-foot fashion and accessory emporium in Manhattan's Chelsea 
district that generates more than $100 million in sales each year. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Barneys grandsons, Gene and Robert Pressman, head the new Barneys 
America retail company which plans to open five or six Barneys New York stores 
annually over the next five years, a move which, they project, will double the 
company's sales volume. Two weeks ago, they opened their first West Coast store 
in Seattle. A 100,000-square-foot Beverly Hills Barneys is scheduled to open in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We identified Orange County as one of the fastest-growing retail markets in 
America," said Michael Hofman, the company's vice president and director of 
stores. "We knew we wanted to be in South Coast Plaza. We were just waiting for 
the right space to open up." 
</P>
<P>
On March 17, Barneys will officially welcome itself to Orange County by 
presenting a jean jacket auction and exhibition to benefit the Newport Harbor 
Art Museum. Renowned designers and artists, among them Billy Al Bengston, will 
customize the jackets, which will be on display at the museum before the event. 
</P>
<P>
Although the new store is only a fraction of the size of the New York flagship, 
the unmistakable Barneys touch is intact. Blrims in the hat department sport 
fanciful crinkles, and the signature shoe collection features such designers as 
Stephane Kelian of Paris whose cinnamon suede pump sports an unlikely flourish 
of fruit, shells, coral and an enormous silk organdy bow. 
</P>
<P>
Jewelry cases display one-of-a-kind designs by artists including New York-based 
Lisa Jenks, who created a singular collection of picture frames, powder 
compacts and paperweights in pewter to complement her earrings and necklaces. 
And at the cosmetics counter, customers will find such esoterica as Molton 
Brown's seaweed anti-static setting lotion alongside the more prosaic lipsticks 
and scented candles. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think that fashion is such a deadly serious pursuit," said Anne Ball, 
Barneys merchandise manager. "We like that air of lightness." 
</P>
<P>
Because much of the store's pre-opening publicity was peppered with words like 
expensive, snobbish and exclusive, it would have been easy to mistake Barneys 
for yet another purveyor of overpriced Ralph Lauren clone-wear for the yuppie 
set, yet nothing could be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
The store showcases some of the world's most avant-garde designers. It was 
Barneys, after all, that introduced designer Giorgio Armani into America back 
in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"Barneys is truly a risk-taking store," agreed Maura Eggan, South Coast Plaza's 
director of marketing, who was on hand for the store's opening. "Because they 
nurture new designers, they always carry wonderful, innovative clothes." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Barneys' usual roster of top designers including Comme De 
Garcons, Jean Paul Gaultier and Byblos, the South Coast Plaza store will also 
feature prominent West Coast designers. Peter Cohen of Los Angeles has designed 
an exclusive line for the new Barneys. 
</P>
<P>
And in a quiet alcove at the back of the store, Barneys is showcasing a 
collection of its own private label clothes, many of which are designed and 
tailored in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
In a break from its New York retail outlet, 75% of the merchandise in the Costa 
Mesa store is targeted toward women because they make up 75% of South Coast 
Plaza's customers. And in a nod to Southern California's less formal life 
style, both the men's and women's apparel lines tend more toward casual styling 
and sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
Back East, where designer outfits at Barneys are often priced over $1,000, the 
store is touted as the most expensive in New York. But for South Coast Plaza 
regulars, a $150 silk blouse or $200 Italian pump is par for the shopping 
course. For all the hoopla about high New York prices, Orange County shoppers 
will find Barneys prices moderate. A range of 100% cotton men's T-shirts in hot 
spice colors with tailor-finished necklines and sleeves sell for $28. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Brotherton, who paid $58 for her husband's imported designer shirt, was 
now admiring a whimsical wine-colored blouse by London designer Sara Sturgeon. 
Made of washed silk habitai (silk moleskin to you and me) it featured an 
asymmetrical shawl collar. She found the $106 price reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
"It's worth it for the quality alone, but toss in the uniqueness factor and 
it's a bargain," she said. "I'm so tired of the repetitiousness of the stores 
here. Who wouldn't be willing to pay a little extra to get something you don't 
see on everyone on every corner?" 
</P>
<P>
If Saturday was any indication, South Coast Plaza shoppers are ready for 
something a little different. As Michael Hofman watched them press two and 
three deep around the cashier's desk, he admitted that sales were well ahead of 
projections after only two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone who came to Saturday's opening was there to shop. "May I help 
you?" a young saleswoman asked one couple dressed to the teeth in Orange County

ANN CONWAY: SINGER TAKES AUDIENCE 'BACKSTAGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY

<TEXT>
<P>
She could have dished the dirt. But she didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of trumpeting the ugly details of the rocky marriage she shared with 
Robert Goulet, singer-actress Carol Lawrence gave her audience one from the 
heart last week at a monthly meeting of Round Table West at the Balboa Bay 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
"My father was an abused child, incapable of saying 'I love you,' " said 
Lawrence, author of the new book, "Carol Lawrence: The Backstage Story." "I 
kept searching for someone like my dad. The wrong man. Bobby (Goulet) was 
vulnerable, an unloved child who emulated his idol Richard Burton, who suffered 
from alcoholism." 
</P>
<P>
The couple lived a goldfish existence, Lawrence said. Entourages surrounded 
them. The press painted them in words that made the world think they would 
always be the bride and groom atop the wedding cake. "But I kept falling into 
the frosting," Lawrence said, her huge brown eyes clouding. "I didn't know how 
to handle someone addicted. They are addicted to a substance. And people like 
me are addicted to loving them into wellness." 
</P>
<P>
But the only person you can heal is yourself, Lawrence learned. And writing her 
new book is the final step in Lawrence's campaign to heal herself. "I started 
going to Al Anon meetings and found out about its 12-step program. The final 
step is to reach out and help others. So here I am. We all need to let down the 
facade. We're so afraid to let people see us." 
</P>
<P>
During the luncheon, which also featured Roddy McDowall talking about his new 
book, "Double Exposure, Take Two," and cartoonist Chuck Jones, author of "Chuck 
Amuck: The Life and Times of an Animated Cartoonist," Lawrence whispered that 
she had "gone it alone" after her split with Goulet. "I was isolated while 
trying to cope. You didn't have anybody's permission to be anything less than 
perfect in those days. There were no books on co-dependency to learn from. 
We're not meant to go through such things alone." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence's dream is to use proceeds from her autobiography to create a "women's 
center where we can come together to empower and encourage each other to 
discover and become all we are capable of," she says in her book. "To learn to 
meet our needs -- mental, spiritual and physical and to share our problems, 
joys and solutions." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence said she had heard about Goulet's Feb. 20 appearance on "Entertainment 
Tonight" where he had discussed her book, saying it contained inaccuracies. 
(And where, according to a press release provided by the television show, 
Goulet said: "Supposedly I had a drinking problem at that time. I was never 
falling down drunk, but I drank too much. You wonder, what caused the drinking? 
Was it because of my unhappiness? Or were we unhappy because of the drinking? 
But within a year after I left Carol, I stopped drinking completely.") 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he could have read the book and said that," Lawrence said. "If 
he would read it, he would know it was written in love." 
</P>
<P>
Happy Campers: "Private Party." That was the sign that warned hotel guests to 
stay away from the reception preceding the Junior Wheelchair Sports Camp 
benefit at the Ritz-Carlton hotel last week. Luncheons don't get any classier 
than the one staged by Neiman Marcus and Chariot Champions, the fund-raising 
support group for the camp held each spring at Saddleback College. After 
chatting on a tile patio trimmed with a rainbow of primroses, guests gathered 
in the ballroom to enjoy hearts of bibb lettuce with papaya and grapefruit, 
broiled orange roughy and chocolate torte. The tab? "Fifty dollars per person," 
said event chairwoman Betty Belden Palmer. "It costs a little more at the Ritz, 
but it's worth it. Everything is perfect!" 
</P>
<P>
During the festivities, Chariot Champions president Barbara De Mott welcomed 
guests and introduced Marion Knott Montapert, honorary chairwoman (Montapert 
bought two tables at $1,250 each.) Montapert announced the 1989 "Campers of the 
Year," Tony Lara and Rene Erickson, and then Neiman Marcus wowed the crowd with 
a fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds of about $30,000 will go toward support of the camp, a two-day fest 
for children ages 6 to 18 who must use wheelchairs to participate in sports. 
The camp is the brainchild of Brad Parks of San Clemente, president/founder of 
the National Foundation of Wheelchair Tennis. Parks, a paraplegic, injured his 
back in a skiing accident during the '70s. Just two weeks ago, Parks and his 
wife, Wendy, became the proud parents of twin girls. "Sarah and Maiah," cooed 
their grandmum, Larrie Parks. "We're thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
Luncheon committee members included Carol Blanchard, Nora Jorgensen, Suzanne 
Newby, Patricia Yoder, Sally Welsh, Patricia Houston, Rita Gunkel and Hope Von 
Herzen. 
</P>

Cypress College Dinner: They saluted the executive vice president of Disneyland 
but there was nothing Mickey Mouse about the 1990 Americana Awards Dinner on 
Saturday night. The nod to Ron Dominguez at the Disneyland Hotel attracted 
$20,000 in cash donations and 700 guests who paid $125 each. Proceeds will go 
toward college scholarships and tutorial services. Don Karcher was chairman.

TOY THEME ADDS A PLAYFUL NOTE TO BALL FOR BOAT PARADE ORGANIZERS

At the check-in desk: foot-high mirrored pedestals spilling plastic dinosaurs 
and roach-size racing cars and G.I. Joes. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the ballroom: stuffed animals and model planes and building blocks and 
games, piled into a little red wagon on stage and heaped on top of giant 
gift-wrapped boxes near the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
A symphony of toys, appropriately enough. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, one corner of the Anaheim Hilton was decked out as a festive 
playroom for the 400 guests of the Huntington Harbour Philharmonic Committee's 
Grand Marshal Ball. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner party was a thank-you for organizers of last December's boat parade 
and Cruise of Lights fund-raiser. The parade and cruise, under the theme 
"Symphony of Toys," raised more than $100,000 for the Orange County 
Philharmonic Society's youth music programs. 
</P>
<P>
Missy and Court Prowell were all-stars of the ball. Missy is the committee's 
chairwoman and Court was last year's grand marshal. 
</P>
<P>
How did they split their duties? "Easy," said Court, who led the parading 
harborites in a friend's 84-foot cruiser. "Missy did all the work." 
</P>
<P>
Sharing the ball's spotlight was Leon Statler, who was named grand marshal for 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
In the cocktail-hour crowd were Don Hartfelder, Ken Dickson and Otto Strehlow. 
Hartfelder, who was grand marshal in 1978, joked that although it was a lot of 
work, "I did anything and everything to get my boat up to the front of the 
line." 
</P>
<P>
Vern and Betty Mays sipped drinks with John and Marky Paugh, Jim Mitchell and 
Meryle Hammatt. Both the Mayses and the Paughs have participated in the parade 
for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
"So we're old hands," said Vern Mays. 
</P>
<P>
"Young old hands," added his wife. 
</P>
<P>
In line for souvenir photographs were young hands Dianne and Anton Flecklin and 
Mary and Dwayne Lund -- two of the couples who rode the "newcomers' boat" in 
the parade. 
</P>
<P>
Younger hands Christine Bremer and Tracy Hardigree, juniors at Huntington Beach 
High School, greeted guests and clowned with a mime circulating through the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The ball was chaired by Isabel Greenwald, with help from Marian Galanis, Eva 
Holmes, Arden Duckworth, Dorothy Johnson, Yvonne Kelley, Dorothy Silverman and 
Phyllis Helland. 
</P>
<P>
After cocktails, guests enjoyed a dinner of lobster-and-crab-meat ravioli, 
grilled filet mignon and poached salmon, washed down with Korbel Brut champagne 
and Bollo Chardonnay and Bardolino.

WHAT'S IN L.A.'S NAME? $4 MILLION IN REVENUE, COUNTY OFFICIALS FIGURE

Sun lovers could soon purchase swimsuits or tanning lotion bearing the official 
seal of approval of Los Angeles County lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
Gun fanciers could line up to buy weapons or bulletproof vests endorsed by 
Sheriff Sherman Block and his deputies. 
</P>
<P>
County officials envision earning as much as $4 million a year from firms using 
the Los Angeles County name in the advertising of products. 
</P>
<P>
"If Coke wants to be the official drink of county lifeguards, that's going to 
be worth some dollars to us," maintained Chris Klinger, deputy director of 
county beaches and harbors. 
</P>
<P>
The county has been raising about $1 million a year by allowing advertising on 
the beaches. But it is now seeking passage of legislation by Sen. Robert 
Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) to spell out its authority to endorse products. On 
Wednesday, the proposal cleared its first hurdle when the Senate Local 
Government Committee approved the legislation in a 6-2 vote and sent it to the 
Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of creating centers of profit could extend to any county 
government department with commercial appeal, and to every county in the state. 
Orange and San Diego counties, for example, could also profit from 
beach-related endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
"Every county has some unique feature" that could lend itself to such a 
licensing arrangement, Beverly said. The bill's supporters also anticipate that 
the marketing efforts will capitalize on the worldwide appeal of Los Angeles, 
especially its bronzed lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County prohibits endorsements for tobacco and alcohol products. But 
the proposal would not block wine-growing counties from promoting their own 
line of burgundy or chablis. 
</P>
<P>
And Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose), a member of the Local Government 
Committee, suggested that brewers could also enter agreements for county-owned 
stadiums to plug their beer. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County is not the only government to establish a marketing venture. 
Montgomery County, Md., last November began to sell its own line of distilled 
spirits. And last spring, Beverly Hills High School announced that it would 
sell a line of clothes. Hali Wickner, a spokeswoman for Beverly Hills schools, 
said Wednesday that the marketing program, after meeting mixed results, has 
been on hold for the last two months. She said the school district is awaiting 
a new proposal from another firm. 
</P>
<P>
With local governments strapped for cash, Los Angeles County has championed 
different ways to join with private enterprise to make money. In the last few 
years, the county allowed bright yellow trash cans advertising suntan lotion on 
beaches. Later, it approved signs that said "Nissan, official car of the Los 
Angeles County beaches." And last summer, supervisors approved advertising on 
beachside phone booths. 
</P>
<P>
Klinger said these programs are designed to offset the estimated 
$11-million-a-year operating deficit of his Los Angeles County beaches and 
harbors department. "There are 70 million users on the beach each year and if 
we can get a sponsor who is interested in cultivating them . . . I don't have a 
problem with that," Klinger said. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters said that eventually the county may create a county symbol to be 
sold along with its endorsement.

BARRIER TO MALIBU CITYHOOD VOTE LIFTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a victory for Malibu cityhood supporters, a judge on Wednesday knocked down 
a legal barrier erected last week by Los Angeles County supervisors and ordered 
county officials to set a June incorporation election. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of Malibu residents who want to see their seaside community 
become a city, Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs lifted a stay put in place 
when the supervisors filed a court appeal last week. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the county immediately questioned whether Janavs had the authority 
to take the action, which, left unchallenged, clears the way for a Malibu 
election to be held June 12. County officials indicated that they would seek to 
have the stay reimposed by a state appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ordered the supervisors -- who are to meet today -- to "fully and 
promptly" comply with an earlier order she issued last month, which had given 
them until Tuesday to stop stalling and set the election. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, county officials disclosed that they had appealed the order, 
resulting in an automatic stay and making it likely that the state Court of 
Appeal would have to decide whether the long-sought election is to be delayed 
further. 
</P>
<P>
However, Janavs cited the "important right" of Malibu residents to vote on 
cityhood in invoking her authority under state law to lift the stay, thereby 
placing the burden on the county to persuade the appellate court to act if the 
election is to be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of supervisors have resisted Malibu incorporation for years, 
insisting that an extensive sewer system be approved before a cityhood election 
takes place. 
</P>
<P>
Although the supervisors began an incorporation hearing last Oct. 19, they 
voted 4 to 1 in November to indefinitely postpone a decision on the matter -- 
thus postponing the hearing's conclusion -- until construction permits for the 
sewer system are issued. The hearing, required by state law so that both sides 
can express their views, is the last step before an election can be set. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood backers, many of whom regard the county's sewer plans as a prelude to 
widespread development of the Malibu coast, filed a lawsuit against the 
supervisors in December. They accused the county officials of violating a state 
law that sets a 60-day limit on the duration of a hearing before an election 
date is set. 
</P>
<P>
In siding with cityhood proponents in January, Janavs rejected the county's 
argument that state law sets guidelines recommending -- but not necessarily 
mandating -- the 60-day limit on concluding the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, jubilant cityhood backers expressed confidence that the judge's 
decision will clear the way for a June election. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful, just wonderful," said Carolyn Van Horn, co-chairwoman of the 
Malibu Committee for Incorporation. "The supervisors have denied us our 
constitutional right to vote for too long, and it's gratifying when a judge 
recognizes that." 
</P>
<P>
For an election to be held in June, the supervisors would have to conclude the 
hearing and set the election date by March 9. 
</P>
<P>
Graham Ritchie, an attorney for the incorporation group, said that unless the 
supervisors act promptly, he will seek a contempt citation against them. 
</P>
<P>
"Absent any other orders from any other court, if they don't act promptly we 
will seek a writ holding the board in contempt and ask that they be jailed 
until they comply," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the judge's action means the supervisors will likely now set the 
election, Assistant County Counsel Bill Pellman was noncommittal. 
</P>
<P>
"As to what we recommend, it depends on whether we feel the order is a valid 
order," he said. "We're going to have to assess that."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REPARATIONS FOR SLAVES' DESCENDANTS 
SUPPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Inglewood City Council has agreed to support the concept of federal 
government reparations for the descendants of slaves, but only after the 
resolution was broadened to include other ethnic groups that have suffered 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
A strongly worded resolution introduced by Councilman Garland Hardeman lamented 
the "barbarities of institutionalized slavery" on African-Americans and urged 
Congress to support a bill introduced by Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) to 
create a congressional committee to study reparations for slaves' descendants. 
</P>
<P>
To win the support of the city's two non-black councilmen, the measure noted 
that the city abhors injustices to all groups, but did not seek reparations.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CONSPIRACY COUNT AGAINST BUCKEY WILL BE 
DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A single count of conspiracy will be dropped against Manhattan Beach McMartin 
Pre-School defendant Ray Buckey, prosecutors said Wednesday, adding that they 
expect to proceed on the remaining 12 counts against him, with testimony from 
five children. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not intend to proceed with the conspiracy count, which will shorten the 
trial considerably and strengthen our case," Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Martinez told reporters after a 90-minute closed-door meeting with defense 
attorney Danny Davis and the new judge assigned to the trial, Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted in January of 
53 child molestation charges involving the now-defunct school. Jurors 
deadlocked on 13 other counts against Buckey and a new trial was ordered. 
Prosecutors have until Tuesday to file their amended complaint, and the trial 
is expected to begin Wednesday on schedule.

BLOCK SAYS HE'LL SEEK NEW TERM AS SHERIFF; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN: IN THE WAKE OF A DEPARTMENT SCANDAL, HE SAYS HE IS TAKING MEASURES TO 
GUARD AGAINST FUTURE PROBLEMS. 
</P>

<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, whose department has been rocked by 
money-skimming allegations, said Wednesday that he has filed for reelection in 
June and taken administrative steps to ensure that further scandals will not 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
Block, who has headed the nation's largest sheriff's department for more than 
seven years, said he has instituted a policy of requiring financial disclosure 
statements from some department officials. Although he would not identify the 
assignments that would require financial reviews, they reportedly include 
narcotics investigators, said several department officials and deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, 10 sheriff's officers -- including all nine members of an elite 
anti-drug team and the wife of one deputy -- were indicted on a variety of 
federal charges, including allegations of theft of $1.4 million in drug money, 
filing false tax returns and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
Although there has been no suggestion that the indicted officers were drug 
users, Block also said he has ordered top department officials -- including 
himself -- to undergo random drug testing. Eventually, he would like all 8,000 
officers tested. 
</P>
<P>
At his monthly media briefing, Block said he is taking the steps in part to 
help the department overcome the worst scandal in its history. "I honestly 
believe that from this point on, the course of events will contribute to a 
healing process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Block said that for the first time, he has ordered full financial disclosures 
by department workers in some areas. "It would not have 'red-flagged' those 
(indicted) at the time they entered the assignment," Block said. "But it 
provides an opportunity to readily see any unusual or significant changes in 
one's financial holdings." 
</P>
<P>
Block said he has "turned 180 degrees" on drug testing and is now requiring the 
testing as "a message to the community" that deputies are not involved in 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Shinee, chief counsel for the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, 
confirmed that his 6,000-member organization -- which represents the largest 
number of deputies -- is engaged in talks with sheriff's officials. But he 
stressed that "there is absolutely no correlation between the alleged theft of 
laundered money and the random drug testing." 
</P>
<P>
Block, 65, who was appointed to the job in 1982 and later won two full terms in 
office, defended his handling of the scandal and said he doubts that it will 
affect his reelection chances. 
</P>
<P>

GROUP'S LETTER CLAIMS IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THWARTED TRUCK BOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
An organization calling itself Up The IRS Inc. has claimed responsibility for 
leaving a powerful chemical bomb on the back of a pickup truck in West Los 
Angeles last week, and investigators said Wednesday that the group may be 
linked to other, similar bombings in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In a three-paragraph letter to the Santa Monica Outlook newspaper, the 
organization said it had targeted the Internal Revenue Service office on 
Olympic Boulevard because of "high, unfair and ambiguous taxes." 
</P>
<P>
The letter warned that the IRS and other, unnamed government agencies "can 
expect to see more of these events and with increasing severety (sic) with 
successive events." 
</P>
<P>
Excerpts from the letter were published by the Outlook on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're taking this seriously, since this is the second time they have 
claimed credit for bombing that building," said Rob Giannangeli, an IRS 
spokesman in Los Angeles. "Of course, whenever anything like this happens -- 
people doing destructive things because they don't agree with taxes -- (it) 
always causes us problems. But I want to emphasize that our people are just 
doing their jobs. They don't write the tax laws." 
</P>
<P>
Although Up The IRS Inc. also claimed credit for the Sept. 19, 1988, bombing of 
the underground garage beneath the same West Los Angeles office building, 
police said it was too early to say if the two letters are authentic or even 
from the same group. 
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman Fred Reagan declined to discuss the case, saying only that the 
agency had obtained the original letter from the newspaper and that it was 
being studied by specialists in a crime laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan also declined to say if the owner of the truck had been found, or 
questioned, or if authorities believe that the IRS was the intended target of 
the bombings. 
</P>
<P>
Other law enforcement officials, however, said that investigators are working 
under the assumption that the letter is authentic and that the organization may 
be linked to a third incident three years ago. In that case, handmade mortars 
were used to launch explosive devices at a Laguna Niguel federal building where 
the IRS has offices. The devices did not explode and no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
"There are just a lot of common threads," said Sgt. Bob Giles, an intelligence 
officer with the Orange County Sheriff's Department. "There are a lot of things 
that lead us to believe that this may be the same group." 
</P>
<P>
Giles said he has been working with a local and state task force, formed after 
the September, 1988, Los Angeles bombing, to determine if the same people or 
organization were responsible for all three incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone right now is going almost in the same direction, running a 
cooperative effort among the local FBI agents and all the police agencies 
involved," Giles said. 
</P>
<P>
No one ever claimed responsibility for the Laguna Niguel attack, in which at 
least two explosive devices were fired at the Chet Holifield federal building 
on the afternoon of March 2, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest incident, last Thursday, five 55-gallon steel drums filled with 
explosive chemicals were found loaded into the back of a Dodge pickup truck on 
Colby Avenue near Olympic Boulevard. Police said the drums were attached to 
detonators and had apparently been set to go off early Thursday when the truck 
was found burning. 
</P>
<P>
Bomb experts eventually disarmed and removed the drums after a tense day in 
which 16 blocks were evacuated and traffic was backed up for miles. 
</P>
<P>
IRS spokesman Giannangeli said the tax agency employs 230 people on the fifth 
floor of the City National Bank building in the 15500 block of Olympic 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, investigators have been reluctant to discuss the case, and 
they were not saying Wednesday if they believed that the letter claiming 
responsibility was authentic. 
</P>
<P>
The letter said the explosives were placed in the area to celebrate George 
Washington's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"George would have applauded and had a good laugh at the distress of the 
theives (sic) in the IRS office," it said. "It should be obvious that the 
timing of the event was intended to minimize the probability of harm to people 
and to maximize the disturbance and to maximize the cost to the IRS and their 
landlord, City National Bank. We are happy no one was injured and hope everyone 
enjoyed a leisurely day." 
</P>
<P>
The letter went on to explain that "the chemicals used are explosive (and quite 
common) and could have exploded because of the fire's heat or from the shock of 
one of the minor explosives that were set off. There were no detonators 
attached directly to the barrels. That would have produced an explosive 
equivalent to about 800 pounds of dynamite." 
</P>
<P>
Police would not comment on the accuracy of the letter's contents. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Patrick Metoyer, a supervisor with Los Angeles Police Department's 
criminal conspiracy section, said he had little information on the group, but 
added he suspected that "it is the same one" involved in the 1988 Los Angeles 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just trying desperately to identify the perpetrators of these 
incidents, to get these cases solved," he said.

TRUMP LOBBYING EFFORT DELAYS SCHOOL PLAN FOR AMBASSADOR SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

SACRAMENTO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid persistent lobbying by the organization of developer Donald Trump, an 
obscure state agency on Tuesday at least temporarily held up Los Angeles school 
officials' plans to build a high school on the Ambassador Hotel site. 
</P>
<P>
The victory for Trump, whose company owns the 24-acre site, climaxed a chaotic 
hearing of the state Allocation Board, which has the power to authorize funds 
for the school. Instead, the board granted a 60-day delay and called on the Los 
Angeles Unified School District to work out a compromise with the billionaire 
developer, who wants to build the nation's tallest skyscraper on the site. 
</P>
<P>
The decision infuriated Board of Education President Jackie Goldberg, who 
accused Trump of working behind the scenes to manipulate the governmental 
process. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't help but believe there is something unusual going on in this 
situation, and I think the unusual is Donald Trump," she said in an angry 
tirade after the hearing. "They simply have enough money to buy enough 
lobbyists to go absolutely everywhere and talk to as many people as need to be 
talked to until they get what they want." 
</P>
<P>
Cristina Rose, a lobbyist hired by Trump's company, said she had contacted each 
of the seven members of the Allocation Board before the meeting to urge them 
not to approve $120 million for construction of the school. She argued that 
Trump should have the opportunity to bring a development to the mid-Wilshire 
area that would rejuvenate the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"There really are competing interests here," she said. "One is to provide a 
development on that property that is truly going to revitalize that area. In 
addition, there is a need to house schoolchildren. What we would like to do is 
see if there's a way those competing interests can be worked out." 
</P>
<P>
For the last five years, Los Angeles school officials have searched for a site 
on which to build a high school that could serve the 4,000 students now being 
bused from the area to other schools at a cost of nearly $6 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
When the Ambassador Hotel closed its doors, Goldberg and other officials 
believed they had finally found the answer. But in recent months -- after the 
school district's plans were well under way -- Trump bought a share of the 
property and said he would put up a 125-story building on the site. 
</P>
<P>
The school district can take over the property through the power of 
condemnation, but only if it has the money to pay for the land. And that's 
where the state Board of Allocation comes in. 
</P>
<P>
The board, made up of four legislators, two appointees of Gov. George 
Deukmejian and one appointee of state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig, 
has the authority to grant state funds for school construction, including money 
from bond measures approved by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles district has won all the preliminary approvals necessary to 
qualify for funds from an $800-million bond measure planned for the ballot in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, members of the board balked at the huge price tag of $120 
million for just one school. Los Angeles officials estimate that $80 million 
alone would go for the purchase of the land. 
</P>
<P>
Rose and Barbara Res, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said 
the development company already has embarked on a detailed search for an 
alternate site for the school. 
</P>
<P>
One possibility would be to build two smaller schools on different sites -- at 
Beverly and Vermont and at Vermont and Washington -- which, they said, could 
serve even more students than the school planned for the Ambassador Hotel site. 
</P>
<P>
But Goldberg predicted that nothing will come from the negotiations -- noting 
that the company already has announced it has no legal obligation to aid the 
school district. 
</P>
<P>
The school board president said she expects Trump's company, Trump Wilshire 
Associates, to use the next 60 days to organize opposition to the school site 
among key state and local officials. 
</P>
<P>
As a case in point, Goldberg noted a 10-1 vote of the Los Angeles City Council 
earlier in the day calling the site inappropriate for a school. City Councilman 
Nate Holden, a backer of the Trump proposal, personally appeared before the 
Allocation Board to deliver the message.

COUNCIL PANEL SEEKS TO OPEN SHELTERS TO HOMELESS DURING SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A City Council committee Wednesday ordered two city agencies to offer shelter 
to the homeless on nights when aerial sprayings of malathion take place. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless would be housed in the same shelters that the city opens during 
cold and wet nights, according to the plan approved by the Community 
Redevelopment and Housing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Community 
Development Agency would be instructed to open recreation centers and other 
facilities "immediately . . . in communities that are being sprayed," said 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who proposed it. 
</P>
<P>
Buses would transport homeless people to shelters from specified pickup points. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said it would not be difficult for the city agencies to comply with 
the order, which still must get full council approval later this month. 
</P>
<P>
"As bad as the spraying is, it's not every night, seven nights a week, as cold 
weather can be during the winter," Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's decision was hailed by advocates for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Toni Reinis, co-director of the California Homeless Coalition, said, "I 
appreciate that the city is willing to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Reinis had been working with other organizations that petitioned the city to 
open the shelters. Homeless people in spraying areas have complained of 
flu-like symptoms and other health problems, she said, and many have no means 
of showering after the sprayings. 
</P>
<P>
"When malathion is sprayed over a neighborhood, people are advised to keep 
their pets inside," Yaroslavsky said. "It is morally indefensible not to 
provide people the same protection we tell pet owners to give their pets." 
</P>
<P>
Last month the Legal Aid Society of Orange County lost a bid for a temporary 
restraining order to halt the spraying of malathion. The lawyers demanded that 
the state give 48-hour notice of spraying to all homeless people, provide 
shelter during the spraying, as well as medical care and laundry services to 
those sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles committee also approved a proposal to develop a program to keep 
shelters open at night all winter next year.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST SPARKS CONTROVERSY; 
</P>
<P>
PREP SOCCER: QUESTIONS REMAIN IN WAKE OF PLAYOFF RESULT THAT WAS NULLIFIED BY 
THE SOUTHERN SECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
One week after the Southern Section forced a soccer playoff game between Santa 
Barbara San Marcos and Long Beach Millikan to be replayed because of an 
apparent conflict of interest, some questions remain unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
Why was this 3-A Division second-round game first officiated by a member of the 
Millikan faculty? Was it coincidence that two San Marcos players and an 
assistant coach were thrown out of the first game, which Millikan won? Who knew 
about this situation, and was the apparent conflict brought up before the game? 
</P>
<P>
Few of those involved are talking, but several facts are known. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 20, Millikan played host to and defeated San Marcos, 3-2, but its 
victory was nullified when it was discovered that referee Charles McKay, one of 
two officials who had worked the first match, is a long-term substitute teacher 
at Millikan. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos won the rematch ordered by the Southern Section, played at Santa 
Barbara High on Feb. 22, 3-2, but lost in the quarterfinals to La Canada St. 
Francis, 4-3, in overtime on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
McKay, who assigns officials to playoff games in the area, and Millikan Coach 
Rod Petkovic both denied charges of collusion in a hearing with the Southern 
Section the day after the game. 
</P>
<P>
McKay claimed that he decided to officiate the game only when two officials he 
had assigned did not show up. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section said, however, that the officials were never contacted by 
McKay and released this statement: "The first playoff game was declared no 
contest because it was determined that there was conflict of interest involved 
with a referee employed by the Long Beach School District." 
</P>
<P>
McKay, a respected international official in the United States, was also 
removed as the assignment official in the Long Beach area and was replaced by 
Gary Thompson, who had assigned officials during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Any further action against McKay will be taken by the Southern California 
Soccer Officials Assn., which will meet at a later date, according to Karen 
Hellyer, a Southern Section administrator in charge of soccer officials. 
</P>
<P>
Neither McKay nor Petkovic returned calls made by The Times, but Millikan 
Principal Wendol Murray denied that there had been collusion. 
</P>
<P>
"What Petkovic and McKay are guilty of is naivete, not collusion," Murray said. 
"I have to believe my coach (Petkovic) when he said he clearly presented McKay 
to the San Marcos coach before the game and said that one official did not show 
and if they wanted McKay, who is a respected official and also a Millikan 
substitute teacher, to do the game. 
</P>
<P>
"(Petkovic) then said that the San Marcos coach said, 'Let's play the game.' I 
have done further investigating and I have found out that they were just naive 
to think that the game could be played with an official employed on the 
Millikan faculty." 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos Coach Abe Jahadhmy said that he was never approached by Petkovic 
with that choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not aware that (McKay) was a teacher at Millikan," Jahadhmy said. "If I 
knew that, I would have never played the game. It was only after the game did I 
realize that he did." 
</P>
<P>
Jahadhmy also said that McKay dominated his officiating partner Jesus Galarza, 
who was contacted by McKay to work as a fill-in shortly before the game. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing that stands out is that McKay stayed on our end of play for the 
entire game," said Jahadhmy, who is in his third year of coaching at San 
Marcos. "Normally, officials do not switch sides at halftime, but McKay did, 
and when he was first asked, he said that the sun was in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"When I asked the other referee, he told me that McKay told him that he wanted 
to keep an eye on us and that (McKay) was the head ref and he can do whatever 
he wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
In the rematch, San Marcos took a 3-0 lead and then turned to backup junior 
varsity players before Millikan rallied and scored two late goals. Jahadhmy 
said that Millikan played better in its loss than it had in the first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Murray said no action has been taken against Petkovic or McKay. 
</P>
<P>
"I am waiting to hear from . . . CIF Commissioner Stan Thomas on what (the 
Southern Section will) suggest," Murray said. "I feel that McKay's action was 
done by an official working for the (Southern Section) and not as a Millikan 
employee. I do not think that we should take the rap for this." 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section said Wednesday that the matter is closed.

ESPN and the NFL reached agreement on a new $450-million, four-year contract, 
similar to one agreed to last week by Turner Broadcasting, which will have 
cable rights to Sunday night games during the first half of the next four 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN will get 35 regular-season Sunday night games in the second half of the 
1990-93 seasons, eight next season and nine in each of the next three. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN will also televise three exhibitions and the Pro Bowl each year. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, ESPN became the NFL's first cable outlet, televising eight 
Sunday night games in the second half of each season. It paid approximately $55 
million a year for the rights. 
</P>
<P>
The new contract averages out to $112.5 million a year.

Brea-Olinda High won its second consecutive Southern Section girls' basketball 
championship with a 50-33 victory over Palos Verdes Wednesday in the 3-AA title 
game at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda (30-0) won the 3-A and state Division III championships last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Aimee McDaniel scored 15 points and Tammy Blackburn held Palos Verdes' 
top scorer, Lisa Humphreys, to five points, as Brea-Olinda won its 51st 
consecutive game. It is the second-longest streak by a girls' Southern Section 
team. Riverside Poly has the record with 84. 
</P>
<P>
Humphreys came into the game averaging 15.4 points. She did not make a field 
goal until midway through the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes (27-5) was led by 6-foot-3 sophomore Monique Morehouse, who scored 
13 points. 
</P>
<P>
Despite building a 23-13 halftime lead, the Lady Cats hardly resembled the team 
that dominated three previous playoff opponents by an average of 30 points. 
They made only 10 of 25 first-half shots. But they pulled away at the start of 
the fourth quarter with a 9-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, Brea-Olinda showed the form that held its playoff opponents to an 
average of 36 points. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes made four of 25 shots in the first half.

ESTANCIA STOPS SERVITE IN OVERTIME, 51-49

Estancia High School's Agustin Heredia plays basketball as if he owns the game. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, the 5-foot-10 senior guard made a huge investment in 
Estancia's 51-49 overtime victory over Servite in the Southern Section 3-AA 
Division boys' basketball championship game in front of 4,428 fans in UC 
Irvine's Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
First, Heredia made a 12-foot baseline shot with three seconds remaining in 
regulation, tying the score, 46-46. Then he made five free throws to account 
for all of his team's points in the three-minute overtime, giving Estancia 
(20-5) its first Southern Section title. 
</P>
<P>
Servite (17-11) had taken a 46-44 lead when guard Paul Stapleton made a free 
throw with 13 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia called a timeout with nine seconds remaining and set up a play for 
Heredia, who finished with 32 points. Heredia hit nothing but net. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what he asked me during the timeout?" said Tim O'Brien, Estancia 
coach. " 'Do you want a two or a three?' There was no doubt he was going to 
make the shot and tie the game." 
</P>
<P>
Servite struggled to make its free throws, sinking only 13 of 27. At one point, 
Servite was 7 of 17 at the line.

DOS PUEBLOS WINS TITLE IN OVERTIME

<P>
Senior center Chris Gaines made a 19-foot jump shot in the final second of 
overtime to give Goleta Dos Pueblos a 39-38 victory over Corona del Mar in the 
Southern Section 3-A Division boys' basketball final Wednesday night in the 
Bren Center at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines' shot ended the lowest scoring 3-A title game ever as both teams shot 
under 40% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
The previous low in 21 years of Division 3-A title games was in 1971, when Dos 
Pueblos defeated Bellflower, 49-40. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar (19-10) appeared to have the game won when forward Jon Upham 
scored his only two points on foul shots with 18 seconds remaining in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
But Gaines used a double screen and swished a jump shot from the left side of 
the key to win it for the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"They had been overplaying me on my drives the whole game," said Gaines, who 
led all scorers with 22 points, including all seven overtime points for the 
Chargers. "I was just trying to get my shot off and when it left my hand it was 
kind of like a prayer shot." 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Gaines led the Chargers to a commanding lead. At one point, 
he had outscored the entire Corona del Mar team, 12-11. The Chargers (16-13) 
led at halftime, 22-15. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Sea Kings rallied in the third quarter, outscoring the Chargers, 
11-4, with guard Mark Flint leading the way with three assists and three 
points.

<TEXT>
<P>
In his last start against Montreal 11 days ago, Hartford goaltender Mike Liut 
stopped only four of eight shots before being lifted early in the second 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, things were different. Liut stopped 31 of 32 shots as the 
Whalers downed the Canadiens, 3-1, at Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
"Any player, a goalie, defenseman or forward can have an off night," Whaler 
Coach Rick Ley said. "That game was an off night." 
</P>
<P>
Liut, who was still rusty after knee surgery in the 7-3 loss at Montreal on 
Feb. 17, agreed. "I let in a couple of bad ones and I just wasn't there," he 
said. "Since then, I've played and practiced regularly and I'm better for it." 
</P>
<P>
Liut was beaten only by Stephane Richer who scored his 41st goal of the season 
late in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Young keyed the Hartford attack with two goals, including his fifth 
game-winner of the season with 5:08 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Young broke a 1-1 tie with a quick wrist shot from the lower left circle after 
passes from Pat Verbeek and Ron Francis to give Hartford only its second win in 
six games this season against Montreal. Verbeek added an empty-net goal with 23 
seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 7, Philadelphia 7 -- Tim Kerr scored his second goal of the game with 
31 seconds left in regulation as the Flyers rallied to tie the Canucks at 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
Kerr scored his 19th goal of the season after the Flyers pulled goaltender Ron 
Hextall with 42 seconds left. His shot from outside the faceoff dot in the left 
circle deflected into the net off goalie Steve Weeks' skate. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 5, Quebec 4 -- Vince Damphousse had a goal and three assists as the 
Maple Leafs edged the Nordiques at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kurvers, Gilles Thibaudeau, Gary Leeman and Daniel Marois also scored for 
the Leafs. But Leeman, the Leafs' leading scorer, went to the dressing room and 
did not return after straining his right shoulder while throwing a punch at 
Paul Gillis in a melee 38 seconds into the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 4, New York Islanders 3 -- Rookie Daniel Shank scored with 1:31 
remaining to lift the Red Wings over the Islanders at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Shank took a pass from Gerard Gallant near the New York blue line, outskated 
defenseman Joe Reekie and beat Mark Fitzpatrick from close range to end the Red 
Wings' five-game winless streak. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 2, New Jersey 1 -- Mark Recchi scored with 1:26 left in the third 
period as the Penguins defeated the Devils at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The win moved Pittsburgh into second place in the Patrick Division, one point 
ahead of the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
Recchi took a 15-foot shot that trickled through the pads of Chris Terreri to 
end Pittsburgh's two-game losing streak. The Penguins have won five consecutive 
home games. 
</P>
<P>
New York Rangers 3, Washington 2 -- Troy Mallette scored the tie-breaking goal 
49 seconds into the third period as the Rangers defeated the Capitals at New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Mallette broke a 2-2 tie on a breakaway as the Rangers beat the Capitals for 
the second time in six days. They are 6-1-1 in their last seven games against 
Patrick Division teams. 
</P>
<P>
After Mallette gave the Rangers a 3-2 lead, New York's penalty-killers held off 
two Washington power plays, including a two-man advantage for 34 seconds.

ROOKIE SMITH HELPS CELTICS BEAT MAVERICKS

<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Smith has come a long way in his rookie year with the Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, in his third start of the season, Larry Bird yelled at him 
to shoot. 
</P>
<P>
"When a guy like that tells you to shoot, that instills confidence in a 
player," Smith said. "It's great." 
</P>
<P>
Smith missed but still scored 21 points as the Celtics beat the Dallas 
Mavericks, 111-98, at the Boston Garden. Bird led all scorers with 31 points. 
Derek Harper scored 30 for Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Boston had lost four consecutive games before Coach Jimmy Rodgers substituted 
Smith for Ed Pinckney in the starting lineup for the last two games of an 
eight-game trip that ended Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In those two game, Smith, a 6-foot-10 forward, had a total of 40 points in 63 
minutes as the Celtics won both. Of his 182 points this season, 61 have come in 
the past three games. 
</P>
<P>
"With Michael Smith in the lineup, we're more active," said teammate Reggie 
Lewis. "He can take his man inside or outside." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that with Kevin McHale and Bird commanding most of the defense's 
attention, he has room to operate. 
</P>
<P>
"This is only three games (that he's started). We don't need to make a big deal 
about it," Smith said. "I'm still learning." 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks are 0-10 at Boston Garden in their 10-year history. The only 
other NBA city where they haven't won is Orlando Fla., but they've never played 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Bird missed a free throw with 6:41 remaining in the game, ending at 71 his 
streak of consecutive free throws made at home. His overall streak of 71, 
second in NBA history to Calvin Murphy's 78, ended at Houston on Feb. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 102, Indiana 99 -- Kevin Willis scored 19 points and grabbed 18 
rebounds to lead the Hawks at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive victory for the Hawks, who snapped Indiana's 
two-game winning streak and beat the Pacers for the first time in four 
meetings. Indiana had won seven of its past 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Dominique Wilkins also had 19 points for Atlanta, and Moses Malone added 17 
points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Miller led Indiana with 24 points, including three three-point baskets. 
Detlef Schrempf added 22 points and 11 rebounds and Chuck Person 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's basket with 35 seconds left cut the lead to 100-99. Wilkins made one 
of two free throws with 23 seconds to play and Person was called for traveling 
with eight seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
After Kenny Smith sank one of two free throws with under five seconds 
remaining, Miller missed a three-point shot at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Miami 113, Sacramento 92 -- Kevin Edwards scored 32 points, 16 in the first 
quarter, to lead the Heat at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards made 13 of 17 shots and six of six free throws as Miami won for only 
third time in 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
Antoine Carr led the Kings with 20 points. Vinny Del Negro, playing his first 
game after missing five with a sprained ankle, added 17. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 144, San Antonio 135 -- Rod Higgins scored nine of his 13 points 
in overtime and Chris Mullin set a team record with six three-point baskets to 
lead Warriors at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Mullin made his first five three-point shots and finished with six of eight 
overall and 36 points. Mitch Richmond had 28 points and Tom Tolbert added a 
career-high 27 for the Warriors, who broke a six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie center David Robinson had a career-high 38 points for the Spurs, 
including eight dunks and 17 rebounds. Terry Cummings added 28 points and tied 
his career high with 24 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs outrebounded the Warriors, 68-46, setting a franchise record with 37 
offensive boards.

UNHERALDED MULLER OUSTS TOP-SEEDED EDBERG IN INDOOR TOURNAMENT

Top-seeded Stefan Edberg became the latest upset victim at the Volvo Indoor 
tennis tournament Wednesday night as unheralded Gary Muller stopped the world's 
No. 3 player, 6-1, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Muller kept Edberg pinned to the baseline for most of the night as he used a 
low-bouncing serve and an assortment of strong passing shots to post the most 
impressive victory of his seven-year professional career. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt confident going into the match," Muller said. "I actually felt like I 
had a good chance." 
</P>
<P>
The second-round match with Muller was the first for Edberg since a stomach 
injury forced him to retire in the finals of the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I would have a problem," Edberg said. "I haven't played that well (in 
practice) since Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is not really hitting the ball. It's getting to it and then 
putting something into it. 
</P>
<P>
"Muller was on tonight. He played good tennis. he took advantage of my 
mistakes. That's why he won." 
</P>
<P>
Muller said the key to his victory was putting constant pressure on Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't able to gain any confidence early," Muller said. "I served fairly 
well and I didn't make any stupid errors. I kept my game together." 
</P>
<P>
Muller built a 5-0 lead before closing out the opening set with an ace. 
</P>
<P>
After trading service breaks with Edberg in the second set, the South African 
regained the edge in the 11th game when Edberg followed his serve to the net 
and then was unable to push a backhand into play, putting Muller up, 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
Muller served out the match at love, grabbing the victory when Edberg netted a 
running forehand. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg's loss left third-seeded Andrei Chesnokov as the highest-seeded player 
left in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Chang, the No. 2 seed, was bumped from the tournament on Tuesday night 
by Glenn Layendecker. 
</P>
<P>
Chesnokov survived a brief first-set rally by Roger Smith before settling down 
for a 6-4, 6-4 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I played my best game this year," said Chesnokov, ranked 19th in the 
world. "I had a good (service) return and I feel perfect." 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, seventh-seeded Marcelo Filippini of Uruguay defeated Brian 
Page, 6-3, 7-6 (7-3); West Germany's Michael Stich topped New Zealand's Kelly 
Evernden, 6-1, 6-2; qualifier Danie Visser eliminated No. 9 Paul Annacone, 7-5, 
6-7 (7-9), 6-4; and No. 12 Richey Reneberg beat Ken Flack, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Malivai Washington, a former University of Michigan All-American, defeated 
fifth-seeded Christo Van Rensburg, 6-4, 6-4, and Wally Masur of Australia 
topped Uruguay's Diego Perez, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Australian Darren Cahill had been worrying that his game was falling apart, but 
he put enough of the pieces together to top Tim Wilkison, 6-7 (6-8), 7-6 (7-0), 
7-5. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been playing well lately and to get out of a match like that has to 
be helpful," Cahill said after his three-hour battle with Wilkison.

Billy Hamill comes from a horse racing family. His father, Gordon, is a former 
jockey who is now the flagman starter for races at Santa Anita. His 
grandfather, Keith Stucki, is a veteran trainer who saddled Ancient Title when 
he set a track record at Santa Anita in 1978.

The family expected Billy to become a jockey. Except for one thing.

"I'm scared to death of horses," Hamill says. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he races motorcycles for a living. 
</P>
<P>
Hamill, who won't be 20 until May 23, has progressed so far, so rapidly, that 
he will leave his home in San Marino next week for England, where he will 
compete in the British Speedway League, the pinnacle for that unique form of 
racing in which 180-pound built-for-racing-only bikes have no brakes, only one 
gear, produce about 70 horsepower and will go from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in three 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy Hamill is the one rider whose name I would mention in the same 
conversation with Bruce Penhall's," said Harry Oxley, godfather of speedway 
racing and the person most responsible for developing Penhall from a Southern 
California surfer to two-time world speedway champion a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
"When kids come to me and say they're planning on going to England to ride, I 
know they're nearly always not ready, but Billy is light years ahead of his age 
and experience in ability. He uses strategy that you might expect from a guy 
who's been riding 15 years. If anything, I would say that Billy has more early 
talent than Penhall had. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect him to set the world on fire over there. He'll be the world champion 
within five years." 
</P>
<P>
Hamill will have one last fling at the Southern California speedway scene when 
he rides in the annual March Spring Classic, a three-race series that starts 
Saturday night at Long Beach Veterans Stadium and continues Sunday afternoon at 
Glen Helen Park in San Bernardino and next Friday night at the Orange County 
Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that I do good this week because I want my fans to remember me 
for good rides," Hamill said. "I'll be in England for eight months and won't be 
back except for the American Finals in June." 
</P>
<P>
Hamill, filled out to a muscular 140 pounds on a 5-foot-7 frame, will ride for 
Cradley Heath in the British League, the same team Penhall rode for when he won 
the world championship in 1981 and 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been after me for two years, ever since Bruce (Penhall) set up a trial 
for me over there when I was 17," Hamill said. "I could have gone last year, 
but I felt I had some things I wanted to accomplish. The offer they made me 
this year I would have been foolish to turn down." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in only his second year as a professional, Hamill won the season 
points championship for California tracks, finished second to veteran Bobby 
Schwartz in the U.S. Nationals and second to Steve Lucero in the state 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be a big turning point in my career," Hamill said. "I'll be racing 
with the best in the world, and I'll have (three-time world champion) Erik 
Gundersen as a coach. It should give me a chance to become a world contender." 
</P>
<P>
Gundersen, a Danish rider who won the world title in 1984, 1985 and 1988, 
suffered career-ending injuries in a spectacular four-rider crash during the 
World Team Cup matches last September in Bradford, England. Gundersen suffered 
a broken neck when he tangled with Lance King of Fountain Valley, Simon Wigg of 
Britain and Jimmy Nilsen of Sweden in what some observers called the worst 
accident in speedway history. All four were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Gundersen, 30, has been a Cradley Heath rider since 1979, when he became a 
teammate of Penhall's and was the team captain at the time he was injured. 
</P>
<P>
"Gundersen wants to stay involved with speedway, and he and I and Greg Hancock 
will live together. Hancock is from Costa Mesa, so I'll have a Southern 
California buddy with me on the team and I'll have Eddie Bull, who did the 
engines for Penhall's bikes, as my mechanic, so I can't wait to get going." 
</P>
<P>
Although everyone in the Hamill family thought Billy would become a jockey, the 
truth is that he has fantasized about becoming a speedway racer since he was 6 
or 7. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived in Duarte then, and I had a neighbor, Carlos Cardoza, who used to go 
to the races at Irwindale. He had a brother my age and we'd tag along. We'd 
come home and get on our bicycles and pretend we were speedway racers. We set 
up a course on Baylor Street and even had a starting gate we made with a bunch 
of rubber bands attached to a mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
"All the guys wanted to be Penhall, because he was the world champion then, but 
I was the littlest guy on the block so I was always Kelly Moran (a two-time 
national champion). I was so short I could barely straddle the bike and touch 
the ground. We really felt great when we got some old, bent-up handlebars from 
the speedway riders and put them on our bikes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny, at the time everyone wanted to become a speedway rider, but I was 
the only one who followed through." 
</P>
<P>
When Billy reached 13, he talked his parents into buying him a small speedway 
bike and joined the junior speedway program at local tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"I rode for three years but didn't do much because I didn't have a dad in the 
pits to help me. He was busy with his horses, and I did pretty much all my own 
work." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, when Hamill became old enough to ride on the professional circuit, he 
astonished his fellow riders by qualifying as one of the final 16 in the 
national championships. 
</P>
<P>
"I was still in school then and don't think I realized what I was doing. I just 
went out and rode as hard as I could. I remember the first time I lined up for 
a main event and looked around and saw Bobby Schwartz and Sam Ermolenko and 
Mike Curuso, fellows I'd been following since I was back on Baylor Street." 
</P>
<P>
Hamill graduated from Monrovia High in 1988, but he didn't make his graduation. 
The night before the big event, he was riding in San Bernardino when he and Jim 
Fishback tangled on the final lap and Hamill's foot got caught between 
Fishback's chain and rear sprocket. 
</P>
<P>
"The tendons were severed and I ended up in the hospital. I guess that was the 
worst accident I ever had, unless you count last year when I fell at Ascot and 
a guy ran over my head. It cracked my helmet, but all I got was some chipped 
teeth and a couple of stitches in the corner of my eye." 
</P>
<P>
Hamill already has some international experience. After the 1989 season, he was 
invited to Australia to ride against most of the world's best. In six races, he 
won two and finished second to Shawn Moran in an international meet. 
</P>
<P>
Other area riders planning on competing in England this year include Hancock, 
King, Ronnie Correy, William Hill, Shawn and Kelly Moran, and later in the 
year, Ermolenko, who is recovering from injuries suffered toward the end of 
last season. 
</P>

OFF ROAD -- Ivan (Ironman) Stewart, winner of the Parker 400 season opener and 
last year's Mint 400 in a V-6-powered Toyota truck, will defend his titles 
Saturday in the Nissan 400 -- a new name for the longtime Mint race. Stewart's 
victory at Parker was the first by a pickup truck in the race's 17-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan, in an attempt to win its own race, will counter with trucks driven by 
Roger Mears, Spencer Low, Jack Johnson and Sherman Balch. Low won the 
mini-metal class at Parker. Johnson, racing in the unlimited class, and Frank 
Snook, who drives a two-seat Raceco buggy, will be the first drivers off the 
line at 8 a.m. from the Las Vegas International Speedway, where the race will 
start and finish. More than 300 entries are anticipated by the sponsoring High 
Desert Racing Assn.

CBS REINSTATES ANDY ROONEY; HE'S BACK ON TV SUNDAY NIGHT

CBS reinstated humorist Andy Rooney to its "60 Minutes" TV program today. He 
said he'll be on Sunday's show with a commentary on the issues involved in his 
Feb. 8 suspension. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased," said Rooney, whom CBS News President David Burke had 
suspended without pay after a gay magazine quoted him as saying blacks had 
"watered down their genes," a comment Rooney denies making. Originally, the 
suspension was to be for three months, but the lifting of the suspension had 
been widely expected in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney said "I think it was a very difficult thing" for Burke to decide to 
reinstate him early, and he praised the news division president. Burke never 
specifically said why he suspended the 71-year-old commentator, and he did not 
say today why the suspension was lifted. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, Rooney drew fire from gay and lesbian groups for saying in a 
Dec. 28 CBS special that "homosexual unions" are among things that cause 
"self-induced" deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Since Rooney's suspension began, CBS has gotten more than 5,000 calls from 
viewers, virtually all supporting him. 
</P>
<P>
During his three weeks away from "60 Minutes," the program, while still 
top-rated, has slipped in the ratings, dropping to 18th last Sunday when it was 
beaten by a one-time rerun of ABC's hit "America's Funniest Home Videos."

Nobody had all six winning numbers in the mid-week California "Lotto 6-49" 
game, so the $5.46-million jackpot rolls over to build a Saturday jackpot as 
rich as $12 million, lottery officials said today.

There were four tickets with five correct numbers plus the bonus number, each

BUSH ASKS CONTRAS TO TURN IN WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush said today he was asking U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Contras to give 
up their weapons in the long struggle against the leftist Sandinista 
government, and expressed confidence they will do so. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was asked by reporters if he is worried that the rebels might refuse to 
lay down their arms despite the election victory Sunday of U.S.-backed 
opposition leader Violeta Barrios de Chamorro over Nicaragua President Daniel 
Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'm not worried, they will," Bush said as he left the Century Plaza hotel 
for another stop on his California visit. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was telling them to do so, he said, "Yeah, put it on the wire." 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro has asked the rebels to lay down their weapons and return home. Ortega 
similarly has asked for their disbandment. About 6,000 Contras, who were given 
millions of dollars in U.S. aid over the years, have been camped in bases in 
Honduras, which borders Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
A rebel spokesman said Wednesday the Contras were ready to discuss their 
position with Chamorro's party. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Bush praised law enforcement officials as "unsung heroes" as he toured a 
new 2,064-bed jail in Saugus that he said proved "tough talk is simply not 
enough" in fighting crime. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was given a tour of the not-yet-opened North County Correctional Facility 
by Sheriff Sherman Block, who showed him the Spartan cells in the 
maximum-security facility. 
</P>
<P>
A major part of Bush's own anti-crime package is concentrated on prison 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The President said after his brief tour: "I will never forget it. It was long 
enough to bring anyone face to face with the results of what institutions like 
this represent . . . capacity for violence, the power of corruption, the 
ability to turn our back on right and do wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Addressing law enforcement officers outside the prison, Bush said, "All too 
often you are the unsung heroes in the war on crime and our assault on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Facilities like the new $131-million jail show that 'tough talk is simply not 
enough. If you're going to be tough on crime, you've got to be tough on 
criminals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush then headed to address a luncheon gathering of the Republican Governors 
Assn. and later was to speak at a dinner of the California Chamber of Commerce.

Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, involved in an international custody battle over her 
daughter Hilary, can have her passport back so she can go to New Zealand to 
fight a lawsuit filed by her former husband, a judge ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
However, the passport is in the possession of the city's Court of Appeals and 
Judge Herbert Dixon of District of Columbia Superior Court said he could not 
order that court to return the document. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the appeals court said they expect motions on the case later 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Mittleman, an attorney for Dr. Eric Foretich, Morgan's former husband 
and Hilary's father, said she will oppose release of the passport. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said he was satisfied that the return of the passport was "in the best 
interests" of 7-year-old Hilary. The girl, who has been living with her 
maternal grandparents in Christchurch, New Zealand, was the subject of a 2 
1/2-year search by her father. Her whereabouts became known Friday.

16 DIE IN CAIRO LUXURY HOTEL FIRE;

EGYPT: AMERICAN AMONG VICTIMS OF WIND-SWEPT BLAZE STARTED BY SPARKS FROM OVEN

<P>
Fire whipped by strong winds roared through a luxury hotel early today, killing 
16 people and injuring 70, including many who suffered broken bones in jumping 
out windows or sliding down bedsheets to escape. 
</P>
<P>
The dead include at least one American, said U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Marcelle 
Wahba. She refused to release details about the victim. Three Americans were 
seriously injured, police Brig. Abdel-Rehim el-Kenawy said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire burned for nine hours at the six-story Heliopolis Sheraton northeast 
of Cairo, which had neither fire alarms nor sprinkler systems. Tourism Minister 
Fuad Sultan said the blaze started accidentally in the Nubian Tent restaurant, 
which was attached to one of the three wings of the T-shaped hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks jumped from a clay oven to the ceiling of the tent, igniting flames that 
quickly spread to the adjacent building, Sultan said. 
</P>
<P>
Winds of nearly 25 m.p.h. fed the flames, which destroyed much of the 630-room 
hotel, including its restaurants and elaborate lobby, where live birds flew 
among tropical plants and trees. 
</P>
<P>
When the fire broke out, there were about 1,000 guests and 300 employees inside 
the hotel, which is near the international airport. It was not known how many 
people were inside the Nubian Tent, where belly dancing and other entertainment 
is featured. 
</P>
<P>
"We were asleep when my wife got up and noticed some orange flames outside the 
window," said Fred Pirkey, a 57-year-old Atlanta real estate broker. From their 
sixth-floor room, "we made it through the smoke to the third floor," where a 
man was tying bedsheets together to attach to the windowsill. 
</P>
<P>
"With his help, we got around 20 people down to the roof of the ground floor 
below, from where we jumped to safety," he said. "We are very fortunate to be 
alive." 
</P>
<P>
One of those who went down via the sheet was a 72-year-old man from Battle 
Creek, Mich., Robert Louis Toohey, who said he crawled through the smoke from 
his sixth-floor room to the third floor. 
</P>
<P>
As he went down the sheet, Toohey said, he passed out, but a man on the ground 
caught him. Toohey was hospitalized for smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was worse than the landing in Normandy during the Second World War," said 
Toohey. "There, we were attacked and could fight back. In this fire, there was 
nothing to fight back with."

The 10-year-old Heliopolis Sheraton is the only one of Egypt's six Sheratons 
without an alarm system or sprinklers, Sultan said. They are not mandatory 
under Egyptian law but most first-class hotels began installing them in 1987.

Coal miners in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk staged a warning strike at 21 
mines today to demand the resignation of the entire regional Communist Party 
leadership, participants and news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven miners were in the third day of a hunger strike in front of the party 
headquarters in the city of 1.1 million people to back demands that party 
bosses quit en masse, Radio Moscow's Interfax news service said. 
</P>
<P>
But the party brass refused to consider resigning until a regional party 
conference scheduled for April 6-7, Interfax said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ukraine's entire Donbass coal belt was shut down for more than a week last 
summer as part of a nationwide coal strike by miners demanding better pay and 
improved working and living conditions.

NASA said today that the space shuttle Atlantis will return to Earth on Sunday, 
an announcement that may indicate that the five-member military crew has 
already deployed a $500-million spy satellite. 
</P>
<P>
In a three-sentence statement that is the first break in a Pentagon-imposed 
news blackout on the military mission, NASA said the "expected landing day" for 
Atlantis is Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
No landing times were provided. 
</P>
<P>
The mission is expected to last 4 1/2 days, ending with a landing at Edwards 
Air Force Base in California. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Atlantis) crew is doing well, and orbiter Atlantis continues to perform 
satisfactorily," the terse Mission Control announcement concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The cargo carried into orbit by Atlantis reportedly is a 37,300-pound satellite 
capable of taking super-sharp photographs and listening in on electronic 
communications around the world.

Greville Wynne, who spied on the Soviet Union for Britain during the Cold War 
and who spent 18 months in a Moscow prison after being caught, died of throat 
cancer Wednesday, hospital officials said today. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
The wealthy businessman, who described his exploits in two celebrated memoirs 
-- "The Man from Moscow" and "The Man From Odessa" -- worked for Britain's MI6 
Secret Intelligence Service. He said he acted as the intermediary for Soviet 
double agent Col. Oleg Penkovsky, a senior military intelligence officer who 
passed Moscow secrets to MI6 and the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition Labor Party legislator Ted Leadbitter said of Wynne in a statement 
to reporters Wednesday night: "How many secrets has this man taken to his 
grave?" 
</P>
<P>
Wynne set up his own business as an exporter of industrial engineering products 
in 1950, traveling often to Soviet Bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested during a trip to Budapest, Hungary, in 1962 and put on trial in 
Moscow in 1963 for spying and was sentenced to eight years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Penkovsky, who was tried with him, was sentenced to death for treason. He 
reportedly committed suicide in a Soviet labor camp. 
</P>
<P>
Wynne served 18 months in Moscow's Lubyanka Prison. He was freed in 1964 in 
exchange for Soviet spy Conon Molody, or Gordon Lonsdale as he called himself 
in Britain.

The government today invited applications for the first phase of a new program 
in which savings and loan institutions will compete for nearly $80 million to 
be used to promote affordable housing through cut-rate loans. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, included in last year's legislation to bail out the S&amp;L 
industry, the $78.7 million will be used to buy down the interest rates on 
certain housing loans, making the financing affordable to those whose incomes 
otherwise would be insufficient to make monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, who announced the program in 
his capacity as chairman of the Federal Housing Finance Board, said the loans 
made possible through the new program should add 20,000 units to the nation's 
stock of low- and moderate-income housing.

Treasury Undersecretary David C. Mulford suggested today that Poland is a 
candidate for reduction of the $10 billion it owes to banks under the plan 
proposed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. 
</P>
<P>
Mulford told a congressional panel that he and Brady were in Poland last 
weekend and that the question of reducing Poland's debt is under discussion. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Mexico has just signed an agreement with creditor banks, the 
first negotiated under the Brady strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Mulford also said Poland has just made another agreement to delay payments on 
the $27 billion it owes to creditor governments, including the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Poland has a total debt of more than $40 billion.

The U.S. economy declined in February for the 10th consecutive month, but at 
the lowest rate since last June, according to a survey of the nation's 
purchasing managers released today. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Purchasing Management's index rose to 48.3% in February, 
up from 45.2% in January, the trade association said. 
</P>
<P>
A reading below 50 indicates that the U.S. manufacturing economy is generally 
declining, above 50 that it is generally expanding. 
</P>
<P>
The February reading was the highest since June's 48.8%, the group said from 
its headquarters in Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
The new-orders portion of the survey increased for the first time since May, 
while production registered an increase for the first time since June. In 
addition, both new-export orders and imports continued to show increases, the 
group said. 
</P>
<P>
The employment portion of the survey declined for the 12th consecutive month, 
but the rate of decline was the lowest since June.

Lee A. Iacocca, while president of Ford Motor Co., tried to stage a coup by 
saying then-Ford Chairman Henry Ford II was senile and incapable of running the 
nation's No. 2 auto maker, a new book says. 
</P>
<P>
The book by former Ford executive Walter Hayes said Iacocca, now chairman of 
Chrysler Corp., made the move while Ford was traveling in China in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Later that year, Iacocca was fired by Ford, grandson of the company's founder, 
became Chrysler's president and rose to chairman in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The biography of Ford, who died Sept. 29, 1987, is to be published in June. 
Review copies of "Henry: A Memoir of Henry Ford II" were distributed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, who retired as vice chairman of Ford of Europe last year, said Iacocca 
met with Ford directors George Bennett and Joseph Cullman and "argued that 
Henry, still not 60 years of age, was senile and not up to the job and 
indicated that there were others in the company who shared his opinion." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Iacocca said the account was untrue.

Paul McCartney, in Tokyo to perform for the first time in 24 years, told 
reporters today he has no hard feelings about Japan's 1980 decision to bar him 
for a drugs offense. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney last visited with the Beatles in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested at Tokyo's Narita Airport in January, 1980, after customs 
officers found marijuana in his luggage. He was held for nine days before 
leaving the country. 
</P>
<P>
Japan normally bans foreigners with drug convictions from re-entering the 
country. The Justice Ministry gave McCartney the green light this time because 
he had no other convictions in the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Asked today if he has any hesitation in coming back to Japan after the 1980 
incident, McCartney said: "I don't have any bad feelings . . . so it's 
finished." 
</P>
<P>
"I have four children myself and I ask them to stay straight . . . don't use 
any drugs. I gave it up, I don't do it any more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of McCartney's six planned concerts here have already sold all the 
260,000 tickets available. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney kicked off his world tour in Los Angeles last fall.

MARTIN MULL TAKES 'A REAL JOB' AS LEAD IN NETWORK SITCOM

Martin Mull has temporarily deserted such off-beat pursuits as "The History of 
the White People in America" in order to appear in a network sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was high time I took a real job," Mull said in an interview. "I'd 
been having just too much fun all my life." 
</P>
<P>
After appearing in Norman Lear's syndicated "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman" and 
its spinoff, "Fernwood 2-Night," as well as the "White People" spoofs on pay 
cable, Mull now stars in "His &amp; Hers," a sitcom to premiere on CBS Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Mull plays Dr. Douglas Lambert, a divorced marriage counselor with two teen-age 
kids, who is remarried to Stephanie Faracy as Dr. Regina Hewitt, a 
never-before-wed marriage counselor. 
</P>
<P>
He found the pilot script for the show funny, "and I thought it had some chance 
to grow and change and be even funnier and more adult and sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
He feels unsure about the finished product -- and with some reason. 
</P>
<P>
The opening show has some very funny moments as it explores the infertility 
problems of its central characters, marriage counselors who have their own 
domestic problems. 
</P>
<P>
At the infertility clinic, when he is given a specimen container, he just 
smirks with embarrassment and takes off for a private room saying, "I'll just 
go in there and do whatever I'd do if I were in prison." 
</P>
<P>
Mull and Faracy are funny and their chemistry is good, and Blake Soper comes 
across as Mull's teen-age boy who gives off the emotional warmth of wallboard. 
There also is Fluffy, a white cat who looks as if she inspired Don King's 
hairdo. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not an animal hater," said Mull, who during the first show drops the cat 
out the window several times, "but that cat. . . . It would not hit a mark, and 
we were down an hour trying to get this thing to stay on a chair. If I was 
supposed to have animosity toward that cat -- it was not method acting."

NBC Entertainment and talk show host Larry King are talking about a possible 
pilot for an Ed Sullivan-type Sunday evening variety hour. 
</P>
<P>
According to King, he would offer the live program weekly from the stage of a 
New York theater, featuring "news makers in the audience and new acts, sort of 
a Sullivan for the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
The late Sullivan reigned on Sunday nights on CBS from 1948 until 1971, first 
as host of "The Toast of the Town" and from 1955 on as host of "The Ed Sullivan 
Show." His "really big shew" finally started to slip in the ratings and CBS 
dropped it. In recent years, variety shows have not done well as series on any 
network. 
</P>
<P>
King said the appearance four weeks ago of NBC Entertainment President Brandon 
Tartikoff on King's Mutual Radio talk show led to an off-air conversation in 
which Tartikoff asked if King would like to "expand his horizons." 
</P>
<P>
King over dinner this Tuesday night obtained an OK to do the pilot from his CNN 
boss, Ted Turner, for whom he does a weeknight "Larry King Live" show. 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff Wednesday was returning from Florida, where he was attending an NBC 
management meeting, and was unavailable for comment. A spokesman for NBC 
Entertainment said "there is no deal at the moment," but confirmed that "Larry 
King has had discussions with NBC." 
</P>
<P>
King said his understanding was that a pilot could air on the network as early 
as May.

The heavy metal band Motley Crue stormed off the stage for 20 minutes after 
lead singer Vince Neil got hit in the face with a cup of ice. 
</P>
<P>
Neil was treated for superficial injuries after Wednesday's concert at the 
Rushmore Plaza Civic Center, said Louis Heidelmeier, a spokesman for Elektra 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
Neil dodged plastic squeeze bottles, undergarments and other items thrown on 
stage throughout the opening numbers. He rebuked the crowd and said the band 
would leave if the trashing continued. When the cup of ice hit him during the 
next song, he unplugged his guitar and the band left the stage. 
</P>
<P>
After a hiatus, Motley Crue returned and finished the concert, Heidelmeier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said about 70 people were arrested for underage consumption of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
The heavy metal band -- once known for its heavy drug and alcohol use -- is 
touring the U.S. promoting their "Dr. Feelgood" album, the first since the 
group declared its sobriety.

David Brazil, who came to Pittsburgh last year when Rod Rust was hired to run 
the Steelers' defense, was named today to replace his former boss as defensive 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil, 53, worked under Rust for two seasons, with Kansas City in 1988 and the 
Steelers last season. 
</P>
<P>
He has coached for 30 seasons, including 10 in Michigan high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Rust was hired Tuesday as the New England Patriots' coach. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, free-agent quarterback Randy Wright confirmed he has reached terms 
with the Steelers on a pair of one-year contracts. Wright will be paid $350,000 
in 1990, including a signing and reporting bonus, the Post-Gazette reported. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, 29, who did not play last season after being cut by Green Bay at the 
end of training camp, also had been courted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as a 
backup to starter Vinny Testaverde.

The Major League Baseball Players Assn. told Detroit Tigers working out 
together in Lakeland, Fla., to disband because the group practices were sending 
the wrong message to owners during negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives the owners the false impression that we can't wait to get started," 
pitcher Frank Tanana said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than a dozen players had been working out at Henley Field, about a mile 
from the Tigers' spring training site at Joker Marchant Stadium, because of the 
owners' lockout. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I'm disappointed it was perceived that the workouts meant we 
weren't unified," Tanana said. "We just saw it as an opportunity to stay in 
shape. But if that was what the owners were thinking, then we'll take that out 
of their minds." 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers have canceled all their home exhibition games through March 12, and 
the American and National leagues have advised teams that no games will be 
played until 10 days after players report to camps.

MICHIGAN'S HOARD GOING FOR NFL

Michigan tailback Leroy Hoard, whose Rose Bowl heroics two years ago helped 
make him a big name to Wolverine football fans, will forgo his final year of 
college eligibility and enter the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of my decision had nothing to do with money. 
</P>
<P>
I'd always wanted the chance to play in the NFL," Hoard said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan Coach Gary Moeller said he disagreed with Hoard's decision. "However, 
this is his option year, and he must make the decision. We wish him the very 
best." 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, Hoard was the most valuable player in the Rose Bowl as Michican 
rolled over USC, 22-14. He rushed for 752 yards that season. Last season, he 
rushed for 832 yards. He scored 19 touchdowns and averaged 5.4 yards per carry 
during his career. 
</P>
<P>
Hoard said he feared a knee injury similar to that suffered last November by 
teammate Tony Boles, who may be unable to play football again unless he 
switches from running back to another position.

LIFE AFTER BLONDIE; 
</P>
<P>
DEBORAH HARRY'S SAN JUAN DATE MAY INDICATE WHETHER SHE CAN REGAIN PLATINUM HIGH 
GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like it or not, pop culture revolves around the creation of appealing, salable 
images that will set off Pavlovian bells in a mass audience's collective brain. 
Deborah Harry looks back with pride on her own contribution to the mythology of 
pop image-making: the creation of Blondie. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always fascinated with film stars," Harry said in a recent phone 
interview from a tour stop in San Francisco. (She opens a three-night stand 
tonight at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano.) "What I did with Blondie 
was take the blond sex-symbol film star and put her in front of a band. That's 
why people fell for that right away. They recognized what (the image) was, and 
this was a new way of seeing it." 
</P>
<P>
Transposing already-existing pop-culture currents into new settings became the 
foundation for Harry's success with Blondie, a name that applied both to her 
persona as a bleached-blond pop siren, and to the six-member band that she 
fronted in 1975-82. 
</P>
<P>
Blondie emerged from the New York City New Wave rock movement that also begat 
such influential bands as Television and Talking Heads. Blondie was the most 
lighthearted, pop-savvy of those bands, and the first to hit it big. At the 
start, Blondie transposed pure-pop forms from the '60s -- including surf music 
and girl-group rock 'n' roll -- into the rough, hard-edged setting that defined 
the New Wave bands and their punk rock offspring. 
</P>
<P>
But it was by assimilating such '70s and early-'80s pop trends as disco, rap 
and reggae that Blondie really came to prominence. In 1979-81, that approach 
gave Blondie four No. 1 hits: the disco-tinged originals "Heart of Glass," 
"Rapture" and "Call Me," and "The Tide Is High," a remake of a Jamaican reggae 
tune. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris Stein really gets the credit for that," said Harry, 44, referring to the 
guitar player who has been her mate and collaborator since before Blondie 
began. 
</P>
<P>
Disco and rap were "what was in the air, and he was fascinated by it and tried 
to incorporate that in what we were doing." 
</P>
<P>
Harry went along willingly -- "I was always interested in rock music and 
shaping it in different ways." 
</P>
<P>
But other Blondie members were not happy with the stylistic dabbling, and 
musical dissension contributed to the band's breakup. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Harry had already launched a career of her own with a 1981 album, 
"KooKoo." But something all-to-real interrupted her image weaving: Stein came 
down with a rare, debilitating genetic illness called pemphigus. Harry put her 
recording career on hold while he recovered. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something that's a very valuable lesson," Harry said of the illness, 
which she said can be brought on by severe stress. "Chris is a worrier, and 
maybe this is something he had to figure out. You can destroy yourself with 
worry -- many people do. It's something he just had to learn to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
For herself, Harry said, the experience "gives you a hip perspective about 
values. It just gives me a better point of view, period, whether as a performer 
or in anything else I do. I just appreciate life a little bit more." 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Harry and Stein went back to touring for the first time since their 
Blondie days, promoting Harry's current album, "Def, Dumb &amp; Blonde." (Harry 
had remained active in her side career as an actress, taking roles in the TV 
series "Crime Story" and "Wise Guy," and a fun turn as a comically villainous, 
rock-hating matron in the John Waters film, "Hairspray.") 
</P>
<P>
Like "Rockbird," a 1986 album that she did not promote with touring, "Def, Dumb 
&amp; Blonde" is given to the alternately dreamy and sassy romantic personas 
that Harry has portrayed on record since Blondie rose to popularity. 
</P>
<P>
"This last record was an attempt to reach as many people as possible, to make a 
very commercial record," Harry said. "Because of my business situation, I was 
trying to re-establish myself and get a record deal. I had to make a specific 
kind of record." 
</P>
<P>
The album has failed thus far to crack the Billboard Top 100, but Harry 
continues to plug away. She recently completed a month of arena touring as an 
opening act for Tears for Fears. The next step is touring in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"There are pockets (of strong sales), but an overall sweep didn't happen for 
the record," she said. "I haven't really been in the public eye as I once was. 
That's why I'm out promoting the record. People start to remember you and play 
your record -- witness Bonnie Raitt." 
</P>
<P>
Is Harry contemplating the sort of stubborn trouper's approach that Raitt 
followed as she toured through some lean years before her current, 
Grammy-anointed success? 
</P>
<P>
"We'll see what happens," Harry said. "I'm really enjoying playing and writing 
and performing. I'm not making big decisions about my future." 
</P>
<P>
The focus on romantic songs in her two most recent albums does not mean that 
the zany, kitsch-loving sensibility that cropped up in Blondie from time to 
time is gone, Harry said. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the next (album) will be a little bit weirder," said the co-author of 
songs about ants who destroy humankind, jetliners that go down in the Bermuda 
Triangle and Martians who devour discotheques. Harry continues to work Blondie 
favorites into her shows. If she sings the deliciously catty Blondie song "Rip 
Her to Shreds," it could be directed at a certain star who has followed Harry's 
lead in bringing the Marilyn Monroe, blond-bombshell image into the pop music 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sort of up-tight that (Madonna) did it in such an obvious way after I 
had already done it. But it's fine -- I don't cop to owning any privileges or 
rights," Harry said, before breaking into a wry laugh of confession. "I was 
(mad) that she was so successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Harry and Thirteenth Step play tonight through Saturday at the Coach 
House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tonight's show starts at 
8; Friday's and Saturday's start at 9 but are sold out. Tickets for tonight:

FIRST MOTHER: WASHINGTON SLEUTH; 
</P>
<P>
A ROOSEVELT SCION'S MYSTERIES ARE SET IN THE F.D.R. WHITE HOUSE

<TEXT>
<P>
Her energy was boundless, her intelligence keen, her compassion infinite, but 
solving crimes was not one of the gifts attributed to Eleanor Roosevelt in her 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
It remained for her son Elliott to imagine his mother as a sleuth, and by now, 
he has led her through seven mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent, "Murder in the Rose Garden" published late last year by St. 
Martin's Press, begins with the discovery of the body of a well-known 
Washington hostess in the very shadow of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
A suspect is close at hand. But it is a sacred truth of mysteries that the 
obvious suspect is never guilty. Mrs. Roosevelt, equally concerned to protect 
the innocent and to discover the murderer, soon nudges a Secret Service 
detective and the Washington cops toward the lurid truth. 
</P>
<P>
Another presidential descendant, Margaret Truman, also has turned to 
mystery-writing. Hers are set in contemporary Washington and enriched by her 
familiarity with the workings of that peculiar environment. Harry Truman 
himself has retired to history in his daughter's work, although in "Murder in 
the CIA," his testy remarks about the agency are quoted at length as a kind of 
posthumous vindication of his wisdom. (The two authors, Roosevelt says, have 
never compared notes.) 
</P>
<P>
Elliott Roosevelt's mysteries are set in the White House of the F.D.R. years, 
1932-45, and the considerable charm of the books resides in the son's sketches 
of his mother and father, of Missy LeHand, Harry Hopkins and the other 
historical figures from those days, and of small details of daily life on 
Pennsylvania Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
In "Murder in the Rose Garden," for example, F.D.R. complains about the quality 
of the cooking in the White House. All too true, Elliott Roosevelt said the 
other day. Now 79, he moved not long ago from Palm Springs to Scottsdale, where 
he and his wife Patty live. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't get a good meal in the White House," Roosevelt said. "Neither 
Mrs. Nesbitt, who'd come down from Staatsburg, N.Y., . . . to be the 
housekeeper, nor Mother had an idea of what a gourmet meal was." 
</P>
<P>
Food was simply not one of Eleanor Roosevelt's priorities, and that makes a 
funny submotif that only someone who was there could have known about and 
written. 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt has a long if intermittent history as a writer. A licensed pilot 
since 1928, although he has not flown in five years, he was aviation editor for 
Hearst Newspapers for a time starting in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
In "Murder in the Rose Garden," Mrs. Roosevelt mentions that Elliott is 
interested in flying to Europe in a dirigible. True, he says now. "I was very 
much taken with the possibilities of the dirigible for transportation." It's 
another of the small echoes between fiction and reality that give the Roosevelt 
mysteries their curious mix of credibility and make-believe. 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt, who has come to look more and more like his father as the years have 
gone by, has had a hand in several other books, starting in 1946 with "As He 
Saw It," his account of his travels to wartime conferences, including Yalta, as 
an aide to F.D.R. 
</P>
<P>
He also edited four volumes of his father's letters, and, with James Brough, 
co-wrote four books about the Roosevelt family. The first of those, "An Untold 
Story" in 1973, brought down upon him the wrath of his siblings, and many 
critics, for its revelations about F.D.R.'s private life, notably his 
relationship with Lucy Mercer, who was with the President when he died at Palm 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Missy LeHand, also mentioned in "An Untold Story," is prominently featured in 
"Murder in the Rose Garden" as well, having a quiet dinner off a tray at the 
President's bedside while Mrs. Roosevelt is entertaining the black leader, Mary 
McCleod Bethune, more formally elsewhere in the White House. (Missy's testimony 
about the departure of a visitor to F.D.R. crucially indicts one suspect and 
clears another.) 
</P>
<P>
The bedside supper is deeply affectionate, if not romantic, but the author says 
the get-togethers were both customary and innocent. "It wasn't the kind of 
romantic interlude you might think," Roosevelt says. "Missy had a very strong 
relationship with my mother, as well. She had her own quarters on the third 
floor, like a member of the family." She died in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt's last book before the mysteries began in 1984 with "Murder and the 
First Lady" was "The Conservators." It appealed, he says, "to the delving mind. 
It was a think book that involved a lot of research and took me two years to 
write." There appears to have been an insufficiency of delving minds, and 
Roosevelt says wryly that a friend told him it was the greatest book to cure 
insomnia he'd ever found. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to do something livelier," Roosevelt admits. He considered romance 
novels but his wife pointed out that his track record in that area was not 
terrific. He has been married five times, although the fifth, to the former 
Patricia Whitehead, has now lasted 30 years. (Overall, the five Roosevelt 
children had 19 marriages among them.) 
</P>
<P>
Mysteries were a logical next choice. His father, Elliott Roosevelt remembers, 
read one almost nightly to get himself to sleep, and admired Dashiell Hammett. 
F.D.R. even wrote a mystery himself, his son says, for Liberty Magazine, which 
invited readers to contribute their own solutions. F.D.R. varied the mysteries 
with Westerns and read much of Zane Grey's voluminous output. 
</P>
<P>
Having opted to try his hand at mysteries, why Eleanor Roosevelt as his sleuth? 
Because, her son says, "She was the most perceptive person and had the most 
analytical mind of anyone I've ever known. She had all the attributes of a 
first-rate detective." 
</P>
<P>
He adds, with a grin, "There was nothing I did that she didn't ferret out 
before I even had a chance to tell her the truth." 
</P>
<P>
The plots have come so easily that he is now three books ahead: two more will 
be published later in 1990 and a third in 1991. He already has begun writing a 
new series, with a different protagonist, but in the same time frame, he says. 
</P>
<P>
He is also working with a Phoenix author, Dean Smith, who wrote a biography of 
the Goldwater family and hopes to do a biography of Elliott. Of the Roosevelt 
children, only James, now 81 and gravely ill in Southern California, and 
Elliott remain, although there are large numbers of grandchildren and 
great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott is still called on to defend his father's memory from the enduring 
F.D.R.-haters. Only a few weeks ago, a Phoenix newspaper ran a piece 
reiterating the old charges that a weakened Roosevelt was out-bargained by 
Soviet leader Joseph Stalin at Yalta. The son wrote a stinging retort, which at 
last reports had not been published. "Contrary to what was said about 
(F.D.R.'s) being weakened and his judgment impaired, he was extremely sharp at 
Yalta," Elliott Roosevelt says. "He wasn't subject to being browbeaten." 
</P>
<P>
F.D.R. had been hard hit by the death of his close friend and military adviser 
Maj.-Gen. Edwin (Pa) Watson. He had lost his political confidant from Albany 
days Louis Howe in 1937 and Missy LeHand in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
It also was true, he admits, that F.D.R. aged rapidly after the 1944 campaign. 
He had caught a bad case of bronchitis while campaigning in New York in an open 
car in freezing weather; the bronchitis became a siege. The President was 
rarely seen in public in a wheelchair, but, addressing Congress after Yalta, he 
chose to sit rather than stand. 
</P>
<P>
"He himself always believed he would live to see the end of the war and 
accomplish the things he wanted to do after finishing his presidency," 
including writing of his own, probably in the field of American naval history, 
about which F.D.R. was a well-informed student, his son says. 
</P>
<P>
The son does his work in the morning. "My mind works better in the early 
hours," he says. He dictates into a tape recorder, deciding on characters first 
(real and fictional), then working back from the solution, dividing the story 
into chapters and figuring, he says, how many red herrings to drag across the 
trail. "If you're not careful," he says, "you can get too enthusiastic about 
red herrings. You have to be sure you don't overload it." 
</P>
<P>
There are some tricky problems in the series; not the least of them is getting 
his mother involved with the crimes, the settings and the police without 
straining credibility. 
</P>
<P>
The mysteries, he thinks, are a good way to get people interested in history, 
who, essentially, aren't interested in history at all. "They don't want to read 
a history book but this is a good way to tell stories and catch their 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
Being the son of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt was a blessing as mixed as 
blessings get, not unlike being a film star, Elliott Roosevelt ruefully admits, 
adding that it took him a while to realize that the flattery was often 
deceptive and sometimes expensive. "People would talk about your skills, your 
knowledge, your abilities, but they were just hoping to use you as an entering 
wedge." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, he was under investigation by a congressional committee in 
complex matters involving stolen securities and an attempted assassination of a 
governor of the Bahamas. In the end, he was exonerated, but that fact, he says 
fatalistically, "made one paragraph on the obituary pages." The selective 
attention was another aspect of being a Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt has done many things in his life, including being, in his 20s, a 
rodeo contestant, an outgrowth of childhood summers on a dude ranch in Wyoming. 
He competed under the alias "Robertson" after he was identified "as the nephew 
of another great Westerner, Theodore Roosevelt." Later, he owned a cattle ranch 
in Colorado, and still later, lost his shirt in a uranium enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
His mysteries have not yet enjoyed a blockbuster break-through, although one 
made a brief appearance on the Los Angeles Times best-seller list; "Murder in 
the Oval Office" went through several printings. All the earlier books are in 
print in Avon paperbacks.

MARATHON: CANADIAN RUNNER WILL GO FOR HIS THIRD VICTORY IN LOS ANGELES RACE ON 
SUNDAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Art Boileau, a world-class marathoner, stopped at customs during a visit to 
Calgary, Canada, last Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"What's your occupation?" the border guard asked. 
</P>
<P>
Boileau paused. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't tell him that I was a professional marathon runner because I didn't 
think he'd believe I can make a living running," Boileau said. 
</P>
<P>
So Boileau lied, saying he was a student. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Boileau earns a comfortable living running in two or three marathons 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
A full-time runner, Boileau is sponsored by a shoe company that signed him to a 
two-year contract after he won the 1989 Los Angeles Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was cooked until last year, and then I won the L.A. Marathon and 
they gave me a new contract," Boileau said. "There's not a lot of security in 
(marathon running). You're only a hamstring pull away from an eight-hour 
workday. You're only as good as your last race. As soon as the next guy wins a 
race, sponsors are all over him." 
</P>
<P>
A two-time champion of the Los Angeles Marathon, Boileau has earned $100,000 
and two cars for winning the 26.2-mile race. He will be back to defend his 
title in the fifth Los Angeles Marathon Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Boileau won the 1987 Los Angeles Marathon, and won again last year when Gidimas 
Shahanga, who led for much of the race, slowed to a walk after developing 
cramps in a hamstring. He finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Plaatjes, who was running strongly, dropped out with blisters 18 miles 
into the race. Boileau, running a conservative race, took advantage of the 
misfortunes of Shahanga and Plaatjes to win. Boileau ran 2:13.01, well over the 
course record of 2:10.19, set by Martin Mondragon of Mexico in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although Boileau won, he was overlooked by sportscasters broadcasting the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I was watching (the race) on TV wondering where Art was because he was never 
mentioned by the commentators," said Bill Dellinger, Boileau's longtime coach. 
"They kept talking about the top three guys, and all of a sudden (Shahanga) was 
way out in front, and they kept talking about how he was going to win it 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
"They never mentioned Art till all of a sudden I saw this guy go running by. I 
recognized it as being Art, and the people on the TV didn't even know who it 
was. I don't think he should have been overlooked. But it'll probably be that 
way again this year. They'll be talking about the guy who's going to win it, 
but watch out for Art." 
</P>
<P>
Accustomed to the cooler climate of Eugene, Ore., where he trains, Boileau is 
hoping for similar weather Sunday because he doesn't run well in warm weather. 
</P>
<P>
In 84-degree heat at the 1984 Olympic marathon, Boileau, running for Canada, 
wilted and finished 44th. Running in hot weather at Seoul, he finished 28th. 
</P>
<P>
"When it gets hot, I just run so conservative," said Boileau, 32. "Last year it 
was warm and I adjusted my pacing. But sometimes I'm too conservative. You 
don't want to cut your throat, but you've got to run aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
After finishing sixth in the two-mile at the 1976 Oregon high school track 
meet, Boileau didn't think he was good enough to make the track squad at the 
University of Oregon, so he didn't go out for the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just come out of high school and I had the perception that you had to be 
star to run for Oregon," Boileau said. "I didn't know if I really belonged 
here." 
</P>
<P>
But when Boileau enrolled in a jogging class taught by Dellinger, the Oregon 
track coach, Boileau impressed the coach enough that Dellinger asked him to 
join the track team. 
</P>
<P>
Overshadowed by teammates such as world-class runners Alberto Salazar and Rudy 
Chapa, Boileau felt intimidated in workouts. 
</P>
<P>
A steeplechaser and 10,000-meter runner, Boileau ran for the Ducks from 
1976-79. He also ran on the cross-country team, which won an NCAA championship 
in 1978 and was the NCAA runner-up in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"Art could have been a star in any other program," Dellinger said. "But in the 
program with those guys, nobody knew who he was." 
</P>
<P>
Boileau blossomed into a good marathon runner after he graduated. 
</P>
<P>
The year after he left Oregon, he ran 2:13.38 in his first marathon, finishing 
sixth in a low-key race at Eugene. His breakthrough came when he finished 11th 
in the 1983 World Championships at Helsinki in 2:11.30. 
</P>
<P>
Boileau ran a personal best of 2:11.15 and finished second in the 1986 Boston 
Marathon behind Rob De Castella. 
</P>
<P>
"I always think, 'If De Castella hadn't run it, would I have won?' " Boileau 
said. "I don't think so. He was so fit that year that he beat me by 3 1/2 
minutes. He went out hard and took a lot of guys with him. By the 18-mile mark, 
I was jumping over dead bodies." 
</P>
<P>
After winning the 1987 L.A. Marathon in 2:13.08, he didn't compete here in 1988 
because of a dispute with promoter Bill Burke over appearance money. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar, a former world record-holder in the marathon, said he isn't surprised 
by Boileau's success. 
</P>
<P>
"Art's one of those guys who has kept working hard, and he's continued to 
improve," Salazar said. "Starting out, he didn't have the credentials that 
other guys had in college, but whereas a lot of those guys burned out, got 
injured or didn't continue to improve, Art's gotten better and better." 
</P>
<P>
Said Boileau: "Marathon running is an older man's game. As you get older, you 
fine-tune your training program and eliminate what doesn't work. You get 
stronger with age. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm getting better every year, but you kind of wonder how many more 
good years you have left. I think I've got three or four more good years left 
because I haven't really abused my body like some guys have. I've always 
trained with the long term in mind." 
</P>
<P>
Dellinger, who has coached Boileau for 14 years, doesn't think he has reached 
his potential. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the ingredients to being a great distance runner is patience," 
Dellinger said. "You grow into being a great distance runner, it doesn't happen 
overnight like a miracle. And Art's patient. He's taken the time and has been 
willing to put in the work and sacrifice that's involved to grow into being 
better and better. And right now he's one of the top marathoners in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"You can achieve stardom too soon. Unless you're hungry, you have a hard time 
running, and I think Art's still hungry. He still hasn't received all the 
recognition due him, and I think he would like to win the New York Marathon and 
win a gold medal in the Olympics. He still has that burning desire to want to 
be better because he hasn't reached the top yet." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent afternoon at Oregon's Hayward Field, a dozen of the Ducks' current 
and former distance runners met for a workout. 
</P>
<P>
The group included Dan Nelson, a former NCAA champion in the steeplechase, 
Boileau and Salazar, who is attempting a comeback after several years of 
inactivity because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us know that workouts mean nothing as far as proving anything," Salazar 
said. "The people that are looked down upon the most are people that do great 
workouts but can't come close in a race. Those guys are workout kings." 
</P>
<P>
After warming up, Boileau led the group on an eight-mile training run at a 
six-minute mile pace along Prefontaine's Trail, one of the many running trails 
along the Williamette River. 
</P>
<P>
Boileau kept the group loose during the run with his constant chatter and 
jokes. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the hard part running along with him is that he's got you laughing 
so hard that you've almost got to stop because you'll be hurting so much," 
Salazar said. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to Hayward Field, they did another five miles on the track, at a 
five-minute mile pace. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing that the pace was too fast as he called out splits, Dellinger told them 
to slow down. But they paid no heed, increasing the pace to 4:20. Despite the 
pace, Boileau ran comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
After the others had finished, Boileau ran two extra miles. Boileau had already 
run 10 miles in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
After two days of easy workouts, Boileau and the group would have another hard 
run. 
</P>
<P>
A three-time Olympian and former Olympic track coach, Dellinger doesn't believe 
in excessive training for a marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you train to run a marathon, you train to run a 5,000 and 10,000 
and you race a marathon," Dellinger said. "When you start training to run a 
marathon, you tend to run too many miles." 
</P>
<P>
Boileau met his future wife, Ranza Clark, while running. 
</P>
<P>
A Canadian Olympian in the 800 and 1,500, Clark met Boileau at a meet in 
Saskatoon, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Although Boileau was born in Edmonton, Canada, his family moved to Portland 
when he was 10 and he has remained in Oregon. But he retains his Canadian 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
"We just started warming down together after a race," Clark said. "I didn't 
really know him and I didn't know much about men's running. Other than my own 
event, I didn't even follow track very much." 
</P>
<P>
The relationship blossomed after Clark moved from Calgary to Eugene to attend 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Boileau and Clark will be married in May. Clark wants to honeymoon in Africa, 
so they can run in Kenya's Great Rift Valley, which is home to some of the 
world's great distance runners. 
</P>
<P>
Clark doesn't plan to accompany Boileau to the L.A. Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never gone to L.A., and he's done so well down there that I feel if I go 
and he doesn't do well it'll be my fault," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
So, she'll be waiting for a call after the race.
