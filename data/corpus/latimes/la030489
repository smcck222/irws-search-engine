ACUPUNCTURISTS SEIZED IN STATE EXAM BRIBERY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Forty-seven California acupuncturists were charged Friday in connection with an 
alleged seven-year scheme in which a state licensing official peddled answers 
to acupuncture licensing exams in return for at least $500,000 in bribes. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the Los Angeles County district attorney's office swept 
through Koreatown and other areas of Los Angeles and Orange counties, arresting 
16 Korean acupuncturists on charges of bribery. Others remained at large late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The sweep capped a yearlong investigation into allegations of corruption in the 
state's acupuncture licensing system. Some practitioners have welcomed the 
scrutiny, hoping it will root out what one law enforcement official called a 
"cancer" in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner said it was possible that the arrests represented just 
"the tip of the iceberg." There have long been suspicions of corruption in the 
state examination and licensing system, according to acupuncturists and 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"They want these unqualified people out," said Herbert Lapin, a deputy district 
attorney prosecuting the case. "Because if they do something wrong, it affects 
the entire acupuncture community, so that people will not go to them." 
</P>
<P>
According to Lapin, the alleged bribery scheme centered on Chae Woo Lew, who is 
believed to have accepted bribes ranging from $1,500 to $27,000 in return for 
divulging state exam answers during his two terms on the state's Acupuncture 
Examination Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Lew, who was arrested Jan. 21, allegedly worked through middlemen. Through 
them, aspiring acupuncturists who were unable to pass the exams obtained from 
Lew a special code that revealed the correct test answers, according to Lapin. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they believe that the acupuncturists arrested Friday 
represent only a fraction of all the unqualified practitioners who may have 
become licensed with Lew's alleged assistance. The amount of money involved may 
well have reached millions of dollars, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the length of time and potential amount of money involved, this is 
the largest single case of corruption that has come to light that I can 
remember," Reiner said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
It could not be determined whether acupuncture patients had suffered as a 
result of poor treatment from unqualified practitioners. Hundreds of thousands 
of Southern Californians are believed to frequent acupuncturists for treatment 
of everything from pain to infertility. 
</P>
<P>
One of the risks would be infection from unsterilized needles, medical experts 
said. For example, hepatitis has been known to be transmitted through 
acupuncture needles. French doctors recently reported a case involving the 
transmission of the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the investigation and arrests has been mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the acupuncture examination committee, which has licensed 3,000 
acupuncturists, declined to comment Friday on the case. They said they could 
not predict whether the committee might consider revoking licenses as a result 
of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter Eckman, a committee member and San Francisco physician who is a close 
friend of Lew, said the committee will wait for the outcome of the prosecution 
of Lew and the arrested acupuncturists. He called the accusations "vague" but 
added, "Either way, it's not good for the profession." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Kim, president of Royal University, an acupuncture academy in Koreatown 
where, according to the district attorney's office, a former dean and several 
former students have been implicated in the investigation, insisted that his 
school has not been involved and is not affected by the district attorney's 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Closed Minds' 
</P>
<P>
"The people who hate acupuncture and who have always hated acupuncture will 
have closed minds and say, 'I always told you those guys were no good,' " said 
Dr. Ronald Katz, chairman of the department of anesthesiology at the UCLA 
School of Medicine, who has practiced acupuncture himself. "And the people who 
believe in acupuncture will say, 'Well, there goes the Establishment again 
trying to stamp out anything that's not traditional.' " 
</P>
<P>
Acupuncture, in which long needles are passed through the skin, stimulating the 
nervous system, has been used in Asia for centuries. It became popular in the 
West during the 1970s. California was one of the first states to permit its 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
Under laws passed by the California Legislature during the mid-1970s, 
acupuncture education and practice are overseen by the examination committee, 
an 11-member board appointed by the governor and Assembly Speaker and made up 
of physicians, acupuncturists and lay people. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, under the Department of Consumer Affairs, has licensed about 15 
training programs in California. Acupuncturists must undergo four years of 
training or receive an equivalent education elsewhere in order to sit for the 
state exams. 
</P>
<P>
The exams cover 13 major subjects, ranging from anatomy and physiology to the 
use of herbs, diet and nutrition. At a committee hearing in Los Angeles last 
month, angry acupuncturists attacked the exams as subjective and the committee 
as aloof, politicized and secretive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a crap shoot and everybody knows it," said Neil Miller, who failed the 
exam last May but is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview recently, Miller mused, "Do you think this test protects the 
public from acupuncturists who are not qualified? No way." 
</P>
<P>
Committee member Lew, a native Korean and resident of Hillsborough, Calif., is 
viewed by some as having played a pivotal role in developing acupuncture in the 
United States. He was appointed to the committee in 1981. According to Lapin, 
Lew authored and judged all the exams administered in Korean. 
</P>
<P>
Lapin declined to say whether other committee officials are under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
However, Joel Edelman, a member of the committee, has called for a state 
attorney general's investigation into the board's past practices. In a recent 
interview, Edelman accused other committee officials of trying to gloss over 
Lew's alleged misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
"Their attitude is nothing is wrong; Chae Lew was acting on his own," said 
Edelman, a mediation lawyer in Santa Monica. "His actions didn't affect us." 
</P>
<P>
According to Lapin, the probe intensified last August in response to reports of 
an extortion attempt in the Korean community. That incident later proved to be 
an effort by community members to compel Lew to pay for the education of the 
unqualified acupuncturists, and no charges were filed, Lapin said. 
</P>
<P>
Several people familiar with Lew agreed to work with the district attorney's 
office as informants, Lapin said. Wearing electronic listening devices, they 
collected evidence that Lapin said will prove in court that Lew repeatedly 
accepted the bribes. 
</P>
<P>
"No one, or maybe one or two people, ever dealt directly with Lew," Lapin said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Lapin said, they paid one of several intermediaries who would then 
travel to the San Francisco area and give Lew the money. 
</P>
<P>
The students, who Lapin said were not qualified to sit for the state exam, 
would then travel with the intermediary to San Francisco and meet with Lew. He 
said Lew would explain a system whereby key letters in exam questions would 
indicate the correct multiple-choice answers. 
</P>
<P>
As an illustration, Lapin offered this hypothetical example: "If the first word 
in the question was 'The,' then the answer would be 'A.' If the last word of 
the question ended with '-ful,' maybe the answer would be 'B.' 
</P>
<P>
"They were also told not to answer all the questions correctly, just get 
slightly over 70%, so that nobody would suspect what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
The passing grade for the exam is 70%. 
</P>
<P>
As for the practical exam, Lew allegedly told candidates to simply underline a 
certain word on the first page. That marking served as a signal to Lew, who was 
judging the exams, that the candidate had paid up, Lapin said. 
</P>
<P>
Lapin said he believes that the Korean test is no longer in use as a result of 
an experiment conducted by his office: An investigator took the test last 
summer and answered nearly every question correctly, persuading state officials 
"that we were onto something." 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Diamond, the committee's executive director, said in an interview last 
month that Lew had no role in designing the current test. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the exam is good," he said. "There will be no changes." 
</P>
<P>
The acupuncturists targeted in Friday's raid included 21 from downtown Los 
Angeles, eight from Orange County, six from eastern Los Angeles county and 
others from the South Bay, the Westside and the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Lew is scheduled to be arraigned on April 7 on 54 counts of bribery and one 
count of conspiracy to bribe.

'WE HAD A NUMBER OF EMERGENCIES'; 
</P>
<P>
PILOT OF CRIPPLED JETLINER HAD DOUBTS OF SAFE RETURN 
</P>

The pilot of United Airlines' Flight 811 admitted Friday that he "had a few 
doubts" whether his jumbo jetliner -- crippled by a gaping hole ripped in the 
fuselage and two of its four engines dead -- was going to make it back to 
Honolulu last week. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. David Cronin told reporters that the cockpit crew's initial calculations 
showed that the Boeing 747 might have been losing altitude too fast to reach 
the airport before plunging into the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Cronin said the 10-by-20-foot section of fuselage blew out in "a tremendous 
explosion" as the plane climbed out of Honolulu on Feb. 24 at between 22,000 
and 23,000 feet. The cause of the blast, which swept nine passengers to their 
deaths and injured 27 others, has not been determined. Structural failure, 
rather than a bomb, is suspected. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a number of emergencies, not just one," Cronin said as the Los 
Angeles-based cockpit crew members made their first public appearance at San 
Francisco International Airport on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We had explosive decompression," he said. "That's an emergency in itself. Next 
we had No. 3 engine fail. That's also an emergency in itself. Next we had a 
fire in No. 4 engine. That's another emergency in itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Next we had to dump fuel . . . in order to stay airborne," he said. "Handling 
the aircraft in the situation we had was very difficult. . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Bit of Concern' 
</P>
<P>
"All these things . . . generated a bit of concern." 
</P>
<P>
Cronin -- who remained at the controls throughout the flight -- said he sent 
the second officer, Mark Thomas, 46, below to check the damage in the passenger 
cabin. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got downstairs (and saw the hole), I knew we had a serious problem," 
Thomas said. "It was like looking outside through a picture window." 
</P>
<P>
Cronin said the look on Thomas' face when he returned told everything about the 
situation below. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have to say a word," the captain said. "I said a prayer for (the 
passengers), and got back to business." 
</P>
<P>
Cronin, a 59-year-old who has flown for 38 years as an Air Force and commercial 
pilot, said he and his crew members elected to rely on their experience, rather 
than the book, to bring the big plane home. 
</P>
<P>
According to the book, he said, a pilot faced with sudden decompression is 
supposed to lower the landing gear immediately to create drag, dropping rapidly 
to lower altitudes, where both passengers and crew will be able to breathe more 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
But Cronin said that despite the fact that the cockpit's emergency oxygen masks 
failed to deploy properly, none of the crew members seemed to be having 
breathing difficulties. And every foot of altitude was needed to bring the big 
plane back to Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
So, for the time being, he left the gear up, the captain said. "I calculated 
this risk was necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, it did not seem to make much difference. 
</P>
<P>
Al Slader, the 48-year-old co-pilot, said that as he watched the altimeter, the 
big plane continued to drop, first below 15,000 feet, then below 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We found we were unable to hold altitude, even with the No. 1 and No. 2 
engines at full power," Slader said. "I remember Dave asking Mark, 'What's the 
maximum thrust we can get out of those engines?' And Mark replied, 'Whatever it 
takes.' 
</P>
<P>
"I kept looking at the distance measuring equipment, trying to figure out the 
rate of descent we had . . . whether we were, in fact, going to make it back to 
Honolulu. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, as the plane started to reach the denser air at lower altitudes, the 
rate of descent began to slow, and Cronin said his decision to keep the gear up 
was vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
"We broke through the clouds at 4,000 feet," the captain said. "The rate of 
descent slowed to 50 feet per minute, and we were only 17 miles out . . . I 
could see the airport. . . . I was confident we were going to make it. . . . If 
we'd lowered the gear earlier, we wouldn't have had that altitude." 
</P>
<P>
But that did not mean they were home safe, yet. 
</P>
<P>
The big plane, hampered by the loss of two engines and the drag created by the 
gaping hole on the right side, was still hard for the pilot to control. 
</P>
<P>
And Cronin suspected that the plane's right-hand flaps and slats -- slabs of 
metal that extend from the trailing and leading edges of the wings to provide 
the increased lift necessary for normal takeoffs and landings -- might have 
been damaged by debris from the ruptured fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
The book calls for a 20-degree extension when attempting a landing with two 
engines out, but when the crew members tried a 5-degree extension, they noticed 
that the slats on the right side were stuck at 3 degrees, creating an uneven 
trim that added to the difficulty of controlling the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the crew members' experience took precedent. They elected for a 
compromise between asymmetry and lift -- a compromise that required 
considerable effort by the pilot to keep the big plane steady. 
</P>
<P>
"Al suggested 10 degrees," Cronin said. "We went to 10. It worked fine." 
</P>
<P>
As the jumbo jet lined up for final approach, Cronin finally lowered the gear, 
knowing that with two engines out, that meant a critical increase in drag that 
precluded any opportunity to abort the landing. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't going to be any second chance," Cronin said. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds later, the big plane touched down in what Slader described as "as 
smooth a landing as I've ever sat through." 
</P>
<P>
Within a few minutes, the passengers and crew had been evacuated by emergency 
chutes. 
</P>
<P>
Cronin, who has just one flight left -- a final trip to Australia -- before he 
reaches the mandatory retirement age of 60, then walked around the plane to 
survey the damage. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw that tremendous hole," he said. "I saw how the blades on that engine 
were all chewed up. 
</P>
<P>
"My reaction was, I can't tell you what my reaction was, like, 'Oh, (pause) you 
know what. Oh, dear.' . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I was very thankful we'd made it."

WORKERS STRIKE EASTERN; WIDER DISRUPTION SEEN

<P>
Union machinists at Eastern Airlines early today launched a strike that 
government officials feared could spread across the transportation system, 
disrupting air and rail travel nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, President Bush had refused to intervene in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
In Miami, several hundred striking machinists "charged" one of the gates to 
Eastern's headquarters just after the strike began, throwing rocks and bottles, 
but were repelled by Miami police, according to an Eastern spokeswoman. There 
were no immediate reports of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Across the nation, machinists -- who had been asked by the airline to take pay 
cuts -- immediately formed picket lines at Eastern's airport ticket counters, 
and threatened to spread their protests to other airlines and railroads. 
</P>
<P>
"Eastern Airlines is officially on strike," chief union negotiator Charles E. 
Bryan told reporters as he emerged from a marathon day of negotiations. "As of 
midnight, it's shut down." 
</P>
<P>
The strike began only half an hour after Eastern made a last-ditch proposal to 
the machinists union slightly improving the terms. 
</P>
<P>
"This is good-faith show here," said Joe Leonard, chief operating officer of 
Eastern. "We are trying to put our best proposal forward within the last half 
hour." 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials watched warily for signs that pilots, flight attendants, and 
other workers at other carriers might mount their own boycotts in sympathy for 
the Eastern action as they have threatened, snarling the nation's 
transportation network. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, vowing not to let labor unions 
"hold the economy hostage," said that if the strike became widespread the 
Administration would seek emergency action "to ensure that this country never 
faces such a peril again. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not stand idly by while the grievances of a few jeopardize the 
continued safe and efficient transportation of all," Skinner declared at a 
press conference here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Airport Slowdown 
</P>
<P>
In a related action, the Associated Press reported, the Airline Pilots Assn. 
announced that starting next Tuesday, its 40,000 members would begin to follow 
flying procedures precisely, causing a slowdown in airport procedures. 
</P>
<P>
At Los Angeles International Airport Friday, about 60 pickets appeared in front 
of the Eastern Airlines terminal at 9:15 p.m. Some carried pre-printed posters 
saying that the machinists were striking the airline. Others carried 
hand-written posters saying simply "IAM" -- indicating the International Assn. 
of Machinists. The long-threatened strike by 8,500 Eastern machinists -- who 
include mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground personnel -- began when a 
60-day cooling-off period calling for mandatory federal mediation expired. 
</P>
<P>
In the waning hours of talks, the nation's eighth-largest airline, which is 
losing $1.5 million a day, offered significantly to reduce the wage takebacks 
it has sought from its machinist workers, according to Eastern officials. But 
the union, which originally sought $50 million in raises, maintained its 
refusal to accept cuts. 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for a strike, Eastern announced Friday night that it would slash 
weekend schedules by 75%, eliminating service to 57 cities. It vowed to 
continue service to 50 other cities despite pledges by unions representing 
Eastern's pilots and flight attendants not to cross the machinists' picket 
line. 
</P>
<P>
To safeguard passenger safety, Skinner pledged that the Federal Aviation 
Administration would step up its surveillance of the airline's operations to 
prevent vandalism or sabotage and to ensure that "Eastern's service will be on 
planes that are airworthy and safe." 
</P>
<P>
But the effects of the strike appeared likely to spread to other airlines as 
well, as the 40,000 member Air Line Pilots Assn. asked its member pilots to 
honor the machinists' picket lines. Earlier, Lane Kirkland, president of the 
1.1-million-member AFL-CIO, had urged other transportation workers to act in 
solidarity with the striking machinists. 
</P>
<P>
William R. Robertson, executive secretary of the Los Angles County Federation 
of Labor, said that such secondary boycotts in the airline industry would be 
unprecedented, although similar tactics have been used in past rail labor 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
After declaring that the Eastern strike was on, machinists union negotiators 
refused to discuss their plans for seeking secondary boycotts. The officials 
said the union's strategy would be announced at a briefing here early today. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, President Bush strongly urged "responsible labor leaders" not 
to join in the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
"Such boycotts would unfairly burden millions of citizens, not only preventing 
necessary travel but also affecting shipments of consumer goods and the ability 
of many workers to earn a living," he said in the statement read by White House 
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
In declining to use presidential authority to order a 60-day cooling-off 
period, Bush became the first President to refuse a request by federal 
mediators for action that would forestall an airline strike. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner said presidential intervention "would totally destroy the collective 
bargaining process in this country" and would serve only to postpone a strike 
that most regarded as inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
But the decision was widely criticized by the union leaders and politicians who 
had asked Bush to heed the request of National Mediation Board Chairman Walter 
Wallace and appoint a Presidential Emergency Board in order to avert the 
potentially crippling strike for 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
"We now face the possibility of a commerce-threatening disruption of our 
national transportation system . . . " said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), 
who with 33 other senators had urged action to postpone the strike. "The wisest 
course is to prevent a crisis rather than try to pick up the pieces after it 
has happened." 
</P>
<P>
William W. Winpisinger, present of the International Assn. of Machinists and 
Aerospace Workers, said the Bush decision "sends a signal to the traveling 
public and to employers alike that government will play no role in such a 
critical situation in which the public as well as the employees are victims." 
</P>
<P>
"It seems a shame that the President who pledged a 'kinder and gentler nation' 
during the campaign would not manifest that spirit now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect that the Eastern strike would affect other airlines and railroads 
across the country results from provisions of the Railway Labor Act, which 
exempts certain transportation workers from laws prohibiting striking workers 
from setting up picket lines in front of other workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration denounced that exemption in announcing its decision to let 
the Eastern strike proceed, contending that there was "no legitimate reason for 
treating the railroads and airlines any differently." 
</P>
<P>
Saying that a strike by Eastern alone would not "deprive any section of the 
country" of essential services, Skinner declared: "It is only by way of 
secondary boycotts, across all modes of transportation, that the traveling 
public and this nation's economy will face the prospect of inconvenience or 
grave harm." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern, owned by Texas Air Corp., flies 100,000 passengers a day and has a 
market share of 6% of the industry's revenue passenger miles. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Eastern passengers reported difficulties after the airline, 
concerned about the prospect of worker sabotage, won permission from a federal 
judge in Miami to send machinists home on a paid holiday and enlisted 
supervisors to work in their place. In Washington, Miami and other cities, 
machinists staged demonstrations that slowed airport traffic and caused some 
commuters to miss their flights. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers arriving at Washington's National Airport struggled to make 
connections despite late flights and missing baggage, while those trying to 
leave waited in unusually long ticket lines. 
</P>
<P>
An afternoon flight from Miami arrived almost three hours late after sitting on 
the runway in Florida. Ruth St. Orge, who was on the flight, said: "They just 
couldn't find anybody to put the bags on the plane." 
</P>
<P>
The intense animosity between labor and management at Eastern dates from early 
1986, when the company was taken over by Texas Air Corp., headed by Frank 
Lorenzo, regarded even then as the archenemy of labor. 
</P>
<P>
Blaming the airline's financial troubles on high labor costs, Lorenzo sought 
union agreements for sharp wage cuts, prompting union officials to charge that 
he was seeking to break up the union altogether. 
</P>
<P>
The airline, which has had only one profitable year since deregulation began a 
decade ago, continues to reel from financial trouble. It posted a record loss 
last year of $335.4 million, nearly double the $181.7-million loss of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Independent analysts believe that the airline's problems are so severe that a 
lengthy strike could drive it into bankruptcy. "In terms of cash flow, it is my 
belief that Eastern will be able to survive a strike of 30 days or less," said 
Paul Karos, airline analyst with First Boston Corp., a New York stock 
brokerage.

The airline: Eastern, headquartered in Miami, is owned by Houston-based Texas 
Air Corp., whose other primary subsidiary is Continental Airlines. Eastern has 
a fleet of 250 jets. The company typically has 1,040 flights daily, carrying 
about 100,000 passengers, to 118 cities. 
</P>
<P>
The union: Eastern's 8,500 mechanics and other ground personnel are represented 
by the International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. 
</P>
<P>
THE CHIEF ISSUE: 
</P>
<P>
Eastern has lost more than $500 million in the last two years and more than a 
billion dollars in the last decade. The company contends that much of its 
losses are a result of high labor costs. When Texas Air Corp. bought Eastern 
three years ago, the company's pilots and flight attendants agreed to 20% pay 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern is now seeking $125 million in wage concessions in a new 5-year 
contract, including cuts of up to 28% from the machinists. Mechanics currently 
averaging $18.83 per hour would have their pay cut to either $14, $16, or $18 
depending on their skill level or the union could accept an across-the-board 
rate of $16. Baggage handlers who now make $15.60 an hour would be cut to 
$11.54 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The machinists, saying they have already given millions back to the company in 
prior years in the form of wage and work rule concessions, are asking for an 
immediate wage freeze but a total increase of 8% over the life of the contract.

TIME, WARNER REPORTEDLY ON VERGE OF MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Warner Communications Inc. and Time Inc., two of the world's most powerful 
entertainment and media companies, are on the verge of announcing a merger that 
would create a titan worth nearly $15 billion, industry sources said late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Time-Warner is a done deal," declared one entertainment industry executive, 
while an investment banking source added: "There is a very, very high degree of 
probability that it's done." The banker cautioned, however, that in the past, 
Time executives have had "difficulty closing a transaction. Of (all) I've ever 
seen, they're the worst." 
</P>
<P>
No Warner or Time official could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Both Time and Warner have fretted about controlling their destinies during the 
frenzied takeover battles of the 1980s. Last year, the two companies discussed 
the possibility of merging their cable television holdings but were unable to 
reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
A combination of the two companies will create a cable company second only to 
Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver, which has rapidly added programming and 
movie theater outlets to its empire of cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
In programming, Time's Home Box Office subsidiary dominates pay television, 
while Warner operates one of the most respected motion picture studios in 
Hollywood. Despite two recent lackluster years at the box office, Warner last 
month snared more Academy Award nominations than any other studio, and it 
continues to enjoy long-running relationships with such stars as Clint Eastwood 
and Goldie Hawn. And while Time was a latecomer to the home videocassette 
business, Warner has profited in the videocassette field by drawing on its 
enviable film library. 
</P>
<P>
In magazine publishing, Time simply has no equal. In addition to its namesake 
Time magazine, the company publishes Life, Sports Illustrated, People, Money, 
Fortune and Southern Living. It is also a 50% owner of the company that 
publishes McCall's and Working Woman, and a 50% owner of Whittle 
Communications, publisher of business and health periodicals. In addition, Time 
and Warner each have publishing operations. Warner owns DC Comics, Mad Magazine 
and Warner Books. Time owns Time-Life Books, Book-of-the-Month Club, and 
Little, Brown &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
In recorded music, Warner reaps more profits than any other company, including 
CBS Records -- acquired last year by Sony in a highly touted $2-billion deal. 
Warner derives 45% of its total revenue from record labels that include 
Electra, Asylum, Nonesuch, Atlantic and Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
The Time-Warner merger would be accomplished by an exchange of stock, with a 
value of at least $50 assigned to each Warner share, according to one source. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Co-Managers Expected 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the combined company would be managed for the near future by 
co-chief executive officers -- presumably Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross, 61, 
and Time Chairman J. Richard Munro, 58. 
</P>
<P>
The price of both Warner and Time Inc. shares have risen sharply in recent 
days. Warner stock began the week at $41.25 and closed just shy of $46. Time's 
shares jumped above $109 from $104.50 at the start of the week. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a merger between Time and Warner apparently was broached 
last summer when the two companies were engaged in ultimately unsuccessful 
negotiations for a possible combination of their cable and entertainment 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cable Powers 
</P>
<P>
Discussions at the time reportedly centered on combining Warner Cable, with 1.4 
million subscribers, with Time-controlled American Television &amp; 
Communications Inc., with 3.8 million subscribers. The companies also discussed 
including in the venture Time's Home Box Office unit and Warner's movie 
operations, according to published reports at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal met resistance from Time's board, according to a story last 
September in the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
The Journal indicated that one stumbling block was a delay in completion of 
Warner's purchase of Lorimar-Telepictures Corp., a leading supplier of 
television programming such as "Dallas" and "Falcon Crest." However, analysts 
at the time said discussions of a full-fledged combination between Time and 
Warner might resume once the Lorimar acquisition was consummated. The deal was 
completed in January.

TEAMSTERS COUNTER U.S. OFFER IN SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
RACKETEERING CASE PROPOSAL ALLOWS LESS OUTSIDE CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN and RONALD J. OSTROW, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Teamsters Union has made a counteroffer to the government in an attempt to 
settle the massive racketeering suit filed against the union by the Justice 
Department last June, according to knowledgeable sources. 
</P>
<P>
The union's proposal, as might be expected, would give the government 
considerably less control over the union than two Justice Department settlement 
offers that the Teamsters board rejected within the last five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Teamsters proposal is so different from the Justice Department's 
that one East Coast source said: "It's like you're trying to buy a beach house 
and they ask a million dollars and you come back with a counteroffer of 
$100,000." 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Teamsters assert in their proposal that the union has never 
been under the influence of the Mafia or any other criminal group. The 
government proposals would require the union to acknowledge that "there have 
been past problems with La Cosa Nostra corruption of various elements of the 
IBT (International Brotherhood of Teamsters)." 
</P>
<P>
The union's proposal does state, however, that it is the policy of the 
Teamsters and its officers not to knowingly involve any criminal group in the 
affairs of the union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Resignations 
</P>
<P>
Another major difference is that no current members of the union's executive 
board would be required to resign under the Teamsters proposal. Four members of 
the board -- vice presidents Joseph Trerotola of New York; Joseph Morga of 
Hallandale, Fla.; Donald Peters of Chicago, and Theodore R. Cozza of Pittsburgh 
-- would be required to resign under the Justice Department proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The union's proposal was presented to the government Thursday by five Teamsters 
lawyers, including the union's general counsel James T. Grady, according to 
knowledgeable sources. 
</P>
<P>
Grady declined to return calls Friday. Randy M. Mastro, the assistant U.S. 
attorney in charge of the racketeering suit, said he would not acknowledge 
having received the Teamsters offer. He said simply, "the government is 
preparing for trial." 
</P>
<P>
A trial in the government's case is scheduled to begin in U.S. District Court 
in New York on March 13. The civil suit, filed under the Racketeer-Influenced 
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), charged that the union is heavily 
influenced by organized crime and is no longer responsibly serving the 
interests of its membership. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, the first such action filed against an international union in U.S. 
history, asks U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein to oust the Teamsters top 
management, place the union under court trusteeship and bar certain alleged 
Mafia figures from any contact with the union or its officers. The Teamsters 
have decried the suit as an unconstitutional attack on freedom of association. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Teamsters proposal, the government could install an "observer," 
jointly chosen by the Justice Department and the union executive board, in the 
union headquarters until its convention 2 1/2 years from now. The observer 
would be paid by the Teamsters. 
</P>
<P>
The observer would have the power to attend Teamsters board meetings, have 
access to union documents and records, make written recommendations to the 
board on alleged incidents of corruption and have a paid staff. The authority 
of the monitor would cease after the union's 1991 convention. 
</P>
<P>
The government proposed having three administrators installed at the union, 
with considerably more power, including the right to discipline officers or 
employees, institute trusteeships over local unions and veto any expenditure of 
the national union's funds or the transfer of any of its property. The 
administrators would be in power through the union's 1996 convention and the 
Labor Department would supervise all Teamsters national elections through 2011. 
</P>
<P>
The Teamsters proposal also calls for the creation of a review board of three 
persons that would have the authority to hold hearings and implement solutions 
on alleged corruption in the union. The review board would be composed of one 
member appointed by the union, one by the government and one mutually. The 
board would operate at least until the union's 1991 convention and its work 
would continue beyond that time if delegates at that convention voted to keep 
it operating. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prospect of Reform 
</P>
<P>
The union's offer holds out the prospect of reforming Teamsters election 
procedures, but the proposed changes would have to be approved by delegates to 
the union's 1991 convention. If the delegates approved suggested changes to the 
union's constitution, there would be a direct referendum election of the 
union's top two officers by secret ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The government's proposal also calls for direct secret ballot election of the 
union's two top officers and also calls for the union's vice presidents to be 
chosen by secret ballot at the convention. There would be no change in how 
union vice presidents are chosen under the union proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the two top officers, president and secretary-treasurer, as well as 
16 union vice presidents, are chosen by majority vote of delegates raising 
their hands at the union convention, which is held once every five years. The 
method of selecting delegates to the convention would also be changed under 
both proposals. 
</P>
<P>
One source close to the Teamsters said the union's proposal was based, in part, 
on federal court decrees that that had been entered in RICO cases brought 
against local unions in New York.

VENEZUELA RIOTS NOT POLITICAL, PEREZ SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
PRESIDENT BLAMES UNREST ON FOREIGN DEBT, CONFIRMS 300 KILLED 
</P>

CARACAS, Venezuela 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Carlos Andres Perez on Friday characterized the bloody price riots 
that took more than 300 lives in this once tranquil and wealthy nation as a 
largely spontaneous and nonpolitical outburst of the poor against the rich. 
</P>
<P>
He blamed Venezuela's foreign-debt crisis for creating the conditions that 
sparked the violence. 
</P>
<P>
"It did not have the political overtones of a protest against the government or 
against political parties," said the president, who only the day before had 
implied that leftist revolutionaries were at least partly responsible. "It was 
an action against wealth, against the rich." 
</P>
<P>
But without naming such major creditor countries as the United States, he 
blamed them for not doing their share to ease the country's $33-billion debt 
burden and the resulting hardships that, he said, brought about the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"The disturbances are a consequence of the deterioration of the economy due to 
a crisis whose name I write in capital letters -- foreign debt," Perez told a 
press conference in Caracas at which he confirmed the death toll. 
</P>
<P>
He said he warned then-Vice President George Bush last September that democracy 
in Latin American countries was in peril unless something was done soon to 
soften debt repayment terms. 
</P>
<P>
"(The year) 1989 will be the year of new definitions in the treatment of 
foreign debt, or it will be the year of the destruction of the democratic 
process in Latin America," Perez told the press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Confusion over some of the president's remarks at the press conference caused a 
flurry of concern in international financial markets when news agencies 
reported that Perez said Venezuela was suspending all payments on its foreign 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
Venezuela suspended principal payments on most of its $27-billion public-sector 
foreign debt Jan. 17, and last Sunday, Central Bank President Pedro Tinoco said 
principal payments would also be suspended as of March 1 on the country's 
$6-billion private-sector debt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflicting Statements 
</P>
<P>
In response to reporters' questions Friday, Perez seemed to indicate at one 
stage that the country had also suspended interest payments on the foreign 
debt, but this was later denied in Caracas and by the nation's chief debt 
negotiator in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The government's imposition last weekend of tough austerity measures, including 
sharp price increases on gasoline, transportation and basic food items, sent 
thousands into the streets in a wave of looting; the economic damage still has 
not been totaled. The austerity package, shaped in response to the debt crisis, 
was demanded by the International Monetary Fund as the price of a credit 
package totaling nearly $5 billion over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
Perez suspended civil rights and called out 22,000 troops and police, who were 
still searching out snipers and running house-to-house searches for looted 
goods five days later. But with the disturbances all but ended, the government 
eased dawn-to-dusk curfew hours Friday, reducing them from 12 hours to the nine 
hours between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan president predicted that as a result of the disturbances, "the 
country will live through about six months of serious difficulties, but then 
there will be a period of expansion." He stressed that he will stick to the 
IMF-imposed austerity plan, which he said "is indispensable in its entirety if 
we want to establish a solid base for our economic development." 
</P>
<P>
Later Friday in Washington, officials said the Bush Administration is preparing 
to offer Venezuela a $450-million temporary "bridge loan" to tide the country 
over until it gets the expected larger, longer-term loan from the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
The new line of credit, which officials said may be backed in part by several 
other countries as well, is expected to be announced publicly in Venezuela over 
the weekend or early next week. 
</P>
<P>
The "bridge loan" would be repaid as soon as Venezuela can draw on the IMF 
money, probably in mid- or late April. 
</P>
<P>
As life throughout the nation and in all but three small slum areas of the 
capital city returned to near normal Friday, Perez's poor-versus-rich 
characterization of the price riots struck a sensitive chord among social 
scientists and foreign economic specialists, who criticized many upper and 
upper-middle class Venezuelans for flaunting their wealth. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been living in a fool's paradise," said a foreign economist. "Now they 
must pay the price of being the highest per capita consumers of . . . Scotch 
(whiskey) in the world." Whiskey, along with new automobiles at half the U.S. 
price and many other luxury goods, receive the same preferential import 
treatment as medicines which, in effect, produces a state subsidy on luxury 
items that mainly benefits the well-to-do. 
</P>
<P>
"The elite have not lived up to the economic realities," said Jose Gil Yepes, a 
Caracas political economist, sharply criticizing the conspicuous spending of 
some. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Champagne for Some 
</P>
<P>
Gil particularly cited a million-dollar wedding party two weeks ago that was 
billed on the front page and on nine inside pages of the local newspaper, 
Diario de Caracas, as "The Wedding of the Century." The newspaper reported that 
5,000 guests, including hundreds flown at the host's expense from as far away 
as Tahiti, Italy and the United States, consumed thousands of bottles of 
vintage French Champagne and ate from "a buffet overflowing with caviar, 
lobster and salmon." 
</P>
<P>
The wedding of Gonzalo Fernandez Tinoco y Zingg and Mariela Cisneros Fontanals 
united two of the country's richest families. The family of the bride's father, 
Oswaldo Cisneros, has huge holdings, including the principal soft-drink 
franchise here, a television network and a chain of supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether this event helped pave the way for the riots no one can say, but like 
a lot of things that rich Venezuelans do, it was obscenely ostentatious," said 
a foreign economic specialist. 
</P>
<P>
"Even ordinary middle-class people here like to say that every Venezuelan has a 
right to two cars, and this sort of talk is bound to make poor people angry." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
40% Below Poverty Line 
</P>
<P>
Economists and social scientists estimate that 40% to 50% of Caracas' 
3.7-million people live below the official poverty line of 5,000 bolivars 
(about $143) per family per month. 
</P>
<P>
As the economic situation worsens, the plight of the poor can only grow worse, 
said one of several economic specialists who are predicting 100% inflation in 
Venezuela this year. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past five to 10 years since oil prices turned down, Venezuelans have 
refused to believe they are no longer the wealthy country they were during the 
oil boom," said a foreign specialist. "With prices of 15 cents for a gallon of 
gasoline and cars at half the U.S. price, who's going to pay the difference? 
The treasury of Venezuela, which translates into the man in the street and he's 
mad as hell about it. 
</P>
<P>
"They've postponed biting the bullet so long that it's no longer a bullet -- 
it's a bomb."

The Kenyan government said Friday that its security forces killed 72 of about 
400 cattle rustlers who raided its territory from neighboring Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
In a protest note handed to Uganda's acting ambassador in Nairobi, the 
government demanded an explanation for the raid, which it said was carried out 
by heavily armed men. 
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the raiders, some wearing military 
uniforms, were discovered Thursday by a Kenyan security force. Two Kenyan 
security officers were killed and a resident was injured in the gun battle near 
Pokot, a small village in northwestern Kenya, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Pokot tribe, on the Kenyan side of the border, and the Karamonjong, on 
the Ugandan side, have traditionally raided each other.

A high-level task force created by the United States and the European Community 
in an attempt to settle a "hormone meat" dispute will meet for the first time 
Monday, the government announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Along with announcing the date for the meeting, the Bush Administration said 
its team will be led by Joshua Bolton, acting deputy trade ambassador. The 
European Community has named a five-member team. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has strained transatlantic relations and led to imposition of $100 
million in high U.S. tariffs on seven European products to offset the loss of 
meat sales. The European Community bars the sale of meat produced with growth 
hormones.

Japan will not fund construction of the final segment of a controversial 
highway through the Amazon rain forest in Brazil, according to a senior 
Republican senator. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bob Kasten of Wisconsin said Japan's ambassador to the United States, 
Nobuo Matsunaga, "assured me the Japanese are not considering any proposal to 
fund this highway." 
</P>
<P>
Many environmentalists oppose the project, known as BR-364, because they fear 
it will hurt the rain forest. It would link remote regions of the jungle in 
Peru and Brazil to bustling Pacific ports on the other side of the Andes, 
permitting raw materials such as lumber from the forest to be easily shipped 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Pressure Cited 
</P>
<P>
Kasten said he believes that pressure from the United States helped persuade 
Japan not to fund the road. 
</P>
<P>
"I assured them that we will watch this project very closely because we intend 
to ensure that basic environmental safeguards are followed if an arrangement 
between the Brazilians and the Japanese develops," Kasten added in a statement 
released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Kasten is senior Republican on the Foreign Operations subcommittee, which has 
jurisdiction over U.S. funds to multilateral development banks. He said Japan, 
as a leading source of development funds, has a responsibility to make sure 
that projects are environmentally safe. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 3, a team of senators pledged to try to block the jungle road after 
spotting evidence of it while touring the Amazon basin. They said construction 
equipment was already in place, awaiting the end of the rainy season in April.

The huge Amazon rain forest is regarded as vital to the global environment. 
Scientists have warned that its destruction could deprive the world of an 
important source of oxygen and alter its weather patterns. Plants release 
oxygen during photosynthesis.

Embattled novelist Salman Rushdie expressed fear Friday that British support 
for him and "The Satanic Verses" is waning, and Muslims offended by his novel 
staged protests in several countries that left one person dead and dozens 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
The Indian-born British writer, in a call to the office of opposition 
legislator Paddy Ashdown, said he believes the British government "is beginning 
to play both ends against the middle," said a spokeswoman for Ashdown who took 
the call. 
</P>
<P>
Harriet Smith, the spokeswoman for Ashdown, said Rushdie "expressed concern" 
about conciliatory remarks by Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe. 
</P>
<P>
The comment by the 41-year-old Rushdie, who disappeared from public after the 
Iranian leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, sentenced him to death Feb. 
14, came a day after Howe acknowledged that "The Satanic Verses" is offensive 
to Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
Britain had led a diplomatic campaign against Iran after the death threat, and 
the Foreign Office on Friday denied any weakening in Howe's position, saying 
that the government continues to support Rushdie's right to free expression. 
</P>
<P>
But Iran's President Ali Khamenei dismissed Howe's statement as "playing with 
words."

Lung Thanh Thuy is a pretty 21-year-old with an engaging smile, and to this day 
she is wondering what made her climb into a rickety fishing boat and head 
across the South China Sea to Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Thuy, one of 75 Vietnamese "boat people" who returned voluntarily to Hanoi on 
Thursday under a program sponsored by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR), said in an interview: 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly don't know why I did it. I was with a group of six friends, and one 
night they said they were going. I just decided to follow. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I got to Hong Kong I realized I made a mistake. I asked right away 
to go back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Want Others to Return 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Vietnam, Hong Kong and other Asian countries are hoping that 
thousands of other Vietnamese "boat people" will do what Thuy did and choose to 
return to their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Thuy faced a bleak future in Hong Kong. She arrived after a major change in 
government policy last June 16, and because she could not prove that she was a 
genuine refugee under U.N. criteria, she was tagged an illegal immigrant and 
held in a detention center pending repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with that, she said, she decided to return voluntarily under a plan 
agreed to last year by Hong Kong, Britain, Vietnam and the UNHCR. The first 
group of returnees was flown from Hong Kong to Hanoi in a chartered airliner 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has agreed not to punish those who return as long as they behave, a 
move seen by officials involved in the program as the key to its success. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Illusions on Treatment 
</P>
<P>
Thuy said she was under no illusions as to what could have happened on her 
return. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting next to the boyfriend she met in the Hong Kong camp, she grinned and 
said, "I thought to myself if the government is generous when I return then 
I'll be grateful. But if I was to be punished, well, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
A lively woman who said she loves movies and dancing, Thuy will be reunited 
with her family Monday after medical checks in a holding center near Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
But if teen-agers and young people like Thuy are looking forward to being able 
to resume their lives, others who were interviewed were less than happy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fearful of Meeting Family 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Thi Tuan, 43, the mother of three, managed the family restaurant in 
Hanoi until her abrupt decision to flee by boat in hopes of reaching the United 
States by way of Hong Kong. She was plainly terrified of meeting her family 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the interview she twisted her hands nervously and several times 
dabbed her tear-filled eyes. 
</P>
<P>
She said she had had an argument with her husband, their first in 19 years of 
marriage, and had fled with some friends. As they reached the departure point, 
she tried to back out, she said, but the others forced her to go. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose I felt that, as I can cook very well, I could go to the United 
States, set myself up and sponsor my children. But of course it couldn't work 
out like that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Had to Come Back' 
</P>
<P>
"I did not dare write to my husband. I was worried he would not forgive me. But 
somebody in the camp in Hong Kong saw me crying all the time and wrote to my 
husband. He sent me back an eight-page letter. I had to come back for that and 
my children," she added. 
</P>
<P>
But she said she is still unsure how her husband will react. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very nervous. My hands won't stop trembling. This is all my fault, nobody 
else's." 
</P>
<P>
All those interviewed Friday said they prefer to live in Vietnam, although they 
were clearly uneasy at times when asked why they had left in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Officials involved in the repatriation program said there had been a strange 
sort of mood in northern Vietnam last summer, with many people talking of 
leaving to make a better life. They said most left without weighing 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Several of those who returned said they had heard of changes in Hong Kong's 
policy only at third- or fourth-hand and were still not clear what it involves.

AFGHAN REBELS FACE NEW PROBLEM -- SEAT FOR INTERIM GOVERNMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
Now that they have formed a government, Afghanistan's fractious moujahedeen 
rebels are faced with the major problem of where to put it. 
</P>
<P>
Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, elected Feb. 23 as president of what the moujahedeen 
call an interim government, said it would be installed in Afghanistan within a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Moujahedeen officials and Western diplomats say it is important that the 
promise be honored, but choosing a seat for a government now based in Peshawar 
in northwestern Pakistan is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been discussing it for a week, but we haven't made much progress," one 
rebel official said. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the government installed inside Afghanistan quickly is important 
politically for the Muslim rebels fighting the Kabul government, now bereft of 
Soviet military support. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, leaders of seven rebel groups based in Peshawar formed a government 
under Muslim fundamentalist Ahmad Shah. 
</P>
<P>
"Ahmad Shah sat in Peshawar and became a joke. Mojaddidi's (government) has to 
demonstrate as soon as possible that it is not Peshawar-bound," one Western 
diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
"Putting it inside will demonstrate that it is an Afghan creation and 
Afghan-run," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Once it's inside, people can't influence it. Afghans will see it as theirs and 
start to rally round it, I think," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Finding a place sufficiently safe from which the interim government can also 
communicate to the outside world is the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The moujahedeen have captured five of 30 provincial capitals. 
</P>
<P>
They are reluctant to launch all-out assaults on other main Afghan cities they 
are besieging, mostly because guerrilla families are still inside them. 
</P>
<P>
The rebel-held cities are either too far from Pakistan to ensure easy 
communications with the outside world, or are vulnerable to government air 
strikes and the Scud missiles Moscow gave Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
Moujahedeen officials say they are under pressure from the Pakistani military, 
eager to keep up the political momentum provided by the election of the 
government, to take an eastern Afghan city as the government seat. 
</P>
<P>
Jalalabad, a three-hour drive east of Kabul, is a possibility, but it has been 
heavily reinforced by Kabul and its flat terrain makes attack difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats said the southern city of Kandahar is likely to fall sooner 
than Jalalabad. But some factions oppose Kandahar, an area that supports former 
King Mohammed Zahir Shah. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said the most logical site is Khost, near the border about 80 miles 
south of Jalalabad.

U.S. REFUGEE POLICY STILL KEEPS OUT 99% OF THE OPPRESSED 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A steadily lengthening line of Soviet Jews and Armenians trying to get into the 
United States has focused attention on a U.S. refugee policy that, despite more 
than a century of open-door rhetoric, is designed to keep out at least 99 of 
every 100 of the world's persecuted and oppressed. 
</P>
<P>
At any one time, there are between 10 million and 13 million refugees in the 
world -- people who have fled their own countries because of political, 
religious or ethnic persecution and who fear imprisonment or death if they are 
forced to return. Of those refugees, only about 100,000 a year have much chance 
of reaching the United States or any other Western country. 
</P>
<P>
"Only 1% of the people we feel are refugees and in need of help will ever be 
resettled," a State Department official said. "Being a refugee does not 
automatically get you into a queue to come to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Almost Automatic Admission 
</P>
<P>
Until a sudden outpouring of Soviet citizens overwhelmed the system late last 
year, being a refugee from Soviet communism did, in practice, allow virtually 
automatic admission to the United States. And Soviet refugees still have a far 
higher chance of coming to this country than do refugees from Central America, 
the Caribbean and parts of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials acknowledge that politics plays a major role in deciding who is 
a refugee. For example, in addition to the special status accorded Soviet 
citizens, people fleeing the Marxist regimes in Vietnam, Poland, Afghanistan 
and Ethiopia also have a very good chance of reaching the United States and 
remaining here. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals from those countries who do not qualify as refugees are normally 
allowed to stay under a program known as "extended voluntary departure," which 
in effect means they can remain until U.S. officials determine that conditions 
in their homelands have improved -- a process that could take many years. 
</P>
<P>
However, because El Salvador has a pro-Western elected government, its citizens 
are normally refused even "extended voluntary departure" status despite a 
festering civil war in which civilians are frequently the targets of both army 
and rebels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Definition of Refugees 
</P>
<P>
Under international law and U.S. statutes, refugees are defined as persons who 
have fled their countries because of well-founded fears of immediate 
persecution that stem from their politics, religion, race or ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
The oppressor, however, must be the government. Those who flee because of 
crime, random violence or endemic poverty and starvation do not qualify. 
</P>
<P>
By this definition, Haitians are normally denied refugee status despite the 
island republic's long tradition of violent and oppressive government, because 
they are thought to be trying to escape poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Salvadorans and most other Central Americans are regularly rejected because the 
danger of death that they face is not considered to be the exclusive fault of 
the government. Nicaraguans, who once enjoyed the special status of escapees 
from communism, have had more trouble recently because they often are classed 
as economic refugees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Legalistic' Distinction 
</P>
<P>
One U.S. official conceded that the sort of danger that produces refugee status 
is no worse than the kind that does not. The distinction is a "legalistic" one, 
he said, but the government has no choice but to apply the law. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone who seeks to enter the country as a refugee is interviewed by the 
federal Immigration and Naturalization Service. It is often a haphazard 
process. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official acknowledged that it is usually impossible to check a person's 
claim of fear of persecution. "The more likely one is to have been persecuted," 
the official said, "the less likely it is that they have documents showing 
that." 
</P>
<P>
The decision whether to grant asylum, the official said, depends on "whether we 
believe what the applicant is telling us rings true with what else we know" 
about the country. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the United States hectored the Soviet Union to let more people go. 
Now, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has permitted such a substantial increase 
in emigration -- most of it among Jews and Armenians -- that the U.S. network 
for handling refugees has been swamped. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a victim of our own success," said Delia B. Combs, an assistant INS 
commissioner. "Now, we are getting people who we have asked for for many, many 
years, and we don't have the money" to process and support them as refugees. 
</P>
<P>
It could be argued that because of Gorbachev's reforms, Soviet Jews no longer 
face the sort of persecution that qualified them for refugee status before 
Gorbachev took over. But the U.S. government has rejected applying such a 
Catch-22 to Soviet Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Before he left office last month, former Secretary of State George P. Shultz 
promised that all Soviet emigres who want to live in the United States would be 
permitted to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the reason I think that the government is so generous right now is 
that we don't want to miss an opportunity to get as many people here as we can 
-- just in case the politics of that country, or indeed any other country, 
might change," Combs said. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish groups, protesting the special parole status, argue that every Soviet 
Jew should be granted refugee status, which entitles them to more public aid 
and makes it easier for them to apply for U.S. citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Central Americans, held in a detention center in south Texas, 
would jump at parole or extended voluntary departure status. Under a new INS 
policy, they face quick deportation if they fail -- as most of them do -- to 
qualify for refugee status. As many as 100,000 Central Americans are expected 
to be denied entry this year. 
</P>
<P>
Only 2,497 Latin Americans were admitted to the United States as refugees 
during the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. That compared with 35,015 from 
Asia, mostly Vietnam; 20,421 from the Soviet Union, and 7,818 from other 
countries of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The discrepancy may be even greater this year. In the first three months of the 
current fiscal year -- October, November and December, 1988 -- only 225 
refugees from Central America were admitted, compared with 6,028 from the 
Soviet Union and 1,826 from Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Soviets began allowing large numbers of people to leave the country, 
INS officials, operating out of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, have worked 
feverishly to keep up with the crush of refugee applicants. INS officials said 
that 4,200 new applicants registered in Moscow in January and that, by the end 
of the month, 16,616 applicants had not been interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say that most of the potential refugees applying at the embassy 
in Moscow are Armenians. Most Jews, they say, leave the Soviet Union with visas 
to enter Israel, but once they reach Europe, about 90% of them seek admission 
to the United States instead. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, U.S. officials are passing out pink forms telling potential 
immigrants that "given the large number of applications, we . . . must inform 
you that there could be delays of up to a year or more before your application 
can be reviewed."

Charles Lewis, whose visits with Mayor Marion Barry in December at a downtown 
Ramada Inn provoked a major controversy, was arrested at a Virgin Islands hotel 
Friday on charges of selling cocaine to an undercover FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was charged with distribution of cocaine and possession of cocaine with 
intent to distribute, according to an FBI spokesman in San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
In late December, U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens began a federal grand jury probe 
into possible violations of drug and obstruction of justice statutes in the 
Ramada Inn episode. Two detectives planning to make an undercover drug buy from 
Lewis on Dec. 22 left the hotel after learning that Barry was in Lewis' hotel 
room. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents arrested Lewis in an eighth floor room at the luxurious Frenchman's 
Reef hotel in St. Thomas after he allegedly sold one of them six or seven grams 
of crack, a potent form of cocaine, according to FBI officials and a hotel 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, who has testified twice before the grand jury, issued a brief statement 
on the arrest. "This will raise the specter that something illegal happened 
when I visited Mr. Lewis when he was in Washington last December. . . . I never 
saw any drugs or drug paraphernalia during my visits with Mr. Lewis," he said.

FONDLING STORY: PRESS TRIPPED UP BY RUSH TO BE FIRST IN PRINT

<P>
It is a Washington journalist's worst nightmare: an explosive Page One story 
that rocks the White House, only to have the source turn out to be someone with 
a history of psychiatric problems. 
</P>
<P>
It happened this week to Washington Post investigative reporter Bob Woodward on 
a story that an Air Force sergeant had reported drunkenness and fondling of 
women by Defense Secretary-designate John Tower. The story appeared Thursday 
not only in the Post but in the Los Angeles Times and numerous other newspapers 
that subscribe to the Los Angeles Times-Washington Post News Service. 
</P>
<P>
And the credibility of more than that story was called into question. 
Particularly troubling, both to journalists and to government officials, was 
the incident's lesson about what can happen when the nation's major newspapers 
compete to be first into print. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
False Stories Planted 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Washington, trading on their high rank, commonly try to plant 
stories that sometimes are blatantly false, journalists admit. And some 
journalists believe that, because of the intensity of competition to be first 
with the news, the nation's newspapers allow themselves to be used as bulletin 
boards on which officials signal and manipulate one another. 
</P>
<P>
Especially at the White House, "with so many reporters competing for so few 
nuggets of news, reporters are more willing to run into print with 
unsubstantiated and in many cases incredible pieces of information," said 
Walter Robinson, White House correspondent for the Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
Often, said New York Times White House correspondent Bernard Weinraub, "with 
the competitive nature of it and the person who is saying it, you go with it." 
</P>
<P>
The origin of Woodward's story remains unclear. Robert Kaiser, the Post's 
assistant managing editor for national news, refused to disclose how the Post 
learned that the retired sergeant, Robert Jackson, had told the FBI and the 
Senate Armed Services Committee that, on two occasions in the 1970s, Tower had 
appeared drunk and fondled two women at Bergstrom Air Force Base near Austin, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Before publishing the story, Kaiser said, the Post confirmed that Jackson had 
indeed given his account to the FBI and the committee and that the account was 
in the FBI volume that the Senate was studying in relation to Tower's 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
But, on Thursday, the Air Force issued a report saying Jackson had left the 
service after being diagnosed as having "a mixed personality disorder" and that 
he was not assigned to the base in Texas in 1975 on the only occasion that 
Tower had visited it. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of how Woodward's story developed, examples are legion of the impact 
of high-ranking officials on the Washington press corps. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan's national security adviser, Robert C. 
McFarlane, once leaked a plan to arm Nicaragua's Contras with Korean weapons, 
hoping to generate support for the idea. One reporter on the receiving end of 
the leak -- he asked not to be named -- thought the plan had little chance of 
being approved but felt compelled to publish it anyway because of McFarlane's 
rank. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1986, White House sources opposed to then-Chief of Staff Donald T. 
Regan planted several stories suggesting that Regan was trying to mastermind a 
cover-up of the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, when President-elect Bush was considering naming John H. Sununu as 
his chief of staff, Sununu's rivals planted a story saying Bush was considering 
a troika of aides to run the White House staff. It was apparently an effort to 
get Bush to consider that approach, but Bush named Sununu anyway. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the Los Angeles Times ran a story from a highly placed White House 
source that the Administration was actively considering supplying El Salvador 
with advanced jet fighters. The story was leaked by someone in the 
Administration who was alarmed by the plan and wanted to derail it. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, the story was false -- the official had misunderstood the 
Administration's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
But an even more authoritative source at the National Security Council then 
confirmed it anyway, knowing it was a mistake, apparently because it served 
some purpose of his -- perhaps to pressure Salvadoran rebels or members of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"What an Administration's highest council's are planning is often not something 
you can go out and independently confirm," said Times national security 
reporter Doyle McManus. "That's why on that kind of story you have to be as 
explicit and precise as you can about your sourcing, to make the distinction 
between what you know to be true and what you're told." 
</P>
<P>
Now it is Tower's confirmation fight that is gripping Washington, and reporters 
generally understand that those who leak them information from the confidential 
FBI report on the defense secretary-designate are doing so for a purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Assessing the purpose is not always so easy. Many journalists in Washington 
this week wondered whether the Post had been set up by Republicans who knew 
that the story written by Woodward -- and thus the entire case against Tower -- 
would be discredited. 
</P>
<P>
The Post took that possibility seriously, prompting Kaiser to question Woodward 
about the source of the story. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic sources were peddling the story about Tower to other reporters 
Wednesday, and the New York Times tried to confirm it but could not. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of our reporters had picked up some pieces of that story, but they 
didn't have enough," the New York Times' deputy bureau chief, Philip Taubman, 
said. He said he did not know what the New York Times would have done if its 
reporters had learned as much as Woodward had. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser said the Post had not tried to confirm whether others could corroborate 
Jackson's account of Tower's behavior, only that his allegations existed. Nor 
did it check his reasons for leaving the military. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the FBI didn't check out his service record," Kaiser said. 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't the Post take more time? Competition was one factor. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the standards (of verifying news) are different with the time 
constraints," Post White House correspondent Ann Devroy said. "If you are 
trying to find out what is in the FBI report, it is not going to do much good 
if you find out three weeks from now."

About 2,000 students, protesting the selection of Republican National Committee 
Chairman Lee Atwater as a trustee of Howard University, took over an auditorium 
stage Friday, forcing officials to move a convocation that included 
presentation of an honorary degree to comedian Bill Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
Cosby was a scheduled speaker at a ceremony marking the founding of the 
predominantly black university 122 years ago. Police reported no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
The students' comments indicated they identified Atwater with controversial 
ads, during George Bush's presidential campaign last year, featuring Willie 
Horton, a murderer who attacked a Maryland couple while he was on furlough from 
a Massachusetts prison. The Horton issue contributed "to the rising anti-black 
sentiment of the American people," said a spokesman for students who organized 
the protest.

SECURITY TIGHTENED BEFORE STRIKE BEGAN

Federal authorities announced Friday they had made "extensive" preparations to 
ensure that air safety standards are upheld and to prevent violence or sabotage 
at airports in connection with the Eastern Airlines strike. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after President Bush announced that he would not intervene to head 
off the strike that started as scheduled at 9 p.m. PST, the Federal Aviation 
Administration said it had set up a central command post in Miami, where 
Eastern is headquartered, to monitor the airline's operations and all its 
maintenance facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said it would screen mechanics hired to replace striking Eastern 
workers to make sure they met government standards. 
</P>
<P>
Federal surveillance and aircraft inspections also were stepped up at all of 
Eastern's 11 hub cities and foreign operations and all 2,100 FAA aircraft 
inspectors were placed on alert to be dispatched to any Eastern facility "as 
needed," the agency said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA will "make sure that every plane Eastern puts into the air during this 
strike is airworthy and safe," said Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner. 
"If the FAA finds a plane that does not conform with standards, it will be shut 
down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We will not tolerate any threats of sabotage . . . on the ground or 
in the air." 
</P>
<P>
FAA Associate Administrator Anthony J. Broderick said the agency has ordered 
tighter security at airports serving Eastern, its sister airline Continental 
and other airlines whose mechanics are represented by the International Assn. 
of Machinists, the union striking Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
Airport security officers were put on special alert, and instructed to notify 
local police immediately if there is any violence on picket lines or threat of 
vandalism or sabotage to equipment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how serious the prospect of sabotage was. Skinner 
said there had not yet been any firm threats, but added that "it is clear . . . 
from the activity last week that the animosity between the union and the 
company is very intense." 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials were also concerned about the possibility of confrontations 
on picket lines that might be set up by sympathetic unions to disrupt 
operations at other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Amtrak announced it would add 12 high-speed Metroliner trains in 
runs between New York and Boston and New York and Washington on Monday to help 
offset any loss in airline service. 
</P>
<P>
But Amtrak spokesmen also said rail service could be cut substantially -- in 
areas outside the East as well as along the seaboard -- if Amtrak personnel 
decide to honor the machinists' picket lines. The agency said it is assigning 
supervisory personnel with training to operate some trains. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Service said it has prepared "contingency plans" for keeping 
mail delivery going by diverting the mail to other airlines and using chartered 
planes if Eastern is forced to ground substantial numbers of its aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Stewart, a spokesman for the Postal Service, said agency planners believe 
the strike "should not have a severe impact" on mail delivery even if Eastern 
finds it must shut down. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that in view of the 
possibility of transportation disruptions, the Transportation Department "will 
monitor the situation and . . . take whatever steps are needed to protect the 
safety of the traveling public." 
</P>
<P>
He said Bush was urging responsible labor officials "not to try to influence 
resolution of this dispute by disrupting the nation's transportation system 
through secondary boycotts" against other airlines.

NEW PROP. 103 PANEL MAY FORESHADOW POLITICAL ENDORSEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Board of Equalization member Conway Collis and consumer advocate Harvey 
Rosenfield will announce on Monday formation of a citizen support commission 
for Proposition 103, the successful Nov. 8 ballot insurance measure sponsored 
by Rosenfield's Voter Revolt group. 
</P>
<P>
The move suggests that Collis has the inside track on getting Voter Revolt's 
endorsement if he decides to run for state insurance commissioner in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield and Collis were at pains Friday to say that there is as yet no 
commitment by Rosenfield to support Collis or by Collis to run for the job, 
which was made an elective position by Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Voter Revolt announced last week that it is searching for a candidate to 
endorse for insurance commissioner, specifying that it would not back 
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who has emerged as a leading 
Democratic prospect for the job. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview, Rosenfield and two associates in the Voter Revolt 
organization referred favorably to Collis as a prospective candidate. Collis, 
41, elected to the Board of Equalization in 1982, is a Democrat who has far 
less name identification than Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
Given its successful stewardship of Proposition 103 with little money against 
well-financed insurance industry opposition last year, Voter Revolt could carry 
considerable weight with an endorsement for commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
The new private organization to be announced Monday under Collis' chairmanship 
will be called the Proposition 103 Insurance Action Commission and is described 
by Collis as a "broad-based group to formulate long-term reform proposals" to 
carry forward the changes begun by Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Collis said Friday that one post-Proposition 103 change that the commission 
might advance is a requirement that insurance companies pay state income taxes 
in addition to the gross premium tax they pay now. He estimated that this might 
bring in $250 million a year. He said it might also encourage the development 
of group auto insurance policies permitted under Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Collis and Rosenfield said in separate interviews that the commission will be 
independent of Voter Revolt because it will be directed by Collis and will 
arrive at its own positions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prospective Candidates 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield said, however, that he and his associates have advised a number of 
prospective candidates for insurance commissioner that if they want Voter 
Revolt support, they ought to demonstrate their backing for implementing and 
expanding Proposition 103. Collis is the first prospective candidate to do 
that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"After the election, we asked him for help," Rosenfield said of Collis. "He 
came back with the notion of a commission. . . . We're really glad that someone 
is standing up to help us." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield added: "Anybody who helps us out and fights for 103 is a friend, but 
nobody should be mistaken that this indicates our endorsement of anyone. We've 
said, however, that our No. 1 criterion for endorsing is that someone has 
proved they are committed to working hard for consumers and helping us to do 
the same." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 103's best-known sponsor was consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who 
wrote a message for a new Voter Revolt fund-raising letter that has gone out in 
recent days, but Rosenfield said Friday, "We haven't talked to Nader about 
this, and he usually doesn't endorse candidates." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Nader, contacted in Washington, said Nader "is not taking any 
position on any candidate right now. But I can't say what he'd do in the 
future."

BURST PIPE SOAKS BONAVENTURE LOBBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All those ponds in the four floors of the lobby complex of the Bonaventure 
Hotel in downtown Los Angeles came in handy early Friday when a water pipe 
burst and cold water gushed out over lobby floors. Hotel workers with mops 
sloshed much of the water into the ponds and pushed the rest out onto Flower 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen firefighters used their "jaws of life" lifesaving tool, usually used 
for prying human victims out of wrecks, to finally stop the flooding by 
pinching the 1 1/2-inch chilled water pipe closed after nearly two hours. 
</P>
<P>
No guests were forced to leave their rooms. Hotel officials said there was 
"only a few thousand dollars" damage to several retail shops and restaurants 
and most were back in operation by nightfall. T'Boli, a fourth-floor Filipino 
restaurant, sustained minor carpet damage. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Manager Doug Dreher said faulty soldering may have caused the pipe 
rupture.

GROWER EXPECTED TO GET PERMITS FOR FARM-WORKER HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months of regulatory delay, a major grower in North San Diego County is 
expected to be granted county building permits next week to begin construction 
of much-debated housing for farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
The planned housing, which has generated considerable interest throughout 
California, is being built by Oceanside-based Singh Farms with the stated 
purpose of avoiding the defection of laborers newly legalized under the 
government immigration amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the West, growers long dependent on undocumented labor have voiced 
concern about the prospective loss of newly legalized farm workers who may 
decide to take jobs in less-taxing and better-paying industries. With spring 
and summer approaching, officials are watching the labor market closely. 
</P>
<P>
While praised by farm groups and some farm-labor advocates, the proposal by 
Singh Farms also ran into strong opposition from area residents concerned about 
clutter, crime, traffic and other problems. Some activists also expressed fears 
that such housing could be used for future "guest workers" to be brought in 
from Mexico especially for farm-labor tasks. Company officials denied any such 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
The considerable opposition resulted in lengthy delays for a project that was 
first expected to be built last year. 
</P>
<P>
However, after a series of hearings and appeals, Singh Farms appears to have 
passed its final hurdle. The building permits are expected to be granted next 
week, said Gloria Kelly, regional planner with the San Diego County Department 
of Planning and Land Use. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the $1.5-million facility should be completed in about five 
months, said George Williamson, a planning consultant for the project. Grading 
has already begun on the 4-acre site in rural Bonsall, next to Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the permits are pulled, they want to start getting that thing up," 
said Williamson, who works with the Lightfoot Planning Group in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
The project, designed to house more than 300 workers, is to include a pair of 
two-story residential buildings, each outfitted with bunks. Other rooms will be 
used for dining, laundry, storage, bathrooms and recreation, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The housing will be open only to workers for Singh Farms, which cultivates 
about 700 acres in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to various concerns, Williamson said, Singh has agreed to make a 
number of modifications to its initial plans. Among other things, he said, the 
company will now provide more street lights and expanded recreational areas, 
and will make added improvements in streets. 
</P>
<P>
The planned housing development for migrants has not spawned any copycat 
</P>
<P>
proposals in San Diego County, where thousands of farm workers live outdoors in 
crude shacks and hovels that, experts agree, constitute some of the worst 
migrant-labor living conditions in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of employers who might have thought about providing housing 
looked at the incredible hassle that (Singh) went through and decided they 
wouldn't want to go through the same thing," said Wendy Dietrich-Benz, 
executive director of the San Diego County Farm Bureau, an industry group. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County's $500-million farm industry ranks it among the nation's 
top-20 agricultural counties, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
Although conditions in barracks-type farm-worker housing has often been found 
to be substandard, migrant advocates note that it is still a considerable 
improvement over living in the brush. Also, the facilities are subject to state 
and federal inspection.

LAKE MIRAMAR PROJECT FOES QUALIFY FOR VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Save Miramar Lake Committee has collected enough valid signatures on 
petitions to force a citywide referendum on a developer's plan to build 3,360 
homes north of Lake Miramar, San Diego City Clerk Charles Abdelnour said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A sample by the county registrar of voters of 5% of the names turned in by the 
group Feb. 7 and 8 showed that it collected 37,718 valid signatures, far more 
than the 25,594 needed to qualify for the ballot, Abdelnour said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Inevitable Battle' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm jubilant, extremely pleased," said J. Gary Underwood, co-chairman of the 
organization, which gathered more than 47,000 signatures in one month to force 
the vote. "We knew we had it, and I guess the next step now is to prepare for 
the inevitable battle with the developer." 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Bob Glaser, co-chairman of San Diegans for Managed 
Growth (SDMG), said Friday that his organization has decided to mount a 
petition drive to place a citywide initiative protecting San Diego's 
environmentally sensitive lands on an upcoming ballot. 
</P>
<P>
SDMG is still evaluating whether to aim for the San Diego City Council primary 
elections Sept. 19 or a later ballot, but has concluded that the compromise 
growth-management plan approved by the council in January does not adequately 
protect hillsides, flood plains and wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
"It's window dressing," said Glaser, who also serves as attorney for the Save 
Miramar Lake Committee. "It's not a plan. It's captions and slogans and 
directions to staff to write a plan." 
</P>
<P>
Two environmental protection plans, one forwarded by the City Council and 
another written by Citizens for Limited Growth, were defeated in last 
November's election. Both were part of growth-management plans that included 
controversial caps on home construction. 
</P>
<P>
SDMG last year mounted a campaign to place a separate environmental protection 
ordinance on the ballot, but abandoned that effort in favor of working to help 
shape the city's plan. Some SDMG leaders were dissatisfied with the final city 
product, claiming that it had been gutted by development industry 
representatives who were also on a city-appointed committee that wrote the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Miramar Lake referendum, which is being closely watched by the city's 
environmental and slow-growth leaders, faces at least two obstacles before 
Abdelnour can certify it for placement on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BCE Has Filed Suit 
</P>
<P>
BCE Development, which has an approved "development agreement" to build the 
homes on 1,200 acres in Miramar Ranch North, has filed suit in Superior Court 
to declare the petitions invalid. A hearing on that matter will be held 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Also, BCE or any other interested party can force Abdelnour to check the 
validity of every signature by paying about $30,000 for the effort by Thursday 
evening. Donna Nenow, spokeswoman for BCE, said that the company had made no 
decision on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
If the referendum is certified by Abdelnour, the council must rescind the 
development agreement or place the referendum before voters within 11 months. 
Abdelnour's office has suggested that the Sept. 19 primary, which will be the 
first election conducted under the city's new district-only voting plan, would 
be the most economical time to hold the election. 
</P>
<P>
Four council members -- including District 5 representative Ed Struiksma, who 
represents the area and strongly backs the development project -- are running 
for re-election in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
Struiksma said Friday that, with the court action pending, it is too early for 
him to comment on when the referendum might be held and how it could affect his 
re-election chances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only 658 Homes Opposed 
</P>
<P>
Underwood's group opposes only 658 of the homes, an industrial park and a road 
slated to be built on the picturesque hills immediately north of the lake. But, 
because the city granted BCE a development agreement, a binding contract under 
which the city gives the developer a guaranteed right to build the homes in 
return for early construction of schools, parks, roads and a library, the 
community group must overturn the entire project. 
</P>
<P>
Underwood called on the council to rescind the agreement, eliminating the need 
for a referendum. "I hope the City Council saves everybody a lot of money," 
Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Underwood's group, relying heavily on volunteers, spent $20,353 to qualify for 
the ballot. A rival group, backed by $445,000 of BCE's money, spent $457,000 to 
oppose that effort and collect more than 52,000 signatures supporting BCE's 
plans.

FRAZEE SEEKS TO AMEND FARM-WORKER BILL; 
</P>
<P>
EMERGENCY FUNDS SOUGHT FOR MIGRANT HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A state senator who represents North County plans to amend a farm-worker 
housing bill to include money for emergency shelter, a move that could 
alleviate the sort of upheaval caused recently when an immigrant camp in 
Carlsbad was uprooted. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Robert Frazee (R-Carlsbad) will undertake the changes to establish a fund 
to provide temporary housing to migrant field hands, according to Richard 
Ledford, a legislative aide to the senator. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the emergency money surfaced during a meeting Friday of state and 
local officials concerned with the migrant housing problem. Participants 
suggested that steps be taken to provide the funds, which would be included in 
a bill Frazee is sponsoring that calls for $500,000 in seed money to build 
permanent farm-worker housing. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon encampments across North County are under increasing fire from public 
health officials and municipal authorities, who see the enclaves as health and 
fire hazards. 
</P>
<P>
The spotlight was trained recently on a camp in south Carlsbad known as Valle 
Verde, which was razed a month ago. Many immigrants in the camp, which had 
existed in relative peace for six years, moved to a canyon in Encinitas, 
prompting protest from neighbors there. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those migrants dispersed this week when the city announced plans to 
raid the canyon and charge them with trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the bill is approved by the Legislature, money for the emergency 
housing would not be available until next year, Ledford said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, officials with the state Housing and Community Development 
Department agreed at the meeting to begin working with a local nonprofit 
agency, the North County Chaplaincy, to try to tap existing emergency funds to 
provide trailers to house immigrants, Ledford said.

CUTS WON'T HALT THE HOISTING OF SMALL-CRAFT WARNING FLAGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Weather Service's recent decision to stop calling local harbors 
with small-craft storm warnings will mean at least one harbor agency has to 
monitor the radio more closely. But, authorities say, boaters still will be 
able to rely on the agencies, which will continue to hoist warning flags. 
</P>
<P>
"This just means we'll need to keep a little closer track along the weather 
station channel," said Sgt. John Liddle of the Mission Bay Lifeguard Service's 
Boating Safety Unit. "In the past, we've relied on the telephone call to give 
us that information. It makes us do one more step or two more steps, but 
there's no problem with that." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the National Weather Service ended its 100-year tradition of 
telephoning local harbors to advise them to raise flags warning boaters of 
winds of up to 25 knots. A spokeswoman for the weather service in Silver 
Spring, Md., said the decision was prompted by a cutback in personnel and 
because the service wanted to make boaters more responsible for finding out 
weather conditions themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mission Bay boaters will still be able to rely on the Boating Safety 
Unit, Liddle said: "Hopefully, boaters will be a little more responsible to 
monitor their marine radios or make those telephone calls," referring to a 
24-hour, regularly updated recording put out by the weather service. 
</P>
<P>
Liddle said authorities did not expect any problems or an increase in accidents 
because of the change. The weather service will contact local agencies if there 
are unusual conditions such as flooding, or if a serious storm is expected, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego Bay, the Harbor Police will keep track of weather conditions put 
out by the state Office of Emergency Services on the California Law Enforcement 
Teletype System. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past the National Weather Service would just call us . . . (then) we 
were tossed into a requirement to find some other way to get that information," 
said Harbor Police Capt. Martin Hight. Harbor Police considered getting the 
information from Coast Guard stations still being notified by the weather 
service, but then found that they could use the Teletype system, Hight said. 
</P>
<P>
"The National Weather Service had a good point in that the reason they chose to 
no longer notify is that it's available on a continuous basis from the radio . 
. . you don't have to rely on the warning posted by various harbors." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Mission Bay Lifeguard Service, the Harbor Police do not monitor the 
weather channel on the radio, Hight said.

CITY TO FORM PROP. G POLICE REVIEW BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego city officials have decided to implement a new police review board 
approved by voters under Proposition G in November and not to wait for the 
outcome of a lawsuit challenging the city attorney's ruling that a rival, 
tougher review board should also be impaneled. 
</P>
<P>
George Penn, an assistant to the city manager, said Friday that he expects the 
Proposition G panel to be in operation by mid-May, noting that the city already 
has received the names of 50 people nominated to serve on the review board. 
</P>
<P>
Penn also said that, if the courts rule in favor of the rival review board 
under Proposition F, which was also approved by voters, then both panels would 
be created. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sensitive to This Problem' 
</P>
<P>
"We're sensitive to this problem," Penn told the luncheon gathering at the 
Catfish Club, an organization made up primarily of minority business and 
community leaders in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"If a court of law says we must have two police review boards, we'll implement 
both." 
</P>
<P>
Final ballot totals last November showed that both Propositions F and G 
received a majority of "yes" votes. Proposition F's tally was 179,102 to 
155,341, and Proposition G drew 179,917 to 160,166. 
</P>
<P>
Because Proposition G had 815 more "yes" votes, the city attorney ruled that 
that board should be created. It calls for a board appointed by the city 
manager, but in most other respects it would be similar to the current police 
review board. 
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit last month, contending that 
the Proposition F board should also be impaneled. That board calls for a review 
process in which police officers would be subpoenaed to testify in closed 
hearings about allegations of misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
A March 21 court hearing is scheduled in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Favor of Review Mechanism 
</P>
<P>
Penn said the fact that both propositions received a majority of approval votes 
shows that citizens are indeed concerned about allegations of police misconduct 
and are in favor of some kind of police review mechanism to ensure that errant 
officers are properly disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, whether one review board or two panels are created, the board 
members must remember that they represent the public and do not simply mimic 
the Police Department. He said many review boards across the country have 
failed because they found themselves acting as apologists for their local 
police officials. 
</P>
<P>
"You're there as a board member to serve a function, to be an advocate for the 
community," Penn said. 
</P>
<P>
The members of the existing police review board, formed in 1987, were appointed 
by both the city manager and the police chief, a process that irritated many 
community leaders and led to the ballot proposals for an alternative review 
method. 
</P>
<P>
Penn said none of the current review board members would be included in either 
of the two new boards because voters made it clear they do not want the police 
chief involved in the appointments. "You can see the obvious perception of 
impropriety if someone is chosen by the police chief," he said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Encanto man was convicted Friday of premeditated attempted murder in the 
shooting of a driver who had given the defendant a ride. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Superior Court jury deliberated for only two hours before 
convicting Michael Manuel Brito, 26, of attempted murder, which carries a 
penalty of life in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Eugene Smith, 27, who was shot in the back, identified Brito in 
court as the man who shot him Aug. 12. Smith, who worked for the San Diego Park 
and Recreation Department, said he stopped on California 94 after seeing the 
defendant with a gas can. The assailant pointed a gun at him while getting into 
his car, Smith testified, then shot him. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman drove off in Smith's 1981 Cadillac, which was later found stripped 
at the end of the street Brito lived on. 
</P>
<P>
The jury also convicted Brito of assault with a deadly weapon and robbery, and 
ruled that the victim suffered great bodily injuries, which adds three years to 
the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek said Brito faces a probable life sentence, plus a 
consecutive term of 11 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ross Tharp set sentencing for April 7. 
</P>
<P>
After the conviction, the judge ruled that Brito had been convicted of grand 
theft and burglary several years ago, a finding that adds six years to the 
sentence, said Dusek. 
</P>
<P>
Brito, a mechanic, was arrested Aug. 22 after a tip to the Crime Stoppers 
program.

MISFITS IN THE URBAN COLLAGE; 
</P>
<P>
RUSHDIE'S CHARACTERS COULD BE OUR NEW NEIGHBORS 
</P>

Of what relevance is Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses" in the City of 
Angels? Why does this celebrated tale of self-doubting Muslims in London and 
Bombay resonate so in the corner mini-malls and polylingual schools of this 
city of migrants? 
</P>
<P>
"The Satanic Verses" is really a novel about the metamorphosis of the 
contemporary world brought about by migration and communication. It is about 
the conflicts within individuals and between cultures that result from the 
immediate juxtaposition in time (mass media, telecommunications) and space 
(migration) of very different world views and civilizations. It is is a novel 
about the conflicts and spiritual dislocation of fragmented individuals in a 
fragmented world wrestling with its plural identities. "The Satanic Verses" is 
a novel about the frictions of the global collage, the kind of frictions that 
transpire daily in global cities like Los Angeles, which have no identity other 
than their plurality: We are a little bit Seoul, Saigon, Taipei, Hong Kong, 
Mexico City, Managua, San Salvador, Tokyo, even Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
In Rushdie's celebrated work the traditional world is blown apart by the 
metamorphosing agency of a 747 jumbo jet. "Up there in air-space," the author 
writes, "in that soft imperceptible field which had been made possible by the 
century and which, thereafter, made the century possible, becoming one of its 
defining locations, the place of movement and of war, the planet-shrinker and 
power-vacuum, most insecure and transitory of zones, illusory, discontinuous, 
metamorphic -- because when you throw everything up in the air anything becomes 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie speaks of migrants who ply the routes between different worlds as 
"fragments, absurd, debris of the soul . . . (with) broken memories, 
sloughed-off selves, severed mother tongues, untranslatable jokes, extinguished 
futures, lost loves, the forgotten meaning of hollow, booming words, land, 
belonging, home." These migrants from the past long for the certitude of 
origins but only "embrace air." 
</P>
<P>
The immigrants in "The Satanic Verses" are split identities, hybrids. The movie 
star, Gibreel Farishta, plays 11 roles simultaneously; the radio personality, 
Saladin Chamcha, has 44 different voices. 
</P>
<P>
As a Bombay-born Muslim, Rushdie must ask himself the same questions as the 
other 900,000 Muslims residing in Britain: "Am I Indian, Pakistani, British?" 
Like Dr. Aziz, a character in one of Rushdie's earlier novels, "Midnight's 
Children," who loses his faith because he is unable to accept the unarguable 
absolutes of religion, Rushdie is left "with a hole inside, a vacancy in the 
vital inner chamber." In the way of the Westerner, Rushdie the immigrant turns 
from faith to literature as the medium of his doubt and reconciliation between 
worlds, between past and future. 
</P>
<P>
"What I am saying in 'Satanic Verses'," Rushdie has remarked, "is that we have 
got to come to terms with our plural identities. We are increasingly becoming a 
world of migrants, made up of bits and fragments from here, there. We are here. 
And we have not really left anywhere where we have been." Just as migration 
transplants other pasts into our present, the information age carries our 
present time into the otherworld of Islamabad, Khartoum, Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
The furor caused by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death sentence of Rushdie 
mimics the very theme of "The Satanic Verses." Rushdie's life could be at risk 
only in the very kind of world that his novel describes -- a world of global 
integration in which the blasphemous can engage in a fatal "war of 
nomenclatures," a clash of faiths and languages. It is the Word against words. 
Milan Kundera has said that the novel is able to exist in the West because it 
requires ambiguity and relativity, not a unique truth that must be conformed 
to. Rushdie the novelist, like the Western novel itself, blasphemes the 
absolute; Khomeini blasphemes the only sacred values of the West: skepticism, 
relativism, pluralism and tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
Not in his most fertile imaginative moments could Rushdie have dreamed up a 
scene where the ancient religious rivalries that drive Iran's revolutionary 
politics are played out on the bookshelves of America's chain stores, nor could 
he have envisioned a united, usually squabbling Western Europe rising to the 
defense of the idea of the novel. How very extraordinary, after decades of 
hardened balance-of-power Realpolitik, that the world should be divided between 
those who defend the possibility of literature and those who don't. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the Cold War has lost its impetus, it seems our new preoccupation will 
be with the Battle of the Novel, or as Rushdie himself prefers to put it, the 
War of the Word -- a drama of struggle between different civilizations that 
must live in one interdependent world. 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, Rushdie and Khomeini, the main protagonists of the story, are 
tasting the fate of all actors in the paradox of history. Inadvertently, 
Rushdie's "sacrilege" has resuscitated Khomeini's waning fundamentalist fervor 
-- infidel as evangelist. Inadvertently, Khomeini's death sentence, against 
Rushdie but really against the idea of the novel, has revived the waning 
importance of literature in the West -- imam as literary agent. 
</P>
<P>
Such are the unexpected twists of plot, the play of contraries, that we will 
learn to expect as this grand drama of the closing years of the last modern 
century unfolds.

RETHINKING THE MULTICULTURAL IDEAL; 
</P>
<P>
DO IMMIGRANTS FIT IF COMMUNITY NEEDS COMMONALITY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM PFAFF, William Pfaff is a syndicated columnist based in Paris. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The gravest issue posed by the Salman Rushdie affair is that of cultural 
collision inside the Western countries. The subject tends to be shunned for 
fear that its identification may promote an invidious discrimination -- as 
indeed it may. Yet it is a fundamental issue in the countries with big 
immigrant minorities radically different from the host populations in religious 
or political-cultural convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie's problems began, after all, in Britain, not Iran. India quietly banned 
his book after it was published last fall. It was when Muslims in the city of 
Bradford, in the north of England, where one in seven of the population is of 
Indian or Pakistani origin, organized a public burning of "The Satanic Verses" 
in January that the affair gained international notoriety. Without that event, 
one may think that the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini might never have heard of 
Salman Rushdie or of his book, written in the English language and the Western 
intellectual and aesthetic idiom, meant for a secular and Western readership. 
</P>
<P>
He did hear of it, and as a result at least 18 people are now dead and there is 
uproar in a score of countries. Rushdie was burned in effigy on Fifth Avenue in 
New York last week. Home Secretary Douglas Hurd has felt obliged to warn 
Britain's Islamic community that violence or the threat of violence in protest 
against Rushdie's writings is intolerable. In France, Prime Minister Michel 
Rocard has formally warned that "appeals for murder, under whatever form, will 
be prosecuted." 
</P>
<P>
Many have observed that these events have drastically undermined the efforts 
that have been made for the peaceful integration of Islamic immigrants in 
Western Europe -- efforts conducted, as a writer in Le Monde has said, against 
the opposition of those who oppose immigration on grounds "of a pretended 
non-assimilation of Islam into a secular society." It is not, though, a 
"pretended" problem; it is a real one. 
</P>
<P>
Every political community rests on a general acceptance of certain beliefs 
about social and political values. In immigrant countries, that consensus can 
be achieved in several ways, all painful for the immigrant group. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, the leading immigrant nation, has, historically, broken down 
and assimilated its immigrants to "Americanism" by means of a public education 
system that never questions the primacy of American political values, and 
through the exercise of a powerful social conformism. Popular culture in 
America has also proven to be an overwhelming assimilative force, as it has 
elsewhere in the West. It is America's peculiar good fortune that its 
immigrants have nearly always wanted to assimilate. The first generation might 
cling to "foreign" ways, but the second generation has nearly always 
Americanized itself with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, France is the country that has taken in the most immigrants during 
the 19th and 20th centuries. Assimilation has been enforced by a state 
education system that teaches French civilization and political values without 
compromise, starting out by sitting each immigrant child down to learn about 
"his" ancestors, the ancient Gauls. 
</P>
<P>
Not all national societies have this confidence in themselves, or this 
arrogance. Britain has taken a different course. Since the breakup of the 
British Empire after World War II, it has admitted large numbers of 
Afro-Caribbeans and Indo-Pakistanis from its former colonies. It has adopted 
the goal of a "multicultural" society as government policy. There has not been 
any express attempt to assimilate immigrants to the ideas and attitudes of the 
British majority. 
</P>
<P>
The same policy is increasingly called for, or followed, in Australia, Canada, 
the United States and the other countries that continue to accept large numbers 
of immigrants. In the United States, it is posed in the demand for multilingual 
education. 
</P>
<P>
This policy is defended as a matter of justice as well as of respect for the 
beliefs and cultural legacies of others. Why should people be expected to 
abandon their children to ideas and values alien to themselves? What cultural 
superiority does the accepting country possess that it should dictate on such 
matters to the immigrant? Is this not "cultural chauvinism?" Indeed, is it not 
racism, or something uncomfortably close to that? 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that without a community of values and cultural assumption there is 
no community at all. Do you believe that Rushdie, or anyone else, has the right 
to say and publish whatever is on his mind? Do you think that the freedom to do 
so is essential to the political community in which you wish to live? Or do you 
believe that God's truth, as you understand it, should be enforced against 
false ideas -- or even that offenders against that truth deserve to die? 
</P>
<P>
You can believe the one or the other. You can't believe both. A coherent 
political community cannot exist without a consensus of agreement on one or the 
other. That is the problem that Salman Rushdie and his book are forcing people 
to confront.

EUROPE TAKES OZONE LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A day late, President Bush Friday joined the European-led parade for a total 
ban by the year 2000 on the chemicals that deplete the ozone layer in the 
atmosphere. It is embarrassing for this country to be following someone else's 
lead on critical environmental issues so much of the time, but Bush's reaction 
time was an improvement over the Reagan Administration's response to such 
things. It probably would be calling for more study. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is a bit of a hitch. The Bush promise was made contingent upon 
finding safe alternatives. But the ozone-hole problem now is known to be so 
serious that there can be no conditions. The world must end the use of 
chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-depleting chemicals just as soon as 
possible. Substitutes must be found. There simply is no other choice. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers of foam containers, such as the hamburger boxes used by fast-food 
outlets, already have found other chemicals. Chemists still are trying to 
perfect an alternative for chlorofluorocarbons in refrigeration units, and it 
is hard to believe they cannot do so during the coming dozen years. Apparently 
the British are close to a solution now. 
</P>
<P>
The erosion of the ozone layer, of course, is a new, cosmic sort of 
environmental problem that has not been dealt with before. Scientists for some 
years theorized that chlorine and bromine atoms freed from the breakdown of the 
chlorofluorocarbons were affecting the ozone layer of the stratosphere between 
9 and 15 miles above the Earth's surfaces. This is important because the ozone 
shields the Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays from the Sun. As the ozone 
layer is eroded, the penetrating ultraviolet rays can dramatically increase the 
incidence of skin cancer and cause other health problems. 
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, scientists have detected the alarming effect on the 
ozone layer above the Antarctic -- much greater than expected -- and just 
recently discovered "incredible" concentrations of chemicals in the Arctic 
region. 
</P>
<P>
The United States joined other nations in Montreal last year in agreeing to cut 
the production of chlorofluorocarbons by about 50% by the end of the century. 
But scientific observations of recent months have demonstrated that will not be 
sufficient. The complete ban by the year 2000 should be approved quickly by 
signers of the Montreal Protocol, and the ban should be made effective even 
sooner, when a substitute is found for chlorofluorocarbons for use in 
refrigerators, air conditioners and other such units.

REPUBLICANS AND DUKE'S ELECTION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Political chickens don't always come home to roost, but Atwater and Bush are 
hosts to at least a small pullet, as moral consequences are measured these 
days, in the election of Duke to the Louisiana legislature. 
</P>
<P>
It was Atwater who invoked the atavistic fear of blacks in the white voters of 
this country, which was crucial in winning the presidency for George Bush, by 
making Willie Horton the nightmare issue he became. 
</P>
<P>
Was it a certain sense of guilt that made him and Bush (and Ronald Reagan, too) 
try so hard to get this Ku Kluxer and race-hate inciter defeated? 
</P>
<P>
Like Atwater, he knew what it takes to get elected and he went for it, 
regardless of the truth, good taste, or guilt by association.

SAVING THE EARTH'S ENVIRONMENT: 'PLANET IN TROUBLE' AND U.S. AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Worldwatch Institute's 1989 State of the World report recites the latest in the 
by now familiar saga of disappearing forests and spreading deserts ("Planet in 
Trouble," editorial, Feb. 21). Regrettably, projects which the United States 
funded in the name of development have often made things worse. We should 
insist that our aid contributes to environmental preservation, not destruction. 
</P>
<P>
It would be easy, and wrong, to blame Third-World poor people for increased 
desertification. In poor regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America people 
desperate to feed themselves and their children have cleared forests, 
overgrazed pastures and depleted topsoils. They do not see that they have any 
choice but to exploit these resources to the fullest in order to survive. We in 
the developed world do have a choice. As pointed out last year in Food Monitor, 
poor agricultural practices are often instigated by development institutions 
(supported by our tax dollars). 
</P>
<P>
To end this misuse of our aid money, Congress should adopt the Global Poverty 
Reduction Act, which states that all development activities included in a 
global plan for poverty reduction be "consistent with maintaining and restoring 
the renewable natural resource base. Primary emphasis should be on small-scale 
affordable, resource conserving, low-risk local projects using appropriate 
technologies (including traditional agricultural methods) suited to local 
environmental, resource and climactic conditions and featuring close 
consultation with local people at all stages of project design and 
implementation." 
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection should be written into our foreign aid law, and our 
aid agency should be held to account for carrying it out.

SEE ON BARBARA TUCHMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The death of Barbara Tuchman has quite properly occasioned numerous eulogies of 
this distinguished historian. Her clarity, grace, style, and narrative gifts 
have all been justly celebrated. Unfortunately, such encomiums have been 
accompanied by a rather virulent strain of academy-bashing, a notable example 
of which is found in Carolyn See's column (Editorial Page, Feb. 11). University 
history faculties are depicted as snobbish elites, dominated by reactionary 
white males, dedicated only to the maintenance of their control over the 
profession and the production of turgid, unreadable scholarly tomes on subjects 
of no consequence. Their dismissal of popular historians like Tuchman is said 
to proceed from a disdain for anyone without a Ph.D. attempting to write 
history. 
</P>
<P>
It is not true that the profession has ignored Tuchman. Ironically, on the same 
page as See's column appears the text of the address that Tuchman delivered to 
the American Historical Assn. in 1966. It should be noted that an invitation to 
address the AHA is considered a signal honor within the profession, which makes 
nonsense of See's claim that Tuchman was one of the "invisibles" (writers 
ignored by the professoriate). 
</P>
<P>
Another of See's alleged "invisibles" is Diane Johnson. See is evidently 
unaware that Johnson has taught English at UC Davis for a number of years, and 
that she was unanimously elected president of the Pacific Coast Conference on 
British Studies, an academic organization of over 200 members. 
</P>
<P>
If Tuchman has not been ignored by the profession, is it not true that she has 
been subjected to criticism? Most certainly -- just as the works of most 
academic historians have been. Professors and non-professors alike who write 
seriously about the past are part of a large international community of 
scholars. Their views are subjected to close critical scrutiny, in the books 
and articles of subsequent writers, as well as in the book reviews that 
constitute an important part of journals like the American Historical Review. 
This ceaseless challenging, revising, and refining of established views of the 
past make history the lively and valuable discipline it is. Out of this 
multifaceted dialogue emerges new subjects of historical inquiry and new 
methodologies for investigating them. 
</P>
<P>
Among the many new areas of investigation, women's history and histories of 
ethnic minorities are (contrary to See's claim) burgeoning fields of 
scholarship, in which work of great importance and distinction is being 
published. I invite her and other interested readers to examine any recent 
issue of the American Historical Review for a good sense of the kind of work 
being written by the dedicated men and women of the historical profession. 
</P>
<P>
They range from specialized monographs to general histories, from conventional 
narrative accounts to statistical studies, but few of them deal with 
inconsequential matters. Studies of the history of topics like the family, the 
environment, war, racism, and technology abound, and it is clear that 
policy-makers and the public alike would benefit from reading them. 
</P>
<P>
That it should be necessary to point out perhaps reveals a major public 
relations challenge for academics in general and for historians in particular. 
By all means, let's enter upon a sustained and serious dialogue about the 
nature and value of history in our society, but let's not doom it at the outset 
by shrill invective and misrepresentation. Such a conversation would be a 
fitting tribute to the ever wise, honest, and tolerant Barbara Tuchman.

BORDER DITCH CONTROVERSY

<TEXT>
<P>
Only time will tell whether the controversial border ditch will really reduce 
drug and illegal alien traffic from Mexico. But, the arrogance and hypocrisy of 
the Mexican government in opposing the project is outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
The ditch will be entirely on U.S. land. It will have absolutely no effect on 
aliens who are in the U.S. legally, or on any legitimate commerce between the 
two countries. But, it will hurt the drug lords and the coyotes who deal in 
human misery.

Let's dig the ditch! It's worth a try!

SEE ON BARBARA TUCHMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carolyn See's warm tribute to Barbara Tuchman misses an important point: The 
Ph.D. Establishment in history departments throughout the world (yes!) has 
little in common with a successful writer of history, whatever the writer's 
gender. 
</P>
<P>
In areas of research that have been combed over for many decades -- and 
sometimes centuries -- the method matters more than the content, let alone the 
readability. Such theories as revisionist, deconstructionist, semiotic, 
psychoanalytic, etc. have replaced the old-fashioned realist, Marxist or even 
royalist approaches to history. Historiography has become a subject unto itself 
and is taught in most graduate schools in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
It is indeed sad that such a chasm exists but the two "sides" can only meet at 
Armageddon. Or perhaps afterward. And since we surely don't want that, Ms. See, 
we'll have to accept the sorry fact that the Barbara Tuchmans of this world -- 
of which there are never enough -- will go unrecognized by those who consider 
themselves "professional" historians. 
</P>
<P>
But here is some comfort: I seem to remember that Vice President Quayle read 
"The Guns of August." And he liked what he read . . . and probably understood 
it too.

REPUBLICANS AND DUKE'S ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Jason Berry in Opinion ("A Master Racist Jumps Parties to Land in 
the Louisiana Legislature," Feb. 26), former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, now 
Louisiana state legislator David Duke has learned the strategic necessity of 
political deception. His National Assn. of White People News advises that since 
the public regards white supremacy as immoral, racist activists should conceal 
their opinions and only talk about racial differences. Duke characterizes his 
group as a "civil-rights organization." 
</P>
<P>
In the same section of The Times, former Reagan Administration war planner, now 
right-wing think-tank member Fred C. Ikle declares that the Reagan 
Administration had us on a fast road to democracy in Central America when the 
Congress interfered by stopping military funds for the Contras and now may even 
cut military funds for El Salvador ("Sell-Out in Central America," Op-Ed Page). 
</P>
<P>
Ikle is more circumspect than Duke, but if he were equally frank he might 
advise that since the public regards terrorism, death squads, and massacres as 
immoral, war advocates should be careful to speak only of the fast track to 
democracy.

FRANK THE TRAINMAN, 'DEAN OF COLLECTORS,' DIES OF HEART ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Cox, known to generations of San Diegans as "Frank the Trainman" because 
of a four-decade affiliation with his own model train shop, died Thursday of a 
heart attack. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the dean of train collectors," said Tom Sefton, president of San Diego 
Trust &amp; Savings Bank, who said he and Cox had been friends since 1946. "He 
was responsible more than anyone else by far for the introduction of trains at 
Christmas time . . . for the young finding trains under the tree. He was a fine 
person. The hobby will miss him very much." 
</P>
<P>
Cox, who was born in England but moved to San Diego 76 years ago, opened the 
Frank the Trainman Shop at 4310 Park Blvd. in 1943, after having sold and 
displayed trains out of the garage of his home on Cleveland Avenue in 
University Heights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legendary Neon Sign 
</P>
<P>
His shop was characterized by a legendary neon sign that went up in 1947 and 
remains in place at the same location -- although the site was recently taken 
over by a branch of Mission Federal Credit Union. 
</P>
<P>
The current Frank the Trainman Shop is operated at 4207 Park Blvd. by Jim 
Cooley, Cox's protege and successor. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cooley said he and Cox were friends, he laughed when asked to assess 
his former boss as a fellow human being. 
</P>
<P>
"He could be a great person -- when he wanted to be," Cooley said with a 
chuckle. "He didn't have many interests besides trains. He loved to dance. He 
and his wife used to go dancing. 
</P>
<P>
"At times he would go out of his way for folks, especially with the trains and 
such. He was respected for the work he did with the San Diego Railroad Club. He 
helped a lot of members. Everybody could always turn to him when they had 
questions. He always had an answer." 
</P>
<P>
Cooley said regular customers of Cox's included former baseball star Steve 
Garvey and Sen. Pete Wilson, whom he described as model-train aficionados. But 
the thing that most appealed to Cox about owning his own shop was being his own 
boss. 
</P>
<P>
"Not having to work with or answer to other people," Cooley said. "Before, he 
was always working for someone else. Here, he worked for himself, by himself. 
The shop gave him independence. It also got him into a field where he was the 
expert." 
</P>
<P>
Cooley said the most excited he ever saw Cox was when a customer would bring a 
rare model train into the shop. 
</P>
<P>
"He would beam and gleam," Cooley said. "He lived to see things like an old 
Carlisle &amp; Finch. That would get him cooking like nothing else would." 
</P>
<P>
Asked his boss' single-most important contribution, Cooley said: "Just say that 
he was devoted in his hobby. A hobby's important; it fills a void in a man's 
life. It's better than having your days slip away watching television." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dad Headed Shoe Section 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from high school in San Diego, Cox worked in the old Marston's 
Department Store. His father headed the shoe section. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the Great Depression, Cox switched jobs, signing on with the 
old Ben Hur Coffee Co., near the train tracks downtown. He became Frank the 
Trainman in 1941 after visiting a collector of trains, an experience he said he 
never forgot and which changed his life, inspiring him, as it did, to enter his 
own business. 
</P>
<P>
Cox left the shop in 1981, turning it over to Cooley. His health had 
deteriorated steadily since then, Cooley said. 
</P>
<P>
Cox is survived by his wife, Helen; his son, Frank L. Cox of Florida; two 
daughters, Dorothy Plock of Texas and Lucille Lopshire of Alaska; four 
grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Services will be held at 2 p.m. Tuesday at Lewis Colonial-Benbough Mortuary, 
followed by entombment at Cypress View Mausoleum.

MAN GUILTY OF FRAUD TOLD TO PAY $10,000 TO EX-WIFE, 81 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Hollywood man was ordered Friday to pay $10,000 in restitution to an 
81-year-old Tujunga woman whom authorities said he married so he could take her 
money and property. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin Steiner, 51, pleaded guilty in December to misdemeanor charges of grand 
theft and real estate fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Steiner began working as a gardener for Frances Hirsch in June, married her in 
September and persuaded her to go with him to Guadalajara, said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Daniel M. Greller. 
</P>
<P>
Steiner also persuaded Hirsch to make him a joint owner of her house, but her 
relatives became suspicious and hired an attorney, who had the marriage 
annulled, Greller said. 
</P>
<P>
In November, after the annulment and after his name had legally been removed 
from the deed to Hirsch's house, Steiner accepted an offer of $147,000 in a 
fraudulent sale of the house, Greller said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that this marriage was a sham," Greller said. "His intent 
all along was to defraud her." 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch's family managed to stop the illegal sale of her house and notified Los 
Angeles police, who arrested Steiner on Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Steiner originally was charged with felony counts of making false statements to 
a notary public -- the real estate agent -- and of unlawfully agreeing to sell 
Hirsch's house. 
</P>
<P>
After Steiner pleaded guilty to the reduced misdemeanor charges, San Fernando 
Municipal Judge Gregg Marcus sentenced him to three years probation. He was 
also sentenced to 100 hours of community service, a $500 fine and 31 days 
already served in jail. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Marcus ordered Steiner to pay $10,000 in restitution to Hirsch at a 
rate of $277 a month for three years. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hirsch did not lose her house, the $10,000 is to cover money she lost 
after Steiner used her bank funds to buy furniture, a new van and an older 
model pickup truck, according to a document filed by Hirsch's attorney, Herbert 
R. Seiden. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicles were resold but at far less than what Steiner paid for them, 
according to the document. The restitution will also cover Hirsch's legal 
costs, the document said.

FORMER RADIO SHOW HOST SENT TO JAIL FOR FAILING TO PAY STATE TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former radio talk show host from Mission Hills was sentenced to six months in 
jail Friday, and his wife received three years probation for failing to file 
state tax returns on more than $400,000 they earned from 1982 to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Willard and Evelyn Jenkins, who had pleaded guilty to the charges in September, 
were also ordered to pay more than $101,000 in taxes and interest not paid 
since 1979, when they stopped filing returns. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time that the couple, both 54, had faced a Van Nuys Municipal 
Court judge on tax evasion charges. Three years ago, each was ordered to 
perform 200 hours of community service and to pay back taxes for 1979 to 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Reber, spokesman for the state Franchise Tax Board, said those back taxes 
were never paid and have been added to the new fine. He also said the Jenkinses 
are among a handful of repeat offenders caught by comparing employment and bank 
tax records with personal returns. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins used to broadcast news weekdays for KABC radio and hosted "Open Mind," 
a now-defunct Saturday night call-in show. Reber said he believes that Jenkins 
has been a management consultant in recent years and that his wife worked as an 
office manager for a Newhall medical office. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins was taken directly to the Van Nuys Jail after Friday's sentencing; his 
wife could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In past interviews, Jenkins said the 16th Amendment, the section of the U.S. 
Constitution that gave Congress the authority to collect income taxes, was 
never properly ratified. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect we have a law that never was," he said after his 1986 trial. 
</P>
<P>
Reber said Friday's sentencing "sends out a strong message . . . that if you're 
going to get involved in this kind of frivolous action, where you blatantly 
violate the law, you'd better think twice." 
</P>
<P>
The Jenkinses will be offered the chance to pay the back taxes in installments, 
Reber said, but if they do not cooperate, the state can place liens against 
their property and garnishee their wages. 
</P>
<P>
The couple also failed to file federal tax returns during the nine years, Reber 
said, and could owe as much as $200,000 in federal taxes.

ENROLLMENT DRIVE KEEPS SCHOOL FROM DROPPING OUT

<P>
The principal of Burbank's Providence High School said Friday that efforts in 
past months to increase enrollment will keep the school from closing in June. 
</P>
<P>
Parents, teachers and graduates have been raising scholarship money and 
recruiting students since September to raise enrollment at the coeducational, 
parochial school from 200 to 300 students. 
</P>
<P>
The Sisters of Providence, a Seattle-based order that operates the school, had 
threatened to close it unless 100 more students were enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
"We were joined in prayer efforts by people all over the world," said Sister 
Lucille Dean, the school's principal. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to keep the school open was made after 112 eighth-grade students 
took the entrance exam Feb. 4, Dean said. That is a 165% increase over the 
number taking the test last year, she said.

<P>
Along with an expected 25 high school students who are expected to transfer to 
Providence over the summer, the school easily met its enrollment goal, Dean 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents and teachers from Providence recruited students and their parents from 
parochial elementary schools throughout the San Fernando Valley and other parts 
of Los Angeles, Dean said. The school, which charges annual tuition of $3,175, 
also took out advertisements in local newspapers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The group raised more than $25,000 from rummage sales and other events to pay 
for scholarships to entice top students, Dean said. The Sisters of Providence 
has promised to match the amount of money raised by the group for scholarships, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were ready to close and we were challenged to turn it around," said Carmen 
Ferrante, a parent and school volunteer. "We are very proud of what we've 
done." 
</P>
<P>
School officials announced last month new courses in health science and media 
communications as part of the recruitment effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to continue to actively market ourselves," Dean said.

For those who absolutely could not wait to see what fun things can happen with 
the 1989 Padres . . . they didn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
Friday afternoon, first spring game, first inning: Pitcher Bruce Hurst retires 
the Angels 1-2-3 on eight pitches, Tony Gwynn triples into the right-field 
bullpen, Jack Clark singles to score him, and the Padres lead. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't an inning, it was a season ticket brochure. Three hours later, the 
Padres had defeated the Angels, 10-6, and their best news was yet to come. An 
hour after the victory, Benito Santiago and Roberto Alomar agreed to contracts 
without the club automatically renewing them, a surprising settlement 
considering the parties were far apart just days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Said Clark about the baseball: "For a first game, it was a helluva game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Santiago about the contract: "I feel good, my agent feels good, and the 
Padres feel good, everything is good." 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with baseball's recent fixation, we'll explain the contracts first, 
the game later. As has often happened recently with the open-walleted Padres, 
the winners in those negotiations seemed to be the players. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago will play for $310,00, with incentives that could push him to 
$350,000, which is what he and agent Scott Boras were requesting in the first 
place. The Padres came up from an original offer of $275,000. This also will be 
the first time the Padres have given incentives -- extra money for being an 
All-Star, winning the Gold Glove, or other such accomplishments -- to a player 
with less than three years experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so great, I am so happy," said Santiago, who reluctantly accepted 
$165,000 last year after being rookie of the year, and then pouted over it for 
much of the early season. Both the Padres and Boras were particularly worried 
about hitting Santiago with contract renewal, by which a club can force a 
player with less than three years experience to play at their figure. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago admitted for the first time Friday that he was also fearful: 
"Sometimes when you renew, you worry what you will think about them, and what 
they will think about you," he said. "I want a good relationship with those 
guys (Padres) and this is great for that." 
</P>
<P>
Alomar will play for $155,000, an increase of about $30,000 from the Padres' 
original offer and close to what Santiago made last year, even though Alomar 
didn't finish in the top three in the rookie of the year voting. On Thursday, 
Alomar's brother, Sandy, agreed to a major league-minor league split contract 
that not only will make him one of baseball's highest-paid rookies ($77,000) 
but also one of its highest paid contracted minor leaguers ($30,000). 
</P>
<P>
"What I liked most about this was the process -- the Padres actually listened 
to me," Boras said. He met here for three hours Thursday with Tal Smith, acting 
general manager, and then finalized things today with Smith and interim 
President Dick Freeman in a 90-minute meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of clubs with players of limited experience, they won't listen," Boras 
said. "Like the Yankees, they just say, 'Here's what you're getting, take it or 
leave it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said that's not exactly how he wants the Padres to operate. 
</P>
<P>
"It was all a matter of a little concessions here, a little there. They'd give 
up something, we'd give up something," he said. "I'm very pleased with the way 
things worked out." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's baseball game went just as smoothly for the Padres. Hurst's three 
innings of one-run pitching impressed people nearly as much as his hitting. 
Yes, in his first at-bat since last spring (he hasn't had an official at-bat 
since the 1986 World Series), he actually fouled off two pitches to ovations 
from the Desert Sun Stadium crowd of 4,491. But then Angel pitcher Mike Witt 
broke off a curve and Hurst weakly struck out, turning then to discuss it with 
home plate umpire Doug Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
"I was telling the umpire that Witt shouldn't have thrown me a curve, that it 
was cheating," said Hurst, who models his batting stance after Boston star Wade 
Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
People were more impressed with Hurst's pitching. To wit: 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gwynn: "Hurst was just dealing, putting the ball where he wanted. I 
haven't seen that from a left-hander around here in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Pitching coach Pat Dobson: "You can just tell, he knows how to pitch. He was 
locating everything, which this early in the spring is something." 
</P>
<P>
People were also awed by Hurst's speed. He made the 3 1/2-hour drive to Phoenix 
in 2 1/2 hours Thursday afternoon to watch close friend Danny Ainge play for 
the Sacramento Kings in a game against the Phoenix Suns before returning to 
Yuma just as quickly that same night. 
</P>
<P>
"Lot of lonely cactuses flying by out there," Hurst said. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson would not say he's changing his unofficial choice for the Opening Day 
starting pitcher -- it's still Eric Show -- but he will be watching Show 
closer, beginning with Show's first spring start Sunday. If Show is not 
progressing, look for Hurst to sneak in for the regular season's first start. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
It took new announcer Rick Monday all of one Padre radio broadcast to catch a 
mouthful of foot. During the middle of his first play-by-play inning Friday, he 
was joined in the booth by Padre owner Joan Kroc and San Diego Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor. After interviewing Kroc, Monday was suddenly asked to introduce 
O'Connor, with whom he had yet to be introduced. He was slipped a piece of 
paper from fellow announcer Jerry Coleman reading, "Mayor," so Monday promptly 
said, "We'd like to welcome the mayor of Yuma . . . " After his foul-up was 
immediately corrected, he rebounded with, "It's really been nice working for 
you, Mrs. Kroc." . . . In Friday's morning B game, played in 25 m.p.h. winds 
that turned Desert Sun Stadium into a sandstorm, the Padres fell to the Angels, 
4-2, in seven innings in a game that featured the pro debut of Jim Abbott, the 
Angels' top draft choice who has one hand. In three innings he allowed no runs, 
two hits and no walks. He struck out four and earned the respect of the Padres. 
"At first you watch what he does with his glove, but then you learn to just 
watch where the ball is coming from," Carmelo Martinez said. "If you don't, 
he's got you." In that same game, Martinez was involved, for the second time 
this spring, in the Great Third Base Experiment. Once again, he made it look 
good. He made a good pickup of a slow roller for one out, made a good play on a 
rundown for another out, and then was in the middle of a double play on another 
rundown. Lest you think Martinez is winning a job at third, in his first A game 
today, he will be back in left field. "I don't know what to say," Martinez 
said, shrugging. "If I told you I felt comfortable out there, I would be lying, 
and I don't lie. It's going to take a lot more than this to make me 
comfortable. But better to learn now than the regular season." Martinez 
admitted for the first time Friday that while learning third base, he must 
fight the urge to ignore his hitting, which would defeat the Padres' purpose. 
"It's what happened when I moved from first base to left field, I worried so 
much about fielding that I don't think about hitting," he said. "That hurt me. 
I can't do that now." He's obviously not worrying too much yet, as he was the 
only Padre to have two hits in the B game. . . . With most of the off-the-field 
attention here still focused on Atlanta scout Wes Westrum, who is searching for 
Padre prospects worthy of a trade for Braves slugger Dale Murphy, few noticed 
Saturday's appearance of Seattle Mariner scout Bob Harrison. But increasingly, 
there is a better chance of the Padres dealing catching prospect Sandy Alomar 
Jr. to the Mariners in a deal that might involve Mariner third baseman Jim 
Presley, outfielder Mickey Brantley and reliever Mike Schooler. There is even 
the chance that Mariner pitcher Mark Langston could be in the deal.

THIS DOWNEY COLUMN HAD NO PLACE IN SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am shocked and amazed at the senselessness and duplicity of Mike Downey's 
"Having a Field Day" column. It had absolutely nothing to do with the world of 
sports; and was a self-serving and misguided attempt at satire, fueled in large 
part by the womanizing of two politicians and a preacher. 
</P>
<P>
It simply failed to make any point whatsoever, except to disparage women and to 
demonstrate Downey's lack of creativity and reliance on tired sexual innuendo. 
All this from a writer who criticized the swimsuit edition as having no place 
in sports.

NATURALLY, READERS TAKE RIPS AT GARVEY

<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Garvey, who has recently impregnated two women while marrying a third, 
stated that, "I'll live up to my moral obligations, which I feel strongly about 
because I'm a Christian." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently he feels that meeting his financial obligation to the children is 
tantamount to meeting his moral obligation to them. 
</P>
<P>
He struck out on this one. But perhaps some good will come of this. Maybe 
Californians will finally see Garvey for the sanctimonious phony he always has 
been.

If Scott Ostler really needs to keep tabs on sports news, I suggest he skip 
Sports Illustrated and invest in a magazine without glossy pages and lots of 
advertisements. You get more sports and less skin that way.

KINGS HAVE NO DEFENSE FOR THEIR POOR DEFENSE

Once again, the Kings have made the trade (they think) will bring the Stanley 
Cup to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
I think that's seven years in a row now!

<P>
Rogie Vachon should know, better than anyone else, what makes a goaltender and 
his team successful: defense. 
</P>
<P>
A goaltender is only as good as the people playing in front of him. 
Unfortunately for the Kings' goaltenders, the people in front of them are 
really good. The problem is that they are always wearing the wrong jerseys.

I cannot find one good reason that Mitch (Blood) Green continues to attract

VALLEY WOMEN STOP FULLERTON TO EARN BERTH IN TITLE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH NICHOLS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Valley College center Ruth Aguilar has taken on a new and unwanted role in the 
state junior college women's basketball championships -- that of spectator. 
</P>
<P>
Plagued by persistent foul trouble the past two games, Aguilar has not been the 
offensive power that she had been all season. But Aguilar was on the court when 
it counted Friday night, scoring 10 points in the second half to key a comeback 
and lead the Lady Monarchs to a 70-69 semifinal victory over top-ranked 
Fullerton College at Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Valley (31-3) will play American River College (28-4), a 53-51 winner over 
College of the Sequoias, in the championship game at 7 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not playing well in the first half, but we showed the kind of 
character this team has and the leadership that Ruth provides," Valley Coach 
Doug Michelson said of the comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar, limited to seven points in Valley's quarterfinal victory over College 
of San Mateo, had 14 points against Fullerton, which lost for the first time in 
19 games. Despite her consistent foul trouble, Aguilar is confident that her 
team can fill in whenever she is on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating, but I know that anybody on this team can come in and take my 
spot," Aguilar said. "I don't care how long I play as long as my team is doing 
the job." 
</P>
<P>
Behind Aguilar and Christine Rumfola -- who had a game-high 22 points -- Valley 
outscored Fullerton, 37-30, in the second half to eliminate the Hornets (27-2). 
</P>
<P>
Sandrine Rocher added 20 points for Valley, which has won 15 games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore guard Debbie Wagner paced Fullerton in the first half with five 
three-point baskets and the Hornets used a flurry of three-point baskets midway 
through the half to break in front. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman guard Tisa Rush tied the score, 12-12, on a three-point shot with 
13:40 left before the Hornets made three three-point baskets in a row to go 
ahead, 21-12. Valley cut Fullerton's lead to 35-33 with less than a minute left 
in the half, but the Hornets scored four consecutive points to go back in front 
by six at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar, who had three first-half fouls, scored two baskets and Rumfola added 
three as Valley used a 12-2 run at the start of the second half to go ahead, 
45-41. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we lost it in the first eight minutes of the second half," Fullerton 
Coach Colleen Riley said. "They made about four straight baskets and we had to 
play from behind." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton closed to within a point several times in the last three minutes. 
Freshman forward Kelli Johnson, who led Fullerton with 21 points, scored with 
51 seconds left to pull the Hornets to within 68-67, but Shagarro Lattin 
answered 18 seconds later to give Valley a 70-67 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets did not make another field goal. Guard Lisa Crosskey hit two free 
throws with no time remaining, but Valley already had clinched the win. 
</P>
<P>
American River also advanced to the final with a dramatic second-half comeback. 
Freshman Samantha Uding made a six-foot jump shot with a second left to send 
the Beavers to the championship game for the second time in the past three 
years.

HART GIRLS LOCK UP 5-A TITLE WITH ROUT OF SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Had there been a fat lady at Cal Poly Pomona on Friday night the singing would 
have commenced early and lasted throughout the evening. 
</P>
<P>
The singing -- and quite likely the subsequent celebrating -- in fact, did. 
</P>
<P>
The crescendo was Hart High's 63-49 rout of Santa Barbara in the Southern 
Section 5-A Division championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Hart's fans, who packed one-quarter of the spacious gym, began chanting early 
and were singing, "Hey, hey, goodby" in the fourth quarter although several 
minutes remained. 
</P>
<P>
Their mirth was warranted. The title is Hart's first since the program's 
inception in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't sunk in yet," said Coach Pam Walker, who guided the Indians (25-2) 
to their first Foothill League championship and 15 consecutive wins to finish 
the season. "I don't think it's hit any of us. When we wake up tomorrow, 
everyone will have a smile on their face . . . if we ever go to bed tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The Indians, seeded No. 2, put Santa Barbara to bed early, leaping to a 7-1 
lead and steadily increasing it. 
</P>
<P>
Hart led, 22-11, after one quarter and, 38-22, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
A balanced attack, Hart's hallmark this season, checked a 25-point effort by 
Santa Barbara guard Faha Banks, a former summer player for Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Junior forward Sara Wilson, Hart's leading scorer, had 18 points to lead the 
Indians. Guards Desa Pecel added 15 points -- nine in the fourth quarter -- and 
Kim Posey had 12. 
</P>
<P>
"Play like a team, win like a team," Walker said. "Everybody shined. It's the 
best way to win a title." 
</P>
<P>
Only four players scored for Santa Barbara (21-8). In the fourth quarter, which 
began and ended with Hart ahead by 14, Banks (eight points) and fellow guard 
Nicole Barr (six) accounted for all of the Dons' points. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach told us before the game that Faha was the key factor," said Pecel, who 
drilled four long-distance jump shots. "We held her." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara launched only two minor threats, the first in the third quarter 
when Kristin Knapp, a 6-foot-3 junior center who finished with 15 points, made 
a jump shot and Banks made a layup and a jump shot to cut Hart's lead to 44-33. 
Hart closed the period with a 5-2 run, however. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Banks made a steal and a layup with 2:48 to play to cut 
the Indians' lead to 57-47 -- their smallest since 19-11. 
</P>
<P>
Hart, however, then took the only timeout it required in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to play like we're 10 points down all the time," Walker said. "It 
didn't seem like it came easily. I don't think anyone was looking at the 
scoreboard. I know I wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Hart emerged from the timeout and Pecel made a baseline jump shot. Wilson 
followed with two free throws to give the Indians a 61-47 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
With 12 seconds to play, Hart's entire grandstand entourage was delivering a 
standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
Roses from well-wishers seasoned the postgame celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like I say the same thing after every game," Wilson said. "But I just 
can't explain this feeling. I can't put it into words." 
</P>
<P>
Walker, who is in her fourth season at Hart, had an easier time. 
</P>
<P>
"That you can set a goal and get beyond the obstacles to achieve it is a great 
feeling," she said. "It kind of makes you believe in the American Dream."

HALCOVICH FILLS HART PITCHING NEEDS IN A 14-0 WIN OVER JORDAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When All-Southern Section pitcher Jason Edwards went down earlier this week 
with a sore shoulder, the Hart High baseball team could have gone down with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
But because Keith Halcovich has offered a shoulder to lean on, Edwards' 
shoulder hasn't been cried on. 
</P>
<P>
Halcovich yielded only five singles in his first varsity start as Hart defeated 
Long Beach Jordan, 14-0, at Hart on Friday in the first round of the El Segundo 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Halcovich, a 6-foot-5 sophomore starting in Edwards' place, struck out three of 
the first four batters he faced and six in the game and did not allow a walk. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a great job tonight," Hart assistant Pete Calzia said. "He had a big 
performance. He knew we don't have a number one pitcher anymore and he came out 
and did a number one job." 
</P>
<P>
Halcovich's timing could not have been better. According to Calzia, Edwards 
could have bone chips or a pulled or strained tendon in his shoulder. Edwards 
worked 82 innings for Hart and a Colt League team that won the World Series 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"His arm is tired," Calzia said. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, whose injury doesn't hinder his batting, will visit a shoulder 
specialist Thursday, Calzia said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be surprised if he gets clearance," Coach Bud Murray said. "He'll 
be back. He'll be back unless they cut his arm off." 
</P>
<P>
Hart scored 10 runs in the first three innings on eight hits and seven walks. 
Edwards, starting at designated-hitter, knocked in two runs with a double and 
Jay Sanford, Lance Migita and Casey Burrill each added run-scoring singles in 
Hart's six-run third inning. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Halcovich baffled Jordan with his changeup and fastball and faced 
only 18 batters in the first five innings. Halcovich allowed two hits in the 
sixth but escaped without giving up a run. 
</P>
<P>
Hart loaded the bases in the first inning after two quick outs and Chris 
Vasquez sent Jordan center fielder Roger Neal to the wall with the apparent 
third out. But Neal dropped the ball at the wall, allowing three runs to score. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kinda nervous but the three runs in the first took a lot of pressure off 
me," Halcovich said.

SIMI VALLEY FALLS IN SOCCER FINAL TO CAPISTRANO VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Capistrano Valley High was looking for revenge and Simi Valley was looking for 
a title when the schools met in the Southern Section 4-A girls' soccer 
championship Friday. But the Cougars walked away with both after an overtime 
victory at Gahr High in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars edged Simi Valley, 4-3, to more than make up for a one-goal loss to 
the Pioneers in December. Cougar forward Rebeca Linhart, double-teamed by Simi 
Valley defenders Shannon Cunningham and Tammi Kauffman, broke loose to score 
the game-winning goal from five yards with two minutes remaining in the extra 
period. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a bit of a revenge game," Capistrano Valley Coach Steve Bignal said. 
"(But) it doesn't matter who we would have played. We wanted to play as well as 
we could against anyone." 
</P>
<P>
The teams that met Friday weren't the same ones that squared off in the 
previous meeting, however. Simi Valley, for instance, was without the services 
of Michelle Light, a junior halfback who suffered a knee injury in a 
quarterfinal playoff victory over Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
That left the scoring duties to fullback Kim Taketa, who almost saved the day 
for Simi Valley. Taketa found the upper-right corner of the Capistrano Valley 
net from 20 yards to tie the score, 3-3, with 12 minutes remaining in 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley opened the scoring when striker Maureen Durmmy booted a shot 
into the middle of the net from two yards at the 22-minute mark. Simi Valley 
had a chance to tie the score, but Capistrano Valley goalkeeper Suzy Bone made 
a diving save on Tania Tande's shot from 20 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars boosted their advantage to 2-0 on a goal by midfielder Ginger Frank 
with four minutes left in the first half. But four minutes was all the Pioneers 
needed to cut the lead in half. Halfback Stephanie Gainey directed a head shot 
beyond the reach of Bone on an assist from Taketa with 15 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers (24-3-2) tied the score, 2-2, 14 minutes into the second half when 
freshman forward Amy Hunter's shot from 15 yards caromed off the crossbar, 
hitting halfback Gina Skinner in the chest before dropping across the goal 
line. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take Capistrano Valley (23-5-1) long to regain the lead. Linhart, 
dribbling downfield on a breakaway, went one-on-one with Simi Valley goalkeeper 
Kim Duran and placed a shot into the lower-left corner of the net for a 3-2 
lead after 58 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The loss caught Simi Valley Coach Mark Johnson off guard. "I really thought we 
were going to win the game," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley, the South Coast League champion, controlled the pace early 
in the match but Simi Valley, runner-up in the Marmonte League, began to exert 
itself just before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley finished the opening 40 minutes with 10 shots on goal, most coming 
in the final 10 minutes of the period. The Pioneers directed 23 shots on goal 
in the match. 
</P>
<P>
Taketa's goal was her 19th, a team high.

BIRMINGHAM LEAVES BLOCKS IN BIG WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After guiding Poly High to seven East Valley League track titles in the past 
eight years, Coach Scott King came to Birmingham in September with a reputation 
as a winner. 
</P>
<P>
If Birmingham's 110-16 romp over Grant in a Valley Pac-8 Conference opener 
Friday is an indication, King could be headed for another championship season. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Rodney Burt and Brian Gastelum, the Braves won 14 of 15 events, 
including every running event. 
</P>
<P>
Burt, fifth in the 400 in last year's City Section championships, won the 100 
in 11.1 seconds and the 200 in 22.8. He also anchored the Braves' 400-meter 
relay team to victory in 45.5. 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum, a junior, won the 1,600 meters in 4 minutes, 36.5 seconds and the 
3,200 in 10:35.0. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Steve Weinberger added victories in the long jump (20-2) and the 
triple jump (37-3). 
</P>
<P>
In other boys' meets: 
</P>
<P>
Taft 67, San Fernando 63 -- The Tigers won seven of 13 individual events, but 
Taft's superior depth prevailed in the Northwest Valley Conference opener at 
Taft. 
</P>
<P>
Howard McCrary and Ibed Aguirre were double winners for San Fernando. McCrary 
won the 110-meter high hurdles in 15.5 and the 330-yard intermediate hurdles in 
47.5. Aguirre, fourth in last year's City cross-country championships, ran 
4:51.3 in the mile and 10:00.0 in the two-mile run. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Hart led Taft with win in 100 meters (11.2) and 220 yards (23.7). Hart 
also ran on Hart's victorious 440 relay (46.0). 
</P>
<P>
Other top performances were turned in by Taft's Cornell Hill in the high jump 
(6-2) and San Fernando's Sean Williams in the long jump (20-3). 
</P>
<P>
Monroe 71, North Hollywood 51 -- Chris Harvey and Mario Armijo each won two 
events for Monroe in the Valley Pac-8 Conference opener at home. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey won the 100 meters in 11.4 seconds and the 220 yards in 23.4 and 
anchored the 440 relay in 45.4. Armijo won the 110-meter high hurdles in 16.6 
and the 330-yard intermediates in 42.7. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Derril White-Fleming won the long jump at 20-3. 
</P>
<P>
GIRLS 
</P>
<P>
Taft 64, San Fernando 43 -- Sophomore Jane Kim won three events for Taft in the 
Northwest Valley Conference opener at Taft. 
</P>
<P>
Kim won the 220-yard dash in 28.7, the 100-meter low hurdles in 17.3 and the 
long jump at 15-4. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore teammate Sarah White won the high jump at 4-10. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham 63, Grant 46 -- The Braves' dominance of the distance events powered 
them to victory in the Valley Pac-8 Conference opener at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Heather Ballard won the 800 in 2:31.0 and senior Cheri-Lee Segal was 
victorious in the 1,600 (5:43.1) and 3,200 (12:36.0). 
</P>
<P>
Another Birmingham freshman, Montoya Johnson, won the 400 in 65.1. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood 61, Monroe 41 -- The Vikings dominated the sprints, but North 
Hollywood won both relays and swept the distance events in the Valley Pac-8 
Conference opener at Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
Kynna Wright won the 100 meters (13.1) and 440 yards (1:10.3) for Monroe, and 
teammate Tamika Stewart won the 220 yards in 27.8. 
</P>
<P>
However, Joy Preston (880) and Shelby Serpa (mile and two-mile) won events for 
North Hollywood.

HUNTER, COOK ADVANCE TO SEMIFINAL ROUND OF STATE WRESTLING FINALS

<P>
Any good wrestler has to have goals, and Westlake High's Bill Hunter is a good 
wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, a junior, came into this weekend's state wrestling championships at 
University of the Pacific seeking to make a name for himself. 
</P>
<P>
How's this one?: semifinalist. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter defeated Al Martell of Mount Carmel on Friday in the quarterfinals of 
the 175-pound weight class. Even Hunter was surprised after felling Martell, 
who came into the state meet ranked No. 1 at 175 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I had some high hopes coming into this thing," Hunter said. "But I really 
wasn't shooting for this high." 
</P>
<P>
The day did not begin quite as auspiciously for Hunter, who narrowly defeated 
Overfelt's Richard Garcia, 4-3, in the first round. Hunter then buried 
Monache's Ryan Land, 11-0, in the second round to set up his quarterfinal match 
with Martell. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter led throughout the quarterfinal match, opening the scoring on a takedown 
in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason, I think he quit after that first takedown," Hunter said. "I 
could feel it. I think he was even more surprised than me at what was 
happening. He's probably never heard of me." 
</P>
<P>
And probably won't soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
The only other Valley-area wrestler to advance to the semifinals was Rob Cook 
of Rio Mesa in the 132-pound division. Cook opened with a 12-point victory in 
the first round, followed with a pin the second and scored a 6-1 victory over 
North Bakersfield's Joe Cemo in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Two came close to advancing. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Kilbane of Newbury Park was undone in the final 10 seconds of his 
quarterfinal match against Eric Miklusicak in the 154-pound weight class. 
Kilbane, who won his first two matches by a combined score of 26-6, trailed 
virtually the entire match. He was behind, 7-3, late in the second period and, 
9-6, midway through the third. 
</P>
<P>
Kilbane rallied to take a brief 10-9 lead on a reversal with less than 20 
seconds remaining. But Miklusicak quickly countered with a reversal of his own 
and won the match, 11-10. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had it," Newbury Park Coach Marty Maciel said. "At worst I 
thought it would go to overtime." 
</P>
<P>
Another heartbreaking loss was incurred by Channel Islands' M. T. Merickel, who 
was leading Vallejo's Dominic Boutan, 5-4, late in their 126-pound second-round 
match when he was turned and pinned.

UNDEFEATED AGOURA GIRLS ON BRINK OF 3-A SOCCER TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Godwin must be wondering what is in store for him as his Agoura High 
girls' soccer team prepares to play Anaheim Canyon for the Southern Section 3-A 
Division championship this afternoon at 2 at Gahr High in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Godwin, the Agoura coach, last month announced his resignation effective at the 
end of the season. Under Godwin, Agoura has won the past two 2-A titles. 
</P>
<P>
This season, having been elevated to the 3-A level, the No. 1-seeded Chargers 
are 25-0. A victory today would bring Godwin's five-year record to 102-7-9 and 
undoubtedly warrant cause for celebration. And that has become cause for 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year I got hit in the face with a cream pie," Godwin said. "It was a 
perfect shot. I don't know what's going to happen should we be fortunate enough 
to win." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers certainly are good enough to win. Agoura has won 40 consecutive 
matches and has outscored the opposition this season, 170-6, establishing a 
Southern Section single-season record for goals. Junior Heidi Walters has 
scored a team-high 29 goals and senior Julie Tingle is the Southern Section 
career assist leader with 103. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-seeded Canyon (18-1-4), however, is not likely to be intimidated. The 
Comanches, the Century League champions, have recorded playoff wins over 
third-seeded Moreno Valley (1-0) and second-seeded Mater Dei (4-1). 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone I talk to says Agoura is awesome," Coach John Williams said. "But 
we're used to being the underdogs." 
</P>
<P>
Senior striker Christa Ramirez leads Canyon with 22 goals. Senior goalkeeper 
Keri Erkenbrack has yielded only two goals in the past 12 matches. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the City Section girls' soccer season will conclude today at 
Birmingham High with an all-Valley final when Chatsworth meets Grant at noon. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth breezed to the Northwest Conference championship and is unbeaten -- 
with one tie -- in 16 matches. Grant finished second to Chatsworth in the 
conference and is 12-2-3.

SAN PASQUAL WINS FOURTH TITLE IN ROW

San Pasqual High School overcame a tentative first half to defeat Avocado 
League rival Ramona, 1-0, Friday night at Torrey Pines High School to win its 
fourth consecutive San Diego Section girls' 2-A soccer championship. 
</P>
<P>
The only difference in the Golden Eagles' fourth title was their opponent. San 
Pasqual defeated the University of San Diego High School to win its three 
previous titles. This time it defeated Ramona for the third time this season. 
But it wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted it so bad but they didn't want to make a mistake," San Pasqual 
Coach Bill Bullock said. "Four years in a row is kind of unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take San Pasqual long to score in the second half as Cathy Stark 
scored on at 36:37. 
</P>
<P>
Stark picked the ball up in the middle of the field and then hooked it from 
right-to-left and rolled it into the corner of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told Nikki (Gannon) to give it to me," Stark said. "I just wanted to 
put it low and in the corner. I watched to see how far the goalie would come 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Ramona had several opportunities to score in the second half as play became 
more aggressive. But the Bulldogs could not convert on any of their corner-kick 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual played much more aggressively in the second half, especially after 
Stark's goal, and was on the attack most of the half. 
</P>
<P>
"It psychs you up and it gives you a second wind," Stark said. "We were a 
little over confident in the first half, I think." 
</P>
<P>
Defense dominated the first half as neither team had any serious scoring 
threats. Ramona kept the ball in its half most of the first half, but could not 
score. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual did, however, have two runaway attempts that were thwarted by 
Ramona defender Genetta Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Monica Degn had control of the ball and ran down the right side, but Johnson 
rode her out of bounds and did not give her an angle on the goal.

SYNBIOTICS REPORTS $1.2-MILLION LOSS FOR THIRD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Synbiotics, which in January reported the loss of a licensing agreement with a 
major pharmaceutical company, on Friday reported a $1.2-million net loss for 
the third quarter ended Dec. 31. Synbiotics reported a $41,000 net profit 
during the previous third quarter. Revenue for the quarter fell to $887,000 
from $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Synbiotics reported a $1.9-million net loss for the nine-month period, 
contrasted with a $328,000 net profit during the corresponding period the year 
before. Revenue for the nine-month period rose by 10% to $5.5 million, up from 
$5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a difficult quarter for the company," acknowledged Synbiotics 
President and Chief Executive Edward T. Maggio. 
</P>
<P>
The loss followed the Jan. 30 announcement that SmithKline Diagnostics had 
canceled a $1.7-million contract with Synbiotics to develop and license 
diagnostic products for the physician's office. The contract was expected to 
bolster Synbiotics' revenue by as much as $30 million during a five-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sales Costs Up 
</P>
<P>
The quarterly loss was driven largely by sales costs that rose by 121%, to 
$237,000. Product sales to cover those costs failed to materialize after 
SmithKline Diagnostics canceled the contract, Synbiotics Vice President Martin 
Nash said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Synbiotics' loss also was attributed to research-and-development costs that 
rose 178%, to $545,000, for the fourth quarter and 134%, to $1.2 million, for 
the nine months ended Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Those increased costs were driven by two veterinary therapeutic products that 
are entering clinical trials that, if successful, will lead to product sales in 
1991. "It's sort of a good news/bad news situation," Nash said. "We wouldn't be 
incurring the costs if we weren't close to a product launch." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Long, Grinding Process' 
</P>
<P>
The quarterly loss was "wider than I was looking for," according to Kenneth 
Bohringer, a New York-based analyst with Prudential Bache. "But, in this 
industry, product development is known to be a long, grinding process." 
</P>
<P>
"The key investment consideration for me is whether Synbiotics can successfully 
launch the two veterinary products in 1991," Bohringer said. "The other 
consideration is if they have sufficient capital to get by in the interim." 
</P>
<P>
Synbiotics' cash flow has "not been as good as the typical investor might like 
because the company has been sustaining losses," Bohringer said. "However, they 
have considerable capital to work with, and they have been using it up rather 
gradually." 
</P>
<P>
The Rancho Bernardo-based company had $17.1 million in cash Dec. 31, down from 
$21.7 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Made Money 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tough business," Nash acknowledged. "And several biotech companies 
that lack strong balance sheets are for sale right now," said Nash, who 
maintained that Synbiotics "has a strong balance sheet -- and we were 
profitable during the past two years." 
</P>
<P>
Losing the SmithKline Diagnostics contract was "a disappointment, not a 
disaster," Bohringer said. "It obviously was not a piece of good news for the 
company, but it doesn't at all affect Synbiotics' two (veterinary products) 
that evidently will be introduced to the market in 1991." 
</P>
<P>
Synbiotics expects to have those two therapeutic products -- one for a major 
feline disorder, the other for canine heart worm -- by 1991 at the latest, Nash 
said. "Hopefully, we'll still have the lead on the rest of the world," Nash 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to those monoclonal antibody-based veterinary products, Synbiotics 
plans to eventually enter the market for human diagnostic and therapeutic 
products. Nash on Friday maintained that the development of human therapeutic 
products was not hurt by the SmithKline Diagnostics cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Quite Disappointed' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not denying that we were quite disappointed by the cancellation," Nash 
said. But the monoclonal antibody technology is still at the core of the 
company's technology, he said, "and that wasn't affected by the cancellation." 
</P>
<P>
The SmithKline contract represented a "quite nice way to absorb overhead 
costs," Nash said. Synbiotics' licensing agreement evidently was lost in the 
shuffle during extensive management changes at SmithKline, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very frustrating but very amicable parting," Nash said. "The 
president of the (SmithKline Diagnostics) unit and the group president above 
him were both fired and replaced by two new guys. One of them acknowledged that 
he'd never even heard of our company."

SHAW'S DEVILISH 'YOU NEVER CAN TELL' AT SCR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"You Never Can Tell"? 
</P>
<P>
Pshaw -- of course you can. "You Never Can Tell" is early Shaw (1897), and it 
has been mounted at South Coast Repertory. With that kind of pedigree, it 
almost goes without saying that it will be impeccably staged, in the tradition 
of the award-winning "Misalliance" (1987). 
</P>
<P>
The play itself is not exactly unpredictable, either. It's hardly violating a 
trust to say that the two young people who are attracted to each other will 
score debating points at the other's expense but will wind up in each other's 
arms. Nor is it surprising that the women in this play are tougher than their 
mates, nor that the Life Force can overcome the most reasoned arguments and the 
stuffiest demeanors. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it's no news flash that all of this adds up to a lot of devilish fun. 
</P>
<P>
Excerpts from an essay by Margery M. Morgan, reprinted in the South Coast 
newsletter, point out that "You Never Can Tell" was quasi-autobiographical. Yet 
it is so unlike the early quasi-autobiographical scribblings of most fledgling 
playwrights. Shaw appraised all of his characters judiciously, without a trace 
of rancor. Despite the snappy comebacks and bursts of temper that dot the 
dialogue, it remains a gentle play. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it lacks the philosophical tirades that crop up in Shaw's later 
work. There isn't an ounce of preachiness here. As a result, the play can seem 
as lightweight as the magnificently fluffy clouds that Cliff Faulkner designed 
for this production -- and it is lighter than, say, "Misalliance." 
</P>
<P>
But it's hardly a vacuum. Moments of genuine human feeling peer up through its 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the story is the 18-year-old breakup of a family. The father, 
Fergus Crampton (John-David Keller) is, as his name implies, a grouch, and 
apparently he used to be something worse. Whatever he did back then, his wife 
(Sally Kemp) took the three children, a new name (Mrs. Clandon) and her 
self-respect and fled to Madeira, where she has become famous for writing 
thoroughly modern tomes on the coming century. 
</P>
<P>
Her oldest child, the very grown-up Gloria (Sally Spencer) hopes to become the 
role model for 20th-Century women that her mother has prescribed. But the two 
younger kids (Jennifer Flackett and Daniel Bright), technically almost grown, 
remain carefree imps who make fun of their mother's fondest aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
When the family returns to England, a chance visit to the young dentist 
Valentine (Tom Harrison) results in a reunion with choleric old Dad, who 
happens to be Valentine's landlord. It also results in a rush of romance 
between Valentine and Gloria. 
</P>
<P>
Old man Crampton is initially horrified by his brood, but paternal feelings 
brew in the strangest places, and soon he's threatening to sue for custody of 
the younger children. This doesn't seem particularly likely, but Shaw wrote 
around it and other improbabilities with his usual skill. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute is mediated by a couple of solicitors (Don Took and John-Frederick 
Jones) and the grandly beneficent waiter (I. M. Hobson) at the seaside resort 
where it all takes place. Meanwhile, everyone takes a turn at advancing or 
trying to stop the apparent misalliance between Valentine, the penniless 
dentist, and Gloria, the dignified feminist. 
</P>
<P>
The performances glitter. Inducing the most giggles is that comic peanut 
gallery of Flackett and Bright; costumer Shigeru Yaji really outdid himself 
with Bright's big green cravat over a white dandy outfit. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other nominally subsidiary performances are among the showiest. 
After merely four roles at South Coast, Hobson's eyebrows should be enshrined 
in the lobby. And Jones' one scene is a comic blitzkrieg. 
</P>
<P>
But it's the twinkle in the eye of Harrison, the solemn gravity of Kemp and 
Spencer and the first-act crabbiness of Keller that really holds the production 
together. Plus, of course, the authoritative directing by David Emmes. 
</P>
<P>
The staging of a first-act luncheon is especially well-done. Keller carves away 
at his food while everyone else offers a toast. Took tries earnestly to 
transcend his revulsion at the younger generation seated next to him. Hobson, 
whom no one would ever confuse with a ballet dancer, moves around the table 
with exquisite grace, a platonic ideal of the perfect waiter. 
</P>
<P>
Besides those aforementioned clouds, Faulkner's set includes a lovely seaside 
solarium that doubles as a dentist's office and then converts into a hotel 
terrace and a fashionable sitting room. Peter Maradudin's lighting design keeps 
the stage soaked in summery hues. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole world is like a feather dancing in the light," says Valentine. This 
production makes you believe it. 
</P>

SHER'S 'THE NEST' HATCHES GOOD REVIEW FROM NEW YORK CRITIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local director Bartlett Sher just received his first New York review and 
describes himself as "relieved" that the New York Times liked his work on "The 
Nest," which closes Sunday at off-Broadway's Perry Street Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Sher, who is not one to bow to any kind of authority, hurried to clarify his 
statement. "Actually, I could care less," he explained. "But I'm relieved for 
the artistic institution and the actors." 
</P>
<P>
The artistic institution is the New York Theatre Workshop (NYTW), which chose 
Sher as one of three in its New Directors Project scheduled to make their 
off-Broadway directing debuts this year. Sher, an instructor at San Diego State 
University and artistic director of the Plus Fire Performance Group, was the 
first winner to be selected from San Diego. According to James C. Nicola, NYTW 
artistic director, a close runner-up was Scott Feldsher, artistic director of 
the local Sledgehammer Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Critic Mel Gussow, the only reviewer to write about the show to date, first 
lavished praise on the play itself, which tells the story of a blue-collar 
couple taking extra jobs to support a coming baby, only to find that one of 
those jobs -- dumping toxic wastes -- ends up poisoning their child. 
</P>
<P>
He praised Sher for showing the couple as "a portrait of contentment, but with 
a gentle edge of self-parody"; he particularly liked Sher's innovative use of a 
real 8-month-old baby who "meets every cue and is never at a loss for silence." 
</P>
<P>
Rob Murphy's "crisp" setting and Roger Downey's "conversational" translation of 
the Franz Zaver Kroetz play also drew approval. Sher, who had worked with both 
Murphy and Downey in San Diego, brought them both in on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy designed the set for Sher's production of "The Strong Breed" as well as 
the La Jolla Playhouse's "The Fool Show" and the San Diego Repertory Theatre's 
"Six Women With Brain Death or Expiring Minds Want to Know." Downey translated 
"Lulu" and "Figaro Gets a Divorce" at the La Jolla Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times ran Gussow's article Thursday, four days after opening 
night. Now Sher is back in town, teaching at SDSU and wondering, he said, "if 
anyone in San Diego will hire me to do anything again now that I've worked in 
New York." 
</P>
<P>
He said he would love to restage "The Nest" here, but, for now, his only plans 
are to work with his wife, Carla Kirkwood, on staging "Maria on Highway 94," 
the opening production for Sushi Gallery's Neofest in April. The next play Sher 
will direct is "The Wakefield Mystery Cycle" at the University of Leeds in 
London in May.

CAT AND THE AYATOLLAH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Khomeini does not represent me as a Muslim; he is the leader of the Shia 
minority, often self-righteous and misguided in their interpretation of Islamic 
law. 
</P>
<P>
His threat against Rushdie is wrong, and, I think, actually illegal, 
Islamically speaking. 
</P>
<P>
But Rushdie knew exactly what he was doing in savagely attacking truths all 
Muslims hold dear. My objection to Charles Champlin's article ("The Rushdie 
Affair -- a View From the Sidelines," Feb. 23) is this: Muslims have rules of 
civilized conduct, in which blasphemy is punishable; to defend the West as 
having defined the rules of civilized conduct for the entire world is 
hypocritical if one means to say that the West is superior in such matters.

FIDELIO'S JOURNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thoughts inspired by Martin Bernheimer's Feb. 16 review of "Fidelio" as 
produced by the San Diego Opera Company: 
</P>
<P>
Since I moved to Orange County 18 months ago, I have seen two performances at 
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, "La Cenerentola" and "Macbeth." La Cenerentola 
turned up as Alice in Wonderland with a little girl wandering around the stage 
for no reason discernable to me, and "Macbeth" was a kabuki drama. So learning 
that Fidelio had moved from 17th-Century Spain to 1989 Central America comes as 
no surprise. So what if Beethoven loses out in the end? He's dead (as are 
Rossini and Verdi) and can't really complain.

ROBIN GIVENS SCORES SPLIT DECISION IN 'PENTHOUSE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's be serious: The only public interest in "The Penthouse," airing Sunday at 
9 p.m. on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42), is to figure if Robin Givens could be 
a contender. 
</P>
<P>
The onetime sparring partner for champion Mike Tyson may have heavyweight 
pretensions as star of a psychodrama about a young woman, Dinah, being held 
captive in her golden penthouse apartment by a childhood pal, Joey (played by 
David Hewlett). He has since turned demented and hallucinates that he forever 
loves Dinah and vice versa. And they can be always together by hurling 
themselves off the building. 
</P>
<P>
Shaky logic -- and Dinah begins to anguish over the possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Dinah's wealthy record-executive father (Robert Guillaume) likewise anguishes. 
As do the police, who are stymied by explosives that block the stairwell and by 
the security guard, whose dead body clogs the elevator. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not very anguishing for us, what with lightweight direction (by David 
Greene) that plods along and a flyweight script (by William Wood and Frank De 
Felitta, from Elleston Trevor's novel) that telegraphs its punches. 
</P>
<P>
Fact is that whatever may be going on in Joey's punchy head seldom translates 
to the screen and comes off as easy script device to toss in wherever dramatic 
shtick is needed. Joey grabs the knife or he falls into a trance or he talks 
silly. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Givens, trying to graduate from her "Head of the Class" sitcom, does 
puzzlement, then evolving fear, then growing comprehension of how Joey's 
mucked-up mind works. For what she's called on to do, she does a very credible 
job. She has some good moves, but this is really mostly shadow boxing. 
</P>
<P>
If one were to indulge in analogy from the squared circle, one would score this 
as a split decision. IRV LETOFSKY

OFFICER ADMITS HE ERRED IN REPORT ON VIDEOTAPED ARREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A white Long Beach police officer who allegedly pushed a black man through a 
plate-glass window during an arrest that was secretly videotaped by a 
television crew acknowledged Friday that he made errors in his official report. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Mark Dickey, speaking publicly for the first time since the Jan. 14 
incident, told a state Senate oversight committee in sworn testimony that he 
had so little faith in his own report that he would not want it used against 
him if he were suspected of a crime. He blamed the discrepancies on a faulty 
memory, saying he wrote the report more than three hours after the altercation 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey, who was testifying under subpoena, admitted under questioning that the 
black man, Don Jackson, never used profanity during the arrest as Dickey had 
indicated in his report. Dickey also admitted that he intended to inflict pain 
on Jackson when he put handcuffs on him as a way to control him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Misconduct Allegations 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Daniel Boatwright (D-Concord), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on 
State Procurement and Expenditure Practices, called the hearing into the 
incident to review allegations of police misconduct in Long Beach. The 
legislative committee monitors state funds disbursed to police departments by 
the state Police Officer Standards and Training Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The incident received nationwide attention after a camera hidden in Jackson's 
car videotaped the arrest, during which Dickey swore at Jackson after stopping 
his car for an alleged traffic violation and then appeared to push his head 
through a plate-glass window. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a Hawthorne police sergeant on disability leave and a self-styled 
crusader against police brutality, had gone to Long Beach that night with an 
NBC television crew following in a separate vehicle in what he termed a "sting" 
operation to validate reports of racism and brutality by Long Beach police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Investigations have been launched by the FBI, the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office and the Long Beach Police Department. Dickey has been 
temporarily reassigned to a desk job, and Jackson was charged with interfering 
with a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, Boatwright repeatedly played the videotape while committee 
members and about 50 observers watched on television monitors and Dickey and 
Jackson commented on each scene. 
</P>
<P>
Boatwright questioned whether the car in which Jackson was riding was actually 
weaving -- the stated cause for the traffic stop -- and whether Jackson acted 
aggressively toward the officers, as Dickey said in his report. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Boatwright asked Dickey: "You became the judge, jury and 
executioner as to whether he was challenged to a fight?" 
</P>
<P>
"No," Dickey tersely replied. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey's attorney, Michael Hannon, refused to allow Dickey to answer any more 
questions after nearly three hours of questioning because of what he called the 
"hostile and badgering" nature of the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"This little kangaroo court gives these politicians a chance to run for office. 
Any resemblance between this and a fair hearing is just imaginary," Hannon told 
reporters afterward. "They are taking stuff out of context and just badgering 
him with it." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, under questioning by Boatwright and as the videotape was played, 
Dickey testified that the alleged infraction for which the Jackson car was 
stopped -- crossing the center divider -- occurred before it could be seen on a 
tape shot from the NBC chase vehicle, but he maintained that the tape does show 
Jackson's car weaving slowly within the traffic lane. 
</P>
<P>
Boatwright, standing in front of the television monitor, pointed out that a 
videotape shot from the Jackson car's rear window shows the street lights 
passing by in a consistent pattern -- indicating the car was not weaving. 
Dickey acknowledged that the police car he was driving "was weaving all over, 
too" as it tailed Jackson's car. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, also testifying under subpoena, said that he and Jeff Hill, an 
off-duty federal corrections officer who drove the car, took great care not to 
break traffic laws when they cruised along Pacific Coast Highway in Long Beach. 
He alleged that in addition to pushing his face into the glass, Dickey hurt him 
by bending his fingers while handcuffing him and pushed his face into the hood 
of the police car. Also, Jackson alleged, officers refused three requests to 
loosen his handcuffs as he was taken to the police station. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey's eight-page police report, which was provided to reporters, states that 
Jackson was arrested for saying "offensive words," an allegation that was later 
dropped. But Dickey conceded at the hearing that it was he, not Jackson, who 
uttered obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Taunts Heard 
</P>
<P>
The report states that Jackson challenged the officer to fight, although 
Jackson never is heard taunting the officer on the tape. "There can be a fight 
without a verbal challenge," Dickey said, adding that Jackson's fists were 
clenched at his sides. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey said that he was swearing to try to alleviate his fear. He testified 
that he thought Jackson, who immediately stepped out of the car after it came 
to a halt, might be trying to provide a diversion for an armed partner in the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
He said his actions were an attempt to "accomplish my No. 1 job that night: to 
go home in one piece." 
</P>
<P>
At one point in the proceeding, Boatwright had Dickey and Jackson weighed in an 
attempt to show that Jackson is shorter and weighs less than the officer. 
</P>
<P>
At another point, Boatwright assumed the role of Dickey and had Dickey play 
Jackson in trying to demonstrate the type of hold Dickey used on Jackson during 
the arrest. Boatwright contended that in using that type of hold the officer 
would have had to push Jackson into the window deliberately. Dickey denied it. 
</P>
<P>
The officer said Jackson's face crashed through the window when Jackson 
suddenly pulled forward. Jackson, according to Dickey, struck the window with 
his elbows and not with his face as Jackson contends. Dickey, who cut his hand, 
noted that Jackson suffered no facial injuries when the glass shattered. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, in his testimony, defended his self-appointed role as a police 
anti-brutality activist, saying "my duty is to uphold the law and I am doing 
that in the highest tradition." He said he is troubled, though, that Long Beach 
police are investigating his background on the Hawthorne Police Department 
rather than concentrating on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Boatwright adjourned the hearing, which was held at the Hall of Administration 
in downtown Los Angeles, after about six hours of testimony. He said it would 
reconvene later to hear from the additional witnesses.

 AQMD PLAN WOULD BAN OIL BURNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District adopted a policy Friday that 
would ban the burning of oil by electric utilities in Southern California after 
1996. The policy extends the oil-burning ban to commercial uses after 1997. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous vote formalizes a key part of the district's controversial air 
quality management plan, a sweeping proposal to generally replace fossil fuels 
with clean-burning fuels in the region by the late 1990s. The district ordered 
its staff to begin writing rules to put the ban into effect. 
</P>
<P>
The overall air quality plan, fiercely opposed by industry and utilities, is 
scheduled for a vote March 17. The ban, aimed at electric utilities which use 
oil and natural gas to make electricity, helps "establish a rationale for 
bringing in additional natural gas pipeline capacity to California," said Paul 
Wuebben of the air quality district. 
</P>
<P>
Natural gas shortages have led to the temporary curtailment of gas deliveries 
to electric utilities and other big gas customers three times in the last 14 
months, forcing them to burn oil instead. Oil causes more air pollution than 
natural gas.

 TOUGH SENTENCE FOR GANG GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A street gang member was sentenced Thursday to 130 days in County Jail for 
spray-painting the name of his gang on a house -- a sentence prosecutors said 
was unusually severe for a graffiti charge. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel Angel Gonzalez, 18, a member of the West Side Wilmas, a Wilmington-area 
street gang, was arrested at midnight Feb. 18 near the intersection of 
Wilmington Boulevard and Mar Vista Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Police found him spray-painting his gang's name, "WSW," in three-foot-high 
letters on the side of a house, city attorney's office spokesman Ted Goldstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the jail sentence, San Pedro Municipal Judge Roy Ferkich ordered 
Gonzalez to perform 100 hours of community service and placed him on two years 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein called the sentence "very unusual," noting that graffiti offenders 
usually receive community service sentences and "little to no County Jail 
time."

 NEW HOUSING BOARD PRESIDENT CONFIRMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council peppered former high-ranking federal housing 
official Carl Covitz with sharp questions Friday before confirming his 
appointment to the board that oversees the city's troubled housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 14 to 0 to confirm Mayor Tom Bradley's appointment of Covitz, 
49, a real estate developer and former undersecretary of the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
Covitz, a Westwood resident, replaces the Housing Authority Commission's former 
president, Alvin Greene, who resigned under pressure last December after 
missing meetings for six consecutive months. 
</P>
<P>
The board Covitz will sit on oversees the controversy-wracked Housing 
Authority, which has been assailed for poor management and for allowing the 
city's 21 aging housing projects to fall further into disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
Covitz runs Landmark Communities Inc., a Beverly Hills development firm, and 
serves as chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board of San Francisco.

HOSPITALS MUST DISCLOSE 'PILL' TO RAPE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state appellate court has ruled that a "morning-after pill" constitutes 
"prevention" against pregnancy rather than an abortion, and that a hospital may 
be sued for damages if it fails to tell a rape victim about the pill's 
availability. 
</P>
<P>
A three-judge panel of the 2nd District Court of Appeal issued its finding in 
the case of Kathleen Brownfield, who was a 21-year-old Loyola Marymount 
University student in June, 1985, when she was raped and taken to Daniel 
Freeman Marina Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Represented by attorney Gloria Allred, Brownfield sued the Catholic hospital 
for allegedly refusing to give her or tell her about the estrogen prophylaxis 
pill Ovral. Only when it was too late, Brownfield complained, did she learn 
that such a pill must be taken within 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
No allegation was made that Brownfield, a Catholic, became pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Allred contended that many Catholic hospitals refuse to prescribe the pill 
because they believe it "violates Catholic beliefs against abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Brownfield did not sue for monetary damages, but for an injunction ordering the 
hospital to provide any rape victim with information and access to the pill -- 
or to transfer such patients to a nearby hospital providing "full emergency 
treatment." 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court, however, declined to grant her the right to sue for an 
injunction, concluding that Brownfield or any other rape victim could sue for 
damages for whatever injuries she might suffer. 
</P>
<P>
Allred said the decision permitting a rape victim to sue for damages 
accomplished the same result as though the court had given Brownfield the right 
to sue for an injunction because hospitals and doctors in California "are on 
notice . . . that if they do not provide access to the pill or information 
about it, they can now . . . be sued for significant amounts of money by rape 
victims." 
</P>
<P>
Brownfield, now 25, said she felt "very good" about the decision because "rape 
victims need to be made aware of this treatment option. . . . "

ARRESTS SMASH 'FOLLOW-HOME' ROBBERY RING, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With searches and arrests Friday in Woodland Hills and Central Los Angeles, 
police announced that they had smashed a ring of bandits believed responsible 
for as many as 50 "follow-home" robberies that have plagued the the Los Angeles 
area in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
The group of as many as 15 young men suspected in the case are all from 
neighborhoods near Exposition Park, but several of them have attended Pierce 
College in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the men, usually working in pairs, cruised in stolen cars 
through affluent neighborhoods of the San Fernando Valley, West Los Angeles and 
Glendale, then followed expensive cars home and robbed their occupants at 
gunpoint. Although the investigation is continuing, police said, the group is 
believed responsible for 45 to 50 robberies in which an estimated $300,000 in 
cash, jewelry, Rolex watches and furs were taken. 
</P>
<P>
"They called it 'going out on a mission,' " Cmdr. Frank Piersol said of the 
suspects' searches for victims, who were usually chosen because they were 
driving new Mercedes-Benzes. 
</P>
<P>
After the robberies, the participants would often take photographs of 
themselves holding the jewelry and cash they had stolen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a whole bunch of photographs of different people displaying different 
items" believed stolen in the robberies, Piersol said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said 11 men are in custody and four others are being sought. Five were 
arrested on suspicion of robbery in the raids Friday, including one man 
arrested while in class at Pierce College. They were being held at the Van Nuys 
jail in lieu of $250,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
Six others were already in custody and have been charged with robbery, Piersol 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During Friday's raids, officers confiscated three handguns and a rifle believed 
used during the robberies, an undisclosed amount of jewelry and several 
photographs of the suspects with watches, jewelry and cash fanned like playing 
cards in their hands, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Though a few of the suspects may have been affiliated with street gangs during 
their early teens, police said the crimes are not gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that it was a lot of people working loosely in a group," Piersol 
said. "Most seemed to know each other, and they came from the same area. . . . 
There was no one person that was a leader." 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested Friday were identified as Carlos Anthony Johnson, 19, and four 
18-year-olds, Michael Blackwell, Aaron Jackson, Saadite Green and Donald 
Tillman. 
</P>
<P>
Already in custody at County Jail, police said, are David Wilson, 22; Bryant 
Patton, 19, and Keith Franklin, Tousaint Thomas and Glen Polk, all 18. The 
dates of their arrests were not available. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old member of the group is in custody in Tucson, where he was 
arrested on suspicion of robbery, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrest warrants have been issued for Byron Davis, 22; Jimmy Grant, 21; Alton 
Pierce, 26, and Richard Oliver, 23, whose whereabouts are not known, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Piersol said the robberies began in late 1987 or early 1988 but were so 
sporadic and widespread that police did not notice a pattern. In October, 1988, 
after a rash of robberies in the west San Fernando Valley in which the victims 
were robbed of expensive Rolex watches, police arrested Polk, Piersol said. He 
was charged with robbery and released on bail. 
</P>
<P>
The following month, other members of the ring began following expensive cars 
home and robbing their occupants, usually after they had pulled their cars into 
garages, he said. Twice victims were shot during the robberies, which began 
occurring as often as three times a week, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the robberies took place in hillside neighborhoods from Sherman Oaks to 
Woodland Hills, causing a high degree of anxiety among residents. 
</P>
<P>
Police created a task force to investigate the "follow-home" robberies early 
this year and detectives focused the investigation on Polk because the Rolex 
robberies were carried out in a similar manner, Piersol said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation of Polk led to the other suspects, who were also identified 
by victims, witnesses and through other evidence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I truly believe we have identified most of the main players and most are in 
custody," Piersol said. 
</P>
<P>
But the task force assigned to the robberies will not yet be disbanded, he 
said, noting that detectives are still sorting out the robberies and 
determining which suspects may have committed them.

RETARDED GIRL AWARDED $14 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A mentally retarded 11-year-old girl won a $14-million medical malpractice suit 
against a Downey pediatrician Friday when a Norwalk Superior Court jury 
determined that the doctor failed to diagnose a hypothyroid condition at birth 
that could have been treated. 
</P>
<P>
James and Vicki Liston of Incline Village in the Lake Tahoe area, formerly of 
Lynwood, filed suit five years ago against the physician and St. Francis 
Hospital of Lynwood and its laboratory on behalf of their daughter, Jamie. 
</P>
<P>
The child, who has an IQ of only 69, will require lifelong supervision, 
probably in a sheltered setting. She now lives at home with her family -- 
including a normal twin brother -- and attends special education classes. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie's condition was not diagnosed until she was about 4 years old and 
noticeably slow in development, too late to be reversed with medication. 
</P>
<P>
The girl did not testify but was introduced to the jury once during the 
two-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
The Listons' attorney, Tom Girardi, said the amount sought by the family was 
the projected cost of lifetime care for Jamie. 
</P>
<P>
Before the jury reached its decision, the hospital had settled out of court 
with the Listons for $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
The pediatrician, Dr. Hamilton Sah of Downey, fought the suit. Reached at his 
office late Friday, Sah said he will appeal the verdict as "unjustified" and 
said he still believes that "I did the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
He said it is standard practice for the hospital laboratory to inform the 
attending pediatrician of any abnormal results of tests routinely run on 
newborns, and that he never received such a report on the test, known as a T-4. 
</P>
<P>
"It was their duty to inform me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sah's attorney, Dennis Keenan, could not be reached for comment.

CENSURED PRIEST 'SADDENED' BY COURT RULE; 
</P>
<P>
CURRAN WON'T APPEAL DECISION UPHOLDING SUSPENSION FROM TEACHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL CHANDLER, Times Religion Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Father Charles E. Curran, barred from teaching theology at the Catholic 
University of America in Washington, said he was "disappointed" and "saddened" 
by a court decision that upholds the school's ties to the Vatican over academic 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Frederick Weisberg ruled this week 
that Catholic University did not violate any tenure contracts when it obeyed a 
Vatican directive to suspend Curran from teaching at the papally chartered 
school -- the only university in the United States with such ties. Curran said 
he will not appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I have lost, but the university, its faculty and students may have lost more 
than I," Curran said in a statement after the ruling. "The court's opinion 
confirms what the university itself has asserted in this case: Full academic 
freedom, as understood in American higher education, does not now exist at 
Catholic University. That conclusion strikes at the heart of the university's 
character as an American university." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Differed With Teachings 
</P>
<P>
Curran, 54, a visiting professor of religion at USC this academic year, has 
long differed with official Roman Catholic teaching on some matters of sexual 
ethics regarding birth control, abortion, homosexuality, divorce and 
masturbation. After seven years of exchanges with the Vatican Congregation for 
the Doctrine of the Faith, Curran was notified in September, 1986, that he was 
under Vatican censure for his views. 
</P>
<P>
The case was closely watched by Catholic theologians and university officials 
throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Monika K. Hellwig, a theology professor at Georgetown University and a past 
president of the Catholic Theological Society of America, said of the court 
decision: "I think it spells the end of academic respectability for Catholic 
University. . . . I simply hope it doesn't affect other (Catholic) universities 
not chartered by the Holy See." 
</P>
<P>
But William May, a theology professor at Catholic University, agreed with 
Weisberg: "I think it's simply a recognition that teachers of Catholic theology 
have a responsibility to present it properly." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning his teaching role at Catholic University in 1965, Curran quickly 
became the focus of controversy with his outspoken dissent from Pope Paul VI's 
1968 encyclical reaffirming the church's ban on artificial birth control. 
University officials twice tried to remove the popular priest from his teaching 
post, but he was granted tenure in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
The court decision, released Tuesday after a trial held in December, climaxes 
the lengthy dispute. In his suit against the university, Curran claimed that 
the school had breached his contract and that he could rightfully be removed 
only if he were judged incompetent by a panel of academic peers. 
</P>
<P>
In the decision, Weisberg emphasized that Catholic University has a "unique 
relationship to the Holy See" as a pontifical university chartered by Pope Leo 
XIII in 1889. 
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, Prof. Curran testified that in fact he did understand at all relevant 
times that this special relationship existed. As much as he may have wished it 
otherwise, he could not reasonably have expected that the university would defy 
a definitive judgment of the Holy See that he was 'unsuitable' and 'ineligible' 
to teach Catholic theology," Weisberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Catholic University also has referred to itself as a fully modern 
American university, the judge continued: "Perhaps it can fairly be said that 
the university wanted it both ways; but on most issues it can also be said that 
the university could have it both ways. 
</P>
<P>
"On some issues -- and this case certainly presents one of them -- the conflict 
between the university's commitment to academic freedom and its unwavering 
fealty to the Holy See is direct and unavoidable. On such issues, the 
university may choose for itself on which side of that conflict it wants to 
come down, and nothing in its contract with Prof. Curran or any other faculty 
member promises that it will always come down on the side of academic freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers who are experts in church-state relations said the case -- in which 
attorneys argued over church law in a civil court -- constitutes a landmark in 
church-state law. During the nine-day trial, Cardinal James A. Hickey of 
Washington, who as chancellor of the university initiated the proceedings to 
remove Curran from his post, and Cardinal Joseph L. Bernardin of Chicago, 
chairman of the university's Board of Trustees, both testified that the school 
acted in accordance with canon, or church, law and upon its religious 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, a principal question of debate was whether the university, simultaneously 
an autonomous American institution and a Catholic institution with special 
legal ties to Rome, is governed basically by canon law or civil law at the 
critical junction of academic freedom and church doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called for Dismissal 
</P>
<P>
When the trial opened, the uni-versity's lawyers called for dismissal on 
grounds that the court lacked jurisdiction because the university acted on the 
basis of canon law when it suspended Curran from teaching. 
</P>
<P>
But Weisberg denied the motion, saying there was a civil contract at issue, and 
that the court could act as a fact-finder in determining where canon law ended 
and civil law began in the case. 
</P>
<P>
In his final ruling, the judge declared that the issue was whether Curran's 
contract gave him the right to teach Catholic theology at Catholic University 
"in the face of a definitive judgment by the Holy See that he is ineligible to 
do so. The court holds today that it does not. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether that is ultimately good for the university or for the church is 
something they have a right to decide for themselves," the judge concluded.

<P>
Jim Abbott got his sense of Yuma Friday morning, along with a sense of 
everything else that awaits him during his spring tour of cactus, cameras, 
curiosity and can-he-do-it? 
</P>
<P>
This was Abbott's professional debut, pitching for the Angels against the San 
Diego Padres in a B exhibition game, spring training's equivalent to the junior 
varsity. Normally, this is scrub land, of interest only to coaches and close 
personal friends, but Abbott's presence elevated it to headline status. 
</P>
<P>
First, they moved the game from the hinterlands of some side practice field to 
the main stadium, to accommodate all those eager for a glimpse of the Angels' 
one-handed, Olympic gold medal-winning, Sullivan Award-winning No. 1 draft 
choice from the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Then, they scheduled a mid-game press conference, to be held 45 minutes after 
Abbott's final pitch, to accommodate the 20 or so reporters present to 
chronicle the event. 
</P>
<P>
Then, they let Abbott pitch. 
</P>
<P>
And, on a windy day that sent sand and dust sweeping across the pitcher's mound 
and home plate, Abbott blew them away. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the first nine pitches he threw were strikes. Thomas Howard, the first 
Padre to step in against Abbott, was caught looking, taking an inside fastball 
for Strike 3. Gary Green, the next hitter, also struck out -- on three pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott was one pitch away from striking out the side when Joey Cora, on an 
0-and-2 count, bounced a grounder to Angel shortstop Kent Anderson, reaching 
base when Anderson bobbled the ball for an error. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott came back to retire the next four Padres he faced, including a strikeout 
of Carmelo Martinez, and didn't allow a hit until his third and final inning of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
His pitching line for the day: three innings, two hits, four strikeouts, no 
runs, no walks. 
</P>
<P>
Handicap? What handicap? 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great competitor, just to get here," said Padre infielder Tim Flannery. 
"But after three pitches, you forget all about that. 
</P>
<P>
"You're just looking for the ball -- and on that, he doesn't do anything 
different than anybody else. . . . He's got a fastball that just takes off. One 
just sailed and even the catcher couldn't catch it." 
</P>
<P>
Added Martinez: 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in the dugout's going, 'Yeah, check this guy out' and for my first 
at-bat, it was hard to concentrate. But then you realize that the ball comes 
from the same place and goes to the same place. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're looking just at his arm, he's got you." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres were guilty of that, at least once, when Martinez attempted to bunt. 
Because of Abbott's unique delivery -- he rests his glove on his right arm, 
throws left-handed and then flips the glove onto his left hand -- he is 
perceived as a vulnerable fielder. All his life, the scouting report on Abbott 
has been: Bunt away. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez tried. He fouled off the attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, he became Abbott's third strikeout victim. 
</P>
<P>
"That could turn out to be a plus for me," Abbott said afterward. "I think 
(Martinez) was the No. 3 hitter in their lineup. If it's a windy day and he 
wants to try and bunt . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, I'm efficient enough to make the play. If they're thinking that 
much about my weakness, that can only help me." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott spoke while seated at a picnic table behind the Padres' dressing room, 
surrounded by microphones, tape recorders, television cameras and autograph 
seekers. Simply standard procedure for your basic rookie pitcher, working 
middle relief in your basic B game. 
</P>
<P>
Is all the attention starting to overwhelm? Abbott was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't been this bad," he replied with a laugh. "I try to handle it the 
best I can. It's a lot of attention, but as long as it doesn't interfere with 
my pitching, it doesn't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
It comes with Abbott's own unique parcel of territory, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of it's nice," he said. "I think it's an acknowledgement that there is 
some talent there. If I wasn't doing well and if I wasn't at this level, then 
me being born with one hand wouldn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
"But at the same time, if I had two hands, there wouldn't be all this 
attention. I'd just be another left-handed pitcher. So, it's a double-edged 
sword." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott then proceeded to field the usual brand of Jim Abbott questions. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Was Pete Gray, the one-armed outfielder for the old St. Louis Browns, 
a boyhood idol? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: "Pete Gray did what Pete Gray did. He's not my hero. But, I respect 
what he did. If we could changes places, I don't think Pete Gray would 
necessarily be a fan of mine. It's just something you have to deal with on your 
own." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does Abbott consider himself an inspiration to handicapped youngsters? 
</P>
<P>
A: "If someone gets a message from what I do, fine. I'm not out there to carry 
a message or trumpet myself. I was born without a right hand, but I was also 
born with a strong left arm that's enabled me to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"If it helps someone out, that goes beyond the three innings I pitch and 
whatever strikes and balls I throw. Maybe it might help somebody play 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is fielding a problem? 
</P>
<P>
A: "I don't really work at switching the glove anymore. I've been doing this 
since I was 5 years old. Now, it's just as natural as tying my shoes." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Abbott has begun to consider another topic: His chances of pitching 
in the big leagues in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott is signed to a double-A contract and has yet to pitch one regular-season 
inning as a professional. He still needs to develop a more consistent curveball 
to go with his explosive fastball and the Angels' rotation, barring injury, is 
already set. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old's presence in the club's major league camp this spring has 
almost as much to do with public-relations value as potential. 
</P>
<P>
He's a good story now, but probably doesn't project as a contender for an Angel 
roster spot until later. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Abbott said. "I've never played professional baseball before. I 
don't know what it takes. 
</P>
<P>
"All I'm trying to do is put it in a place where somebody else has to make the 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader will have some say in that decision. It's a long way 
from Yuma to Anaheim, but for openers, color Rader impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"How about that first batter?" Rader said. "Wham, wham, see you later. 
</P>
<P>
"The level of his maturity and his composure and his stability, I can't tell 
you how wonderful it is. All the accolades he's received are richly deserved." 
</P>
<P>
Rader also pointed to the windy conditions, which made pitching an iffy 
proposition at best. Mike Fetters preceded Abbott to the mound for the Angels 
and did a good deal of struggling, allowing four hits and three walks in three 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike was a little out of whack," Rader noted. "But it looked like the wind 
completely unfazed Abby. They were difficult conditions -- and he still did a 
pretty good job." 
</P>
<P>
For that job, Rader said, Abbott was given "a hell of a bonus." 
</P>
<P>
Such as? 
</P>
<P>
"I gave him a lemon drop," Rader said with a grin. "It'll be a tad more 
expensive for Mike (Port) down the line." 
</P>
<P>
For Abbott, Friday was the start of the line. Next stop: Phoenix on Tuesday for 
his first appearance in an A game. After that, upward and onward into the 
Arizona desert. 
</P>
<P>
The adventure is under way. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
And then they played the A game. Upstaged by Abbott and Co. in the morning, the 
Angels were also upstaged by the Padres in the afternoon, losing their 
exhibition opener, 10-6. Mike Witt and Jack Lazorko combined to pitch six 
ragged innings, Witt allowing three runs on five hits in three innings, Lazorko 
yielding five runs on seven hits and three walks. San Diego starter Bruce 
Hurst, the free-agent pitcher who got away from Boston last winter, worked 
three innings and limited the Angels to a run on three hits. Dave Leiper, who 
pitched the middle three innings for San Diego was the winning pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Dante (Beef) Bichette, the brawny rookie outfielder who welcomed Bert Blyleven 
to camp with a mammoth home run in Wednesday's intra-squad game, added two 
doubles in two at-bats against Padre pitching. Initially targeted for triple-A 
Edmonton for one more year of seasoning, Bichette, 25, could push his way into 
contention for a reserve outfield spot with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"It's whatever's in his best interests," Manager Doug Rader said. "A lot 
depends on the health of Brian (Downing). If Brian's not OK, we'll have to give 
some consideration to using him here. (But) you hate to really draw too great a 
conclusion from a game and a half. Feel grateful that he had a good ballgame, 
but take it as that, for right now." . . . Claudell Washington also had two 
hits, a home run and a double. Dick Schofield added another home run, with 
Devon White, Jeff Manto and Jim McCollom each contributing a double. 
</P>
<P>
As he did last spring, Angel Vice President Mike Port has bent his March 4 
cut-off for negotiating contracts and will continue talking with the agents of 
Chuck Finley, Urbano Lugo and White, the three remaining unsigned Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Last year at about this time White avoided automatic contract renewal by 
reaching an agreement, but he now says: "I don't know if it's going to be like 
that this year. I don't think my contract is being handled in good faith. It's 
been three weeks now and there have been no real negotiations. It's not really 
the money anymore -- we're not that far apart. But this could've been handled 
three weeks ago. We could've had a happy Mike Port and a happy Devon White." 
</P>
<P>
Finley will start today's Yuma rematch for the Angels, followed by Greg Minton, 
Bob McClure and Bryan Harvey.

<P>
THE HARD LIFE AND TIMES OF BOB PROBERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Probert's arrest Thursday for allegedly smuggling cocaine into the United 
States was another wretched episode in the life of a man seemingly bent on 
self-destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors that his problems went beyond alcohol abuse had long been circulating 
around the National Hockey League and scared off several teams that were 
interested in acquiring him from the Detroit Red Wings for his size and brute 
strength; it's unlikely he will play in the NHL again. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings' tolerance of his outrageous disregard for curfews and 
regulations created a huge rift because it established one set of rules for 
Probert and another for everyone else. And the distraction of wondering whether 
he would show -- and what shape he'd be in if he did -- dragged the Wings down 
all season. They should be better than their record, barely above .500, shows. 
Look for them to take off now that they don't have to worry about him and his 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings' organization helped Probert immensely by sending him through 
various alcohol rehabilitation programs during the last two years and keeping 
him on the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
They may have done too much. Probert ultimately has to be responsible for 
himself, and he is either incapable or unwilling to accept that. It's sad to 
see anyone apparently tumble into the trap of drug abuse, but Probert walked in 
with his eyes open and after being given more chances of rescue than most 
people. 
</P>
<P>
There should be a flurry of activity up until Tuesday's trading deadline. But 
don't believe the Denis Savard trade rumors. He's going to stay in Chicago 
because he's simply too valuable an offensive weapon and because if he gets 
hot, he might lead the Blackhawks through two Norris playoff rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some people who might have new addresses: 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg center Dale Hawerchuk is being ardently sought by several teams. The 
most persistent rumor has the Philadelphia Flyers landing him in exchange for 
left winger Brian Propp, center Dave Poulin and a draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
Hawerchuk would be a tremendous addition to a corps that includes Ron Sutter 
and Keith Acton. But Philadelphia can't afford to trade away wingers, so Propp, 
who is playing well, may not be dealt. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers and Buffalo Sabres are looking for goaltenders. Quebec's Mario 
Gosselin might fit the bill in Philadelphia, and Buffalo may get Toronto's Ken 
Wregget. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Louis Blues and Jets discussed a deal that would send defenseman Brian 
Benning and center Tony Hrkac to Winnipeg for veteran defenseman Randy Carlyle 
and winger Andrew McBain. Bad deal for St. Louis. General Manager Ron Caron, 
who seems to make 90% of his trades with Montreal and 9% with Calgary, can do 
better if he needs help on defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Kings would like a defensive-oriented defenseman and have asked 
the Toronto Maple Leafs about Borje Salming. They have few draft picks left to 
give, though, and to give up another young player would be most foolish. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton General Manager Glen Sather reportedly wants Walt Poddubny (whom he 
had briefly), Michel Goulet or Peter Stastny from Quebec. His best shot is 
Poddubny, who wouldn't mind leaving the French-speaking city and could help the 
Oilers' power play. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto is willing to move Tom Fergus and Ed Olczyk, and the New York Rangers 
might make a pitch for Olczyk, a strong forward who plays center or wing. What 
do the Leafs need? Everything. 
</P>
<P>
Former Sabres star Gilbert Perreault, coach of Victoriaville in the Quebec 
Major Junior Hockey League, on his job: "Anybody can coach. It all depends on 
how the players understand you and how much respect you get from them. Respect 
is what separates winning coaches from ones who don't win."

NOLAN RYAN JUST ZIPS ALONG ON NEW TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD JUSTICE, Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Press him on it, get him past the Live at Five standups and the quick 
handshakes, and Nolan Ryan will admit, yes, there is some pain in this first 
day as a Texas Ranger. 
</P>
<P>
There's pain in knowing that his job is no longer 45 minutes from his ranch, 
and that a large chunk of his summer will be spent away from his two teen-age 
sons, 12-year-old daughter and wife of 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
Press him, and he'll admit, yes, he's sorry it had to come to this. True, he 
had spent his first 12 big-league seasons with the New York Mets and California 
Angels, but if anyone was ever born to play for the Houston Astros it's this 
proud son of Alvin, Texas. (Pop. 16,515). 
</P>
<P>
"At this time of year, the realization hits you more," he said. "It's tough to 
read stories about the Astros and know it no longer affects me. They had been a 
large part of my life for nine years. It can be depressing." 
</P>
<P>
After nine seasons in Houston, where his 82-acre ranch was an easy drive from 
the player's entrance of the Astrodome, he slipped into another new uniform for 
the first time this week. 
</P>
<P>
He had permission to arrive late to wrap up loose ends with his cattle business 
and came armed with an easy Texas twang, a handshake for his new teammates and 
a tape of the six-hour mini-series "Lonesome Dove," his way of licking the 
doldrums of a 25th spring training. 
</P>
<P>
At an afternoon press conference, he said all the right things. Yes, he is sad 
to leave Houston, but, no, he won't look back. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be an adjustment," he said. "I won't be as accessible to a lot 
of things as when I was with Houston. It's different, but it's interesting. 
There's always anticipation, and I'm looking forward to getting started." 
</P>
<P>
If it was a bittersweet day for him, it was a joyous one for the Rangers, 
who've already circled the date of his signing (Dec. 7, 1988) as one of their 
most important ever. 
</P>
<P>
When his one-year, $2-million contract was announced, phone calls to their 
ticket office jumped from 25 to 150 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"Nolan brings something special," General Manager Tom Grieve said. 
</P>
<P>
At 42, Ryan brings a 95 mph fastball and a crackling curveball. Each time he 
walks to the mound, there's the anticipation that something magical will 
happen, that fans will see something they may never see again. 
</P>
<P>
He has thrown a record five no-hitters and missed a sixth when Mike Schmidt 
homered after 8 1-3 innings last April 27. He has nine one-hitters and 19 
two-hitters. His 4,775 strikeouts are unrivaled. He's 27 victories shy of 300. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just his accomplishments, but that at 42 he appears to have lost 
almost nothing. National League hitters say the scuffball he added in 1986 has 
made him more unhittable some days. 
</P>
<P>
He refused to be cornered into numerical goals, saying only that if he were 
healthy for 35 starts and 225 innings "everything else will be all right." 
</P>
<P>
His Houston career ended badly and with some bitterness. He earned $1.3 million 
last season, and the Astros offered a cut in base pay from $1 million to about 
$900,000. 
</P>
<P>
That angered Ryan, who'd seen what the bidding for free agents Mike Moore and 
Bruce Hurst was. Still, the Astros figured to have him back, apparently because 
they didn't believe there was another team interested. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when California Angels owner Gene Autry got involved, the bidding got 
crazy, and the Rangers, desperate for both a drawing card and a pitcher, hung 
on. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan walked away with a base salary of $1.6 million and a $200,000 signing 
bonus for 1989. The Rangers have a $1.4 million option for 1990, but can buy 
out of that year for $200,000. So while the total guaranteed money is $2 
million, the odds are that he will earn the full $3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers gave him a locker next to Bobby Witt, who at 24 has been compared 
to Ryan at a similar age. Like Ryan, Witt has a blazing fastball, and like Ryan 
he has spent his first three seasons trying to control it (Ryan is baseball's 
all-time leader in both walks and strikeouts, and Witt has averaged 9.1 
strikeouts and 7.3 walkouts per nine ninnings in his first three seasons). 
</P>
<P>
"It's a thrill just to meet him," Witt said. "I've watched him for as long as 
I've been playing. I'd try to think along with him. I'd try to see why he was 
doing what he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
Rangers pitching coach Tom House called Ryan "a role model. They'll watch the 
way he walks, the way he talks, the way he stands on the mound, how he gets 
hitters out." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan emphasized he "would not come in as a pitching coach. I don't think that 
would be right. But as our friendships develop, it could lead to discussions 
and me having something to offer." 
</P>
<P>
He has never been much of a coach, unofficial or otherwise. Instead, what the 
Rangers hope is that their kids -- such as Witt -- will watch what he throws 
and how he prepares. Ryan's three-hour weight, stretching and running exercises 
are almost as legendary as his fastball. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, while there may be some Houston left in his heart, there will be 
none in his effort. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to take the attitude that you look at the challenge ahead and don't look 
back," he said. "I won't reflect on the past now. I'm here because I still like 
the competition. I enjoy working out and being in shape and I like the 
one-on-one competition with the hitter. At this point, I enjoy it more than 
ever because I don't have that much longer to go. . . . I can't think of any 
better place to finish up." 
</P>
<P>
When he signed a three-year contract with the Astros in 1979, he called it "my 
last contract." 
</P>
<P>
"When I broke in, power pitchers were gone by their mid- or early-30s," he 
said. "I didn't see any reason I'd be different. But I'm still here, and I 
won't make any more predictions."

DEFLECTED PASS BEATS SOCKERS IN OVERTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

KANSAS CITY, Mo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Ion wasn't shooting, he was passing. But Ion's pass deflected off the foot 
of Socker defender George Fernandez and into the goal with 2 minutes 26 seconds 
left in overtime Friday night, giving the Kansas City Comets a 3-2 victory at 
Kemper Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The loss ended the Sockers' two-game winning streak and dropped them to 18-15, 
four games behind the league-leading Baltimore Blast, whom they will play 
tonight. The Comets (14-18) won their third in a row and moved into a tie for 
fifth place with Tacoma in the Major Indoor Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the Sockers' losses this year have been in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The Comets had lost three consecutive overtime games, but that streak ended 
largely because of Ion's end-to-end rush with the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a pass for (Dale) Mitchell," Ion said of his 18th goal of the season 
and second overtime game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the ball from David (Brcic), pushed it past (Waad) Hirmez and I was 
surprised to see I was at the end of (the play). I cut the ball behind a 
defender, trying to get it back in the middle for Dale. It hit Fernandez and 
went in the net." 
</P>
<P>
As the ball rested behind San Diego's Victor Nogueria, the MISL's leading 
goalkeeper, Fernandez stood in the goal mouth, hands on his knees, staring at 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"It went off my toe . . . just hard luck," Fernandez said. "They worked harder. 
. . . I beat the No. 1 goalkeeper. Not too many people can do that." 
</P>
<P>
The Comets outshot the Sockers, 10-2, in the overtime and only Nogueria's 
goalkeeping kept San Diego in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"From the halfway point on, we dominated and took control," said Comets Coach 
Dave Clements, whose team has beaten San Diego two games in a row. "They had 
some chances but we had many more. Nogueria (25 saves) made some fantastic 
saves, and I was frightened that we had so much pressure that they would 
counter with a breakaway-type goal." 
</P>
<P>
Not the way the Sockers have played in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"Ion must be fitter than our lads," Sockers Coach Ron Newman said. "He ran by 
every one of our guys. 
</P>
<P>
"They seemed to have more stamina than we did. In overtime, we can't drive 
ourselves when the going gets tough. In the overtime, we didn't have a chance 
of winning the game. There's not doubt Kansas City deserved it in the 
(overtime), but it was a fluke goal." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez attributed the Sockers' 2-8 overtime record to "lack of drive . . . 
no commitment. It's like we're happy to make it into the overtime and after 
that, it's downhill." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Boncek appeared to have given the Comets the victory with 1:32 left in 
regulation when he scored off a pass from Iain Fraser. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the Sockers lifted Nogueria in favor of a sixth attacker -- 
Kevin Crow -- and just 38 seconds later, Hirmez, on a pass from Crow, tied it. 
It was Hirmez's seventh goal in four games since he rejoined the Sockers in a 
trade with Los Angeles at the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied, 1-1, after three quarters as each team scored an unassisted 
goal. San Diego's Alan Willey scored 2:34 into the first quarter, and David 
Doyle scored 7:07 into the third quarter for Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers missed an opportunity to take the lead late in the third quarter 
when they were awarded a penalty kick because the Comets' Gino Schiraldi was 
called for tripping Willey in the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
But Brcic stopped Branko Segota's penalty kick with a kick save, and Kansas 
City killed the 2-minute penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers claimed Brcic was in violation of moving before the shot. 
</P>
<P>
"David was miles off the goal line," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
Aware that only 13 of 39 penalty kicks have been successful since the MISL 
moved the penalty spot from 24 to 34 feet this season, Newman said, "Either we 
make it right . . . these are the rules. There's never a save in these. He 
should have had it over again." 
</P>
<P>
Segota, now one of four in penalty kicks this season, said, "The guy was out 
there a yard before I even took the shot."

LAZERS PLAY DALLAS TODAY AT FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lazers, losers of two straight, will play host to the Dallas Sidekicks 
today at 1:30 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
It has been nearly a week since the Lazers (16-17) last played a Major Indoor 
Soccer League game, losing to the San Diego Sockers, 8-1, in falling six games 
behind the first-place Baltimore Blast. 
</P>
<P>
The Lazers haven't fared too well against Dallas, either. The Sidekicks 
(16-16), a half-game ahead of the Lazers, have won four of five meetings this 
season.

LOUISVILLE PICKS BAD TIME TO FALTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robyn Norwood 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The team of the 1980s is running out of time, and now its coach says it already 
is too late. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville started the decade with a national championship in 1980, and won 
another in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals came within a day of taking over the No. 1 spot in the polls this 
season, but a loss to Ohio State Jan. 29 spoiled their chance. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, almost nothing has gone right -- including, most memorably, the 
goaltending call in Pauley Pavilion. Starting with the loss to Ohio State, 
Louisville has lost six of 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Coach Denny Crum went on record with what surely is one of the 
earliest concession speeches in basketball history. 
</P>
<P>
"The way this team has been playing, its chances are slim to none," Crum told 
the Louisville Courier-Journal. "This team isn't good enough. They had a chance 
to be, but they haven't made progress because they haven't paid the price and 
played with intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"They wasted three weeks and six or eight games of an opportunity to get 
better, and now there isn't enough time to overcome what they've missed. In my 
opinion, this team has very little chance, if any, to be a competitor at year's 
end. They don't work hard enough. They can beat some of those (National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament) teams, but they can't win it. They have 
no shot." 
</P>
<P>
Crum, who had threatened to make lineup changes last week, made some for the 
Cardinals' game against Cincinnati Wednesday, pulling Keith Williams and Tony 
Kimbro out of the starting five. Different players, same result: Louisville 
lost, 77-71. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Crum was kinder to his players than he had been earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel bad for my kids," he said. "They wanted to win so badly. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the pressure has just gotten to them and they haven't been able to 
play up to their ability. We've tried just about everything. I've been doing 
this 29 years, and I've never had a team in this frame of mind this late in the 
year. I don't know what to do for them. . . . I wish I knew a simple little 
magic answer." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals' troubles started that day against Ohio State, when Pervis 
Ellison -- the outstanding player of the '86 title team as a freshman -- 
injured his knee. Ohio State went on to win. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville won its next two games, against Virginia Tech and Memphis State, 
without him. Ellison returned, but next came a three-point loss to Florida 
State. After a victory over Cincinnati, the Cardinals lost the game to UCLA on 
the questionable goaltending call against Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after a victory over Florida State, came a loss to Memphis State. Then a 
victory over Southern Mississippi. Then a loss to South Carolina. Then the loss 
to Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville, which opened the season 0-2 but then won its next 14 straight, is a 
19-8 team with one regular-season game left -- against Notre Dame today. 
</P>
<P>
Add team of the '80s: If Crum is right, and the Cardinals have no shot at the 
championship, the only team with a chance to win three titles in this decade is 
third-ranked Indiana, which won in 1981 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
For perspective on how long it has been since Louisville won the 1980 
championship with Darrell Griffith with a victory over UCLA, consider this: 
Tony Branch, a reserve on that team, is a first-year head coach at Lamar, in 
Beaumont, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
More ancient history: If Arizona beats UCLA today and stays at the top of the 
polls, it will be the first time since 1975 that a Pacific 10 team has been No. 
1 in the final poll. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, of course, was the last Pac-10 team to manage that. 
</P>
<P>
Play on: The routine in the proliferating cases in which college athletes are 
arrested or charged with crimes has been to suspend the player, pending the 
outcome of the investigation or trial. 
</P>
<P>
By so doing, a school avoids the appearance of condoning the action, yet at the 
same time allows that the athlete may be innocent. 
</P>
<P>
But at Texas San Antonio, where reserve Keith Horne recently was arrested for 
allegedly attempting to strangle a woman in a restroom on a team trip to 
DeLand, Fla., the player has not been suspended. Horne, a reserve, is still 
with the team. 
</P>
<P>
Add Texas San Antonio: The Roadrunners' coach, Ken Burmeister, is one of three 
candidates being interviewed for the Cal State Fullerton coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
Burmeister, a former assistant to Lute Olson at Arizona and Iowa, took 
Texas-San Antonio to the NCAA tournament in only his second season as coach 
last year. He interviewed for the Fullerton job last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA assistant Paul Landreaux interviewed last Monday, and acting coach John 
Sneed, the front-runner, is scheduled to interview Sunday, Monday or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Whither the WAC: Remember how impressed you were with the Western Athletic 
Conference last season? Recall how Fennis Dembo helped Wyoming to a 26-6 
record? How Brigham Young was undefeated after 17 games? 
</P>
<P>
Neither team is so impressive now. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointment met disappointment Thursday when BYU beat Wyoming, 71-67. That 
brought BYU's record to 14-13 and dropped Wyoming's to 13-16. 
</P>
<P>
Locker room guest of the season -- so far: After Duke had lost to Arizona at 
East Rutherford, N.J., Sunday, former President Richard M. Nixon stopped by to 
offer his sympathy, the Arizona Republic reported. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, of course, is a graduate of Duke's law school. 
</P>
<P>
Duke's Christian Laettner, who missed the first of a one-and-one with Duke 
trailing by two in the final seconds, reported that Nixon told the players he 
had made a few shots like that in his day -- and missed a few. 
</P>
<P>
The Duke players, Laettner said, "just chuckled." 
</P>
<P>
College Basketball Notes 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall needs one more victory to make it six straight seasons that the 
Pirates have improved on the previous year's victory total. They went 6-23 in 
1982-83, P.J. Carlesimo's first season as coach. The succeeding records: 9-19, 
10-18, 14-18, 15-14, 22-13 and this season's start of 22-5.

<P>
Mark Gubicza combined with three other pitchers on a four-hit shutout as the 
Kansas City Royals beat the Dodgers, 2-0, Friday in the exhibition opener for 
both teams. 
</P>
<P>
Gubicza, 20-8 last season, pitched three perfect innings, striking out three. 
He was followed by Jeff Montgomery, Jerry Don Gleaton and Steve Farr, with 
Gleaton getting the victory and Farr a save. Tim Crews, who pitched the eighth, 
was the loser. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie shortstop Jose Vizcaino's throwing error allowed Gary Thurman to reach 
first to lead off the eighth. Thurman took second on Jim Eisenreich's bunt 
single and scored when Vizcaino threw away Kevin Seitzer's grounder for an 
error. In all, Vizcaino made three errors. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Capra's sacrifice fly with the bases loaded scored Eisenreich. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger right-hander Tim Leary picked up where he left off in 1988 as he pitched 
three scoreless innings. He allowed one hit and two walks and struck out two. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Leary had his most productive season in the majors as he won 17 
games and finished among the National League leaders in earned-run average, 
complete games and shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt great today," Leary said. "I wanted to get in a good day's work and I 
felt like I did that. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time out, it wasn't bad." 
</P>

SATTERFIELD WAS A VICTIM OF CONGENITAL HEART DEFECT

<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Satterfield, a member of the Notre Dame national championship football team 
who collapsed and died suddenly at a nightclub in January, was a victim of a 
congenital heart defect, a medical examiner announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Satterfield, 22, a former Notre Dame High School standout from Encino, "died as 
a result of subtle congenital heart defects which were previously unknown and 
resulted in cardiac arrest followed by seizure activity," said a report from 
Dr. Fred M. Busse, the medical examiner of Berrien County, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The heart defect amounted to an "abnormality in the system which regulates the 
heartbeat," Busse said, quoting the opinion of Dr. S. Bharati, director of the 
Congenital Heart and Conduction System Center in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Satterfield died on the morning of Jan. 19 after he collapsed at a nightclub in 
Niles, Mich., a few miles north of South Bend. He had traveled with his 
teammates to Washington for a White House ceremony commemorating the team's 
national championship, and they had returned to South Bend the previous 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
Satterfield, an offensive and defensive back, went to the nightclub with two 
teammates, tailback Mark Green and defensive end Darrell Gordon. He danced 
several times and sat down to talk. Upon leaving, he stood up, suddenly put his 
arm out and collapsed, first to the table and then to the floor, and went into 
a seizure, Busse said. 
</P>
<P>
Life-support measures were not started for at least six minutes after emergency 
assistance was summoned, and two neuropathologists who also examined autopsy 
materials believe Satterfield was brain dead by that time, Busse said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Satterfield had been in excellent health," Busse said. "As a member of the 
Notre Dame football team, he was required to maintain a high level of physical 
condition. His medical history did not reveal any obvious cause for his sudden 
death."

SADDLEBACK, MILLIKAN MEET IN 5-AA TITLE GAME TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Ana Saddleback and Long Beach Millikan, two well-balanced teams that like 
to fast break, will meet tonight at 8:15 for the high school boys' Southern 
Section 5-AA Division basketball title as part of a five-game package at the 
Sports Arena. Saddleback is 27-1, Millikan 24-6. 
</P>
<P>
In the late morning-early afternoon session, Oxnard Santa Clara (22-3) plays 
Orange Lutheran (23-3) at 10:30 a.m. in the 2-A Division final; Whittier 
Christian (21-6) meets Banning (21-4) at 12:30 p.m. in the 2-AA championship 
game, and Mission Viejo Trabuco Hills (21-6) plays Corona del Mar (19-9) at 
2:30 p.m. in the 3-A final. 
</P>
<P>
In the evening session, Irvine (25-5) and Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley 
(23-4) play for the 5-A title at 6:30, before the Saddleback-Millikan game. 
</P>
<P>
Millikan is the third Moore League team that Saddleback will meet in the 
playoffs, having previously beaten league champion Lakewood, 65-61, and 
third-place finisher Long Beach Jordan, 81-59. Millikan also knocked off 
second-seeded Santa Monica St. Monica, 83-80, and third-seeded Loyola, 85-84, 
in getting to the final. 
</P>
<P>
Malru Dottin, a 6-foot-7 center averaging 16.8 points and 9.3 rebounds, leads 
Saddleback in both categories. Guards Terry Hilliard, averaging 14.6 points a 
game, and Jeep Jensen, averaging 13.5, are the offensive leaders for Millikan. 
</P>
<P>
Before meeting in the 5-A final, Irvine and Capistrano Valley played twice in 
the South Coast League, Capistrano Valley winning first at home, 57-56, and 
then at Irvine, 66-43. This will be Irvine Coach Steve Keith's third title game 
in nine years. He won titles with Glendale in 1981 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley's offense revolves around guards Scott McCorkle, who is 
averaging 25 points a game, and Chris Kostoff, who is averaging 21. Irvine is 
also led in scoring by a guard, Bryan Allred, who is averaging 16 points, but 
the play of the Molle brothers, 6-5 senior Raphael and 6-6 sophomore John, 
could be the deciding factor.

MISSION PREP 56-48 WINNER OF 1-A TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mission College Prep of San Luis Obispo (19-5) defeated Flintridge Prep, 56-48, 
Friday night at St. Francis High to win the 1-A title and advance to Division V 
of the Southern California Regional tournament next week. 
</P>
<P>
Don Burns led the way for the Tri-County League champions with 21 points and 
was aided by teammates Mike Grimes and Alex Sheffield, both with 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
David Swayne, with 13 points, and Shaun Kunisaki, with 10, were the top scorers 
for Flintridge Prep (15-11). 
</P>
<P>
Mission College Prep gained a seven-point advantage at the half, 30-23. 
</P>
<P>
Bel-Air Prep 64, Newport Christian 58 -- Ahmad Clayton, a 5-11 guard had a 
team-high 23 points as Bel-Air Prep opened a 14-point lead midway through the 
fourth quarter in the Small Schools championship at Pepperdine. John Bahnsen of 
Newport Christian (21-3), who had been averaging 31 points in the playoffs, was 
held to 8 points in the first half, but finished with 27. By winning, Bel-Air 
Prep (20-8) qualified for the Southern California Regional tournament in 
Division V. Newport Christian, with a record of 21-3, has an excellent chance 
of qualifying as an at-large team.

CITY GIRLS' CHAMPIONSHIP ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON DEFEATS CRENSHAW, 66-48 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After losing to Crenshaw twice in early-season play, Washington High School 
defeated its Southern League rival, 66-48, to win the City 4-A girls' 
basketball championship Friday at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, which trailed, 27-21, late in the second quarter, outscored 
Crenshaw, 12-2, to close out the half with a 33-29 lead. Leading Washington's 
rally was junior guard Detra Lockhart, who scored their last six points of the 
half and finished with 22. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Coach Phil Chase credits the his team's ability to shut down 
Crenshaw's senior guards, Allison Jackson and Claudia Jones, to a combined 17 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they got that early lead, they got overconfident," Chase said. "They 
thought it would be easy and when we rallied, they started taking bad shots." 
</P>
<P>
Washington (22-4) was also got 18 points from junior guard Remitha Houston, and 
11 from freshman center Charisse Sampson. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw finished the season 23-3. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall 56, Roosevelt 45 -- Trailing by 11 at halftime, the Roughriders scored 
the first six points of the fourth quarter to cut the Barristers' lead to 
40-35, but Marshall went on a 12-4 run to clinch its first City girls' 3-A 
Division title at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Junior forward Lisa Khuu led Marshall (18-2) with 17 points. Rena Winter and 
Tina Chimarios added 14 and 10 points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore guard Rosa Mendez scored a game-high 18 points to lead Roosevelt 
(14-4). No other Roosevelt player was in double figures, and Eastern League MVP 
Luscinda Silva was held to seven points.

American John Regis set a meet record of 20.54 in winning the 200 meters at the 
World Indoor Track and Field Championships Friday, but the happiest runner in 
the race was teammate Kevin Little, a junior at Drake University who got third 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Regis broke the meet record of 20.73, set by American Kirk Baptiste two years 
ago in the first world championships at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Robson da Silva finished second, but was disqualified for running out 
of his lane. That moved third-place finisher Ade Mafe of Britain to second and 
Little from fourth to third. 
</P>
<P>
So how did Little feel? "Surprised! That's the word," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Little, who never had run faster than 21.28 indoors, was timed in 21.22 in the 
first-round heats, 21.05 in the semifinals and 21.12 in the final. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Kingdom won the 60-meter hurdles in 7.43, breaking the meet record of 
7.46 set by Greg Foster in the semifinals at Indianapolis two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Colin Jackson was second in 7.45. Tonie Campbell, the winner last 
year, finished last in a six-man field. He is suffering from tendinitis. 
</P>
<P>
Nelli Cooman of the Netherlands, the world record-holder and five-time European 
champion in the women's 60-meter dash, won her second world indoor title, 
leading all the way and clocking a meet record of 7.05. Cooman's world record 
is 7.00. 
</P>
<P>
Gwen Torrence ran 7.07 to finish second and break her own American record. 
Alice Brown set an American record of 7.13 last Sunday, but Torrence broke that 
in the semifinals here with a 7.10. 
</P>
<P>
American sprinters Floyd Heard and Mark Witherspoon scratched from the men's 60 
meters, apparently at the suggestion of their coach, Joe Douglas of the Santa 
Monica Track Club. Douglas earlier kept many of his other athletes out of last 
weekend's U.S. championships.

CAROLCO MAKES OFFER TO BUY DE LAURENTIIS; 
</P>
<P>
SEVERAL EARLIER BIDDERS FOR AILING MOVIE COMPANY HAVE FADED AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Carolco Pictures Inc., best known as the producer of the "Rambo" films, on 
Friday said it has made an offer to acquire De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, 
a motion picture company that sought the protection of federal bankruptcy court 
last August. 
</P>
<P>
The terms of the bid weren't disclosed, but Carolco President and Chief 
Executive Peter M. Hoffman said the offer is "competitive" with the $22-million 
bid that had been anticipated from a rival, Cannon Group, until it abruptly 
withdrew from talks earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be premature to discuss any of the terms because there is no binding 
agreement," Hoffman said in a telephone interview. Nevertheless, he said the 
company is prepared to pay more than half of its bid in cash, in addition to 
securities in a new company formed to make the acquisition. Los Angeles-based 
Carolco said it expects the new company's shares to be traded on the American 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Carolco said "acceptance of the offer by DEG is 
expected." But neither DEG Chairman and Chief Executive Stephen R. Greenwald 
nor the company's outside financial adviser, Joel H. Reader of Oppenheimer 
&amp; Co., could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Since October, at least five potential buyers of DEG have been publicly 
identified, but each has faded away. Just last week, Ventura Entertainment 
Group withdrew its $22-million offer "for overall business considerations," 
said Ventura Chairman Harvey Bibicoff, with "no reflection on DEG." 
</P>
<P>
Cannon withdrew from the negotiations in a huff, according to two sources, 
apparently because it was not given an exclusive chance to formulate its bid. 
</P>
<P>
One member of DEG's unsecured creditors' committee noted that because the 
Beverly Hills company has sought the protection of bankruptcy court, the 
details of any bid will eventually become public and exposed to the possibility 
of a higher bid. The executive, who asked not to be identified, predicted that 
three or four months might elapse "before the final scenario is played out." 
</P>
<P>
Before filing for bankruptcy protection, DEG sold most of the foreign 
television, video and cable rights to its film library to Parafrance, a French 
concern, to pay off nearly $57 million in revolving bank loans. The company's 
remaining assets include a studio in North Carolina and certain film rights and 
accounts receivable.

GROUP LED BY JACOBS PROPOSES TO BUY SHAKLEE FOR $528 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group led by Minneapolis investor Irwin L. Jacobs announced Friday a 
long-anticipated proposal to buy Shaklee Corp., a marketer of foods, vitamins 
and personal care products, in a deal valuing the company at $528 million. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs has been steadily buying shares in San Francisco-based Shaklee, and his 
investment group already holds close to 15% of the company's 13.2 million 
outstanding shares. In response, Shaklee has taken steps to prevent a possible 
takeover attempt. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Shaklee sold a 78% stake in its profitable Japanese subsidiary to 
Tokyo's Yananouchi Pharmaceutical for $350 million. On Thursday, it declared a 
$20-a-share special dividend for stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
But Jacobs, whose tentative offer for Shaklee amounts to $40 a share, told the 
Dow Jones News Service on Friday that "we didn't think too much of the dividend 
and the market clearly didn't either. We think Shaklee Corp. is worth more than 
the value the market is putting on it." 
</P>
<P>
The buyout offer was revealed after the close of trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange on Friday. In composite trading, Shaklee closed at $34 a share, down 
50 cents. The stock rose $4 a share after Shaklee sold the stake in its 
Japanese unit, but the shares have not risen above $36.25 in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Colorful Past 
</P>
<P>
Dan Williams, an analyst with Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco, told United 
Press International that the offer was slightly higher than he would have 
expected for Shaklee. "I'm a little hard pressed to explain what is the 
attraction of the company," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Shaklee, which sells its products through a international network of 10,000 
independent distributors, has had a colorful past. It was founded in 1956 by 
the late Forrest C. Shaklee Sr., a chiropractor, and his two sons, Raleigh L. 
and Forrest Jr. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, the elder Shaklee pitched the company's products as in 
"harmony with nature," a theme the company continues. But over the years, the 
elder Shaklee was accused of making outrageous health claims about the 
products, and the Food and Drug Administration charged in 1976 that the company 
mislabeled some of its goods. 
</P>
<P>
Motivated by cash, cars and convention trips, Shaklee's sales agents 
traditionally have been very loyal to the company and fervent in their 
recruitment of additional distributors. In recent years, however, the company 
has lost some of its luster. With more women in the work force seeking 
full-time jobs, the company has been hard-pressed to maintain its sales force. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some analysts considered the company's Japanese operations, which 
have accounted for 40% of the company's earnings, among its most valuable 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
The conditional offer from the Jacobs group, which includes Minneapolis 
investor Carl R. Pohlad, has a provision to reduce the price by $20 a share if 
Shaklee actually pays its special dividend to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earnings Improved 
</P>
<P>
David M. Chamberlain, Shaklee's president and chief executive, said the letter 
from Jacobs outlining the takeover proposal had been referred to the company's 
directors. Chamberlain declined additional comment. 
</P>
<P>
Shaklee's sales and earnings improved in 1988 over the prior year, but the 
company's profits were far below what it reported in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Shaklee earned $27.2 million, up 16% from 1987. Sales rose to $627 
million from $572 million in the prior year. The company said the improved 
earnings reflected sales growth in its Bear Creek subsidiary, the nation's 
largest direct mail marketer of fruit and gourmet foods.

TAXPAYERS GET LESS ROSY ESTIMATE ON COST OF S&amp;L BAILOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cost to taxpayers of President Bush's savings and loan rescue plan will be 
at least $84 billion during its first 10 years, more than double the $40 
billion estimated by the White House, the Congressional Budget Office said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
And rising interest rates could drive the taxpayer share to $104 billion or 
more, Acting Director James Blum of the budget office told the Senate Banking 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has estimated that its plan to shut down or sell 
hundreds of insolvent S&amp;Ls will require cash outlays of $157.6 billion in 
its first 10 years, with a cost to taxpayers of $39.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Administration proposal, the program would be financed with premiums 
collected from healthy S&amp;Ls and sales of 30-year bonds, for which the 
Treasury would pay the interest. 
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast, the budget office said Friday that the outlays will reach 
$205 billion, with expenses of $84 billion for the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aggravating the Problem 
</P>
<P>
Blum said Administration estimates failed to reflect the full amount of 
Treasury borrowing needed under the complex financing plan. 
</P>
<P>
Rising interest rates also could boost the cost of the S&amp;L rescue program 
in several ways. Healthy thrifts would suffer declining profits as they are 
forced to pay higher rates of interest on new deposits, compared with the 
interest they receive on old mortgages. This could increase the number of 
S&amp;Ls that become insolvent, adding to the burden. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury also would be forced to pay higher rates of interest on bonds used 
to raise billions of dollars to close insolvent S&amp;Ls and pay off 
depositors. 
</P>
<P>
Under the budget office's interest-rate assumptions, which are more pessimistic 
than official Administration forecasts, the taxpayer share would be as much as 
$104 billion in the first 10 years, the period in which all the crippled 
S&amp;Ls would be closed or sold. 
</P>
<P>
"The sky's the limit," said a worried Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), 
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. "There's a question of honesty in 
budgeting." Under the Administration plan, "we ask you to sign the blank check 
today, and we'll fill in the numbers over the next 30 years.". 
</P>
<P>
If the Bush plan is approved by Congress without changes, "it will lock in the 
government to pay the bill no matter how high it goes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposes 'Blank Check' 
</P>
<P>
Disturbed by the spiraling cost estimates, Riegle has asked government 
officials and outside consultants for detailed economic studies, using 
different assumptions about interest rates and the level of deposits at 
S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a history with this problem of low-balling the estimates," he said in 
an interview Friday. "It's a very unpleasant situation we find ourselves in. I 
don't think many people on the committee want to sign a blank check." 
</P>
<P>
In financing the S&amp;L cleanup, "it may well be that we are going to spend 
more than the Administration has suggested," he said. "But we want to know that 
now. There is a great value in leveling with people at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Although the ultimate cost to taxpayers is uncertain, the federal insurance 
fund that guarantees the safety of S&amp;L deposits up to $100,000 remains 
safe, Riegle said. "The deposit insurance pledges are absolute guarantees." he 
said. "There's no question . . . that the federal insurance system affords 
protection and will always be there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Last Resort 
</P>
<P>
But the new budget office estimate raises the specter of open-ended taxpayer 
contributions to the S&amp;L rescue, a disturbing prospect for Riegle. 
</P>
<P>
"The Treasury is the deep pocket of last resort," he said at the hearing. "If 
the number gets larger, that's where the money is." Congress may "wake up one 
morning and find we have a much larger number on our hands," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Taxpayers must be the last resort for solving the problem because the S&amp;L 
industry has reached the limit of its ability to pay, Riegle said. 
</P>
<P>
Healthy S&amp;Ls already pay premiums into the deposit insurance fund equal to 
about 20% of their profits, and would have to pay more under the Bush plan. 
</P>
<P>
Riegle does not want to impose premiums beyond the level suggested by the 
Administration. "I'm hard-pressed to see how more can be found there" in the 
industry, he said in the interview. "We do not want to construct a plan to work 
in such a way that a number of thrifts now solvent become insolvent. Then the 
cost of the solution gets driven much higher."

L.A. STATION TO DUMP SELECTV, DIMMING PROSPECTS FOR PIONEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
SelecTV has lost its contract with the channel that broadcasts the pioneering 
subscription TV service to 20,000 homes in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
KWHY-TV Channel 22 has decided to broadcast Spanish-language programming April 
1 instead of the movies and sports offered by SelecTV. And while SelecTV 
executives are putting the best face on KWHY's move, some experts predict that 
it could spell the demise of the long-struggling service. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably the end of the road for them, certainly at Channel 22," said 
KWHY President Burt Harris Jr. "Right now they owe us a lot of money, but we're 
keeping them on in return for a minimum daily payment because subscribers are 
still expecting a service." 
</P>
<P>
"SelecTV will be on tonight," Harris said Friday, adding "but only if they pay 
me by 5 o'clock today." SelecTV leases air time from KWHY. 
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for SelecTV countered that "we're definitely going to be 
on tonight and tomorrow night and the night after that." A spokesman for KWHY 
confirmed late Friday that the station had been paid and SelecTV "would be on 
through the weekend." 
</P>
<P>
KWHY will continue to broadcast the Business Channel from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. on 
weekdays, followed by Spanish-language programming from Univisa Inc. 
</P>
<P>
SelecTV President Thomas C. Hunt denied that the loss of the KWHY contract 
would mean the end of the service. According to Hunt, SelecTV is merely in a 
period of transition, converting from broadcast delivery to microwave 
distribution -- what is known in the industry as a multichannel, multipoint 
distribution service, or MMDS. 
</P>
<P>
The change will require the installation of new equipment in subscriber homes, 
he said, and will take several months. The equipment will be provided free to 
SelecTV by the manufacturer in exchange for a percentage of subscriber fees. 
</P>
<P>
"We've informed our subscribers that we are offering a new service that we're 
calling SuperselecTV," Hunt said. "We are beginning conversions this month. We 
feel this is a very positive thing for us. MMDS is a growth industry, the wave 
of the future in wireless cable." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt said the company expects to have 2,000 subscribers converted to the new 
service by the time SelecTV's contract with KWHY is up at the end of the month. 
He acknowledged that "we may lose some subscribers" during the transition, "but 
we're highly confident that some of those people will take a new and better 
service back. We'll take a dip and then go back up again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Struggle to the End' 
</P>
<P>
Larry Gerbrandt, a senior analyst for Paul Kagan Associates, a media research 
firm in Carmel, was less upbeat about SelecTV's prospects. "I don't want to 
predict anyone's demise, but obviously this is a crisis situation." 
</P>
<P>
"Their job is to minimize the loss of subscribers," Gerbrandt said of SelecTV 
management statements. "They have to try. You have to struggle to the very end 
and try to keep the business alive. As long as you have subscribers you can 
probably patch together some sort of service. Then it becomes a question of 
overhead and how many subscribers you lose." 
</P>
<P>
"Multichannel MDS could give them a new lease on life," he said. "It's doable 
and feasible, but it will require additional capital from somewhere. When you 
are day-to-day with all your (supplier) accounts, as I understand they are, 
anything incremental can be very serious." 
</P>
<P>
"They are valiantly trying to save themselves at the 11th hour, but my feeling 
is they are going out of business," said KWHY's Harris. "This isn't a surprise 
to anyone; they've been losing subscribers for years." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when SelecTV merged with its rival pay TV service, On-TV, in 1984, the 
combined company boasted nearly 300,000 subscribers in the Los Angeles area.

<P>
The stock market pieced together a moderate gain Friday in a quiet session. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 8.58 to 2,274.29, stretching its 
gain for the week to 28.75 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 151.79 million shares, down from 
161.98 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Blue chips have been depressed by fears of future rate hikes, which hurt stocks 
by raising corporate borrowing costs and luring investors away to 
interest-bearing assets. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday's trading was listless, analysts said. Blue chips attracted interest 
only because investors sought cheap purchases after last week's 79.28-point Dow 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
"The market just didn't have any gusto today," said market analyst Hugh Johnson 
of First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tug of war in investors' minds between inflation fears and 
recession fears. This indecision caused a directionless market today," said 
Donald Hays, director of investment strategy at Wheat First Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Air, the most active issue on the American Stock Exchange, dropped 1/4 to 
13 as President Bush decided against intervening in the labor dispute involving 
the company's Eastern Airlines subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Among other airline issues, Delta Air Lines gained 1 5/8 to 56 1/4, Pan Am rose 
1/4 to 4 1/4 and NWA climbed 1 1/4 to 69 1/4. But UAL dropped 1 3/8 to 119 and 
AMR was down 1/8 at 58 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
TW Services rose 5/8 to 28 1/2 in active trading. The stock traded lower for 
much of the session on word that a Delaware court upheld the "poison pill" 
defense the company is employing to fight a takeover bid by Coniston Partners. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign trading, Tokyo shares fell amid a slumping bond market after Bank of 
Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said Japan will take adequate, early action to 
maintain stable prices if necessary. The Nikkei 225-share average fell 73.63 to 
32,000.10. 
</P>
<P>
On the London Stock Exchange, shares closed firmer after Wall Street recovered 
from a lower opening. The Financial Times 100-share index closed 19.5 higher at 
2,059.2.

Bond prices were mixed in lackluster trading, finishing little changed despite 
early declines in the face of an overnight drop by the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down 1/16 point late Friday. Its 
yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, was unchanged from 
late Thursday at 9.12%. 
</P>
<P>
After surging Thursday, bond prices opened sharply lower in response to the 
dollar's decline overnight in foreign exchange overseas, analysts said. A 
declining dollar hurts bond prices by reducing yields available to foreign 
investors, who are sizeable holders of dollar-denominated debt. 
</P>
<P>
The market recovered some ground after reports that Venezuela was making 
payments on its $33-billion foreign debt conditional on the success of its 
government austerity program. The dollar finished lower, but did not drag the 
bond market with it, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9.50%, down from 9.813% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
The dollar declined against several key currencies in domestic dealings after a 
mixed performance overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $386.30 
for an ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EST, up from $383.50 late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers described trading as trendless, with little news to influence 
the dollar's movement. However, they said a sentiment persisted among market 
participants that efforts to relieve inflationary pressures, including 
increases in interest rates, may affect exchange rates soon. 
</P>
<P>
"The market was basically featureless the last few days," said Kevin Laurie, 
manager of foreign exchange trading at the Bank of Boston operation in New 
York. "We're waiting for some information to push the dollar out of the recent 
range." 
</P>
<P>
In European currency markets, dealers said the Bank of England bought sterling 
several times during the session in a bid to maintain the British currency's 
exchange rate, but the action failed to prevent a fall. 
</P>
<P>
The pound ended the London business day at $1.7240, cheaper for buyers than 
Thursday's $1.7270 and its lowest level in London since Oct. 11. But later, in 
New York, sterling fetched $1.72025, up from $1.7125 in New York on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to Thursday's levels, included: 
1.8437 West German marks, down from 1.8474; 1.57515 Swiss francs, down from 
1.5824; 1.19505 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19485; 6.2645 French francs, down 
from 6.2880, and 1,358.00 Italian lire, down from 1,361.33. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 128.12 Japanese yen, up from 128.07 yen 
late Thursday. In London, the dollar was trading lower, at 127.98 yen, and at 
127.815 yen in New York, down from 128.435 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Persistent supply concerns pushed copper futures prices sharply higher on New 
York's Commodity Exchange, capping a weeklong rally that boosted copper by more 
than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
On other exchanges, precious metals also advanced; energy futures retreated; 
pork bellies plummeted, leading livestock futures lower, and grains and 
soybeans were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Copper settled 2.4 cents to 5.6 cents higher, with the most active contract, 
for delivery in May, at $1.437 a pound. The spot March contract finished at 
$1.53 a pound, to $1.386 a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Prices rose despite an apparent reduction in tensions between Peruvian copper 
miners and the government. 
</P>
<P>
In Peru, the world's sixth-largest copper-producing nation, the National 
Federation of Mine Workers continued plans for a 3-day "warning strike" 
beginning March 26. The miners contend that the government has not honored the 
agreement that ended a 57-day strike late last year. 
</P>
<P>
The union said friday that it was willing to accept some compromises in the 
interim before the strike, although workers did not rule out possibly extending 
the strike beyond three days. 
</P>
<P>
Copper's underlying supply-and-demand factors remained overwhelmingly bullish, 
with near-term availability extremely limited going into the second quarter, 
historically a period of heavy consumption.

STOCK MANIPULATION PROBED IN LINCOLN S&amp;L SALE

A Cincinnati brokerage has been subpoenaed by federal investigators looking 
into possible stock manipulation involving American Continental of Phoenix and 
its efforts to sell Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
But the head of Queen City Securities said the firm was not itself a target of 
a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into questionable trading of 
American Continental stock. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't done anything wrong. We are cooperating with the SEC in any way we 
can," said H. Garrett Frey, Queen City's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Although SEC representative Mary McCue would not confirm or deny that a probe 
is under way, the National Assn. of Securities Dealers has confirmed that both 
it and the SEC are investigating, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
"We are reviewing trading in the stock," said Enno Hobbing, an association vice 
president. His agency oversees the national over-the-counter securities market 
on which American Continental is traded. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental's common stock, which sold for more than $7 a share just 2 
weeks ago, has plummeted to nearly $3. The firm's preferred stock also has 
declined in price, selling at around $6.50 share in recent trading after 
holding steady just weeks ago at more than $10. 
</P>
<P>
That drop has been blamed on persistent rumors that plans by the Arizona firm 
to sell Lincoln had run aground. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, American Continental said that its agreement to sell the 
thrift to a Los Angeles investor group headed by veteran thrift executive 
Spencer Scott had expired. The firm said it would continue to negotiate with 
the Scott group while entertaining bids from other suitors. 
</P>
<P>
"We are certainly willing to work with Scott, but we will be looking very 
closely at other sale options as well," American Continental Chairman Charles 
H. Keating Jr. said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles confirmed 
this week that Lincoln is involved in a criminal fraud investigation. A 
spokesman for the office declined to discuss the matter, however. It was not 
clear if that investigation was related to the SEC inquiry.

<P>
The government reported Friday that its chief economic forecasting gauge posted 
its second straight sharp gain in January, rising 0.6%, but analysts expect the 
strong economic picture to fade later this year. 
</P>
<P>
January's rise in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators followed a 0.7% 
increase in December, providing fresh evidence that 1989 opened on a strong 
note despite widespread expectations of an impending slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
The index, designed to foretell economic activity six to nine months into the 
future, was up and down during much of last year. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate report released Friday, the government said orders to U.S. 
factories for manufactured goods declined 1.3% in January, reflecting a 
fallback in demand for transportation equipment from record levels a month 
earlier. Analysts said that despite the overall decline, the report provided 
evidence of continued economic strength. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding transportation, orders were up 0.2% in January after a 1.8% rise in 
December. And the category of non-defense capital goods, viewed as a barometer 
of future industry investment plans, rose 1.6% in January to $40.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said January's rise in the 
index of leading indicators "shows a moderate level of growth which we believe 
is conducive to a healthy economy." 
</P>
<P>
However, analysts cautioned that the latest signs of robust economic activity 
could heighten concerns that the economy is speeding ahead too quickly to 
contain inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
That, in turn, could increase the risk of a recession by causing the Federal 
Reserve Board to act too aggressively as it pushes up interest rates in an 
effort to slow the economy and restrain inflation, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fed is very concerned that we're overheating and that we're not going to 
get inflation under control," said economist John Hagens of the Wefa Group, a 
forecasting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. "I think there is a risk that we'll 
overreact to the data and push ourselves into a recession in the latter part of 
this year or in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Irwin Kellner, chief economist for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York, 
said the Fed's efforts to restrain inflation by tightening its grip on the 
money supply "could very easily bring on an unwanted recession." 
</P>
<P>
The Fed, for its part, maintains that its inflation-fighting strategy is 
designed to ensure that the next recession, when it comes, will not be severe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contributing Elements 
</P>
<P>
January's leading index report was the first to be released in a revised format 
in which the Commerce Department dropped two of 11 components from the 
composite index, revised two others and added two new indicators. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the 11 indicators advanced in January, with an increase in the index 
of consumer optimism making the biggest positive contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Other factors pulling the index up were rising stock prices; increased raw 
materials prices, signaling high demand; a longer average work week; slower 
vendor deliveries to companies, indicating strong demand; an increase in 
manufacturers' unfilled orders; a drop in initial claims for unemployment 
benefits and more orders for new plants and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Three indicators made negative contributions, including a contraction in the 
money supply. Other negative factors were a decline in manufacturer orders for 
consumer goods and fewer building permits. 
</P>
<P>
The various changes left the index at 145.7% of its 1982 base of 100. Over the 
past 12 months, the index has climbed 5%, compared to a 1.8% gain during the 
previous 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the latest signs of strength in the economy, analysts continue to 
forecast slower growth during 1989, particularly during the second half of the 
year. They said January's outlook may have been artificially boosted by mild 
winter weather that led to more housing and sales activity than normal. 
</P>
<P>
The manufactured goods report released by the Commerce Department showed that 
orders for durable and non-durable products fell to a seasonally adjusted 
$235.8 billion in January after posting a 4.7% increase in December. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first decline in factory orders since a 1.9% drop in September. 
</P>
<P>
The decline was attributed to a retreat in demand for ships, tanks and planes 
that resulted in an 8.5% decline in orders for transportation equipment last 
month. The category had surged 22.1% during the previous month to a record 
$39.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The motor vehicle, aircraft and shipbuilding industries all had posted large 
gains in December. 
</P>
<P>
Defense orders, subject to wide swings depending on when contracts are signed, 
plunged 33.9% in January to $6.9 billion after a 24% surge in December. 
</P>
<P>
For all of 1988, orders for manufacturers' goods were up 9.7%, the best showing 
since 1979, after posting a 7.1% gain during 1987. 
</P>
<P>
American manufacturing was bolstered by strong demand for exports in the past 
two years as the decline in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies 
made U.S. products more competitive in the international marketplace.

7-UP Parodies Coke, Pepsi: While Diet Coke and Pepsi continue to take 
commercial pokes at each other, Diet 7-UP has decided to parody both of them in 
a new TV campaign that will break Monday. But unlike the Pepsi and Diet Coke 
ads -- which flaunt major rocks stars and 3-D technology -- one 15-second 7-UP 
ad even features an announcer who mocks the competition when he confesses, "No 
big rocks stars here." According to recent research data, Diet Coke is the 
biggest selling diet soft drink in the U.S., with 7% of the market, with Diet 
Pepsi second at 5.3% and 7-UP third, with 1.6%.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE BOMB: CASTING A LONG SHADOW; 
</P>
<P>
CBS' 'DAY ONE,' TNT'S 'NIGHTBREAKER' RELIVE MORAL DILEMMAS OF ATOMIC AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, Time Television Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When humans are incinerated, only their shadows remain. 
</P>
<P>
It's something to contemplate while watching "Day One," a terrifically good, 
finely acted, strikingly detailed and inevitably horrifying account of the race 
to develop the atomic bomb. The three-hour Aaron Spelling production airs at 8 
p.m. Sunday on CBS (Channels 2 and 8). 
</P>
<P>
And arriving at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. Wednesday on the new TNT cable network are 
consecutive showings of "Nightbreaker," a devastating new movie about American 
soldiers victimized by the Army's atomic testing program in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"Day One" and "Nightbreaker": both historical dramas directly relating to the 
present, both excellent reasons to watch TV this week. 
</P>
<P>
The CBS work is a highly successful collaboration by writer/producer David 
Rintels and director Joseph Sargent on a story based on Peter Wyden's book, 
"Day One: Before Hiroshima and After." It features superb performances by David 
Strathairn, Brian Dennehy and Michael Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
"Day One" may offer no significant new insights -- PBS viewers gained more 
intimate knowledge in 1982 from the British series "Oppenheimer" -- but it does 
compellingly relive the passions, enigmas and complexities of the Manhattan 
Project, which joined thousands of scientists, engineers and craftsmen in a 
quest for a superweapon that would quickly end World War II. 
</P>
<P>
It also acutely and eloquently articulates the moral and political dilemmas 
underpinning the development of The Bomb. And in doing so, it dramatizes the 
sometimes conflicting goals of science and humanity. 
</P>
<P>
An impressive package. 
</P>
<P>
The setting for most of the story is Los Alamos, N.M., in the early 1940s. The 
state of mind is worry that Germany may be ahead of the United States in atomic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The main protagonists are J. Robert Oppenheimer (Strathairn), the brilliant 
physicist from Berkeley, and Major Gen. Leslie R. Groves (Dennehy), the blunt, 
forceful, overbearing head of the Manhattan Project who hires "Oppie" to direct 
the Los Alamos bomb laboratory because he's virtually the only scientist he 
trusts and can communicate with. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the atomic research itself is at times drowned out by a rising buzz 
of bickering inside the White House and the divided scientific community. The 
deafening sound of clashing egos, agendas and ideologies is ultimately exceeded 
only by that first atomic explosion in the desert on July 16, 1945, as 
Oppenheimer equates the terrifying majesty before him with those oft-quoted 
words from the Bhagavad-Gita: "I am become death, the shatterer of worlds." 
</P>
<P>
This seemingly lamenting thought about the bomb from Oppenheimer is in conflict 
with the political player, ambitious opportunist and centered pragmatist we see 
earlier. When fellow scientist (and future Nobel Prize-winner) Enrico Fermi 
suggests that the United States somehow drop atomic material on Germany to 
contaminate the food supply, Oppenheimer coolly adds that the plan would be 
impractical if there were fewer than 500,000 casualties. 
</P>
<P>
The question of whether to measure weaponry by the territory it obliterates or 
the humanity it kills or maims is ever-present -- and unanswered -- in "Day 
One." The arguments for and against dropping the bomb on Japan -- and by what 
method -- spill out in fascinating White House dialogues that broadly define a 
morality debate that endures even today. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest dissenting voice in "Day One" is that of physicist Leo Szilard 
(Michael Tucker). He is the Hungarian refugee whose relentless second-guessing 
about the bomb and warnings of a future destructive arms race earn the wrath of 
the seething, tyrannical Groves and put him in conflict with hawkish Secretary 
of State James Byrnes (Hume Cronyn). 
</P>
<P>
By this time, however, the race to complete a bomb has taken on a separate life 
-- a weapon for its own sake -- with Groves worrying that the war will end 
"before we are ready to drop it." 
</P>
<P>
The setting for "Nightbreaker" is hardly more than a decade later, in Camp 
Mercury, Nev., where the Army had been exposing GI volunteers to "low-level" 
radiation in nuclear bomb tests since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the book "Atomic Soldiers" by Howard L. Rosenberg (no relation to 
this reviewer), "Nightbreaker" stars Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez in an 
angry, disturbing story of betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
The betrayers are the government and the Army. The betrayed are the soldiers 
who volunteered for the tests and were misled about the dangers they faced 
("Soldier, you'll be OK"), which were intended to gauge the impact of nuclear 
blasts on combat troops. 
</P>
<P>
Sheen and Estevez (who are father and son) are excellent as older and younger 
versions of fictional neurologist Alexander Brown, whose participation in these 
tests with troops -- many of whom later suffered sterility, amputations and 
even premature death -- comes back to haunt him. He gets romance and morality 
lectures from government worker Sally Matthews (Lea Thompson). 
</P>
<P>
Writer T. S. Cook and director Peter Markle bring a controlled rage to this 
material. The story is suspenseful, provocative and excruciatingly real, with 
one of the characters, Sgt. Jack Russell (Joe Pantoliano), based on real-life 
Camp Mercury veteran Russell Jack Dann, a central character in the Rosenberg 
book who suffered multiple amputations and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike elements of "Day One," the tightly focused TNT movie doesn't indict the 
bomb, only the government for deceiving American soldiers about potentially 
lethal fallout and then not accepting responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there are some sequences here, showing the effects of a blast on mannequins 
and then live pigs, that speak for themselves. They are absolutely harrowing, 
recalling the atom bombs that fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 and also 
that first fateful detonation at Los Alamos. 
</P>

If Aaron Spelling has heard the question once, he has heard it a dozen times. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are you doing a show like this?" 
</P>
<P>
The program in question this time is "Day One," a three-hour TV movie presented 
by AT&amp;T and produced by Aaron Spelling Productions about the U.S. decision 
to develop and drop the world's first atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Written by Emmy Award-winner David Rintels, directed by veteran Joe Sargent and 
sporting a cast that includes Brian Dennehy and Hume Cronyn from "Cocoon," 
Michael Tucker and Richard Dysart from "L. A. Law," and David Straithairn from 
"Eight Men Out," the project -- which airs on CBS at 8 p.m. Sunday -- is a far 
cry from the shows for which Spelling is best known: "The Love Boat," 
"Charlie's Angels," "Dynasty," "Fantasy Island," "Mod Squad," "Starsky &amp; 
Hutch." 
</P>
<P>
Spelling is the first to complain that he never gets proper credit for the 
other programs he has made, such as the series "Family" and TV movies about 
anorexia nervosa ("Best Little Girl in the World") and drug addiction 
("Cracked-Up"). 
</P>
<P>
"You can't win. You just can't win," Spelling said, shaking his head sadly. "If 
you try to do something better than 'SWAT,' for example, instead of giving you 
credit for it, people say, 'What right does he have to do that?' " 
</P>
<P>
Even Rintels admits he was put off by Spelling's flash-and-trash reputation 
when he was first approached to write the script for "Day One" by Bill Haber, 
the two men's mutual agent at Creative Artists Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"The first question I asked was whether I would have creative autonomy. And I 
received assurances that I would," explained Rintels, whose television credits 
include such meaty specials as "Sakharov," "Clarence Darrow," "Fear on Trial" 
and "Gideon's Trumpet." 
</P>
<P>
But it was Spelling who first had the idea to make the TV movie after reading 
"Day One: Before Hiroshima and After" by Peter Wyden in 1984. His reaction, he 
recalled, was "Wow. Wow. Wow." 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, he thought about adapting the book for television. But did viewers 
need yet another drama about the atomic bomb? Spelling looked for the answer 
within his own family. 
</P>
<P>
"I found out that my daughter, who was 10 at the time, really knew very little 
about why the atomic bomb was built, who started it, what it did to Japan. And 
even though I think I read a lot, I realized that I never knew the real reason 
that we developed the bomb. And it was then that I said, 'Hey, can we buy this 
book?' " 
</P>
<P>
Spelling got hold of the galleys and immediately enlisted Rintels to write the 
script and co-produce the project. 
</P>
<P>
"The atomic bomb has dominated politics and international relations and debates 
on morality and philosophy for the last 40-odd years," Rintels said. "And it is 
still such a central part of all our lives that I can't imagine that there's a 
more important story than this." 
</P>
<P>
But getting someone to finance production was "a very, very hard sell," 
Spelling said. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran producer was still under contract to ABC at the time, so he was 
obligated to take the project there first, even though he knew the network 
already had aired the movie "The Day After" and was unlikely to want to do 
another film about nuclear weapons so soon. 
</P>
<P>
"They just weren't interested in it," Spelling said. "Then we took it to CBS, 
and they were fascinated." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt aware that PBS already had aired a 7-part BBC series, "Oppenheimer," 
that covered much of the same ground, however, CBS wanted to cut "Day One" from 
three hours to two. 
</P>
<P>
Then his agents took it to AT&amp;T, which decided to fully underwrite the 
project as the third in its series of "AT&amp;T Presents" specials. 
</P>
<P>
"Without AT&amp;T saying, 'We want to do this with you,' we would never have 
gotten it on," Spelling said. 
</P>
<P>
Rintels said that he based his script not only on Wyden's book but also on two 
dozen other volumes about the period when The Manhattan Project was underway. 
</P>
<P>
He took care, he said, "to write this not from a 1980s perspective but from a 
1940s perspective, when people were living in a very different world when there 
were specific practical and political dimensions beyond morality that were part 
of the debate over using the bomb." 
</P>
<P>
To keep an eye on the historical accuracy of the movie, the producers enlisted 
the help of James MacGregor Burns, a senior fellow at the Williams College 
Center for the Humanities and Social Sciences and the author of a trilogy on 
American history, "The American Experiment." 
</P>
<P>
Calling the movie "wonderfully authentic," Burns maintains that any controversy 
that results from its broadcast probably will center not on the film itself but 
on the U.S. decision to drop the bomb on Japan and usher in the nuclear age. 
</P>
<P>
To Burns, the film portrays what he calls the "horrible calculus of death" -- 
the weighing of how many lives would be lost by dropping the bomb versus how 
many would be lost if the United States were to invade Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of agonizing over whether to use the bomb, and the film 
dramatizes the different points of view very effectively," he said. "It shows 
people fumbling and feeling their way to a decision. But I think there still 
will be a question in the minds of some viewers as to whether dropping the bomb 
was necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Spelling denies that he wanted to make "Day One" in a bid for a career-crowning 
Emmy. But he also acknowledges that he didn't do it to win big ratings, 
especially up against Robin Givens in the ABC movie "Penthouse." 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a chance -- and I hope this doesn't sound pretentious," 
Spelling said, "that maybe a modicum of the audience that likes my shows will 
say, 'Well, let's watch it. It's one of his.' Whereas maybe if some other 
company were presenting 'Day One,' they wouldn't. Because good, bad or 
indifferent, my name is synonymous with entertainment."

CRITIC AT LARGE: WHEN A HOLLYWOOD MANAGER FEELS LIKE A 'WORKING GIRL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ties that bind in Hollywood have the tensile strength of overboiled 
spaghetti, and some ties are even more fragile than others. 
</P>
<P>
With few exceptions, the tie between actor and press agent is probably the most 
fragile of all. The press agents are in a no-win situation -- fired if they do 
too little, dropped if they do so well that the actor can afford a larger, 
glossier agency or figures that he no longer needs publicity at all. 
</P>
<P>
The link between actor and personal manager is almost as fragile and for much 
the same reasons. The slow nurturing of a career either pays off not at all or 
succeeds so well that the actor presumes to fly alone and would as soon not be 
reminded of his or her previous condition of servitude and dependency. 
</P>
<P>
The glittering performances that win Academy Award nominations, of course, rest 
atop a vast undergirding of executives, lawyers, agents and managers. 
</P>
<P>
Personal managers are probably the least known members of the Hollywood 
firmament. They operate in a loosely defined realm of career guidance that is 
distinct from the work of the agents, who sell, the business managers who 
oversee the money side and the press agents who bang the drums, not slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Carlyle is a personal manager who had what began as a very happy day 
when this year's Academy Award nominations were announced. She was the 
co-executive producer, with John Malkovich, of "The Accidental Tourist," one of 
the nominated best pictures. She manages Willem Dafoe, who co-starred in 
"Mississippi Burning," another of the nominated films. Malkovich himself 
co-starred in "Dangerous Liaisons," a third nominated film. And, until that 
week, she had for nearly nine years managed Melanie Griffith, who was nominated 
as best actress for "Working Girl," fourth of the five nominated films. 
</P>
<P>
But Griffith had ended the association with a five-line note, which Carlyle 
opened when she returned from a trip the day of the nominations. The note hoped 
that they would always be friends. It is a fair speculation that Griffith's 
renewed association with Don Johnson might have been a factor in the dismissal 
of Carlyle. Griffith now shares Johnson's attorney and press agent and 
presumably has all the support system she feels she needs. 
</P>
<P>
Carlyle is disappointed but philosophical. "At the time she became a client, 
nobody would take Melanie seriously. She had a lot of problems. I offered 
friendship, support and advice. I sent her to New York to study. She began to 
work again. Along the way she had other personal problems that we had to work 
past. She felt she was able to overcome all of it and now, I think, she wants 
to show that she's a star and she probably feels some resentment at having to 
be grateful." 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier Hollywood the studios shaped the careers of their contract 
players, teaching them to act, fence, dance, sing and, within limits, to 
behave. The players were brought along if they proved to have an it audiences 
responded to. The end of contract rosters in the television era left actors 
without the kind of career guidance the studios had provided. Personal managers 
now try to fill the vacuum. If she has a talent, Carlyle says, it is in 
identifying actors who have whatever it is. 
</P>
<P>
She was born in Cleveland, the daughter of Russ Carlyle, a well-known band 
leader in the Big Band era. She moved to Chicago and started a talent agency 
for commercials, handling models for catalogues and print ads and actors for 
voice-over work. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 years she sold her agency, A-Plus, and moved to Los Angeles. The idea 
of making movies had already appealed to her. She began again in commercial 
casting and says she found Ted Danson his first commercial. "I got Steve 
Guttenberg his SAG card," Carlyle says. 
</P>
<P>
Carlyle was by no means the first personal manager; there are dozens. But with 
her agency, Carlyle Casting, well-established she decided to move into managing 
because by now she knew so many promising talents in need of guidance. 
</P>
<P>
Her first client was an actor pal, Jamie Widdoes, who is now going into 
directing. Griffith, nine years ago, was an early client. Back in Chicago six 
years ago, a friend took her to see John Malkovich in "True West" and he became 
a client. After a couple of years, she says, "We traded labels and became a 
producing partnership," ending the manager-client relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Among her other clients are Willem Dafoe, Andy Garcia, Donna Mills, Geena Davis 
(nominated for her supporting role in "The Accidental Tourist"), Chris Sarandon 
and the director John Frankenheimer among others. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago an agent had shown Malkovich a copy of "The Accidental Tourist" 
and the partners persuaded Warner Bros. to buy it for them. Frank Galati was 
hired to do a script, and the original idea was for Malkovich and Melanie 
Griffith to co-star. 
</P>
<P>
But the course of true Hollywood never runs smooth. The original Warners 
executive left within weeks after the property was acquired. There were 
creative differences with a director brought into the project. Malkovich was 
committed to "Burn This" on stage and then to "Dangerous Liaisons." Lawrence 
Kasdan came aboard and was set to find someone to co-star with Griffith when 
"Working Girl" became available for her. So "The Accidental Tourist" ended up 
as a Kasdan-William Hurt-Geena Davis vehicle, with pleasing consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Carlyle is now developing another Anne Tyler book -- her most recent, 
"Breathing Lessons" -- for Columbia and has two other projects that appear 
likely to go this spring, one in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
She is expanding her role as a personal manager to embrace more directors and 
writers. "They find they don't have anyone to bounce off any more either," 
Carlyle says. "They want a shaping hand, need a shaping hand, especially if 
what you're all after is excellence."

TRAINS, PLANES AND AUTOS FOR HOBBYISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Engines -- albeit tiny ones -- will roar this weekend at the County Fairgrounds 
in Pomona, where the two-day Los Angeles Model Hobby Show will showcase 
radio-controlled planes, cars, boats, trains and just about everything else 
that can be guided by human hand. 
</P>
<P>
From 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. today and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday, about 200 
suppliers will demonstrate state-of-the-art radio control (R/C to tens of 
thousands of hobbyists) vehicles, engines and accessories on a number of tracks 
as large as 30x50 feet; in the air; on the water and on mini-railroad tracks 
accommodating O-, N- and HO-scale models. 
</P>
<P>
With California leading the way, the hobby market is said to have quadrupled in 
the last four years. "Buggy race-car tracks, trends in airplane design, outdoor 
railroads . . . they all originated in California," says Ron Hieb, an industry 
spokesman from Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Hieb also noted that simpler model kits have made R/C less intimidating for 
beginners: "The trend toward ARF (almost ready to fly -- but the term is 
applied to boats and cars too) has helped bring lots of novices into the hobby, 
because a minimum of technical knowledge or construction skill is required. 
Once a modeler develops a basic understanding of R/C, he or she often goes on 
to more complex projects." 
</P>
<P>
Typical of recent advances in R/C is something called TBS-103, for Track Block 
Supervisor, a product of Industrial Computer Designs of Westlake Village. With 
the TBS, explains company president Michael Ragsdale, one model train will slow 
down or even stop if it gets too close to a train ahead of it, just as on real 
railroads. 
</P>
<P>
With gadgetry limited only by people's ingenuity, the show remains a favorite 
of hobbyists: "People just like to make things move," Hieb says, "it's as 
simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
Admission is $5 for adults, $2.50 for children 6 through 12, free for 5 and 
younger. 
</P>

GARDENING: DABBLING IN DAFFODILS AT DESCANSO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH CHRISTIAN, Christian is a Times copy editor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who has traveled to the Pacific Northwest in spring has seen one of the 
region's most glorious sights -- huge yellow daffodils, thousands of them, 
glowing in the fog as if lighted from within. 
</P>
<P>
Many Southern Californians have come home from such trips eager to grow those 
splendid flowers in their gardens. Come fall, they rush out, buy two dozen of 
the King Alfred bulbs they saw blooming in such profusion in Washington and 
Oregon, plant them and wait for success. And they're almost invariably 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are the blossoms not as spectacular here, the King Alfred usually 
performs well only during the first year it's planted. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're happy with the King Alfred's blossoms that first year, be satisfied 
and throw out the bulbs," says Polly Anderson, a lifelong gardener and a 
founding member of the Southern California Daffodil Society. "However, part of 
(the society's) ambition is to find varieties that do well in Southern 
California -- and that means ones that will naturalize." 
</P>
<P>
This weekend at Descanso Gardens, you'll have the opportunity to see daffodils 
that do do well in Southern California; so well, in fact, that they will often 
naturalize -- in other words, make themselves right at home in your garden and 
come back year after year without much effort on your part. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who is an expert on creating new strains through cross-pollination, 
says Peeping Tom and February Gold are daffodils that do particularly well in 
this area. Both are yellow and both have blooms on the small side. 
</P>
<P>
"The white ones, in general, don't do as well here as the yellow ones, but the 
blends of yellow and white do fine," she says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sun Lovers 
</P>
<P>
She suggests planting the bulbs in a sunny location in September or October. 
Set them six to eight inches deep and add a good, low-nitrogen granulated 
fertilizer to the planting hole. Then water the bed moderately but regularly. 
You won't see their sunny faces until early spring. 
</P>
<P>
"When the green spikes peek out of the ground, begin watering heavily," 
Anderson says. "It's really hard to over-water when daffodils are in their 
fast-growing and blooming stages." Give them another good feeding when they 
begin to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Then, enjoy. With luck and a little cold weather, you'll have blooms for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
After the blossoms are gone, let the greens rest until they bend over and lose 
all traces of green. When they're completely brown, cut them off at ground 
level and resume a light watering schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Daffodils like the company of other plants in the garden and don't mind poking 
up through annuals. "A lot of old-timers plant the daffodils right in their 
lawns, where they'll naturalize. Then they just leave them there," Anderson 
says. "We even know one fine grower who lets the weeds grow around his 
daffodils as a natural mulch, which he doesn't pull until the blossoms are 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wide Selection of Bulbs 
</P>
<P>
Local nurseries typically have a good selection of daffodil bulbs on hand 
during planting season -- but, again, don't be hoodwinked by the spectacular 
photos on the King Alfred boxes. You might also want to write for a catalogue 
from Grant Mitsch Novelty Daffodils, P.O. Box 218, Hubbard, Ore. 97032 -- 
you'll see varieties that never are available through retail outlets here, and 
the catalogue does note which strains are well-suited for Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All in the Family 
</P>
<P>
The daffodil, like the jonquil, is a member of the narcissus group and all are 
part of the amaryllis family; many members of the family thrive in Southern 
California. Anderson is particularly fond of the paper-white narcissus, which 
smell divine and naturalize beautifully. Because of our cool February, many 
narcissus are still in bloom, and some will be on display during the 
competition at Descanso Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Daffodil Society Competition, today from 1:30 to 4 p.m. 
and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Descanso Gardens in La Canada Flintridge, 
will feature 200-300 different kinds of daffodils, from old favorites such as 
Tete-a-Tete, a miniature yellow trumpet, to strains so new that you won't find 
them in any catalogue. Although there is no additional fee for viewing the 
competition, general admission to the gardens is $3; seniors 62 and older and 
students with ID $1.50; children 5-12, 75 cents; 4 and younger are free. 
</P>
<P>
A number of classes on growing the daffodils, including sessions on 
cross-pollination, will be featured throughout the two-day competition.

WEEKEND CHECKLIST FOR DIGGERS AND PLANTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen: 
</P>
<P>
Prune fuchsias, pelargoniums and geraniums now for fuller plants with more 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Protect newly planted annuals from the onslaught of snails and slugs. Be 
generous and make regular applications of bait throughout the flower bed. 
</P>
<P>
If the weather in your area permits, get your vegetables in as soon as possible 
and extend your harvest by planting at two- to three-week intervals. 
</P>
<P>
Consider planting tuberous begonias soon. Their large, colorful flowers will 
dazzle you this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Keep a lookout for aphids on your roses and keep them in check. 
</P>
<P>
Prune wisteria heavily after it finishes blooming this spring. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a notion to move any azaleas or camellias, now is the time. Dig 
them up and replant in a new spot in richly prepared soil and keep thoroughly 
watered.

ENTERTAINMENT ALONG THE WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many events will supplement the L.A. Marathon activity this weekend. In 
addition to participation in the marathon by a celebrity running team (all in 
support of charities), there will be community entertainment along the route, 
and stereo equipment installed at 10 locations will provide music to inspire 
the runners and spectators. 
</P>
<P>
KCOP-TV Channel 13 will provide live national television coverage, including 
activities at the start-finish location on Figueroa Street, north of the Los 
Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Activities at that location will be in full swing 
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., with music, dance and food booths. 
</P>
<P>
For some, the festivities get under way today in Beverly Hills, where an 
International Breakfast Run gets moving at 8 a.m. Entering the event are 
runners from around the world who have arrived to participate in Sunday's 
marathon. Flags of 50 countries will be carried through the streets of Beverly 
Hills, beginning and ending at the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Beverly 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, from 6:30 to 9:30, Westside Pavilion is the site for a "Carbo-Load" 
party. Competitors in the marathon will be there to stock up on carbohydrates: 
One thousand pounds of pasta have been ordered to feed from 3,500-5,000 hungry 
runners and their families. Entertainers include Olivia Newton-John, comic Paul 
Rodriguez, the Raiderettes and various musical groups. Tickets, at $10 each, 
can be purchased today at the L.A. Marathon Health &amp; Fitness Expo at the 
Airport Hilton Hotel, or at the door if available. 
</P>
<P>
Closer to home (for many) will be 10 entertainment centers positioned about 
every 2 miles along the marathon route on Sunday. The diverse cultural sights 
and sounds of Los Angeles neighborhoods will be featured.

A table accompanying a story on minority contracting at Southern California 
utilities contained 1987 and 1988 spending figures that were in error. The 
numbers shown should have been expressed "in thousands." For example, 1987 
spending on white-male owned firms would be $4,040,136,000, not $4,040,136 as 
shown.

RENEWED TAKEOVER RUMORS GIVE LOCKHEED STOCK BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The price of Lockheed shares rose $1.75 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange 
on renewed rumors that aerospace giant Boeing Co. may try to buy its 
Calabasas-based defense contracting rival. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed closed at $49.50 on volume of about 757,100 shares -- compared to 
Thursday's 234,900 -- after Business Week magazine's "Inside Wall Street" 
stock-tip column quoted unidentified sources as saying that Boeing, based in 
Seattle, is keenly interested in Lockheed's defense contracting business. 
</P>
<P>
Reports that Boeing is interested in Lockheed are not new. The company has been 
the subject of periodic takeover rumors in recent years, and analysts said they 
do not give much credence to the new report. They noted that Wall Street's 
reaction also indicated skepticism in that the stock did not advance to its 
52-week high of $50.125. 
</P>
<P>
"I would sell Lockheed stock while it's up," said Paul H. Nisbet, an analyst 
with Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. Lockheed is not likely to agree 
to a takeover, he said, "and I can't imagine Boeing going after Lockheed or 
anyone else on a hostile basis." 
</P>
<P>
Nisbet explained that hostile takeovers among defense contractors are extremely 
rare -- in part because the Pentagon would vigorously protest any action that 
might disrupt the business of one of its prime suppliers. LINDA WILLIAMS

BILL TO CONSOLIDATE ALL COUNTY TRANSIT AGENCIES IS OFFERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislation that would create a new "superagency," accountable to the public 
for county transportation problems and solutions, was introduced Friday in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The bill by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) would consolidate the 
county's transit and transportation agencies into the Orange County 
Transportation Authority. Its board of directors would consist of 3 county 
supervisors, 7 city representatives, a member of the public and a non-voting 
gubernatorial appointee. 
</P>
<P>
A committee of two representatives each from the Orange County Transportation 
Commission, the Orange County Transit District and the county's League of 
Cities has been studying the proposed merger. At least two committee members, 
one from the OCTD and one who sits on both the OCTD board of directors and the 
OCTC, strongly opposed any move that would end the independence of the OCTD, 
which handles 35 million bus passenger boardings per year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asked Introduction of Bill 
</P>
<P>
But with pressure mounting to establish a single agency to solve transportation 
problems, the committee 2 weeks ago asked Bergeson to introduce legislation 
necessary to bring about a merger. 
</P>
<P>
The state Senate is expected to begin hearings on the measure, SB 838, within 
30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson said it may take a year or more to gain passage of her bill, which 
will be carried in the Assembly by Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
"Although the entire framework of the bill is still being negotiated, we felt 
it was important to introduce this measure in order to demonstrate our 
commitment to the effort toward consolidation," Bergeson said at a Friday news 
conference in Santa Ana called to announce the legislation. "Throughout my 
Senate district, constituents are begging for something to be done about our 
transportation problems." 
</P>
<P>
She added: "It is my belief that consolidation, leading to greater 
coordination, will result in both cost-savings and better efficiency in 
determining the future of transportation in Orange County. . . . Another 
significant benefit is the prospect of Orange County speaking with one voice on 
our transportation needs." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the OCTC and OCTD have occasionally clashed on transportation 
issues in Sacramento. Public opinion surveys sponsored by the OCTC also show 
that the public is confused by the county's "alphabet soup" regarding 
transportation-related agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Roger Stanton, who is both chairman of the OCTD board of directors 
and a member of the OCTC, attended the news conference in support of the bill. 
However, he emphasized that he was doing so as an individual because the 
transit district board is bitterly divided and has not taken a position on the 
proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
Without identifying them by name, Stanton criticized OCTD board members Richard 
B. Edgar and William Farris, who have protested that a new agency and board 
would not be suited to managing the day-to-day operations of a bus company. 
Stanton said the five-member board has two members strongly opposed to 
consolidation and three who are "quite logical" and "open-minded." 
</P>
<P>
Stanton charged that the county transit district duplicates some services 
offered by other agencies, especially in connection with transit service for 
the handicapped and seniors. 
</P>
<P>
He said some members of agency boards and staff people would strongly oppose a 
merger because they would lose their jobs. For example, there are now three 
executive directors whose jobs would be combined into one position. "Who's 
going to take charge?" Stanton asked. 
</P>
<P>
Stanton said he is willing to give up one of his agency posts but said others 
are not. While Stanton and Edgar sit on both OCTC and OCTD boards, others sit 
only on one board and their fate in a merger is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Farris and Edgar could not be reached for comment Friday, but Edgar recently 
accused merger supporters of acting too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Transportation Corridor Agencies, which are supervising 
construction of three tollways in southern Orange County, are not expected to 
join the proposed countywide transportation agency until after the tollways are 
built because of problems involving the sale of revenue bonds to help 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, tollway officials recently charged that Stanley T. Oftelie, 
executive director of the Orange County Transportation Commission, is promoting 
criticism of the tollway agency as part of a bid to become the county's 
transportation "czar." 
</P>
<P>
There is no guarantee that he would be selected to head the agency that 
Bergeson's legislation would create, Oftelie said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that current recommendations by a consulting firm call for any new 
consolidated agency to have several operating divisions, each with its own 
chief similar to the head of a county department.

OZONE ISSUE EXPERT SAYS DON'T WAIT TO BAN CFCS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the two scientists who discovered the chemical depletion of the Earth's 
ozone shield while conducting research at UC Irvine in the 1970s on Friday 
praised President George Bush's call for a ban on the destructive compounds 
that cause the problem, but said action should not wait until the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Molina, now a researcher at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Canada 
Flintridge, sounded the first alarm in 1974 along with UCI chemistry professor 
F. Sherwood Rowland. Recently, Molina proved that chemical chlorofluorocarbons, 
known as CFCs, in the atmosphere are directly responsible for an irreparable 
hole in the ozone over Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely pleased that it (White House attention to the danger posed by 
CFCs) is happening," Molina said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we would like to see a complete ban imposed as soon as possible. 
The damage occurring to the ozone now is the result of CFCs released a decade 
ago, and the CFCs released today will damage the ozone for 100 years," he said. 
"The problem will get worse no matter what, so the sooner we act, the better." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Molina said, Bush's statement and increased world attention to 
the problem "is reassuring that one can make a difference; one just has to do 
it right." 
</P>
<P>
Molina, 42, was a postdoctoral researcher at UCI when he and Rowland discovered 
that CFCs, substances found in aerosol sprays, air-conditioning systems and 
cleaning solvents, caused chain reactions responsible for rapid destruction of 
the ozone. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland, who for many years was derided as a crackpot and a publicity hound by 
CFC manufacturers, was vindicated last month when he received the Japan Prize 
for his work. The award, which includes a $400,000 cash prize, is considered 
second in scientific prestige only to the Nobel Prize. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland was in London, where he is scheduled to address a United Kingdom 
Department of Environment Symposium on saving the ozone layer this weekend, and 
could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
However, at a reception in his honor after the prize announcement in February, 
Rowland, 62, said the recent discovery by Japan's biggest CFC manufacturer of a 
promising replacement compound could speed elimination of CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem on a global basis now has a life of its own," he said. "Solutions 
are being sought by many governments and the United Nations, and changes are 
being made. . . . The direction in which things are looking is (toward) a 
worldwide ban within 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
The ozone layer is a protective band of gas that blocks much of the sun's 
ultraviolet rays, protecting animals and plants. Rowland and Molina have 
predicted that depletion of the ozone would result in increased skin cancer 
rates and catastrophic climatic changes. Rowland's work to publicize the 
findings resulted in a 1978 congressional ban on the use of CFCs in aerosol 
sprays. 
</P>
<P>
In hindsight, Molina said, "Society should have started much sooner to look for 
replacements. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to move through a lot of hurdles to convince society in general that 
this was a problem. Looking at it most optimistically, things could have been a 
lot worse if we had not issued these initial warnings." 
</P>
<P>
UCI research associate Donald Blake, who is in charge of Rowland's atmospheric 
research group, said Friday that there is wide agreement among 
environmentalists that the 1987 Montreal Protocol, an international pact to cut 
CFC production in half, did not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no longer skepticism about this problem," Blake said. "It was 
discovery of ozone hole (above Antarctica) that really brought this to people's 
attention. There is recognition of the effect actions of our generation will 
have on many generations in the future."

GIRL LOSES PART OF ARM IN CRASH; YOUTH FACES CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

An early-morning car crash on Interstate 5 in Capistrano Beach left two 
teen-agers injured, including one who lost part of her arm, and another, the 
driver of the car, facing a possible felony hit-and-run charge, the California 
Highway Patrol reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Three teen-age boys, including the driver, fled from the accident, a CHP 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
University High Students 
</P>
<P>
Two girls who were left injured at the scene were identified as Sakura Austen 
and Claire Huckabay, both 14-year-old freshmen at University High School in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Huckabay's left arm had to be amputated at the elbow by paramedics who 
responded to the accident at 12:25 a.m. Friday, authorities said. Austen 
suffered a fractured collar bone and back injuries. Both were taken to Mission 
Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old driver of the vehicle, who officers said did not have a 
driver's license, and two of his high school friends, ran away after the Dodge 
sedan crashed into the center divider and rolled back onto the freeway, a CHP 
spokesman said. Their names were not released. 
</P>
<P>
Sakura Austen, interviewed at the hospital Friday evening, said she remembers 
the car "flipping over" and "I remember some man that pulled over and tried to 
pull Claire out. And then they tried to wake me up because I wouldn't get up." 
</P>
<P>
She said she was knocked unconscious and does not remember what happened to the 
three boys in the car. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Ken Daily said the car driven by the unlicensed 16-year-old was 
traveling about 70 m.p.h. when it went out of control and crashed. Daily said 
the three boys fled, leaving the girls in the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
The two girls, Daily said, may have been sitting in the back seat. They were 
not wearing seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
At 4 a.m., more than 3 hours after the accident, the three boys turned up at 
San Clemente Hospital, where police took them into custody. Daily said police 
would seek felony hit-and-run charges against the driver for leaving the scene 
of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
The two other boys were released to their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the boys apparently were students at University High School in Irvine 
and the third was a student at El Toro High School. 
</P>
<P>
The car was registered to the parents of one of the boys, CHP officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerard Austen, Sakura's father, said he and the other girl's parents were 
distraught when they learned of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"Last night, when I saw the mother and father of the other child, we cried on 
each other's shoulders, but I don't know if I cried for them or out of relief 
that it wasn't my daughter who lost part of her arm," Austen said. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem (behind the accident) is the irresponsibility of the children, the 
accessibility of getting cars, getting a license at the age of 16, well, I can 
go on and on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said that Sakura Austen was expected to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred just north of the junction of Pacific Coast Highway and 
the freeway.

NEWPORT BEACH MAY KEEP JET SKIERS AT A SAFE DISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER L. CHIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Teri Nelson goes swimming near Newport Pier, she doesn't want any jet 
skiers around. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just too dangerous," Nelson said, basking in the sun recently while her 
two children played in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, 33, who often swims near the pier during the summer, is all for a 
proposal drafted by Newport Beach officials to keep Jet Skis and motorized 
surfboards away from swimmers and surfers. 
</P>
<P>
But her sentiment isn't shared by Brent Barnes, 42, the owner of Costa 
Mesa-based Jet Sports. He said moving Jet Skis and motorized boards well beyond 
the breaking waves will take much of the excitement out of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"To be restricted out of the surf line wouldn't be too much fun," said Barnes, 
whose company sells motorized surfboards. "The thing is, once you become 
proficient at this thing, it becomes really dull to ride in flat water." 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, jet skiers would have to launch their craft from a 
designated area in Newport Harbor and stay 100 feet from bathers and 200 feet 
from any beach frequented by bathers, said Capt. Ron Johnson of Newport Beach's 
Marine Department. The rules would cover a 6 1/2-mile stretch from the Santa 
Ana River jetty to Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions, which require City Council approval, would apply between 10 
a.m. and 5 p.m. from May 1 through Sept. 30, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty for violating the rules has not been determined, said David 
Harshbarger, director of Newport Beach's Marine Department. 
</P>
<P>
The Parks, Beaches and Recreation Commission approved the regulation 2 weeks 
ago in response to a public outcry about Jet Skis, Johnson said. City officials 
said they aren't aware of any accidents involving Jet Skis in area waters. 
</P>
<P>
But, Johnson said, "there are complaints all the time by surfers, swimmers, 
bathers, boogie boarders and fishermen on the piers." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed restrictions are similar to those that keep surfers away from 
bathers in some Newport Beach waters during the summer, Johnson said. Seal 
Beach and Laguna Beach have similar restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach City Council will probably consider the issue this month, 
City Atty. Bob Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Dangerous' 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Evelyn R. Hart said she is "leaning toward limiting the Jet Skis. 
I think motor-powered vehicles are very dangerous. . . . We've even had 
accidents with surfboards, so you can imagine what it would be like with Jet 
Skis for swimmers." 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Martin, spokeswoman for Irvine-based Kawasaki Motors Corp. USA, as 
well as the International Jet Ski Boating Assn., said she plans to urge the 
council to consider a designated area near the beach for the motorized craft, 
"or at the very least, (permission to) launch from the beach to the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said that Daytona Beach, Fla., has such a designated area and the system 
has worked well. Newport Beach officials "are trying to keep an accident from 
happening, and we fully support that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Personal Watercraft 
</P>
<P>
Kawasaki Motors is the distributor of the Jet Ski. In the industry, the devices 
are referred to as "personal watercraft." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said the Personal Watercraft Industry Assn. estimates that about 150,000 
have been sold in the United States in the last 12 years. She said that about 
900 of her firm's vehicles are owned in Newport Beach, Corona del Mar and Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
T.K. Brimer, 40, a surfer who owns a Newport Beach surf shop, doesn't want to 
see any of them near the pounding waves. 
</P>
<P>
"The two sports don't interact well together," Brimer said. About 6 weeks ago, 
he said, he saw a surfer attack a jet skier because the latter had been riding 
too close to surfers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm amazed somebody has not been seriously hurt yet," Brimer said. "Somebody 
is going to be killed if nothing's done about it soon." 
</P>
<P>
And not all Jet Ski enthusiasts oppose the restrictions. Dennis O'Leary, 30, a 
jet skier, agrees that Jet Skis and surfboards don't mix. 
</P>
<P>
"I just stay away from the surfers," he said, adding that he does not ride at 
all during the summer. "Usually there's a lot of people, and if you lose your 
Jet Ski, you can kill somebody."

100 EVACUATE AREA OF TOXIC SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE BUNDY SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two 55-gallon drums filled with an ether-based substance fell from a truck in 
Irvine, forcing authorities to cordon off the intersection of Von Karmen and 
McGaw avenues and evacuate about 100 people from two businesses Friday morning, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said passers-by 
discovered the drums, which were leaking into a flood control channel, at about 
9:45 a.m. The drums fell from a truck from Anaheim-based Cypress Chemical Co., 
Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
Two hazardous-materials teams and a fire engine company were sent to the scene 
to determine the type of chemicals involved and to contain the spill in the 
business and light industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
Cha said the fact that the spill occurred in an open area when there were no 
winds helped firefighters quickly bring the situation under control. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials identified the ether-based substance as dipropylene glycol 
monomethyl ether, a chemical that is used as a solvent and in the manufacture 
of hydraulic brake fluids. It is moderately toxic and hazardous if absorbed 
through the skin or inhaled in large quantities, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials advised businesses to shut off air conditioners and close 
windows and doors to prevent fumes from entering buildings. No injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Workers were allowed to return to their buildings about 1 p.m. and the 
intersection was reopened about 4 p.m. GEORGE BUNDY SMITH

Three Anaheim detectives bagged a man Friday suspected of being the "Bagman 
Bandit" and believed responsible for more than 60 armed robberies of small 
shops in a dozen cities in Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said the suspect, whom they identified as Fernando Sanchez, 34, was 
arrested without incident at a La Habra motel. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the suspect got his name because he carried a revolver in a plastic 
bag so that his victims could see it. He carried another plastic bag for the 
money. Police said the bandit got between $200 and $300 in each of the 
robberies. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, who has no known permanent address, is suspected of committing the 
first of the 60 robberies Oct. 28 in Anaheim, hitting a fast-food restaurant, 
and the last one Tuesday in Anaheim. Police said he committed at least 60 
robberies of small businesses in the cities of Buena Park, Santa Ana, Orange, 
Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach, Garden Grove, Fullerton and Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured during the bandit's armed robberies, according to Barbara 
Burke, a spokeswoman for the Anaheim Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't violent. He would just ask them for the money," Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
The "Bagman Bandit" was so prolific that late last month, up to 19 police 
officers in Orange County cities conducted joint stakeouts of small shops such 
as ice cream parlors, hair stylists, fast-food restaurants, sandwich stores and 
several pharmacies in an unsuccessful effort to catch him. 
</P>
<P>
Burke described the suspect as Latino, 6 feet tall, with short wavy black hair, 
a mustache and a missing front tooth. She said officers recovered a pistol at 
the motel where Sanchez was arrested Friday. 
</P>
<P>
She said a series of tips from various county law enforcement agencies resulted 
in Sanchez's arrest. He was being held late Friday in County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Detectives Ron Good, Mike Patterson and Bob Brown made the 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez is expected to be arraigned Monday.

18 BANK HOLDUPS COULD BE CLEARED; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE ARREST 'NERD' ROBBERY SUSPECT

A man suspected of being a busy Orange County bank robber dubbed "the Nerd" 
because of his thick eye glasses was arrested Friday after FBI agents used 
information on a holdup note to track him to an Anaheim apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agent Bucky Cox said John Wade Oechsle, 22, was arrested without incident 
when agents used information they found inside an envelope on which the bank 
robber had written a note demanding money. 
</P>
<P>
Cox said the robber left the note with a teller at Gibraltar Savings on 
Orangethorpe Avenue in Fullerton after a holdup Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, a supervising agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Santa Ana 
office, said the information inside the envelope identified not Oechsle but his 
roommate. Once agents learned the address of the apartment complex, Oechsle's 
photograph was identified by other residents. 
</P>
<P>
Cox said that the suspect could be responsible for up to 18 holdups in Orange 
and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, FBI agents sought the public's help in identifying two 
robbers who were targeting Orange County banks and provided photographs that 
were published Tuesday in The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said at the time that the bespectacled robber called "the Nerd" 
typically approached a bank teller with a note or a verbal demand for cash. 
Once the teller had emptied the cash drawer, the robber then would walk away 
casually, without calling attention to himself. He always took relatively small 
amounts of cash, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Cox said he did not know how much money was taken in the Gibraltar holdup. No 
weapon was used and no one was hurt, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Oechsle is suspected of robbing banks in Westminster, La Habra, Orange, Tustin, 
Santa Ana, Anaheim, Garden Grove, Brea and Diamond Bar, authorities said.

75 EVACUATED IN CHEMICAL SPILL AT SURGERY CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seventy-five workers at Memorial Health Center in Huntington Beach were 
evacuated Friday afternoon after an employee spotted a leak of a hazardous 
chemical in a storage room on the first floor of the building. 
</P>
<P>
According to Huntington Beach fire officials, a total of 31 firefighters and 
Orange County Health Care Agency specialists helped in the cleanup effort 
Friday afternoon and evening. There were no injuries, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical was ethylene oxide, which is used to sterilize instruments for 
surgery. It is extremely flammable as well as being a health hazard, 
authorities said. It was kept in two 90-pound tanks in the storeroom. 
</P>
<P>
The center is an outpatient surgery center, the Huntington Beach Fire 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
The Westminster Fire Department also participated in the cleanup, fire 
officials said.

CANYON HOPES WHAT IT DOESN'T KNOW WON'T HURT AGAINST AGOURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
John Williams, girls' soccer coach at Canyon High School, said he doesn't know 
much about Agoura, which his team will face at 3 today in the Southern Section 
3-A soccer final at Gahr High School in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps ignorance is Williams' best defense. 
</P>
<P>
For those in the know, Agoura (25-0), the top-seeded team in 3-A, has been an 
unstoppable force, churning out some dazzling statistics. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Chargers have: 
</P>
<P>
 -- an unbeaten streak of 77 games, dating back to December, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 -- allowed only six goals in 25 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- scored 175 goals (a Southern Section record) this season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- the experience of winning the past three 2-A championships. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura reaps its riches from an area loaded with club soccer talent. According 
to Agoura Coach Dave Godwin, at least 10 of his players have been playing on 
club teams together since they were 8 or 9. 
</P>
<P>
Junior striker Heidi Walters leads Agoura's tremendous offensive output with 31 
goals, followed by senior Vanessa Martin (24), sophomore Sunday DiZazzo (23) 
and junior Jill Gallegos (19). Senior midfielder Julie Tingle (16 goals) also 
has a section-record career 102 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Lisa Ferragamo, a two-time All-Southern Section defensive player of 
the year, has contributed to Agoura's 19 shutouts. She is niece of former Ram 
quarterback Vince Ferragamo. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the Chargers are quick, athletic and highly skilled. What's an opponent 
to do? 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to play our own game," Williams said. "I know they're a 
talented ball-control team, but so are we." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the strategy's been working just fine for sixth-seeded Canyon (19-1-4). 
The Comanches' only loss this season was to Temple City, the 2-A's top-ranked 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, my ultimate goal wasn't ever to win the CIF title," Williams said. "It 
was just to get there. Of course, now that we're there, I'd love to win it. But 
whatever happens, we've had an incredible year." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, this has been a record-setting season for the Canyon girls' program, 
which, in its nine-year history, had never advanced past the second round of 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Canyon has set school records for most victories (19), most 
shutouts (14) and most single-season goals by an individual (22 by team captain 
Christa Ramirez). 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez has scored both goals in 1-0 victories over La Quinta (second round) 
and third-seeded Moreno Valley (quarterfinal). Tuesday, she scored twice in a 
4-1 semifinal victory over second-seeded Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, and Canyon's talented goalie Keri Erkenbrack, also star on the 
school's basketball team, which finished second in the 4-AA division Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Kim Maynard, Canyon's leading fullback, sprained her knee in Tuesday's 
semifinal and is not expected to play today. 
</P>
<P>
When told of Agoura's impressive statistics, Williams remained unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter to me," he said. "My girls have been confident all through 
the playoffs. We're confident now."

MISSION VIEJO WILL MEET SANTA BARBARA FOR 3-A TITLE

Mission Viejo High School is the only team of five seeded Orange County boys' 
soccer teams to advance to the finals of the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Diablos (22-1-3), the top-seeded team in the 3-A, meet unseeded Santa 
Barbara (21-1-6) in the 3-A championship at 8 tonight at Gahr High School in 
Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
The Diablos field a strong and unselfish offensive unit. Fifteen of the team's 
16 field players have scored at least once. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Joe-Max Moore leads the way with 24 goals and 10 assists, followed 
by Andy Wortrich with 13 goals and 15 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian, top-seeded in the Small Schools division; Brea-Olinda, 
top-seeded in the 2-A; Pacifica, third-seeded in the 2-A; and Santa Ana, third 
seeded in the 3-A, all have been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Though the seeded teams have been upset, unseeded teams, such as Edison, have 
take up the slack. The Chargers, the No. 1 team from the Sunset League, 
advanced to the final in the 4-A. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A, unseeded Esperanza (16-3-2), the top team from the Empire League, 
plays Central (21-1-1) for the championship tonight at Gahr at 6. 
</P>
<P>
Second-year Coach Kino Oaxaca's Aztecs are out to prove to the rest of the 
Empire League that they are a quality team. 
</P>
<P>
Despite winning the Empire League, the Aztecs were overlooked by the league 
coaches when it came time to select the all-Empire League soccer squad. The 
coaches selected only one Aztec, Darin Martinez.

CAPISTRANO VALLEY BREAKS AWAY TO TAKE TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the score tied and 2 minutes remaining in overtime, Capistrano Valley High 
School forward Becky Linhart did what no other player could manage Friday night 
at Gahr High School. 
</P>
<P>
She reached another peak in her already peaked performance. 
</P>
<P>
In what may have been the greatest breakaway of the season, Linhart dribbled 
past four defenders and slammed home the final goal that gave Capistrano Valley 
a 4-3 victory over Simi Valley in the Southern Section 4-A girls' soccer title 
match. 
</P>
<P>
"All I knew is that we had 2 minutes left and we had to do it," said Linhart, 
who also scored one goal in regulation. "It was either now or never." 
</P>
<P>
With the match quickly coming to a close, the reality of a co-championship -- 
awarded to teams which tie in a championship match -- drew near. 
</P>
<P>
To some, this might have seemed an appropriate outcome. After all, both teams 
played spectacular soccer, forcing each other to a higher level after each goal 
was scored. And one by one, players on both sides were dropping with injuries 
and drooping with fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I told the girls (before) overtime is we didn't come here for a 
tie," Cougar Coach Steve Bignal said. "They knew they could leave here 
champions." 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars responded with authority. Although Simi Valley had outshot 
Capistrano Valley, 18-9, during regulation, it was the Cougars who got their 
offense going when it got tough, outshooting Simi Valley, 8-4, in the 20-minute 
overtime period. 
</P>
<P>
Monica Larrson managed the first shot just 25 seconds into the period, 
rebounding less than a minute later with a dangerous breakaway attempt that was 
blocked by Simi Valley defenders. The Cougars closed in repeatedly, with 
Gretchen Fleischli firing a strong attempt from 30 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
Although Simi Valley goalkeeper Kim Duran caught Fleischli's shot, the Cougars 
did not let down. Seconds later, Larrson zipped downfield toward what appeared 
to be a clean breakaway goal in the making, but, just 10 yards before the goal, 
Larrson was tackled by a defender and no foul was called. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley began to respond, firing six consecutive shots on goal. But a 
moment later, Linhart made her scoring breakaway and the Cougars had the title. 
</P>
<P>
"We played such a good game," Simi Valley Coach Mark Johnson said. "Oh, it's 
hard to lose after playing so well." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley, which had upset three-time defending Mission Viejo and top-seeded 
Esperanza en route to Friday's championship match, played especially well in 
the first half. The Pioneers (24-3-2) kept the Cougars out of their favored 
precise-passing game. But Simi Valley's most dangerous weapon proved to be the 
throw-ins of senior halfback Stephanie Gainer, which led to goals -- one by 
Gina Skinner and a second by Kim Taketa, who tied the score, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Ginger Frank and Cindy Attaway scored the other goals for Capistrano Valley, 
which finished its season 22-4-1.

Heath Sims looked invincible and the teams from Canyon, Katella and Savanna 
high schools -- small though they might be -- appeared unstoppable during the 
preliminary rounds of the state wrestling championships Friday at University of 
the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge's Sims, last year's state champion at 132 pounds who has moved up to 
138 this season, pinned his first opponent, Tokay's Quoc Nguyen in 3 minutes 8 
seconds, then beat Clovis' Ralph Olivas, 8-3, and destroyed Jason Hendrick, 
15-1, in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
After that match, asked if he felt pushed much, Sims replied, "not really. But 
wait until tomorrow. Things really get tough then." 
</P>
<P>
Sims referred to today's semifinals and finals. Canyon, Katella and Savanna, 
who took only seven wrestlers among them, placed two wrestlers each in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
There was no surprise about Canyon's Zach Cooper making the semifinals; he's 
ranked No. 1 at his weight -- 191. But Cooper was trailing North Bakersfield's 
Kevin Langley, 8-6, midway through the third period of their quarterfinal 
match. Cooper tied the match on a takedown, and won it in overtime, 14-9. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's Southern Section rival, El Dorado's Brian Tomazic, didn't fare so 
well. Tomazic, who was second to Cooper at the 4-A championships and Masters 
meet, was beaten, 5-4, on a last second takedown by Brad Bell of Fresno Clovis 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon's Ravi Ramsamooj, who has been bothered by a shoulder injury all season, 
advanced through the 112-pound division without a close match. He defeated 
Valhalla's Pat Mack, 7-1, in the quarterfinals, and will take on favorite Tony 
Trujillo of Covina High in the today's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"Early in the season, because of my shoulder injury, I thought I'd never be 
able to wrestle again," Ramsamooj said. "Now I've got my chance against 
Trujillo. I think if I wrestle like I did today and cut down on little 
mistakes, I can get him." 
</P>
<P>
Trujillo has defeated Ramsamooj all four times they have met. 
</P>
<P>
Katella's Joe Pastorello had cruised into the 175-pound quarterfinals by 
beating his two opponents by a combined score of 19-3. But he found himself 
down, 2-1, with less than a minute to go in his match against Jim Keck of 
College Park. With 55 seconds left, Pastorello tied the score on an escape and 
with 12 seconds to go he scored a two-point takedown and won, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't worried," he said. "I was just waiting for that one shot in on him. I 
knew if I could get it, I could finish it off." 
</P>
<P>
Katella's Chris Mollkoy had a relatively easy road into the 154-pound 
semifinals, he won his first match with a pin, the second by four points, and 
beat Enterprise's Mavin Gordan, 9-5, in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna's Mike Verbeck had anything but an easy time at 132 pounds. Verbeck won 
his first two matches each by a point before defeating Mt. Diablo's Derek 
Miyake, 4-1, in the quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna's Tony Okada had an up and down day at the 126-pound division. After 
winning, 6-0, in the first round, Okada needed overtime to defeat Calavares' 
Greg Kirk. But he dominated San Martin's Ryan O'Leary in the quarterfinals, 
6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna placed two wrestlers in the semifinals for the first time, but didn't 
place among the top 10 after the first three rounds, Katella was 10th with 20 
1/2 points, Canyon was tied with Bullard for fourth with 24 1/2. No. 1-ranked 
and first-place Fresno Clovis West qualified five wrestlers for the meet and 
had 38 points. Ukiah was second with 25.

CHAPMAN STUNS DOMINGUEZ HILLS IN OVERTIME

<P>
Dean Balcao waited a long time between baskets, 36 minutes 44 seconds, to be 
exact. 
</P>
<P>
But, as far as the Chapman College basketball team was concerned, the wait was 
well worth it. 
</P>
<P>
Balcao dropped a 25-foot three-point field goal with 3 seconds left in 
regulation to give the Panthers a chance to extend their season. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't waste it. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman stunned Cal State Dominguez Hills, 67-62, in overtime in the semifinals 
of the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament Friday night at 
Riverside Community College. 
</P>
<P>
Balcao's jumper sent the game into overtime after the Panthers rallied from a 
nine-point deficit in 2:25 to tie the score, 59-59. Balcao also had a couple of 
steals in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman will play UC Riverside tonight at 8 for the conference's automatic 
berth in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division II playoffs. Riverside 
defeated Cal State Bakersfield, 73-68, in the second game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm speechless," Chapman Coach Rich Prospero said. "So don't expect any 
answers." 
</P>
<P>
With 2:25 left in regulation, Dominguez Hills (19-9) had a 55-46 lead. Most of 
the 1,129 in attendance were awaiting the second game of the doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
"It hit me, this could be the last 2 minutes of my career," Chapman senior 
forward Russ Ortega said. "I decided that, tired or not, I was going to bust a 
gut for those 2 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers (17-11) outscored the Toros, 21-7, from that point on. However, 
they needed a few breaks. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros missed three one-and-one opportunities in the final 2 minutes. They 
also had a slip-up on defense, as Michael Bell left Chapman's Mike Minier all 
alone for a three-pointer, which pulled the Panthers to within 59-56 with 19 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Dell'Amico had a chance to ice the game with 11 seconds left, but missed 
the first of a one-and-one. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega, who had 13 points and eight rebounds, grabbed the rebound and gave the 
ball to Balcao. Balcao fed Bryan Richetto, who dribbled the ball into the front 
court, were he was surrounded by three defenders. 
</P>
<P>
Richetto passed back to Balcao, who let fly from well behind the three-point 
line. The ball swished through with 3 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wanted Bryan to shoot it," said Balcao, who was the conference leader 
in three-point percentage. "That's why I gave it to him in the first place. I 
had made only one shot all night." 
</P>
<P>
Rog Middleton, who had 23 points, made four free throws in overtime, including 
two with 22 seconds left to give the Panthers a 65-59 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"For 38 minutes, Dominguez Hills did everything they had done to beat us twice 
during the season," Prospero said. "But they didn't make their free throws at 
the end."

L.A. VALLEY UPSETS NO. 1 FULLERTON, 70-69

Los Angeles Valley College defeated Fullerton, 70-69, Friday night in a 
semifinal game of the state community college women's basketball tournament at 
Los Angeles Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (27-2), which was ranked No. 1 in the state, had its winning streak 
stopped at 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we lost it in the first 8 minutes of the second half," Fullerton Coach 
Colleen Riley said. "We went cold." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's fortunes can best be demonstrated by the fortunes of its sophomore 
guard, Debbie Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Wagner hit five of six three-point shots to lead Fullerton 
to a 39-33 halftime advantage. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Wagner managed only a free throw and missed all five of her 
field goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's Kelli Johnson, the Orange Empire Conference player of the year, 
scored 14 second-half points to keep Fullerton in the game, but she received 
little support. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Valley, which got hot the same time Fullerton turned cold, scored the 
first eight points of the second half to take a 41-39 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Aguilar, who scored the first four points of the half on strong spin moves 
inside the key, scored 10 of her 14 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Valley's Christine Rumfola had a game-high 22 points, and Sandrine Rocher 
added 20. 
</P>
<P>
"We weathered the storm in the second half," L.A. Valley Coach Doug Michelson 
said. "We were satisfied to be down only by six at the half with how poorly we 
played." 
</P>
<P>
Although Lisa Crosskey's pair of free throws for Fullerton with no time left on 
the clock accounted for the final score, L.A. Valley had the game -- or at 
least a tie -- in hand with 32 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Shagarro Lattin's layup gave the Monarchs a three-point lead with 32 seconds 
remaining, and L.A. Valley's defense never allowed Fullerton to get off a good 
closing shot. Heidi Shikuma missed a hurried three-pointer and Crosskey was 
fouled on her three-point attempt. 
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal, American River College defeated the College of the 
Sequoias, 53-51.

NAIA DISTRICT 3 PLAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
SCC HOPES THIRD TIME DOESN'T BECOME A DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There are two schools of thought regarding Southern California College's 
chances of advancing to the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics 
basketball championships. 
</P>
<P>
And Vanguard Coach Bill Reynolds knows them both. 
</P>
<P>
Biola, Cal Baptist and Westmont -- the three other teams remaining in the NAIA 
District 3 playoffs -- are a combined 0-6 against Southern California College, 
each team losing twice. 
</P>
<P>
"You hate to play somebody you've already beaten twice," Reynolds said. 
"Conversely, if you've beaten a team twice, why not three times?" 
</P>
<P>
The logic is sound, but Cal Baptist might be hard to convince. 
</P>
<P>
The Vanguards, the district's top-seeded team, play the Lancers (20-10) in a 
semifinal game at 8 tonight at Whittier College. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Vanguards have beaten the Lancers by scores of 96-78 and 91-81, 
Southern California trailed at halftime both times. 
</P>
<P>
"The first game, we just fell apart in the second half," Cal Baptist Coach 
Jerry King said. "The second game was tied with 2 minutes left and they just 
beat us down the stretch. We're a much better team now." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers are fresh off an 81-75 victory Tuesday against Christian Heritage, 
which was the third-seeded team in the district. Cal Baptist led by as many as 
25 points in that game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad we don't have to play Westmont and Biola back-to-back, but I don't 
know if it makes a difference at this point," Reynolds said. "I mean, Cal 
Baptist has some really good athletes." 
</P>
<P>
Such as Michael Banks, a three-time all-district player. 
</P>
<P>
Banks averaged 18 points and seven rebounds per game this season and was a 
problem for the Vanguards in their two games. He is not only big (6-feet-5, 210 
pounds), but quick. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California uses only one player taller than 6-2, Todd Bickmore (6-7). 
</P>
<P>
"Todd just doesn't match up well with Banks at all," Reynolds said. "He tries, 
but he doesn't have the quickness." 
</P>
<P>
Cal Baptist also has its New Zealand connection in Warren Davis, Neil Swindale 
and Tony Smith, all former members of the New Zealand national team. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a 6-4 guard, averages 13 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
The Vanguards have five players who average in double figures, including 
Bickmore (team-high 20 points). 
</P>
<P>
Terry Scruggs (18 points), Todd Dixon (16), Kyle Lundy (15) and Phil Hills 
(nine) also start. Jim Mansfield (11) and John Mounce (eight) are the players 
Reynolds' uses off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"With SCC, you're not concerned about one or two guys, you have to be concerned 
with the whole team," King said. "The first time you see them, they don't look 
like much. They just don't look threatening. But they all shoot well and they 
all play hard defense and they work well together as a team. They're tough as 
nails." 
</P>
<P>
The winner faces Westmont or Biola in Tuesday's championship game at Whittier 
College. Westmont (18-12) and Biola (27-5) play in Saturday's 6 p.m. game at 
Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of Tuesday's championship game moves on to Kansas City for the 
32-team national tournament, March 14-20.

American Stores Co. reported earnings of $98.2 million for the year ended Jan. 
28, contrasted with earnings of $154.3 million for the prior year. Earnings for 
the fourth quarter were $20.2 million, contrasted with $46 million for the 
comparable period last year.American said its $2.5-billion purchase last year 
of the Lucky Stores supermarket chain hurt earnings because of interest expense 
resulting from the purchase and the amortization of the write-up of Lucky's 
assets. The company added that the decline was less than anticipated because 
Lucky's operating results are exceeding budgeted levels. American Stores Co.'s 
principal operating subsidiaries include Acme Markets Inc., Jewel Food Stores, 
Star Market Co., American Drug Stores Inc., Alpha Beta Co., Lucky Stores Inc. 
and American Food &amp; Drug Inc. The company, which has 1,917 retail food, 
drug and combination food and drugstores in 39 states, is in the process of 
relocating its headquarters from Irvine to Salt Lake City.

IRVINE'S T/I PHARMACEUTICALS USES 'LETHAL WEAPON II' TO BOOST TI-SCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Leslie Berkman, Times staff writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When moviegoers see "Lethal Weapon II" this summer, they may notice in one 
pool-side scene that actor Mel Gibson is rubbing a handful of TI-Screen on a 
woman's back. 
</P>
<P>
And if they are especially attentive, they may notice bottles of TI-Screen 
strategically dispersed among 150 extras milling about the pool and three beach 
bags advertising the product of T/I Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
But in case viewers missed the message, drugstores around the country will be 
running special promotions and the sun screen will sport a new slogan: "TI 
Screen, the lethal weapon against the sun." 
</P>
<P>
T/I Pharmaceuticals' marketing drive is being led by Lou Silverman, formerly 
vice president of major sales accounts for Revlon's fragrances and cosmetics. 
Silverman took over the job of general manager of T/I Pharmaceuticals in 
February of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Silverman declined to say how much he is paying Warner Bros. for the screen 
exposure. The movie promotion is only a portion of a $1.2-million advertising 
and marketing campaign that T/I Pharmaceuticals has budgeted for 1989. That 
compares to just $314,000 budgeted last year. 
</P>
<P>
The company also has begun to advertise its over-the-counter cold sore medicine 
and skin moisturizer on radio stations and cable television stations. 
</P>
<P>
Previously the company built a following for its products by relying almost 
entirely upon the recommendations of dermatologists. 
</P>
<P>
High-profile marketing already has proven its worth, Silverman said, noting 
that the company's sales more than doubled to $3.4 million in 1988 from $1.5 
million the year before. "This year we are shooting for $6 million," he said.

OXNARD FIRM TO BUY FRONTIER BANK FOR $8.5 MILLION IN CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura County banking firm reached agreement Friday to acquire Frontier 
National Bank in La Palma for more than $8.5 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition by Ventura County National Bancorp in Oxnard is subject to the 
approval of federal regulators and the shareholders of Frontier's parent firm, 
Frontier Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Frontier Bank will operate as a subsidiary of Ventura and 
continue with its current management plan of attracting business customers in 
north Orange County, said Charles M. Matter, Frontier's president and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase price is expected to give Frontier shareholders a return of about 
five times their original investment, Matter said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ventura executives recognize that this bank has done well in its 6-year 
existence in an area that has been overlooked," he said. "They're a business 
bank, and we are too. But they're much larger, and they have developed some 
services that we can provide our customers." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was particularly excited about using Ventura's automated accounts 
management system, which allows bank customers to gain access to their deposit 
and loan accounts from their own personal computers so they can review 
transactions, switch funds between accounts and even make investments. 
</P>
<P>
"As a small independent bank, we could never afford to offer such services," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Matter said Ventura plans to increase Frontier's size as it goes after more 
banking customers. Ventura also hopes to acquire banks elsewhere in Southern 
California, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Ventura acquired Conejo Valley National Bank in Thousand Oaks and 
merged it the following year into its primary subsidiary, Ventura County 
National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Frontier Group, which is 40% owned by its board of directors, ended 1988 with 
$69.5 million in assets and an annual net income of $480,000, Matter said. Two 
directors own 9% of the stock and a few other shareholders own 5% to 9% of the 
stock. Matter said he owns about 8%. 
</P>
<P>
With the acquisition, Ventura would become a banking company with $290 million 
in assets. Last year, it earned $2.1 million.

BROKERAGE SUBPOENAED IN PROBE OF ATTEMPTS TO SELL LINCOLN S &amp; L

<TEXT>
<P>
A Cincinnati brokerage has been subpoenaed by federal investigators looking 
into possible stock manipulation involving American Continental of Phoenix and 
its efforts to sell Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
But the head of Queen City Securities said the firm was not itself a target of 
a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into questionable trading of 
American Continental stock. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't done anything wrong. We are cooperating with the SEC in any way we 
can," said H. Garrett Frey, Queen City's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Although SEC representative Mary McCue would not confirm or deny that a probe 
is under way, the National Assn. of Securities Dealers has confirmed that both 
it and the SEC are investigating, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reviewing Trading 
</P>
<P>
"We are reviewing trading in the stock," said Enno Hobbing, an association vice 
president. His agency oversees the national over-the-counter securities market 
on which American Continental is traded. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental's common stock, which sold for more than $7 a share just 2 
weeks ago, has plummeted to nearly $3. The firm's preferred stock also has 
declined in price, selling at around $6.50 a share in recent trading after 
holding steady just weeks ago at more than $10. 
</P>
<P>
That drop has been blamed on persistent rumors that plans by the Arizona firm 
to sell Lincoln had run aground. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, American Continental said its agreement to sell the thrift 
to a Los Angeles investor group headed by veteran thrift executive Spencer 
Scott had expired. The firm said it would continue to negotiate with the Scott 
group while entertaining bids from other suitors. 
</P>
<P>
"We are certainly willing to work with Scott, but we will be looking very 
closely at other sale options as well," American Continental Chairman Charles 
H. Keating Jr. said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Separate Development 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles confirmed 
this week that Lincoln is involved in a criminal fraud investigation. A 
spokesman for the office declined to discuss the matter, however. It was not 
clear if that investigation was related to the SEC inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Frey said his firm is examining the spread and impact of stock market rumors 
about the Lincoln sale and the short selling of American Continental's stock. 
It also is examining whether investors and American Continental have been 
harmed as a result, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Short selling involves the sale of borrowed stock by speculators who believe 
that the price is headed down. If they are right, they will buy shares at a 
lower price to cover their short sales and profit from the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Kielty, American Continental's senior vice president and general 
counsel, said Friday that he was not aware of a short-selling investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Such a probe would not involve the company directly, Kielty said. "But we sure 
would be pleased if the SEC is looking into it," he said. "Short selling has a 
negative effect on our shareholders because the short sellers want to drive 
down the price of our stock, so they generate bad news. We think they are the 
source of some of the rumors and negative information" about American 
Continental." 
</P>
<P>
Queen Cities Securities said it learned of the investigation when it was 
subpoenaed in February. It was asked to provide information concerning its 
activities in American Continental stock. Queen City holds hundreds of 
thousands of shares of the stock for its clients. 
</P>
<P>
Queen City supplied the SEC with documents, but no company executives have been 
interviewed by the agency, Frey said. Also, association investigators have not 
contacted the firm, Frey added. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked the SEC if we were a target and they said no, " Frey said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Frey would not disclose their names, he said others subpoenaed are 
likely to be among brokerages throughout the United States that make a market 
in American Continental's stock.

The Gypsy fortuneteller relaxed on the sofa, looking decidedly unexotic, even 
with her long, white, lacquered fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
She curled against a pillow, chatting easily about the psychic trade, as if she 
was a peddler of ice cream. A pearl necklace hung loosely around her throat. 
Her piercing brown eyes were warm and comforting. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Adams most definitely is not the Transylvanian-accented crone of TV and 
movie legend. 
</P>
<P>
No incense-choked storefront shop. No heavy shawl drawn close around the 
shoulders. No low lights or flickering candles either. 
</P>
<P>
There was even a whiff of disinfectant in the tidy room, as if some compulsive 
hygienist had only moments before sprayed the place. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel (my powers are) my gift from God," said Adams, proprietress of Psychic 
Readings by Diane in Fullerton. "It just comes naturally, like the way you see 
or breathe. Most of the people I read for are hesitant at first, because they 
don't know about it. But once they come in and understand, there's no fear 
whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the unknown" that frightens them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
People are bothered by the unknown, no doubt. But one of the lingering 
mysteries to many in modern times remains these olive-skinned Gypsy women who 
purport to see the future. Her mother had the psychic gift too, Adams said, 
"and I know one of my daughters will get it. It has never really failed. My 
mother, grandmother, great-grandmother. It just carries on." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many Roma -- as Gypsies prefer to call themselves -- Adams is not at all 
reluctant to claim her heritage from this clannish group with its origins 
centuries ago in northern India. 
</P>
<P>
They are a people who have remained almost fervently aloof from the non-Gypsy 
-- or gadjo -- world around them, shunning publicity. Theirs is a history of 
persecution and moving on. And some traditions, such as secrecy, die hard. 
</P>
<P>
(One fortuneteller refused to allow a tape recorder in the room or to have her 
picture taken. "It takes away the energy level," she said. "It weakens the 
power.") 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't the past that concerned Adams recently as she led a visitor to 
her reading room past an oddly out-of-place pay telephone. It was the future -- 
specifically, my future. 
</P>
<P>
Nailed above the reading room's door was a horseshoe, a gift from a frequent 
client, Adams said. Then she laughed: "I'm not too superstitious." 
</P>
<P>
A picture of Jesus stared down from the wall. On a bureau stood a white candle 
from Germany carved with a likeness of John the Baptist. A statue of St. 
Nicholas flanked the candle. 
</P>
<P>
After seating me at a glass-topped table, Adams asked me to think hard of two 
wishes, cradling my palms in her hands. I was told to repeat the wishes aloud 
before she began. Curiously, they were never mentioned again. 
</P>
<P>
She read my palms, making a prediction, then pausing to hear my reactions to 
it. "What does that mean to you?" was a question she asked often, encouraging 
long and thoughtful replies. 
</P>
<P>
It is an entrancing experience, having one's life described by a stranger -- an 
exercise as seductive as looking at a photograph of one's self. At the very 
least, what a visitor buys here for $20 is an attentive listener and guilt-free 
self-absorption. 
</P>
<P>
And isn't that the function, at its heart, of analysts, psychiatrists and 
psychologists? Isn't it possible that what we have here is the poor man's 
analyst? Armed with skepticism, or informed superstition, is the 
fortuneteller's client really worse off, contrasted with analysis? 
</P>
<P>
In visits to four randomly selected county fortunetellers and in telephone 
conversations with several others, some as a declared journalist and others 
incognito, I found nothing particularly shady or suspicious -- nor anything 
more enlightening than what could be found in a fortune cookie. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a winning way. Keep it," said the cookie from a Chinese restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"You try to comfort people," said Diane Adams. 
</P>
<P>
Just as a jumble of cookie fortunes pulled from a hat might reveal some 
astonishingly precise and concrete perceptions about a person, so too will a 
half-hour interview -- especially if the interviewer is a lifelong student of 
human behavior, as most fortunetellers are. 
</P>
<P>
Studying human behavior is, after all, their job. Adams said she began as a 
small girl in her mother's fortunetelling shop. 
</P>
<P>
But the fortuneteller's advantage over a cookie, other than lack of calories, 
is not so much prophetic powers as personal contact with the visitor. How many 
people enjoy the undivided attention of another sympathetic person for up to an 
hour? To a skeptic, that seems to be the psychic's most tangible service. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like getting motherly advice without your mother," one psychic's client 
confided in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
So long as a visitor knows not to leave a bag of money behind to be exorcised 
of any curse -- an old scam of unscrupulous fortunetellers -- a little 
introspection seems the only consequence. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, some people are fakes," Adams admitted. "And there's good psychics and 
bad psychics, just like any business." 
</P>
<P>
But as to comparisons of her "powers" with psychoanalysis or therapy, she just 
smiled. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the county's emerging cultural diversity, Adams' year-old shop 
in Fullerton shares a one-story office building with Tseng's Acupuncture Total 
Health Center. 
</P>
<P>
Like many fortunetellers in recent years, she is a relative newcomer to the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, fortunetelling has probably existed here since the first Europeans 
arrived, but for many years much of it was illegal. Some sweeping local 
ordinances even prohibited foretelling the future, even at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles lawyer Barry A. Fisher argued in a landmark 1985 case before 
the California Supreme Court that such bans were unconstitutional violations of 
freedom of speech and religion. 
</P>
<P>
Many fortunetelling laws were so broad that they could be construed to include 
Bible readings, newspaper horoscopes and even weather forecasts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher, who frequently represents Gypsies and fortunetellers, prevailed. The 
court's ruling ended longstanding bans on fortunetelling in many California 
cities. Among those whose bans were struck down were Laguna Beach, Fullerton, 
Brea, Yorba Linda, Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at Nancy Reagan," said Fisher, recalling the court ruling. "She is not 
alone. Astrologers, palmists in touch with the spiritual world, it all goes 
back to the beginning of time. 
</P>
<P>
"In a more sophisticated sense, people consult their religious leaders -- 
prophets living and deceased. People go to church and try to live their lives 
based on prophecy. It gets to the heart of what church and religion are about." 
</P>
<P>
Even people who go to fortunetellers simply for the entertainment value, Fisher 
added, are exercising their First Amendment rights to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take a clairvoyant to predict that business in the spirits would pick 
up after the court ruling, even as some cities redrafted their laws to require 
permits and even photographs and fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
"I think cities recognize today that you can't prohibit the activity," Fisher 
said. "They are licensing the activities in increasing numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Fisher's client in the 1985 Supreme Court case out of Azusa, Fatima 
Stevens, has since resettled in Anaheim. She advertises herself as "The World 
Famous Mrs. Stevens" in the telephone directory. Apparently preferring a less 
famous media profile these days, Stevens declined an interview. 
</P>
<P>
In some areas of the county, the clairvoyance competition is heating up and 
even turning nasty. A Gypsy family moved into Newport Beach from Texas 2 years 
ago and created quite a stir in the already-entrenched Romany circle working 
the waterfront spiritual trade. Rebuffed, the newcomers complained in a civil 
suit of harassment and threats to their shops. The case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
The financial stakes in crystals and Tarot cards can be high. A north county 
seer motors around in a new Cadillac with a cellular telephone and a vanity 
license plate that reads PALMRDR. 
</P>
<P>
One Anaheim psychic advertises a shuttle bus service to her parlor from 
Disneyland and convention-area motels. 
</P>
<P>
None of the fortunetellers interviewed for this story, however, were willing to 
disclose their incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Adams of Seal Beach Psychic -- who is not related to Diane Adams of 
Fullerton -- shook her head no when asked if her work pays for her stylishly 
decorated shop with its crystals and huge ceramic palm in the display window. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband is in real estate," she said with a broad grin. "This is part-time 
work." 
</P>
<P>
(There seemed something supernatural in the name coincidence. The mystery only 
deepened when both women -- who do not resemble each other -- also said they 
prefer to go by the first name of Ann. But secular curiosity got this visitor 
no closer to an explanation.) 
</P>
<P>
Based on an unscientific Times survey, it appears that most psychics charge 
similar rates for similar services. The cost increases depending on how far 
backward or forward one wishes to look. 
</P>
<P>
No one hesitated to quote a price over the telephone. In fact, fortunetellers 
prefer that clients call ahead to make an appointment. 
</P>
<P>
As things can be with the ethereal world, it is best to be flexible in trying 
to schedule an appointment. One clairvoyant could not be reached for a week, 
her husband said, because she was meditating to restore her powers. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, a typical palm reading runs about $20 in the county. With that, one 
buys a look at what's supposed to happen in the coming months, sometimes up to 
a year. Palmistry would appear to be based on fairly concrete rules of reading. 
Life, fate and prosperity lines are set in the flesh. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the four fortunetellers I visited told me to expect two children, that 
I would live into my 80s and that I would be prosperous and marry twice. That 
latter detail was a little distressing to my first and only wife. Even though 
any insurance actuarial chart has about the same expectations for anyone my 
age, she plans to have her own reading. Alone. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, one can buy any of dozens of books on palmistry to try at home. The 
illustrated pages make it all seem easy, but in fact it's a lot like reading an 
automotive repair manual to fix a carburetor: The pictures and text are all 
there, but somehow the pieces don't fit back together. Without the mechanic 
present, one never knows what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Prices escalate when cards, crystals and tea leaves are called upon to reveal 
their secrets. Tarot card readings cost $30 to $45. Psychometry or psychic 
readings go for $35 to $60 (here the seer holds a frequently handled item such 
as keys or a watch, things that supposedly radiate the client's energy). 
</P>
<P>
Crystal balls, those ubiquitous glass orbs that Hollywood favors, are generally 
the most expensive readings. They can cost $150 and more, telling the visitor 
of things to come 10 years away. Crystal balls also reveal stories of other 
people in one's life, or so the psychics claim. 
</P>
<P>
"If a person wants to know a lot of things, a palm or psychic reading is not 
enough," said the Seal Beach Adams. "Most people who come in know what reading 
they want. Most come for the crystal ball. They like to know a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunetellers also follow certain unwritten rules. For example, they generally 
ask before a reading whether a client wants to hear bad news too. 
</P>
<P>
"But most people say don't hide anything," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, they never tell their own fortunes, "because when you're psychic, you're 
supposed to use it for others," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And they do not pick the daily double -- at least not for customers.

FAMILY LIFE: WOMEN WHO REGRET THEIR ABORTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As she regained consciousness, Carmen heard the reassuring words of the 
recovery room nurse: "It's all taken care of. Everything's going to be fine." 
</P>
<P>
At first, she found those words comforting. Then she remembered where she was, 
and why. The 32-year-old mother of two was in a local hospital, and she had 
just had an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Across the hall were mothers with their new babies. Lying there in her hospital 
bed, drifting in and out of sleep, Carmen wished -- too late -- that she could 
be one of them instead. 
</P>
<P>
That was in December, 1976. Today Carmen, now 46, still grieves over what she 
calls "the most horrible experience of my life." In the intervening years, she 
has been hospitalized three times for severe depression, a condition she 
believes was triggered by the abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"For some people that might have a predisposition to depression, I really 
believe something like this can bring it on," she says. "And depression does 
run in my family." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the debate over abortion centers on whether a woman should have the 
right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. Although Carmen did have that 
right under the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling, she says the 
decision to abort was not hers. And that is the greatest source of her pain, 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
"I was forced into it," she says. "My husband didn't want the baby. My parents 
didn't want it either. Their pressure made me do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in a family where I was the good little girl who always did what 
Mother and Dad wanted me to do. I didn't have any control over it." 
</P>
<P>
Based on her experience, Carmen now believes that abortion should be illegal in 
most cases "because it can cause unpredictable future mental anguish." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the women who wrote to Family Life about their abortions said the 
decision was difficult and painful. All but Carmen, however, insisted that for 
them, abortion was the right thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
Carmen was joined by two other women who are opposed to abortion, neither of 
whom has had the experience herself. Otherwise, our response overwhelmingly 
favored women having the right to choose whether to terminate pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, we heard the majority. Now it's the dissenters' turn. 
</P>
<P>
Carmen was happily married, financially secure, with two young daughters back 
in 1976. After noticing that her blood pressure had climbed above normal, her 
doctor had taken her off the pill. A few months later, she found that she was 
pregnant again. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very happy about it," she says, but her husband wasn't. "When I told 
him, his reaction was, 'Oh, no!' He felt he just couldn't handle it." 
</P>
<P>
As they did with most decisions, the couple talked the question over with 
Carmen's parents. "They felt we were too old to have another child," she says. 
"I wasn't able to argue. There was just so much pressure." 
</P>
<P>
They even told the girls, ages 4 and 10, that their mother was expecting a 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we were trying to see what their reaction would be," Carmen says. 
"They were pretty excited about it, I think. I'm not sure; I have trouble 
remembering some things." 
</P>
<P>
Before she agreed to go through with the abortion, Carmen recalls, "I cried for 
8 days straight, without stopping except to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
But finally, in her 11th week, she went along with the family's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Carmen says: "I just felt there was life there. No matter how small it 
is, there was." 
</P>
<P>
After Carmen came home from the hospital, she and her husband told their 
daughters that there would not be a new baby after all. "We just said there 
wouldn't be room for another baby, and they'd like it better if they could have 
their own rooms," Carmen says. 
</P>
<P>
"They were little, and they didn't really understand, so they agreed with that. 
My older daughter is very angry with me about it now, however." 
</P>
<P>
Carmen says she told her husband afterward that she regretted the abortion, 
"but every time I brought it up, he just said, 'We did the best thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
After a while, she stopped mentioning it. 
</P>
<P>
About a year after the abortion, Carmen stopped eating and began losing weight, 
dropping from 140 pounds to 109. Her doctor hospitalized her for tests and 
later prescribed an antidepressant. 
</P>
<P>
Two other hospitalizations followed, under supervision of a psychiatrist. 
Carmen says she still sees the psychiatrist once a week and a psychologist two 
times a week, as well as other doctors for other physical problems. And she is 
on lithium, a drug used to regulate depression. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten past a lot of it now," she says. "A lot of time has gone by, and 
time heals." 
</P>
<P>
Carmen says she never discussed her feelings about the abortion with her 
parents, both of whom have died: "I couldn't talk to them about it. I was 
always afraid of them." 
</P>
<P>
Nor does she talk about it with her husband, although she says he "finally 
guessed that the abortion was what brought on my problems." They separated from 
1983 to 1987 but have since reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
The subject does come up during psychotherapy, Carmen says, and that helps: 
"I'm able to release a lot of the anger I have that way. I also talk to myself, 
but not loud enough for him to hear." 
</P>
<P>
Carmen calls abortion "murder" and says she believes it should be outlawed, 
except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is threatened. "For 
teen-agers, I'm 50-50 on that," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many people out there who want to adopt children. I think if a 
girl is 17 or older, she could be a parent or give it up for adoption. Younger 
than that, it's probably OK (to have an abortion). Or if the mother and father 
already have five children, they ought to eliminate the sixth. There has to be 
a limit to everything. 
</P>
<P>
"But a case like mine, where a woman is married and has the means to take care 
of the child, that's just ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Wendy, who lives in Costa Mesa, is 40 and about to give birth to her fifth 
child. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I am in the 'risky' age bracket for bearing children, I would 
never in this world think about having an abortion," she says. "I didn't even 
have an amniocentesis, because even if it was found that there was something 
wrong with the baby, I would never abort it. I believe that life begins at 
conception, and the medical-science community has sufficient information to 
support this belief. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the women's liberation movement has done much harm to women in 
general in convincing them that their bodies are more important than their 
babies' bodies. In the last 20 years, we have promoted sex education in the 
form of birth control, and now abortion has become a popular form of birth 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, this thinking has led to increased sexual promiscuity and the 
thinking that, 'Well, if I get pregnant, I'll just get an abortion.' 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's time we ended the 'me' generation and started reaching out to 
those in need. If everyone did a little to help, there would be no reason to 
kill unwanted babies, just because they're inconvenient." 
</P>
<P>
And Jeanne, who lives in Irvine, sent a postcard to say that "I cannot see that 
abortion will solve any of the problems of an 'unwanted' pregnancy. It will 
only intensify further problems in this life." 
</P>
<P>
Next week, we'll hear from a woman who made the heartbreaking decision to abort 
for medical reasons.

Since 1987, California licensed drivers 55 and older have been entitled to auto 
insurance premium discounts on liability, medical and collision coverage if 
every 3 years they take a state-approved course designed to improve driving 
skills and promote road safety. Although discounts depend on a driver's record 
and insurance carrier, the law applies to all California automobile insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
The improvement course is available at private driving schools, public and 
private colleges and offered by nonprofit organizations at community-based 
locations. The cost is usually $8. The Department of Motor Vehicles will issue 
certificates to those who complete the course. The certificate must be 
submitted to an insurance carrier for discount benefit.

The chief executive of American Baptist Churches says mainline Protestantism is 
suffering from an "ecclesiastical malaise" that "touches almost every point in 
our denominational and ecumenical life." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Daniel Weis, in in a sermon at New York's Riverside Church, compared 
mainline Protestantism to the Prophet Ezekiel's vision of a "valley of dead, 
dry bones." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said "these bones can live" through "our transformation as a people 
revitalized by the spirit."
