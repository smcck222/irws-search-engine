HENRY FAIRLIE; POLITICAL WRITER, AUTHOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Henry Fairlie, 66, a writer and contributing editor of the New Republic. 
Fairlie worked as a feature writer for the Observer newspaper in his native 
London and later was an editorial writer for the Times of London. 
</P>
<P>
He had been a free-lance writer since 1954, writing for the New York Times, 
Harper's, the Atlantic, the Washington Post and other publications. He also was 
the author of books on political affairs, including "The Spoiled Child of the 
Western World," "The Kennedy Promise," and "The Seven Deadly Sins Today." 
Fairlie considered the political reputation of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) 
greater than the senator deserved, and his writing on that subject prompted 
outraged letters to the New Republic. Fairlie devoted his last published column 
to the discovery of contamination in Perrier water. He urged his readers to 
drink Scotch whiskey, "made from nutritious whole grains," and pronounced: "No 
Scotch has ever been found to be contaminated." On Feb. 25 in Washington after 
a stroke.

BEN HILL GRIFFIN; FLORIDA CITRUS BARON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Florida citrus baron Ben Hill Griffin, 79, listed in Forbes magazine as one of 
the 400 richest Americans. In October, Forbes put him 261st on the list of 
wealthy Americans and said he was worth $390 million.

Griffin, a member of the Florida Legislature for 12 years, started his citrus 
empire in 1933, when his father gave him 10 acres of groves as a wedding 
present. His company, Ben Hill Griffin Inc., owned more than 10,000 acres of 
citrus groves and 85,000 acres of ranch and timberland in central Florida. The 
Griffin family sold its packinghouses and a huge juice processing plant to 
Procter &amp; Gamble Co. in 1981, which introduced its juice under the Citrus 
Hill brand name. On Thursday in Avon Park, Fla.

GABRIEL KATZKA; EMMY-WINNING PRODUCER, 59 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gabriel Katzka, a theater, film and TV producer known worldwide for his ability 
to raise money for entertainment projects, has died of a heart attack at his 
Upper East Side home in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Katzka was 59 when he died Feb. 19, his sister, Benji K. Green of Woodland 
Hills, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
From "An Evening With Nichols and May" on Broadway to his recent Emmy-winning 
television miniseries, "Ellis Island," Katzka's projects represented a wide 
cross-section of entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
His theatrical presentations included Richard Burton as "Hamlet," Liv Ullmann 
as "Anna Christie" and the "Comedians," directed by Mike Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
He also was co-producer of "Barefoot in the Park," "Things That Go Bump in the 
Night" and "Hughie." 
</P>
<P>
Katzka's films included "The Taking of Pelham One, Two, Three," "Marlowe," 
"Soldier Blue," "Who'll Stop the Rain," "Butch and Sundance: The Early Days," 
"The Beast Within," "The Lords of Discipline" and "The Falcon and the Snowman." 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Times series of articles in 1978 told how Katzka used his 
professional contacts and friends to help finance the film "Meteor," which 
starred Sean Connery, Natalie Wood and Henry Fonda in a disaster drama. 
</P>
<P>
He was described at that time as "a wizard in raising money for and production 
of Broadway shows and motion pictures." 
</P>
<P>
Katzka came by his ability naturally, for his father had been a trial lawyer 
who invested regularly in Broadway productions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his sister, he is survived by his wife, Carol, and a son. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service is scheduled March 11 at the Beverly Wilshire at 1 p.m.

HEADS SCRATCHING OVER HUNTER'S CHANGEABLE VIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stepping up to the microphone during a recent legislative debate, rookie 
Assemblywoman Tricia Hunter (R-Bonita) disclosed that she keeps a gun on her 
nightstand when her husband is away from home. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband happens to be in the Navy and I was chased off the road by 
somebody, who for some reason decided that I was going to be the target," 
Hunter said, referring to a 1983 incident in San Diego. "Fortunately, for me, I 
had friends available that did provide a gun that I now keep in the house and 
in my bedroom and at my bedside." 
</P>
<P>
The admission -- along with her vote that day against the latest 
handgun-control measure -- has some people wondering whether the 
nurse-turned-politician is backing away from the positions that catapulted her 
into national headlines and victory in a hotly contested election last year for 
the 76th District Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter last year was the only pro-choice Republican in a legislative race that 
was the first in the country to be decided after the U.S. Supreme Court's 
Webster decision, a July ruling that gave state Legislatures more say in the 
politically explosive abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
That legal opinion elevated what might have been a long-shot candidacy into a 
political litmus test on abortion. It galvanized the support of pro-choice 
advocates, who came out in droves to help her squeeze a victory last October in 
a solidly conservative district. Hunter's endorsement of an assault-weapons ban 
enacted earlier by the Legislature also drew support from the gun-control 
lobby. 
</P>
<P>
But just five months later, incumbent Hunter, 37, is downplaying the 
significance of her pro-choice position, in the race and in her day-to-day 
activities as state legislator. 
</P>
<P>
And her vote last month against a 15-day waiting period for hunting rifles and 
long gun sales -- a measure that narrowly passed the Legislature -- has some 
people grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
"When she came out against assault weapons, we supported her, and here we 
thought that we had someone very much on our side," said Stan Foster, a San 
Diego businessman and national vice chairman of Handgun Control Inc., who 
characterized Hunter's vote as a "terrible disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
"Not only did she vote against us, but she spoke against us on the floor of the 
Assembly on a critical issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics say Hunter is simply posturing to curry favor with her 
conservative constituents in time for the June primary, where a handful of 
Republican hopefuls believe they can turn the abortion issue around and knock 
her off. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what you're going to see from Tricia Hunter is that she is going to 
vote whatever is expedient," said Poway management consultant Dick Lyles, who 
lost twice to Hunter last year. "It's real clear what she's trying to do is 
appear to be a mainstream Republican." 
</P>
<P>
But the feisty political newcomer says her votes and tactics in Sacramento 
should come as no surprise. Hunter maintains that she's always been more 
conservative than portrayed by the media or campaign rhetoric, which focused on 
abortion and gun control. 
</P>
<P>
Most of her time in office so far, she says, has been used to feel her way 
through the often mysterious legislative process and to show her colleagues -- 
especially her fellow Republicans in the Assembly -- that as a former political 
outsider, she's willing to play on the team. While some of the most ardent 
anti-abortion Republicans still resent her, Hunter said she's been willing to 
win over such key people as Assembly Minority Leader Ross Johnson 
(R-Fullteron), who supported Lyles in the special election primary last year. 
</P>
<P>
She is also mindful of cultivating the Republican heavyweights back home as 
well. She took a two-day break and flew back to San Diego last week to meet 
Vice President Dan Quayle, as well as mingle with the party faithful at a 
fund-raiser featuring former President Ronald Reagan and U.S. Senator Pete 
Wilson. In her district, she's won over Poway City Councilwoman Linda Brannon, 
a special election opponent who is now co-chair of Hunter's reelection 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have gone to Sacramento with a chip on my shoulder," she said on the 
return trip to Sacramento. "I had a right to be indignant, angry at the way I 
was treated (by Republicans) in the election. But what purpose does it serve? 
It doesn't do me any good. 
</P>
<P>
"If you maintain the negative that came out of my race, you'll be ineffective. 
You have to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. And I don't plan 
to be ineffective. I've never been ineffective in my life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
By most Sacramento standards, however, that effectiveness still seems a way 
off. In a place where power and prestige is measured by the square footage of a 
legislator's Capitol office, Hunter's position in the pecking order is made 
abundantly clear by her cramped working quarters and its doorway between the 
elevators and stairwell. 
</P>
<P>
Her committee assignments are so unimpressive that she's had only one meeting 
in two months. Her small staff has been has written only a handful of bills. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Hunter toils away by arranging meetings with constituents, lobbyists and 
fellow lawmakers. Her big ambition: to land an assignment on the Assembly's 
Health Committee, where she wants to exploit her expertise as a hospital 
administrator and surgical scrub nurse. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be a very lonely place and tends to be a very lonely place because you 
don't know who you can call a friend," Hunter said of the Capitol. "You have to 
be very cautious." 
</P>
<P>
And cautious she's been, especially when it comes to the subject that many 
political pundits credit for her election in the first place -- abortion. 
Hunter showed her pro-choice leanings when she broke with Assembly Republicans 
and voted for a bill in January to restore $20 million to the state's family 
planning budget -- the biggest birth control test to emerge so far. 
</P>
<P>
But she's also making moves to distance herself from the emotional issue. She 
says her polls show that it was her position on the assault weapons ban -- and 
not abortion -- that won her the special election. And while she will continue 
to be pro-choice, she views it as only a "very minor vote" because 
abortion-related issues come up so infrequently in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not my only issue," she said. "I don't want to go to rallies and I don't 
intend to be a flag-carrying (advocate)." 
</P>
<P>
To prove the point, she turned down an invitation to appear with a long list of 
other lawmakers at a pro-choice rally outside the Capitol in January to mark 
the anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion. She was 
absent, although her victory in the special election was invoked by Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) as an example of the political muscle 
flexed by pro-choice forces. 
</P>
<P>
She has also voted against the pro-choice lobby. During the November special 
session on earthquake relief, she joined Assembly Republicans to block a 
resolution that simply called on Gov. George Deukmejian to restore the family 
planning funds. She voted against the measure, she said at the time, because it 
was a surprise and was out of place in the special session. 
</P>
<P>
In a milder test, Hunter last week abstained from voting on anti-abortion 
amendments that were proposed for a bill regarding genetic testing. The 
amendments failed. 
</P>
<P>
"She abstained against us on that bill, which was disappointing," said Norma K. 
Clevenger, lobbyist for Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California. "But I 
think probably because the amendments came up quickly, nobody had the time to 
talk to her." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Clevenger and other pro-choice supporters -- some of whom have adopted a 
wait-and-see attitude about Hunter -- say they believe the Bonita Republican 
will hang in during the big fights. Some of the mixed signals, they say, may be 
attributable to her worries about being reelected. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she sees herself as being somewhat vulnerable," said Clevenger. 
</P>
<P>
Some local Republicans believe Hunter will be vulnerable in this year's 
traditional primary race because it does not allow for a crossover vote from 
pro-choice Democrats, who rallied to Hunter's side last fall. Without those 
crossover votes, they contend, Hunter would not have been able to eke out a 
197-vote victory over Lyles in the special election primary and fend off an 
unusually strong write-in campaign by him in the Oct. 3 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Three Republican challengers have taken out papers to run against Hunter. They 
are Sue Reeves, a Poway resident who serves on the Pomerado Hospital board of 
directors; L. Ned Kohler, a senior vice president for Great American First 
Savings Bank, and Connie Younkin, an anti-abortion activist who recently served 
40 days in jail for demonstrating outside of a medical clinic. 
</P>
<P>
The trio is now holding meetings to decide who will emerge as Hunter's primary 
opponent, said Barry Jantz, a San Diego political consultant who serves as 
treasurer of the county's Republican Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"If one of these candidates gets in and wants me to be involved in the 
campaign, I will definitely be involved in the campaign against her," Jantz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's supporters, however, argue that her views are well-matched to her 
district and that abortion will not be a major stumbling block. She has taken 
care to tend to the anti-crime sentiments of the district by reviving a bill, 
sponsored by her predecessor, the late Bill Bradley of San Marcos, to guarantee 
the death penalty for anyone convicted of killing a child. 
</P>
<P>
The Assemblywoman also says that there is no erosion in her political finances, 
the overwhelming amount of which came from nurses around the state. 
</P>
<P>
Those interested in gun control, meanwhile, note that Hunter was strongly 
opposed by the National Rifle Assn. last year because of her endorsement of the 
assault-weapons ban. 
</P>
<P>
While Hunter maintains that it was her endorsement of the assault-weapons ban 
that won her the race, she added that she's made her opposition to the 15-day 
waiting period no secret. She is touting, instead, a computer system that can 
make instantaneous background checks on a prospective gun buyer. And then 
there's the fact that she has owned a .22-caliber handgun ever since the night 
somebody tried to run her off the road on Interstate 5, near Palm Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
She mentioned the incident in only her second speech ever on the Assembly 
floor, a disclosure that surprised some colleagues, who had her figured for a 
blanket gun-control supporter. 
</P>
<P>
"There was dead silence," she said. "That was a little intimidating."

NEW HOUSING HELPS OCEANSIDE FORGET ITS SEEDY PAST; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: AS CONDOS GO UP, CRIME IN A BEACHFRONT NEIGHBORHOOD GOES DOWN, 
OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget how the Beach Boys or the Mamas and the Papas extolled California beach 
life. 
</P>
<P>
All the experience meant to Leanne Cressman was a stabbing on her front porch, 
peeping Toms, dope deals and legions of prostitutes (the most attractive ones 
being transvestites, she insists). 
</P>
<P>
The beachfront neighborhood in Oceanside where Cressman has lived for six years 
was so warped that she and her fiance, Sean McDaniel, stocked few women's 
bathing suits when he opened a surf shop nearby last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't think anybody lived around here except hookers and drug dealers," 
said Cressman, 32. "We didn't think there were any women here." 
</P>
<P>
Unflattering stories about the community's unseemly past have lingered like a 
chronic cough yet, almost suddenly it seems, Oceanside's once grungy and 
crime-ridden coastal neighborhoods have begun to thrive. 
</P>
<P>
After almost 20 years of decline, absentee landlords are selling dilapidated 
rental homes to permanent residents who are upgrading the sagging old 
dwellings. And, most visibly, stylish condominium projects are turning the area 
partly into an enclave of vacation homes and tourist rental units. 
</P>
<P>
Property along most of the state's southern coastline is expensive and already 
built up. So for the past two years, increasing numbers of buyers have been 
taking a chance on Oceanside. And native residents are taking back their own 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
The courage to revive the ailing coastal neighborhoods was largely inspired by 
two events. The city rebuilt its crumbling pier a few years ago. And a key 
developer, with his partners, built the San Miguel condominium project, 
rekindling enthusiasm for Oceanside's beach area. 
</P>
<P>
Even Cressman, who said she was "scared to death" the first time she saw 
Oceanside and would not take walks outside after dark, strolls to the pier at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, this is just a little paradise," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her glee, Cressman acknowledged there are occasional problems near her 
fiance's surf shop, the South Jetty, a few blocks from the beach. She said they 
have been threatened, "stupid things, people wanting to break into our shop or 
break our windows." 
</P>
<P>
Cressman lives in North Strand, one of six neighborhoods between the 
picturesque Oceanside Marina to the north and the upscale St. Malo residential 
area to the south. The neighborhoods, all within the city's redevelopment area, 
are a few blocks west of the downtown and the railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
This coastal part of the redevelopment area makes up 1 1/4 miles of the city's 
four-mile coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the neighborhoods, such as South Pacific Street, have remained stable 
and relatively unscathed by crime and blight just a block or two away. But 
problems have caused the entire area to be stereotyped as a danger zone. 
</P>
<P>
The area declined in the late 1960s and early '70s, when downtown became rife 
with sex arcades, bars with topless shows and other attractions largely 
catering to young Marines. 
</P>
<P>
Many Marines returned from Vietnam and left the service but remained in 
Oceanside, their last duty station. Some were adrift and jobless, easy prey for 
the prostitutes and drug vendors who took root in cheap rental houses and 
apartments near the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some of the slimiest slime in Oceanside," recalled Pat Hightman, 
assistant director of the city redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
"You take your sexual orientation, and you could find it in Oceanside. It was 
so bad, Hollywood's vice squad came here to train." 
</P>
<P>
In the '70s, erosion turned stretches of beach into virtual cobblestone, 
removing the last incentive for people to visit much of Oceanside's coast. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the city closed the strip joints, adult bookstores and pornography 
theaters, while police beefed up patrols in the coastal neighborhoods. Crime 
tapered off, according to police and redevelopment officials, but the area 
remained run-down. 
</P>
<P>
That's about the time developer Rich Cicoletti came along. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach native first visited Oceanside in 1966 and found it "a raucous 
military town with a red light district." He described the downtown as "a grim 
sight" and recalled that the pier "was literally falling down." 
</P>
<P>
Years later, in 1981, the city invited Cicoletti to hear pleas for developers 
to take an interest in Oceanside. He toured the long-neglected beach area and 
decided "from a real estate perspective, this is a great piece of property. 
From a demographic standpoint, it's a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
"They needed a large development as a catalyst to turn the beachfront around 
for residences," he said. He competed with nine other developers and won an 
agreement in 1983 to build a multiple housing project. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the city's zeal for the project, Cicoletti and his partners couldn't 
get a real estate loan from the bank. They had to put up their personal assets 
to secure a credit loan. 
</P>
<P>
First, Cicoletti replaced "shacks" with 50 affordable units that sold in the 
mid-'80s for $50,000 to $75,000. Then, he built the first 54 units in his San 
Miguel project, on The Strand and 6th Street, and in 1986 sold the ocean-view 
units at market price for $165,000. 
</P>
<P>
When he recently completed the third phase of the four-phase, 243-unit San 
Miguel project, "that same unit sold for $399,000," a sum well below the 
$500,000 to $600,000 a comparable condo would fetch along the coast of Orange 
County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate sources in Orange County agreed, reporting that lower-end condos 
with coastal access there go for about $400,000 to $500,000, while a top-price 
beach condo costs about $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Oceanside is still undiscovered," Cicoletti said. 
</P>
<P>
That is changing as customers buy San Miguel's smaller units for second homes 
and the larger units for their permanent address. But far more than 
representing an isolated success, the San Miguel project has given the signal 
that Oceanside's coastal neighborhoods are again fit for living. 
</P>
<P>
"It had a hell of a significance, it was a benchmark," said police Sgt. Bill 
Krunglevich, who vividly remembers the area's crime problem. Beside attracting 
newcomers, San Miguel sparked pride among existing residents, he said. "It's 
generated a lot of people to take a second look at their property as an 
investment rather than an albatross." 
</P>
<P>
The influx of new projects has created a climate in which older single-family 
homes might be sold and demolished to make way for multiple-unit developments. 
Residential areas in the redevelopment zone allow up to 34 units per acre, 
stirring some concern that the coast could become a jumble of condos crowding 
out the homes. Hightman said, "We do have some nice single-family homes, and we 
don't want to kick them out." 
</P>
<P>
However, the reality of the marketplace may bode otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Daniel, a real estate agent, said, "Proximity to a beach creates the strong 
value here. You're going to see the financial pressure toward tearing down and 
building new ones (dwellings)." 
</P>
<P>
The trend toward high-density development has put some area residents on guard, 
although their concern has not turned into a cohesive protest. As Cressman 
said: "I don't want too many high-rises. It really affects the look." 
</P>
<P>
The presence of condos side-by-side with single-family homes does not seem to 
discourage buyers. 
</P>
<P>
David Hadsell, who owns a home in Oceanside, recalls that much of The Strand 
"was a no-man's land" in the 1960s, "back when we all went to the beaches in 
Carlsbad" instead. 
</P>
<P>
But he was so impressed with San Miguel that he bought a unit 15 months ago for 
$260,000. "It was originally intended to be a rental unit, but it's so nice, we 
use it on weekends." 
</P>
<P>
As a witness to area's sad history, he figures he should not miss a chance to 
invest in its revival. "To get beachfront property at an affordable price that 
will appreciate in value, it's an investment we love dearly. We couldn't afford 
not to invest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hadsell isn't alone. Despite the generally flat housing market, sales are brisk 
at the Oceanside coast. 
</P>
<P>
When the San Miguel second phase of 70 units was completed in late 1988, each 
was sold within three weeks, said Paula Barksdale-Berry, development broker. 
The recently completed third phase of 56 units is sold out, and the 58-unit 
fourth phase, which is not yet finished, is half sold. 
</P>
<P>
She said San Miguel "definitely boosted all the prices along the beach. Little 
bitty places were selling a year or two ago for $200,000 or $250,000. We just 
closed one at $500,000." 
</P>
<P>
For Cressman, who is now unafraid to stand alone behind the counter of the 
South Jetty surf shop, the arrival of the pier and the San Miguel project came 
about the time that she and Sean were struggling to rehabilitate their own 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
After having someone get stabbed on their front porch and the routine sightings 
of hookers and drug dealers, they put up a fence and a security light. "That 
was the beginning of the change in our little cul-de-sac. It seemed to 
snowball. A lot of the neighbors started fixing their houses up. We formed our 
own block watch. It took awhile, none of us are rich. It just took sweat and 
blood."

STREET SMART: STATE COULD DO MORE TO ENFORCE ITS VEHICLE SAFETY LAWS

Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
Why do I see so many vehicles that have either been altered or are plain wrecks 
going down the road practically sideways? New York and Maryland have some 
progressive laws that California would do well to consider: 
</P>
<P>
* A safety inspection is performed along with the smog check. 
</P>
<P>
* An insurance voucher must be provided for registration tags to be issued. 
</P>
<P>
* Violators have their vehicles towed away and impounded; they are not merely 
given citations. 
</P>
<P>
* A car that has suffered major damage in a crash can't return to the road 
without a safety inspection. 
</P>
<P>
I challenge our governor and the Department of Motor Vehicles to get their act 
together. I bet that they would not only collect delinquent fees, but also get 
a lot of uninsured motorists off the road.

Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
What happened to the requirement that a car have two headlights and two tail 
and stop lights? Cars without these, along with those missing front or rear 
fenders, are the ones driving in and out of the lanes with no brains or 
insurance behind them. 
</P>
<P>
They say there is no money for the safety-check lanes. What about the fines? 
It's high time that we put in insurance and safety checks just like those for 
smog equipment and registration. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Your points are well taken. Although several states have laws requiring regular 
safety checks, California has been conspicuously lax when it comes to ensuring 
that the vehicles on its roads are up to snuff. The responsibility is left up 
to the individual motorist, and we all know what that sometimes means. 
</P>
<P>
California at one time did have a program in which special Highway Patrol units 
flagged down motorists to do spot safety checks. It died in the early '70s, 
when funding for it dried up. It appears that since then, no one in state 
government has had the political will to push for such a program along with the 
tough schedule of fines that would be needed to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
The state has performed a bit better on the insurance front. Although 
California does not require proof of insurance at registration, there is a law 
on the books mandating that all motorists carry insurance. Law enforcement 
officers will routinely ask for proof of insurance during a traffic stop. In 
addition, a law that went into effect Jan. 1 requires a motorist to show an 
insurance voucher when he or she takes a driving test. Uninsured drivers 
involved in accidents face getting their licenses suspended. 
</P>
<P>
State officials have considered the idea to require proof of insurance at the 
time of registration, but the Legislature has so far chosen not to embrace it. 
It, like mandatory safety checks at time of registration, seems like a good 
idea. But perhaps the only way you'll see it be a reality is to approach your 
local representative in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
We constantly hear that more money is needed to pay for additional freeways, 
improvements, etc. I am aware of one untapped source of funds that would 
certainly pay for at least a mile or two of highways -- the huge number of 
vehicles on our streets and highways without current registration. 
</P>
<P>
Now that 1990 and 1991 stickers are in place on most rear bumpers, the red 1989 
stickers are really noticeable. I commute less than 30 miles round-trip five 
days a week. Recently, I started counting red stickers and usually see 10 to 12 
each way. If my small sample is valid, there must be thousands of such cars and 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in uncollected registration fees. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicles without current registration are not just old junky cars whose 
owners presumably would not be paying much of a fee anyway. I see new and 
expensive cars just as often. Maybe we need an 800 number so we can report 
these babies the same way we can report cars that emit pollution (800 CUTSMOG). 
That at least gives one the satisfaction of doing something. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Motor Vehicles does have an investigative unit to which you 
can report such things, but my single experience with them was not very 
fruitful. 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, I wrote to them about a neighbor whose out-of-state 
registration expired two years ago. A second letter yielded a telephone call 
from a nice gentleman but no other apparent result. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it might be worth a try. In Orange County, you can write to the 
Department of Motor Vehicles, Investigations Section, 909 W. Valencia Drive, 
Fullerton, Calif., 92632. The phone number is (714) 680-7941. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks for letting me tell you about my pet peeve.

Although it is unclear what happened in this particular instance, the DMV over 
the past year has been focusing a considerable amount of attention on tracking 
down motorists whose auto registrations aren't up to date, said Gina McGuiness, 
a DMV spokeswoman in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The department has instituted a special program designed to track down 
unregistered cars through parking tickets, moving violations and reports from 
disgruntled neighbors. The goal is indeed to recover the millions of dollars of 
registration fees owed the state by people flouting vehicle registration 
requirements. That money goes for roads, the Highway Patrol and other motoring 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The DMV also has an investigations unit in Irvine, at 18231 McDurmott West, 
Suite 100, Irvine, Calif. 92714; (714) 476-9260. The investigations units also 
handle a variety of other complaints about motor vehicles.

WILCOX PUTS LIGHT TOUCH ON CAMPAIGN; 
</P>
<P>
ASSEMBLY: THE GOP AIDE SEEKING TO SUCCEED MARIAN LA FOLLETTE (R-NORTHRIDGE) 
HOPES COMEDY WILL MAKE HIM A SERIOUS CONTENDER IN THE 38TH DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Last Wednesday, a young state Assembly candidate took the microphone as a 
roomful of Republican campaign contributors loosened their belts after a 
fund-raising dinner. But the candidate didn't deliver the predictable speech 
about the need to crack down on criminals and unleash private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
He did impersonations. 
</P>
<P>
First he did Ronald Reagan, mimicking the ex-President's avuncular laugh and 
mannerisms. Then he did George Bush, Dean Martin and George Burns. 
</P>
<P>
And when candidate Robert Wilcox wound up his routine, his audience applauded 
-- if not thunderously, at least warmly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm following Ronald Reagan's footsteps," said Wilcox, 24, in a recent 
interview. "First show business, then politics." 
</P>
<P>
Since his high school days, Wilcox, an aide to GOP Assemblywoman Marian W. La 
Follette of Northridge, has moonlighted as an amateur impressionist at 
open-mike nights, company parties and GOP dinners. 
</P>
<P>
But for the next three months at least, Wilcox will be concentrating on 
politics as he campaigns to replace La Follette in the Republican-dominated 
38th Assembly District, which arcs across the northern San Fernando Valley from 
Hidden Hills to Tujunga. 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, La Follette abruptly announced that she will not seek reelection 
and, in a familiar political baton-passing ritual, endorsed Wilcox to succeed 
her. Wilcox also is expected to be backed by La Follette's longtime ally, state 
Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), in his quest for the GOP nomination in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox's heir-apparent status didn't last long. Two days after La Follette's 
surprise revelation, Granada Hills real estate broker Paula Boland, a longtime 
GOP grass-roots activist, announced that she would challenge Wilcox in the June 
5 primary. 
</P>
<P>
Boland, 50, was swiftly endorsed by two prominent GOP figures in the Valley, 
Assemblywoman Cathie Wright of Simi Valley and Los Angeles City Councilman Hal 
Bernson. And political observers predict a number of other candidates will make 
a bid for the seat, which La Follette has held for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his youth, Wilcox is a seasoned veteran of local GOP political battles 
and is considered a strong contender to succeed La Follette. At age 15, he was 
youth chairman of Davis' first state Senate campaign. After a stint as a 
part-time field representative for Davis, Wilcox joined Davis' ill-fated 1986 
campaign for the U.S. Senate, acting as campaign coordinator and helping with 
fund raising and speech writing. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, he has been an aide to La Follette, gaining visibility as a prime 
mover behind her long but unsuccessful campaign to carve the sprawling, 
610,000-student Los Angeles Unified School District into smaller districts. 
</P>
<P>
With his slightly oversized glasses and suits that seem to flap a bit on his 
gangly 6-foot, 4-inch frame, Wilcox has the air of a high school Latin teacher 
on his first day of class. But in Valley Republican circles, he is known as a 
clever political coalition-builder and deal maker. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to persuade Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates to run for mayor 
last year, for example, Wilcox quietly raised enough money to perform 
preliminary opinion polling for Gates, according to Eric Rose, 24, a close 
friend and fellow GOP worker. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilcox has shown unusual precociousness in entertainment as well as 
politics. His impressions are so popular in some circles that he is sometimes 
paid for his appearances, and he admits to being star-struck by performers from 
Frank Sinatra to songwriter Sammy Kahn. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm telling this story against my better judgment, but I won "The Gong Show" 
when I was 12 years old," Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
"I did this celebrity news routine. I had George Burns interviewing Jimmy 
Carter in the Rose Garden. I had Jack Benny doing the weather. And Richard 
Nixon did commercials," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An on-and-off student at Cal State Northridge since 1983, he is a journalism 
major and hopes to work someday as a television news reporter. But for years he 
has fantasized about breaking into show business. 
</P>
<P>
"I flirted around with getting into show business full time, " he said. "I love 
entertaining -- singing and dancing -- the kind of old-time entertainment that 
doesn't exist anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, Sammy Davis Jr. or Jerry Lewis -- they're the kind of all-around 
entertainers who don't exist anymore. . . . To see people out there smiling and 
enjoying themselves, that means a lot to me." 
</P>
<P>
Raised in the Valley, Wilcox was the third child of a McDonnell Douglas 
computer analyst and a housewife. A churchgoing Presbyterian, he attended the 
private Los Angeles Baptist High School in Sepulveda, where he was student body 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"We had Bible classes every day," he said. "Some teachers would start every 
class with a prayer. It definitely had a fundamentalist Christian outlook." 
</P>
<P>
A conservative, Wilcox favors an end to bilingual education in Los Angeles 
public schools and mandatory anti-drug education for students beginning in 
kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
He said business must provide more money and "take leadership" in the war on 
drugs. He opposes creating new landfills or expanding existing ones in the 38th 
District, an issue that has been one of La Follette's biggest political 
headaches. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wilcox said he will vigorously continue La Follette's efforts to 
break up the Los Angeles school district. 
</P>
<P>
Many political figures associated with the Davis and La Follette camps praise 
Wilcox as intelligent, energetic and an excellent public speaker. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he'll be very approachable, with good intelligence and good 
conservative instincts," said Davis, Wilcox's longtime political mentor. "And I 
think he'll have a lot of potential. He has an excellent ability to express 
himself, much better than most people at age 24." 
</P>
<P>
But others who know Wilcox are less than flattering. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Rob cares about the district," said one person who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. "He just wants to be an elected official and have the 
prestige and glamour he thinks goes along with that. Rob's a great one to have 
over at your house for a party. But I'm not sure he's a great one to have in 
the Assembly." 
</P>
<P>
Some local observers said Wilcox's backing from Davis and La Follette will make 
him hard to beat in the GOP primary, especially given the recent upsurge of 
support for La Follette's school district breakup efforts. 
</P>
<P>
But other analysts think Wilcox will be hampered by his age and his lack of 
name recognition. And they say Boland, given her backing by Wright and Bernson, 
could be a formidable candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Republican observers with a longer view worry that a bitter, expensive primary 
battle between Wilcox and Boland -- and perhaps others -- could weaken the GOP 
nominee enough to open the door to a Democratic upset in November. 
</P>
<P>
However, Republicans outnumber Democrats in the district by about 12,500. And 
so far, only two Democrats -- Irene Allert and Gary Crandall -- have filed for 
the seat, and neither is well known.

A 20-year-old who police said associated with gang members was found shot to 
death late Saturday on a sidewalk in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Martin Luna of Van Nuys was apparently killed instantly after he was shot 
in the lower torso by an assailant, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Ted Hanson said. 
Residents of the 14800 block of Delano Street told authorities they heard 
gunshots about 11:15 p.m. and saw Luna lying on the ground, Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
Luna, who was pronounced dead at the scene, was not a member of a gang but he

COOPERATIVE EFFORT MAKES THE GRADE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE LOS ANGELES SCHOOLS' NEW LEADERSHIP COUNCILS OFFER THE 
OPPORTUNITY FOR TEACHERS, PARENTS AND THE WIDER COMMUNITY TO TURN DIALOGUE INTO 
ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELEN BERNSTEIN, Helen Bernstein, secondary vice president of United 
Teachers-Los Angeles, was part of the team that negotiated for the leadership 
councils. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers care about schools. But caring about schools, or about children for 
that matter, is not enough to make a good environment for learning. Student 
achievement has suffered because our schools are outdated. Our school system 
has operated with a dysfunctional relationship between teachers and principals. 
Teachers have been relegated to passive roles, used to having to ask 
permission. A culture of paternalism exists in our schools that has a history 
as long as the existence of public education itself. This results in teacher 
demoralization, lack of initiative and creativity and stagnation of the 
educational system. But times are changing. 
</P>
<P>
Within schools, in the state Legislature, among interested civic groups, 
businesses and in the press, a meaningful dialogue about school reform has 
begun at last. Teachers will be the essential contributors to this dialogue 
because it is teachers who are responsible for the fundamental task of 
education: engaging kids in effective learning. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, strong teachers' union leadership has been at the forefront of all 
significant restructuring efforts. Restructuring involves taking risks. Union 
strength allows members to take the initiative in improving the classroom 
environment and branching out more aggressively by demanding more information 
and more training. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, as part of the contract negotiated to improve student achievement, 
decentralized decision-making was introduced into the Los Angeles schools. As a 
result, local school leadership councils made up of teachers, parents, 
administrators, students, classified personnel and community members will have 
the opportunity to design their schools to meet the needs of their clientele 
through shared decision-making and, ultimately, school-based management. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, teachers will be getting a major voice, along with parents, 
concerning ways to educate our children. These efforts will not be uniformly 
productive, and change will not happen overnight. But by keeping the question 
of what is best for children in front of us, we can all begin to identify ways 
to improve the educational fortunes of our students. 
</P>
<P>
We also need to ensure that as many qualified people as possible enter the 
teaching profession. The shortage of teachers has spawned emergency credential 
programs. Lowering the qualifications necessary to enter any field threatens 
the professionalism of those already in it. Teaching continues to attract 
outstanding people, but it does so despite the entry standards, not because of 
them. Lack of respect, low wages and little, if any, resource support are 
discouraging many talented people from teaching. The long-term vitality and 
effectiveness of our educational enterprise will be determined by the nature of 
the people who devote their professional lives to it. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, we need to change the system of incentives. For teachers there are 
few institutional incentives that support creative, energetic efforts to 
improve education: Pay and performance are not linked, and advancement means 
leaving the classroom, so those remaining are consequently denigrated. 
Incentive systems must be put into place so that the best teachers continue to 
teach. Working directly with children needs to be both valued and rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
As a community we need to do everything we can to ensure that our children are 
ready to learn when they start school. We need to take responsibility for 
students' successful transition from school, whether directly into the work 
force or to higher education. 
</P>
<P>
Through the leadership councils those most concerned about student achievement 
have the opportunity to shape our schools. Most important, the most inspired 
teachers will ultimately be allowed to participate in all decisions affecting 
the classroom. Energy previously expended on frustration finally can be 
redirected toward positive ends. 
</P>
<P>
The need for a better-educated populace has brought our schools under close 
scrutiny. The emerging dialogue has thrust public education into a new era. The 
only question is what reforms will be adopted and with what results, in the 
face of inevitable, discomforting, imminent change. 
</P>
<P>
School reform is everyone's business. Reform and increased financial resources 
for children must be our highest priorities. We finally have a decentralized 
decision-making structure that should enable teachers, parents and the broader 
community to participate. Now is the time to transform our dialogue into 
action. Our future depends on it.

IN THE FACE OF THIS RUTHLESS FOE, CIVIL LIBERTIES COME SECOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAYDEN, Tom Hayden (D-West Los Angeles) is a member of the state 
Assembly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the triumphs of freedom in Eastern Europe and Nicaragua, we cannot let 
down our defenses against the newest threat of silent infiltration and 
subversion. 
</P>
<P>
We are talking about the Medfly, of course, and its threat to our way of life, 
including our free-enterprise system. 
</P>
<P>
The MF, having taken Hawaii, is now invading Southern California, hidden in the 
civilian population, a classic guerrilla strategy. Their destination: through 
the mountainous "grapevine" into the heartland of middle America itself. 
</P>
<P>
MF terrorism is particularly fiendish -- defacing cars, poisoning animals, 
sexually molesting California citrus, producing maggots that literally feast on 
and destroy virgin flesh, especially the innocent peach. 
</P>
<P>
After nine years of this struggle, the MF troop totals have unexpectedly risen, 
largely due to their willing capacity to sacrifice their own kind. 
</P>
<P>
Because of their clandestine methods, only 237 MFs have been found in 25,000 
traps in Southern California. But our computer models project that there are as 
many as 1,000 MFs for every one taken prisoner. That means 237,000 of these 
fanatics are massed for attack. 
</P>
<P>
That is why aerial bombardment must continue even if there are inadvertent and 
regrettable consequences for the civilian population. 
</P>
<P>
Our defense cannot rely on the demoralized ranks of the Contra fruit flies. In 
order to maintain their loyalty, these troops have been rendered sterile and, 
frankly, the security of red-blooded Americans cannot be trusted to a bunch of 
sissies. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious threat, however, is from within. We are seeing pacifist 
attitudes begin to take root in mainstream California opinion. This so-called 
"movement" is manipulated by professional agitators whose real agenda is an MF 
takeover of our country. These traitors, with their liberal sympathizers in the 
media, are recruiting thousands of nervous Nellies who cannot stomach 
helicopter sorties even at safe ranges of 100 feet from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
This sinister pattern raises the fundamental question of whether democracy can 
compete with a ruthless enemy who has no respect for civil liberties or life 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot afford this threat on our soil. The time for polite measures is over. 
Only a more determined assault on the very birth rate of the MF will force the 
enemy to negotiations or Nicaragua-style elections, but that day is still far 
off. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the rising dovishness must be contained by the release of our White 
Paper and the promise that sterile MF reservists will be called from Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Where blood is spilled in this conflict, we must be careful that it be MF 
blood. The American people must support the war with funds and a minimum of 
inconvenience, though the loss of pets is inevitable. In the event that 
California goes soft, the U.S. government itself must be ready to prosecute 
this war to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
Take no prisoners. Kill the maggots. Nail the coonskin to the wall. Extremism 
in pursuit of liberty is no vice. Stand up, America!

non-competitive socialism in the U.S. -- by which I mean Reagan-Bush-type

"Last week 36 million tickets were sold with no winner . . . imagine one 
individual spent $36 million on tickets. He would have lost everything," 
(letter, Feb. 23). 
</P>
<P>
There are two major fallacies in this argument. First, 36 million tickets sold 
does not mean that 36 million different numerical permutations were entered. 
</P>
<P>
Two or more people often come up with the same 6 numbers as their entry. If one 
person bought 36 million tickets for himself, he would have a much better 
chance of winning than 36 million people independently buying one ticket each. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the mythical $36-million ticket purchaser would probably not have 
"lost everything." Monetary awards are given for combinations of 3, 4 and 5 
numbers correct, as well as 5 plus the bonus number. Just because no one wins 
the big prize one week doesn't mean that thousands of $5 and up prizes are not 
won. 
</P>
<P>
Thank heavens some of the lottery money goes to help schools. Perhaps we will 
finally have citizens properly educated in logic and mathematics!

This is the precious processing of poor patients by dedicated professionals,

CORPORATE WELFARE STATE IS ON A ROLL; 
</P>
<P>
TAXES: FROM S&amp;L BAILOUTS TO CUT-RATE TIMBER LEASES TO TOXIC CLEANUPS, IT'S 
THE INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER FOOTING THE BILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH NADER, Ralph Nader is co-author of The Big Boys: Power and Position in 
American Business, (Pantheon). 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Raiding taxpayer assets is the big game in Washington, but not everyone can 
play. From bailouts to outright giveaways and from military procurement fraud 
to bloated subsidies, our national government has become a golden accounts 
receivable for hordes of organized, corporate claimants who lobby daily to get 
something for nothing or a lot for a little. 
</P>
<P>
Taxpayers and their lobbying groups focus on tax rates and loopholes, paying 
insufficient attention to misappropriation of their dollars by corporate 
welfarists. One reason for this inattention is that the laws shut taxpayers out 
-- they may not petition the offending agencies and departments or take them to 
court for the arbitrary and capricious transfer of taxpayer assets to corporate 
use and control. The stakes are enormous for both present and future 
generations of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Four areas of abuse are booming: 
</P>
<P>
Bailouts. The prominent bailouts of the 1970s -- the $250-million Lockheed loan 
guarantee and the $1.5-billion Chrysler loan guarantee -- were legislated after 
public hearings and now look like small change. The taxpayer bailout of the 
wreckage caused by fraud and speculation in the savings and loan industry will 
reach at least $300 billion before the dust settles. Estimates of cleanup costs 
for U.S. nuclear weapons plants, managed by private firms such as DuPont and 
North American Rockwell, range from $50 billion to $150 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Bailouts are increasingly being shaped and decided with fewer and fewer 
congressional standards. In December, 1988, in a secret frenzy of 
round-the-clock giveaways, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board unloaded the assets 
of dozens of S&amp;Ls into the laps of financiers who had to invest 
comparatively tiny amounts of their own capital, while the board assumed 
open-ended liability for these failing institutions. The board obligated the 
taxpayers for more than $40 billion in this feeding frenzy, without any 
congressional authorization. Congress turned down efforts to reopen these deals 
(whose full texts are still secret) and instead retroactively ratified the 
board's wildcat indebtedness. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate the lucrativeness of these back-room bonanzas: One financier, 
Ronald Perelman, recouped 80% on his investment in a Texas S&amp;L in just the 
first 90 days after concluding his deal with the board. 
</P>
<P>
It is not corporate taxpayers who must endure the bailout burden of these 
corporate scandals; it is primarily the small taxpayer, who neither caused nor 
benefited from the scandals. 
</P>
<P>
Resource depletion. Public lands make up one-third of the United States. The 
laws declare them to be commonwealth: They are owned by the people in trust for 
posterity and managed largely by the Departments of the Interior and 
Agriculture. For a century, in a trend that accelerated under the Ronald 
Reagan-James Watt regime, rich mineral rights, timberland and other wealth have 
been taken from the commonwealth and leased at bargain-basement prices to 
corporations. The cost to taxpayers to facilitate private cutting of virgin 
timber lands is more than 10 times what they get back in royalties. One Alaskan 
pulp mill paid $2.12 for a 100-foot-high spruce, while taxpayers footed the 
bill for roads to make the cutting possible. Third World nations demand tougher 
royalty agreements from U.S. oil companies than our own government does. The 
under-reporting and under-payment of royalties, and the longer-range depletion 
and destruction of public natural resources, erode these taxpayer assets. 
</P>
<P>
Taxpayer-funded research and development. This giveaway also expanded rapidly 
under the Reagan Administration. The prevailing practice is to give exclusive 
patents on government-financed inventions to private contractors. Even 
inventions generated by government laboratories are being given over to private 
business. The National Cancer Institute, which developed the application of the 
drug AZT against AIDS, allowed Burroughs Wellcome, Inc. to obtain an exclusive 
patent to market the medicine without any price restraints or royalties. A 
year's treatment with AZT costs from $6,000 to $10,000. Under Medicaid, the 
taxpayers are paying twice for a drug their taxes developed for clinical use. 
Total federal and state purchases of AZT from Burroughs Wellcome between 1982 
and 1987 are estimated at $2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government funds nearly half of the nation's R&amp;D. Taxpayers, 
who provide the roots for this work, are denied the fruits, which mostly flow 
into corporate coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Subsidies to profit-making businesses. Perhaps the most grotesque example of 
corporate welfare is the millions of dollars in Urban Development Action Grants 
and other subsidies given to General Motors in 1981 to build an automated 
Cadillac plant in Detroit. There are many examples of UDAG grants going to 
profitable companies, along with a large menu of other direct grant and subsidy 
programs. There are even subsidies for exporting nuclear power plants and 
tobacco. The overall value of these corporate welfare payments is easily more 
than $100 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
There are simply no open administrative procedures, as there are with 
environmental and consumer regulations, for taxpayer participation in the use 
and disposition of such public wealth. The Supreme Court has ruled that federal 
taxpayers cannot appeal to the courts to stop waste, fraud and unlawful 
conversion of taxpayer assets because they have "no standing to sue." The usual 
argument by the court is that a taxpayer's interest is shared with millions of 
others and is comparatively minute and indeterminable. When Richard Nixon's 
White House aides were openly using their time and government facilities to 
advance his reelection campaign in 1972, a federal court refused to admit a 
taxpayer's suit to enjoin such unlawful behavior because of the standing issue. 
Even 50 million taxpayers in a class action would not have made a difference to 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
Many states give taxpayers standing to sue state government. Some explicitly 
authorize taxpayers to sue as private attorneys general to uphold the laws that 
officials are ignoring. If President Bush and Congress really are serious about 
preventing taxpayer assets from being looted, mismanaged or converted to 
private parties, legislation is needed to protect the public's property from 
giveaways, as in the patent area; to establish procedures that will assure more 
open and accountable government policy-making regarding taxpayer assets, and 
give taxpayers standing, under what constitutional lawyers call a 
"participant-review provision," to defend their interests in federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of billions of dollars in tax-payer assets have been squandered. It is 
time to give taxpayers the means to correct these injustices. After all, they 
pay the bills.

FUGITIVE HENCHMAN OF HADDAD STREET; 
</P>
<P>
NAZI: ALOIS BRUNNER SENT 128,000 JEWS TO THEIR DEATHS. SYRIA, WHICH HAS 
HARBORED BRUNNER FOR 30 YEARS, SHOULD TURN HIM OVER FOR PROSECUTION FOR WAR 
CRIMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER HELLMAN, Peter Hellman is author of the forthcoming book Heroes: Tales 
From the Israeli Wars (Henry Holt). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just about all the important Nazi criminals have been jailed, punished or have 
died of natural causes. The exception is former SS officer Alois Brunner, 
henchman to Adolf Eichmann and merciless hunter of Jews during the Nazi years. 
</P>
<P>
For 30 years, Brunner has found safe haven in Damascus. Now 77, he lives openly 
in an apartment building at 7 Haddad St. His home is constantly guarded by 
armed members of the Syrian security force. Though masquerading as Dr. Georg 
Fischer, he admitted to a German magazine, Bunte, in a 1985 interview, that he 
is indeed Brunner. Only the Syrian government insists that his name is Fischer. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Serge Klarsfeld, the French historian and Nazi hunter, went to 
Damascus to ask Syrian President Hafez Assad (not for the first time) to 
extradite Brunner to France, West Germany or Austria. All three countries seek 
Brunner's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Brunner joined the Nazi Party in 1931 at 19. By late 1938 he was a founding 
member of Eichmann's infamous Central Office for Jewish Emigration in Vienna. 
Throughout the war, he traveled around occupied Europe, deporting Jews to the 
death camps from Austria, Greece, France and Slovakia -- about 128,000 in all. 
</P>
<P>
Brunner, in the words of historian Mary Felstiner, had "no preoccupation but 
genocide." His colleague in the deportation service, Dieter Wisliceny, referred 
to Brunner on the eve of the Nuremberg trials as "one of the best tools of 
Eichmann." 
</P>
<P>
Consider, by way of support for this appraisal, the convoy of 1,300 Jews that 
Brunner sent from the Paris suburb of Drancy to Auschwitz on July 31, 1944. 
Filling that train hadn't been easy, since able-bodied Jews were by then 
becoming hard to find in France (more than 75,000 had already been deported). 
Brunner took sick and elderly Jews from hospitals and 300 children under the 
age of 18 to fill the train. 
</P>
<P>
Brunner slipped into obscurity after the war. It's been reported that, like 
Klaus Barbie, he may have been on the U.S. payroll in the early phases of the 
Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
Brunner surfaced in Damascus as Fischer in 1954 -- the same year he was 
sentenced to death for war crimes by a French tribunal. He became an agent for 
German manufacturers. In 1960 Syrian police arrested "Dr. Fischer." They 
thought, apparently, that money he was sending to his wife in Germany came from 
drug dealing. When he revealed himself as a fugitive Nazi rather than a drug 
dealer, he was released. Brunner went on to provide security services to Syria. 
</P>
<P>
Brunner's case has a personal urgency for Klarsfeld. In September, 1943, 
Brunner led a special Gestapo commando unit to hunt down Jews in Nice. 
Klarsfeld was then 8 years old. One night, the Gestapo came calling. Arno 
Klarsfeld directed his wife, son and daughter to a hiding place behind a false 
wall. He was quickly deported to Auschwitz and murdered. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Serge Klarsfeld nor his wife Beate had been allowed out of the Damascus 
airport in their earlier on-site attempts at gaining Brunner's expulsion. In 
January, Klarsfeld managed a four-day stay. But he failed to get anyone in the 
government to accept his letter to Assad and the foreign minister asking for 
Brunner's return to justice. The French ambassador also attempted to deliver 
the letter to the foreign ministry on Klarsfeld's behalf but was unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Klarsfeld's mission to Damascus last month went unnoticed in the U.S. press. 
There's a simple reason for that. Assad, while occasionally granting visas to 
Western journalists, does not permit them to be posted in Syria. When Robert 
Fisk, a London Times reporter, tried to interview Brunner in 1983, he was told 
pointedly by an official spokesman, "I think you want to keep good relations 
with Syria." 
</P>
<P>
The lack of attention to the Brunner case is ironic, given the worldwide focus 
a few years ago on Klaus Barbie. Barbie took 41 children from the Izieu 
orphanage for deportation to Auschwitz in 1944. It was Brunner who sent those 
children to be murdered. 
</P>
<P>
Each morning at 10 o'clock, Brunner takes a walk in Zenobia Park, near his 
home, flanked by a pair of guards. His health is said to be poor. To many, it 
seems time to let an old man die in peace. That is precisely what the 
Klarsfelds don't believe Brunner has a right to do. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Brunner seems not to have mellowed. In his interview with the 
magazine Bunte, he claimed he had "no bad conscience" for "getting rid of that 
garbage" -- his term for those he deported. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1988, Jesse Jackson, at the Klarsfelds' urging, wrote to Assad, 
asking him to expel Brunner. It was to Jackson, after all, that Assad had 
released the U.S. Navy flyer taken in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's letter did no good. The Syrian government still maintains the fiction 
that the old German living under armed guard on Haddad Street is Georg Fischer. 
</P>
<P>
Why doesn't Assad give up Brunner? For a country long identified with 
terrorism, it would be an easy way for him to gain points in the court of 
Western opinion. And lately, according to the U.S. State Department, Assad has 
shown more interest in doing just that. He even promised last spring to cause 
anyone in his country responsible for the bombing of PanAm Flight 103 to be 
"brought to justice." 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, not Brunner? The only plausible answer, given the silence from 
Syria, is offered by Klarsfeld: "Assad must like playing host to Nazis."

<P>
As the airplane bound from Moscow for the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius was 
about to touch down, images of the distant past were racing through my mind. I 
had to steady myself to confirm that I was going to land again in the country 
of my birth. I was going to be in the midst of historic events that would 
decide the future of this country and might affect the future of the Soviet 
Union itself. 
</P>
<P>
I could not help but recall the moments in 1944 when my parents and I had to 
flee the country by means of a horse and buggy to escape the Russian tanks that 
were in pursuit of the German army. 
</P>
<P>
A lot has happened since then. The country and its people have undergone an 
oppression unparalleled in its history. It had to withstand deportation of 
350,000 of its citizens to Siberia, most of whom died there of hunger and 
exposure. Some of them were my relatives. An additional 900,000 people were 
displaced to other parts of Russia or its occupied territories to make room for 
the Russians -- all a part of Stalin's plan of genocide. It had to withstand 
the imprisonment and killing of many of its statesmen, teachers, doctors, 
businessmen and priests; the closing of schools, seminaries and convents; the 
conversion of churches to warehouses and museums of atheism. It also had to 
withstand a perverted justice system in which any normal pursuit of freedom was 
considered a crime and the dehumanization in the name of Lenin was considered a 
virtue. 
</P>
<P>
But history has taught us that tyranny always comes to an end, because the 
human spirit cannot be enslaved forever. The events in the Soviet Union are a 
consequence of the same desires for liberty expressed by our own founding 
fathers. The only question remaining is whether in the transition the dying 
monster called communism will wag its destructive tail a la Tian An Men Square 
before giving up its ghost. 
</P>
<P>
And so the consequences of Feb. 24's first multi-party elections in Lithuania 
in 50 years were seen as a clue not only to the further developments in this 
Baltic Republic, but also in the Soviet Union itself. 
</P>
<P>
The answers started emerging as the election results began coming in. Sajudis 
candidates captured 72 of the 90 seats decided. Runoff elections must still be 
held in 45 districts where no candidate received a majority and new candidates 
have to be nominated in six additional districts because of pre-election 
irregularities generated by the Communist Party. But it is now predicted that 
the Sajudis-supported candidates will win a substantial share of the additional 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
What does all of it mean? The platform adopted by the Sajudis Election 
Conference on Feb. 3 stated that the main objective in the areas of foreign and 
domestic policy, economy, culture, social welfare and ecology is total and 
complete independence. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian vote was therefore a referendum on the platform for 
independence. The overwhelming vote in favor of the platform makes it clear to 
Moscow as well as the West what the people want. 
</P>
<P>
The vote shook up Moscow rulers. They immediately began drafting legislation in 
the Supreme Soviet to give themselves the power to declare an emergency in any 
republic regardless of whether the republic itself wants to declare such a 
condition. This means that Moscow can declare an emergency on any pretext and 
move in to take care of any problem it perceives is threatening its strategic 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, these elections will also force the West to declare its 
position on Lithuania's independence. Our government in particular will be 
forced to get off the fence. So far it has religiously supported the 
longstanding U.S. policy of non-recognition of Lithuania's incorporation into 
the Soviet Union. But recent comments to the press by the President and the 
secretary of state consider the question of independence of the Baltic 
countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia as an internal affair of the Soviet 
Union. Well, which way is it going to be? 
</P>
<P>
This kind of double talk is not new to the Balts. They felt abandoned by the 
world in 1940 when the Russian tanks rolled in, then again at Yalta and Potsdam 
at the end of World War II when the four superpowers decided on the borders of 
Eastern Europe, leaving the Balts enslaved. Then again by President Ford at 
Helsinki, where in exchange for human rights in the Soviet Union, the existing 
borders were implicitly accepted as valid. How is our President going to act 
now? 
</P>
<P>
When I left Lithuania last Tuesday, it was determined to continue its quest 
toward total independence. The first battle was won! The people have spoken, 
the message is clear, their voices are crying out to the world to take notice 
and to come, finally, to their aid. 
</P>
<P>
It is good to be back home and to relish again the freedom that is normally 
taken for granted here. But I came back concerned whether the election far away 
in Lithuania will have any meaning to my neighbors and friends, and whether 
support can be garnered to reestablish democracy there. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the dramatic election results, I have fears for my relatives in 
Lithuania. There is still the threat that the Russians will retaliate and shut 
off vital supplies of heating and motor vehicle fuels and medical supplies. 
There is also the underlying fear of how the Russian military will behave in 
light of the people's announced intention of declaring their independence. I am 
also apprehensive about how our government will behave because it has been 
sitting on the fence so long. Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) and 
three of his colleagues made their support clear. America, where do you stand?

<P>
Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court added a Santa Ana drug case to its list of 
more than 4,000 cases that it refused to hear this year. 
</P>
<P>
That the Supreme Court refused to hear the case should not have raised the 
concern it did. The focus instead should have been on the state appellate 
court's decision this past July. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 22, 1986, two Santa Ana police officers were patrolling a parking lot 
for drug traffickers. They saw the defendant sitting on the hood of a car. With 
one officer on each side of him, the defendant was asked if it was his car; it 
wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Following additional accusatory questions, he was asked if he had any 
identification on him. He handed one of the uniformed officers his wallet, 
which contained a small bindle of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to trial, the Superior Court conducted a suppression hearing to determine 
if the bindle had been produced in violation of the defendant's right to be 
free from unreasonable searches and seizures guaranteed to all of us by the 
U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The legal issue at the suppression hearing was relatively simple: Would a 
reasonable person feel free to leave under the circumstances. If, yes, then the 
production of the wallet was dumb but not unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing the officers tell their story and observing the defendant in the 
courtroom, a local Superior Court judge determined that a reasonable person 
would not have felt free to leave. No kidding. 
</P>
<P>
But the joke comes several months later, when the Court of Appeal decides for 
itself (without seeing the police officers or the defendant) that their version 
of a "reasonable person" would feel free to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court claimed its decision was compelled by past U.S. Supreme 
Court decisions. I don't buy it. This court went out of its way to reverse the 
trial judge and reinstate the drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
It's not surprising that the federal court refused to hear the case. If the 
California courts have a problem figuring out what a reasonable person in Santa 
Ana would do when confronted by two officers who ask accusatory questions, then 
why should federal justices 3,000 miles away interfere? The issue is best 
determined by a local trial judge who listened to and observed the witnesses in 
the courtroom as they reconstructed the Oct. 22 encounter. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, this case is nothing new for a Santa Ana trial judge. These 
judges hear dope cases every day. They see cops testify. One of the primary 
functions of the trial judge is to determine who is stretching the truth. This 
isn't done in a vacuum as the appellate court seems to think. 
</P>
<P>
The trial judge here ruled that this defendant on this particular day could 
reasonably believe he was not free to walk away from these particular police 
officers. That finding should not have been set aside on appeal by those judges 
who do not do battle in the trenches. We cannot allow our national "war" on 
drugs to take such a toll on the judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
I am bothered by the court's actual holding in this case, i.e., a reasonable 
person would have believed he was free to walk away from those officers without 
further ado. But what is more troubling is that the appellate court put aside 
its own institutional rules to overrule the suppression of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The message this sends to the trial judges is clear: You must always believe 
the testimony of government witnesses, for they never stretch the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has ever testified in court knows that there is a natural tendency 
to flavor the testimony to support one side or the other. To believe that 
police officers are immune from this tendency is to believe in fairy tales. 
Seasoned trial judges can recognize when testimony begins to lead down the 
yellow brick road. In the real world, this defendant was not free to leave. The 
Court of Appeal should rejoin the real world. 
</P>
<P>
Constitutional law is not the sole domain of the appellate courts. Indeed, the 
vast majority of constitutional decision making is done outside the judicial 
system. Every government worker has the capability of violating someone's 
constitutional rights. This includes local school boards, city councils, 
firefighters and police officers. 
</P>
<P>
These are the people who must implement court decisions that set constitutional 
boundaries. That implementation is best reviewed by local trial judges who are 
familiar with the reality of everyday government-citizen encounters. Appellate 
courts should not overturn those decisions unless there is no basis in fact for 
that judge's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
Respect for constitutional principles will erode if those principles cannot be 
applied to our daily involvement with the government. The last place one 
expects this erosion to occur is the appellate courts.

NAVRATILOVA STRUGGLES TO WIN TOURNAMENT IN BLOWOUT; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: WINDY CONDITIONS AND SUKOVA MAKE THINGS DIFFICULT IN 6-2, 5-7, 6-1 
VICTORY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Wind-blown sand pelted Martina Navratilova's glasses. Tiny grains of sand stung 
the side of her face. But that wasn't the worst part. That was when she 
swallowed. 
</P>
<P>
"I found myself crunching down on some sand morsels," Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
On a blustery Sunday afternoon when the wind blew enough sand to envelop the 
mountains across the street in a yellow-brown haze, Navratilova lost a set for 
the first time this year, but eventually blew past Helena Sukova, 6-2, 5-7, 
6-1, to win the Virginia Slims of Indian Wells at Hyatt Grand Champions. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova's 149th singles title and her third in three weeks was worth 
$70,000, which brought her earnings to $240,000 this year and $1.52 million in 
her career. 
</P>
<P>
Undefeated in 14 matches this year, Navratilova maintained her winning streak 
although it was played out in some downright difficult conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Swirling wind and gusts deposited enough sand on Stadium Court that the only 
thing missing was some cactus. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played in all kinds of weather, but never in a sandstorm," Navratilova 
said. "Easy shots became an adventure." 
</P>
<P>
And bad shots, well, let's just say they became commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the shots, I think we were a little surprised at them," said Sukova, 
who made 31 unforced errors in a roller-coaster performance. 
</P>
<P>
After losing her serve three times in an ugly first set, Sukova fell behind, 
2-5, in the second set, looked at a match point and was in danger of being 
sandblasted off the court. 
</P>
<P>
Then Sukova suddenly started ripping in first serves as if someone had thrown a 
switch to turn on her game. She held for 3-5 and broke Navratilova, who was 
serving for the set, when Navratilova's slice backhand caught a gust and flew 
long. 
</P>
<P>
Sukova's ace at 40-0 made it 5-5, she broke Navratilova at 0-40 for 6-5, fought 
off two break points in the next game and closed out the second set with a 
winning lob that dribbled off the frame of Navratilova's racket. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, it was one set all and Navratilova needed to regroup. She also 
changed her itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
"At 6-2, 5-3, I was already writing my speech," she said. "Then I started 
rushing my shots and stopped moving my feet." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova called Sukova an "escape artist," recalling that Sukova was down 
two match points before defeating Gretchen Magers. 
</P>
<P>
Informed of this description, Sukova smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't escape completely," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, who made 50 advances to the net in the second set, made only 15 in 
the third set and led, 4-0. At 5-1, 40-15, Navratilova double-faulted, but 
closed out the match with a slick backhand cross-court volley, which was her 
trademark shot all week. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova hasn't been No. 1 since Steffi Graf took over the top spot in the 
computer rankings Aug. 16, 1987. But Navratilova underwent a rigorous 
off-season training program for the first time in 14 years, skipped the 
Australian Open, and worked out hard at her home in Aspen, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed a vacation from my vacation," Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
Coached by Craig Kardon, Navratilova made a subtle change in her service motion 
that was first suggested by Billie Jean King. 
</P>
<P>
King, who has served as something of a motivational coach for Navratilova since 
last May, said Navratilova is just hitting her stride. King said she has 
emphasized two particular areas. 
</P>
<P>
"She's always been a great physical athlete and I tell her at 33, if she wants 
to keep playing, she's really going to have to improve on the emotional and 
mental side." 
</P>
<P>
And as for Graf, King said the idea is not to care about an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter who's over there, unless you're a boxer," King said. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova said she has come to realize that she is not too old to play any 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time you lose, somebody says it's because you're too old," Navratilova 
said. "That happens enough times, you start doubting yourself. I think I've 
made a statement these three tournaments. I can see all the work has paid off. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can still be No. 1 by the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Sukova was not as certain. Her record against Navratilova falling to 4-23, 
Sukova is the only player to have won a set from either Graf or Navratilova 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Steffi is No. 1 and I think she deserves to be No. 1," Sukova said. 
"She will have to start playing worse and (Navratilova) will have to start 
playing better for there to be a change." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis notes 
</P>
<P>
Attendance for Sunday's final was 6,970, just 30 short of a sellout. During the 
Newsweek Champions Cup, Stadium Court seating capacity at Hyatt Grand Champions 
is increased to 10,500. Attendance for the weekday sessions of the tournament 
disappointed Barbara Perry of IMG, which owns the two-year-old event. However, 
attendance for the week was 28,558 compared to last year's 20,644. Perry said 
that a decision whether to return the tournament to Indian Wells for a third 
year will be made in the next few weeks.

Top-seeded Brad Gilbert dominated erratic Jonas Svensson of Sweden, 6-1, 6-3, 
to win the $450,000 ABN World tournament at Rotterdam, the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, ranked fourth in the world, needed 80 minutes to win his first-ever 
tournament title in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
He earned $65,000 for his first title of the season. Svensson made $38,100. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Stich of West Germany rallied to win the final two sets for his first 
professional tournament victory, defeating Australian Wally Masur, 6-7 (7-5), 
6-4, 7-6 (7-1) in the $250,000 Volvo Indoor at Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Krickstein broke Tim Mayotte's serve twice in the final set, gaining a 
6-3, 6-4, victory Sunday to win the $300,000 Eagle round-robin tournament at

</P>
<P>
Krickstein, No. 6 in the world, broke the ninth-ranked Mayotte's service three 
times in the championship match. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was worth $100,000 for Krickstein while Mayotte earned $50,000.

NORMAN SHOOTS 62, SINKS CHIP TO WIN PLAYOFF

<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Norman chipped in for an eagle on the first extra hole and won a 
four-player sudden death playoff Sunday in the Doral Open at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Norman's 20-foot chip from behind the first green beat Paul Azinger, Mark 
Calcavecchia and Tim Simpson and capped a spectacular day's play in which he 
was 12 under par for 19 holes. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, who so often has seen remarkable last-round performances go for naught, 
rallied from seven strokes back with a course- and tournament-record 62, 10 
under par. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian capped that effort with a 35 foot par-saving putt on the final 
hole and completed the regulation 72 holes at 273, 15 under par on Doral's Blue 
Monster course. 
</P>
<P>
But Norman, who has found such remarkable methods of letting titles slip from 
his eager grasp, had to have some help to even reach the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia, who beat Norman in a playoff at the 1989 British Open, was 16 
under par with one hole to play. He bogeyed the 18th to give Norman a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson joined the playoff with a 12-foot birdie putt on the 18th that 
completed a 66. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Reid and Tom Purtzer tied for fifth at 275, two shots out of the playoff. 
Reid had a closing 70, Purtzer 68. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Daniel birdied the final two holes to win the Women's Kemper Open in 
Wailea, Hawaii, her second consecutive tournament victory. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Davies of Great Britain missed an eagle attempt on the final hole which 
would have forced a playoff. She tied for second with Rosie Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel shot two-under-par 69 on the Wailea Blue Course to complete a 
seven-stroke comeback over the final two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel, who won $75,000, finished the 72-hole tournament at 283.

GOLF SENIORS AT INDIAN WELLS;

TREVINO SPUTTERS, BUT HOLDS ON TO WIN

<TEXT>
<P>
Lee Trevino won his third Senior PGA tournament in the last four weeks Sunday 
at the Vintage Club, but it definitely was no breeze. 
</P>
<P>
The magic putter that contributed to 11 consecutive sub-par rounds was just 
another putter in the final 18 holes of the 54-hole Chrysler Vintage 
Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
By sinking an 18-inch putt on the last hole, Trevino posted a par 72 and a 205 
total. When Don Massengale missed a 12-foot birdie try on the 18th, Trevino 
just needed to get down in two from the fringe -- about 12 feet -- and he did. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino went into the final round with a three-shot lead, but finished only a 
stroke ahead of Massengale, Dale Douglass (67 on the final round), and Mike 
Hill (66). He earned $60,000 to increase his yearly total to $220,000. When he 
broke in on the regular tour it would have taken a dozen victories to earn that 
much. 
</P>
<P>
Before becoming eligible for the 50 and over tour, Trevino said he expected to 
win four or five tournaments in his first year. The goal is practically a 
cinch. But calling his shot has made him cautious and he won't make any 
predictions. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in a decade, Trevino has played competitively for seven 
weeks in a row. He started on the desert (the Bob Hope) and finished on the 
desert. He conceded it was almost a day too long. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired," he said. "It's a good thing I'm taking the next two weeks off. I 
wouldn't have won this tournament if I had had three or four players close 
going into the final round instead of just Don. 
</P>
<P>
"I went out there trying for another round of four or five under, but my 
putting, which was so good the first two days, wasn't today. If I had putted as 
well today, it would have been over by the 11th. Instead, it was a struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Trevino's lead was four strokes when Massengale three-putted No. 1. But by the 
seventh hole, it was even. Trevino missed putts of three feet, two of eight 
feet and another of six feet. Massengale sank birdie putts of eight feet on No. 
2, seven feet on No. 3 and eight feet on No. 7 to pull even. 
</P>
<P>
They remained even until the 11th when the wind, which was missing the first 
two days, finally showed up. The 11th is a 185-yard par 3 with water on the 
right. There was a cross win blowing to the left. After Massengale hit a 
seven-iron to the left in the high grass, Trevino hit a six-iron right at the 
pin. He was three feet to the right of the pin. 
</P>
<P>
The complexion changed when Massengale chipped to within four feet, but blew 
the putt. Trevino made his only birdie and the two-shot swing was just enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't even sure I could make that one," Trevino said. "Until today I 
thought every putt would go in." 
</P>
<P>
Massengale also missed an eight-footer at 13, but he blamed his driving, not 
his putting. 
</P>
<P>
"My driving was so erratic, I couldn't be aggressive," he said. "I spent the 
day trying for miracles." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hill and Douglass, the winner here in 1986, made late charges, but they 
knew they didn't have a chance when Trevino needed only a par on the 18th, a 
par 5 easy birdie hole. 
</P>
<P>
"Lee has won three tournaments, but all have been by just one shot," said 
Douglass, who lives in Phoenix and plays his best golf in California. "He is a 
great asset to our tour, but we are showing we can play with him. This is the 
best I've played this year. I'm ready for San Antonio." 
</P>
<P>
There will not be Trevino to contend with at San Antonio in two weeks. He will 
be resting. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that Trevino will cause many of the seniors to rethink their 
preparations for tournaments. Traditionally, during a tournament, players will 
practice for more than an hour before tee-off time and another hour or so after 
the round. Not Trevino. 
</P>
<P>
"I do my practicing when I'm home and not playing," he said. "I usually go out 
on the course half an hour before my starting time. I will putt just a few, 
merely to get the feel of the putter. Then, I will hit a bucket of balls. I 
don't practice after the round either. I go straight home and chase my daughter 
(Olivia, age 1) and my wife (Claudia, 32 in May) around the house. I can't 
catch either one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Trevino will play in a non-tour event in Japan late in March, then return to 
the tour in the Tradition at Scottsdale. There he will renew his rivalry with 
Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always great to go head-to-head with Jack," Trevino said. "He brings out 
the best in me. I know he'll be ready. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he made the remark about marginal players winning over here just to 
stir things up. He loves a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Each year the Vintage honors a golfer for his contributions to the sport. The 
1990 recipient is Gene Littler. Littler, who won the first Vintage in 1981 and 
also won in 1983, joins players such as Byron Nelson, Sam Snead and Arnold 
Palmer. . . . George Archer, who won 12 tournaments on the regular tour despite 
numerous physical problems, and his first on the senior tour after becoming 
eligible on Oct. 1, is having back problems again. He will go to Centinela 
Hospital today for an evaluation after finishing far behind with a 214. 
</P>
<P>
Until this year the revenue came mainly from the amateurs, 200 of them who pay 
$5,000 for a chance to play four rounds, two of them with senior pros, and, the 
sponsor. That has changed with the record crowds. . . . The crowd Sunday was 
even bigger than Saturday's. Most of the crowd followed and cheered Lee 
Trevino. On the senior tour there is now a Lee's Legion to go with Arnie's 
Army. . . . For the tournament there were 35 of the 54 golfers under par.

ELLERBEE DOESN'T MINCE WORDS WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN IN MEDIA

<TEXT>
<P>
If there is a "bottom line" to her speech tonight at San Diego State University 
about the role of women in the media, Linda Ellerbee says it is this: "We 
haven't come a long way, and we're not babies." 
</P>
<P>
The position of women in the networks has improved little over recent years, 
said Ellerbee, whose 7 p.m. talk at SDSU's Aztec Center will open a four-part 
series titled "How the Media Shape Our Lives." Admission is $10; $48 for the 
series. (There are different prices for each event.) 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see substantially more women at the networks," Ellerbee said. "I have 
yet to see a woman president of a news division. That's where the power is, not 
on the air." 
</P>
<P>
The wry columnist/commentator/author was speaking from the New York office of 
her production company, Lucky Duck Productions, where she had spent the 
afternoon fielding calls about recently reinstated CBS commentator Andy Rooney. 
Not surprisingly, Ellerbee had an opinion on the topic. 
</P>
<P>
"Networks seem to lose their courage a lot lately," said Ellerbee, something of 
an expert on the subject. "I was bothered that they took the word of somebody 
who has been in the business only a few months over (Rooney's)." 
</P>
<P>
Ellerbee spent 12 years working in network television news, butting heads with 
a system that often seems only marginally receptive to women newscasters in 
general and downright annoyed by dynamic, sarcastic women such as Ellerbee. She 
spent 11 years working with NBC News, anchoring and writing the news magazine 
"Weekend," in addition to documentaries and a regular feature series on the 
"Today Show." 
</P>
<P>
Her zenith at NBC was the critically acclaimed late-night news program "NBC 
News Overnight." Ellerbee became a friendly and familiar tonic for viewers, 
wrapping up the day's events with her now familiar sign off, "And so it goes." 
A stylized, quirky program, "Overnight" was cited by the Columbia duPont Awards 
as "possibly the best written and most intelligent news program ever." 
</P>
<P>
Undeterred by such lavish praise, NBC unceremoniously canceled the show, citing 
its small (but loyal) audience, providing Ellerbee with a harsh lesson. If she 
wasn't clear about the thinking process of the networks after "Overnight," it 
became crystal clear in 1986, when she left NBC to write and co-host "Our 
World" on ABC, an insightful and witty look at history. 
</P>
<P>
Ellerbee won an Emmy for her writing on "Our World." But the network scheduled 
the show opposite "The Cosby Show," and then canceled it because of low 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the consequence of a larger problem when 12-million viewers are not 
enough" to keep a show alive, Ellerbee said. 
</P>
<P>
She left network television after the demise of "Our World," taking a 
well-targeted parting shot with the publication of her autobiographical book, 
"And So It Goes." Revealing the quirks and humorous contradictions of the 
industry, "And So It Goes" spent 18 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list 
and sold more than 500,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
But she holds no bitterness toward the networks. 
</P>
<P>
"I had time to learn the craft on their dime," she said. "I had one of the 
world's best Walter Mitty jobs. That's a debt I can never repay." 
</P>
<P>
Mention Ellerbee these days and there likely will be a two-pronged response. 
The first often refers to a commercial she did for a coffee company with "Today 
Show" funny man Willard Scott, which boosted her recognition factor while 
damaging her reputation among some critics. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not one of the proudest moments in my life," Ellerbee said. "I did it 
simply for money to help my company, which is now doing fine. Under the same 
circumstances, I'd probably do it again." 
</P>
<P>
After mentioning the coffee commercial, people often question what Ellerbee is 
doing these days. The answer: quite a bit, thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>
She writes a syndicated newspaper column, in addition to regular pieces for 
several national publications, including the new magazine "Egg." Her Lucky Duck 
Productions, which she co-founded with Rolfe Tessem, recently completed its 
first production for television, "A Moveable Feast," a look at American food 
for the PBS series "Smithsonian World." 
</P>

Lucky Duck is working on another project for "Smithsonian World." Other 
projects in development include a humorous look at news programs and a 
documentary on American humor. Reuven Frank, who twice served as president of 
NBC News, recently joined Lucky Duck as a consulting producer.

<P>
Does she miss the immediacy and quirks of network news? 
</P>
<P>
"I miss the research library," she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, she said, she missed the excitement of covering breaking news 
stories, such as the events in China. But she realized there was nothing 
stopping her from being in the thick of things, thanks to her column and 
writing outlets. When the Berlin Wall story began to break, she got on a plane 
and flew to Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly one aspect of network news she doesn't miss is its often-thankless 
treatment of women, which she will explore in depth in her talk tonight at 
SDSU's Aztec Center. 
</P>
<P>
Although the position of some women in the industry has improved in "quick 
jumps," such as the recent advancement of Paula Zahn in ABC, "you don't see 
women covering the big beats," she said, nor are they being regularly promoted 
to executive positions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the right thing to do, to not have sex be an issue," she said. 
</P>
<P>
When a woman does achieve some fame and success at the network level, it is 
almost invariably as a "sidekick" teamed with a man, she pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
When she was hired for "Our World," Ellerbee said she demanded top billing as a 
negotiating ploy, hoping to get at least equal billing with co-host Ray 
Gandolf. Based on salary, experience and her position as head writer, she 
thought she deserved top billing. 
</P>
<P>
She was shocked when ABC actually gave it to her, citing all the reasons she 
had listed. 
</P>
<P>
"Then ABC went to Gandolf and said it was done alphabetically," she said, 
laughing at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
Her advice to women entering the industry is typically to the point. 
</P>
<P>
"Make sure you learn the craft," she said. "Really learn it, everything -- 
writing, shooting, editing, everything. If you rely only on looks and your 
ability to read a TelePrompTer, one day somebody will come along who doesn't 
like your looks and you'll be gone."

DIPLOMACY: THE SOVIET UNION SAYS BROADCASTS WITH AZERBAIJANI NATIONALISTS 'SET

COMPLAINTS.

At the height of the recent anti-Armenian riots in the southern Soviet republic 
of Azerbaijan, two radio stations financed by the U.S. government were 
broadcasting a virtual call to arms by Azerbaijani nationalists, the Soviet 
Union has complained to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials have charged that the broadcasts further inflamed passions in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of highly emotional interviews with Radio Liberty, Azerbaijani 
nationalists called for popular resistance to Soviet forces sent to quell the 
violence, in which 72 people, most of them Armenians, were killed in 
mid-January, according to transcripts of the broadcasts provided by Soviet 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Azerbaijani Popular Front, the principal nationalist movement in 
the republic, and the allied Azerbaijani National Defense Council went so far 
in Radio Liberty's Azeri-language broadcasts as to allege that the Soviet 
Communist Party had carried out anti-Armenian pogroms to justify a crackdown on 
Azerbaijani nationalism. Such nationalism has grown rapidly over the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The party had even organized a special squad to kill Armenian grandmothers so 
that there would be an excuse to bring troops into Baku, the Azerbaijani 
capital, one activist asserted on Radio Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview broadcast on the Voice of America's Azeri-language service, 
another prominent activist, rejecting the central government's opposition to 
the formation of the armed militias by Azerbaijani nationalists, asserted that 
their units were necessary to defend his people against Armenian attacks. 
</P>
<P>
As the crisis grew through January, Radio Liberty's Azeri-language service 
carried dozens of other interviews with Azerbaijani activists that senior 
Soviet officials believe, in the words of one, "set one nationality against 
another . . . provoking internal strife and escalating conflicts, and we 
believe deliberately so." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet government, in objecting recently to the U.S. State Department about 
these and other broadcasts on the two American stations, made it clear that its 
basic complaint was that militant nationalists were being given a radio 
platform to whip up passions at a time when Moscow was trying to prevent 
further bloodshed and restore order in the region. 
</P>
<P>
In the transcripts provided by Soviet officials, the Azerbaijani activists 
frequently gave dramatic but unverified accounts of clashes, either with 
Armenians or the Soviet army, that in the atmosphere of the crisis could have 
brought revenge attacks. Some accused the Soviet troops of committing 
atrocities in Baku. Others called for Azerbaijan's secession from the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine how outraged Americans would be if, God forbid, there were 
again race riots in Watts or Harlem or Washington and radio stations put people 
on the air saying in interviews that the police were shooting children on the 
street or hiding hundreds of bodies of people they killed?" a senior Soviet 
official asked. 
</P>
<P>
"But now try to imagine that these interviews were broadcast by a foreign 
government, which has two radio stations that have a wide audience in the areas 
where people are being killed, and you would have to question the motives of 
those involved," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Voice of America, which is a branch of the U.S. Information Agency, 
and Radio Liberty, which is financed by the U.S. government but operated 
independently, defended their Azeri-language broadcasts, including the 
interviews cited by Soviet officials. 
</P>
<P>
Iain Elliot, acting director of Radio Liberty, which broadcasts to the Soviet 
Union from Munich, called the complaint "an attempt of Soviet authorities to 
extend their censorship to Western media." 
</P>
<P>
Elliot said the interviews cited by Soviet officials were "very selective," 
coming from a mass of material broadcast by the Azeri-language service five 
hours a day, seven days a week, and that the official Soviet criticism was 
intended to inhibit Radio Liberty and other Western stations from broadcasting 
material not cleared by Soviet censors. 
</P>
<P>
"Those broadcasts were greatly appreciated by the Azerbaijani people," Elliot 
said by telephone from Radio Liberty's headquarters in Munich. He recalled that 
at the time, local newspapers were not publishing in Baku, that the television 
station had been damaged and that the Soviet army had taken over the radio 
station. 
</P>
<P>
"For many," he said, "their only source of information in those days was Radio 
Liberty." 
</P>
<P>
Gerd von Doemming, head of VOA's Soviet division, said that an interview with 
Mekhti Mamedov, a historian active in the Azerbaijani Popular Front, which had 
been questioned by Soviet officials, had taken up about 10 minutes of VOA's 
hourlong Azeri broadcast. It had followed a lengthy newscast, a survey of 
American and international comments about the ethnic violence in Armenia and 
Azerbaijan and considerable criticism of the Azerbaijani Popular Front, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I could make an argument about why this particular segment perhaps should not 
have been broadcast," Von Doemming said by telephone from Washington, "but I 
empathize with (the producer) because a genuine effort was made to provide a 
spectrum of opinion and include a balance of views, including that of the 
Azerbaijani Popular Front. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We have nonetheless reviewed the program in terms of our guidelines and basic 
philosophy, and we have had serious discussions about it. . . . It is our 
effort not to aggravate hostilities where there is bloodshed." 
</P>
<P>
At the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, a spokesman described the Soviet complaints as 
"serious matters . . . requiring an investigation and a response." He said they 
had been relayed to VOA and to the U.S. Board for International Broadcasting, 
which supervises Radio Liberty, and that preliminary replies affirming the 
radio stations' "commitments to traditions of objectivity and responsibility," 
had been sent to the Soviet government. 
</P>
<P>
With their broadcasts no longer jammed, Radio Liberty and Voice of America have 
large and apparently still-growing audiences in the Soviet Union because of the 
wide range of uncensored news they present and their ability to focus on major 
Soviet events, such as the conflict in Armenia and Azerbaijan, in ways that the 
Soviet news media, though freed from many past constraints, still cannot. 
</P>
<P>
"During this crisis, we spoke to all segments of the Baku community, and we 
aired all their views," said Mirza Khazar of Radio Liberty's Azeri service. "I 
had more than 700 telephone interviews from Baku, and we used only 20% of them, 
those we were sure of or that we could double- and triple-check. I am confident 
of the accuracy of the material we broadcast." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Radio Liberty's Elliot acknowledged that some of the material cited by 
Soviet officials, when read "in the cold light of day," might have been 
withheld for further verification or to avoid aggravating a tense, often 
dangerous situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We are obligated to check information out, but we are also obligated to let 
people on the spot speak out," Elliot said. "That's why we call this segment of 
the broadcast 'Voices of Azerbaijan.' " 
</P>
<P>
In one of the criticized interviews, broadcast by Radio Liberty the afternoon 
following the entry of Soviet troops into Baku, an activist accused Soviet 
troops of atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
"This is worse than genocide," the activist declared as crowds gathered around 
the Communist Party headquarters in central Baku to protest the military 
intervention, according to a transcript of the Jan. 20 broadcast. "They want to 
destroy the Azerbaijani people. They gouge out the eyes of the dead people and 
behead those whom they killed. They refused to let through ambulances, even to 
pick up corpses. Something really horrible is happening." 
</P>
<P>
One activist, Neimat Panakhov, accused Moscow in a Jan. 18 interview with Radio 
Liberty of preparing these events "according to a special scenario. They 
themselves staged the provocation. They have special people who perpetrate the 
provocations, but they cannot be caught red-handed." 
</P>
<P>
The VOA, broadcasting an interview with Mamedov on Jan. 17, characterized the 
Soviet government's position as "anti-Azerbaijani." In that broadcast, Mamedov 
issued a virtual call to arms and praised the establishment of an Azerbaijani 
militia to defend Azerbaijani villages against what he described as increasing 
attacks by Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
Other Radio Liberty broadcasts through the height of the crisis carried 
interviews reporting that Armenian helicopters were firing on Azerbaijani 
villages; that Armenian militias had been equipped with U.S. Stinger 
ground-to-air missiles, Italian land mines and other Western weapons, and that 
Azerbaijani villages along the Armenian border were under attack.

THE DANGEROUS TRUTH IN 'CHAD' 
</P>

<P>
Though the pen may be mightier than the sword, sometimes they work in 
conjunction with each other. One word, casually inserted into a foreign 
correspondent's story, can kill. 
</P>
<P>
Neal Bateman (Jim Phipps), a wire service stringer who has just been expelled 
from Uganda, is afraid that one of his words has -- ever so indirectly -- 
slaughtered an entire village. 
</P>
<P>
In "Rebel Armies Deep Into Chad," at the Old Globe's Cassius Carter Centre 
Stage, playwright Mark Lee amplifies Neal's anxiety into an examination of the 
importance, the difficulty and the danger of truth-telling. 
</P>
<P>
It's an evergreen subject for playwrights, but Lee's specifics are fairly 
fresh, and he handles his chosen themes with considerable agility. This play is 
likely to get a buzz going in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not as likely to set the heart pumping. Neal's story is told -- or 
revealed -- in retrospect, after he has been expelled from Uganda, in the 
relative safety of the home (lots of barbed wire and beer bottles, designed by 
Kent Dorsey) of the wire service's Nairobi correspondent (Richard Kneeland). A 
Ugandan refugee, Christina (Cheryl Francis Harrington), hired by the 
correspondent as a prostitute for Neal, is the character who gets him to 
divulge what happened. 
</P>
<P>
For a moment, when Christina recalls her own reason for leaving Uganda and then 
realizes the potential peril of being seen with Neal, we begin to feel the heat 
of the situation. Harrington has the presence and the inner fire to make the 
most of this moment. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, though, this is a reflective play, an inquiry into events of the 
recent past -- events that are not re-enacted on stage. 
</P>
<P>
As such, an undue burden is placed on the actor playing Neal to carry us along 
on Neal's mental journey -- or at least so it appears in Adrian Hall's staging. 
Actor Phipps has mastered Neal's nervous demeanor -- the correspondent 
describes him as a gazelle -- but he hasn't visibly opened himself up to the 
fuller dimensions of the role. We don't see him progressively inching closer to 
the truth, or finally acknowledging it in his gut. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Lee has written a couple of lines for Neal that simply don't ring true; 
would this gun-shy young man really ask two prostitutes to chant "om" in order 
to give him the time to say something to his host? Well, maybe so; Lee was 
there -- he was himself a wire service stringer expelled from Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
To a lesser extent, the play also follows the older correspondent's journey 
from being the completely detached observer into acceptance of his own share of 
responsibility for what happened. But while Lee paints the first part of this 
journey almost to excess, establishing this man as an observer and interrogator 
-- and loner -- of the first order, his eventual acceptance of responsibility 
feels like an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Kneeland has a convincingly scruffy, devil-may-care air about him, 
marred only by occasional swallowed lines, sacrificed to the dictates of 
arena-style blocking (the blocking is also a problem for the "freeze frame" 
that ends the first act; those of us on one side of the theater literally 
couldn't see it). 
</P>
<P>
The correspondent's jaded sensibility is shared by the older of the two 
prostitutes, well portrayed by Rose Weaver. Lee has drawn interesting 
generational parallels here between two very different classes of people. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Lee's points is that the editors of Western publications aren't very 
interested in Africa and the daily events there -- unless it can be dressed up 
in highly dramatic imagery or in thumb-sucking pieces about "the big picture." 
Neal began his job with fantasies of writing dispatches under sweeping 
headlines like "Rebel Armies Deep Into Chad," but he has found that the reality 
is more complicated -- involving many little murders instead of massive 
military ventures -- and that not many of his editors care about such things. 
</P>
<P>
So it's ironic that Lee's play really isn't about the many little murders among 
Africans either; it's about the ethical quandaries faced by Western journalists 
within Africa. Of course that's probably what Lee felt most qualified to write 
about. Still, it's as if he assumed that the people who select plays, even at 
enlightened theaters like the Old Globe, would be no more interested than 
Neal's editors if he focused on the Ugandans rather than the Westerners. 
</P>
<P>
This assumption may be incorrect. At least in this production, when Christina 
recounts what happened to her in Uganda, it's more gripping than anything that 
Neal has to say. Neal's story is important -- this play is essential viewing 
for journalists. But like the correspondent in the play who missed an 
assassination because he was busy with his own affairs, Lee may have missed the 
best story in Uganda.

'Quality' Viewers, Nielsen Disagree: A recent national survey of 3,500 members 
of a Virginia-based group seeking higher-quality TV fare greatly differed from 
the A. C. Nielsen Co. ratings. The Viewers for Quality Television Inc. survey 
respondents ranked the CBS Monday-night series "Murphy Brown" No. 1 and 
"Designing Women" as No. 2 on their most-watched list. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the latest Nielsen weeklies put those shows in a tie for 31st place. 
Further, while the Nielsens perennially place NBC's "The Cosby Show" in first 
place, the show did not even make the VQT's Top 25. The VQT members' Top 10 
were: "Murphy Brown," "Designing Women," "Roseanne," "L.A. Law," "Beauty and 
the Beast" (now canceled), "Newhart," "Cheers," "The Wonder Years," "The Golden 
Girls" and "In the Heat of the Night." SHAUNA SNOW

Channel One Debuts: Channel One, a news show with advertisements aimed at 
teen-agers, debuts today in 400 schools across the country amid an uproar over 
whether the two minutes of commercials included in each 12-minute show corrupts 
the school day. 
</P>
<P>
Several national education groups are opposing Channel One and officials in 
California and New York have prohibited public schools in those states from 
carrying the program. In addition, North Carolina has asked a state court to 
enforce its board of education's ban on the program. Channel One maintains that 
the commercials are essential because the $150,000 charge for each 30-second 
commercial pays for the $150 million in video equipment loaned to schools that 
show the program. SHAUNA SNOW

Los Angeles-based Danza Floricanto/USA celebrated its 15th year of Mexican 
folklorico performances with speeches, a round of "Mananitas" and "Happy 
Birthday" and a gift to the audience at the San Gabriel Civic Auditorium on 
Friday night of a delightful new suite of dances from the state of Nayarit. 
</P>
<P>
Artistic director Gema Sandoval's "Potorricos Nayaritas" deftly mixed tender 
gallantry and good-natured bravado as bare-chested men courted women in 
tropically brilliant tiered skirts and beribboned blouses, the men's stamping, 
machete-tossing bravado contrasting the women's sweeping half-moon turns and 
flirtatious fans. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble radiated a freedom and fullness of movement conspicuously absent 
in the evening's other premiere, "El Acabo Colimote," also by Sandoval. Here, 
harvest festivities and courtship rituals found the women stiff and tentative, 
and the men, graceful and confident early on, began to fall apart in passages 
of fast footwork punctuated by more flashing and clattering machetes. 
</P>
<P>
Musical interludes and accompaniment were splendid. Mariachi Mexicapan 
accompanied most of the dancing with exuberant musicality and polished 
professionalism. Conjunto Jarocho Hueyapan provided delicate, vigorous 
accompaniment for the company's meticulous, joyous "Fandango Veracruzano." 
Familiar works completed the program. SHELLEY BAUMSTEN WAGERS

TOKYO ENSEMBLE OPENS 1990 CALARTS FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Tokyo International Music Ensemble is an ad hoc group created for its 
current tour, but Toshi Ichiyanagi and his band of versatile virtuosos would be 
most welcome as a regular association. Their "New Tradition" program of gendai 
hogaku that opened the 1990 Contemporary Music Festival at CalArts Friday was a 
revelation. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most startling thing about this set of contemporary pieces for 
traditional Japanese gagaku instruments was the complete freedom from 
trivializing stereotypes. The instruments and their performance practices were 
honored, but within a reconceived context. 
</P>
<P>
The results were at once conceptually familiar and sonically fresh. 
Ichiyanagi's "Michi" (The Way) employed almost the entire ensemble of 
woodwinds, plucked strings and percussion in a large, formally rounded work 
that merged ceremonial solidity with emotional abstraction. 
</P>
<P>
At the climax of the piece, dancer Yoshiko Suzuki became the eye of the storm, 
a balanced, ultimately overwhelmed center of poise amid musical mayhem. The 
mixture of instruments with traditional dance and mime was unorthodox, 
expressively vehement and sonically kaleidoscopic. 
</P>
<P>
One of the distinctive elements of gagaku music is the piercing harmonic 
clusters of the shoh, a type of mouth organ. This instrument gave an exotic 
background flair to most of the pieces on the program, but took a central role 
in Toshio Hosokawa's "Utsuroi" (Transition). 
</P>
<P>
Mayumi Miyata made the musical form physical, circling with her shoh around 
harpist Ayako Shinozaki. The combination of the sustained tension from the shoh 
and the plangent agitations from the harp -- both delivered with controlled 
bravura -- proved a gripping ritual. 
</P>
<P>
Toru Takemitsu's "Distance" is a more conventionally patterned duo for oboe and 
shoh, fluently played by veteran avant-gardist James Ostryniec and Miyata. 
</P>
<P>
The other work for large ensemble on the program was Yoshiro Kanno's "Festival 
of Stone Mirror II." It offered brilliant opportunities for koto player Kazue 
Sawai in a flamboyant soundscape ordered by regular metric groupings. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, the woodwind ensemble "Hiten-seido I" by Maki Ishii is a soaring, 
quasi-countrapuntal reflection of John Cage's placidly mournful "Ryoanji." As 
usual, the presentation was communicative and as attentive to the total 
sight-sound performance environment as possible in the user-hostile Main 
Gallery. JOHN HENKEN

DRUCKMAN LEADS LACO IN PREMIERE OF HIS WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three orchestras participated in the commissioning of Jacob Druckman's "Nor 
Spell Nor Charm" but it was the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra that had the 
honor of giving the work its premiere performance Friday at the Wiltern Theatre 
(repeated at Ambassador Auditorium on Saturday). 
</P>
<P>
The 15-minute work, "an extension and elaboration" of a song Druckman had 
written a year ago for the late Jan DeGaetani, is an eloquently shaped, 
gradually unfolding rhapsody in which constantly varying changes in texture and 
timbre substitute for thematic and rhythmic activity. 
</P>
<P>
It unfolds with remarkable fluidity; "Nor Spell Nor Charm" is free of the 
abrupt transitions that plague much contemporary music. 
</P>
<P>
It is not free, alas, of many of the cliches that post-serial composers have 
been employing for the past 30 years: siren-like glissandos, static clusters in 
the strings and high woodwinds (interrupted by persistent barks from the brass 
or bassoons), pointillistic bleeps and pyramidal chords. 
</P>
<P>
As conducted by the composer, the orchestra executed the work with impressive 
elan. 
</P>
<P>
Following intermission, Norwegian cellist Truls Mork delivered a highly 
expressive, poignantly phrased reading of Tchaikovsky's "Rococo" Variations. 
Filled with passion, boldness and expressive power, his playing proved 
uncommonly moving, utterly absorbing. Led from the concertmaster's chair by 
Iona Brown, the orchestra provided effective support. 
</P>
<P>
The concert, which began with a neat and spritely account of a Haydn Notturno, 
ended with that composer's popular "Farewell" Symphony. Brown &amp; Co. brought 
considerable exuberance and vitality to the rapid passages, grace and 
refinement to the lyrical ones, and the 30-odd musicians carried off the 
farewell with charm and good humor.TERRY McQUILKIN

SANDERLING BEGINS BRAHMS SURVEY AT PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aimez-vous Brahms? If so, you are not alone. And, over the weekend, at concerts 
of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music 
Center, you would have found sustenance. 
</P>
<P>
Returning after an absence, Kurt Sanderling, for half a decade a popular guest 
conductor on the Philharmonic podium, offered the first in a series of three 
Brahms programs. The first, heard Friday night, consisted of the D-minor Piano 
Concerto, with Peter Roesel as soloist, and the First Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderling, still vivacious at age 77, has treated Los Angeles to his Brahms 
First before. In April, 1986, Martin Bernheimer described the Prussian-born 
conductor's reading of the work "remarkable for breadth, warmth and majesty." 
Nearly four years later, that description still fits. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the warmth has cooled a bit; Sanderling's approach to Brahms' structure 
seems to favor analysis over spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
But logic and continuity make the conductor's account -- the musical view more 
of an elder statesman rather than a young Turk -- eminently cherishable. In 
this view, for instance, the opening movement deals less in conflict, more in 
resolution. On Friday, the Philharmonic players cooperated wholeheartedly in 
bringing it to life -- though without achieving the utmost in integrated sound 
or rounded, post-Romantic textures. 
</P>
<P>
Roesel's letter-perfect, lean-sounding account of the First Piano Concerto also 
proved unconventional. Its musical perspective obviously was emanating from the 
podium, where Sanderling held the reins, and it eschewed heroics, individual 
statement and easy emotional release. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Roesel's dissected performance made the solo part more an obbligato 
line than the genuine protagonist of the piece. This became interesting on 
several levels, but least interesting pianistically, since Roesel often treats 
the instrument as a member of the percussion section, and not as a voice 
capable of legato or cantante.

'ANNE' MINISERIES INSPIRE WEEKLY SERIES 'AVONLEA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Disney Channel's two Emmy Award-winning miniseries, "Anne of Green Gables" 
and "Anne of Avonlea," have spawned "Avonlea," a rewarding, hourlong weekly 
series for all ages, beginning tonight at 8. 
</P>
<P>
Based again on the books of Lucy Maud Montgomery, "Avonlea" is the story of 
privileged 10-year-old Sara Stanley, who must come to rustic Prince Edward 
Island to live with relatives when her widowed father encounters financial 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
She's unhappy at first, but spirited (naturally), and quickly becomes the 
ringleader of adventure and mischief among the town's children, disarming and 
exasperating the adults at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
In the lead is wide-eyed, gap-toothed Sarah Polley, one of the most beguiling 
child actors around (her credits include "Ramona," the Canadian TV series based 
on the Beverly Cleary books, and Terry Gilliam's film, "The Adventures of Baron 
Munchausen"). She shares the small screen with a marvelous cast. Among the many 
actors playing unforgettable characters in the first three episodes are Jackie 
Burroughs (who plays Aunt "I'm just doing my duty" Hetty); Frances Hyland as 
Sara's prim nanny, horrified by the primitive town, and R.H. Thomson as a 
painfully shy, reclusive genius. 
</P>
<P>
Colleen Dewhurst and Patricia Hamilton are another plus, reprising their "Anne 
of Green Gables" roles as Marilla Cuthbert and Rachel Lynde. 
</P>
<P>
Executive producer Kevin Sullivan, who was the creative force behind the "Anne" 
miniseries, here offers family programming filled with warmth and charm and 
more: It's stunningly filmed, with the kind of expansive outdoor vistas and 
attention to authenticityrarely seen on weekly television. LYNNE HEFFLEY

POP CAPSULES: AFRO-ACID ROCK FROM TRIBE AFTER TRIBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Afro-acid rock" sounds like something Hugh Masekela might have experimented 
with in the late '60s, but actually it's the term the group Tribe After Tribe 
uses to define its style. Led by South African expatriate Robbi Robb, the Los 
Angeles-based power trio played the Shamrock on Friday as if the 
east-of-Hollywood neighborhood bar was the Forum, inspiring at least one 
onlooker to flick his Bic. 
</P>
<P>
Tribe's fiery, psychedelic punk assault burns closer to Jane's Addiction than 
township jive (though Robb did throw in a few Zulu kicks that should pose no 
immediate threat to Johnny Clegg). With Robb swinging his right arm like Pete 
Townshend's and wailing like a high-register Bono, this was a Tribe based more 
in standard power rock 'n' roll than Soweto soul. CRAIG LEE

POP CAPSULES: CULTURE'S ROOTS APPEAR MORE VEGAS THAN JAMAICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roots reggae is like 12-bar blues: The same elements are recycled with minimal 
variation, so it's often a thin line that separates material laden with genre 
cliches and music that powerfully evokes the best aspects of the tradition. 
Culture's last two albums both landed well on the positive side of that border, 
but the veteran vocal trio's hour-plus performance before a sparse crowd of 
1,000 at the Hollywood Palladium on Friday reached those heights only 
sporadically . 
</P>
<P>
At times, Culture seemed to be veering surprisingly close to roots Vegas 
culture. Lead singer Joseph Hill's blue cutaway jacket, silver sparkle tie and 
matching handkerchief spoofed show-biz glitz, but the arrangements were too 
techno-slick early in the set. Culture's finest moments came when it stripped 
the sheen away and achieved reggae's characteristic trance dance behind the 
mesmerizing harmonies of "Iron Sharpening Iron," "I'm Worried" and the 
Rasta/gospel hybrid "This Train." 
</P>
<P>
Second-billed Sugar Minott's effervescent work ethic was severely undercut by 
the local AKB backing band, whose plodding tempos on the slower songs weighted 
Minott down with a rhythmic anchor. DON SNOWDEN

POP CAPSULES: EXCEL: THE OTHER KIND OF LOS ANGELES METAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Excel is the best metal band you've never heard of, a bunch of Venice 
skate-dudes with crunchy riffs, tightly structured songs and politically 
charged lyrics whose alienation can remind you of great punk-rock. This is the 
other kind of Los Angeles metal, more akin to such former local bands as Slayer 
and Metallica than to the coiffured hard-rockers who throng the Sunset Strip. 
</P>
<P>
At the Country Club on Saturday, in front of a Venice wild-style graffiti 
mural, Excel played its first local show in ages. The sound was as clear as on 
both of its albums. The people in the slam pit chanted along to everything (the 
band didn't even bother shouting the choruses) and guys dove into the crowd 
both from the stage and from the tier of tables behind the pit. The club was 
hot enough to steam broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Excel's showmanship isn't up to its musicianship: In the five years it's 
been together, the band has only performed live a handful of times, and it 
shows. The interminable waits between songs all but destroyed the momentum of 
the set.JONATHAN GOLD

Seventy members and associates of three San Diego Crip gangs have been arrested 
in a yearlong undercover investigation aimed at street-level drug dealers, 
authorities said. "Operation Blue Rag," a federally funded operation targeting 
the gang members, swept a number of suspected drug traffickers from 
neighborhoods with notorious reputations as hangouts for crack cocaine dealing 
and other criminal activity, the San Diego County district attorney's office 
said. Eight of the suspects were arrested on federal charges but the majority 
were booked on state charges involving drug sales and possession of drugs and 
weapons.

A farm worker who died while spraying an almond orchard apparently swallowed 
some of the pesticide parathion, according to the Kern County coroner's office. 
An autopsy on Jose Campos Martinez, 25, revealed he had an "appreciable 
quantity" of the pesticide in his stomach, but not in his vital organs, 
indicating he must have swallowed the poison and not ingested it through his 
skin or nostrils. Campos, who lived in Wasco, fell dead in an orchard near Lost 
Hills on Jan. 20.

PORTABLE CLASSROOMS SNAG PLAN FOR SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: A LACK OF BUNGALOWS MAY ELIMINATE AN OPTION FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
THAT MAY FORCE ADOPTION OF THE MORE CONTROVERSIAL YEAR-ROUND SCHEDULE TO CREATE 
SPACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY BANKS, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months of protracted, often acrimonious debate, Los Angeles Unified 
School District board members last month thought they had finally wrestled the 
district's most intractable problem to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
By a narrow margin, board members voted to contain the overcrowding that has 
crippled the district by putting all 600 of its schools on a year-round 
schedule next year, and requiring each of them to accommodate 23% more 
students. 
</P>
<P>
But the plan has been snagged by tactical problems that the board must try to 
untangle today, when it decides how to implement its overcrowding relief plan 
in the 109 elementary schools that will be the first to increase their 
capacities this year. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, those schools were told they could choose from among three options 
to increase their seating capacity: They could put two more children in each 
class, add bungalow classrooms or convert to multi-track, year-round operation, 
which puts groups of students at a school on staggered attendance schedules 
that run throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
But the board also has voted to restrict those options by not allowing a school 
to use portable classrooms to push its enrollment beyond 1,000 students. That 
means, in effect, that 63 of those 109 schools may have no choice but to go to 
the multi-track, year-round plan, which many parents oppose as disruptive to 
families. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 25 other schools that would likely have opted for portable 
classrooms may be forced to go year-round instead because bungalows will not be 
available this year. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma of how to provide schools with as much choice as possible while 
fairly spreading the burden of relieving overcrowding has resurrected the deep 
divisions among school board members and alarmed parents, who thought the issue 
was settled with last month's vote. 
</P>
<P>
"You think you have options, then the next thing you hear is you really don't 
have a choice," said Cathy Fisher, a parent at Dixie Canyon Elementary School 
in Sherman Oaks. "It's all kind of confusing. I think lots of parents are just 
holding their breaths." 
</P>
<P>
Dixie Canyon is on the list to increase its capacity this year, and parents and 
teachers would very likely have chosen to increase class size and use bungalows 
when the vote is held on the options next month. 
</P>
<P>
But those bungalows would not arrive until July, 1991, and the school board is 
now locked in debate over whether schools like Dixie Canyon should be allowed 
to wait a year, until they get their bungalows, or be forced to use the only 
remaining option to increase capacity -- a multi-track, year-round schedule. 
</P>
<P>
To many parents who were counting on using bungalows to avoid going 
multi-track, year-round this year, the news that the board may not allow them 
the leeway to acquire the portable classrooms has been a disappointing blow. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to be optimistic, but a lot of parents are looking at private 
schools, just in case," Fisher said. "Our time is running out to make decisions 
for next semester, and we still don't know where we stand." 
</P>
<P>
District officials say it would cost between $7.5 million and $10 million to 
supply 100 portable classrooms to the schools expected to request them this 
year, and it would take up to 18 months to get the bungalows on campus because 
of the time-consuming state review process and the building alterations that 
would have to be made at some schools. 
</P>
<P>
The money would come from the district's $80-million developer fee account, 
which can only be used for portable classrooms or construction to relieve 
school overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of that money is already committed to school building projects, 
and some board members question whether it is wise to spend so much on portable 
classrooms in a district that desperately needs new schools and find it 
increasingly difficult to get the state to pick up the tab. 
</P>
<P>
And, finances aside, board representatives from some of the district's most 
crowded areas say they oppose allowing some schools to wait a year, calling 
that unfair to the 63 campuses that have no choice but to adopt multi-track 
year-round schedules because they are already too large or don't have enough 
playground space for portable classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pained by this whole idea that 63 schools have no choice," East Los 
Angeles board representative Leticia Quezada said at last week's board meeting. 
"If we're going to give 63 schools no choice because they have no space . . . 
that ought to apply to all 109 schools and not just to some." 
</P>
<P>
Quezada accused the district of being "tremendously accommodating" to those 
schools -- mostly on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley -- that want 
portable classrooms, and "patently unfair" to the most-overcrowded schools. 
</P>
<P>
And South-Central Los Angeles representative Rita Walters -- who voted against 
the year-round plan -- blasted her colleagues for leaving a "huge loophole" 
that could allow many schools to escape the capacity increase requirement this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Again, all the choices accrue to those people in those schools that are not 
overcrowded," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Walters has threatened to urge schools on the list in her district to refuse to 
adopt multi-track, year-round schedules if other schools that want -- but 
cannot get -- portable classrooms are not forced into multi-track operation 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
But district officials say allowing the schools that request portable 
classrooms to wait a year would not hamper the overcrowding relief plan, and a 
majority of the board seems inclined to agree to the delay when it votes at 
today's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
By waiting, the district would lose about 3,000 of the 21,000 seats the plan 
was expected to create at elementary schools this year, according to Gordon 
Wohlers, whose office devised the overcrowding relief plan. That would not pose 
a problem unless far more than the expected 11,000 new elementary students show 
up to enroll next fall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But some board members fear that letting certain schools on this year's list 
wait a year to generate more seats is likely to compound the problem of adding 
space next year, when another 100 schools must find ways to increase their 
capacities. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next three years, all the district's schools are mandated to increase 
space for students by 23%. Many of those schools will want to rely on portable 
classrooms to ease overcrowding rather than the more controversial multi-track, 
year-round schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The district generally spends between 10% and 15% of the more than $40 million 
it collects each year in developer fees on portable classrooms. That is far 
short of the $10 million or so it would take each year to keep up with the 
expected demand for the bungalows. 
</P>
<P>
Because money is so tight, the board is hard-pressed to find other ways to deal 
with the district's overcrowding crisis, which results in more than 20,000 
children being bused away from their neighborhood schools each day, at a cost 
of $2.8 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the board will examine another method of creating more seats when they 
vote on whether to consider relaxing the district's integration guidelines at 
126 schools that are more than one-third white, in order to find more space for 
minority students from overcrowded schools. 
</P>
<P>
Although the district's goal is to maintain integrated schools -- with no more 
than 60% minority enrollment -- its growing proportion of minority students and 
the need to find space for them outside their neighborhood schools have 
combined to force changes in those integration guidelines at most of the 
district's 600 schools. 
</P>
<P>
The changes to be proposed today would allow district staff to study whether 72 
magnet schools and 54 other schools that serve as receivers for children bused 
from overcrowded areas could accommodate up to 70% minority students without 
leading to segregation. 
</P>
<P>
Those schools are the only remaining campuses in the district that still adhere 
to the 60% minority limit. As the district has become more than 85% minority, 
schools have been studied and switched to the 70/30 integration ratio to 
accommodate growing minority enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
The changes would allow more minority students to attend magnet schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District has been struggling for years to find 
ways to accommodate its fast-growing enrollment. This month, public meetings 
will be held at elementary schools that must increase student capacity this 
year. In April, parents, teachers and staffs of those schools will vote on 
individual school plans to reduce overcrowding. Over the next three years, all 
district schools will follow this process to increase capacity.

SUSPECTS NAMED IN KILLING OF PREGNANT WOMAN IN HUNTINGTON PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Los Angeles teen-agers have been identified as suspects who allegedly 
terrorized six members of a Huntington Park family before killing a pregnant 
woman and her fetus and slashing the woman's mother with a knife, investigators 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities identified Glenford Brooks, 16, and Walter Steve Scott, 18, as the 
two armed men who broke into a condominium and shot Silvia Enriquez, 24, 
killing the woman and her 8-month fetus, Huntington Park Police Detective Tom 
Weselis said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, who have been linked to similar crimes in San Gabriel and Long 
Beach, are still at large and considered "armed and extremely dangerous," the 
detective said. 
</P>
<P>
He described Brooks as 5-feet-5 to 5-feet-7, weighing about 140 pounds and 
having a "noticeable overbite." 
</P>
<P>
The two are suspected of putting a family through a three-hour ordeal during a 
robbery of their home Feb. 26, repeatedly threatening them before killing 
Enriquez. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said the pair sneaked past a security gate and broke into the 
condominium on Oak Street, behind Huntington Park High School. 
</P>
<P>
There they found Jose and Guadalupe Licea; their son, Juan, 26; their pregnant 
daughter, Silvia; her husband, Alfredo Enriquez, and the couple's 22-month-old 
son. 
</P>
<P>
The intruders -- one armed with a handgun, the other with a knife -- demanded 
money and ransacked the home in search of valuables, investigators said. One 
ordered Juan Licea to blindfold and bind the other men and tie his mother's 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
As the intruder armed with a gun tried to force the pregnant Enriquez into a 
side room, the woman -- apparently believing she was about to be killed -- 
resisted and tried to wrest the gun away from her attacker, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
"The suspect then threw the pregnant woman to the ground and shot her," Weselis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman's accomplice slashed Guadalupe Licea across the face and head with a 
knife when she tried to go to her daughter's rescue, detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Licea escaped and ran to a neighbor's apartment to call for help. 
</P>
<P>
Enriquez and her fetus were dead when paramedics arrived. Guadalupe Licea was 
treated at a hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Huntington Park murder, the suspects are also believed 
responsible for a robbery, rape and kidnaping in San Gabriel and three 
robberies of homes in Long Beach, Weselis said. 
</P>
<P>
The key break in the cases came when the state automated fingerprint system 
identified fingerprints taken at one of the Long Beach robberies as belonging 
to Scott, the detective said. Witnesses to the Huntington Park murders then 
identified Scott from a photo, he said. Brooks, a known associate of Scott's, 
was also later identified from a photo, Weselis said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers from Huntington Park, San Gabriel, Long Beach and Los Angeles served 
search warrants at three locations in the Southland on Sunday and recovered 
property tying the suspects to the other robberies, Weselis said. 
</P>
<P>
Several weapons were turned up in the searches, including a .22-caliber rifle 
taken in the San Gabriel robbery, police said. But the .38-caliber revolver 
believed used in the Huntington Park murder was not recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Weselis said Scott and Brooks may be driving one of three cars: a gray, 
four-door 1988 Volvo 240 DL with California license 2HBU492; a two-door 1977 
Buick Regal with a white top and light blue body, California license 323WXF, or 
a two-door, red 1980 Toyota Corolla, California license 414ZLF.

DNA TEST CAN DETERMINE PATERNITY BEFORE BIRTH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The new technique of DNA fingerprinting, quickly becoming widely used in 
criminal court cases, can also be used to determine a child's paternity, even 
before birth, a USC obstetrician reported last week in the journal Obstetrics 
and Gynecology. 
</P>
<P>
In the technique, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid, the genetic blueprint of life) 
from blood or sperm cells is isolated and separated into groups of fragments to 
produce a unique visual "fingerprint" that makes it possible to determine 
whether two samples are from the same person or from related individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bruce Kovacs cited the case of a 34-year-old woman with a long history of 
infertility who was receiving drug treatment to induce ovulation. During the 
midpoint of one of her cycles, she was raped by an unknown assailant. On her 
next visit to her physician, she was found to be pregnant. DNA fingerprinting 
proved that her husband was the father. 
</P>
<P>
In a second case, a 35-year-old pregnant woman had been sexually active while 
estranged from her husband. She wanted to continue the pregnancy only if the 
fetus was her husband's. Unfortunately, Kovacs found, it was not.

HEALTH: SPECIALISTS OFFER A 'WORRY GUIDE' FOR THE 1990S AND OUTLINE WHAT PEOPLE 
CAN DO TO KEEP THEMSELVES WELL.

By CRISTINE RUSSELL, Russell is a former medical writer for the Washington 
Post, where this article first appeared.

"It is the safest of times, it is the riskiest of times . . . . What the 
dickens is going on here?" asked Michigan State University sociologist Denton 
Morrison in an essay titled "A Tale of Two Toxicities." 
</P>
<P>
The seeming contradiction is a "major technological paradox of our time," said 
Morrison, and it emerges from growing differences in the way experts and the 
public perceive risk. 
</P>
<P>
A recent National Academy of Sciences report, "Improving Risk Communication," 
cited Morrison's paradox as the "central dispute about technology and risk." 
Those who believe it is the safest of times point out that average life 
expectancy has risen at a time when the nation increased its use of chemicals 
and other hazardous substances. Those who view this as the riskiest of times 
say modern technology is generating new threats to society and the Earth's 
life-support systems at an accelerating pace. 
</P>
<P>
The academy report concluded that "the dispute cannot be resolved by available 
evidence. In fact, it may not be about evidence. At a deeper level, it is about 
what kinds of risks people want most to avoid, what kinds of lives they want to 
lead, what they believe the future will bring." 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s brought an array of highly publicized risk concerns: AIDS, 
second-hand cigarette smoke, the Soviet nuclear accident at Chernobyl, radon 
and indoor air pollution, medical-waste disposal, toxic waste dumps, 
cholesterol, Alar in apples, warnings about destruction of the Earth's ozone 
layer and concern about global warming. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge for the 1990s may be to decide what to worry about, which risks 
are acceptable and which are intolerable, whether they can be prevented and at 
what cost. 
</P>
<P>
"We worry so much we are almost afraid of our own shadows," said James O. 
Mason, assistant secretary for health in the Department of Health and Human 
Services. "Identify the risks that are really significant and do something 
about those." 
</P>
<P>
Here's a "worry guide" to the 1990s from some of the nation's top health 
experts: 
</P>
<P>
* Personal health habits. The cartoon character Pogo's dictum, "We have met the 
enemy and he is us," will continue to be painfully true in terms of personal 
health risks. 
</P>
<P>
A study for the Carter Center of Emory University in Atlanta estimated that two 
out of three deaths in this country and one out of three hospitalizations are 
linked to only six risk factors: tobacco, alcohol, injuries, high blood 
pressure, diet (too many calories, too much fat and cholesterol), and gaps in 
basic health care. 
</P>
<P>
"What I think will be most important in the 1990s will be a growing awareness 
of how many of the risks we bring on ourselves we in fact can control. I'm 
talking about tobacco, drinking and driving, drug use of all kinds, the way we 
eat, the way we live our lives in terms of stress and fitness," said Harvey V. 
Fineberg, dean of Harvard's School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
Changes in lifestyle are already credited with a dramatic decline in the 
nation's No. 1 killer, heart disease. "For people to worry about their health 
risks is an investment for their future," said Claude Lenfant, director of the 
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. "I cannot change how I am born, but I 
can change what I do in terms of blood pressure, smoking, general fitness, 
exercising, taking care of my body." 
</P>
<P>
For the No. 2 killer -- cancer -- "put smoking as a very high priority," said 
National Cancer Institute chief Samuel Broder. "We're losing ground in some 
areas, particularly adolescents and women. Smoking is also having a resurgence 
in underserved, poor populations." Health officials believe that about 
one-third of cancers are related to smoking. One-third are linked to dietary 
influences, probably high fat and low fiber. The other third are open for 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Risks also vary at different ages, with younger Americans most threatened by 
injuries -- from automobiles to handguns -- and new diseases like AIDS. At the 
other end of the spectrum, Americans are at risk of many chronic disabilities 
that make them unable to function on their own. 
</P>
<P>
* Environmental risk. There is less agreement on which environmental risks are 
most important. Many public-health experts feel the public's concern about 
chemicals and cancer is out of proportion to the actual risk. 
</P>
<P>
"Environmental and toxic agents need to be watched, but are not imposing the 
kind of health burden that the behavioral risks are," said Michael McGinnis, 
deputy assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, environmental scientists are moving toward the notion of acceptable 
risk. "Exposure to some environmental material might be capable of causing 
disease, but the likelihood could be vanishingly small," said Samuel Thier, 
head of the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine. "The fact that 
something has a finite risk doesn't mean that it is unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, an Environmental Protection Agency task force ranked pesticides, air 
pollution, radon and other indoor air pollution, tap water, consumer product 
exposure, worker exposure to chemicals and global warming at the higher end of 
environmental risks to health and ecology. But the public was more concerned 
about hazardous- or toxic-waste sites and chemical plant accidents, which 
ranked lower in the task force's view. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many scientists and consumer advocates are concerned that 
there have not been enough studies of the more subtle and long-term effects of 
exposure to chemicals. Lead poisoning from paint, drinking water and urban dust 
and soil that is now recognized as a cause of irreversible brain damage and 
other brain defects is one example. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always playing catch-up with chemicals in the environment. If I had one 
wish, it's that we really made a serious commitment to testing chemicals before 
we start using them," said Ellen Silbergeld, director of the Environmental 
Defense Fund's toxic chemicals program. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers are also recognizing that there are other important health effects 
besides cancer, such as risks to the nervous system, lungs, kidneys and fetus. 
"We've got to take into account real differences in susceptibility among 
individuals and learn to detect them," said Gilbert Omenn, dean of the 
University of Washington School of Public Health and Community Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
* Societal risk. Some of the most difficult health risks are posed by American 
society itself. The way the country educates its children, addresses the 
problems of inner-city poor and minority communities and provides health care 
are major social challenges for the coming decade. 
</P>
<P>
Public health is expanding to include problems like violence, poverty and 
education that go beyond medical care. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a whole lot of health effects related to social characteristics, 
like inadequate education, income, housing, transportation, welfare, 
retirement," said Alvin Tarlov, president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family 
Foundation. "I would say a buck spent on improving public school education 
probably would do more for health than a buck spent on medical care. The most 
powerful correlate of good or bad health is the level of education. There is a 
direct relationship between health and education as measured in infant 
mortality, maternal mortality, heart disease, substance abuse and adolescent 
pregnancy."

Heart-conscious eaters who are fed up with low-fat diets can safely add some 
olive oil and other monounsaturated fats to their daily fare, but the extra 
dose probably won't reduce their cholesterol, a study concludes. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have been searching for foods that prevent disease rather than cause 
it, and monounsaturated fat has been among the possible candidates. A study 
examining it was published in last week's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Some studies have suggested that foods high in monounsaturated fat, such as 
olive oil, actually might lower blood cholesterol levels. But the new work 
found that while monounsaturated fats don't raise cholesterol, they don't seem 
to lower it significantly.

A new step toward protection against the common cold has been taken by 
researchers at Boeringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Ridgefield, Conn. 
They reported in the journal Nature last week that they have discovered a way 
to trick rhinoviruses, which cause more than half of all colds, into not 
infecting cells in the nose. 
</P>
<P>
Their work relied on the discovery last year by two groups of researchers that 
the rhinoviruses bind to a specific receptor, called ICAM-1, on the external 
membrane of cells in the nasal passage. If the viruses do not bind to the 
receptor, they do not infect the cells. 
</P>
<P>
Molecular biologist Steven D. Marlin and his colleagues used genetic 
engineering techniques to make multiple copies of a form of ICAM-1 that could 
be dissolved in water. When they sprayed a solution of the receptors onto the 
surface of nasal cells grown in the laboratory, they found that the receptors 
tied up all the rhinoviruses to which the cells were subsequently exposed, 
thereby preventing infection. 
</P>
<P>
The next step will be to try the soluble ICAM-1 in living animals.

MIKE DOWNEY: ORTIZ DOESN'T RUN OUT OF TIME;

A NATION IS GIVEN LONG-DISTANCE LIFT

Coke and coffee, coffee and coke. Colombians understand that they are lumped 
with these exports. They know it and are leery of it, weary of it. They long to 
be known for producing more, be known for supplying the likes of Pedro Ortiz, 
champion of Sunday's Los Angeles Marathon, be known for growing more on 
Colombia's fertile soil than just rich and potentially life-endangering beans. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is told that Colombia is bad news," said Carlos Pilo Godoy, the La 
Crescenta businessman who coaches Ortiz. "Bad in this, bad in that, bad in 
this. Colombia is good in soccer, good in providing talented runners, tennis 
players, riders in equestrian events. And now, a Colombian is the winner of the 
1989 L.A. International Marathon. So please, put this in your headlines. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 34 million persons in Colombia. Not all of these 34 (million) are 
bad. Colombia has good, hard-working citizens. Colombia has good musicians, 
good salsa. It has the winner of the prize Nobel, Gabriel Garcia Marquez. And 
now it has this man, Pedro Ortiz. We would like to see you put big headlines 
that a Colombian has won the L.A. Marathon. Put very big headlines in your 
newspaper to tell everybody not all Colombians are bad news." 
</P>
<P>
Still wearing laurels hours after hitting the finish line, Pedro Ortiz nodded 
and agreed. Through his coach, he said he felt proud to win the race "for all 
my fellow Latinos here in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Californians had a right to be every bit as much in his corner as Colombians 
were. Maybe that's why they lined the avenues from Figueroa to Echo Park, from 
Hollywood to Vine, standing in the rain, cheering him along. Ortiz is a 
resident alien, a U.S. taxpayer with a driver's license who boarded with Godoy 
when he wasn't training for the last America's Marathon in Chicago, where he 
ran second, or for the last three L.A. races, or for the next New York 
Marathon, on which he has now set his sights. 
</P>
<P>
He has a support group here. As the L.A. Marathon president, Bill Burke, said: 
"Los Angeles is famous for people staying home when it rains. But I couldn't 
believe the numbers that were out there today, cheering for Pedro." 
</P>
<P>
As for Colombia's government or athletic federation, what sort of support is 
Ortiz given? 
</P>
<P>
"None," said Godoy. "Nada, nada and nada." 
</P>
<P>
Even when the two of them traveled back to the high altitudes of Bogota to 
train in the hills for four weeks, preparing for the Los Angeles race that 
meant so much to them, they wondered what sort of elevated stature, if any, 
Ortiz would attain if he ever came home a conquering hero. His coach bet 
Colombians would regret not taking more of an interest in him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are many people not sleeping very well there now," said Godoy. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Colombia has itself a worthy contender, it would appear, for the 
1991 world championships and 1992 Summer Olympics in Ortiz, who is in prime 
shape, a little on the muscular side, and at a prime age, 32, to be coming into 
his own as a world-class distance runner. Back in his hometown of Bucamanga, it 
is only now becoming clear what sort of possibilities await him. 
</P>
<P>
And, if it seemed as though Ortiz was running Sunday with a vengeance, perhaps 
he was. He and his coach resented it greatly in 1989 when they had to pay their 
travel and entry fees after placing 10th in the previous year's L.A. race. When 
Godoy telephoned, seeing the invitation that never came, he acknowledged 
telling the voice on the other end "in some very rude words" what he thought of 
this snub. 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz went out and ran second. In so doing, he missed out on the sort of 
opportunity that recently was afforded the champion of the Daytona 500 auto 
race, who took advantage of the late collapse of the leader. Ortiz was dawdling 
27 seconds behind Art Boileau of Canada when the pacesetter, Gidimas Shahanga 
of Tanzania, withered and withdrew. Had he stayed closer, Boileau might not 
have won. 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz said he decided to train this time to make up one second per mile, 27 
seconds over 26.2 miles, to get where he was going. 
</P>
<P>
To do so, he looked over his shoulder constantly, fought off every challenge, 
even used his elbows and hips if necessary to keep them at bay. Said 
third-place finisher Peter Fonseca of Canada: "Ortiz would get a little mad and 
give you a look or a bump and I'd go: 'Whoa, dude."' 
</P>
<P>
That's how badly Ortiz wanted to win. He wanted the money, the Mercedes, the 
memory that went along with winning. And mainly he wanted that headline: NOT 
ALL COLOMBIANS ARE BAD NEWS. Even for those who already know this, the time 
seems right for a reminder.

Hank Gathers, the West Coast Conference's all-time leading scorer and No. 11 on 
the NCAA's career scoring list, died Sunday after collapsing on the court 
during Loyola Marymount's game against Portland in the semifinals of the WCC 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death was not immediately known. However, officials did say 
Gathers had a cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers had given Loyola Marymount a 25-13 lead with a dunk moments before 
collapsing near midcourt. At 5:36 p.m. PST, Gathers was taken by ambulance to 
Marina Mercy Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Several minutes after Gathers was taken to the hospital, the WCC commissioner 
and executive board announced the game had been suspended indefinitely with 
13:34 left in the first half. Sunday night's other semifinal game, between 
Pepperdine and San Diego, was postponed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was necessary to postpone the games tonight because of not knowing 
the severity of Hank's condition," Portland Coach Larry Steele said. Steele 
said the Portland players were "very concerned, stunned, disbelieving." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers' mother and sister rushed out of the stands in front of a hushed crowd 
at Gersten Pavilion after the player collapsed. Gathers was carried off on a 
stretcher and CPR was administered. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time this season that the 6-foot-7, 210-pound senior from 
Philadelphia has fainted on his home court during a game. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 9 against Santa Barbara, Gathers went to the foul line with 13:56 left 
in the first half, missed his first free throw, stepped away from the foul line 
and collapsed. He underwent several days of tests in a local hospital and 
returned after missing two games. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers began taking medication to regulate his heartbeat. Doctors suspected 
that an accelerated heart beat might have led to the first collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers convinced the doctors to reduce his level of medication, after which he 
felt his body strength improving. In the first week of February, he scored 44 
points against St. Mary's.

MILLER REMAINS NONCHALANT AS OTHERS DREAM OF DERBY

<P>
Some of the nation's best horse trainers have spent this winter preoccupied by 
a single objective: developing a young racehorse into a contender for the 
Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Woody Stephens, Shug McGaughey and Scotty Schulhofer have been at Gulfstream 
Park every morning, scrutinizing every move by their top 3-year-olds. They have 
spent countless hours plotting training and racing schedules. Then, on Saturday 
afternoon, they all learned (or at least should have learned) the same sobering 
lesson. As hard as they might be trying, they aren't going to win the 1990 
Derby, because their horses aren't good enough. 
</P>
<P>
And, ironically, the one horse at Gulfstream who might be Kentucky Derby 
material -- Red Ransom -- probably won't win it either, because his trainer 
isn't really trying. 
</P>
<P>
The Fountain of Youth Stakes had drawn most of the big-name 3-year-olds in the 
East, and it figured to be a genuine test of their abilities. All of the horses 
had been prepped for a top effort. But McGaughey's champion colt Rhythm and 
Stephens's stretch-runner Yonder delivered abysmal performances. Schulhofer's 
colt Slavic was a mediocre sixth behind the 25-1 winner, Shot Gun Scott. 
</P>
<P>
The only 3-year-old who has raced notably well in stakes competition this year 
is Mister Frisky, the speedball from Puerto Rico who scored his 15th straight 
victory in the San Rafael Stakes at Santa Anita Saturday. But his stamina is 
suspect; the Kentucky Derby is up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
Red Ransom might have been the horse to seize this opportunity. He had shown 
such talent winning his only two starts as a 2-year-old that trainer Mack 
Miller announced that he was going to bring the colt to Florida and prepare him 
for the Triple Crown series. 
</P>
<P>
For anybody else this would not have been a surprising decision. But the 
68-year-old Miller traditionally spends the winter in Aiken, S.C., training his 
stable in a leisurely fashion; he says that for him, the racing season begins 
in August, at Saratoga, and ends in November. 
</P>
<P>
He managed his last good 3-year-old, Java Gold in 1987, consistent with this 
philosophy; he skipped the entire Triple Crown series, won some prestigious 
stakes in New York during the summer and early fall, and announced his 
intention to skip the Breeders' Cup because it was too late in the season, 
though an injury made this latter decision academic. 
</P>
<P>
Miller trains for an owner, Paul Mellon, who can afford to pass the richest 
races in the country, but they got enough criticism for their conservatism with 
Java Gold that Miller was willing to try something new with Red Ransom. 
</P>
<P>
Red Ransom came to Gulfstream, but without Miller; an assistant was in charge. 
Miller stayed in Aiken, as usual, and didn't even make an appearance at 
Gulfstream to look in on his putative superstar until a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a lesson to be learned from the history of the Kentucky Derby, it 
is that a horse needs decisive, sure-handed management to win. Horses such as 
Winning Colors and Sunny's Halo succeeded only because their trainers devoted 
almost fanatical concentration on this one objective. Red Ransom didn't even 
get to his first start of the year in a fashion that would inspire confidence 
or respect. 
</P>
<P>
The colt skipped a Feb. 17 allowance race in which he would have been a cinch 
because Miller felt he needed one more solid workout. After he had that good 
workout, Miller entered him in an allowance race Feb. 24 that even the most 
inept trainer would recognize was wholly unsuitable-a race against tough, older 
stakes-class sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of the race, Miller telephoned the stewards to scratch his 
horse, saying that the workout had taken too much out of him. Two days later, 
he announced that he was firing jockey Randy Romero for the too-fast workout 
and replacing him with Pat Day. 
</P>
<P>
The trainer and owner have the prerogative to use any jockey they want, and 
they may have good reason for preferring Day to Romero. But firing Romero 
because of the workout was a craven explanation and a bum rap. 
</P>
<P>
"I was there," said Romero's agent Lenny Goodman. "I heard the orders: 'I want 
a good sharp work.' " 
</P>
<P>
With his new jockey, Day, Red Ransom finally made his long-awaited debut 
against a seemingly weak allowance field Saturday. But he ran into an 
unexpectedly tough horse, Bright Again, who delivered an exceptional 
performance and held off the favorite by more than a length. Red Ransom's 
effort wasn't a bad one, but it wasn't what one would expect of a 2-5 shot who 
had been hailed as a superstar. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's explanation? He hadn't worked Red Ransom hard enough. 
</P>
<P>
"He worked well here but I didn't do much with him between the work and the 
race," the trainer said. "Maybe I was too easy on him. The going was a little 
deep and he got tired. I think he's capable of running much better. If not, we 
won't go to Louisville." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Miller was back in Aiken. 
</P>
<P>
Mack Miller obviously is not a man with a burning desire to win the Kentucky 
Derby, and few racing people would be surprised if Red Ransom wound up missing 
the Kentucky Derby and making his mark later in the season-at Saratoga in 
August, for example. But in a year when the Derby is wide open, it is a shame 
to see a colt like this wasted on an owner and trainer who are above caring 
about the race that everybody else so passionately wants to win. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Fountain of Youth, McGaughey and owner Dinny Phipps were standing 
just outside the press box, waiting to watch Rhythm run, and you could see the 
tension etched on their faces. Phipps may be worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars, and McGaughey may have an Eclipse Award on his mantel, but they still 
cared passionately about their colt's performance Saturday and his prospects 
for the Triple Crown series. 
</P>
<P>
After Rhythm ran so disappointingly, McGaughey surely was agonizing about the 
reasons and trying to figure a way to make the horse run better the next time. 
So were Stephens and Schulhofer. These men may sometimes wish they could leave 
town and let an assistant worry about a potential champion, but they know 
that's not the way to win a race as demanding as the Derby.

Adam Keefe scored 20 points and Kenny Ammann added 18 to lead Stanford to a 
79-58 Pacific 10 Conference victory over California on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears scored only 18 points in the second half and went nearly 12 minutes 
without a basket. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Drew led Cal with 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford (17-10, 9-9) led, 45-40, at halftime, but Brian Hendrick made a short 
jumper to cut the lead to 48-44 with 17:07 remaining. The Bears (21-8, 12-6) 
didn't score another field goal until Drew's layup with 5:16 left in the game. 
At that point, Stanford led, 71-52. 
</P>
<P>
Ammann sparked a 14-4 run that gave Stanford a 59-44 lead on a Keefe layup with 
13:43 remaining. The Bears closed to within 62-48 before Stanford went on a 9-2 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Cal point guard Keith Smith got into early foul trouble and finished with just 
11 points and four assists. 
</P>
<P>
After squandering a 16-point second half lead and losing to Cal, 66-63, on 
Wednesday, the Cardinal wasn't about to give in again. "We were really ready to 
compete," Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said. "That was the best 40 minutes of 
basketball we've played all year. It's hard to believe that we won by 20 here 
at Cal." 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Smith and Hendrick were saddled on the bench with foul 
trouble and Cal's offense was never the same. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, Stanford played a very fine game, but the foul trouble really hurt 
us," Cal Coach Lou Campanelli said "We were tentative in the second half and we 
weren't able to do the things we needed to do to win."

Ingersoll-Rand Sues Over Partnerships: Ingersoll-Rand Financial Corp. filed 
suit in Superior Court claiming that a group of individuals and small real 
estate and financial companies in Southern California conspired against the New 
Jersey firm by setting up fraudulent limited partnerships. Ingersoll-Rand lent 
the partnerships money to fund small real estate development projects, but much 
of the money was siphoned to fees and commissions for the general partners, the 
suit said. Ingersoll claims that it lost more than $8 million.

American Continental Corp. officials prepared for the first major federal 
examination of Irvine, Calif.-based Lincoln Savings and Loan in 1986 by 
rewriting thousands of pages of corporate documents and falsifying directors' 
signatures, a newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Phoenix-based American Continental, run by financier Charles 
H. Keating Jr., destroyed the original documents, according to the Arizona 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have long alleged that forgery and back-dating of files and 
documents were common throughout much of American Continental's ownership of 
Lincoln Savings. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said it obtained copies of Lincoln's board of directors' minutes 
and resolutions dated from Feb. 22, 1984, when Keating bought Lincoln, through 
Dec. 30, 1985. The newspaper hired James Hale, a certified questioned-documents 
examiner, to examine the signatures on the documents. 
</P>
<P>
Hale concluded that 1,080 of 1,822 signatures were falsified. He said that all 
of the signatures on 235 of 432 of the documents were falsified and that only 
78 documents contained all authentic signatures, according to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that a former attorney for Lincoln Savings and Loan, Mark 
Sauter, and a former American Continental paralegal, Sherry Blixt Smith, 
admitted that the documents were rewritten and the signatures faked, but they 
called the changes technical. They said the alterations were neither 
significant nor deceitful. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental filed for protection from creditors in Bankruptcy Court in 
April 1989. The government subsequently took control of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Keating is the target of federal and congressional probes and on Friday was 
named in accusations by California state authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Employees said the documents were rewritten during an effort before the start 
of a seven-month-long examination of the thrift's books by the San Francisco 
office of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in March 1986.

JAPANESE SEE PEOPLE AS TOP PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY YOSHIHARA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual acknowledgement of a "people problem" at their manufacturing 
plants, Japanese managers in the United States said labor and personnel affairs 
are the most troublesome issues that they face, according to a new survey by a 
Japanese government agency. 
</P>
<P>
To date, most Japanese companies in the United States have shied away from 
publicly taking on workplace issues. They have quietly settled lawsuits brought 
by disgruntled workers, minimized friction on union organizing attempts at some 
plants and largely not addressed complaints of American executives at Japanese 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
"This time we were surprised that the most frequently mentioned problem had to 
do with labor, employment and personnel issues," said Mitsuo Takii, executive 
director of the New York office of the Japan External Trade Organization, or 
Jetro, which conducted the ninth annual survey of Japanese-affiliated 
manufacturers in the United States. "Compared to 1988, the instability of the 
exchange rate was more of an issue then." 
</P>
<P>
More than a quarter of the 505 Japanese managers responding to a question about 
management problems cited difficulties in securing and training a good work 
force. Another 9.5% cited differences in thinking and customs between Japan and 
the United States. "From this, it may be safe to say that the largest issue 
facing Japanese managers in this country was the 'people problem,' " the survey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1989 survey, participants were asked to write in their responses to the 
question. The previous year, they were given a list of 14 possible answers. In 
1988, the three most frequently cited concerns were instability of the exchange 
rate, quality control and difficulty in finding quality labor. 
</P>
<P>
The survey covered only U.S. manufacturing plants owned or affiliated with 
Japanese companies. It did not cover Japanese firms in banking, insurance, real 
estate, financial services, travel and other service-related industries. 
</P>
<P>
However, a study released last October by the University of Michigan revealed 
that American managers at Japanese corporations felt excluded from planning and 
decision making inside their firms and complained about limited access to 
strategic information. 
</P>
<P>
The Jetro survey showed a total of 1,043 Japanese-owned manufacturing plants in 
the United States in 1989, compared to 837 in 1988 and 550 in 1987. Nearly 60% 
of the plants were established after 1985 in the wake of the sharp appreciation 
of the yen and in response to criticism that Japanese firms were taking jobs 
away from Americans. 
</P>

Alaska Airlines Hopeful Over Soviet Talks: Alaska Airlines executives say they 
are encouraged by a preliminary agreement that could lead to the first 
scheduled air service to the Soviet Far East by the summer of 1991. U.S. and 
Soviet negotiators meeting in London announced an agreement in principle to 
open commercial air service between Anchorage and the Soviet Far East cities of 
Magadan and Khabarovsk. If a final agreement is reached, Alaska Airlines hopes 
to offer two to three flights a week starting in 1991.

JAPAN'S NEXT EXPORT MAY BE ITS ELDERLY, U.S. DEVELOPER SUSPECTS; 
</P>
<P>
AGING: OTHERS, HOWEVER, SCOFF AT THE SUGGESTION THAT THE JAPANESE ARE BUYING 
GOLF COURSES HERE AS SITES TO BUILD ASIAN RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES LATER.

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago, Japan's powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
floated the idea of exporting a new commodity to the United States and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
But for a change the Japanese found no ready market for the export, which was 
not a fancy new television or camcorder or car. Rather, it was Japanese 
retirees. Faced with criticism at home and abroad that Japan was advocating the 
separation of families and attempting to dump responsibility for its aged onto 
other lands, MITI soon deep-sixed the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent forum here, a San Francisco Bay Area developer suggested that the 
idea might be coming back around, given that Japan must soon figure out how to 
deal with its rapidly growing pool of elderly. 
</P>
<P>
So what makes him think that retirement communities in the United States might 
be in the offing? 
</P>
<P>
"Shrewd Japanese investors . . . are buying golf courses with excess land to 
develop housing," said William H. C. Chang, 33, president of Westlake Builders, 
a San Mateo, Calif., developer of retirement facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a relatively easy transformation to convert such land into 
retirement villages," said Chang, who was born in Japan of a Japanese mother 
and a Chinese father. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Japanese interests have snapped up a number of premium golf properties 
in the past few years, including the Riviera Country Club &amp; Golf Course in 
Pacific Palisades (for $108 million) and Napa County's Silverado Country Club 
&amp; Resort. 
</P>
<P>
Ostensibly, the Japanese seem to be taking advantage of their awesome spending 
power to pick up prestigious properties, partly to provide an alternative to 
Japanese clubs, where million-dollar memberships are common. 
</P>
<P>
But Chang contends that golf, a sport the Japanese love, isn't their only 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
His late-afternoon comments roused a roomful of drowsy participants at a recent 
Pacific Rim real estate conference sponsored by the law firm of Baker &amp; 
McKenzie at San Francisco's Hotel Nikko. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like an excellent idea," said John A. Lisanti, president of American 
International Golf Resorts in Greenbrae, Calif., a company that puts together 
golf course deals for Japanese investors. 
</P>
<P>
To him, maybe. But many other real estate developers -- both Japanese and U.S. 
-- contend that Japanese traditions and culture would prevent the idea from 
ever getting off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
When the notion was first proposed in 1986 "it got such rave reviews that 
somebody almost got his throat slashed," said an executive of a U.S. company 
that operates nursing homes and retirement centers. 
</P>
<P>
The idea received a flurry of publicity when it was advanced by a Japanese 
government official who had returned from a posting in Spain, where he saw how 
far European retirees' money could go. Under the "Silver Columbia Plan," as it 
was called, private companies were to develop retirement communities, or 
"silver towns," by 1992, the 500th anniversary of Columbus' landing in America. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Spain, countries mentioned as possible sites included the United 
States, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, various Asian nations and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
The plan quickly drew criticism from many of those countries, which envisioned 
having to provide medical care and other age-related services to hordes of 
expatriate Japanese. And in Japan, where the elderly traditionally have been 
cared for at home by family members, officials also took heat. MITI abandoned 
the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a cultural abhorrence of this," said Barry Robinson, associate 
editor of Ageing International magazine in Washington. "It was very 
un-Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Chang's thesis, however, Robinson noted that, even though the 
government-sponsored effort has been shot down, private Japanese developers 
might yet consider building such communities overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the rapid aging of densely packed Japan cries out for solutions. 
Because of a falling birth rate and longer life expectancies, the country is 
aging far more quickly than most others. 
</P>
<P>
Revised statistics from the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare indicate a 
cloud in the "silver" lining. Whereas a year ago it was estimated that Japan 
would have 20 million people over age 65 by the year 2000, the new numbers show 
an even higher figure: 21.3 million, or 16.6% of the population, according to 
researchers at the East-West Center in Honolulu who analyzed the data. 
</P>
<P>
The elderly population will peak in 2020, when nearly 24% will be part of the 
"silver" crowd and Japan will have one of the oldest populations on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
It is customary in Japan for sons and daughters to take in aging parents. But 
as more Japanese women enter the work force, the Confucian belief in "filial 
piety" is losing ground, observers say. At the same time, land is becoming 
scarcer and prohibitively expensive. 
</P>
<P>
And that raises the question: Where will all those elderly live? 
</P>
<P>
Sanford R. Goodkin, a San Diego real estate consultant, figures that it is 
inevitable that some will end up in overseas retirement communities. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese have been pursuing expertise in this area for eight or nine 
years," said Goodkin, executive director of the Peat Marwick Main/Goodkin Real 
Estate Consulting Group. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a subsidiary of Nisshin Steel Co. of Japan is investing in a joint 
venture with the LeisureCare division of Leisure Technology Inc., a Los 
Angeles-based developer of retirement communities, to build 44 retirement 
centers in North America over the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Japanese are "a long way off" from building anything overseas 
targeted strictly to Japanese elderly, said Jerry Falcon, president of 
LeisureCare, based in Northbrook, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, many affluent Japanese have been buying winter homes in such sunny 
spots as Hawaii, San Diego and Australia's Gold Coast. But many observers see a 
massive shift of Japanese old people overseas as highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Japanese are not very comfortable in spending old age in other countries 
where they don't understand the language and the culture," said Yukuo Takenaka, 
president and chief executive of Takenaka &amp; Co., a Los Angeles investment 
banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies, in fact, are involved in joint ventures with U.S. firms to 
develop retirement communities on their home turf. They include centers along 
waterfronts and in rural areas, to get the elderly away from congested cities. 
</P>
<P>
Another idea under study in Japan is "silver manpower centers," where the 
elderly could live and work, said Richard K. C. Lee, a retiree who works part 
time as a specialist on aging at the East-West Center's Population Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government, meanwhile, is encouraging other governments to grant 
extended visa privileges to older Japanese tourists to enable them to stay 
overseas a few months at a time, rather than the few days' visits that are now 
the norm, according to Kazuo Hoshino, a MITI official. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, he said, would enable Japanese to experience life overseas without 
living "abroad for good." 
</P>
<P>
Chang remains convinced that Japanese "silver towns" are a likelihood. By 2000, 
he said, technological advances such as supersonic travel will make overseas 
retirement feasible. 
</P>
<P>
And golf course purchases, he added, "are just the tip of the iceberg."

LEARNING THE MECHANICS OF BIG BUSINESS;

EDUCATION: THE LOS ANGELES ACADEMY OF FINANCE OFFERS SOME HIGH-SCHOOLERS A 
UNIQUE COMBINATION OF CLASS WORK AND HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE.

For 17-year-old Andrea Chung, landing her first job downtown at Kidder, Peabody 
&amp; Co. was a thrill, something more often achieved by MBA students than high 
school students. 
</P>
<P>
It was also alarming. 
</P>
<P>
Once, while recording market transactions at the brokerage last summer -- a job 
that paid her $7 an hour -- the senior at Los Angeles High School said a 
broker's illegible handwriting caused her to mistakenly punch in 1 million 
shares, instead of 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was going to get fired," she said, "but my assistant supervisor 
said don't worry about it." The number was corrected. 
</P>
<P>
Chung is one of 90 teen-agers from Los Angeles and Downtown Business Magnet 
high schools who have received a head start in Los Angeles' booming financial 
community by participating in the Los Angeles Academy of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
The academy was founded in 1988 by American Express Co. and the Los Angeles 
Educational Partnership. It is affiliated with the National Academy of Finance 
in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Although, the two-year elective program wasn't designed for minorities, 66% of 
the students in the Los Angeles academy are African-American and Latino and 28% 
are Asian. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants say the demographics just reflect Los Angeles's diverse ethnic 
population. They hope the program will expand beyond the two schools, which 
were chosen because of their proximity to the downtown business community. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, 20 businesses, including Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch, offer minimum 
six-week, entry-level summer internships. Salaries range from minimum wage to 
$8 per hour, John O'Malley, a consultant, said. 
</P>
<P>
The students' duties vary from researching and filing to handling stocks and 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of them (supervisors) didn't know we were in high school until 
we told them," a proud Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the program, interested students must have at least a C average 
and be willing to learn, said Golding. They don't have to be interested in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Zuri Hudson, an eleventh-grader at Downtown Business Magnet, said the program's 
broad business scope will always give her "something to lean on," even if she 
doesn't become an accountant in the fashion industry. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, students are also taught interviewing skills and corporate attire, 
because most have never worked before. If they did, they held jobs at fast-food 
restaurants or supermarkets, O'Malley said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Akin, managing director of Merrill Lynch on South Hope Street, said he 
was pleased with his intern's performance last summer. "We treated her like we 
would an MBA." 
</P>
<P>
Students supplement their regular high school courses by taking two of the 
academy's designated electives in banking and credit or securities operations, 
for example. Seniors attend a once-a-week, tuition-free business course at the 
University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Program organizers say it is a good, challenging and unique program that helps 
students become business professionals by combining college-level courses and 
on-the-job training. 
</P>
<P>
The students, who were often called "nerds" by fellow high-schoolers, have even 
amazed themselves. "It was hard," said Terrence Banks, a Los Angeles High 
senior who interned at Wells Fargo last summer. "I was close to quitting . . . 
but something told me not to quit." 
</P>
<P>
The National Academy Foundation -- formerly the American Express Foundation -- 
is providing $75,000 for the intense program.

DEALS: MARKET WATCH;

<P>
BEING SLICKER THAN TEFLON AT AMERICAN EXPRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
James D. Robinson III has a set of moves that even the late Harry Houdini, the 
leading escape artist of his time, would have admired. The difference is that 
Houdini escaped from tanks filled with water, and Robinson, chairman of 
American Express Co., escapes from tanks filled with sharks. Corporate sharks, 
that is. 
</P>
<P>
It is really slick. Within the past year, Robinson has walked away, seemingly 
untouched, from at least four debacles that would have gotten most corporate 
chairmen torn apart. The list: 
</P>
<P>
* The disaster at Shearson Lehman Hutton, in which American Express finally 
said Sunday that it would buy up the 39% of the stock in the brokerage that it 
doesn't already own by exchanging 0.426 of its own shares for each Shearson 
share. 
</P>
<P>
* The Safra scandal, in which American Express was caught falsely accusing 
banker Edmund Safra, one of its competitors, of laundering money, and ended up 
agreeing to pay $8 million to Safra-selected charities to buy its way out of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
* The insider trading scandal, in which American Express' investment banker, 
Salim B. (Sandy) Lewis, pleaded guilty to manipulating the price of Fireman's 
Fund stock upward on American Express' behalf. There's no sign that AmEx knew 
or condoned what Lewis has pleaded guilty to doing, but it raises the question 
of how American Express came to have a crook representing it. 
</P>
<P>
* The RJR Nabisco fiasco, described in the best-selling book "Barbarians at the 
Gate." The authors describe in great detail the behind-the-scenes role that 
Robinson, unhappy with the way Shearson Chairman Peter A. Cohen was handling 
things, played in trying to help Shearson do the deal. Cohen has taken the 
blame, but you have to wonder why Shearson fared so miserably despite so much 
personal attention from Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
In most big, visible companies such as AmEx, any of these four reverses would 
have led to reams of news articles wondering who should be blamed. Any two 
within a year would have sparked a spate of "What's Going On at American 
Express?" articles. All four would have put the chairman on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, here is Jim Robinson, sailing along, seemingly unscathed. Likewise, 
American Express maintains its reputation as a well-managed, high-class 
company. This has to be one of the best jobs of financial public relations in 
the memory of man. It's such a good campaign that you don't even see it. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the Shearson debacle. AmEx, which paid $900 million for Shearson in 
1981 and up until Sunday's announcement owned 61% of it, had been offering 
Shearson around for months. Last week American Express said if it couldn't find 
a buyer it was going to put $1 billion into Shearson just to save it. As the 
late Sen. Everett Dirksen once said, "A billion dollars here and a billion 
dollars there, and soon you're talking about real money." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, of course, wasn't running Shearson. But he had AmEx buy the company, 
he presided over the departure of Shearson Chairman Sanford I. (Sandy) Weill 
and he installed Cohen, on whose watch disaster has struck. 
</P>
<P>
How does Robinson escape all this unscathed? 
</P>
<P>
Part of the answer, of course, is that except for Shearson, none of these 
things makes a significant difference in American Express' income statement. 
</P>
<P>
As American Express' first-rate public relations people point out, shareholders 
have done quite well under Robinson. American Express' stock is up 367% in the 
10 years ending Dec. 31, 1989, compared to 228% for the Dow Jones industrials 
and 227% for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. American Express makes 
good money; its balance sheet is strong; it has made some fine acquisitions 
such as Investors Diversified Services. 
</P>
<P>
You can argue that American Express would have done even better had it stuck to 
its franchises rather than embarking on a series of glitzy, largely 
undistinguished diversifications that distracted money and management effort 
from credit cards, direct marketing and Travel Related Services. But that's an 
abstract argument, hard for stockholders to get excited about. 
</P>
<P>
The real secret to Robinson's ability to escape being tarred with disasters is 
probably that he is extremely adept at what PR people call "damage control." 
This often seems to consist of throwing people over the side, quickly. These 
human sacrifices seem to appease the gods. It's the decentralized, "my 
responsibility, your fault" school of management. 
</P>
<P>
This has been the pattern since at least 1979, when American Express launched a 
hostile takeover attempt for McGraw-Hill, the publisher of Business Week 
magazine, then backed off for reasons that have never been disclosed. The human 
sacrifice in that case was American Express President Roger Morley, who also 
served on the board of McGraw-Hill. He's now known in some quarters as 
"Morley's ghost." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Cohen served as the human sacrifice for both the Shearson and RJR Nabisco 
reverses. And Harry Freeman, an executive vice president in the corporate 
affairs department, took early retirement for failing to detect and stop the 
smear campaign against Safra. Sandy Lewis, of course, was the fall guy for the 
Fireman's Fund manipulation, which took place years ago but for which Lewis 
pleaded guilty last year. 
</P>
<P>
In all, an amazing escape record. If Robinson can ever distill and manufacture 
whatever it is that allows him to be so good at deflecting criticism, American 
Express will have a fabulous new product. One that will put Teflon to shame.

ART: DEBORAH MARROW AIMS TO BROADEN THE PROGRAM'S INTERNATIONAL CONSTITUENCY. 
IT HAS AWARDED $20 MILLION IN ITS FIRST FIVE YEARS.

<P>
It isn't easy to give away the J. Paul Getty Trust's money, but the Getty Grant 
Program has managed to disburse $20 million during its first five years of 
operation. Five hundred and thirty grants have been awarded to art historians, 
conservators and art museums in 18 countries. 
</P>
<P>
Ministering to a wide range of needs, Getty grants have helped to repair 
earthquake-damaged murals in Mexico City, to develop a user-friendly display of 
Native American art at the Denver Art Museum and to publish books on French 
daguerreotypes and Italian painter Artemisia Gentileschi. Scholars have used 
Getty money to study Japanese hand scrolls, Tuscan stained glass and the social 
history of German modern art. Museums around the world have catalogued their 
collections and hired interns, courtesy of the Getty. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty million dollars has covered a lot of ground, but the road to scholarly 
philanthropy is tortuous, according to Deborah Marrow, director of the grant 
program. An art historian whose specialty is 17th-Century French and Italian 
art, Marrow joined the Getty seven years ago as a publications coordinator. She 
took over the Getty Grant Program at its inception, in 1984, and now heads a 
staff of eight, which is housed in a Santa Monica high-rise but eventually will 
move to the J. Paul Getty Center under construction in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is trained to be a grant maker. Everyone falls into the field from 
somewhere else. I fell into it from art history," Marrow said. While she has 
had to put a practical edge on her academic skills, the program she administers 
also has faced challenges. 
</P>
<P>
First came the task of introducing the program through brochures (printed in 
five languages), public appearances and published announcements to inform 
qualified applicants about grant opportunities. Now the program is so well 
known in the United States and Western Europe that 250 scholars have applied 
for 21 fellowships to be awarded in 1990, but Marrow and her staff are still 
working to give the program a broader international reach. That means traveling 
and directing information toward scholars and institutions in countries that 
are out of the loop of Western art history. 
</P>
<P>
Once potential applicants make themselves known, they are given grant 
guidelines and counseled to help them qualify. In general, the program supports 
projects that "promote research in the history of art and the humanities, the 
understanding of art, and conservation," according to the guidelines. Grants 
are not given for operating expenses, endowment funds, building construction or 
maintenance, or acquisition of works of art. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of our time is spent explaining the program and helping people who have 
eligible projects to prepare applications," Marrow said. When applications are 
ready, they are subject to peer review by independent scholars and specialists. 
Most proposals are judged by two field specialists and an advisory committee of 
four to eight people who serve three-year terms. Reviewers are paid an 
honorarium -- say $150 for reading a proposal and submitting a written 
assessment. The payment is essentially a token of appreciation for work done in 
the spirit of "service to the field," Marrow said. 
</P>
<P>
The program aims to give grants to the most deserving and feasible projects. No 
quotas apply to subject matter or applicants, and the Getty doesn't advocate 
particular projects. "We just respond to the applications that we receive," 
Marrow said. Applications tend to reflect current developments, however. 
Conservators are increasingly attuned to technical processes, while the study 
of art history has become more theoretical and interdisciplinary, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The J. Paul Getty Trust's wealth has been so widely publicized that people 
often expect Getty grants to be much larger than they are, Marrow said. The 
trust's first priority by law is to create and administer its own nonprofit 
programs, such as the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Getty Conservation 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
As an operating trust, the Getty can spend up to 0.75% of the $3.2-billion 
market value of its endowment on gifts and grants, however. The Getty Grant 
Program was established under this provision. 
</P>
<P>
Grants so far have run from $640 for the publication of a book on two 
14th-Century Dominican altar paintings to $1 million for a five-year research 
project on the effects of new information technologies on research, scholarship 
and teaching, administered by the Council on Library Resources in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually don't pay for an entire project. We try to leverage our support," 
Marrow said. Conservation grants generally require recipients to raise matching 
funds, for example. Instead of picking up the entire tab for publications, 
grants may provide for additional illustrations or allow a book's purchase 
price to be lowered. Postdoctoral fellowships of $23,000, on the other hand, 
are intended to replace the recipients' salaries for a year so that they can 
concentrate on research and writing. 
</P>
<P>
One unusually large grant of $250,000 was recently awarded to the International 
Center for the Study of the Preservation and the Restoration of Cultural 
Property in Rome. The Italian organization will use the funds in Africa to 
train local museum staffs to care for their national treasures. This program 
follows a Getty-funded pilot project for Africans who spent a year in Rome 
learning conservation techniques. In the pilot project, the African 
conservators learned practical methods, "not just how to use a lot of fancy 
equipment that they don't have at home," Marrow said. The next phase of the 
project is intended to ensure that entire museum staffs understand concepts of 
conservation and work together to care for their collections. 
</P>
<P>
Such projects are exciting to Marrow because they provide models that are 
likely to be emulated by other organizations and they are graphic illustrations 
of what Getty grants can accomplish. Verbal explanations of the grant program 
are never as effective as models that can be seen and experienced, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Marrow plans to go on talking about the Getty Grant Program, however, and five 
years haven't dampened her enthusiasm. "It's a great job. Having an 
international overview of what's going on in all these fields and seeing the 
shape of art history is a real privilege. It's frustrating not to be able to 
help everyone who applies, but that's an inevitable part of the process," she 
said.

THE DISNEY CHANNEL TURNS TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: MORNING IS FOR PRESCHOOLERS, AFTERNOON FOR TEENS, BUT THE SHOWS 
GROW UP AT NIGHT.

The Disney Channel isn't just for kids anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Of its more than 4.3 million subscribers, about 24% have no children younger 
than 18. Another 9% only have kids between ages 12 and 18. 
</P>
<P>
"What our goal has been is to appeal to all segments of the household," said 
Disney Channel president John Cooke. "If you're really going to be a 
family-service channel, what ought to happen is, in the mornings, preschoolers 
ought to be entertained, preteens and teens in the afternoons, families from 6 
to 9 p.m. and adults from 9 p.m. on." 
</P>
<P>
So the 7-year-old pay-TV service has developed a programming mix that ranges 
from a fashionable new "Mickey Mouse Club" to classic Hollywood films, from 
original TV movies and series to vintage TV spectaculars. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney Channel has bolstered the ratings of its 4-6 p.m. lineup thanks to 
the success of the new "Mickey Mouse Club," which began last April. 
</P>
<P>
"Viewership of preteens and teens has gone up 70%," Cooke said. "We've received 
over 60,000 letters from viewers since last April." 
</P>
<P>
The new "Mickey Mouse Club," which airs weekdays at 5:30 p.m., is a 
contemporary, slicker version of the classic '50s series. There's nary a set of 
Mouseketeer ears in sight but plenty of moussed hair and trendy gear. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Fields, senior vice president of original programming, admitted that 
the channel was a little nervous mounting the series because another revamped 
"Mickey Mouse Club" had failed in syndication a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we learned some things that they did and didn't do," Fields said. "Our 
goals were to produce a show that was very much in the spirit of the original, 
that respected kids, was entertaining and featured kids that kids at home could 
relate to. Some of the kids have little training, some have professional 
experience, but they're real kids." 
</P>
<P>
Two other series aimed at youngsters are in the works for the fall. "Jim 
Henson's Mother Goose," based on the classic nursery rhymes and featuring new 
Jim Henson puppets, will air Saturday mornings. "Little Mermaid's Island," 
airing weekdays, will star the characters from Disney's hit animated film and 
feature four new songs in each 30-minute episode. 
</P>
<P>
During the 6-9 p.m. time period, the Disney Channel premieres new series, 
made-for-TV movies and family films, including a vintage (colorized) Shirley 
Temple film every month. 
</P>
<P>
The service has scored great critical success with the projects of Canadian 
film maker Kevin Sullivan. His award-winning miniseries "Anne of Green Gables" 
and "Anne of Avonlea" (also seen on the Public Broadcasting Service) have 
proved very popular with subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten a substantial number of letters from the last three years saying, 
'Please play more of "Anne of Green Gables," please make more of "Anne of Green 
Gables." ' We found a need out there from our audience for this kind of 
entertainment," Rider said. 
</P>
<P>
Disney complied with its viewers' wishes. Premiering tonight at 8 is its new 
weekly series "Avonlea." Like "Anne of Green Gables" and "Anne of Avonlea," the 
13-part comedy-drama is based on the stories of Canadian author Lucy Maud 
Montgomery. (See accompanying review.) 
</P>
<P>
The Disney Channel's original movies run the gamut from heartwarming to hip. 
Coming March 24 is the adventure "Chips, the War Dog," starring William Devane 
and Brandon Douglas. It is based on the real-life exploits of a German shepherd 
from Indiana who joins the service during World War II and becomes a decorated 
hero. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled for May is a musical, "Mother Goose Rock 'N' Rhyme," starring and 
produced by Shelley Duvall. The musical fantasy features Ben Vereen as the Itsy 
Bitsy Spider, Little Richard as Old King Cole, Howie Mandel as Humpty Dumpty, 
Paul Simon as Simple Simon and Pia Zadora as Little Miss Muffet. 
</P>
<P>
Disney veteran Hayley Mills stars in the drama "Back Home," scheduled for June, 
about a mother and daughter coping with the aftermath of World War II in 
England. And on tap for the fall is "Little Kidnapers," starring Charlton 
Heston and Bruce Greenwood, about two young orphans and their Scottish 
grandfather in turn-of-the-century Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney Channel has grown savvy in its adult programming. The channel 
brought humorist Garrison Keillor's acclaimed radio show "Prairie Home 
Companion" to TV and has aired several more specials featuring the shy 
Minnesotan. Disney hopes it has found the next Keillor in National Public 
Radio's Mike Feldman. The channel unveiled Feldman's half-hour comedy series, 
"Whad'ya Know?," Sunday and it continues at 9 p.m. every Sunday through March. 
</P>
<P>
The channel also presented Fred Astaire's restored Emmy Award-winning TV 
specials from the late '50s and early '60s and just completed a three-month run 
of the classic British '60s musical series, "Ready Steady Go!," featuring 
concert footage of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Animals and 
the Dave Clark 5. Beginning in April, Disney will air every other month for the 
next two years one of Frank Sinatra's 13 classic TV specials. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke said that after the Disney Channel aired the three Astaire specials, 
viewers and critics stood up and took notice of its programming. "I think it 
was a bit of an eye opener," he said. "People said, 'I didn't know the Disney 
Channel was doing that sort of thing.' "

BBC TO EXPAND NEWS IN U.S., EASTERN EUROPE

British Broadcasting Corp. has announced plans to expand its news programs in 
the United States and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the main principles behind the success of our international 
broadcasting is that we broadcast to our friends as well as those who -- until 
recently -- were enemies," said John Tusa, managing director of the BBC World 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk to open as well as to closed societies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tusa said that later this month, Americans will be able to dial up the latest 
BBC news program by telephone at any time "for less than a dollar a minute." 
One cable television service, C-SPAN, is devoting an audio channel to a 24-hour 
relay of BBC news, and Tusa expects it to grow from its present 1 million 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Tusa, who was born in Czechoslovakia, said Eastern European countries still 
need to hear controversy, comment and news from a broad international 
viewpoint. He said non-Communist leaders in Eastern Europe have asked the BBC 
to continue its programming and are giving it facilities for local rebroadcast. 
</P>
<P>
VOA Services Survive Cuts: The Voice of America, responding to pressure from 
its managers and listeners, has decided to save six language services slated 
for elimination by budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
VOA Director Richard Carlson informed employees in Washington on Friday that 
the Lao, Greek, Turkish, Swahili, Slovene and Uzbek language programs will 
remain on the air and that their 57 broadcasters and producers will keep their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came just one month after Carlson informed employees the 
services would go off the air April 1 to save the government's radio network $3 
million. "We will be given the money to keep the services on the air," Carlson 
said.

MIDDLE-CLASS BACKLASH HITS AT PANHANDLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID TREADWELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a federal court judge here struck down a long-standing ban against 
panhandling at the Port Authority bus terminal, James Benagh could not wait to 
apply for one of the new begging permits transit officials began issuing to 
comply with the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"I put on my best suit and tie, shined my shoes and shaved -- everything -- and 
got the very first permit," the 52-year-old New Yorker proudly recalled. 
</P>
<P>
But Benagh had no intention of using the permit to wheedle spare change out of 
the thousands of travelers and commuters who daily pass in and out of the 
mammoth depot near Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
As a New York Times sports copy editor and the author of 26 books -- the latest 
a biography of football star Herschel Walker -- Benagh earns a comfortable 
living without having to moonlight as a panhandler. 
</P>
<P>
His real aim, he candidly admits, was altogether different. He wanted to make 
sure that as few of the permits as possible went to the people the federal 
judge had in mind when he declared that panhandling was a constitutionally 
protected form of free speech for "the least affluent, least powerful and least 
welcome." 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the judge's ruling was so ridiculous," Benagh said. "I don't want to 
sound like some right-wing beggar-basher, but you can't go anywhere in this 
city without someone pestering you for money anymore. I even had a beggar pull 
a knife on one of my kids once." 
</P>
<P>
Benagh's complaint is no isolated beef. From Southern California to Atlanta, as 
downtown business districts are being overrun by homeless people and as 
panhandlers are confronting middle-class citizens with increasingly aggressive 
and frightening tactics, Americans are finding that their compassion and 
tolerance are wearing thin. 
</P>
<P>
New York, where residents daily encounter multitudes of destitute and 
down-and-out people, may provide some of the most extreme examples. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, for instance, Rodney Sumter said that he and his 3-year-old son 
were approached by a panhandler at the Columbus Circle subway station on 
Manhattan's West Side. Sumter said the man spit on him, shouted profanities at 
him and knocked him down with a punch to the eye. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Sumter reacted by ramming the panhandler's head onto the concrete 
platform, killing him. Sumter has been charged with first-degree manslaughter 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised by the amount of sympathy I felt for the father when I first 
heard of this case," said a native New Yorker, echoing what seems to be a not 
uncommon sentiment. "I used to be reduced to tears by the sight of homeless 
people . . . but my compassion is now mixed with a lot of anger and 
resentment." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere a similar hardening of public sympathy can be detected. 
</P>
<P>
In Philadelphia, for example, downtown merchants presented a petition last 
month to Mayor W. Wilson Goode claiming that they were "under siege" by 
panhandling crack addicts and the homeless. Goode promised to beef up police 
patrols, crack down on panhandlers and steer homeless people toward city 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't sit on the sidewalk in a box in broad daylight and prevent someone 
from walking on the sidewalk," said the mayor, who also beseeched 
Philadelphians not to give money to panhandlers but, instead, to donate to 
advocacy groups and charitable organizations dealing with the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
In both Atlanta and Miami, businessmen similarly are putting pressure on city 
officials to rid the downtown streets of what they consider unsavory elements. 
Atlanta businessmen want a "hospitality zone" between the downtown hotel 
district and Underground Atlanta, a brand-new, $142-million festival 
marketplace, that would be kept free of vagrants and homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members in Washington are studying proposals that would sharply 
curtail the city's obligation under a 6-year-old law guaranteeing anyone 
seeking emergency shelter the right to receive it. 
</P>
<P>
Since the measure was put into effect, the annual costs have more than tripled 
from $10 million to over $30 million, while the number of homeless people 
seeking emergency quarters has grown from less than 5,000 to more than 26,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that it is a real shame that there are so many homeless," said a 
secretary for a private firm in the capital city. "At the same time, I feel 
that they are all over -- at the top of the subway entrance, at the bottom of 
the subway, in the corners. You can't go anywhere without seeing the homeless. 
You lose your sensitivity to them." 
</P>
<P>
In Denver, officials of the Roman Catholic archdiocese are experiencing an 
erosion in financial support for their Samaritan House program to shelter and 
feed the homeless -- one of the major efforts of its kind there. 
</P>
<P>
"When we opened our first Samaritan House in 1981, we had incredible support 
and raised over $4 million for the construction of a larger shelter," said 
Father Charles Woodrich. "But that kind of support is just not there today. 
Poverty is becoming less popular." 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, city officials have proposed restrictions on mobile soup kitchens 
that would require them to provide portable toilets, tables and trash cans at 
each stop despite protests that such facilities would dramatically increase the 
costs of trying to feed the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
In Costa Mesa, city officials are evicting a social agency known as Share Our 
Selves from its quarters in a middle-class neighborhood and forcing it to move 
into an out-of-the-way industrial district. 
</P>
<P>
"People in Orange County have allowed the old conservative attitudes to raise 
their heads again, and the poor are suffering down there," said Scott Mather, 
chairman of the California Homeless Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Among the poor and homeless themselves, the new mood is particularly 
discernible by those with the longest experience on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Boyd, a 39-year-old Chicagoan who has been homeless since his release 
seven years ago from Joliet Penitentiary, said it used to take him a half-hour 
to make $10 panhandling when he first hit the streets. Now, he says, it can 
take up to 10 hours to make the same kind of money. "Maybe one of 20 gives me 
50 cents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
George Mills, 64, who has worked a block on Houston's Main Street since the 
mid-1960s, agrees. "People aren't giving nearly as much as they used to, maybe 
half as much," said Mills, a blind beggar with a tin cup and pencils. "There 
are more people out here asking for money, maybe that's it. When I started, I 
was the only one on this block. Now there's three or four regulars." 
</P>
<P>
Advocates for the poor and homeless are understandably disturbed at this latest 
twist in public attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at public opinion polls, you'll see the public consistently favors 
greater government aid to the homeless," said Maria Foscarinis, director of the 
National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty in Washington. "I think what's 
happened is public officials haven't responded to the growth in homelessness 
and to public demands for solutions. The result is that people are becoming 
frustrated at having to confront, day by day, the growing homeless problem." 
</P>
<P>
According to a 27-city survey last year by the U.S. Conference of Mayors -- 
which included the California cities of Los Angeles, Santa Monica, San Diego 
and San Francisco -- demand for emergency shelter for homeless people increased 
by an average of 25% from the year before -- the highest overall percentage 
jump in that measure since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The estimates of the number of American homeless range from 250,000 to more 
than 3 million. Whatever the real figure, local governments are making little 
headway against the problem. 
</P>
<P>
In Seattle the homeless population continues stubbornly to number about 2,500 
each night despite a total of $6 million each year in public and private 
expenditures for shelters and street programs and a growth in the city's 
subsidized housing stock to 19,000 units from 9,000 units in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"Seattle is part of the national problem," said Beverly Sims, co-chair of the 
Seattle-King County Coalition for the Homeless. "We're keeping people in 
shelters because they have nowhere else to go. We are becoming frustrated that 
homelessness is becoming institutionalized." 
</P>
<P>
But finding solutions to the problem remains elusive. 
</P>
<P>
In Portland, Ore., for example, the City Council recently approved a resolution 
calling for widespread "sweeps" to clean up the more than 50 sites where 
homeless squatters have settled, and building barriers to deter the homeless 
from returning. 
</P>
<P>
But Wendy Marsh, communications director for Burnside Community, a nonprofit 
organization serving the poor and homeless, said: "We've gone down to the 
'camps' and found out that most of the people are not drug abusers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot are vets whose psyches can't cope with the crowded conditions in the 
shelters. There are couples who don't want to be separated. There are also 
families of illegal aliens and . . . the new homeless who aren't ready to deal 
with the shelters, which have become a dumping ground for other people that 
society doesn't want to take care of." 
</P>
<P>
Even advocates for the homeless themselves sometimes do not see eye to eye. In 
Santa Monica, a service center for the homeless known as Step Up on Second has 
launched a campaign imploring the public to give money to homeless service 
agencies, not to street people. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes about 90% to alcohol and drugs, and not to food," said Susan Dempsay, 
Step Up's director. "And this is where the controversy comes in. Many people 
feel that if you have, you give." 
</P>
<P>
But Rabbi Jeffrey Perry-Marx of the Westside Ecumenical Council responded by 
citing a Jewish legend in which the prophet Elijah comes to Earth each week, 
often disguised as a beggar. 
</P>
<P>
"If when Elijah extends his hand, he is met with a smile and a contribution, he 
knows that perfect world for which we long is one step closer," Perry-Marx 
said. But if not, "he knows that, sadly, we have turned away from our vision of 
God's kingdom." 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to know what the new problem in the homeless issue is, it's 
drugs," said Debora Thomas, director of clinical services at the Open Door 
drop-in center for the homeless in Manhattan. "The drug problem has increased 
like crazy among the homeless in the past three to five years." 
</P>
<P>
Suspicions that so many of the more aggressive panhandlers are crack addicts 
may be behind much of the hardening of the public's attitude toward the poor 
and homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Most state and local officials and advocates for the homeless agree that 
without a stronger federal initiative and sharply increased federal funding, 
the homeless problem will continue. 
</P>
<P>
In his most recent budget plan, President Bush has proposed $728 million in 
funding for the McKinney Act, the major federal legislation providing aid to 
the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
That is an increase of $120 million over the previous year, but advocates for 
the homeless contend that it is minuscule compared to the nation's needs. 
</P>
<P>
It also is very little compared to the amounts state and local governments are 
spending to combat homelessness. In New York City alone, the Human Resources 
Administration spends about $330 million annually on such programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel the government should be doing more for homeless people," said Mike 
Steinberg, a Detroit attorney. "The government should be housing people, not 
the MX missile. But they're not going to do anything until enough people put 
pressure on them to do something."

GATHERS, LOYOLA BASKETBALL STAR, COLLAPSES, DIES

<P>
Loyola Marymount's Hank Gathers, the sixth-leading collegiate basketball scorer 
in the nation, died Sunday after collapsing during the Lions' West Coast 
Conference tournament semifinal game against the University of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Just after Gathers had made a slam dunk to give his team a 25-13 lead, he 
trotted to midcourt, put his hands on his knees and crumpled to the floor of 
Loyola Marymount's Albert Gersten Pavilion in Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
The athlete's right arm was pinned under his body as he went into convulsions, 
and he rolled over and got to his hands and knees before collapsing again. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated crowd of 4,000, which had wildly cheered his dunk, sat in stunned 
silence as the clock stopped with 13:34 to play in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers was surrounded by three physicians and his sobbing mother, Lucille, who 
screamed for help and slammed her fist on the hardwood floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I first noticed that Hank was in trouble just as he went to the floor," said 
Portland Coach Larry Steele. "It all happened so fast. Within two seconds, 
everybody realized that Hank needed help." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, 23, was taken off the court on a stretcher, and paramedics 
administered emergency treatment -- which included defibrillation -- as 
teammate and boyhood friend Bo Kimble and Coach Paul Westhead stood by. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty minutes later, Gathers was taken to Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital, 
where he was pronounced dead at 6:55 p.m., Loyola Marymount Athletic Director 
Brian Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried resuscitating him for over an hour and we were unable to generate any 
activity," cardiologist Dr. Mason Weiss said. He said an autopsy was scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
WCC Commissioner Michael Gilleran announced late Sunday that the remainder of 
the tournament was canceled. He said that Loyola Marymount would receive the 
league's automatic NCAA tournament bid based on its regular season record. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just trying to focus on what ought to take precedence -- something more 
important than winning, or losing, a ballgame," Gilleran said.

Gathers had a checkered medical history. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 9, he blacked out for a moment while at the free throw line during a 
game against UC Santa Barbara. He appeared to hyperventilate after he came to, 
and then walked off the floor. 
</P>
<P>
After a week of tests, doctors were unable to pinpoint a cause of his blackout, 
and he was put on medication to regulate his heartbeat. Gathers said doctors 
had felt that an accelerated heart rate may have led to his fainting. 
</P>
<P>
He came back to play on Dec. 30, scoring 22 points and getting 11 rebounds 
against Niagara. In January, though, Gathers complained that his body felt 
sluggish and persuaded doctors to reduce his medication. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, he scored 27 points and had 12 rebounds against LaSalle, in a 
triumphant return to his native Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-feet-7, 210 pounds, Gathers was an imposing specimen, who was projected as 
a high NBA draft choice after this, his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers averaged 29 points and 10.8 rebounds per game this season, and he holds 
career school and WCC scoring records. Gathers led the nation in both scoring 
and rebounding a year ago, averaging 32.7 points and 13.7 rebounds per game. It 
was only the second time that anyone had led both categories in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
He was one of the few players in collegiate history to score more than 2,500 
points and get more than 1,000 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers had been recruited by USC Coach Stan Morrison and played there for one 
season before transferring to Loyola Marymount when Morrison was ousted in 
favor of current Trojan Coach George Raveling.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although few were on hand to witness it, the space shuttle Atlantis capped a 
secret, four-day military mission by swooping out of a windy but blue 
California sky Sunday morning to glide into a picturesque landing at this 
Mojave Desert base. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle, which had blasted off early Wednesday from the Kennedy Space 
Center in Florida, landed on time at 10:08 a.m. PST. 
</P>
<P>
Sources have said that during its flight, the spacecraft placed in orbit a 
sophisticated photo-reconnaissance satellite designed to spy on the Soviet 
Union. NASA officials refused to confirm or deny this report. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the NASA officials honored a Pentagon-imposed news blackout 
concerning the flight. They also refused to allow the public onto Edwards to 
view the landing. Only a few hundred NASA workers and invited guests, as well 
as reporters, were allowed to watch. 
</P>
<P>
The mission apparently went well. "Congratulations on a great flight, guys, and 
welcome back," was the message radioed by NASA officials to the five-man, 
all-military crew upon the shuttle's return to Earth. And Atlantis pilot John 
H. Casper could be seen waving and giving a thumbs-up sign after the landing. 
</P>
<P>
The 100-ton craft, the youngest of the three shuttles, signaled its arrival 
over Edwards with its characteristic twin sonic booms. Approaching from the 
northwest, Atlantis nearly circled the base before landing at more than 200 
m.p.h. on Runway 23, a 5.2-mile-long clay strip on Rogers Dry Lake Bed. 
</P>
<P>
The bleachers and viewing areas that typically hold thousands of spectators for 
open shuttle landings were empty Sunday. The craft appeared in good shape and 
the crew exited about 50 minutes after landing. 
</P>
<P>
NASA officials, acknowledging that closed landings for military missions 
generate public complaints, said they plan to review that policy with defense 
officials. The result could be public viewing of future military shuttle 
landings, if the Pentagon agrees. 
</P>
<P>
Adverse weather had threatened to delay Atlantis' return Sunday, as rain was 
forecast and winds at times gusted above NASA limits. But no rain fell and, 
before the landing, the winds died down to head-wind gusts of 25 m.p.h., just 
under NASA's threshold. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorgeous," said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone, after the shuttle, trailing a 
cloud of dust, rolled to a stop right on the black center line of the runway, 
having traveled 71 orbits around the Earth. NASA clocked the flight at 4 days, 
10 hours and 18 minutes from start to touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Only two minor problems were reported as the shuttle descended toward Edwards. 
First, a circuit breaker on the craft was accidentally tripped, and then one of 
its hydraulic systems had a temporary drop in pressure. But NASA mission 
commentator Billie Deason said neither affected the landing. 
</P>
<P>
The blastoff had not gone so smoothly. NASA had wanted to launch Atlantis on 
Feb. 22. But poor weather, a computer problem and a cold that afflicted mission 
commander John O. Creighton caused five postponements before Wednesday's launch 
at 2:51 a.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis' mission was the 34th flight overall since the first shuttle flight in 
April, 1981. The mission was the sixth solely dedicated to a Department of 
Defense objective, NASA officials said. And it was the second shuttle flight 
this year, with seven more scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle Discovery is scheduled for an April 12 launch. Its mission is to 
place into orbit a $1.5-billion observatory designed to allow astronomers to 
study stars and galaxies so distant that their light has been traveling toward 
Earth for 14 billion years. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Creighton, a Navy captain, and Casper, an Air Force colonel, the 
crew for the Atlantis flight consisted of mission specialists Marine Lt. Col. 
David C. Hilmers, Air Force Col. Richard M. Mullane, and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Pierre 
J. Thuot. All but Casper and Thuot had been on previous shuttle flights.

<TEXT>
<P>
Although the unemployment rate is at a relatively low 5% and Gov. George 
Deukmejian is fond of declaring that California "is now an economic 
powerhouse," the state's primary welfare program is growing twice as fast as 
its overall population. 
</P>
<P>
The governor predicts that the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program 
will grow by 5.4% next year, in what has become a trend in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the biggest increases in welfare caseloads are occurring not in urban 
Los Angeles or even in most other major population centers, but in some of the 
state's inland rural areas, which can least afford the costs. 
</P>
<P>
As a cost-cutting device, Deukmejian is again proposing a one-year suspension 
of annual automatic cost-of-living increases for AFDC recipients. He notes that 
among the most populous states, California already provides the highest grants. 
</P>
<P>
But the Democratic-controlled Legislature has refused to withhold the increases 
and is expected to do so again. 
</P>
<P>
A typical AFDC family of four in the state receives a basic monthly cash grant 
of $824, excluding food stamps, medical or other benefits. The federal 
government provides 47.5% of the grant, the state 47.5% and counties 5%. 
</P>
<P>
No one claims to know for certain all the reasons for the expected increase in 
AFDC recipients, including Elizabeth G. Hill, the Legislature's nonpartisan 
budget expert whose task it is to make recommendations on major fiscal issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither the Department of Social Services, the Department of Finance nor us 
has been able to figure out at this point why the rate of increase in AFDC is 
so extensive," Hill said last month. 
</P>
<P>
But up and down California, welfare experts surveyed by The Times agreed that 
their burdens are growing. Despite rosy economic times, as one local official 
in a financially strapped county put it, the benefits have not "trickled down 
to us." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the current causes of public aid dependency include the increasing 
breakup of families that leave single mothers and children to fend alone, more 
teen-age pregnancy, more drug addictions and -- most frustrating of all -- more 
young people who quit school, can't get a job and turn to welfare for support. 
</P>
<P>
Poor immigrants to California, not only those from Mexico and Central America 
but, steadily since 1975, refugees from Southeast Asia, also draw welfare 
benefits. Although it is known to be substantial, the amount of assistance 
money received by immigrants compared to other recipients cannot be measured 
precisely. 
</P>
<P>
Poverty analysts, however, see a developing pattern of poor families 
increasingly fleeing from high-cost urban centers to less expensive housing in 
the country. This is true both of non-immigrant and immigrant families. 
</P>
<P>
One especially noticeable bulge is a second wave of Southeast Asian refugees 
moving to California from other states and what some analysts see as an 
emerging trend of refugees who are already here also resettling in the rural 
interior. Although the secondary migration of these refugees from other states 
was felt heaviest in 1979-83, state Department of Finance demographers say the 
flow has continued but at a slightly reduced pace. 
</P>
<P>
Many are drawn to the heavily agricultural Central Valley counties of Merced, 
Fresno and San Joaquin where frequently they join the AFDC rolls to help 
support their families. 
</P>
<P>
In Fresno County, for example, during the last eight years the average growth 
rate of recipients in the AFDC program has been nearly four times the rate of 
increase in the state's population. 
</P>
<P>
"In Fresno County, AFDC has gone completely out of sight," said Ernest 
Velasquez, the county's social welfare director, who said that his area long 
has been a beacon for immigrants fleeing Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
He said the caseload of Southeast Asian refugee families alone has soared from 
2,024 eight years ago to more than 5,000, many of them Hmongs. Refugee families 
have increased 148% and account for almost 16% of the AFDC caseload, county 
figures show. 
</P>
<P>
"Fresno is one of the last places in the state of California where housing is 
affordable," Velasquez said. "They feel they can make their grant stretch 
farther than they can in Los Angeles or San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
In nearby financially strapped Merced County, Southeast Asians total about 
12,000, about 8,000 of them AFDC recipients, welfare officials said. This is 
about 30% of the county caseload. 
</P>
<P>
"They do not have the survival skills that are needed to compete in a society 
where it took us 12 years through the schools system to learn these things," 
said welfare director John Cullen. "We are bringing a society into our society 
and you can't expect that to happen in a matter of months." 
</P>
<P>
The Hmong, industrious farmers from the Laotian highlands who were recruited as 
fighters by the CIA during the Vietnam War, are tightly knit by family and 
village elder ties. 
</P>
<P>
Although thousands of these villagers -- with limited experience in the modern 
world -- were scattered far and wide when they first reached the United States, 
by moving twice and sometimes three times, they have been regrouping in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
A new study by Department of Finance demographers shows that as of October, 
1988, 443,000 Southeast Asian refugees lived in California, a 9% increase over 
the previous year. Southeast Asians moving here from other states accounted for 
more than half of the increase. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that 25% of these refugees lived in Los Angeles County. Another 
62% lived in Fresno, San Joaquin, Sacramento, Alameda, Santa Clara, San 
Francisco, Orange and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
In the northern Sacramento Valley, officials report exploding increases in 
welfare families on the move. For instance, in almost-bankrupt Butte County, 
the AFDC rate shot up 12.3% last year. The increase is expected to slow to 7.9% 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like telling (people eligible for welfare) it is the land of milk and 
honey and they all showed up," said welfare director Margaret Mitzel of Butte 
County. "They tend to be able to survive on a welfare grant here a lot easier 
than in other places." 
</P>
<P>
In tiny Glenn County, another agriculture-based county with a population of 
about 25,000, about 800 families receive AFDC, an increase of about 130 cases 
over the last few years, said welfare director Susan Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago in Glenn County, she said, there were no Southeast Asians 
receiving AFDC. So, when a group of 72 Hmongs showed up recently and applied 
for welfare, "They had a very big impact." 
</P>
<P>
"I asked one man why he came here," Harris said, recalling that the man had 
indicated he was moving from the San Joaquin Valley. "He said he was driving up 
the road and liked it here. We have affordable housing." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, in such urban population centers as Los Angeles and booming Santa 
Clara counties, AFDC caseloads have remained almost stable for the last couple 
of years, sometimes falling behind the pace of the statewide growth in 
population. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, the AFDC rate fell in 1987 and again in 1988 but then 
rose to only 2.9% last year. There are many explanations, but some welfare 
analysts believe that Los Angeles may be the beneficiary of the movement out of 
high-cost areas. 
</P>
<P>
However, Eddie Tanaka, Los Angeles County director of public social services, 
notes that needy Southeast Asian and Mexican immigrants turned to public aid in 
Los Angeles County years ago, long before other counties were affected. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's really just that everyone else got started later than Los Angeles 
did," Tanaka said. "The big influxes hit us some time ago." 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Clara County, the migratory pattern is clearer, said Roger Cackler, 
county director of income maintenance. "Many of the (AFDC) families that 
otherwise might be here have left for the rural areas where the cost of housing 
may be less," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The AFDC rate for Santa Clara County, home of the Silicon Valley high-tech 
industry where housing is among the most costly in California, has remained 
about 1.4%, Cackler said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that even middle-class electronics employees seeking affordable 
housing have joined the rush inland to such San Joaquin Valley communities as 
Tracy, Modesto and Turlock. Some commute about 200 miles a day to and from 
Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But welfare officials in thriving Orange County said that despite high-cost 
housing they had not detected a pattern of AFDC families leaving to find less 
expensive shelter. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Orange County's overall welfare caseload has grown from 5% to 7% over 
the last four years. County welfare administrators attribute the increase 
chiefly to an aggressive "outreach" effort to find eligible recipients, 
application by larger families, the addition of more single women with children 
and the steady increase of Latino and Southeast Asian applicants. 
</P>
<P>
At a welfare office in Orange County, To Hocquyen Tang, 44, originally from 
Vietnam but now newly arrived from Ohio, recently stood with other refugees and 
applied for local general relief that would provide him with about $300 a 
month. He said he hopes to find work in a restaurant or grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
Tang said he found the Ohio climate too cold, other Asians too few and 
expressed hope that members of his family soon will move to California and 
"make a success." 
</P>
<P>
Although individual counties are able to report fluctuations in the welfare 
rolls, the state lacks detailed records on welfare families who are on the 
move. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have systems that are designed to fully understand what is happening 
in welfare," said Michael Genest, who analyzes welfare issues for the 
Legislature. "It is remarkable that in this computer age we don't know more." 
</P>
<P>
However, a report prepared for the state Senate Appropriations Committee and a 
committee that monitors implementation of Greater Avenues for Independence -- 
or GAIN, the state workfare program -- tends to support the theories of local 
welfare officials on why AFDC families pick up and move. 
</P>
<P>
Welfare recipients move for the same reasons as others -- "for jobs, more 
affordable housing and a better life in a new area," the report speculated, 
emphasizing that its investigation found "no direct clues." 
</P>
<P>
Many AFDC recipients appear to have seasonal jobs and go on welfare when the 
work ends, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the report suggested, some people who do not support themselves naturally 
remain on the move. "Migration behavior of (some) welfare recipients reflects a 
general lack of stability throughout their lives," the report said.

BOTTLED MESSAGE TRAVELS THE PACIFIC, REACHES PHILIPPINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA CHONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When radio talk show host Ross Olney began throwing bottled messages into the 
Pacific six years ago, he never dreamed that one would end up in the central 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Every whale-watching season since 1984, Olney -- the host of an afternoon news 
and entertainment show on radio station KVEN in Ventura -- tosses at least two 
marked wine bottles out into the waters of Southern California. The lucky 
finder of such a bottle wins a gift, which, in the past, has included water 
beds, diamond ring sets and stereo systems. 
</P>
<P>
"All the things that have happened in the world in the last four years, and 
this bottle has just been floating around!" said Olney, 60, of Ventura. "A 
little tiny bottle in that big ocean is very hard to find. This gives me some 
hope that some others have been found by others just as far away." 
</P>
<P>
The latest winner, Darwin Pena Randa, a fisherman from the Philippines, found 
the bottle in January and wrote a letter to Olney to claim his guaranteed prize 
-- a 35mm camera and 10 rolls of film. 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists told Olney that for the bottle to have arrived in the Surigao 
del Sur region of the Philippines, it must have traveled more than 10,000 miles 
along a Pacific tidal current. "It went past Washington, Alaska, the Aleutian 
Islands, just passed Russia, and came down to the Philippines," Olney said. 
</P>
<P>
The bottle included a letter on KVEN stationery and a personalized gift 
certificate typed by Olney. The directions told the finder to call the radio 
station collect to claim the prize, Olney said. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than a call, however, Olney earlier this year received a letter from 
Randa that read: "I am the founder of the lucky bottle. We found the bottle at 
the sea coz I am a fisher man," Olney said.

MANDELA CHEERED IN ZIMBABWE; AIDES CITE PACE, CUT HIS SCHEDULE

<P>
Black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela flew to Zimbabwe on Sunday on the 
second leg of a foreign tour, but aides concerned about his ability to maintain 
the grueling pace scaled back his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela received a red-carpet welcome from President Robert Mugabe, who hugged 
the recently freed prisoner as he stepped off a Zambian Airways flight from 
Lusaka. 
</P>
<P>
Mugabe then led him through a reception line that took nearly an hour to 
traverse. 
</P>
<P>
With a slow wave of his arm, Mandela, 71, silenced a cheering crowd of more 
than 3,000 well-wishers who turned out to greet him. He then delivered a 
15-minute address. 
</P>
<P>
The black nationalist has yet to enjoy a day off since his Feb. 11 release from 
27 years of imprisonment. He kept up a grueling schedule during his five days 
in Lusaka. 
</P>
<P>
From Harare, Mandela is scheduled to fly to Tanzania to visit ANC military 
training bases. Although no official changes have been announced, it appears 
that Mandela will then return to South Africa, cutting short his 17-day journey 
and delaying a visit with ailing ANC President Oliver Tambo in a Stockholm 
clinic.

SOUTHERN AFRICA: THOUSANDS CELEBRATE AFTER CISKEI'S PRESIDENT IS OUSTED.

<P>
Army troops in the troubled independent black homeland of Ciskei seized power 
in a bloodless coup before dawn Sunday, toppling President Lennox Sebe in a 
backlash over corruption and human rights abuses, the coup leader announced. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa pledged not to crush the rebellion as thousands of blacks spilled 
into the streets of the capital of Bisho to celebrate the ouster of the 
64-year-old Sebe, who has ruled with an iron hand since the territory accepted 
Pretoria's offer of independence in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists honked horns and armed soldiers guarding government buildings raised 
clenched fists in solidarity. Crowds chanting "Forward to freedom" and "Down 
with Sebe" swarmed the national stadium to hear the coup leader's announcement, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Troops maintained a generally low profile but fired shots in the air when mobs 
looted and burned shops near the main bus terminal, causing extensive damage, 
the witnesses said. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Brig. O. Josh Gqozo, the coup took place in the early hours Sunday, less 
than 48 hours after Sebe left the country, reportedly on a trade mission to 
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
There was widespread speculation in Bisho, however, that Sebe fled after 
learning of his imminent overthrow. His heavily fortified private palace 
appeared to have been abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
The defense force chief, his deputy and Sebe's son, Kwane, who headed an elite 
police unit, were detained, and Cabinet ministers were placed under house 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The military ruler of the nearby black homeland of Transkei said the coup dealt 
another blow to South Africa's homelands policy, which has stripped millions of 
blacks of South African citizenship since 1976 in a bid to relegate blacks to 
the role of migrant workers in South African cities and in rural gold and coal 
mines.

SUMMIT: TURNING A SPIRIT OF COOPERATION INTO ACTUAL ECONOMIC PROGRESS WILL 
LIKELY BE AN UPHILL FIGHT FOR U.S. AND JAPAN.

<TEXT>
<P>
Pledges by President Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu to inject 
new momentum into resolving their countries' trade frictions may dampen 
political tensions for a few months, but it remains to be seen whether they 
will herald a new era of U.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, government and 
private experts said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
To many analysts, Bush's strategy at the so-called Palm Springs summit -- 
actually held in nearby Rancho Mirage -- seemed to be an imaginative enough 
stroke: The United States would try to coax Japan into taking more serious 
steps to open its markets by offering in return the "wider say" Tokyo is 
seeking in international affairs, commensurate with its heightened economic 
clout. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides presumably would gain, and the two leaders would have prevented 
trade tensions from undermining their countries' broader relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased with this summit -- I like the feel of it afterwards," Bush 
exulted at a closing press conference Sunday before leaving Palm Springs for 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But the gambit also has involved some risks. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how good their intentions, neither Kaifu nor Bush will be able to 
deliver very easily on the pledges to which they have now staked themselves 
politically. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the narrower trade spats over satellites, supercomputers, forest 
products and the like, the United States is asking Kaifu to take on powerful 
special-interest groups and alter the very structure of his nation's business 
practices and consumer buying habits. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Bush's hope of transforming America from the free-spending, now 
mentality of the 1970s and '80s to a born-again, high-saving -- and 
quality-oriented -- international competitor is likely to be an uphill fight. 
Even cutting the budget deficit, so there will be more money available in the 
markets for private investment, is proving to be elusive. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, U.S. reaction to the California summit was mixed. In an appearance 
Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press," House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt 
(D-Mo.), who has been one of Bush's most vocal critics on trade issues, 
complained that the President did not go far enough to be very effective. He 
said Bush should have set specific goals for Japanese purchases of U.S. goods 
and then threatened to impose tariffs if those targets are not met. 
</P>
<P>
"How many of these press conferences have we heard before?" Gephardt asked, 
referring to the joint appearance by the two leaders Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Ed Lincoln, a Brookings Institution expert on Japan, said he 
thinks the Administration's effort was deftly handled. "Sure, it's something of 
a gamble, but the Administration will get more this way than they would with a 
(more threatening) stance," Lincoln said. "Whether they'll get enough to dampen 
the political frictions still is uncertain." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's major goal was to persuade the Japanese to move more 
aggressively to help ease trade tensions between the two countries. So far, 
Tokyo has refused to budge on U.S. complaints that it is unduly restricting 
imports on half a dozen individual products. And broader talks, designed to 
tackle more fundamental economic problems that may be contributing to the 
U.S.-Japanese trade imbalance, are faltering. 
</P>
<P>
Congress already is in an uproar, and the Administration is facing a series of 
deadlines for deciding whether to retaliate by imposing trade sanctions on 
Japan. That, in turn, could trigger a backlash in Japan, where voters already 
are resentful of the growing threats; many Japanese believe America has brought 
its economic problems on itself. 
</P>
<P>
The message Bush delivered to Kaifu was that his Administration, too, is 
anxious to move beyond the trade issue and build a broader "partnership" with 
Japan, but it will be hamstrung in that effort politically until the two sides 
can get their trade frictions ironed out. 
</P>
<P>
With Japan's governmental system so complex, it would take a concerted effort 
by Kaifu's ruling Liberal Democratic Party to provide the political push needed 
to persuade voters -- and Japan's semi-independent ministries and bureaucrats 
-- to begin opening the country's markets. 
</P>
<P>
"To take the political decisions from the top" is the way Bush phrased it 
during private sessions with Kaifu. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's offer to bring Japan in as a major player in important international 
economic and political decisions was not an idle one. For all their friction on 
trade issues, U.S. officials pointed out that the two countries share common 
views on many issues, from Soviet relations to drug interdiction, and could be 
a formidable force if they worked more closely together. 
</P>
<P>
And cash-rich Japan already is stepping into the role that the United States 
played in the late 1940s. It is financing aid to Panama and Nicaragua and 
helping with Mexico's debt-reduction plan and with the recovery in Eastern 
Europe.

SHAMIR BALKS AT PRESSURE FOR EARLY DECISION ON MEETING PALESTINIANS

Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Sunday rejected domestic and U.S. 
pressure for a quick decision on opening historic talks with Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers of Shamir's rightist Likud Party rebelled publicly against a 
U.S. call for Israel finally to make a decision, and leaders of its Labor 
coalition partner were split on whether to extend a Wednesday deadline they 
have set. 
</P>
<P>
"We are discussing now these proposals and these plans concerning our peace 
process, and after we will end all these discussions, we will take a decision," 
Shamir told reporters. "It is hard to say if it will be this week or later." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's comments and the open battle inside Likud undermined earlier reports 
that the prime minister was ready to approve Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo 
on implementing his initiative for elections in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Shimon Peres has insisted that the government decide on its 
response to the U.S. proposals by Wednesday, but Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin 
said the decision could wait until early next week. 
</P>
<P>
In remarks bound to further strain relations with the United States, Shamir 
said the government will continue to direct Soviet Jewish immigrants to 
Jerusalem, including Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem. The United States opposes 
such a policy. 
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning his name, Shamir criticized President Bush for saying there 
should be no new settlements in East Jerusalem, captured in the 1967 Middle 
East War.

A majority of elementary schools begin drug education in kindergarten, and most 
also have programs to discuss AIDS and sex education, a survey showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Elementary School Principals poll of 556 educators found 
drug education existed in 95% of the schools, compared to 88% in a 1987 survey. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight percent of schools began drug education in kindergarten, 30% by 
third grade and 12% between fourth and sixth grade, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-six percent of the principals agreed that AIDS education should be part 
of the elementary school curriculum, but only 63% said they had an AIDS 
program.

BUSH PRAISES ANNENBERG EDUCATION DONATION

With President Bush presiding at a brief ceremony, publishing magnate and 
former ambassador Walter H. Annenberg kicked off a $250-million fund-raising 
campaign for the United Negro College Fund by officially unveiling a 
$50-million personal donation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an important effort. It's a noble effort," Bush said. "And our mission 
must be to strengthen our historically black colleges and universities to meet 
the challenges of the 21st Century," he added, observing that the colleges make 
up about 3% of America's colleges but enroll about 20% of all black college and 
university students. 
</P>
<P>
Annenberg's gift, which became known on Friday, is the largest single donation 
ever to black higher education in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
David F. Demarest, White House communications director, said Bush's weekend 
visit to Annenberg's estate in nearby Rancho Mirage was planned before the 
donation announcement was scheduled. Nevertheless, it lent the prestige of the 
White House to the effort and tied Bush to a major black cause at a time when 
the Republican Party is trying to attract black support. 
</P>
<P>
Annenberg, 82, former owner of TV Guide and other publications and President 
Richard M. Nixon's ambassador to Britain, said during the program that "it is 
the obligation, the responsibility of those who have been fortunate in life to 
support those who are less fortunate. And if you don't understand that, you're 
not very much of the citizen." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Annenberg told reporters: "It is psychologically important that blacks 
indicate to the rest of the population in the country that they have the 
capacity to teach and serve. If one segment of the people is behind other 
segments of the population, you obviously have a very unwholesome citizenry in 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain his remark, he said: "The record would explain that. The 
record of excellence that blacks have achieved on an individual basis -- George 
Washington Carver, there are any number of blacks with tremendous records." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Christopher Edley, president of the fund, positioned himself in 
front of television cameras and steered Annenberg away, telling reporters: 
"We've limited the questions. I'm sorry, sir." 
</P>
<P>
Edley described the Annenberg gift, which will be phased in over five to 10 
years, as "a launching pad" to "capture the imagination of the nation (and) the 
foundations, the corporations, other wealthy individuals who can make a 
difference."

Williams' self-assurance is easy to understand, given the phenomenal progress 
of his candidacy. Spending nearly $5 million -- most of it his own money -- in 
just five months, this 58-year-old tycoon has transformed himself from a 
political unknown into the far-out front-runner in the March 13 GOP 
gubernatorial primary race. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, with the Democratic campaign blurred by bickering and bungling -- 
not to mention unanswered questions about drug use by one of the candidates -- 
Williams is the early favorite to succeed Gov. Bill Clements next November and 
keep the governor's office of the third most populous state in Republican 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the star of the governor's race," conceded Jack Martin, top political 
operative here for Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.). "Everything else is Pablum." 
</P>
<P>
Williams promises to restore prosperity to Texas by applying the hard-headed 
business management skills he demonstrated in ramrodding his ventures in 
ranching, oil, gas, banking and telecommunications through the dark years of 
the energy bust. 
</P>
<P>
Williams offers voters his own travails and triumphs in the business world as a 
paradigm for the state. When oil prices were booming, he says, "I was 6 foot 4. 
Now I'm only 4 foot 6, but I'm still drilling wells." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Claytie Williams, as he likes to be called, stands about 5 feet 8 
and, with his jug ears and prominent nose, resembles his hero, movie star John 
Wayne, less than chicken purveyor Frank Perdue. What counts, Williams claims, 
is not how he looks, but what he has achieved in the face of adversity. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done what it took to do to make it," he says. "I have a record of 
survival, and I want to take the survival skills that I have learned in 
business and make Texas government better, not bigger." 
</P>
<P>
Before he gets a chance to prove his theory, Williams will be tested on the 
March 13 ballot against three major rivals -- Kent Hance, a railroad 
commissioner and former congressman who is trying to appeal to conservatives by 
pledging to push through a ban on a state income tax, Jack Rains, a former 
secretary of state who boasts of his experience in both government and 
business, and Tom Luce, lawyer and protege of the legendary entrepreneur H. 
Ross Perot and the favorite of many upper-income, upper-IQ Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
About the only question for Williams now is whether he can get more than 50% of 
the votes and avoid a runoff with one of his rivals -- who say that such a 
confrontation will give them the chance to probe for Williams' so far unexposed 
vulnerabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"When there are just two of us in the race, he's going to have to talk about 
the issues," Rains said in an interview after last week's debate. Complaining 
that he has minimized substance while emphasizing the emotional and values that 
appeal to "good-old-boy" Texans and their wives, Raines said of Williams: "He's 
playing to the 'Bubba vote.' " 
</P>
<P>
Told about that charge, Williams was unfazed. "I am Bubba," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who says he was drawn into politics by the discovery that his 
teen-age son had become dependent on beer and marijuana, has exhibited a flair 
for appealing to the values that motivate many voters here in Texas, and 
elsewhere, too, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most notable example of his style is a much-discussed television 
spot about his plan for the "war on drugs." The 30-second spot depicts a group 
of convicts swinging sledge hammers as Williams warns repeat drug offenders 
that he will "introduce them to the joys of bustin' rocks." That phrase, which 
has caught the imagination of the public, was Williams' own invention, his 
aides say. 
</P>
<P>
As the outlines of the Republican race have become clear, the Democratic 
contest seems to have gotten murkier. One reason, local Democrats concede, is a 
problem that also clouds their party's prospects nationally: Democratic 
candidates are reluctant to stress specific proposals for programs and policies 
for fear that voters will get the idea they are planning to raise taxes to pay 
for them. Texans' resistance to taxes is evidenced by the fact theirs is one of 
only eight states without an income tax. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the biggest disappointment in the Democratic field is state Treasurer 
Ann Richards, the early front-runner. She gained national recognition with her 
quip, during her keynote speech to the 1988 Democratic convention, that George 
Bush was "born with a silver foot in his mouth." 
</P>
<P>
In this campaign, though, Richards appears to have put her own foot in her 
mouth. When she answered a question on abortion during a televised debate last 
month, most people thought they heard her say that no government official had 
any right to decide "whether a white woman has an abortion or not." 
</P>
<P>
Though even her opponents have absolved Richards on the question of racism, she 
has spent so much time denying, then rationalizing that slip and another one 
(that, years ago, she referred to illegal aliens as "wetbacks") that it seems 
to have undermined her candidacy. Recent polls show her slipping into a tie 
with former Gov. Mark White. 
</P>
<P>
Some politicians here expect Richardson's popularity to drop even further as a 
result of the Democratic campaign debate that followed the Republicans' 
confrontation last week. Richards, who acknowledges that she is a recovering 
alcoholic, refused to give a yes or no response when a reporter asked her if 
she had ever used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In the most dramatic moment of the debate, she said that a direct answer to 
that question would send "a very sad message to people who need help: That they 
will forever bear, regardless of what their addiction is, questions about 
whether or not they are fit to serve and whether they are recovered." 
</P>
<P>
The third Democrat in the race, Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox, immediately pounced on 
Richards. Urging her to clear up her stand on the drugs issue, Mattox said: "It 
has become the biggest question of this campaign." If Richards should become 
the party's gubernatorial nominee, Mattox warned, "the Republicans will not be 
this gentle. Clayton Williams will do more than bust rocks. He'll bust our 
party." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both White and Mattox seem to be in a competition mainly for rural 
voters, in which each is trying to appear tougher than the other, particularly 
when it comes to crime. First, Mattox aired a commercial in which he boasted 
that 32 executions have been carried out during his tenure as attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
Then White, the former governor, indignantly protested that "the governor has a 
lot more to do with the business of executions than the attorney general does." 
To dramatize that point, his campaign aired an ad showing White walking down a 
corridor lined with photos of executed criminals, with White saying: "As 
governor, I made sure they received the ultimate penalty -- death. And Texas is 
a safer place for it." 
</P>
<P>
For all the squabbling over who is tougher, the experience of the incumbent, 
Republican Clements, demonstrates that machismo alone cannot guarantee 
political success. Clements decided not to seek reelection because many voters 
are put off by his abrasive style. Many also believe that he lied when he 
denied knowledge of payments made to Southern Methodist University football 
players while he was chairman of the university's board of trustees after his 
first term as governor ended in 1982.

A strike at 11 major Hawaii hotels is expected to drag on for at least a week, 
and replacement workers are being flown to the islands to make beds and meals 
for thousands of tourists. 
</P>
<P>
"We're prepared to operate for weeks if need be," said William Crawford, 
executive director of the Council of Hawaii Hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Contract talks between the council and the Hotel Employees and Restaurant 
Employees Union broke off Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I saved all year for this vacation, and I want my bed made," said Cindy 
Parisi, 23, who is paying $275 a night at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. 
</P>
<P>
Room service was suspended at most hotels, some restaurants were closed and 
supervisors scrambled to check in guests and clean rooms Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Federal mediator Frank Schoeppel predicted Sunday it would be "at least a week" 
before any new talks are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
About 7,500 workers are on strike in the dispute over a wage and benefit 
package. The walkout affects 9,300 rooms in Waikiki and at three hotels on 
other islands, about 16% of the state's total hotel inventory. It is the first 
major strike in 24 years in Waikiki. 
</P>
<P>
The hotels involved in the strike on Oahu are the Hawaiian Village, the Hyatt 
Regency Waikiki, the Ilikai, the Kahala Hilton, the Sheraton Waikiki, the 
Sheraton Moana Surfrider, the Princess Kaiulani and the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. 
On the neighbor islands, the Sheraton Kauai, Sheraton Maui and Kona Hilton are 
also struck. 
</P>
<P>
Management said it offered a 7% annual increase in wages and benefits, but the 
union said the offer was worth only 5.5%. The union is asking for a 10% hike.

MIKE DOWNEY: HE DIDN'T RECEIVE A FIGHTING CHANCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Six days after Hank Gathers buckled and fainted at the free-throw line of a 
December college basketball game, I waited for him to keep an appointment in a 
lonely corner of Loyola Marymount's basketball pavilion. He wandered in a 
little late, a little woozy, a little wobbly, I thought. He did not look good. 
He looked listless. 
</P>
<P>
"How are you feeling?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that what we're going to talk about?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Hank was longing to get back to shooting hoops. A doctor had tested and tested 
him, X-rayed and examined him, taken his blood pressure and pulse, aimed a 
penlight beam into his eyes, monitored his heartbeat. He seemed OK. He felt OK. 
Loyola had basketball dates the following week with Oregon State and Oklahoma, 
so naturally, Hank Gathers was dying to play. 
</P>
<P>
Was dying to play. 
</P>
<P>
Was dying to play. 
</P>
<P>
He gave me a shrug that day and said: "The doc's got a job to do. If he clears 
me to play basketball, and then I go out there and collapse again, he'd better 
be able to show that he ran every test there was on me." 
</P>
<P>
Go out there and collapse again. 
</P>
<P>
Go out there and collapse again. 
</P>
<P>
More than two months have passed. It is a bone-chilling Sunday in the 
California oceanside community of Marina del Rey, where yacht brokerages dot 
the main boulevard, where boat sails flap from the channel's evening breeze. A 
nearby hospital has just ushered into its emergency room a handsome young man, 
a young man who three weeks before had celebrated his 23rd birthday, a young 
man who three weeks hence hoped to be celebrating a surprise ending to his 
senior year. 
</P>
<P>
A regional championship. A national championship. A way to one-better the 
staggering individual accomplishment of the year before, when Gathers led every 
young man in the land not only in scoring, but in rebounding as well. And as 
long as Hank and this season's No. 1 scorer, Bo Kimble, could step onto a gym 
floor together, championships seemed eminently possible. Anything seemed 
possible. The NBA. Glory. Money. Everything was possible, because Hank Gathers 
had his entire life ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
His entire life ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
His entire life ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
He wanted to be a sportscaster. He went to a camp, learned the tricks of the 
trade, interned at a local TV station, took over the host's role on a local 
cable channel's Loyola pregame show. He wanted to learn how to interview and be 
interviewed. He asked for advice. He listened politely, thoughtfully. He asked 
me: "Did I give you a good interview, or was I dull?" 
</P>
<P>
A week went by. Two weeks. Hank's trigger finger got itchy. In practice he shot 
baskets, felt fine. For the Oklahoma game he suited up, ran through the lay-up 
drills, pumped a couple of jumpers, even though he understood that the Loyola 
coach was not about to let him play. All night long I stole glances at him, 
leaning forward from his courtside chair, wiping his sweaty palms. It was all 
he could do not to make a plea to Paul Westhead to put him in the game. 
</P>
<P>
In days to come, when he finally did return, Hank seemed good as new. No 
lingering aftereffects. He lit up St. Mary's for 44 points. Bo Kimble, his 
buddy from the cracked schoolyard asphalt of Philadelphia to the clean, green 
playgrounds of the West Coast, thought Hank looked like, well, Hank. He talked 
about a day in the NBA when he, Bo, hoped to compete in the All-Star game's 
three-point shooting contest, but not in the dunking contest. "I'll leave that 
one for Hank," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Leave that one for Hank. 
</P>
<P>
Leave that one for Hank. 
</P>
<P>
A March afternoon. A day like any other day. A basketball game. Hank Gathers in 
a silvery uniform, brow beaded with sweat, hands steady under pressure. He 
backpedals. He swoons. His legs crumple beneath him, and he tips over, topples 
like a fallen oak. Prostrate on the court. Trembling. Having a seizure. He 
tries to rise. He's confused. He slumps backward a second time. His leg is 
rising involuntarily, is twitching uncontrollably. 
</P>
<P>
A March evening. A hospital like any other hospital. Five minutes before 7 
o'clock. A young man, a handsome and articulate young man, a gifted and 
engaging young man, an indecently unlucky young man, has passed away. An 
attending physician, Dr. Mason Weiss, relates how resuscitative measures were 
taken, how "with somebody in his physical shape," at least a fighting chance 
remained of reviving Hank Gathers. 
</P>
<P>
"Much to everybody's chagrin," Dr. Weiss said, "there was never any evidence of 
spontaneous heart activity that we could measure on a heart monitor." 
</P>
<P>
Much to everybody's chagrin. 
</P>
<P>
Much to everybody's chagrin. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Gathers, gone. Taken away, by the unforgiving beeping of a monitor, by the 
uneven beating of a heart. I can still see him falling, falling, falling. Tell 
me he's going to be OK. Tell me they can run more tests. Tell me anything at 
all, anything except the terrible thing you keep telling me.

ORTIZ DOESN'T REPEAT ERROR, WINS L.A. RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canadian Peter Fonseca, running in his first marathon, found himself in a pack 
of three runners leading the race with only one mile to go in Sunday's Los 
Angeles Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
Alongside Fonseca, 23, were two men who were a decade older and had run scores 
of world-class marathons. Suddenly, the men began to run with almost wild 
abandon, sprinting hard after running 25 miles. 
</P>
<P>
It was a pivotal moment for Fonseca, and a telling moment, too. For in 
marathons, as in life, experience is the best teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Fonseca lacked only an education Sunday, and was left to watch ruefully as 
Pedro Ortiz of Colombia and Toni Niemczak of Poland swiftly pulled away in what 
would be the race's turning point. Ortiz was the swifter, winning in 2 hours 11 
minutes 54 seconds on a damp and cloudy day -- ideal marathon conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cool weather, however, one runner died in the race. William 
McKinney, 59, of Altadena was pronounced dead at Midway Hospital after 
suffering a heart attack at mile 21, race officials said. It was the first 
death in the five runnings of the marathon. 
</P>
<P>
Experience was the winner and vindication was its inspiration for some runners 
Sunday. Each race had its own story. 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz ran hard, as if to distance himself from last year's miscalculation that 
saw him place second by only 27 seconds. Niemczak, who was second Sunday in 
2:12:05, has been struggling to erase the tarnish of a drug suspension that 
kept him out of the 1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
For the women's winner, Julie Isphording of Cincinnati (2:32:25), it was a 
triumph over a similar L.A. course upon which she suffered a torn tendon in her 
right foot and dropped out after 11 miles of the 1984 Olympic marathon. 
</P>
<P>
And in a cruel twist on the same theme, experience has taught this: not to pay 
any mind if Sylvia Mosqueda, formerly of Cal State L.A., dashes to the front 
and leads a marathon, for she is sure to wither and drop out. Which Mosqueda 
did again Sunday after running at a world-record pace for 10 miles before 
disappearing somewhere around 17 miles. 
</P>
<P>
As always, this race was a microcosm of the city itself -- democratic and 
diverse -- with every oddball and zealot free to get on the line with the fit 
and the fanatic. And it was a perfect day for running 26.2 miles through city 
streets. Temperatures were in the 50s for the start and a light early-morning 
rain had sputtered out by the time a cannon was fired to start the race up 
Figueroa. 
</P>
<P>
As some 18,918 entrants -- exactly one more than last year -- streamed by the 
starting platform where Muhammad Ali stood, hundreds chanted 'Ali, Ali' as the 
three-time world heavyweight champion blew kisses to the runners. 
</P>
<P>
In the masses could be found the usual assortment of first-time runners and 
veterans carrying ribald signs and wearing leftover Mardi Gras outfits: one man 
ran in the black road uniform of the Kings' Wayne Gretzky, complete with 
regulation NHL helmet. How times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
The early pace among the elite runners was conservative and cautious as the 
race wound its way in twists and turns out of the downtown area and onto the 
long straight shot along Sunset Blvd., bound for the west side. The men stayed 
in a pack that fluctuated from a dozen to 18 until the 15th mile. There, Ortiz, 
Niemczak, Fonseca, Mark Plaatjes and four others pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
On through streets puddled with standing water the pack chugged. Ortiz ran at 
the front with a steely confidence, often glancing about him to assess his 
competitors. With him was Plaatjes, the former South African who had run here 
twice but had been thwarted by fate. Niemczak ran strongly beside Fonseca, who 
was content to sit at the back of the group and watch what unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
Or unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
It began at the 21st mile. Plaatjes began to fade and eventually lost contact 
with the first three. He would finish fourth in 2:13:44, saying later he felt 
flat, at a loss to explain or even describe his sense of staleness. 
</P>
<P>
By the 25th mile, Ortiz, Niemczak and Fonseca were still bunched tightly, not a 
common sight late in a marathon. What happened next was downright rare. Ortiz 
went first, sprinting in earnest, and, after a beat, Niemczak responded. 
Fonseca appeared to debate his next move. It proved to be a costly delay. 
</P>
<P>
"When they blasted off, I thought if I go with it and go crazy, I thought I 
would be paralyzed on the road," Fonseca said. "I was scared, I'll admit it. I 
was real apprehensive to go with these guys. I thought if I died I would look 
like an idiot. I decided to hang back and just play the game." 
</P>
<P>
It was no game to Ortiz, who relaxed only after the race. The Colombian has 
felt snubbed by this race, having placed 10th in 1988, then not receiving an 
invitation to the elite field for last year's race. Eager to make a point, 
Ortiz finished second last year, but said he erred in not going out fast enough 
to catch winner Art Boileau. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be in control of the race," Ortiz said. "If anyone was going to 
go, I wanted to go with him." 
</P>
<P>
Only Niemczak could go with Ortiz. Niemczak, who trains in Alamosa, Colo., has 
placed second in his last four marathons since returning from a drug 
suspension. The Polish runner tested positive for anabolic steroids after 
placing second in the 1986 New York City marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"I am always a runner-up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ortiz and Isphording each won $26,385 and a Mercedes Benz. 
</P>
<P>
Isphording was content to let Mosqueda go out out fast. "She's known to do 
that; I went out there to run my own race," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mosqueda faded at the 11th mile and Sirje Eichelmann of the Soviet Union took 
the lead, which she retained for the next eleven miles. Behind her were the 
patient Isphording and then Lizanne Bussieres of Canada, who was third in 
2:33:44. 
</P>
<P>
Isphording passed Eichelmann at 22 1/2 miles, going by the Soviet, who didn't 
appear to notice. Seconds later Eichelmann made a run at Isphording, but it 
wasn't enough. She was second in 2:33:36. 
</P>
<P>
"At mile 20 I was going to give whatever I had left, it just so happened that 
they were beginning to die," Isphording said. 
</P>
<P>
Although she failed in her attempt to break 2:30, the barrier that 
distinguishes the world-class women, Isphording was happy to win in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"I dropped out of the Olympics here in 1984," she said. "I did get my second 
chance out here. This race means a lot for me to win for that reason." 
</P>
<P>
Fonseca, who trains with Boileau in Eugene, Ore., can say he lived and learned 
after his first marathon. It took all of Boileau's convincing to get Fonseca to 
even enter here. Having done it, he's sure he will do it again. But not merely 
for the experience. 
</P>
<P>
Since he competes on the University of Oregon track team, under NCAA rules 
Fonseca would not be allowed to keep his $4,000 in prize money. Fonseca, lured 
by his surprising success, announced he would henceforth forsake his collegiate 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I love being a Duck, but I am going to take the money," he said.

BECKER WOULD LIKE WEST GERMANS TO KEEP HIS TENNIS IN PERSPECTIVE

"Is Everybody Crazy?" 
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker, top-seeded in the $1 million Newsweek Champions Cup that begins 
today, asked that question in a unique article he wrote that appeared recently 
in the West German magazine Der Spiegel. 
</P>
<P>
In the article, Becker questioned his status as a national hero and the 
controversy after he announced he will not play Davis Cup for West Germany this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Becker was watching television at his home in Leimen, West Germany, when two 
headlines appeared on the screen. One was that the German Democratic Republic 
has elections March 18. The other was that he is not going to play for the West 
German team in a first-round Davis Cup match against Holland. 
</P>
<P>
"What am I now that these two headlines are mentioned at the same time?" Becker 
asked. "Is everybody crazy?" 
</P>
<P>
Becker, who has set his sights on moving up from his No. 2 ranking to No. 1, 
went on to say that he is uncomfortable with the notion that he alone 
represents West German tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Coming off a victory over No. 1 Ivan Lendl in the final of the Stuttgart 
Classic, Becker will get a first-round bye in the Newsweek. He will play the 
winner of a first-round match between Jim Grabb and Javier Sanchez.

JORDAN SEEKING ORDER AMID CHAOS OF ATP; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: THE MEN'S GAME IS HEALTHY, MORE WEALTHY THAN EVER, HE CLAIMS. BUT

Last week, when Hamilton Jordan visited the Grand Canyon and peered into the 
great abyss, he may have felt himself in familiar surroundings. He already knew 
a thing or two about chasms. 
</P>
<P>
As the leader of the ATP Tour, which began 18 months ago with an announcement 
in a parking lot at the U.S. Open, he has become something of a moving target. 
</P>
<P>
At a tournament in Toronto, John McEnroe says Jordan is a politician who knows 
nothing about tennis. Ivan Lendl likens the new tour to the overthrown 
Czechoslovakian regime. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the stolid International Tennis Federation schedules a season-ending 
tournament in West Germany with more prize money and only three weeks later 
than the tour's season-ending tournament in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the New York Times runs a first-person article written by former 
ATP executive director Bob Briner. The story's headline: "The ATP Tour Is a 
Mess. Big Surprise." 
</P>
<P>
There are breaking news reports that Jordan is stepping down from his post amid 
the squabbling. 
</P>
<P>
Against such a backdrop, Jordan urges calm. The ATP Tour, barely two months 
old, has discovered some problems, Jordan admits, but he says men's tennis is 
better than it has ever been. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been kind of every man for himself, every tournament for itself 
and ever player for himself," Jordan said. "That's why what we are attempting 
to do is so difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going against the grain of a lot of years of people saying 'I've got to 
look out for myself and the hell with everybody else.' I'll tell you today, 
we've been successful. But the real test is five years from now, whether we've 
made a difference." 
</P>
<P>
As the leading figure of the establishment that is men's pro tennis, Jordan 
said he expects such criticism as he received from McEnroe and Lendl as part of 
the territory. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm human . . . I don't like for anybody to criticize me, but it hasn't had 
any effect on me," Jordan said. "I've had a lot worse than that." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan confirmed that his replacement as chief executive officer of the new 
tour is being sought, and that he may move to a position on the tour's board. 
But he said he is not leaving because of any criticism leveled at him. 
</P>
<P>
"Professionally that concerns me because I don't want it to appear . . . no, 
I'm not going to be chased out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's contract with the ATP runs until the end of 1991 at a reported 
$450,000 a year. The New York headhunting firm of Russell, Reynolds &amp; 
Associates, which is conducting the search, has apparently already produced at 
least two candidates. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources, they are Mark Miles, director of the U.S. Men's Hardcourt 
Championships in Indianapolis, and Jerry Solomon of executive vice president of 
ProServ. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who would not comment on a possible successor, said it has always been 
his intention to leave the day-to-day affairs of the men's tour at some point. 
</P>
<P>
"The board tried to get me to extend my contract about a year ago and I said 
I'd be willing to serve out (his contract) on the board, but once this thing is 
up and running, I'd want to bring somebody in and train them," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
"And with the board's approval, of course, at some point turn over the 
day-to-day management of the tour to him," he said. "That's where we are now. 
We are looking for someone to do that. I'll be around for another couple of 
years. I'm not going to walk away from it." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, with new title sponsor IBM on board, the ATP Tour released a study 
of prize money that indicated the players are making more money this year than 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
According to the ATP's figures, Lendl's winnings for January and February 
totaled $530,937 compared to $208,973 at the same time last year. Of the top 
250 players in the money rankings, each showed an increase in prize money 
winnings. 
</P>
<P>
"Money was never the primary motivations for starting the new tour, but that's 
some indication of the success of what we've done as a business," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan also pointed to the ATP Tour's television package, its upcoming 
highlight show and the planned ATP University for young pros as examples of 
what the new tour has accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that after two months, we're probably where we expected to be," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the criticism from players, Jordan said he sees nothing to be gained 
from debating the merits of their comments in the press. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when I came into this job, I was on a steep learning curve," he said. 
"It took some time. And I'll never be able to look at the sport from the 
perspective of McEnroe, somebody who's been out there playing. 
</P>
<P>
"The upside is, I hope I've brought some skills to the table from outside 
tennis that have helped. There's no way to satisfy all these guys. There have 
been some complaints. That's almost inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
The former chief of staff during Jimmy Carter's presidency, Jordan has been 
linked to a group of investors interested in attracting an NFL franchise to 
Jacksonville, Fla., although Jordan would not comment on his future plans. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever they might be, he cannot forget what he has learned from politics 
and the politics of tennis. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in tennis are more devious," Jordan said. "In politics, people look 
you in the eye. They deal straightforward with you. 
</P>
<P>
"Tennis, it's very Byzantine. You have guys telling you one thing one day, and 
they do something differently the next."

BADID, WHEELCHAIR CHAMPION, LIKENS L.A. COURSE TO BOSTON'S

<P>
Moustapha Badid of France has been described as the most powerful wheelchair 
racer in the world. He lived up to that accolade Sunday at the Los Angeles 
Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
Badid, 24, moved ahead of the field at the start and kept pulling away, winning 
in 1 hour 45 minutes 40 seconds -- almost seven minutes ahead of the 
second-place finisher, Canada's Andre Viger. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Cody-Morris of Urbana, Ill., was the women's winner in 2:03.50. Candace 
Cable-Brooks, a four-time winner here, did not enter this year's race. 
</P>
<P>
Badid, an Algerian who lives in St. Denis, France, near Paris, has been 
disabled since birth. 
</P>
<P>
A former world record-holder as a wheelchair racer, Badid has been the guest in 
Los Angeles of Jim Knaub, who won the race last year. 
</P>
<P>
Badid said that he and Knaub started out together, but that Knaub had to drop 
out after about a half mile. Knaub is suffering from a rib injury. 
</P>
<P>
Badid won the wheelchair division of the Boston Marathon in 1988. Comparing the 
Boston course to Sunday's, Badid said, "The road is much rougher here and the 
hills are just as difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Molinatti, the wheelchair division coordinator and two-time winner of the 
race, said there were 106 entries, a record for such a competition in the 
United States. MAL FLORENCE

HE KEEPS PACE DESPITE 1985 HEART ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Elvin Pam ran with his son, Aaron, for a while Sunday in the Los Angeles 
Marathon and then they walked to the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
It was Aaron's first marathon and, when he tired at the 21-mile mark, he told 
his father to go on ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pam insisted that they finish together and they did, in about 5 hours 
and 33 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Pam, the supervisor of the psychology department at the Bronx, 
N.Y., Psychiatric Center, is running at all is somewhat amazing. 
</P>
<P>
He received a rate-responsive pacemaker in November of 1985 at 50. He had 
suffered a heart attack that damaged the sinal node of his heart, which 
regulates the beat. 
</P>
<P>
The pacemaker he received was somewhat in the experimental stage. The standard 
fixed rate pacemaker is programmed for 70 beats to a minute, Pam said. 
</P>
<P>
"With that type of pacemaker, I wouldn't have been able run, or do any heavy 
exercise," Pam said. "I would have to lead a sedentary life." 
</P>
<P>
His personal physician, Dr. Dennis Miura, advised him to accept the variable 
rate pacemaker and encouraged him to run again. 
</P>
<P>
"The pacemaker I have changes the heart beat according to muscle tension in the 
chest," Pam said. "It has a low of 60 beats on up to 150." 
</P>
<P>
Pam decided to run in the New York Marathon in 1988, much to the dismay of his 
family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to keep it a secret, but they found out and thought I was going to 
kill myself," Pam said, adding that he didn't want to be treated like an 
invalid. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did Pam run, but he finished in 5 hours 29 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
His family was waiting for him at the 21-mile mark, but they got there too 
late. Pam had passed that point earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Pam said that the pacemaker he has is more sensitive to a runner's needs and he 
plans to keep on running. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron, his 23-year-old son, isn't sure that he wants to run with with his 
father again. As a pacemaker, he is too fast. 
</P>
<P>
Horacio Pino, 23, and Valerie French, 27, ran together Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
They finished in about 4 hours 23 minutes and Pino, a sergeant in the Marine 
Corp, had a surprise waiting for French at the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
He proposed to her. She accepted. 
</P>
<P>
It was French's first marathon and Pino was concerned that his plans might have 
been spoiled if she had dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
They met last summer in Okinawa, where Pino was stationed and French, from 
England, was teaching English to Japanese students. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked running and she liked running and that's how we got to know each 
other," Pino said. 
</P>
<P>
The Orthopedic Medical Center near the finish line of the marathon looked 
something like a M*A*S*H unit Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Some runners were totally exhausted, other could hardly walk because their legs 
were cramped and many suffered from dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
It was a similar scene inside the Sports Arena, where runners leaned against 
walls, or were lying on the floor. The odor of lineament was stifling. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sonny Cobble, the medical commissioner for the marathon, said that some 
runners don't drink enough water on the 26-mile run, leading to dehydration and 
sometimes hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
Some runners were competing in their first marathon, such as Ken Ernst, 28, a 
former long-distance runner for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Ernst said he has four brothers, all of whom have run in marathons, and they 
goaded him into competing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my first and last marathon," said Ernst, who limped down some stairs at 
the Sports Arena, his legs cramping and his feet blistered. "It was like 
someone took a sledge hammer to the bottoms of my feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be easier than it was and I was actually delirious at about 
14 miles, but I was determined to finish." 
</P>
<P>
He finished in about 2 hours 51 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Art Boileau and Peter Fonseca, both Canadians, train together in Eugene, Ore. 
Boileau is a two-winner of the L.A. marathon and he urged Fonseca to compete 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Fonseca, who runs for the University of Oregon, agreed to accommodate his 
friend, even though the marathon was a new experience for him. 
</P>
<P>
Fonseca surprised himself by finishing third. 
</P>
<P>
Boileau, who finished fifth, said that he and Fonseca had an interesting week 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw the Edmonton-Kings game Wednesday night, got to see Wayne Gretzky, we 
had an earthquake and we got to run in a marathon," Boileau said.

L.A. VICTORY IS DOUBLY SPECIAL;

WOMEN'S RACE: ISPHORDING OVERCOMES SEVERE BACK INJURY -- AND ERASES PAINFUL 
MEMORY OF 1984 OLYMPICS.

Julie Isphording flashed a wide smile as she crossed the finish line as the top 
female finisher in the fifth Los Angeles Marathon Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Isphording had every reason to smile. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors told Isphording that she might never walk again, let alone run, after 
she underwent back surgery to repair a ruptured disc in April of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know how it (the ruptured disc) happened," she said. "It wasn't 
like I was taking out the trash and I felt it go. It paralyzed me. I had no 
feeling in my right leg. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of doubts whether I'd be able to run again. Basically, I went into 
surgery hoping I'd be able to walk without pain. I was willing to sacrifice my 
running just to walk again normally." 
</P>
<P>
But she didn't have to make the sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
After a four-month layoff, Isphording began running. She returned to marathon 
running the next year, finishing ninth in the trials for the 1988 Olympic 
Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
Isphording, who dreaded the drudgery of workouts, found a new appreciation for 
running after she recovered and began training again. 
</P>
<P>
"Surgery made me just appreciate running more," she said. "When something's 
taken away from you, you learn not to take it for granted." 
</P>
<P>
Isphording has overcome her back injury to win three marathons, including the 
Columbus, Ohio, Marathon twice. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing laurels on her head at a news conference, Isphording was holding the 
key to a new Mercedes Benz that she earned for winning the Los Angeles race. 
</P>
<P>
After speaking to reporters, she rushed off to call her mother, Sally, in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
"Mom, I can't believe it," Isphording said. "I wish you could have been here. 
It was so intense." 
</P>
<P>
Isphording ran a patient race, trailing for all but four miles of the 26.2 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Mosqueda set a fast pace, running the first 10 miles in 56:39 before 
Sirje Eichelmann of the Soviet Union passed her in the 11th mile. 
</P>
<P>
Eichelmann led for the next 11.5 miles before Isphording passed her at 22.5 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
"I passed her coming down a hill and I never looked back," Isphording said. "I 
heard someone scream out (that she had a 35-second lead) after mile 24, so I 
began to just race the clock." 
</P>
<P>
Isphording beat the clock and Eichelmann. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I couldn't win after Isphording passed me," Eichelmann said. "I was 
trying to run my own race so I could finish in the top three." 
</P>
<P>
Isphording built a 30-second lead over Eichelmann at the 24-mile mark and 
finished in 2 hours 32 minutes 25 seconds, a pace of 5:48.7 minutes per mile. 
Eichelmann was second in 2:33.26. 
</P>
<P>
Was Isphording concerned when Eichelmann took the lead? 
</P>
<P>
"I really never thought about it," she said. "I went out to run my own race and 
at mile 20 I was going to try to kick it in with whatever I had left and it 
just so happened that they were beginning to die. I was lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Running the Los Angeles Marathon evoked bad memories for Isphording, who failed 
to complete the first women's Olympic marathon at the 1984 Los Angeles Games. 
Isphording dropped out in the 11th mile because of a torn tendon in her right 
foot, which paralyzed the right side of her body. 
</P>
<P>
"The ambulance picked me up and I was actually leading the race at one point in 
the ambulance. They brought me back to the Coliseum and I pulled up a TV, 
packed my body in ice and watched Joan Benoit win the race." 
</P>
<P>
When Isphording made the last turn heading for the finish of Sunday's race, she 
saw a mural of Benoit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was neat to see that mural because Joan Benoit's done a lot for women's 
running," Isphording said. "It was neat to come down Exposition Blvd. and 
relive the Olympics. It's very fortunate that I did get my second chance out 
here. Winning this race means a lot to me." 
</P>
<P>
After failing to finish the 1984 Olympics and not making the 1988 Olympic team, 
Isphording, 28, hopes to compete in the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have a shot at hanging out till 1992," Isphording said.

EERIE MOMENT AT GERSTEN PAVILION; 
</P>
<P>
THE SCENE: THE MOMENT STARTED AS A TYPICAL ONE FOR A GREAT PLAYER. BUT IT 
SUDDENLY TURNED INTO A MOMENT OF HORROR, SENDING OUT SHOCK WAVES.

<P>
It was a spectacular, alley-oop dunk. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Gathers, at full speed from the right wing and high above the rim, took a 
35-foot pass from Terrell Lowery with his right hand and stuffed it through the 
basket -- with a Portland player between him and Lowery. 
</P>
<P>
It was patented Gathers. He, as the center of one of the greatest offenses in 
college basketball history, was known and admired for those kind of acrobatic 
antics. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big-time dunk. NBA style all the way," Portland forward Steve 
Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the incident, Loyola Marymount had just taken a 25-13 lead over 
Portland with Gathers dunk shot. 
</P>
<P>
As is Loyola's style, Gathers then hurriedly jockeyed into his normal position 
in the Lions' daunted full-court pressure defense near mid-court. 
</P>
<P>
He turned to face the inbounds pass, took a couple of steps to his right and 
crashed to the floor with a thud. 
</P>
<P>
"If you didn't see it, you heard it," said one fan. 
</P>
<P>
It was 5:14 on a Sunday afternoon. A gathering of 4,000 people never sounded so 
quiet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IT HAPPENED AGAIN 
</P>
<P>
Most of those in attendance for a West Coast Conference semifinal tournament 
game against Portland knew of Gathers mysterious fainting incident in December 
against Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Many immediately remembered that night here when Gathers fainted at the free 
throw line in the second half. It was eerie then; eerie now. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, it was happening again. Only this time, Gathers would not get up. 
</P>
<P>
One hour, 40 minutes later, at 6:55 p.m., Gathers was pronounced dead at Daniel 
Freeman Marina Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of his death will not be fully known until an autopsy is performed, 
but doctors believe Gathers sustained a sudden loss of blood pressure 
significant enough that it killed him. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly everyone was stunned, certainly distraught. 
</P>
<P>
Here was a magnificent athlete, capable of amazing feats of strength and 
endurance. And he was dead at age 23. 
</P>
<P>
"Words are hard right now," Loyola Coach Paul Westhead said, in a prepared 
statement. "This is the hardest thing I've experienced." 
</P>
<P>
Said Portland Coach Larry Steele, "We're all stunned, saddened, and just feel 
so helpless at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
Steele, who himself missed two games this earlier this season with a heart 
condition, said his and his players' thoughts and prayers "are with Hank's 
family, the Loyola Marymount team and the university." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HELP DOESN'T HELP 
</P>
<P>
After two or three seconds of apparent convulsions, Gathers seemed to snap out 
of it. He appeared to be like a boxer who had been knocked down but not out. 
</P>
<P>
But that moment was brief, too. He slumped back down, could not get up. 
</P>
<P>
A swarm of coaches, players, family and medical personnel soon surrounded him 
as he lay on his back, a few feet across the center line, on Loyola's offensive 
side of the court. 
</P>
<P>
Four minutes went by before the 6-foot-7 senior was lifted onto a stretcher and 
carried out the south exit of Gersten Pavilion. It would be another 15 minutes 
before the ambulance left for Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital. In that time, 
various attempts to revive him had only been temporarily successful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WATCHING, WAITING 
</P>
<P>
An announcement came over the public address system that the players had gone 
to the locker rooms for 10 minutes. They would not return for a game -- not on 
this night. 
</P>
<P>
"I had chills going through me, and I knew about his condition," said 
Portland's Hutchinson. "I figured he just fainted again and would be all right, 
but that wasn't the case." 
</P>
<P>
When the crowd was released at 5:45 -- one-half hour after Gathers first fell 
-- and informed that both the Loyola-Portland game and the USD-Pepperdine game, 
scheduled for 7 p.m., had been postponed indefinitely, it broke into applause, 
and people exited without incident. 
</P>
<P>
Very little information was made available concerning Gathers' condition, other 
than he had been taken to Daniel Freeman Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
At the hospital, everything that needed to be known about what had happened 
could be seen on the faces of family members and teammates who had gone to the 
hospital, hoping to wish Gathers well. There was nobody to wish well. He had 
died at 6:55 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Knight, a 6-10 sophomore at Loyola, emerged from the emergency room 
backdoor, looked into the night air and shouted, to nobody in particular: "I 
can't believe it. It can't be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE CAMPUS HEARS 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Jerry Neglia said that he heard the news while he was studying in the 
campus library. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't believe it at first," Neglia said. "Then I heard someone say that it 
was serious, really serious. I believed it after that." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Oscar Arce said that he heard that Gathers had died while he was in 
the student center, The Lair. 
</P>
<P>
Arce said that he and Gathers were in a class in English poetry together and 
that the class "isn't going to be the same. Just having him in the class was an 
honor." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Greg Miller said he was at the game and that he was shocked to see 
Gathers fall, especially since he stayed down for so long. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he didn't think that Gathers' death had "sunk in yet with the 
campus as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's really going to be bad this week."

PRIZED DEFEATS STEINLEN, KEEPS STABLE IN CLOVER; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: HE WINS $112,000 ARCADIA HANDICAP, PROVIDING OWNERS WITH 
ALTERNATIVE TO BIG 'CAP.

<P>
It was another enjoyable Santa Anita Handicap Day for the Clover Racing Stable. 
</P>
<P>
Without a representative in the main event, there was no way to duplicate 
Martial Law's 50-1 shocker in last year's Big 'Cap. 
</P>
<P>
Prized's come-from-behind victory in the $112,000 Arcadia Handicap, Sunday's 
supporting attraction, was more than satisfactory for the group headed by Barry 
Irwin and Jeff Siegel. 
</P>
<P>
In a showdown between the heroes in the two Breeders' Cup turf races, Prized 
was the clear-cut winner over Steinlen, the 1989 Eclipse Award winner as the 
nation's top grass performer. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, just about everybody got the best of Steinlen in his first start since 
he picked up his fifth straight win in the Breeders' Cup Mile. The 6-5 favorite 
and the 126-pound highweight, he finished seventh, ahead of only Summer Sale 
and Shining Steel. 
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines since he won his grass debut in the Breeders' Cup Turf, 
Prized, the 7-2 second choice, didn't look like he was headed for a successful 
comeback himself. 
</P>
<P>
With a half-mile to run, he and Eddie Delahoussaye had dropped back to last. A 
furlong later, they were still trailing. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Delahoussaye asked the 4-year-old son of Kris S. for some 
acceleration and it was forthcoming. Helped by the sizzling fractions (:21 4/5, 
:45 and 1:09) set by Summer Sale and On The Menu, Prized rallied along the 
inside through the stretch and beat 9-1 shot Happy Toss by a length with an 
unlucky On The Menu, the longest shot in the field at 50-1, a head back in 
third. 
</P>
<P>
If Prized had failed Sunday, it wouldn't have been totally unexpected. A mile 
isn't his best distance -- he never had won at anything less than 1 1/16 miles 
-- and his biggest victories had come at 1 1/8 and 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased," trainer Neil Drysdale said. "I think he shows more 
acceleration on the grass than he does on dirt. It should be a nice prep for 
the (1 1/2-mile) San Luis Rey (March 25). 
</P>
<P>
"He'd been training well, but I was concerned about the distance. He settled 
well and came from last. When Eddie asked him to go, he went." 
</P>
<P>
Although he has won half of his 10 starts on dirt, including a victory over 
Sunday Silence in last year's Swaps at Hollywood Park, Delahoussaye thinks 
Prized is more effective on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
"He seems a lot happier on the grass," he said. "He doesn't struggle as much. 
Hollywood Park's a good dirt for him, but he seems better on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran super. He really accelerated. He's kind and Neil's done a great job 
with him. He's more mature and he feels like a stronger horse now. I couldn't 
pull him up after the race." 
</P>
<P>
There was no such problem for Steinlen. Third after a quarter of a mile, it was 
apparent he was in trouble early on the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
"He got tired," said Wayne Lukas. "We ran a short horse. I thought he was 
tighter than he was. He needed the race. The nice thing is it's correctable." 
</P>
<P>
Second in Bill Shoemaker's farewell race, Happy Toss earned the place Sunday 
while beneficiary of a perfect trip. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in a good spot all the way around," said Fernando Toro. "It just took a 
champion to beat us. At the top of the stretch, I thought I had it. (On The 
Menu) drifted out and pushed me to the outside. But the winner was going to 
beat me anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Two races earlier, Warcraft, Charlie Whittingham's best 3-year-old prospect, 
rebounded from a 30-length defeat in the slop with a convincing victory over 
Apprised and six others at 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Able to make the lead on a very slow pace (:24, :48 3/5 and 1:13), the son of 
Ack Ack came away late to win by six lengths and he covered the last sixteenth 
in a rapid 6 1/5 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"Last time, I thought it was more the stuff (mud) hitting him in the face than 
it was him not getting a hold of the track," said Chris McCarron. "He's still 
green and still learning, but I feel like he has some potential." 
</P>
<P>
Magical Mile, who hasn't been seen since winning the Hollywood Juvenile last 
July, will return in Wednesday's feature, a $38,000 allowance race at six 
furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
A son of J.O. Tobin owned by Clement Hirsch and trained by Warren Stute, 
Magical Mile toyed with maidens in his first start, then suffered a broken knee 
while taking the Juvenile by four lengths. 
</P>
<P>
In his most recent work, he went five furlongs in 1:01 from the gate, a work 
termed breezing by the clockers. Previously, he went a mile in 1:43 1/5 Feb. 
24, five days after working seven furlongs in 1:28 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
Magical Mile will be ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye. Magical Mile's rivals 
Wednesday include Real Cash, who finished fourth at 17-10 in the Bolsa Chica 
Stakes, Drag Race, who hasn't made much noise since his surprise in the Del Mar 
Futurity last September, Iam The Iceman and Testtube Tommy, who were scratched 
from Saturday's San Rafael Stakes, and French Seventyfive.

HE GETS DOUBLE DOSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT; 
</P>
<P>
BIG 'CAP: TRAINER MCANALLY SEES HIS TWO HORSES FINISH LAST, CONFIRMING HIS 
WORST FEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On the morning of the Santa Anita Handicap, Ron McAnally should have been 
walking on air. Later that day, he would saddle both the favorite and the horse 
with the highest handicap weight in the million-dollar event. Given the chance, 
rival trainers would have been standing in line to trade places with the 
soft-spoken Kentuckian. 
</P>
<P>
But McAnally was worried. He wanted it to rain so he could take advantage of 
Bayakoa's superiority in the mud. He was worried about Ruhlmann, who was sure 
to throw a wrench into Bayakoa's front-running style. And he wanted everyone to 
quit reminding him that a mare had never won the race. That he knew. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally had reason to be worried. 
</P>
<P>
It was bad enough that Bayakoa, McAnally's champion mare, finished last as the 
favorite in the field of 10. And it was no less galling that Hawkster, his 
world-record setting turf horse and the highweight, finished next-to-last. 
</P>
<P>
The result of the Handicap was especially distressing to McAnally because he 
knew that neither of them really belonged in the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that this was my worst day as a trainer," McAnally said. "But it 
was certainly one of them." 
</P>
<P>
McAnally was standing in the Santa Anita post-race testing barn, watching 
Bayakoa cool off after the worst race of her brilliant career. The mare 
appeared fine, but winded. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, you kind of feel pressured into doing something you don't want to 
do," McAnally said. "I felt a little like that going into this race." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Hawkster, the pressure was overt. Owner Shelly Meredith, keen on 
proving Hawkster was as good on the dirt as he was on turf despite his 
two-for-14 record on the main track, insisted that his 4-year-old colt run in 
the Handicap over McAnally's objections. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Bayakoa, the pressure was more subtle. McAnally was already in 
the record books as the first man to win the race twice with the same horse -- 
John Henry in 1981-82. There was the temptation be the first to put a mare in 
the Big 'Cap winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
Although victorious in 10 of her last 11 starts, Bayakoa had never raced 
against males in this country and was a question mark at 1 1/4 miles. 
Previously, 35 mares had tried to win the Santa Anita Handicap, and only two 
had finished as high as second, the champions Gamely (1969) and Next Move 
(1951). 
</P>
<P>
Frank Whitham, the Kansas rancher who races Bayakoa with his wife, Jan, 
acknowledged the challenge as the field left the walking ring before the race. 
</P>
<P>
"We've bitten off a huge chore for her, that's for sure," Whitham said. "I hope 
she's up to it." 
</P>
<P>
She wasn't. Bayakoa, a front-runner, found herself more than six lengths off 
Ruhlmann's pace as the field raced down the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I could tell we were in trouble," Whitham said. "When Laffit 
(Pincay) had to ask her to run, she just didn't have it. It was almost like she 
was saying, 'I don't like the way this is going. That's it for today.' " 
</P>
<P>
McAnally cringed as he watched Hawkster hounding Bayakoa through the stretch 
the first time and into the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
"If Hawkster's not in there, she doesn't lose that ground around the turn and 
has a much better position," McAnally said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying it would have turned out any different, though," McAnally 
added. "All week long I was worrying about Ruhlmann getting loose on the lead. 
I knew he would go out there fast, but I told Laffit he couldn't worry about 
that. I was like everyone else -- I didn't think Ruhlmann could get the 
distance. But I was still worried about the affect he'd have on the way the 
race was run. When Charlie (Whittingham) runs a horse, you always have to 
respect him." 
</P>
<P>
To her credit, Bayakoa lasted longer than Hawkster. The colt raced forwardly 
and began to back up approaching the far turn, while the mare at least stayed 
with the pack to the quarter pole before Pincay took hold. 
</P>
<P>
"It was Del Mar all over again," said McAnally, referring to last summer's 
Chula Vista Handicap, in which Bayakoa failed to shake early pressure and 
wilted. 
</P>
<P>
After the Chula Vista, Bayakoa won the Ruffian Handicap, the Spinster Stakes 
and the Breeders' Cup Distaff to nail down her Eclipse Award. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you fault her?" Whitham said as he watched Bayakoa, acting as if he 
had let her down instead of the other way around. "I'm not upset. Disappointed, 
yes, but not upset." 
</P>
<P>
McAnally walked outside and looked to the sky, growing heavy with dark clouds. 
</P>
<P>
"It figures," he said. "In a few minutes she'll be back in the barn, and then 
it will start to rain. Boy, I'll be glad when this day is over."

QUALITY DOUBLES PLAY, STANFORD DUO TAKE CHILL OFF WEATHER

The conditions weren't the greatest -- temperatures in the low 50's, mixed with 
rain and biting winds -- but the quality of tennis at the 101st Pacific Coast 
Men's Doubles Championship more than made up for mother nature's grouchy mood. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford University freshmen Jonathon Stark and Jared Palmer carried the most 
impressive credentials into the tournament as the reigning Wimbledon and U.S. 
Open junior doubles champions. And although they did nothing to stain their 
reputations Sunday, it was not easy. 
</P>
<P>
It took Stark and Palmer, who have played together for three years, more than 2 
1/2 hours to put away USC's second-seeded team of Byron Black and Kent Seton, 
6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5). Black teamed with Eric Amend of USC to win the NCAA 
doubles championship last year. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours after beating Black and Seton, Stark and Palmer, seeded third, 
defeated Cal Berkeley's No. 1 seeded team of Matt Lucena and Bent Pederson, 
6-4, 7-5, in the finals of the 64-team tournament at the La Jolla Beach and 
Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
And within 30 minutes, Stark and Palmer were on a plane back to Palo Alto. 
Before leaving, Stark, last year's U.S. Open Junior singles champion, gave a 
quick analysis of the final's match. 
</P>
<P>
"We returned really well," said Stark, who is equipped with a wicked forehand 
and an even more lethal two-handed backhand. "They couldn't seem to hold their 
serves against us." 
</P>
<P>
Stark, already ranked as the NCAA's No. 2 singles player, was observant. He, 
along with his teammate, broke Lucena's serve twice and Pederson's once. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a little hard to serve because of the wind, and I was a little tired," 
said Lucena, a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Although they were seeded first, Lucena and Pederson, a junior from Oslo, 
Norway, had never played together before this weekend. Lucena's usual partner, 
Doug Eisenman, withdrew because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
"Those guys (Palmer and Stark) are really good players," Lucena said. "I guess 
for not having played together, we played pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the seriousness of Eisenman's injury the two teams could meet each 
other in the regular season and the Pac-10 championships in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
To reach the finals, Lucena and Pederson defeated fourth-seeded Jon Leach of 
Laguna Beach and Chris Dunk of Newport Beach, 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (4-7), 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
In the consolation finals, San Diego State's Dana Gill and Kerry Safdie were 
beaten by West Virginia's Rick Jacob and Ron Mercer, 6-4, 6-4.

WELFARE CASES ARE SOARING IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maria Medrano never thought she would be in this position. 
</P>
<P>
Medrano, a native of Guadalajara, Mexico, arrived here four years ago and had 
worked steadily until her recent layoff from a job on an airplane parts 
assembly line. Her savings dwindling and with two daughters to care for, one of 
them a diabetic, she turned to government assistance as her one remaining hope, 
her last resource. 
</P>
<P>
"I often cry," she said recently through an interpreter at the county's Garden 
Grove welfare office. "Everything is falling in on me, and I have to make so 
many decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Medrano is one of the increasing number of people applying for government 
assistance in Orange County, contributing to some of the heaviest welfare rolls 
in the county in nearly 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Orange County appears to be the only major urban center in the state 
that has not experienced an exodus of low-income residents to more affordable 
rural communities. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen some Laotians moving to the Central Valley, but the people who 
seem to be moving out are middle-class people who want a bigger home and 
typically move to the Inland Empire," said county demographer William F. Gayk. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the reasons for the Orange County anomaly are varied: a thriving 
local economy that produces jobs; an accommodation to high housing costs that 
finds more families -- especially Southeast Asians and Latinos -- sharing 
housing, and a maturing of the county as an urban center. 
</P>
<P>
The county is not, to be sure, possessed of a needy population or a welfare 
apparatus on the scale of Los Angeles, but it has nevertheless grown out of its 
suburban image. Many poor families perceive that they have more options here 
than they would in distant rural areas, social welfare officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County traditionally has had a much lower rate of welfare than, say, 
Los Angeles," Gayk said. Over time, he said, it has become more like the 
average urban area. 
</P>
<P>
A large proportion of Orange County's new welfare cases are teen-age mothers, 
divorced mothers and Latino and Southeast Asian immigrants -- members of groups 
that have apparently not benefited from the expansions in the local and state 
economies. 
</P>
<P>
County social service officials say there has been a steady growth of 5% to 7% 
in the welfare caseload over the past four years. In several welfare categories 
-- Aid To Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), food stamps and Medi-Cal -- 
the rates are at levels comparable to those of the early 1980s, when federal 
officials took steps to restrict eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
A relaxation of eligibility standards in recent years has played a part in the 
resurgence of applications, but county officials also single out other factors, 
such as local authorities' stepping up efforts to reach those eligible for 
assistance, applicants' larger family sizes and high living costs. 
</P>
<P>
Local officials say they are particularly alarmed by the growing number of 
unattached women who are unable to provide for their families. 
</P>
<P>
"You get into the issue of the disintegration of the family -- with divorce 
rates skyrocketing, leaving mom with the kids and totally unprepared to support 
the family," said Lawrence Leaman, director of the county's Social Services 
Agency. "The consensus here is that the feminization of poverty is real and 
Orange County is not exempt." 
</P>
<P>
Social service officials speak of welfare offices' bursting with women and 
children and that the picture is not likely to improve any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
Joerline DeBerg of Anaheim, a 31-year-old mother of three, leaned against her 
car outside the county's Garden Grove welfare office recently and, puffing a 
cigarette as she spoke, talked about her life. 
</P>
<P>
DeBerg said she had just received approval for an increase in her monthly AFDC 
check, from $694 to $834. She has been on and off welfare for years, she said, 
but she has also worked as an escrow officer. It is a good profession, a solid 
background, she says, but with 8-year-old twins and a 1 1/2-year-old, she 
cannot afford to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I pay $650 a month for a two-bedroom apartment," she said, "and I would have 
to pay a babysitter at least $130 a week. I make more on AFDC than I would 
working right now." 
</P>
<P>
For DeBerg, as for Medrano, depending on welfare is not something she likes 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like scum, like I couldn't do it on my own," she said. "It's 
embarrassing to take food stamps to the store and have them look at you. But 
after a while you realize that you have no alternative." 
</P>
<P>
It has been even harder on the children, she said. Twins Glen and Jason think 
their mother goes to the bank to get money. Kyland, the baby, is still too 
young to know the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the children that miss out, not me," she said. "They have to suffer by 
coming here all the time. We barely cope, but I have a good outlook, I have a 
goal. It won't be like this forever." 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of participants in the county's general relief program has 
remained fairly steady, increasing only by a few hundred, the number of AFDC 
and food stamp recipients rose dramatically between 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Through October of 1989, the county listed 60,000 people on AFDC, up from 
52,000 in early 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Food stamp recipients numbered 57,000 last October, up from 40,000 in early 
1988. Those on general relief number between 2,700 and 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
County officials note that applications for aid dipped between 1987 and 1988, 
possibly because many undocumented Latino immigrants feared jeopardizing their 
eligibility for permanent residency status if they applied for welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Mather, chairman of Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force, attributes 
much of the increase in welfare recipients to the high cost of living here. 
</P>
<P>
"The middle class is shrinking from both ends," Mather said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, wages for service sector jobs have not kept pace with the 
rising costs in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Mather also suggested that the vast numbers of baby boomers, who have left 
impressions in so many other areas of American life, are now of an age that 
produces the greatest number of welfare applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian refugees, the latest wave of immigrants to the United States, 
have begun to make their marks on the social fabric of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
To Hocquyen Tang, 44, is a refugee and former political prisoner from Saigon 
who landed in the United States with his parents and two sisters six months 
ago. Each was given $175 by the Catholic organization that co-sponsored their 
trip. All moved to Dayton, Ohio, to live with a brother. 
</P>
<P>
But Tang found the climate there too cold for his liking, so he came to Orange 
County a few weeks ago. He now pays $250 to share a room with a family in 
Midway City, a small unincorporated community near Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Tang had brought about $400 with him from Ohio but, without a job, he applied 
for aid under the county's general relief program. He will receive a monthly 
check of a little more than $300. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like I have to start from the beginning, to re-learn everything 
because here it is totally different from life in Vietnam," he said through an 
interpreter at the county's international assistance center in Anaheim. "Here, 
everyone must work to support themselves, but in Vietnam, the parents work and 
support the whole family." 
</P>
<P>
He hopes that eventually the rest of his family will be able to move here. 
There are not many Asians in Ohio, he said, and the family would be better able 
to communicate here and perhaps even "make a success."

CONVERT IS SUSPECT IN SLAYING OF LITTLE GIRL; 
</P>
<P>
STABBING: CHURCH OFFICIALS SAY THE MODEL CHURCHGOER SUSPECTED OF KILLING THE 
DAUGHTER OF A FRIEND RECENTLY BACKSLID INTO DRUG USE AND STRANGE BEHAVIOR.

Michael Robert Pacewitz was a model convert at Jacob's Well Christian Center, a 
fundamentalist church for young people trying to get off the streets. But about 
three weeks ago, church officials said, he quit his job at a local T-shirt shop 
and slid back into drug use. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday -- two days after mooning the church congregation during a service 
-- the 21-year-old Fullerton resident allegedly confessed to police that he had 
fatally stabbed the 3-year-old daughter of a fellow church member. 
</P>
<P>
While Pacewitz on Sunday was held without bail in the Fullerton City Jail on 
suspicion of murder, friends and fellow churchgoers blamed Pacewitz's actions 
on his renewed use of methamphetamines. 
</P>
<P>
"The devil really ripped him off," said Andy St. Pierre, 21, an usher at the 
church and a housemate of Pacewitz's. "Apparently he just went over the edge." 
</P>
<P>
According to Fullerton police, Pacewitz had called from a pay phone at 5:54 
a.m. Saturday to say he had just "killed a baby." Officers broke into the 
apartment of Pacewitz's church friend, Joanne Boydston, and discovered her 
daughter, Marcelline Boydston, dead from numerous stab wounds. Boydston's 
9-month-old boy was found unharmed and placed in protective custody. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services for the daughter are pending later this week, after an 
autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Pacewitz was baby-sitting for Boydston at the time of the killing. 
Boydston, 25, who is separated from her husband and works in a doctor's office, 
did not learn of the death until later in the day, at which time officials said 
she became hysterical. She was questioned and released Saturday night at the 
Fullerton Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tragic thing, man," said church Pastor Robert Town. "I just pray for 
her (Joanne Boydston)." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, Boydston and her estranged husband briefly attended the 
Jacob's Well services inside a Fullerton warehouse but left quickly as Town 
began to conduct a wedding of two church-goers. She spent much of the rest of 
the day at the La Habra home of her brother, Rick Boydston. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want people to know that she's hurting right now," said Rick Boydston, 
32, a chemist. "She misses her daughter very much." 
</P>
<P>
Boydston added that he too felt uncomfortable discussing the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of grief to have to have your dirty laundry airing in public like 
this," he said. "I guess this is something that doesn't happen all the time. 
It's like something you hear about on Donahue." 
</P>
<P>
Boydston said late Sunday that his sister had gone to a friend's house and did 
not want to comment on the stabbing of her daughter. He said both he and his 
sister are upset, however, about what he called media implications that she was 
a bad mother. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like she was neglectful," he said. "She's had her problems being a 
single parent, but she has a job now and she had her own place. She seemed to 
be doing OK." 
</P>
<P>
Boydston added that his sister did not leave her children under Pacewitz's care 
Friday night but with another church friend who left Pacewitz in charge after 
leaving later in the night. Boydston said his sister's estranged husband 
usually baby-sits the children. 
</P>
<P>
John Robinson, an usher at the 6-year-old Jacob's Well church, said he helped 
convert Boydston and Pacewitz a year ago while they lived in separate rooms of 
a low-rent Anaheim motel. Pacewitz was living with his mother, while Boydston 
lived with her family. The two were friends before they joined the church, 
churchgoers said, and both were suffering from drug addiction before being 
"saved" in a Bible study class. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, usher St. Pierre said, Pacewitz was a highly regarded member of 
the congregation of about 250 people, including many former drug addicts, 
prison convicts and gang members who were enticed to the church by an outreach 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike had always been a good guy," said St. Pierre, a recovering cocaine 
addict. "He was always at church helping to clean up and mop floors." 
</P>
<P>
However, a non-church friend who asked not to be identified said that Pacewitz 
became so "brainwashed" by the Jacob's Well church that he stood on street 
corners preaching and warned her that "you could go to hell" for smoking a 
cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
"He was one of the nicest people I had ever met before he joined that church," 
said the woman, a friend in an Anaheim townhome complex where Pacewitz lived 
before moving to the motel about two years ago. "He came over after being in 
the church, and he was like a totally different person. He would tell us: 'You 
need to be saved.' " 
</P>
<P>
The friend speculated: "When he got back on drugs, he probably felt some guilt. 
I think his mind just snapped." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to helping clean the church, Pacewitz, a painter and handyman, also 
worked for a church-operated painting company until he tired of the job about 
two months ago and took up St. Pierre's offer to work with him at Expressions 
Screen Print and Embroidery in Anaheim, St. Pierre said. He worked there until 
about three weeks ago, when he resigned after making a series of mistakes in 
embroidering T-shirts, St. Pierre said. "He had printed a couple of numbers on 
a shirt upside down and the next day said he would not be working anymore," St. 
Pierre recalled. 
</P>
<P>
That is when Pacewitz began using methamphetamime, or "crystal," and became 
increasingly distant while living at a church-operated home for congregation 
members, St. Pierre said. Pacewitz moved out to another church home about a 
week ago and showed up for services last Thursday, during which, Town said, 
Pacewitz dropped his pants and "mooned" the congregation.

OCEAN TRYOUTS: WOULD-BE LIFEGUARDS GASPED ON THE BEACH AFTER RUNNING NEAR THE 
ALISO PIER IN SOUTH LAGUNA AND SWIMMING AROUND IT IN THE COLD OCEAN AS PART OF 
A SERIES OF TESTS.

<P>
Tony Harris grabbed his stomach and panted. He had just finished first in a 
1,200-yard run-and-swim test for prospective lifeguards at Aliso Beach, and he 
was paying a price. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the coldest I've ever been," said a gasping Harris, 19, originally from 
Australia but now living in Costa Mesa. "When I first started in the water, I 
could not breathe." 
</P>
<P>
But he made it, along with 45 other men and women, all trying to be among the 
first batch of new lifeguards hired this year to patrol 15 county-run beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The race was the first in a series of tests for applicants who hope to be 
chosen for lifeguard training by U.S. Ocean Safety Inc., a Laguna Beach 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, U.S. Ocean Safety won a $632,000 contract over Lifeguard 
International Beach Services, which had provided its services to the county for 
the past 10 years. For the company's founders -- veteran Orange County 
lifeguards Mike Gaughan and Jack Lincke -- that means hiring and training 60 
lifeguards by April 7. All must be certified by the U.S. Lifesaving Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The lifeguards, who will be paid $8.25 to $10.25 an hour, will be assigned to 
beach areas that include Sunset Beach, the county-owned beach immediately 
adjacent to the Santa Ana River mouth, Capistrano Beach and nine beaches south 
of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's test also gave state officials a chance to interest applicants in 
their beaches. Gus Avila, a state beach lifeguard, was there passing out 
flyers, encouraging some who didn't do so well Sunday to try out on April 1, 
when the state will conduct similar tests at Huntington State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Some swimmers have bad days," Avila said. "I'm here to tell them that they can 
try again." 
</P>
<P>
But after the drill, Lincke said that this pool of applicants had performed 
well. Only one man dropped out, deciding early on in the race that the waters 
were too frigid. 
</P>
<P>
The rest braved the "run-swim-run-swim-run" course under cloudy skies and the 
threat of drizzle. Trained lifeguards guided the competitors as they ran down 
the beach, plunged into the water and swam around the Aliso Pier, got out of 
the water and ran farther down the beach. Then they jumped back into the water, 
swam around a buoy, then around the pier again, got out and sprinted to the 
finish line. Wet suits were not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to be used to going in the water because if they're a lifeguard, 
they don't have the time to put on a wet suit," said Logan Lockabey, a former 
Newport Beach lifeguard who was helping coordinate the testing. The race, he 
said, shows how applicants judge the surf, what shape they are in and how they 
pace themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants also must be 18 years or older and must have 20/40 uncorrected 
vision, Lockabey said. Later Sunday, the lifeguard hopefuls underwent a 
first-aid test and were quizzed about their knowledge of the beaches, surf and 
marine safety. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not picking people strictly on speed in the water," Lockabey said. "It's 
a lot of public relations work and work with other agencies." 
</P>
<P>
For many, getting selected will be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fun job," said Harris, who has been a "life-saver," the Australian 
counterpart to a lifeguard. "You meet a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
Many who tried out were former lifeguards who have an urge to get back to their 
old job. Some knew either Lincke or Gaughan, both of whom teach at Orange Coast 
College. 
</P>
<P>
"Lifeguarding's a small world," said Gina Aubrey, 27, a former lifeguard in San 
Clemente. "It's a pretty tight-knit bond up and down the coast." 
</P>
<P>
Aubrey, now an Orange County firefighter, finished eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Also testing was Greg Boyer, 32, of Laguna Beach, who said the lifeguard job 
would help him pay expenses at Western State University College of Law in 
Fullerton. A member of the 1988 U.S. Olympic water polo team in Seoul, Boyer 
was also a lifeguard in Huntington Beach for several years. He finished ninth 
in the testing on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I won my trial when I was 17," he said. "I guess people are getting faster and 
I'm getting slower." 
</P>
<P>
Like many others, Boyer said that he felt the pinch in the cold water. 
</P>
<P>
"That water makes it seem warm out here," he said, standing on the beach after 
the race. "It kind of separates the fair weather swimmers from the cold weather 
swimmers." 
</P>
<P>
For Robert Seely, 22, the water wasn't the only thing he had to worry about. 
Applicants were told to stay as close as possible as they went around the pier. 
Seely scraped up against the pier, giving him a scratch on his leg. But he 
still finished 10th. 
</P>
<P>
"I got stuck between a guy and a piling, and the piling got the best of me," 
Seely said. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Walsh, 18, a member of the Orange Coast College water polo team and native 
of Long Island, N.Y., said the prospect of working at the beach lured him into 
applying. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a job during the summer," he said. "It looks like a lot of fun. . . . 
It's the California thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
But another first-time applicant wondered if the job was worth the pain endured 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my friends said it would be a fun thing to do," Randy Jones, 18, a 
student at Orange Coast College, said after finishing the race. "After doing 
that, it better be fun."

PROBLEMS REMAIN AT DAYWORKER SITES 
</P>

<P>
Despite the city's attempts to move day laborers seeking work to a site on 
Laguna Canyon Road, dozens of them still gather each morning along Coast 
Highway in North Laguna. "There are anywhere from 10 to 100 out there," said 
Perminder Singh, manager of the Circle K market at the corner of Viejo Street 
and North Coast Highway, where the workers mainly congregate. "The numbers 
change for a while, but they always come back." 
</P>
<P>
Janna Moore, community services officer for the Laguna Beach Police Department, 
said she has received complaints from North Laguna residents but disagreed on 
the numbers of laborers who gather at the market. 
</P>
<P>
"We do go out there on a daily basis and try to get (laborers) to go to the 
designated site, but it's a voluntary compliance situation," she said. "There 
are no more than 30 usually out there." Moore said dayworkers still congregate 
there because they have less competition and therefore a better chance of being 
hired. Also, people who hire them "don't get as mobbed" as they do at the 
canyon site, where about 70 gather each day, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The city spent $9,000 to improve the canyon hiring area, installing a sign to 
identify the site, paving a turnaround driveway, installing portable restrooms 
and distributing information pamphlets in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Jahraus, owner of Laguna Beach Lumber Co., said the improvements have 
resulted in a "dramatically better situation." 
</P>
<P>
"They're behaving themselves pretty well," he said of the workers who gather 
across the street from his business. "They're pretty much sticking to their own 
side." 
</P>
<P>
But for Singh in North Laguna, the problems remain. "They give me about $100 a 
day in business but I'm getting no profit," he said. "I have never seen so many 
new methods to steal. I've called the cops, but they can't stay here 24 hours a 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Singh said that although the majority of the dayworkers do not interfere with 
his business, some accost female customers, pour coffee on the floor, defecate 
in the back of the store and steal his goods. The problems continue, despite an 
INS sweep last week that netted 16 workers there. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only about 25 out there today," Singh said after the arrests. "There 
will be fewer for four or five days, but then you'll see new faces and old 
faces too. This isn't the first time that's happened." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the problems, Singh said he feels sorry for the dayworkers because they 
need work. "I'm a foreigner too, and I've been there," said Singh, a native of 
India. "But if they are to ever own something, they have to be good." LESLIE

POLICE TURN TO TV TO CATCH THIEVES

At 9:41 Wednesday morning, Motor Officer Steve Spernak of the Cypress Police 
Department was in hot pursuit of a man suspected of parole violation. After 
jumping a few fences, running through five back yards and setting up a 
seven-man barricade, he and other officers found the man hiding in a doghouse. 
</P>
<P>
That was at 9:58. Four minutes later, Spernak swept into the studio of the 
local cable TV station. A production assistant frantically put makeup on his 
still-perspiring face and simultaneously tried to reshape his "helmet hair." 
</P>
<P>
Seconds later, Spernak, looking as composed as if he had been there all 
morning, took a deep breath, looked into the camera and smiled. "I am here 
today to talk about what people should do if they are in their cars and hear 
sirens," Spernak said, launching into a list of traffic-safety tips. Director 
John Olson, watching from the control room, breathed a sigh of relief. The 
taping would proceed as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Spernak and a team of other officers are the regular guests on "Cypress: Your 
City, Your Police," a local version of "America's Most Wanted." Although it may 
lack the elaborate sets and realistic re-enactments of the national program, it 
represents an attempt to involve people in crime-solving. 
</P>
<P>
The show, on the air since January, is the brainchild of Detective Carlos 
Solorza, who works in the property crimes division, and Community Service 
Officer Pam Kelch, who is its hostess. Seeing the popularity of the national 
show, Solorza and Kelch decided to try it on a local level in hopes of turning 
up more leads on burglaries. The show airs one Tuesday a month at 11 a.m. and 
7:30 p.m. on Channel 52. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times people don't even know what's happened on their own street," 
Solorza says. 
</P>
<P>
Standing before a map of the city divided into 48 sections, Solorza points out 
for the viewers where burglaries were reported in the last month. He lists the 
method of entry for each and provides, if one is available, a description of 
the person involved. At the end of the segment he urges members of the audience 
to call the Police Department should they have any information about a 
particular crime. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress, like many Orange County cities, has had increases in residential and 
auto burglaries over the past few years, Lt. John Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
"With 52 cops and seven square miles to cover, we can't be everywhere all the 
time," Schaefer said. However, chances are good that someone in the city of 
42,000 residents was there and did see something when a crime occurred, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The show, originally 15 minutes long, is now almost an hour. It also includes 
segments about local community service organizations, tips on home safety and a 
"Meet Your Policeman" portion that introduces individual members of the force. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it has not achieved what other television crime-stopper shows have: 
audience participation. To date, it has not prompted a single telephone call, 
officers say. 
</P>
<P>
But Kelch and the others remain optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's new. Hopefully, they will come in time," Kelch said. LYNDA NATALI

High school senior Debbie Hughes of Fountain Valley has goals much like other 
teen-agers: She wants to go to UC Davis and become a veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
But for Debbie, pursuing them means traveling the many miles to University High 
School in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie, who is deaf, is one of 67 Orange County teen-agers enrolled in the 
county's only program for the hearing-impaired that allows them to attend 
regular classes with their hearing peers. 
</P>
<P>
The students in the program also participate in all the activities that are 
part of a regular high school life. Their circumstances are acknowledged but 
not considered a problem. They are there to interact as much as possible with 
hearing peers. And, like all of the school's students, they are encouraged to 
set goals, such as landing part-time jobs or attending college. There are, 
however, special workshops for the hearing-impaired students to help them with 
any problems. 
</P>
<P>
"They (administrators) make sure that we participate and treat us all the 
same," Debbie says. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the students in the program attend mainstream classes. There 
are interpreters for them in these, and also for any of the extracurricular 
activities they may be pursuing. The interpreters are present during every 
game, practice and meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The school's sports programs and student government have both counted 
hearing-impaired students among their participants. This year, though, for the 
first time in the history of the program, there is a hearing-impaired student 
on the cheerleading squad. Erika Dickson, a junior, said she is pleased with 
the acceptance she has received. MARCI HANOVER

HOMEOWNERS SEEK TO BLOCK ANNEXATION

<P>
The leader of a North Tustin homeowners group said it plans to take legal 
action to block annexation of a 7.8-acre strip of land along Newport Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
William C. Weber Jr., president of Foothill Communities Assn., said the group's 
board of directors believes the annexation does not meet legal requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Dessa Schroeder, chairwoman of the North Tustin Municipal Advisory Council, 
said the group recommended against approval because it was a strip annexation, 
which current laws are designed to prevent. 
</P>
<P>
But Christine Shingleton, director of community development for Tustin, said 
the annexation meets all legal requirements. Although approval is already 
final, anyone who objects to it has 60 days from the time the annexation is 
recorded to file an action in court, said James J. Colangelo, director of the 
Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO). The annexation was recorded with the 
county last week. 
</P>
<P>
The city initiated the annexation procedure in September at the request of area 
property owners. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO approved the annexation in November and upheld its decision in January. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the City Council held a protest hearing at which two North Tustin 
residents spoke in opposition to the annexation. But, by law, the council could 
not deny the request unless it received written protests from owners whose 
property accounted for more than half of the annexation area's value. 
</P>
<P>
Weber said a committee of the Foothill Communities Assn., which includes about 
500 homes and nearly 1,000 members, has been working on a report on the 
benefits and drawbacks of North Tustin's annexation to Tustin or incorporation 
as its own entity. A consultant's report is expected by the end of the week, 
and then communitywide meetings will be scheduled for the findings to be 
presented, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 residents of North Tustin live in an unincorporated area that 
falls within Tustin's sphere of influence. SHANNON SANDS

BUDGET WOES LOOM, CITY MANAGER SAYS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A budget crunch could hit in the new fiscal year, the city manager has told the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager George Tindall said tax revenues are below projections for the 
first half of 1989-90 and a much bigger gap between income and expenses could 
develop for 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
"About 40% of our budget is based on the economy," principally sales taxes, 
Tindall said. Those were about $500,000 below projections because of a slowdown 
in retail sales, he said. "On the other hand, our expenses were down 
substantially because of a number of vacancies on our staff at this time. 
</P>
<P>
The "problem, though, is that we have a trend," he said. If tax revenues don't 
increase, "we'll have to make them (the vacancies) permanent. And that's 
alarming." 
</P>
<P>
More ominous for the new fiscal year is an estimated $1.5 million in new costs 
and funding decreases from various federal and state agencies, Tindall said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990-91 budget will be brought to the council in May or June, Tindall said.

CITY DEBATES FATE OF 'PEOPLE'S PARK'

<P>
Almost four months after voters decided Newport Beach should not sell a plot of 
land dubbed "People's Park," city officials are still considering what to do 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
The debate over the fate of the 30-by-100-foot lot at 4210 River Ave. continued 
at a recent City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Park neighbors who have planted trees on the lot and maintain it as a mini-park 
are asking the city to rezone the land to ensure it is kept open for 
recreational use, said Irene Butler, assistant city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
However, the council voted unanimously to review all potential uses for the 
lot, including the possibility of building affordable housing on the site, 
Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 12, the city's Parks, Beaches and Recreation Department advised the 
City Council that the lot is not needed as part of the city's park system and 
recommended that the current R-2 zoning be maintained. LESLIE EARNEST

LA QUINTA, COSTA MESA, BREA GIRLS OPEN AT HOME

Kevin Kiernan, La Quinta High School girls' basketball coach, had some advice 
for Rancho Alamitos assistant Eric Hamamoto as they stood outside the Southern 
Section office Sunday examining the Southern California Regional basketball 
pairings. 
</P>
<P>
"Go to the Sizzler. 
</P>
<P>
It's worked for us twice," said Kiernan, whose La Quinta team won its first 
Southern Section title Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
It's that time of year when coaches try to wear the same shirt that got them 
through the Southern Section tournament. Superstition is in the air. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs went to the restaurant before their victory on the road against Palm 
Desert in the semifinals and before defeating West Torrance in the 4-A final at 
Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, La Quinta doesn't have to worry about playing on the road 
again. The Aztecs (27-2) will be at home for Tuesday night's opening-round 
Division II game against Sanger (22-11), as will Costa Mesa and Brea-Olinda in 
the Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos, runner-up to Costa Mesa in 3-A, travels to LeMoore (20-7) for 
its first game. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs have the task of playing in the same division as the state's No. 1 
team, Brea-Olinda. Brea (30-0) will play host to San Diego Lincoln (14-7). 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa is in the lower half of the draw away from top-seeded Brea-Olinda. 
However, if the Mustangs get past Selma (14-10) in the first round, they most 
likely would face Palos Verdes, the 3-AA runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously I would like to have had Palos Verdes, Rancho Alamitos and Brea all 
in the above bracket, but this is the way I thought it would be," Costa Mesa 
Coach Jim Weeks said.

ACTOR EDWARD DUKE IS WRITING HIS OWN TICKET TO SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: A ONCE- STRUGGLING BRITON HAS CLAIMED FAME BY ADAPTING THE WORKS OF 
HUMORIST P.G. WODEHOUSE, AND HE HAS CHANGED AND GROWN IN THE PROCESS.

<P>
It has been 10 years since Edward Duke became the eternal upper-class twit 
Bertie Wooster (think of Charlie Brown as a British aristocrat), Bertie's 
doughty and demanding Aunts Agatha and Dahlia ("totally unfit for human 
consumption") and, of course the incomparable Jeeves, the gentleman's gentleman 
who manages Bertie, living in dread that his charge will humiliate him by 
wearing a checked suit, in the one-man, 12-character show "Jeeves Takes 
Charge." 
</P>
<P>
Duke said it may also be the last year for him in this showcase piece, produced 
by Charles Duggan at the Lyceum Stage in San Diego on Wednesday through March 
25. But it will also be a hard show to let go. Based on the works of humorist 
P.G. Wodehouse and adapted by Duke himself, the show has been a 
fame-and-fortune ticket for the once-struggling British actor, now 36 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
After about 1,200 performances, the comic vehicle has also become the unlikely 
prism through which he has seen himself change and grow over the years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, when Duke brought the show to Los Angeles, Times critic Dan Sullivan 
noted that there was "a hint of a corpse in the bedroom, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan didn't know it, but there was a corpse of a sort. Duke's mother had 
recently died of cancer, followed shortly by his father dying of a heart 
attack, and Duke couldn't enter into the spirit of the show during that run. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Duke has delved more deeply into what he hastens to stress is still 
very much a light comedy. Jeeves, whom he said he never fully understood when 
he premiered the show a decade ago in the West End of London in 1980, is now 
very much drawn from his father, once a British diplomat in Tokyo, whom Duke 
said he never really understood while he was alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Jeeves is very much my Dad," said Duke quietly in a San Diego 
Repertory Theatre office. "Extremely strait-laced, worried about what people 
thought of him. It's funny how grief takes hold. I couldn't find Jeeves until I 
found his affection for Bertie. He was a distant character like my father. He 
would never show his feelings, but they were there. 
</P>
<P>
"When my dad retired, he liked nothing better than setting the table and 
polishing the silver. Since he died, maybe that's when Jeeves jelled for me." 
</P>
<P>
He described Bertie Wooster, who had always come more easily to him, as being 
just like his mother -- "mad as a hatter." 
</P>
<P>
It was his identification with Bertie that first drew him to the project. 
Always a bit of a rebel, Duke at 24, had been expelled from what he calls 
"every respectable school," including Stonyhurst (home to other famous expelled 
alumni Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Charles Laughton). He finished his schooling 
in Japan, where his father was stationed, and moved back to London determined 
to be an actor. 
</P>
<P>
He was grateful in a way for the expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had stayed, I would have turned into an upper-class twit like one of my 
characters. Now I can see them from a detached perspective." 
</P>
<P>
But he wasn't as happy about the roles he was playing in the theater: box 
office clerk and the lighting person running follow spots on singer Tommy 
Steele in the Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
"I started to read Wodehouse to take my mind off the obsessive frustration of 
not being given my chance," said Duke. "Then I decided I wanted to show off, 
and Wodehouse would be my vehicle. I thought Bertie Wooster fitted me quite 
well because he was such a goof. When I first started doing it, I thought I 
would play Jeeves and Bertie as being two sides of the same coin. But this was 
madness on my part because I was much too young to play Jeeves. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only in the last year of the show I feel that I've gotten it right." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, audiences, critics and producers in last 10 years were not as hard 
on Duke as he is on himself. 
</P>
<P>
Duke previewed the piece as a lunchtime show over a London pub, paying for the 
expenses -- 1,000 pounds -- with all the money he had. Hardly anyone came. But 
the story had a happy ending when he presented the show in 1978 for Andrew 
Lloyd Webber at the Sydmonton Art Festival and Lloyd Webber, a man who knows a 
hit when he sees one, showed his approval by producing him in London in 1980. 
There, Duke received the Society of West End Theatre Award for Most Promising 
New Actor of 1980 and ran for five months. 
</P>
<P>
Duke then played Off Broadway in 1983 at the Manhattan Theatre Club for three 
months, where he picked up a Drama Desk nomination for outstanding solo show. 
He has traveled throughout the United States, Canada and Australia and 
performed the show privately for the Queen Mother, reportedly a Wodehouse fan. 
</P>
<P>
Another great fan was Wodehouse's widow. Lady Ethel Wodehouse, who lived in 
Southhampton, Long Island, left Duke $10,000 in her will for his show, along 
with the clock on her husband's desk and her husband's black bow tie, which 
Duke wears at the top of Act II. 
</P>
<P>
She also left him memories of a person he describes as "a great" as well as 
eccentric woman, who seemed to walk right out of the pages of one of her 
husband's novels. 
</P>
<P>
Duke's favorite memory is seeing her draw stick figures with a marking on an 
original Canaletto painting she had, saying "That's much better. I think it 
needed some more people in it." 
</P>
<P>
Lady Ethel also told him stories about her husband, a workaholic who only took 
two hours out of the day for lunch and for "General Hospital," his favorite 
show. 
</P>
<P>
"He loved the plot twists," Duke said she told him. "He could never think how 
they were going to get everyone out of the predicaments they had gotten them 
into." 
</P>
<P>
Duke would like to keep "Jeeves Takes Charge" alive, even though he would like 
to retire from the show himself. It was with that hope that he rehearsed San 
Diego actor Don Sparks in the part for the show's Old Globe Theatre debut in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks was a hit, with Duke stepping in for him when Sparks' mother died during 
the course of the run; Duke said he didn't want Sparks to have to perform the 
way he did when his parents died. 
</P>
<P>
But Sparks subsequently moved to Los Angeles, where he works in the television 
series "L.A. Law," and Duke found himself without an heir-apparent again. 
</P>
<P>
Duke will perform the show in San Francisco in May.

DANGEROUS TRUTH IN MARK LEE'S 'REBEL ARMIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though the pen may be mightier than the sword, sometimes they work in 
conjunction with each other. One word, casually inserted into a foreign 
correspondent's story, can kill. 
</P>
<P>
Neal Bateman (Jim Phipps), a wire service stringer who has just been expelled 
from Uganda, is afraid that one of his words has -- ever so indirectly -- 
slaughtered an entire village. 
</P>
<P>
In "Rebel Armies Deep Into Chad," at the Old Globe's Cassius Carter Centre 
Stage, playwright Mark Lee amplifies Neal's anxiety into an examination of the 
importance, the difficulty and the danger of truth-telling. 
</P>
<P>
It's an evergreen subject for playwrights, but Lee's specifics are fairly 
fresh, and he handles his chosen themes with considerable agility. This play is 
likely to get a buzz going in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not as likely to set the heart pumping. Neal's story is told -- or 
revealed -- in retrospect, after he has been expelled from Uganda, in the 
relative safety of the home (lots of barbed wire and beer bottles, designed by 
Kent Dorsey) of the wire service's Nairobi correspondent (Richard Kneeland). A 
Ugandan refugee, Christina (Cheryl Francis Harrington), hired by the 
correspondent as a prostitute for Neal, is the character who gets him to 
divulge what happened. 
</P>
<P>
For a moment, when Christina recalls her own reason for leaving Uganda and then 
realizes the potential peril of being seen with Neal, we begin to feel the heat 
of the situation. Harrington has the presence and the inner fire to make the 
most of this moment. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, though, this is a reflective play, an inquiry into events of the 
recent past -- events that are not re-enacted on stage. 
</P>
<P>
As such, an undue burden is placed on the actor playing Neal to carry us along 
on Neal's mental journey -- or at least so it appears in Adrian Hall's staging. 
Actor Phipps has mastered Neal's nervous demeanor -- the correspondent 
describes him as a gazelle -- but he hasn't visibly opened himself up to the 
fuller dimensions of the role. We don't see him progressively inching closer to 
the truth, or finally acknowledging it in his gut. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Lee has written a couple of lines for Neal that simply don't ring true; 
would this gun-shy young man really ask two prostitutes to chant "om" in order 
to give him the time to say something to his host? Well, maybe so; Lee was 
there -- he was himself a wire service stringer expelled from Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
To a lesser extent, the play also follows the older correspondent's journey 
from being the completely detached observer into acceptance of his own share of 
responsibility for what happened. But while Lee paints the first part of this 
journey almost to excess, establishing this man as an observer and interrogator 
-- and loner -- of the first order, his eventual acceptance of responsibility 
feels like an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Kneeland has a convincingly scruffy, devil-may-care air about him, 
marred only by occasional swallowed lines, sacrificed to the dictates of 
arena-style blocking (the blocking is also a problem for the "freeze frame" 
that ends the first act; those of us on one side of the theater literally 
couldn't see it). 
</P>
<P>
The correspondent's jaded sensibility is shared by the older of the two 
prostitutes, well portrayed by Rose Weaver. Lee has drawn interesting 
generational parallels here between two very different classes of people. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Lee's points is that the editors of Western publications aren't very 
interested in Africa and the daily events there -- unless it can be dressed up 
in highly dramatic imagery or in thumb-sucking pieces about "the big picture." 
Neal began his job with fantasies of writing dispatches under sweeping 
headlines like "Rebel Armies Deep Into Chad," but he has found that the reality 
is more complicated -- involving many little murders instead of massive 
military ventures -- and that not many of his editors care about such things. 
</P>
<P>
So it's ironic that Lee's play really isn't about the many little murders among 
Africans either; it's about the ethical quandaries faced by Western journalists 
within Africa. Of course that's probably what Lee felt most qualified to write 
about. Still, it's as if he assumed that the people who select plays, even at 
enlightened theaters like the Old Globe, would be no more interested than 
Neal's editors if he focused on the Ugandans rather than the Westerners. 
</P>
<P>
This assumption may be incorrect. At least in this production, when Christina 
recounts what happened to her in Uganda, it's more gripping than anything that 
Neal has to say. Neal's story is important -- this play is essential viewing 
for journalists. But like the correspondent in the play who missed an 
assassination because he was busy with his own affairs, Lee may have missed the 
best story in Uganda.

<P>
The job of the journalist, like that of a witness on the stand, is to tell the 
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. 
</P>
<P>
But what if telling the truth claims innocent lives? What is a fact weighed in 
balance with life and death? 
</P>
<P>
That is the question posed by Mark Lee's "Rebel Armies Deep Into Chad," which 
was given its West Coast premiere Saturday at the Old Globe Theatre's Cassius 
Carter Centre Stage. 
</P>
<P>
It is a question that matters deeply to Lee, who filed news reports as a 
correspondent in war-torn Uganda from 1980 to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Lee, a Minneapolis native now living in Los Angeles, said he doesn't believe 
that anything he wrote contributed to anyone's death. But the idea that he 
might slip and inadvertently endanger one of his sources was constantly on his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were seen talking to someone in the marketplace, that person could be 
picked up and shot," Lee said in an interview at the Old Globe, shortly before 
a recent rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
"What is autobiographical is that I was always scared that, through an accident 
of my own, I would cause someone to die. The responsibility of a journalist -- 
What are you going to report? What are you going to do to ascertain the truth? 
-- worried me the whole time as a constant psychological presence. What do you 
do if you're alone? And I was alone." (For a full year, Lee said, he was the 
only Western journalist working in Uganda.) 
</P>
<P>
It was his very interest in such life-and-death issues that sent him to Africa 
in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
When Lee, now 38, studied at Yale, his most influential teacher was Pulitzer 
Prize-winning writer Robert Penn Warren (named the first poet laureate of the 
United States in 1986), to whom he dedicates "Rebel Armies." Lee credits Warren 
with encouraging him to think about the "big questions." 
</P>
<P>
After graduation in 1973, Lee considered and rejected law school, then turned 
to various jobs -- taxi driver, security guard, hawker of "little green things 
that glow in the dark" -- all while he wrote poetry and short stories and 
explored the New York literary scene. 
</P>
<P>
But the smug insularity of that life made him uncomfortable. While living in 
Rome in the late '70s, he read about the civil war in Ethiopia's Eritrean 
region and decided to acquire press credentials -- originally from the Pacific 
News Service in San Francisco because he had no journalism experience and that 
organization "would give credentials to anyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that these people in Ethiopia were sacrificing their life for 
something they believed in was exciting for me because I think I was used to 
people in the New York literary scene who were worried about where their next 
grant was coming from," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
"I passed through Nairobi and met the United Press (International) bureau chief 
and tried to interest him in letting me write for him. He told me I should go 
to Kampala, Uganda, because there were only two stringers there and they were 
about to be thrown out of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Once there, he found out why stringers didn't last very long in Uganda -- all 
you had to do to be expelled was write a story about the frequent government 
atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
Lee bought time in Uganda by turning down an offer to write for BBC radio and 
sticking to print journalism (government officials listened to the radio, but 
didn't bother to catch his stories in foreign newspapers, he learned). 
</P>
<P>
He also was indirectly helped by his editors overseas, who did not think 
killings in Kampala were worthy of big play. 
</P>
<P>
"Eighty percent of my work was spiked," Lee said. "They didn't want massacre 
stories." 
</P>
<P>
The two stories he wrote that made the biggest splash were about elephant 
poaching and the Kampala golf course, where golfers had to make their putts 
near unexploded grenades. 
</P>
<P>
"One hundred thousand people were being killed and they give all the play to 
elephant poaching," said Lee, shaking his head. "I think we have too much news 
today and it's easy to become desensitized to the horrors of the Third World. I 
think the point of writing plays is that they can make people realize there are 
human beings behind the headlines in Asia and Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Lee wrote a massacre story that got him expelled. He went to a 
village north of Kampala where government troops forced all 27 of the village 
men to dig a pit in a sorghum field, then slashed their throats and pushed them 
in the hole. 
</P>
<P>
Lee found two men who survived by pretending death; he tied one badly injured 
man on his back and rode him via motorcycle to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government didn't hear of the story, which he sent to Associated 
Press, United Press International and Reuters news services, and several 
foreign papers, until it was noticed by Amnesty International, which lodged a 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
After a tense three days of governmental scrutiny that led to his expulsion in 
1982, Lee was offered a position in Beirut by the London Daily Telegraph, but 
turned it down because he wanted to be a fiction writer. 
</P>
<P>
Once he was back in the United States, Lee said, he tried to write about Africa 
and couldn't because the subject was still too painful. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, one of the first things he did when he returned to New York in 1984 
was propose to his wife, Therese Lee (now an AP correspondent in Los Angeles), 
while they stood in the head of the Statue of Liberty -- a symbol he said, of 
how glad he was to be back home. 
</P>
<P>
He tried to capture his African experience in novels (He has three unpublished 
ones in a closet, where, he said, he intends to keep them.). 
</P>
<P>
He then turned to playwriting. But even then, he could not deal with Uganda 
directly at first. 
</P>
<P>
His first play, "California Dog Fight" centered on the violence of illegal 
pit-bull fights, with actual dogs on stage. 
</P>
<P>
It played in New York's Manhattan Theatre Club in 1985, in Los Angeles and in 
London, where it was named the best new play of the year by the London Tribune. 
Lee said the one thing it taught him -- besides the fact that he liked to write 
plays -- was never again to write a script with an animal in it. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter if you have Olivier on stage with a cat. The people will 
watch the cat because you never know what a cat is going to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He now has several plays to his credit including "Paradise," a story about 
Hollywood that was included in the Old Globe Theatre's Play Discovery Series 
last year, and "Pirates," a fantasy about historic female pirates that won the 
South Coast Repertory Theatre's second annual California Playwrights 
Competition. 
</P>
<P>
Lee picked up a $5,000 prize for "Pirates," which will be presented as part of 
SCR's California Play Festival this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Lee began writing "Rebel Armies" in 1986. He mixed what did happen with what 
might have happened in a story about two journalists and two prostitutes that 
he described as "emotionally" -- though not literally -- true. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very painful to write this play," he said quietly. He did 15 drafts 
before its successful run at Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Conn., in 1989. 
The play will be presented later this year by the Bristol Old Vic in London. 
</P>
<P>
Lee still writes poetry and is working on a screenplay for HBO, "Honorary 
White," set in South Africa, and a teleplay for CBS called "A Nation Under 
Siege," set in San Diego, that poses the question of what would happen if the 
army came into cities to fight the drug war. 
</P>
<P>
"A Nation Under Siege" is scheduled to be filmed in the summer and aired in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
The subject matter in Lee's body of work may seem disparate, but they all have 
something important in common, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In every single one of my plays, people make a decision," he said. "Sometimes 
not the right one, but they make a moral decision. 
</P>
<P>
"They are all about people taking responsibility for their lives. These days 
it's easy for people to feel that the world is overwhelming and that they are 
powerless. To me that's a lot of crap. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot individually save the world, but as individuals we can make choices 
about the kind of lives we are going to live."

<P>
Radical reformers including Boris N. Yeltsin and several former political 
prisoners defeated orthodox Communist opponents in many regions, incomplete 
results from elections in three Soviet republics showed today. 
</P>
<P>
But ballots with as many as 20 candidates in a race frustrated the election 
process. Returns from more than half of the 1,068 parliamentary districts in 
the huge Russian Federation were inconclusive, the official news agency Tass 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The inconclusive ballots meant that voters would have to go to the polls again 
in those districts two weeks from now as well as in parts of the Ukraine and 
Byelorussia, the other two republics where elections to parliaments and local 
councils were held Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Complete official results are due March 14. Tass released a handful of results 
and others came from election observers. 
</P>
<P>
The polls, involving 70% of the country's 280 million population, took place 
against a background of rapid political change. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin bested 11 other candidates to win more than 80% of the vote for a seat 
in the Russian Federation parliament from the city of Sverdlovsk. 
</P>
<P>
The white-haired populist said the radicals' gains will make it possible to 
press ahead with reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"The vote gives the possibility to strengthen reforms and allow new measures to 
be taken," the former Moscow party chief and junior Politburo member told 
reporters in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, starting a seven-nation tour promoting 
his autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin would not say whether he will run for president of the Russian 
Federation. The post is currently held by Politburo member Vitaly I. 
Vorotnikov, who also won his election race in a rural district of southern 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
But he threatened to quit the Communist Party if the various blocs are not 
given proportional representation in the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The other reform candidates who won, according to unofficial results gleaned by 
election observers, read like a "Who's Who" of former dissidents and popular 
personalities. 
</P>
<P>
In the Ukraine, two former political prisoners were among leaders of a radical 
opposition alliance that swept into the Ukrainian parliament despite what 
members described as a concerted official campaign against it. 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Horyn and Vyacheslav Chornovil, who between them spent 27 years in 
prison but were released under Kremlin chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev, were among 
leaders of the nationalist Rukh movement who won parliamentary seats from the 
Western Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
In Donetsk, a coal-mining center and recently the scene of frequent strikes, 
several local Communist officials lost their races, according to Interfax, a 
publication of Radio Moscow. It gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Sergei Kovalyov, another former political prisoner and colleague of 
the late human rights campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov, won a seat, according to 
unofficial results collected by pro-reform observers. 
</P>
<P>
In Leningrad, the Democratic Elections 90 pro-reform bloc said its candidates 
are ahead in 30 of 34 parliamentary constituencies, although many will have to 
go through second rounds, and stand to win 80% of seats on local councils.

STATES GET MORE LEEWAY IN DEATH PENALTY RULING

<P>
The Supreme Court today gave state prosecutors greater leeway in what they tell 
juries choosing life or death for convicted murderers, voting 5 to 4 to uphold 
a California man's death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
But the court also voted 6 to 3 to set aside a North Carolina murderer's death 
sentence as it reaffirmed a decision making it easier for capital case jurors 
to consider all "mitigating evidence." 
</P>
<P>
And in a 5-4 ruling in an Oklahoma case, the justices said that telling juries 
to ignore sympathy when sentencing a person to die does not violate the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The decision in the North Carolina case probably will not affect any Death Row 
inmate outside the state, and the two other rulings are not likely to affect 
many of about 2,200 Death Row inmates across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The court's decision in the California death penalty case is a defeat for 
Richard Boyde, who was convicted and sentenced to die for the Jan. 15, 1981, 
murder of Dick Gibson, a Riverside convenience store clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Boyde, then 24, was accompanied by his 19-year-old nephew, Carl 
Ellison, when abducting Gibson during a robbery that netted $33 in cash. Gibson 
was taken to a nearby orange grove and shot. 
</P>
<P>
Ellison also was convicted, and was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The jury that sentenced Boyde was read a list of specific mitigating factors 
that it could consider in choosing his punishment. Jurors were also told that 
they could consider "any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the 
crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime." 
</P>
<P>
Boyde's lawyers argued that the instruction prevented jurors from considering 
factors regarding his background and character that might have been found to be 
mitigating even if they did not lessen the gravity of the crime itself. 
</P>
<P>
The jury was also told that it was required to impose a death sentence if it 
found that aggravating factors outweighed mitigating factors. Boyde's lawyers 
said the mandatory language prevented sentencing jurors from considering his 
case as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
The California Supreme Court decided by a 4-3 vote in 1988 that Boyde had not 
been harmed by the challenged instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Neither instruction is still used in California, however. 
</P>
<P>
In upholding the state court ruling today, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
wrote, "There is not a reasonable likelihood that the jurors in (Boyde's) case 
understood the challenged instructions to preclude considerations of relevant 
mitigating evidence." 
</P>
<P>
In the North Carolina case, the court set aside the death sentence of Dock 
McKoy Jr., convicted of the Dec. 22, 1984, shooting death of Anson County 
Deputy Sheriff William Kress Horne. 
</P>
<P>
Relying on its 1988 ruling in a Maryland case, the high court said the jury 
that sentenced McKoy wrongly was limited in its consideration of mitigating 
factors because jurors were told that they had to agree unanimously on the 
existence of each mitigating factor. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, the system that was condemned is the system we've been using 
since 1977 for sentencing people to death," said Raleigh lawyer Malcolm R. 
Hunter Jr., who represented the Death Row inmate involved in today's decision. 
</P>
<P>
All 85 of the state's current death row inmates were sentenced since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have a very broad impact" in North Carolina, Hunter said of today's 
decision.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District has cited the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department for excessive emissions of methane gas from a 
landfill at the department's jail in Castaic, district officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Studies by AQMD engineers found methane levels four to six times the state 
standard of 50 parts per million, said David Rutherford, an AQMD spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD ordered the Sheriff's Department to install a gas-collection system at 
the dump at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho. Last week Sheriff's Department 
officials requested an exemption from the order, saying recent tests showed low 
levels of methane at the dump. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials denied the request. Unless the Sheriff's Department complies 
with the order, the AQMD is prepared to take the county to court to correct the 
problem, Rutherford said.

ROMANIANS PULL DOWN STATUE OF LENIN

<P>
Demolition workers in Bucharest today finally succeeded in pulling down a 
30-foot statue of V. I. Lenin in Bucharest that had resisted all efforts to 
budge it over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
A squad including workers who recalled dismantling a statue of Josef Stalin in 
1970 after an earlier change in the political wind tried unsuccessfully 
Saturday and Sunday to shift the seven-ton bronze effigy with hoists, a 
demolition ball and blowtorches. 
</P>
<P>
But after more work to detach it from its red granite plinth, cranes swung it 
free today as a crowd of several hundred clapped and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
The new authorities in Bucharest have called the giant likeness of the father 
of the Soviet state a redundant symbol of Romania's Communist past. Mayor Dan 
Predescu says he hopes to auction it off with a starting price of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
If no buyer is found, it may be melted down to make a memorial commemorating 
the December revolution that swept away the regime of Nicolae Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
Predescu said there has been no complaint from the Soviet Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
"The Russians are not very happy," he said, "but they told us that if this is 
what we wanted to do, it is our country."

China has agreed to resume participation in the Fulbright program but on a 
smaller scale than in recent years, the U.S. Embassy said today. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese education officials agreed to send 16 Chinese scholars and students to 
the United States next year to do research, and accept 16 U.S. professors to 
teach, embassy spokesman Sheridan W. Bell said. 
</P>

China took part in the U.S. scholarly exchange program for a decade, with 24 
scholars traveling in each direction in recent years.

It abruptly canceled the 1989-90 academic year exchanges in August in anger 
over U.S. criticism of the army's killing of pro-democracy protesters in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Talks on resuming the exchanges began in December, after U.S. National Security 
Adviser Brent Scowcroft made a fence-mending visit to Beijing.

SOUTH AFRICA SENDS TROOPS TO CISKEI AREA; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELAND: BOTHA SAYS FORCES WILL SUPPRESS RIOTS BY MOBS THAT RAN AMOK AFTER 
MILITARY COUP.

South Africa sent troops into the Ciskei homeland today to suppress riots by 
mobs that burned factories and looted shops after the territory's authoritarian 
president was ousted in a military coup. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha said his government intervened at the 
request of Brig. Gen. Oupa Gqozo of the Ciskei army, who seized power in a 
military coup Sunday in the nominally independent homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Cecilia Makilwane Hospital said three people had been stabbed to 
death and dozens of others injured in the rioting. 
</P>
<P>
Botha said South Africa intervened after mobs threatened to attack government 
buildings in the Ciskei capital of Bisho. He gave no details and did not say 
whether South African forces were involved in fighting with rioters. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word from Gqozo's junta on the developments. 
</P>
<P>
Botha had said earlier that South Africa would not "entertain any request" to 
intervene. He did not say whether South Africa will recognize the new 
government in Ciskei. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 factories, many of them owned by Israeli and Taiwanese firms, were 
set ablaze today as major rioting and looting flared for a second day in 
Mdantsane, a sprawling township and industrial area in eastern Ciskei near the 
South African city of East London, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Mobs attacked and burned businesses and shops in Ft. Jackson, Dimbasa and 
Zwelitsa, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Gqozo said Sunday after the coup that the ultimate aim of the new government of 
Ciskei is to reincorporate it into South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Gqozo said all security forces, including police and prison service officers, 
support the new Council of State. 
</P>
<P>
But order was not being kept today as hundreds of looters, many of them drunk, 
broke into shops, removed the contents and then set buildings ablaze with 
firebombs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"All the shops and factories were burning. . . . Everybody was looting and 
there was complete chaos," an employee at a local hotel said. 
</P>
<P>
Some onlookers tried to stop the looting, but the local police made little 
effort to intervene, eyewitnesses said, adding that some shots were fired, 
apparently by security forces, but there were no reports of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said that the factories were a symbol of the oppressive rule of the 
old government.

Fifteen people, including a lawyer who worked for the Bush presidential 
campaign, were chosen prospective jurors today as the selection process began 
for the Iran-Contra trial of former National Security Adviser John M. 
Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter is charged with five felony counts -- one of conspiracy, two of 
obstructing Congress and two of making false statements to congressional 
committees -- in connection with accusations that he covered up Oliver L. 
North's secret Contra resupply network and lied about a 1985 shipment of Hawk 
missiles to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
He is the highest-ranking Reagan Administration official to go on trial in the 
Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Harold Greene disqualified one woman who expressed 
uncertainty when asked whether she could be fair and impartial. The judge also 
disqualified an equipment operator who said that "when the whole thing was 
going down" following public disclosure of the Iran-Contra affair, "all you 
heard was North and Poindexter." Thirteen of the first 15 in the pool were 
women. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 206 people have filled out questionnaires to be possible jurors for 
the trial, and 76 of them have said they had heard, watched or read portions of 
congressional testimony Poindexter gave in 1987 under a grant of immunity from 
prosecution based on what he said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge approved for the jury pool a real estate lawyer who worked in 
President Bush's campaign as part of a group doing background reviews of 
potential vice presidential candidates. Bush was President Reagan's vice 
president at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The woman also said one of Poindexter's defense lawyers, Joseph Small, had 
baby-sat for her when she was a child. 
</P>
<P>
Iran-Contra Prosecutor Dan Webb questioned whether she should be in the jury 
pool since she knew one of the defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because counsel baby-sat for her doesn't cast any doubt on her," Greene 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman also said a brother-in-law has worked for former Virginia Govs. 
Charles Robb and Gerald Baliles, both Democrats. Robb is now a U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
Also accepted for the jury pool: a clerical worker who said under questioning 
that she knew former Poindexter aide North "was on trial" in the past and that 
he had been fined and was performing community service. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big to-do in D.C.," the woman said 
</P>
<P>
A jury of 12 people and six alternates will be selected from a pool of 
residents from the District of Columbia. Greene is expected to build a pool of 
several dozen prospective jurors from which to select a jury. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those questioned said they knew little about the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
A retired cook, who said she had worked for seven lawyers in the 1950s, said 
she had heard nothing of Poindexter's or North's testimony to Congress.

MOTOROLA SETS ITS COMPUTER SIGHTS HIGH

<P>
Motorola Inc. today unveiled a line of computers that it says should help it 
become a major contender in that industry, where it never has received much 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
The new computers are designed to be operated in a network with machines made 
by other companies, such as IBM and Apple. 
</P>
<P>
They are based on the Unix operating system, which is becoming the industry 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola said the computers undercut the price of a similar line of IBM 
machines by more than 35%. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., has made computers for years, but they 
have primarily been sold to the federal government or to other computer 
companies that resell them under their own name. 
</P>
<P>
The new computers are "file servers," an increasingly popular form of desktop 
or side-of-desk machine that serves as the central data repository for a 
network of desktop terminals. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola's machines, called the MultiPersonal Computer line, range in price 
from $23,985 for the MPC100 to $59,985 for the top-end MPC300. Each comes with 
three desktop screens and a side-of-desk processing unit. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Staiano, president of Motorola's general-systems sector, said the 
company intends to become one of the major players in the computer business 
over the next five years. He says it will build on its expertise in 
computer-chip technology and high-quality, low-cost manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts are skeptical of Motorola's goal. 
</P>
<P>
"Motorola is doing so many great things in other parts of the company, you hate 
to be negative about their computer effort, but I don't think it has too much 
prospect for success," said Richard L. Whittington of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel L. Klesken of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said Motorola is one of 
the leading makers of cellular phones and semiconductors and is "trying to 
build a third leg" with computers.

KAIFU DENIES GIVING BUSH TRADE PROMISE;

<P>
ECONOMICS: JAPAN'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS HE MADE NO SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS DURING 
SUMMIT WITH THE PRESIDENT.

Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said today that he made no specific promises on 
trade issues at his weekend summit with President Bush, de-emphasizing his vow 
in California to "tackle structural reforms" in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not make any promise on any specific issues," Kaifu said in private 
meetings with leaders of his Liberal Democratic Party, according to several 
news reports. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not make any promise on the Structural Impediments Initiative or 
semiconductors," he reportedly said, referring to two subjects of current trade 
talks with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not try to negotiate or arrive at any special agreement," Kaifu later 
said in response to questions in the Diet, the Japanese Parliament. "We did not 
touch at all on (specific trade issues)." 
</P>
<P>
When Kaifu spoke in the United States, he glossed over the lack of specific 
promises and instead emphasized the general commitments made. 
</P>
<P>
In summing up the two-day summit with Bush in Palm Springs, Kaifu said, "I am 
determined to firmly tackle structural reforms of Japan as one of the top 
priorities of my new Cabinet." 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu ran into a storm of criticism at home that he had promised too much to 
Bush and could not deliver. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Finance Ministry and Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry quickly moved to lower expectations about possible movement in trade 
talks with the United States, saying the changes will have to be made slowly. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party denied that Kaifu made 
any commitments. 
</P>
<P>
"Talking and making commitments are different things," said Ichiro Ozawa, the 
top party administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu's critics said he failed to build the consensus needed at home before 
making promises to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"You made promises without making the necessary preparations at home," said 
Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako Doi, who advocates protecting certain 
Japanese markets from foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you tell Bush in clear terms that Japan is against rice imports?" Doi 
asked as she questioned Kaifu in the Diet. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States is willing to have a dialogue with us. Do you really believe 
dialogue is bad?" Kaifu asked Doi. 
</P>
<P>
"To avoid going backward, we must continue cooperating," Kaifu said. "I would 
like to ask for the help and understanding of the whole nation in doing so." 
</P>
<P>
The United States has asked Kaifu to remove such deep-seated barriers to 
imports as Japan's complex distribution system.

Top U.S. trade negotiators told Congress today that they have been disappointed 
with the lack of progress so far in efforts to reduce Japanese barriers to 
American imports. 
</P>
<P>
But the negotiators held out hope that the weekend summit between President 
Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu may re-energize the stalled 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy U.S. Trade Representative S. Linn Williams told a Senate trade 
subcommittee that in the three rounds of talks held so far, little progress has 
been made. He said the Japanese negotiators have raised a number of reasons for 
being unable to make the reforms sought by the American side. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not satisfied with the progress of the talks," Williams said. "The 
basic question is whether the Japanese side sees (the negotiations) as 
damage-control and a public relations exercise or as a substantive effort. On 
that, the jury is still out."

KEATING CUTS HIS SALARY TO $1 IN BANKRUPTCY

<P>
Developer Charles H. Keating Jr., head of the bankrupt American Continental 
Corp. and the subject of numerous lawsuits and criminal probes, has cut his 
salary to $1 a year, the Arizona Republic reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Records filed last week in the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case showed that 
Keating carried through with a promise made last year to reduce his $400,000 
annual salary to a token $1, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Keating had claimed in a national television broadcast in January that he and 
his family were "flat broke." He said his family had been ruined, in part, 
because of heavy investments in the company. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials and investors in American Continental have filed fraud and 
racketeering suits totaling more than $1.3 billion against Keating and other 
American Continental officials. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and other company officers reduced their salaries at the request of the 
committee of unsecured creditors in the American Continental bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Keating's pay cut, the bankruptcy records also showed that Keating's 
son, Charles H. Keating III, and his son-in-law, Robert Hubbard Jr., have been 
taken off the payroll. The younger Keating, an executive vice president, and 
Butler, a vice president, both had been receiving $250,000 annually as of last 
April. 
</P>
<P>
The Republic said federal investigators are trying to determine if Charles 
Keating Jr. and other company executives may be drawing salaries from at least 
eight American Continental subsidiaries that are not covered by the bankruptcy 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Warnicke, a court-appointed examiner in the bankruptcy case, was 
expected to submit a report about the finances of the subsidiaries March 21 to 
U.S. District Judge Richard Bilby.

'THE LAST METRO' WINS CESAR AS TOP FILM OF THE '80S

Francois Truffaut's 1981 film "The Last Metro" was named France's best movie of 
the 1980s today by the 2,500 film professionals who also pick winners of the 
annual Cesar awards, the French Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
In ceremonies Sunday, "Too Beautiful for You," the story of a salesman who 
drops his beautiful wife for a passionate affair with his dumpy secretary, won 
five Cesars, including best film, best director and best screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
"The Last Metro" starred Gerard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve as an actor and 
a theater owner during German-occupied Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu was chosen best actor of the decade. The award for best actress of 
the decade went to Isabelle Adjani for her performances in such films as 
"Camille Claudel." 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s "Super Cesars" were announced today, one day after the 1989 Cesar 
award ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
At Sunday's ceremonies, Bertrand Blier won best director for "Too Beautiful for 
You," and Carole Bouquet, who played the wife, was named best actress. 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu was nominated for best actor in "Beautiful," but the award went to 
Philippe Noiret for his portrayal of a French army officer in the aftermath of 
World War I in "Life and Nothing Else." 
</P>
<P>
The fifth award for "Too Beautiful for You" went to Claudine Merlin for best 
editing. 
</P>
<P>
Best foreign film was "Dangerous Liaisons," by the British director Stephen 
Frears, an adaptation of the 18th-Century French epistolary novel, "Les 
Liaisons Dangereuses" by Choderos de Laclos.

ROONEY RETURN HELPS '60 MINUTES' ROUT RIVALS

Viewer curiosity over Andy Rooney's return to "60 Minutes" after a shortened 
suspension helped the CBS show trounce its competition in preliminary ratings, 
CBS said today. 
</P>
<P>
With Rooney back at work, commenting on his suspension, Sunday's "60 Minutes" 
got a 36% share of the audience and a 22.7 rating in the A.C. Nielsen Co. 
overnight audience estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Those estimates are from 23 cities that collectively represent 45.3% of the 
nation's TV households. The show's share usually averages 32% or 33% in 
overnight ratings. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's "Life Goes On" averaged a 15% cent audience share and a 9.6 rating. NBC's 
Walt Disney movie series was third, averaging a 14% audience share and an 8.5 
rating. National ratings are due Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although still top-rated, "60 Minutes" had begun falling in the ratings since 
Rooney's three-month suspension Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney was suspended without pay after a homosexual-oriented magazine quoted 
him as making disparaging racial remarks. Rooney denied the remarks attributed 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
He had drawn fire earlier from gay-rights groups for a December special on CBS 
in which he cited "homosexual unions" as among the causes of premature deaths. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, CBS News president David Burke, who never specifically said why he 
suspended Rooney, ordered an early lifting of the suspension, allowing the 
commentator to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the return of Andy Rooney had a lot of people tuning in," said CBS 
Research Vice President Michael Eisenberg. "People were curious about the whole 
matter, and we probably picked up people who don't normally watch '60 
Minutes."' 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's "60 Minutes" averaged a 33% share of the audience in New York, and a 
39% share in Los Angeles. In San Francisco, which has a large homosexual 
population, the program averaged a 41% share of the audience, according to 
Eisenberg.

JANET JACKSON SELLS OUT ALL 4 FORUM SHOWS IN 48 MINUTES

Singer Janet Jackson sold out four shows at the Forum in just 48 minutes 
Sunday, with two of the shows instantly added to her schedule to accommodate 
waiting ticket-buyers, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Fans lined up at ticket outlets around Southern California to buy tickets for 
Jackson's announced April 20 and 21 shows and bought out the $22 tickets, at 
four per customer, in 22 minutes, said spokeswoman Maureen O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
With fans still in line, organizers announced that two additional shows will be 
added April 25 and 26. In 48 minutes, the 80,000 tickets for all four shows 
were sold. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's single "Escapade" is No. 1 on Billboard's pop charts, and her album, 
"Rhythm Nation 1814," has sold more than 4 million copies. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said the two extra Forum concert dates were being held in reserve. 
"They were trying to be conservative because she has never toured before. They 
just wanted to see what the market would bear," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old singer's Los Angeles appearances kick off a 100-show, 
nine-month tour. Jackson did not tour after the release of her 1986 album, 
"Control." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the added Los Angeles dates, Jackson's appearances in Oakland have 
been changed to April 28 and 29.

WILLIS IS 'TALKING' BIG MONEY

Bruce Willis makes a better deal than Donald Trump. 
</P>
<P>
Willis put in only three or four days of work in providing the voice for the 
baby in the movie "Look Who's Talking," but it's going to earn him about $10 
million even though he's never seen in the film, according to Premiere 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a flat salary, Willis agreed to take a percentage of the movie's 
gross, and when "Look Who's Talking" became a surprise hit, he reaped a 
windfall that's double what he earned for starring in "Die Hard." Premiere says 
Willis' take exceeds what it cost to make the movie and is more than the 
producers will make.

TRACY CHAPMAN SHUNS FAME

Folk singer Tracy Chapman shuns the fame she quickly found after her 1988 debut 
album soared to the top of the charts and won her three Grammy awards, 
including best new artist. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess if there were some way to choose what I wanted or didn't want from 
what my success has brought me, I would choose not to have the celebrity," 
Chapman said in an interview in the March 12 issue of Time. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'm very good at it." 
</P>
<P>
Chapman's first album, "Tracy Chapman," hit No. 1 on the Billboard pop charts 
and sold 10 million copies. Her second album, "Crossroads," has sold 4 million 
copies since its release five months ago. The albums mix songs protesting 
poverty and racism with love songs. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman, who begins an American tour in May, said she is hurt by criticism of 
her music by other blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people who have gone so far as to say that I'm not black or not part 
of the black musical tradition," she said. "I think the reason I don't get 
played on black radio stations is because I don't fit into their present 
format. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm upset by what has been said because it doesn't speak well of black people. 
You know, it basically says black people don't respond in a cerebral manner to 
music, and that's just not true."

Breaking out of Finger Lake before an eruption by Redoubt Volcano showered the 
trail with sled-slowing ash, four-time champion Rick Swenson was the first 
musher in the Iditarod sled dog race to top the towering Alaska Range today. 
</P>
<P>
Swenson declared his mandatory 24-hour layover after reaching the 3,500-foot 
pass, the highest point on the trail, but it wasn't immediately certain that he 
actually would take it, said race spokeswoman Theresa Daily. 
</P>
<P>
His decision to hold back in Skwentna during the hottest part of the day while 
watching others leave, sparing his dogs and getting a slicker trail, proved to 
be a good one. He left one dog at Finger Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Three-time winner Susan Butcher continued to move up, leaving Finger Lake in 
11th place. She started the race in Anchorage on Saturday as No. 68 of 70 
mushers.

MARYLAND HIT BY PENALTIES FROM NCAA

<TEXT>
<P>
The men's basketball program at Maryland was banned today from 1991 and 1992 
postseason tournaments, prohibited from appearing on television next season and 
placed on three years' probation for major violations of NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
The university must also return $407,378 of its earnings from the 1988 NCAA 
tournament in which the Terrapins advanced to the second round, the NCAA said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The penalties are less than the minimum prescribed for such violations, but the 
NCAA Committee on Infractions deemed Maryland's case unique, saying the school 
had conducted a thorough investigation of the program, cooperated fully with 
investigators, recommended substantial penalties at a hearing and fired members 
of the basketball staff who had violated the rules. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland remains eligible for postseason play this year. Gene Corrigan, 
commissioner of the Atlantic Coast Conference, said he did not see how Maryland 
could play in next year's Atlantic Coast Conference tournament because of the 
television ban. 
</P>
<P>
No limits were placed on recruiting visits, and the number of scholarships for 
the next two years will be limited to 13, a penalty recommended by the 
university itself. The NCAA could have severely restricted recruiting and 
eliminated scholarships for several years. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA cited the university's "failure to meet the principles of 
institutional control and rules compliance, which are among the fundamental 
principles of the association and its members" 
</P>
<P>
University President William Kirwin said the school is disappointed that the 
penalties are so severe and will appeal. He said the sanctions would cost the 
school $3 million in lost revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"The university deeply regrets, indeed is embarrassed by, its violations of 
NCAA rules," he said. "It accepts full responsibility and believes it should 
receive appropriate penalties. I'd like to voice our great disappointment at 
the severity of penalties imposed by the infractions committee." 
</P>
<P>
He said Maryland's cooperation in the investigation appeared to make no 
difference in the severity of the penalties, nor did Maryland's previous 
unblemished record in major violations cases. 
</P>
<P>
"They have imposed all but the most insignificant of sanctions. They could have 
imposed two years of probation and a one-year ban on postseason tournament 
appearances," Kirwin said. "I'm left to wonder how different the sanctions 
would be had we had repeated violations, been uncooperative and not taken 
substantive action." 
</P>
<P>
Maryland has 15 days to appeal to the NCAA Council, which meets in mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
The sanctions penalize Maryland for the 18 rules violations that include 
inducing recruits with free clothing, providing a car for a student athlete and 
selling complimentary ACC tournament tickets. All of the violations occurred 
during the three-year tenure of Coach Bob Wade and were uncovered by an NCAA 
investigation that began last February 
</P>
<P>
Wade was forced to resign last May. The school bought out the final two years 
of Wade's five-year contract.

<P>
The Spurs today filled their 12th roster spot by signing free agent Reggie 
Williams, a Clippers' first-round draft choice in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was signed for the rest of the season, according to a statement issued 
by the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
No contract terms were revealed. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Bass, assistant to the Spurs chairman, said Williams will be in uniform and 
present for the game tonight against the Houston Rockets in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who turned 26 today, was the fourth overall pick in the 1987 draft 
and suffered through an injury-plagued rookie year with the Clippers. In his 
first two NBA seasons with the Clippers, he averaged 10.3 points in 98 games. 
</P>
<P>
This season he was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers along with the signing 
rights to Danny Ferry. The Cavaliers waved Williams on Feb. 24.

"We're pretty sure we know who did it," USU Police Director Larry Arave said.

"It's pretty hard to pull off a caper like this and not leave a trail."

Arave would not identify the suspects or say how they were uncovered, except to 
say they are former USU students and that one of them was seen near the UNLV 
bench, where the water bomb was believed set before game time. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests had been made, and Arave said no further action is anticipated until 
Wednesday. Possible charges could include criminal mischief, trespassing or 
intentionally disturbing a public meeting, he said.

BETTING THE SYSTEMS: FAT FRANKIE CASHES IN ON 1ST, 2ND, 3RD FAVORITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN DASH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Fat Frankie" wears glasses with thick lenses, is almost bald and is truly 
huge. He is a mound of sagging flesh, a contradiction to all health rules, and 
waddles about slowly from his reserved seat in the Santa Anita Race Track 
grandstand to talk to friends, go to the betting windows and visit the 
fast-food stands. Amazingly, after a few years of dieting and exercise, instead 
of losing weight, he is bigger than ever. 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting thing about Fat Frankie is that his race track cronies 
call him "Fat Frankie" to his face. It is like a title, like "Sir," and he 
takes it as such, never showing any anger. His friends believe that if God saw 
fit to make him fat, then he must have other qualities that compensate for such 
a grotesque appearance. And betting on horses is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Fat Frankie doesn't have to work and doesn't even have to win. He and his 
brother have inherited a trucking company. His brother runs the company and 
pays him a weekly salary just to stay away and not interfere with its 
operation. So Fat Frankie goes to the track every day and bets on the horses. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time, Fat Frankie likes to play money management systems. His best 
system, he tells his buddies, is the one he himself devised. What Fat Frankie 
does is bet three horses to win every race. He plays $6 on the favorite, $4 on 
the second choice and $2 on the third choice. This means that Fat Frankie bets 
$12 every race, and if he doesn't cash a ticket, the day's nine races will cost 
him $108. 
</P>
<P>
There is absolutely no handicapping involved in the way Fat Frankie wagers. He 
leaves the betting strictly to the public and chooses his horses just before 
each race. Whatever nags come up as the lowest odds, as they appear one, two 
and three on the totalizator board, Fat Frankie bets on them. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in the second race on opening day of the 1989-90 Santa Anita 
season, the field was as follows: 
</P>
<P>
1. Sterling Pole, $47.60 
</P>
<P>
2. Tozz, 26.50 
</P>
<P>
3. J. L.'s Tribute, 3.20 
</P>
<P>
4. Lam the Iceman, 2.60 
</P>
<P>
5. Don Miguel, 56.70 
</P>
<P>
6. Blaze O'Brien, 3.10 
</P>
<P>
7. For My Friends, 7.40 
</P>
<P>
8. Starlite Special, 4.80 
</P>
<P>
9. Baronet, 14.40 
</P>
<P>
The favorite was Lam the Iceman, Blaze O'Brien was second and J. L.'s Tribute 
was the third choice. 
</P>
<P>
Fat Frankie bet $6 to win on Lam the Iceman, $4 to win on Blaze O'Brien and $2 
to win on J. L.'s Tribute. 
</P>
<P>
Lam the Iceman broke from the No. 4 post position in the six-furlong race for 
2-year-old maidens and took the lead entering the stretch. She romped home a 
winner by two lengths and paid $7.20. Fat Frankie collected $21.60. After 
deducting the $12 he bet, he ended up with a $9.60 profit on the race. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best days for the system was Jan. 12. In the first race, Tell a 
Thief, the favorite, won easily by 1 1/4 lengths, paying $3.60 for every $2 
bet. Although returns for the race came to $10.80, system players lost $1.20. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Portal, second choice in the betting, made a bold move in the stretch to 
win the six-furlong second race by a length and returned $22.80 for the $4 bet. 
Profit on the race amounted to $10.80. 
</P>
<P>
Horsche, the second choice, running a mile for 3-year-old fillies, won the 
third race by a head and returned $14 for $4 and a $2 profit. Winning Port, the 
favorite, returned $19.80 for the $6 bet for a profit of $7.80 in the fourth, a 
six-furlong sprint for 3-year-olds. In the fifth, the second favorite, Dime 
Time, won the mile race, paying $20.40 for the $4 bet. Profit was $8.40. 
</P>
<P>
Forsaken Toy, a second choice, hit the stretch two lengths in front in a six 
furlong sprint and easily won the sixth race by three lengths. It paid $20.80 
for the $4 bet, for a $8.80 profit. In the seventh, another second choice, 
Fluzie Forbes, romped home a winner by a length and paid $15.60 for $4. Profit 
on the race was $3.60. 
</P>
<P>
The eighth race, Criminal Type was the third choice. It broke from the No. 7 
post position and ran fourth behind the leaders until the stretch, where it 
made its move. By the finish, Criminal Type was in front by 1 1/4 lengths and 
won easily, paying a low $4.80 for $2. Loss on the race was $7.80. In the 
ninth, no horse won. Fat Frankie lost $12. 
</P>
<P>
For the day, Fat Frankie bet $108. He cashed in $129 worth of tickets and ended 
up the day with a profit of $21. 
</P>
<P>
Another good day for the system was Jan. 18. Midday Melody, one of two 
favorites, won the first race, returning $22.80 for $6. In the second, Legal 
Tender, the third choice, returned $10.20 for $2, and in the third, Noble Dr., 
the second choice, won and paid $16.80 for $4. 
</P>
<P>
Drone's Queen, the second choice, won the fourth, paying $25.20 for $4 and 
Princess of Ice, a second choice, won and paid $21.60 for $4 in the fifth. 
Kinetic Kid, the second choice, won and paid $14.40 for $4 in the sixth and 
Golden Soldier, a third choice, paid $10.80 for $2 in winning the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth race, Tokatee, the second choice, returned $17.20 for $4. All 
three choices ran out in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Fat Frankie won $31 for the day after betting a total $108 for all nine races 
and getting back $139 in winnings. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Fat Frankie will admit that there are other money management 
systems, some worse, some better than his. 
</P>
<P>
However, what Fat Frankie likes about his $6-$4-$2 system is that since the 
first, second and third choices win about 60% of the races, he gets a lot of 
action for his money and cashes in lots of tickets. Not everyone can say that. 
</P>
<P>
He also likes to theorize about his system. "Picking winners has to do with 
numbers and percentages," he will tell anyone who will listen. "If you pick the 
right numbers, you win; if you don't, you lose." 
</P>
<P>
Most bettors, however, like to point out that it is not that simple. Having 
confidence is a good thing, but no matter how you figure the percentages and 
tackle the numbers, you're still taking a chance. Despite what some 
handicappers believe, horse racing isn't known for its sure things.
