HIGH RISK MEANS LOWER RATES FOR SOME DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It used to be that virtually all those insured under the California Automobile 
Assigned Risk Plan were drivers with bad records, who paid extremely high rates 
so that they could comply with the state's minimum liability coverage 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Such drivers were assigned to insurance companies in proportion to each firm's 
share of the state's auto insurance market. The premiums were high enough that 
the companies did not lose money on their assigned-risk customers. 
</P>
<P>
Not so anymore. In some parts of Los Angeles, assigned-risk rates, which are 
regulated by the state insurance commissioner, are lower than the rates charged 
for regular coverage. The insurance companies say they are losing money on the 
state's 780,000 assigned-risk policyholders, especially in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
Assigned risk has become such a good deal for urban drivers that many with good 
records now choose to participate in the Assigned Risk Plan, which was 
specifically devised to serve the problem driver. 
</P>
<P>
According to the insurance executives who hold a majority of seats on the 
Assigned Risk Plan board, the companies in 1987, the latest year for which 
statistics are available, incurred $1.94 in claims and expenses for every 
dollar they collected from their assigned-risk drivers, resulting in a 
$262-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The insurers reported that, on the average, it was costing the 13 million 
regularly insured California drivers about $20 a year each to subsidize the 
assigned-risk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1947, California's assigned-risk system has undergone a series of 
dramatic changes during the Administraton of Republican Gov. George Deukmejian: 
</P>
<P>
* Two consecutive Deukmejian-appointed insurance commissioners, Bruce Bunner 
and Roxani Gillespie, have held down assigned-risk rates in urban areas, 
particularly Los Angeles, repeatedly refusing to approve rate increases that 
the Assigned Risk Plan board says are needed to put the system on a 
pay-as-you-go basis. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie has said that because such rate increases would make insurance 
unaffordable for high-risk drivers, many such drivers would go without 
insurance, despite the state's mandatory insurance law. That, in turn, would 
send premiums for the uninsured motorist coverage carried by most people 
soaring. 
</P>
<P>
* Citing the actions by Bunner and Gillespie to keep a lid on assigned-risk 
rates, insurance companies say they now are losing $1 million each working day 
providing such coverage. When State Farm announced a statewide average rate 
increase of 9.6% on Jan. 30, the company said that in the 12 months ending Nov. 
30, it had lost more than $100 million on its assigned-risk customers. 
</P>
<P>
* The companies note with alarm that in an ever-spreading area of Central, East 
and South Los Angeles, assigned-risk policies providing the required minimum 
liability coverage are cheaper than regular policies for the same coverage. 
Allstate Insurance executives say the same policy they sell in Central Los 
Angeles for $1,314 can be obtained through the Assigned Risk Plan for $850. But 
in most of the state, where regular rates are far lower than in Central Los 
Angeles, assigned risk still costs more than regular policies. 
</P>
<P>
* The public has been slow to catch on to the good deal being offered under 
assigned risk, and many drivers with good records are still leery of the 
assigned-risk plan because of its past reputation for insuring only the poor 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the number of assigned-risk policyholders has more than doubled in 
the last three years. They account for 6% of all California policyholders. In 
some parts of Los Angeles, more than 25% of all insured drivers are 
assigned-risk policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
Contending that the situation is fast reaching crisis proportions, the 
insurance industry has gone on the offensive. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 7, the Assigned Risk Plan governors announced they will seek a 112.3% 
average statewide increase in assigned-risk auto rates and a 137% increase in 
Los Angeles. If the increase are approved, the average statewide rate would 
rise from about $700 to nearly $1,500 and would exceed $2,000 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The governors emphasized that "the requested rates will provide no profit to 
participating insurers nor will the rates recoup past deficits." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regular Coverage 
</P>
<P>
However, the increase, if approved, would make it impossible for drivers to get 
assigned-risk policies cheaper than regular ones, presumably restoring the 
incentive for cost-conscious good drivers to buy regular coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"The large deficits incurred by the plan's participating insurers cause drivers 
in the voluntary market to subsidize drivers in the assigned-risk market," the 
Assigned Risk board said in a statement asking for the rate increase. "The 
plan's governing committee believes that voluntary market drivers should not 
bear the cost for assigned-risk drivers." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie reacted cooly to the group's request. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a month has gone by, and Gillespie has yet to call the required public 
hearing that would legally have to precede any increase authorized by her. A 
spokeswoman said last week that the Insurance Department staff is continuing a 
review of the matter and would not say when a hearing will be called. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Assigned Risk Plan governors called for a rate increase, 
asking for 50% in two stages in December, 1987, Gillespie took a year to rule, 
and she then gave them only an 18.5% increase in one stage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Voluntary Market' 
</P>
<P>
In their statement this year, the governors remarked: "The (Assigned Risk) plan 
was intended to be self-sufficient; the statute and regulations do not call for 
(it) to be subsidized by the voluntary market." 
</P>
<P>
But Gillespie said last week that she does not think the law requires her to 
make assigned-risk customers pay their own way. 
</P>
<P>
"The law is silent on this point," she said. "The silence is total and 
complete." 
</P>
<P>
Although Gillespie declines to say what she will do with the rate increase 
request, her comments indicate that she does not intend to give the Assigned 
Risk Plan governors everything they want. The last time the board made such a 
request, Gillespie promptly declared she would not give anywhere near the 50% 
increase they had requested. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the insurers, ever more concerned that they are being saddled with an 
increasing number of assigned-risk customers, are expressing nervousness. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Zax, chief executive of Zenith Insurance Co. and the immediate past 
president of the Assn. of California Insurance Companies, the industry's most 
important Sacramento lobbying agent, recently said he feared that Gillespie was 
using the assigned-risk system to undercut the so-called territorial rating 
approach, under which insurers charge the highest rates for regular policies 
sold to drivers living in congested urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the assigned-risk rates have been held down most in the four 
urban rating zones, while in six suburban and rural rating zones, they have not 
been held down very much. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Rating Issue' 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's the territorial rating issue revisited in a different fashion," 
Zax declared. "It's talking about redistributing the wealth." 
</P>
<P>
A similar point was made by Rex Davis, a group president for Allstate, who said 
the disparity between assigned-risk and regular policy rates is so large in Los 
Angeles "that we fear a disruption of the voluntary (insurance) market." 
</P>
<P>
The insurers say that by keeping the assigned-risk rates so low, the insurance 
commissioner is in effect providing a subsidy to drivers in high-risk areas, 
one that can only be supported by charging other drivers more for their 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said that if Gillespie feels a need to provide "a subsidy of a large 
magnitude, then government has to get involved in that subsidy, perhaps by 
providing insurance stamps" for those unable to afford insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"It is government which is designed to redistribute the wealth, not private 
corporations" the insurance executive said. "But I recognize there is a danger 
this could lead to state insurance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Budget Problems 
</P>
<P>
So far, neither Gillespie nor any legislator has proposed an official state 
subsidy such as insurance stamps. Such a proposal would likely run into 
opposition at a time when the state is facing severe budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Foley of the Alliance of American Insurers, who is chairman of the 
Assigned Risk Plan governing board, turned down a request for an interview on 
whether a subsidy for assigned-risk customers is warranted. A spokesman, 
attorney James R. Woods, said Foley and other members of the governing board 
believe that their function is to recommend what they considered adequate rates 
to Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidy matter "is not an issue that we're prepared to deal with," Woods 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Woods warned that even the 112.3% increase in rates the governors are 
requesting would not actually be sufficient to erase the deficit incurred by 
the companies in providing assigned-risk coverage now. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, we were citing only 1987 figures," he said. "When the 1988 figures 
come in, the deficit will be even higher." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gearing Up for a Fight 
</P>
<P>
But consumer groups are already gearing up to oppose the proposed increase when 
Gillespie holds a public hearing on the issue. Harry Snyder, West Coast 
director of the Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, said 
he was not worried that the commissioner would give the insurers everything 
they want in terms of an increase. 
</P>
<P>
"This has become a PUC (Public Utilities Commission) kind of game," he 
remarked. "They (the insurers) always ask for more than they expect to get. 
</P>
<P>
"But the question here is, if Gillespie gives them anything, will assigned-risk 
coverage become unaffordable and will it drive people to become uninsured. If 
anything, we should increase the subsidy." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a legal dispute rages among the insurance companies about what 
is termed the lack of equity in the way assigned-risk customers are apportioned 
to the various companies. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on the complaints of several companies, the Assigned Risk Plan governors 
in late 1987 passed a motion requiring the California State Auto Assn., the 
Northern California counterpart of the Automobile Club of Southern California, 
to start offering coverage to assigned-risk customers in the Los Angeles area, 
even though it normally does no business south of the Tehachapi Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lower Price 
</P>
<P>
The governors decided this gave the Northern California association an unfair 
competitive advantage, because it did not have to incur the very heavy 
assigned-risk deficits involved in doing business in the Los Angeles area, 
while the other companies, competing with the auto association in Northern 
California, did. This, presumably, would allow the auto association to offer 
insurance at a lower price in its area of operations. 
</P>
<P>
The association, however, sued to prevent implementation of the rule ordering 
it into the Los Angeles assigned-risk market and obtained a stay that is still 
in effect.

NEW-STYLE ELECTION ALTERING SOVIET POLITICAL LANDSCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Profound political changes are under way in the Soviet Union as the country 
prepares this month for its first contested parliamentary elections since the 
earliest days of the Soviet state. 
</P>
<P>
A dramatic upsurge in political activism at the grass-roots level has followed 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's pledge that the Communist Party will end its 
70-year monopoly on power and seek instead to play a leading -- but no longer 
all-controlling -- role in the government. 
</P>
<P>
New constitutional structures -- a powerful national parliament, an executive 
presidency, strengthened regional and local governments -- should be in place 
within months of the March 26 elections, and Gorbachev has declared his 
determination to use them to push through further reforms. 
</P>
<P>
A new political culture is being created at the same time, one that fosters 
popular participation, encourages debate, permits dissent and is already 
challenging the party. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev calls the process "a vast school of democracy" for the country and 
sees it as the key to his overall effort to transform the entire Soviet 
political and economic system. 
</P>
<P>
"It is already clear that we are not dealing with merely a formal procedure but 
with genuine elections of people's representatives to the highest organs of 
power," Gorbachev said as the country entered a month of formal campaigning. 
"This is an enormous step forward from the practice of previous years." 
</P>
<P>
The changes are not aimed at turning the Soviet Union into a liberal Western 
democracy but at reshaping and redefining socialism. The Communist Party has 
made it clear that its interest is in sharing power, not forsaking it. 
</P>
<P>
The election process has not been smooth. These are the Soviet Union's first 
multi-candidate, nationwide elections in memory. Most of the procedures have 
never been used before, and confusion has been widespread. 
</P>
<P>
Those who fear the loss of power frequently have been ruthless in dealing with 
their opponents to ensure that they win -- effectively demonstrating that real 
power is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Although the difficulties have discouraged many liberals who had hoped the 
elections would be "the dawn of democracy," as one writer put it, most of the 
country's senior political analysts rank the changes, in terms of potential, 
second only to the 1917 Revolution, which overthrew the czarist regime and 
brought the Bolsheviks to power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Huge Impact on Country 
</P>
<P>
"We are witnessing very great shifts in political consciousness, which the 
elections have awakened and brought to a high level," Prof. Boris Grushin, 
deputy director of the Center for Public Opinion Research, said last week in an 
interview. "There has been a huge impact across the country. Many things that 
once were so certain no longer are. The scale of change is hard to predict, and 
it is not irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been procedural difficulties, to be sure, but we are also 
accumulating important experience, which I believe will expand and accelerate 
the process of change." 
</P>
<P>
Extraordinary scenes, all the more dramatic after years of political passivity, 
have unfolded across the nation in the last two months of preliminary 
campaigning for the new Congress of People's Deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran party officials, whose word has virtually been law, have been cast 
aside in dozens of constituencies in favor of determined reformers -- also 
party members but from the rank and file -- as they stand for election to the 
congress. 
</P>
<P>
Meetings that even three years ago would have been broken up by police as 
illegal "anti-Soviet agitation" now fill community centers, labor union halls 
and school auditoriums almost every night, drawing overflow crowds and 
continuing for 12 hours or more. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Party Policies Under Attack 
</P>
<P>
Party policies, unchallengeable for so long as "the will of the working class," 
are under unprecedented attack -- from workers, farmers and intellectuals alike 
and from within the party as much as from outside. 
</P>
<P>
Even V. I. Lenin, the Bolshevik revolutionary who founded the Soviet state and 
who has been revered here as politically infallible, is being criticized. 
Lenin, it is said, pushed the party into its long monopoly on power, now 
regarded as the root of the country's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The most zealous optimist could not have imagined such an outburst of public 
activity," the Communist Party newspaper Pravda commented last week, expressing 
amazement at the upsurge in the country's new, participatory politics. "Today, 
public activity is the main factor determining the political atmosphere across 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
At times, the Soviet Union's emboldened people appear ready to storm the 
citadels of power with their new energy and excitement -- and yet it is the 
Communist Party, under Gorbachev, that deliberately set all these events in 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
The elections are a first step toward the redistribution of power that is at 
the heart of perestroika, or restructuring, as Gorbachev's program of 
political, economic and social reforms is known. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lethargy and Paralysis 
</P>
<P>
In proposing major constitutional changes last year, Gorbachev argued that the 
concentration of political, economic and social decision-making in the 
Communist Party had led to national lethargy and paralysis. The party had to be 
subordinated to the state, he said, and it had to share power at all levels of 
the government and step back from the day-to-day management of the economy and 
society. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to create a system that makes decisions democratically and with full 
public participation," Otto Latsis, deputy chief editor of the party journal 
Kommunist, commented in an interview last week. "Otherwise, there not only will 
be no fundamental restructuring but only a reversion to the repression of the 
past. . . . And that, we know, does not work." 
</P>
<P>
Under changes to the constitution, proposed by Gorbachev at a special party 
conference last June and enacted in December, three houses of 750 deputies each 
will be elected to the Congress of People's Deputies this month. 
</P>
<P>
One house of this "super-parliament" is being elected on the basis of 
territorial constituencies, another will be elected on the basis of regional 
and ethnic representation and the third will be chosen from "public 
organizations," including the Communist Party, labor unions, the Soviet Women's 
Committee, veterans' groups and academic bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Although this congress will exercise what the Soviet constitution calls supreme 
power, it will meet perhaps only once a year. From among its own members it 
will elect the Supreme Soviet, a parliamentary body with broad authority to 
enact legislation and to supervise government operations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus of Political Action 
</P>
<P>
This will make the Supreme Soviet the focus of political action, many here 
believe, and Gorbachev clearly intends to use its popular mandate to overcome 
bureaucratic opposition to his reforms and to broaden and accelerate them. 
</P>
<P>
"If Gorbachev has five more years with hostile people, if he cannot get people 
into the Supreme Soviet who support change, he will not survive," said Vitaly 
A. Korotich, the crusading editor of the popular weekly magazine Ogonyok, 
explaining the importance to Gorbachev's reform effort of both the elections 
and the constitutional changes they implement. 
</P>
<P>
With about 450 members and sitting for three or four months twice a year, the 
new Supreme Soviet is supposed to have real debates on legislation and to 
exercise a controlling influence on the power of the party -- in contrast to 
the old Supreme Soviet, which amounted to a parliamentary rubber stamp, 
approving everything put before it during its semiannual meetings of two days 
each. 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet -- certain to be Gorbachev 
-- will have executive authority, act as the country's president and be 
responsible to the Supreme Soviet and the Congress of People's Deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"The work of deputies will change immensely," Guri Marchuk, president of the 
Soviet Academy of Sciences and a member of the old Supreme Soviet for more than 
a decade, predicted as he campaigned last week for the new congress. "We took 
formal decisions on proposals that had been previously 'approved' by some 
(party or government) departments and other bodies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Principled Decisions' 
</P>
<P>
"The election campaign has shown that members of Parliament will both table 
questions (directed to government ministers) and will openly discuss problems 
and take independent and principled decisions on them." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, members of the Supreme Soviet have been elected on 
ballots with only a single name -- that of the candidate chosen by party 
officials -- and the result was usually an approval rate of 98% or 99%. The 
Soviet Union last held contested elections in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
"When you consider how we used to justify those old, one-candidate elections as 
expressions of the 'people's approval' for party policy, then you will realize 
how fundamental a change multi-candidate elections are for us," Fyodor 
Burlatsky, a leading political scientist, said while campaigning for the 
congress. 
</P>
<P>
"The new structure, though still a one-party system, is based on pluralism, not 
the political monotheism of the past. Now, candidates must put forward their 
own programs, party policies will be judged on their merits against other 
alternatives and party members must compete with everyone else. That is the 
starting point, and it can make the Supreme Soviet our central political 
institution where all trends, all opinions and alternative programs converge." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of New Faces 
</P>
<P>
As he presses forward with his reform program, Gorbachev clearly intends to 
work as much through the new governmental structures as through the party 
organization. With hundreds of new faces, the new parliamentary bodies should 
be more committed to reform than the bureaucracy has been, and the majority of 
their members will have campaigned on platforms of active reform. 
</P>
<P>
"With elections, deputies for the first time will feel the pressure of popular 
dissatisfaction," Mikhail Poltoranin, a leading political commentator and a 
candidate to represent the Union of Journalists in the new congress, said in an 
interview. "They will come not just with a vaguish mandate for change but with 
a real feeling that if changes don't come quickly, this country will explode." 
</P>
<P>
As he campaigns, Poltoranin tells voters: "Send me there to fight. As a deputy, 
I would work to include my program, the one that you elected me on, in the 
government's policies and directly in legislation, along with your directives 
-- and then I would follow up." 
</P>
<P>
He said in the interview, "It seems so obvious, but never has a candidate for 
the Supreme Soviet been able to say that and mean it." 
</P>
<P>
Competition has been intense in most places, first for nominations and now for 
the elections themselves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7,531 Candidates Nominated 
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Electoral Commission, 7,531 candidates were nominated 
by workers' collectives, groups of residents and other organizations for the 
1,500 territorial and regional constituencies -- an average of five per seat. 
But in some districts, as many as 20 candidates were fielded, while only one 
was nominated in about 180 places. 
</P>
<P>
In a complex, often controversial second stage, the number of candidates was 
reduced to two in nearly 1,000 constituencies under rules taken by some 
officials as intended to ensure a clear winner March 26, rather than a runoff 
election two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
Many anti-establishment candidates, most of them liberals, appear to have been 
squeezed out in this process. Party bosses in many districts packed the 
meetings with supporters to ensure their candidates' selection. In some places, 
police reportedly blocked streets leading to the meetings or admitted only 
those with special tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those selection meetings nearly degenerated into riots -- the Soviet 
press called them "stormy," "tumultuous" and "volcanic" -- as competing 
candidates' supporters battled for the right to speak. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet press, freed from many past restrictions, has engaged in some of the 
roughest polemics of all, bringing charges from candidates, again largely from 
the left, of distortion and libel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Things Can Get Pretty Nasty' 
</P>
<P>
"We are discovering there are a lot of ways to 'steal an election,' as 
Americans put it, but they are all new to us," Anatoly Rubinov, a veteran 
journalist who enjoys his reputation as a muckraker, said after being defeated 
by the "party machine" in a district northeast of Moscow. "Things can get 
pretty nasty." 
</P>
<P>
Now, in a quarter of the constituencies -- many of them in the Ukraine, where 
the conservative party machine sought to eliminate any opposition -- there will 
be only a single name on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Korotich, who stalked out to protest what he called the "rigging" of the Moscow 
meeting where his nomination was being considered, spoke for many disappointed 
liberals when he called the election process a "regulated democracy." 
</P>
<P>
In more than 200 districts, however, there will be three or more candidates, 
including 12 in a Moscow constituency. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary analysis by the Central Electoral Commission shows there will 
probably be shifts in the composition of the new legislature: more 
professionals, fewer workers and farmers, fewer women and young people, and 
fewer party and government workers, but more party members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rank-and-File Members 
</P>
<P>
"Party members -- those from the rank and file, not the bosses -- are winning 
significant support because they have thought-through positions, they are 
better organized and show political maturity," Rubinov said. "And I am talking 
about those nomination meetings that have been fair." 
</P>
<P>
One Moscow newspaper complained last week that it could not distinguish the 
candidates' programs one from another. But the heated debates among candidates 
and their supporters, along with citizens' questions at the election meetings, 
made it clear that the key issue of the election is not perestroika and its 
goals but how it can be speeded up. 
</P>
<P>
"Perestroika is simply marching in place," Boris Bondarev, a candidate in 
Moscow's Kuntsevo district, told a rally. "How do we move on? How do we go 
faster? How do we get results? Those are the central questions." 
</P>
<P>
And on those questions there is wide debate, varying with the candidates and 
their backgrounds, with the voters, with localities, according to press 
accounts and people who have attended many meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"For issues to narrow, to coalesce, people have to be speaking the same 
language, and we don't," Grushin said. "We are just developing a political 
language to express our own ideas, rather than the thoughts that we have been 
given. So, when a person says one thing, others understand another." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inflation, Low Pensions 
</P>
<P>
Besides the pace of perestroika, certain other common concerns are also clear 
-- inflation, low pensions, undiminished government bureaucracy, defense 
spending and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be said that people were afraid to speak, to raise problems, to 
criticize, but I never thought so," Grushin said. "It was either that they did 
not have anything to say that differed with whatever had been decreed from on 
high, or they lacked the language to articulate their positions. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what is changing, and that change will have greater ramifications than 
the results of the election itself . . . because it means a new political 
culture here, really a new way of doing things." 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts, in fact, are already looking beyond these elections toward 
those for local and regional governments in the autumn. 
</P>
<P>
"There is much more room to maneuver at lower levels, and the changes will come 
even faster there," Latsis said. "People will have more experience, they will 
be able to organize themselves more effectively and the issues will be closer 
to home." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impact on People's Lives 
</P>
<P>
Those elections, journalist Rubinov says, will have "an even deeper impact on 
people's lives. At the national level, big decisions are made, but at the local 
level is where they make or break people. 
</P>
<P>
"This political process is not going to stop with these elections," he added. 
"It is going to grow and grow. A lot of new people are coming into politics 
now, and they will run in those local elections. Then the new people will be 
agitating from below, while the old ones, who may make it through to the 
Supreme Soviet, try to retain their hold from above. And it won't work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENTAL OVERHAUL 
</P>
<P>
Soviet voters go to the polls March 26 in the first contested parliamentary 
elections since the 1920s. The elections are the initial step in a fundamental 
redistribution of constitutional authority that will strip the Communist Party 
of its monopoly on power. The Soviet Union will remain a one-party state but 
the new governmental structure is designed to encourage greater public 
participation and debate. The new structure: 
</P>
<P>
Congress of People's Deputies: This new "super-parliament" will, under the 
constitution, exercise supreme power. It will meet perhaps once a year and will 
consist of three houses of 750 delegates each. One house will represent 
territorial constituencies, the second ethnic and regional constituencies and 
the third "public organizations," such as the party, labor unions, women's and 
veterans' groups and academic bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Supreme Soviet: This parliament will be composed of 450 members chosen by the 
members of the Congress of People's Deputies, and it is expected to be the 
focus of political action with broad authority to enact legislation and to 
supervise government operations. It will meet three or four times a year in 
contrast to the existing Supreme Soviet, which met semiannually for two days 
each to "rubber stamp" directives of the party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet: The executive body of the Supreme Soviet is to 
be composed of the chairman and a number of vice chairmen and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet: In effect, this leader will be 
the national president and top executive authority, elected by the Supreme 
Soviet and responsible to it and to the Congress of People's Deputies. The post 
almost certainly will go to the current Soviet president, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, 
champion of the reforms.

6 MORE NATIONS AGREE TO SIGN OZONE ACCORD; 
</P>
<P>
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OPENS IN LONDON WITH FLURRY OF ACTION ON CURBING 
CHEMICALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Confronted with mounting evidence that the Earth faces an unprecedented 
environmental crisis, six more nations announced Sunday that they will sign an 
international accord to rid the atmosphere of ozone-destroying chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
The six nations that said they will sign the landmark Montreal Protocol are 
Austria, Hungary, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago, the Philippines and Zambia. 
</P>
<P>
The protocol, first approved in 1987 and signed and ratified by 32 countries, 
commits industrialized nations to cut their use and production of 
ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by 50% by the turn of the century. 
Developing countries are given an additional 10 years to comply. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ranking environmental official of the 12-nation European 
Community disclosed that he will recommend that Europe go a step further than 
it did three days ago in Brussels, when community ministers surprised both the 
United States and Britain by endorsing a total phase-out of the chemicals by 
the turn of the century, a position Washington took the following day. 
</P>
<P>
EC Environment Commissioner Carlo Ripa Di Meana said he will push for a 
phase-out as early as 1996 or 1997, a position strongly endorsed by private 
environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico and Switzerland also announced Sunday that they will accelerate the 
phase-out of CFCs, and Japan announced that it will host a major Asian-Pacific 
ozone conference next fall to enlist more support for the protocol. 
</P>
<P>
The fast-breaking developments came on the opening day of an international 
ozone conference called by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. They were 
viewed as evidence of growing diplomatic momentum for prompt action to end the 
chemical disintegration of the ozone layer that protects all life on Earth from 
lethal levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
In the words of Swiss delegate Flavio Cotti, "The time has come for a universal 
response to a universal challenge." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressure to Sign 
</P>
<P>
Despite careful disclaimers by Thatcher before the three-day conference that 
non-signatory governments would not be urged to make commitments to sign the 
protocol, it was clear that they were coming under intense pressure from many 
of the 124 nations in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
President Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya, who delivered the keynote address, 
declared: "Let us all accept the fact that the threat to the ozone layer is a 
global problem whose disastrous effects have no national boundaries. It calls 
for a mobilization of political will, international cooperation and genuine and 
equitable sacrifice from all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Moi's remarks as the president of a developing country took on added 
significance because many of the holdouts are Third World nations that either 
view ozone depletion and global warming as issues which pale in importance to 
the need for economic development, or want assurances before signing of 
technological and economic assistance to help them comply. 
</P>
<P>
Among the developing nations of most concern that have not signed the protocol 
are China and India. In addition, delegates from the Soviet Union said Sunday 
that more scientific data is needed before the Kremlin will consent to 
strengthening the protocol, which it has signed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Third World Development 
</P>
<P>
A number of countries, including the European Community group, said there is 
concern that as industrialized nations phase out CFCs, developing countries 
will take up the slack and defeat global efforts to enjoin the ozone 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Irving Mintzer, a research scientist with the Washington-based World Resources 
Institute, said in a recent study that if just four developing countries -- 
China, India, Indonesia and Brazil -- increase their domestic consumption of 
CFCs to the levels allowed by the protocol, CFC production on a worldwide basis 
would double from the 1986 base level. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, both U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator 
William K. Reilly and Di Meana of the European Community said that economic and 
technological aid would be necessary to help developing countries switch to 
safer substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
While Reilly could not be specific as to funds, Di Meana said that a portion of 
the $10 billion that the community budgets for aid to 66 African, Caribbean and 
Pacific states would be earmarked for this purpose. Reilly disclosed that the 
United States has already opened talks with China and would do so with India. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thatcher Remarks 
</P>
<P>
In her welcoming address, Thatcher said that environmental issues have come to 
preoccupy governments and people more than ever before. She added that she is 
convinced that "we need to go further and act faster" than the protocol now 
requires. The targeted chemicals -- chlorofluorocarbons used in refrigeration, 
air conditioning, cleaning computer chips and in the manufacture of foam 
products -- are destroying the Earth's ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
Another category of destructive chemicals are halons, which are used in fire 
suppressants. The protocol does not require a rollback in the use of halons, 
only a freeze to 1986 levels. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly announced Sunday that the Bush Administration, in calling for a total 
phase-out of the chemicals, included halons as well as chlorofluorocarbons. 
That was not made clear when the President made the announcement last Thursday 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly also denied that the Bush Administration was allowing itself a loophole 
on missing the phase-out deadline by conditioning it on the availability of 
environmentally sound alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Some environmentalists have warned that without a certain deadline, industry 
may slow its pace in finding replacements. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly said that based on talks with industry leaders, he is confident 
substitutes will be found. 
</P>
<P>
Du Pont Co., one of the world's leading producers of CFCs, announced Sunday 
that it has two "long-term candidates" for replacing CFCs that are used as 
cleaning agents by electronic companies. 
</P>
<P>
Cleaning agents, used in the production of computer chips, account for about 
20% of the world market for CFCs. Du Pont Group Vice President Archie W. Dunham 
said in London that with the latest chemical candidates, the company now has 
good substitute prospects for all major CFC markets, including refrigeration, 
blowing agents, cleaning agents and aerosols. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Danger to Continue 
</P>
<P>
Because of previous and current emissions of these chemicals, it is likely that 
the ozone layer will continue to be thinned. Scientists say that if action is 
undertaken quickly, the ozone depletion can be reduced but not reversed for at 
least 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1935, there were no CFCs in the atmosphere. But since the mid-1970s, 
atmospheric concentrations have grown annually at an average rate of 5% to 7% 
according to the EPA. There is early evidence that halons have increased at the 
rate of 20% per year during the past decade, the EPA said. 
</P>
<P>
The life of various CFCs range from 75 to 120 years, and they provoke what UC 
Irvine Prof. Sherwood Rowland called a chain reaction that destroys the ozone 
shield, with one CFC molecule destroying 100,000 ozone molecules. It was 
Rowland and a colleague who first warned in 1974 of the danger posed to the 
ozone layer by these chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever happens to the atmosphere is going to stay for a long time," Rowland 
told a meeting here of environmentalists that preceded the Thatcher conference. 
</P>
<P>
Since a team of British scientists discovered the so-called ozone hole over the 
Antarctic in 1985, similar but less severe phenomena have been detected over 
the Arctic. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, scientists have found that there are enough chemical pollutants 
in the Arctic to deplete the ozone layer there at the staggering rate of 1% a 
day if climatic conditions are right. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disturbing Findings 
</P>
<P>
The Arctic findings are particularly disturbing because, unlike the South Pole, 
a good deal of the world's population resides in the northern latitudes. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. EPA study graphically pointed out the dangers of a thinning ozone 
shield -- heightened risks of damage to the human eye, including cataracts, 
potential impairment of the human immune system and additional skin cancers.

TIBET RIOTERS, POLICE CLASH; 11 DIE, 100 HURT

Eleven people were killed and more than 100 others were injured in the Tibetan 
capital of Lhasa on Sunday in a clash between pro-independence protesters and 
police, according to an official Chinese news report. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began around noon when 13 Buddhist monks and nuns staged a protest 
march around central Lhasa's Jokhang Temple, carrying banners and shouting, 
"Independence for Tibet!" the official New China News Agency reported early 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The protest escalated into widespread rioting that left one policeman and 10 
protesters dead after police opened fire, the news agency reported. It said 
that some of the protesters had firearms and shot at police. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fired Warning Shots 
</P>
<P>
Western tourists in Lhasa who spoke by telephone with reporters in Beijing said 
that police used tear gas and fired warning shots to try to control the 
protesters but eventually shot directly into crowds of rioters. 
</P>
<P>
Fleeing protesters carrying the banned "mountains and snow lion" flag of 
Tibetan independence were shown in a front-page picture today in the official 
People's Daily. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the demonstration began, "several hundred people joined the 
paraders, and they started throwing stones at a police station," the news 
agency said. "By 3 p.m., more than 600 rioters marched onto East Beijing Road, 
smashing windows, robbing more than 20 restaurants, hotels and shops and 
setting fire to commodities and furniture." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters attacked offices of the city's Chengguan District and the 
Communist Party, smashed traffic lights and damaged more than 20 police 
vehicles, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
A Canadian tourist, Roch Berphiaume, told the Associated Press that he saw 
Tibetans ransacking Chinese-owned stores and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of firing," Berphiaume said. Security forces were "running 
with machine guns and rifles," and at one point a stray bullet came through his 
third-floor hotel window, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Forty Officers Hurt 
</P>
<P>
Forty police officers were injured, with 11 of them requiring hospitalization, 
the agency reported. Although the agency said some of the rioters had fired at 
police, Berphiaume and several other Western witnesses who spoke with reporters 
in Beijing said they did not see any protesters with weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In the chaos of the police shooting and rioting, 10 civilians were killed and 
more than 60 were injured, including both rioters and onlookers, the news 
agency report said. Medical workers who rushed to the scene were also attacked, 
it said. 
</P>
<P>
China has firmly controlled the region since 1951 and now looks upon the 
advocacy of independence there as treason. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-independence sentiment among Tibetans remains widespread, however. Sunday's 
protest was the fourth in a series of major demonstrations that have ended with 
police gunfire and fatalities since the first such incident on Oct. 1, 1987. On 
that occasion, from six to 14 people were killed, according to the best 
available information. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8 Killed a Year Ago 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's protest came exactly one year after a similar incident there left at 
least eight people dead. In another protest on Dec. 10, police shot and killed 
a monk who was carrying the outlawed flag of Tibetan independence, according to 
witnesses who later spoke with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
This month also marks the 30th anniversary of an abortive anti-Chinese uprising 
that resulted in the flight to India of the Dalai Lama, Tibet's traditional 
religious and political leader. Authorities in Lhasa had expressed the fear 
that the anniversary would bring further outbursts of anti-Chinese sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors circulated in Lhasa during January that a small quantity of weapons had 
been stolen from Chinese security forces and that authorities feared they might 
be used in pro-independence protests. It was not immediately clear whether this 
in fact is what happened Sunday, or whether such rumors may have been 
intentionally spread by Lhasa authorities to help justify the possible use of 
force to put down demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Shooting of Monk 
</P>
<P>
Western witnesses said that the flag-carrying monk killed on Dec. 10 was shot 
by police before any rioting began. 
</P>
<P>
All the pro-independence demonstrations over the past 18 months have been 
spearheaded by Buddhist monks but have received support from ordinary Tibetans. 
</P>
<P>
The New China News Agency report on Sunday's incident did not say whether there 
was any police action against the original 13 demonstrators that might have 
provoked the subsequent rioting. 
</P>
<P>
The report said that before Sunday's incident, local authorities had attempted 
to dissuade potential protesters "from making trouble" and to "educate them so 
as to maintain social order."

Consumer and health organizations joined insurance groups Sunday in announcing 
a plan to lobby industry and government at all levels in six product-related 
areas that affect public health and safety. 
</P>
<P>
The new, 26-member Coalition for Consumer Health and Safety said the effort 
aims to reduce product-related illnesses and accidents. The coalition estimated 
the annual toll from misuse of what it called risky products -- notably motor 
vehicles, liquor and cigarettes -- at more than 475,000 deaths and $250 billion 
in medical and damage claims. 
</P>
<P>
"The stakes are enormous. Hundreds of thousands of lives are lost, millions of 
injuries and illnesses are suffered and hundreds of billions of dollars in 
medical and related costs are spent each year as a result of products that pose 
an unreasonable risk to consumers," said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of 
the Consumer Federation of America and chairman of the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Formal Alliance 
</P>
<P>
The group said its lobbying effort marked the first time consumer organizations 
and major insurance industry groups have combined formally to work for product 
improvements. It said the campaign will focus on six goals: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To curb casualties from motor vehicle accidents, which killed nearly 46,000 
Americans in 1987, the coalition seeks to promote the use of seat belts and air 
bags, as well as work for more laws requiring their use. It also supports 
extension of safety standards to light trucks, vans and utility vehicles and 
favors toughening drunk-driving laws. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To reduce the number of accidents in the home, which it said annually cause 
28,000 deaths and $10 billion in hospital charges, the coalition supports 
revitalization of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a target of budget 
cuts during the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To discourage tobacco smoking, which it said is responsible for 390,000 
deaths annually, the coalition proposes increasing funds for local, state and 
federal anti-smoking campaigns and tightening the rules on smoking in public, 
especially in public conveyances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alcohol Abuse Toll 
</P>
<P>
 -- To discourage misuse of alcohol, which it said is involved in more than 
100,000 deaths a year, the group recommended restricting alcohol advertising 
directed at youthful drivers and setting tougher penalties for driving under 
the influence. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To guard food quality, the group proposed mandatory inspections of seafood 
for bacterial contamination, as well as long-term controls for pesticide 
residues on fruits and vegetables. It said that Food and Drug Administration 
guidelines should require clear statements of ingredients and nutritional 
values on food labels. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To attack pollution of indoor air, especially contamination with 
cancer-causing radon gas, the coalition advocated expanding federal research 
and making grants to aid state programs. 
</P>
<P>
Although acquired immune deficiency syndrome is not a product-related ailment, 
the coalition said that the public health threat of AIDS, which had killed 
46,344 Americans as of Jan. 3, is too serious to be ignored. It urged that 
private and public sector leaders commit themselves to educating the public 
about the disease, and that employers adopt humane policies toward people with 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition includes 13 consumer and health organizations, among them the 
American Public Health Assn., the American Lung Assn., American Assn. of 
Retired Persons, Center for Science in the Public Interest and the Consumer 
Federation of America. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 13 insurance groups and companies backing the agenda are the American 
Council of Life Insurance, the American Insurance Assn., Allstate Insurance 
Co., the Kemper Group, Liberty Mutual Insurance Group, Nationwide Insurance 
Co., the Prudential Insurance Co. of America and State Farm Insurance Co.

W. GERMAN 'HACKERS' TRICKED KGB, PAPER SAYS

West German computer "hackers" repeatedly tricked the Soviet KGB into paying up 
to $164,000 for easily accessible and insignificant Western data bank 
information, a newspaper said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"The hacker spies apparently exploited the ignorance of the Russians," the Welt 
am Sonntag newspaper said. "The hackers laughed their heads off" after being 
paid by the KGB, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper was quoting from notes by federal officials investigating the 
affair, in which eight hackers are suspected of infiltrating Western military, 
industrial and research computer systems on behalf of the KGB starting in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The home-computer hackers are suspected of electronically tapping into, among 
other systems, a U.S. Defense Department data bank, the Italian-French arms 
maker Thomson SA and the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in West 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sensational' Data 
</P>
<P>
The KGB believed the hackers' success in penetrating the periphery of the 
Pentagon data bank was "sensational." They apparently did not know this was a 
relatively simple task for an amateur computer buff, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Welt am Sonntag said the KGB repeatedly paid the hackers large sums of money 
for "largely open information" because the "Pentagon was a magic word" for 
Soviet officials. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the federal prosecutor's office and the Interior Ministry 
declined comment on the article. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the investigation to date showed that the hackers were 
generally unable to breach computer core systems where sensitive military or 
industrial secrets are stored. 
</P>
<P>
West German government officials have termed the espionage case serious but 
warned against jumping to conclusions on its impact on Western security until 
inquiries are completed. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Defense Department says it has not yet determined what 
effect the spying has had on U.S. security.

MISSING SOUTHLAND SOLDIER RETURNS TO HIS BASE IN GERMANY

Michael Peri, an Army intelligence specialist from Orange County who 
authorities feared had defected to East Germany has turned himself into 
military police in West Germany, unharmed and carrying a portable computer he 
had apparently taken with him. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. military officials were interrogating Peri on Sunday and declined to 
reveal where the soldier had been for 11 days or why he left the base without 
permission. He has not yet been charged in the incident, Army spokesman Lt. 
Col. Jake Dye said by telephone from West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Peri, 21, a specialist fourth class whose parents live in Laguna Niguel, 
disappeared from his 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment office in Fulda, West 
Germany, Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Peri's jeep was found two days later about a mile from the East German border, 
prompting military officials to speculate that he may have defected and taken 
sensitive Army information possibly stored inside a personal computer that was 
reported missing at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
But at 5 p.m. Saturday, 11 days after he left the base, Peri turned himself in. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computer Underneath Arm 
</P>
<P>
"He was dressed in civilian clothes and had the computer underneath his arm," 
said Dye. "He just walked up to the gate, identified himself and surrendered." 
</P>
<P>
Peri, who has been nominated twice for best soldier in his unit, has been 
permitted to talk with the base chaplain and legal advisers, but not family 
members, Dye said. He is being held in a detention center inside the Fulda 
base. 
</P>
<P>
"He is being questioned by military police and Army intelligence officers right 
now. He is aware that his actions have created quite a stir," Dye said. "It may 
well be through tomorrow before we announce what he's being charged with and 
even that might be premature. It all depends on Peri's cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
Dye said that the Army has no evidence that the young soldier actually did 
cross the border into East Germany. Peri's jeep, while found a short distance 
from the border, was also less than a mile from the village of Obersuhl. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, we don't know if he stayed there or not. It's a small village, but you 
can get accommodations for food and lodging," Dye said, adding that Peri's jeep 
was in working condition when it was found. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Information Not Disclosed 
</P>
<P>
Military officials have declined to say what information, if any, Peri was 
carrying in the portable computer. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Pentagon had launched an investigation with the help of West 
German authorities to determine exactly what Peri was working on at the time of 
his disappearance, according to spokeswoman Maj. Kathy Wood. 
</P>
<P>
Wood could not be reached for further comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dye, Peri had "access to classified information, but we do not 
know exactly what he was working on when he disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
Family members in Orange County said Sunday that they had not spoken with Peri 
since his return to the base and were not told why he had been missing for 11 
days, but they were relieved that he was back, unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
"The Army wouldn't tell us where he was. I couldn't tell you either. He's the 
only one that could tell you what happened and they won't let us speak to him," 
Ken Peri, Michael's brother said. "It was a real relief to know that he was 
safe. It was a pretty wild week for our family." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speculation Rejected 
</P>
<P>
Ken Peri said that he would not allow himself to believe Army officials' 
speculation that his younger brother attempted to defect to East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good kid. He wouldn't do anything like that. It just doesn't make 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
Peri's aunt, Jackie Andre, said she was concerned that the Army would not tell 
them where Peri was during his 11-day absence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just as curious as everyone else," Andre said. "The main thing is that our 
prayers were answered. He's safe, healthy and back on the base." 
</P>
<P>
Peri's parents, Fred and Winnie, were unavailable for comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lived Abroad 
</P>
<P>
Peri, a 1985 graduate from La Quinta High School in Westminster, lived abroad 
as a teen-ager, attending schools in Austria and South Africa. Late last year, 
the family took up residence in a $400,000 hilltop home in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives said that the tall, blond-haired soldier had expressed an interest in 
continuing work in the intelligence field after leaving the Army. In 1983, Peri 
completed an 18-week intelligence course at Ft. Devens, Mass. In March, 1988, 
Peri asked the Army to station him in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Peri had planned to return to college after leaving the service to get a degree 
that would then enable him to apply for a job with the CIA, according to Bob 
Andre, Peri's uncle.

A group has threatened to blow up a monument to Dante Alighieri because the 
medieval poet's famed "Divine Comedy" places the Prophet Mohammed in hell, 
officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Mauro Dragone said he ordered increased security around the monument to 
the poet, who died in Ravenna in 1321, after receiving a threatening letter 
from a group calling itself "Guardians of the Revolution." 
</P>
<P>
The "Divine Comedy" is considered a literary masterpiece that established the 
Tuscan dialect as the literary language of Italy. The work, a poem of more than 
14,000 lines in 100 cantos, recounts a poet's journey through hell, purgatory 
and heaven. It places Mohammed in the ninth pit of hell.

UGANDA'S ELEPHANT HERDS ENDANGERED, CONSERVATIONIST SAYS

Elephant herds, cut to a fraction of their former size by poachers and 
trigger-happy Ugandan soldiers, will be wiped out soon if current losses 
continue, according to a Ugandan conservation expert. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Edroma, director of the Uganda Institute of Ecology, said Saturday that 
only 1,500 to 2,000 remain of the 20,000 elephants that roamed Uganda in the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the losses occurred in the 1970s when dictator Idi Amin's soldiers 
killed the animals indiscriminately. Losses of elephants and other animals 
continued on a large scale in some areas after Amin was overthrown in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Edroma said rebels are killing an estimated 10 to 15 elephants a month in the 
Murchison Falls National Park in northern Uganda. The authorities believe ivory 
from the tusks is being smuggled out through Zaire and Sudan, with the proceeds 
used by rebel groups to buy arms and ammunition.

RADICAL PALESTINIAN SAYS HE'LL KILL RUSHDIE

<P>
Radical Palestinian guerrilla leader Ahmed Jibril vowed Sunday to kill British 
author Salman Rushdie in compliance with the orders of Iran's leader, the 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
Jibril, an ex-Syrian army officer and head of the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC), said in a statement: 
</P>
<P>
"We in the PFLP-GC will confront this new conspiracy (against Islam) and work 
to execute the legal action against Rushdie." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Damascus-based PFLP-GC, asked if the statement represented 
a death threat against the Indian-born author, said: "Certainly. This is a 
death sentence against Rushdie." 
</P>
<P>
The statement, quoting verses from the Koran, said Rushdie's novel, "The 
Satanic Verses," was a conspiracy to defame Islam and had been written at the 
behest of "arrogant (Western)" forces. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian clerics, saying the book blasphemes Islam, have offered a $5.2-million 
reward for Rushdie's death. 
</P>
<P>
"The satanic media all over the world rallied their resources to promote 
Rushdie's book," Jibril's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The PFLP-GC is part of a Syrian-based radical Palestinian alliance that also 
has ties to Libya. It opposes the policies of Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations against the book have killed at least 20 people in Pakistan and 
India.

TOWER UNWILLING TO CONCEDE DEFEAT; 
</P>
<P>
SOME SENATORS MAY CHANGE MINDS, DEFENSE NOMINEE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Tower said Sunday that the rancorous Senate debate over his nomination to 
be secretary of defense is not helping his chances, but he refused to concede 
defeat, suggesting that some senators opposed to his confirmation may change 
their minds. 
</P>
<P>
Tower added during a nationally televised interview that he had become a 
"relatively secondary" figure in a historic struggle between President Bush and 
the Democratic-controlled Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Tower, a former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and four-term 
senator, again refused during his appearance on CBS' "Face the Nation" to 
consider backing out before a vote on his nomination is held, probably before 
the end of this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be damaging to the President if he withdrew my name or if I 
withdrew," Tower said, "because it would mean that the President had finally 
been pressured into pulling down a nominee that he believes to be eminently 
qualified. . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
John Tower 'Not Issue' 
</P>
<P>
"And I think in the process what will become clear here is that . . . John 
Tower is not really the issue -- John Tower was simply the instrument by which 
the President was defeated on a major decision," Tower added. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats opposed to Tower, led by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam 
Nunn, have charged that his excessive drinking and high-paid work for defense 
contractors shortly after he was a U.S. arms negotiator at Geneva have 
disqualified him to run the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
His Republican defenders, however, contend that the allegations are not 
corroborated and accuse the Democrats of setting new ethical standards as an 
excuse to reject the President's highly qualified nominee. 
</P>
<P>
Senate debate is scheduled to resume today and Republican champions of Tower 
said it could go on for a long time, but most senators expect a roll call on 
the nomination by Wednesday or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush spent the weekend at Camp David, Md., while his chief of staff, John H. 
Sununu, went to New Hampshire for a skiing weekend with Vice President Dan 
Quayle, leaving Tower to carry a heavy burden in the prolonged confirmation 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Face to Face Session 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said on another 
television program, ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley," that he would ask 
the Senate early this week for permission to have Tower come to the Senate 
chamber to face his friends, foes and undecided lawmakers before a vote is 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like these five, six, seven or eight undecided Democrats and Republicans 
to have a chance to ask questions," Dole said. "Maybe they'll change their 
minds." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.), appearing with Dole, said that Tower had "an 
outside chance" to win confirmation, and Sen. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.), who 
remains uncommitted, said the outcome may be decided by a single vote. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), a conservative Democrat wooed by President 
Bush who later came out against Tower, urged Tower to withdraw his name because 
"I don't think he's going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
DeConcini said that when he talked to Bush, he called his attention to several 
items in the FBI reports that the President had not read. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush Denies Knowledge 
</P>
<P>
"He (Bush) wrote them down. He said: 'I didn't know they were in there.' And to 
me, that's significant, that the Administration wasn't totally briefed on the 
whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Other senators began talking about possible alternatives to Tower. Heflin, 
appearing on the CNN program "Newsmaker Sunday," endorsed former Republican 
Rep. Jack Edwards of Alabama for the post if Tower is defeated. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an Alabamian that we think a great deal of," Heflin said of Edwards. 
"He was an outstanding member of Congress, very knowledgeable on defense 
matters." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Richard C. Shelby (D-Ala.), who is opposed to Tower, agreed about Edwards 
but said there were many others who could handle the job. 
</P>
<P>
"The nomination of Sen. Tower is crippled," he said on the CNN program. "I 
don't believe he's going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leaning Against Nomination 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, a spokesman for Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) said he was "leaning very 
heavily against" the nomination as time neared for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sens. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), Christopher 
J. Dodd (D-Conn.), Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), Charles S. Robb (D-Va.) and 
Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) were key lawmakers who have not announced how they 
intend to vote. 
</P>
<P>
If the Republicans can hold all of their 45 senators, they need at least five 
Democrats to vote for Tower. This would create a 50-50 tie and Quayle would 
cast a tie-breaking vote in favor of confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
Tower, however, pinned his hopes for victory on making converts out of senators 
who already have announced their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
When an interviewer said that "everybody knows you can't win," Tower replied: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't concede that for one moment. . . . Senators are quite capable of 
changing their minds. I've seen them do it many times. . . . And I think 
there's an imminent possibility that some minds will be changed as this 
situation plays out, and as the arguments against me appear to be more thin." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Makes Distinction 
</P>
<P>
On the central issue concerning his use of alcohol, Tower distinguished between 
"excessive drinking," which he said was a problem for him in the 1970s, and 
"alcohol abuse," which he denied. 
</P>
<P>
While he has pledged to stop drinking any alcoholic beverage if he is 
confirmed, Tower added, he still has "a sip of wine every now and then." 
</P>
<P>
When asked why he did not stop drinking now as a sign of good faith, Tower 
responded: "Why should I? . . . It's so little that it doesn't really matter. 
And one reason that I can give it up, and give it up easily, is because it 
doesn't really matter that much."

MAN CRITICALLY BURNED AFTER METALLIC BALLOONS CAUSE POWER LINE TO EXPLODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Floating metallic balloons hit a power line in South Los Angeles, causing the 
line to short circuit and fall on an area resident, who was critically injured, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Olivio, 47, suffered third-degree burns after the 4,800-volt line was 
brushed by at least one of the helium-filled balloons and fell about 3:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Like a shotgun blast, the line exploded, then shattered and fell on the 
resident and wrapped around his legs," Los Angeles Police Sgt. Ted Spicer said. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor, Jose Randy, saw Olivio and "in great jeopardy to himself" used a 
wooden broom to untangle the man from the live wire, Spicer said. "If it wasn't 
for Mr. Randy's quick thinking and actions, the man would have definitely been 
dead on the spot." 
</P>
<P>
Spicer said the balloons possibly drifted into the 2200 block of Ellendale 
Avenue from nearby festivities for the Los Angeles Marathon. He said 
helium-filled metallic balloons have been outlawed in other cities because they 
pose a safety hazard, but have not been banned in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Olivio was reported in critical condition at County-USC Medical Center late 
Sunday.

Under a new ordinance, smoking is banned in most public places, including 
buses, restaurants, government offices, hospitals and theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Violators who smoke in public places that are not designated smoking zones face 
$10 fines, 10-day jail sentences, or both. Quezon City has a population of more

case, died Friday after a long illness following a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
In 1951, Scott, his brother, the late John J. Scott, and the late Charles 
Bledsoe sued the Topeka Board of Education in U.S. District Court on behalf of 
Linda Brown, a black elementary school student. 
</P>
<P>
The case was later appealed to the Supreme Court, which declared on May 17, 
1954, that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.

Helton's polemic against the INS typifies blatant bias parading as reason. He 
would substitute for the "low-level functionaries" of the INS (an agency guilty 
of having a "law enforcement mentality) some low-level functionaries of the 
Justice Department. Is it because he thinks the difference lies in the fact 
that the Justice Department does not have a "law enforcement mentality"? Or is 
it perhaps the fact that the low-level functionaries of the Justice Department 
might be more inclined toward his political biases than are those of the INS?

THINKING BIG AT TAHOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Environmental battles rarely are won as most people think of winning -- as the 
successful conclusion of a struggle. Thus, the battle to "save" Lake Tahoe 
continues, even though impressive progress has been made in the past two years 
to manage growth in a way that will do the least damage to the environment of 
the once-pristine Sierra Nevada lake. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the California-Nevada Tahoe Regional Planning Agency adopted a 
sensible new plan for development in the lake basin, but only after years of 
litigation by the California attorney general's office and the League to Save 
Lake Tahoe. Late last year, another impressive step was taken with the approval 
of a 1,500-page plan for correcting environmental problems in the popular 
year-round resort area. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called 208 plan, drafted to meet the demands of Section 208 of the 
federal Clean Water Act, calls for a $300-million program to control erosion 
and to restore damaged wetlands. Significantly, the plan prohibits further 
development in stream environment zones. A major source of pollution in the 
lake, causing degradation of its famed clarity, has been runoff from erosion in 
the flood plains. 
</P>
<P>
But problems at the lake, particularly in the South Shore area of South Lake 
Tahoe, Calif., and Stateline, Nev., would get even worse if the regional 
planning agency yields to the desire of the giant Nevada casinos at Stateline 
to build a sports palace and additional garages holding 10,000 parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Other than pollution of the lake itself, the major problems at Tahoe are 
traffic congestion and air quality, particularly in the South Shore urban 
complex. The sports center and parking proposals are contained in a draft of 
the proposed Douglas County (Nev.) 20-year growth plan. But the bi-state 
regional plan requires that local-growth measures balance commercial 
development with environmental-mitigation measures, and particularly transit 
facilities and other actions that will diminish congestion and air pollution. 
The Douglas County plan has no such mitigation program. 
</P>
<P>
That is not the way to save Lake Tahoe.

'BAD SCENE IN SOUTH TEXAS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Bad scene in South Texas" has the INS and the refugees from Nicaragua between 
a "rock and a hard place." Members of Congress, above all, must be held 
responsible for their procrastination and ineptitude in developing a logical 
immigration policy. Their lack of prescience in the "on again, off again" 
penurious funding of the Contras would have made a difference in the lives of 
their citizens had they funded the Contras properly. 
</P>
<P>
Not unlike a plague, the Nicaraguans, now considered refugees, are joined by 
the people of El Salvador and Guatemala inundating our ports of entry on our 
southern border. 
</P>
<P>
Until the political, socioeconomic conditions improve they shall continue to 
deluge our borders.

THE ILLUSION OF SHAMIR'S 'PEACE' PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL MUST REJECT NONSENSE AND BEGIN TO DEAL WITH ARAFAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By URI AVNERY, Israeli journalist Uri Avery writes for the Hebrew-language 
magazine Haolam Hazeh (This World). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TEL AVIV 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new Israeli "peace ideas," revealed last month by Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir, bring to mind the stage routine in which the illusion of walking and 
even sprinting is created without the pantomimist advancing a single inch. 
Shamir's intention was to generate feverish diplomatic activity, giving the 
illusion of movement without actually advancing even an inch closer to peace. 
</P>
<P>
Key elements in Shamir's sham "ideas" for settling the Palestinian conflict 
are: autonomy Camp David style, election of a new Palestinian leadership 
without ties to the Palestine Liberation Organization and negotiations about 
the occupied territories with Jordan and other Arab governments. 
</P>
<P>
None of these elements make sense. 
</P>
<P>
It is not for mere autonomy, a caricature of independence, that Palestinian 
boys and girls are sacrificing their lives. The Palestinians, who were a beaten 
and humiliated people, ignored by the world and by their fellow Arabs, have 
been transformed by 15 months of struggle. Having stood up to an aggressive and 
efficient army, the Palestinian people have a new sense of pride and national 
resolve. They know their uprising cannot be quelled. It is ridiculous to think 
that they will halt their growing rebellion in return for the privilege of 
administering their own sewage system. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of establishing an alternative Palestinian leadership is equally 
ridiculous. The most important achievement of the intifada has been the 
strengthening of the PLO and the enhancement of its prestige and authority. 
From a secondary and neglected pre-intifada status, Yasser Arafat and the PLO 
have moved to center stage in the Arab world. Arab leaders look to Arafat to 
mediate disputes and world leaders are vying for an official visit with him. 
</P>
<P>
For any emerging state, universally recognized leadership is of the utmost 
importance. The Palestinians understand this and, with few exceptions, rally 
behind the PLO. The exceptions, marginal splinter groups and foreign agents, 
are not tolerated any more than similar splinter groups were tolerated in other 
emerging countries, including the pre-state Jewish settlement in Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government insists that it will never negotiate with the PLO 
because it has conducted terrorist activities. This stand is not credible as 
long as Israel sits in the United Nations along with 50 other countries whose 
leaders, like Shamir, were terrorists until their independence was achieved. 
This stand does not make sense when it is remembered that Israel signed an 
agreement with West Germany only six years after the end of the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
In favor of negotiating with Jordan's King Hussein rather than with Arafat, the 
tired argument is made that there are more Palestinian Arabs in Jordan than in 
the occupied territories. But there also are more Jews in the United States 
than in Greater Israel. Should then the Arabs negotiate with George Bush rather 
than with the government of Israel? 
</P>
<P>
If we abandon Shamir's insincere nonsense, what remains is for Israel to 
negotiate with the PLO. After 100 years of enmity between the two peoples, the 
recognized leader of the Palestinian people has stood up and declared his 
willingness to negotiate with Israel to achieve a peace in which our country 
and a Palestinian state will stand side-by-side. The only rational response is 
immediately to stop the bloodshed, for which there is no longer any excuse, and 
to enter negotiations now. 
</P>
<P>
Those who doubt Arafat's sincerity can rest assured that negotiations are not 
about words; rather, they are about issues of substance: the border between 
Israel and Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, defense arrangements, the 
refugee problem and relations between the two countries. If Arafat is not 
sincere, that will be discovered very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Those in Israel who refuse to negotiate with Arafat are saying in essence that 
they prefer not to have peace. Shamir's sham is a game played to gain time. But 
as the intifada grows, augmenting the moral and political strength of the 
Palestinian people, and as our strength and international prestige decline, we 
are not gaining time, we are losing it. 
</P>
<P>
It is in Israel's vital interest at this time to come to the negotiating table 
with Yasser Arafat, the only man whose signature can hold the Palestinian 
people to a peace agreement. The price that we Israelis will pay for peace is a 
dear one: all of the territory captured in 1967. But there is no other rational 
choice. Those Israelis who propose to free Arafat from his commitment to peace 
are risking Israel's very existence.

TOWER AFFAIR SIGNALS ALCOHOL'S RETREAT, BUT WILL IT SOUND A CALL FOR 
PROHIBITION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID F. MUSTO, David F. Musto, MD, is a professor of psychiatry and the 
history of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Tower's offer to abstain from alcohol if confirmed as secretary of defense 
and the serious debate his offer has evoked constitutes one more milestone in 
America's changing attitude toward alcohol. Consumption of alcohol, especially 
distilled spirits, has been declining in the United States since 1980. Last 
year, per-capita consumption of wine declined, even in California, a dramatic 
break in a long, sustained rise. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1980s the drunk-driving issue has increasingly alarmed 
Americans. Through the efforts of Mothers Against Drunk Drivers and Remove 
Intoxicated Drivers, penalties for driving under the influence have grown more 
severe. In 1984 a scattering of states were holding out against a national 
trend to raise the drinking age to 21; the federal government brought them into 
line by threatening to withhold a portion of federal highway funds. A section 
of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 requires that beginning next November, all 
alcoholic beverages sold in the United States carry a label warning of birth 
defects, impairment in operating machinery, including an automobile, and other 
health problems from drinking the bottle's contents. 
</P>
<P>
These changes in our national approach toward alcohol reflect the most 
significant shift against alcohol since Prohibition's repeal in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
Two themes can be discerned: a shift from seeing alcohol as a cheerful beverage 
that has a safe consumption limit to perceiving alcohol as a toxin or poison 
that has no minimum safe limit -- the more you drink, the more toxin you 
consume. The second theme is a gradual amalgamation of alcohol into the ranks 
of other drugs that have aroused American fear and desire to control opiates, 
cocaine, tobacco and so on. Another example of these drugs being gathered into 
one corral was the statement of the surgeon general last fall that nicotine 
could be compared to cocaine in its power to addict. 
</P>
<P>
Tobacco's changing image prompted a parallel to Tower's abstinence pledge from 
the "drug czar" William J. Bennett. Bennett swore to stop his cigarette habit 
before undertaking his duties to coordinate our anti-drug program. It will be 
interesting to see whether he will be asked or moved to make a similar 
statement with regard to alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Where is this heading? First, I suggest that alcohol will be the kind of target 
in the 1990s that tobacco has been in the 1980s. In America the trend against 
alcohol marked by such significant legal and emotional shifts has more than 
once progressed to the point where the legal restrictions become more 
controversial than alcohol. The most likely cause for conflict is not warning 
labels or lists of ingredients but implementation of a popular theory linking 
price with alcohol consumption. The art in adding to alcohol taxes is to 
balance the increase with the danger of stimulating bootlegging. The ideal 
result would be to increase revenue and reduce consumption, but the political 
hazard is substantial. 
</P>
<P>
For politicians a strong turn against alcohol may set up a series of 
experiences similar to the impact of Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg's past marijuana 
use. Public opinion has no awareness of historical context; current opinion is 
an eternal truth. Adjustment to a new public standard must be made by those in 
front of the public, not by the public. Pledges, conversions and evasions in 
this area can be expected to rise. 
</P>
<P>
Overall we are experiencing a trend against chemical aids to energy, happiness 
and insight. Americans, at least the middle class, are searching for health 
through pesticide-free foods, pure water, clean air and exercise. Cholesterol 
is a dirty word. 
</P>
<P>
The willingness to face the negative side of alcohol is refreshing after half a 
century of denial during the backlash to Prohibition. The problem posed by our 
past temperance movements is that once the toxic image of alcohol has gained 
dominance, we have felt morally obligated to extinguish alcohol's availability. 
As we move further into this attitude, new for our generation, the task will be 
to maintain a frank awareness of alcohol's liabilities while escaping the 
political dead end of alcohol prohibition.

WOODLAND HILLS CONDO PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
BUILDER OFFERS EVERGREEN WALL TO SHIELD NEIGHBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Woodland Hills developer turned a thicket of pine boughs into a symbolic 
olive branch Sunday to apparently end a rift with nearby homeowners over 
construction of a new hilltop condominium project. 
</P>
<P>
Development partner James R. Gary pledged that 50 large evergreens will be 
planted alongside 30 existing sycamores to screen the 24-unit luxury townhouse 
project from the view of a 30-year-old neighborhood at the bottom of the hill. 
</P>
<P>
The developers will agree to a written guarantee that the heavy landscaping 
will be permanently maintained, and that the trees will never be removed to 
give condominium residents a better view, Gary promised the leader of a 
neighborhood protest against the project. 
</P>
<P>
The assurances to Paula Corby came three hours after 75 of Corby's neighbors 
gathered in her front yard to map plans to fight the construction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Late 
</P>
<P>
To their dismay, the homeowners were told that their complaints were 12 years 
too late to halt the three-story project, which was approved by Los Angeles 
city officials in mid-1978. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have any hopes of having it redesigned or cut to one story in height, 
I'd say you're blowing into the wind," said Benjamin Reznik, an Encino land-use 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
He said the entire 80-unit West Hills Condominiums project at 20700 Ventura 
Blvd. was approved for construction in three phases. The 24-unit hilltop 
building now being erected over Corby's neighborhood is the final phase. 
</P>
<P>
In granting the 1978 approval, city officials ordered that enough trees and 
shrubs be planted around the project so that it would "not be any more 
obtrusive than would a single-family dwelling." 
</P>
<P>
"Technically, they don't have to put the landscaping in until they're done and 
ready for occupancy," Reznik told glum-faced residents, who live south of the 
hill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Future Buyers 
</P>
<P>
He warned that future buyers of the $350,000 condominiums might decide to cut 
down some of the trees after the city signs off on the project so as "to keep 
their magnificent views." 
</P>
<P>
Angry downhill residents said they felt betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to public hearings and fought this 12 years ago and thought we had 
something we could live with," said Robert McKnight, a 23-year resident. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor Bert Harrigan said he assumed that the condominiums would be built so 
they would not be visible from his De La Guerra Street home of 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Three hours after the front yard protest ended, Gary escorted Corby to the 
hilltop project site. Gary is a real estate broker who became a limited partner 
in the condominium project last year when his firm sold the financially 
troubled property to San Francisco builder Ed Dade. 
</P>
<P>
He showed Corby landscape plans and artist's sketches that depicted the 
building nearly hidden behind rows of lush, green trees. 
</P>
<P>
Gary said that the developers will not object if the city wants to amend the 
1978 development agreement to specify that the new trees can never be cut down 
and must always be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Facing North 
</P>
<P>
He said that future condominium buyers are not likely to want to remove the 
trees anyway since their dwelling units will face north. He led Corby into 
several of the unfinished units to prove that the best views face away from her 
neighborhood and toward Warner Center to the north. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a forest up here," Gary said, showing Corby the first group 
of 25 boxed evergreens that were delivered to the site six days ago. The 
30-foot-tall pines and redwoods cost about $2,400 each. 
</P>
<P>
Corby said she was relieved by the condominiums' north-facing design and by the 
landscape plan. 
</P>
<P>
"If it ends up being as thick as that, my personal opinion is it will be all 
right," she told Gary, explaining that her neighborhood is not against a 
quality development on the hilltop. 
</P>
<P>
But Corby said her neighbors will demand that the lifetime tree guarantee "be 
put in cement" by the city because of past city confusion over the condominium 
project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fully Occupied' 
</P>
<P>
As recently as May, 1988, Corby said, city officials were under the impression 
that the entire $7.5-million project was completed, fully occupied and heavily 
landscaped. 
</P>
<P>
"All 80 units have been constructed," wrote K.A. Ayers, manager of the Van Nuys 
office of the city's Building and Safety Department on May 31. He said in a 
letter to Woodland Hills-area City Councilman Marvin Braude that the occupancy 
permit for the final 24-unit phase was issued Feb. 10, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"A special investigation by my staff this week confirmed that all required 
decorative walls, screening and heavy landscaping . . . have been installed," 
Ayers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
But Corby said construction of the final phase did not even begin until several 
months after that.

VALLEY TRANSIT ROUTES; 
</P>
<P>
ANOTHER 'FINAL' RAIL SHOWDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In five years of study and debate over a San Fernando Valley rail line, there 
have been several showdown meetings to determine the routes, once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
But each time a decision was made, the issue was later scrambled through the 
lobbying of one of the contending parties in this long-running controversy. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission has scheduled 
still another such "final" meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Ostensibly, commissioners are meeting to consider mid-course corrections to an 
engineering and environmental study of cross-Valley route options. 
</P>
<P>
But the commission staff has warned that the proposed changes could delay the 
study so long that the Valley could lose its place in line for a rail system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competing Projects 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairwoman Christine E. Reed said that since a consensus on a rail 
route for the Valley might be impossible to achieve at this time, the 
commission should consider committing its available funds to two competing 
projects -- a downtown-to-Pasadena light-rail line and a northern extension of 
the Century Freeway light-rail line already under construction. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be necessary for the Valley to wait until after the turn of the century 
to get a rail line," said Reed, who also is a Santa Monica councilwoman. 
</P>
<P>
Some local elected officials, noting the Valley's political clout in Sacramento 
and among Los Angeles City Council members, have scoffed at warnings that the 
Valley might be dropped from consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the warnings have touched off a storm of organizing activity by 
rail proponents -- mostly business groups, civic organizations and a few 
homeowner leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to pressure the commissioners into keeping the study process on track, 
chambers of commerce and other groups are providing bus transportation to the 
1:30 p.m. session in the Board of Supervisors hearing room. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homeowner Leaders 
</P>
<P>
The show of force by proponents is being countered by homeowner leaders, who in 
recent years have formed three formidable coalitions to fight the proposed 
intrusion of rail into residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say that they would favor a line that completely avoids single-family 
areas, and they have turned out as many as 700 people at past hearings in the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Since this session is downtown, "far fewer are expected," said Encino homeowner 
leader Gerald A. Silver, a founder of the Coalition of Freeway Residents, which 
is fighting a proposed Ventura Freeway line. 
</P>
<P>
However, Silver said the coalition, which was formed by six south Valley 
homeowner organizations, has recently expanded its mailing list and has sent 
pamphlets to 4,300 people who live or own property near the Ventura Freeway, 
urging them to protest at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition has been building since September, when the commission voted to 
restart the $2.1-million environmental study it had interrupted one year 
earlier in the face of angry protests from affected homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Routes Being Studied 
</P>
<P>
Routes under consideration in the study are the Ventura Freeway right of way 
from the planned Universal City Metro Rail station to Warner Center in Woodland 
Hills and a Southern Pacific railroad freight right of way that roughly 
parallels Chandler and Victory boulevards between Metro Rail's northern 
terminus on Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood and Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted to study the freeway route as a ground-level or elevated 
Metro Rail extension, and to study the Chandler-Victory route in three 
configurations -- as an all-subway Metro Rail extension, as a Metro Rail 
extension in a deep trench through residential areas and elevated through 
commercial areas or as a light-rail line placed in a shallow trench in 
residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
Making the 15-mile, cross-Valley line a light-rail system, which would have 
about one-third of the capacity of the faster and costlier Metro Rail, would 
require passengers to change trains in North Hollywood to get to Hollywood or 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, transit planners say that light rail might provide all the 
capacity the Valley needs and that it could be built for the $800 million the 
commission expects to have over the next 11 years to build additional rails 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost Estimates 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary cost estimates for other Valley options are $1.3 billion for the 
freeway elevated line and as much as $2 billion for an all-subway line. 
</P>
<P>
When the Valley study, which is required by state environmental law, was 
restarted in September, it was expected to be completed by October and to serve 
as a basis for picking a route and a technology. 
</P>
<P>
But in January the staff recommended changes and the Valley study has since 
been slipping behind. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the changes originated with the office of the Los Angeles City 
Council's chief legislative analyst, which contends that the commission's 
September action misinterpreted the council's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
While the commission, which is composed of the five county supervisors plus 
council members from several cities, has the final say in route selection, its 
practice has been to obtain approval from affected cities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recommended Changes 
</P>
<P>
The recommended changes include adding as an option the construction of a Metro 
Rail extension only as far west as the Sepulveda Basin, with completion to 
Warner Center after funds become available in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a light-rail line in a shallow trench should be dropped from 
consideration because it was not what the council had in mind when it endorsed 
the Chandler-Victory line provided the impact on homeowners was minimized, the 
legislative analyst's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Another recommended change is to study the freeway as a light-rail line. It 
would use the same computer-controlled system -- but without unsightly overhead 
power lines -- that is being employed on the Century Freeway and will be used 
on the Coast line when it is ultimately extended north past Los Angeles 
International Airport to the north Valley. 
</P>
<P>
When the commission's four-member Transit Committee took up the changes last 
month, protesters were there in force. 
</P>
<P>
After the committee voted to recommend that any line along the freeway be 
subway in residential areas and that magnetic-levitation and monorail 
technology also be studied, staff members warned that such changes would 
substantially delay the Valley study. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar Studies 
</P>
<P>
Similar studies of the proposed Pasadena line and the proposed Century Freeway 
line extension north to Marina del Rey will be finished by June. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Stanger, commission rail development director, noting that both 
competing projects have widespread local support and virtually no opposition, 
predicts that commissioners "will come under severe pressure to move ahead on 
one or both of those rather than wait for the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
In past hearings, homeowner opponents have argued that trains, running as 
frequently as every three minutes, would bring intolerable noise, traffic 
congestion and ground vibrations to their neighborhoods. They complain that 
even if a line is a subway, the stations, situated every mile, would bring many 
of the same problems as would above-ground trains. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents argue that no route completely avoids residential neighborhoods, but 
that trenching or placing the line underground will eliminate all or most of 
the noise. 
</P>
<P>
They also have argued that public opinion polls have shown wide support for a 
cross-Valley line, whether it is on the freeway or the Chandler-Victory 
corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) is among those who think the Valley has the 
political leverage in Sacramento to edge out the two competing lines. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the commission regularly needs legislation approved in Sacramento, 
Katz, chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, said commissioners 
"know that my response to any request from them will be conditioned by how they 
treat the Valley rail line."

<P>
HEAT MAKES RACE A BATTLE OF ATTRITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Is it possible that a race may be declared victorious in Sunday's fourth annual 
Los Angeles Marathon? That a course of deceptively undulating hills would 
prevail over the fittest runners? That bright sunshine would conquer even those 
athletes from the warmest regions of the world? 
</P>
<P>
Believe it. As runners began to peel off over the course of the race's 26 miles 
385 yards, it became clear that this marathon would be a race of attrition. It 
is always the way in these matters, but Sunday was a day for chance and 
caprice, for natural elements to triumph over plans of men and women. 
</P>
<P>
Unplanned -- and nearly overlooked -- was Art Boileau's methodical overtaking 
of the fallen leaders. The Canadian, who had won this race in 1987, was running 
comfortably in 10th while chaos was befalling those who chose to set a fast 
pace on a day when the sun beat down unobstructed. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature at the 9 a.m. start was 63 degrees, not bad, but also not 
likely to hold. It did not and it was tough going for the 18,861 entrants. A 
fine sunny day burst out, sending temperatures up to the mid-70s, about 20 
degrees above a marathoner's comfort zone. 
</P>
<P>
Boileau's conservative first half of the race proved to be the day's brilliant 
tactic. His winning time was 2 hours 13 minutes 1 second, well off his personal 
best of 2:11:15 and further still from the course record of 2:10:19. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the women's winner, Zoya Ivanova of the Soviet Union, couldn't gain 
her personal best from her winning time of 2:34:42, but she was thrilled to be 
around to try. She beat world champion Rosa Mota of Portugal, who ran 2:35:27. 
Mota was slowed by a combination of leg pain and pounding heat. 
</P>
<P>
So were they all. 
</P>
<P>
Gidamis Shahanga of Tanzania, who led for most of the race, stopped at 26 
miles, then slowly began to run again as Boileau, who had conserved his energy, 
surged past both second-place Pedro Ortiz of Colombia and Shahanga. 
</P>
<P>
Shahanga had forged a 42-second lead early in the race, setting what other 
runners judged was, and what proved to be, a suicidal pace. Behind him were 
Mark Plaatjes, formerly of South Africa, and Ortiz. They were running as a 
pair. Behind them was a pack strung out and cautious. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of concerned," Boileau said. "The front-runners were going out 
fast, and I was thinking of keeping hydrated." 
</P>
<P>
That concern for getting and keeping fluids was foremost on runners' minds. 
According to medical officials, more than 200 runners were treated after the 
race for dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
Shahanga took water every mile while running easy and strong. He surged at 11 
miles, gaining what was his longest lead. Plaatjes, Ortiz and last year's 
winner, Martin Mondragon, settled in behind. 
</P>
<P>
Where was Boileau, who seemed not a factor until the last mile? 
</P>
<P>
"I was running pretty conservative," Boileau, 31, said. "I was in 10th place 
with (Taisuka) Kodama (of Japan). We were helping each other. I was just 
nailing the guys who would fall behind." 
</P>
<P>
Turned out Boileau nailed everyone as the pace and the heat took its toll. 
Orlando Pizzolato of Italy, one of the race favorites, dropped out at 17 miles, 
a victim of the heat. Patricia Owens, Pizzolato's agent, said he felt dizzy and 
weak. In addition, the Italian federation is requiring Pizzolato to run a 
marathon next month at the World Cup in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
Among the women, the situation was the same. Mota, who says she doesn't usually 
mind heat, nevertheless ran amid a pack of male runners, who provided a wall of 
shade for the 5-foot-1 Portuguese runner. Ivanova went solo; running at first 
behind them, then slightly in front of Mota, but never side by side. 
</P>
<P>
Their race was seemingly decided at the halfway point, because Mota had settled 
for a slow pace. "I was not . . . running well by the half marathon," she said. 
"I didn't feel very good in the legs." 
</P>
<P>
Mota has an on-again, off-again injury involving her sciatic nerve. It was 
on-again Sunday. Mota considered dropping out, too, but she had done that, for 
her first time ever, in her last marathon, and she needed to finish for her 
confidence and as someone well-paid to run here. 
</P>
<P>
"The course is difficult," Mota said. "People don't think so, but there are 
many, many hills." 
</P>
<P>
Ivanova began to put distance between herself and Mota, and Mota didn't 
respond. "I try to catch Zoya," Mota said. "I just can't catch. It was a bad 
day for me." 
</P>
<P>
For others, too. After Pizzolato, the next to drop out was Plaatjes, who was 
third here last year. His luck in this race has been uneven. Last year, running 
for the first time since turning in his South African passport, he was passed 
for second place in the final yards. This year Plaatjes, who has run 2:08:58, 
was primed to win. 
</P>
<P>
Events seemed to favor him. As he pulled into second ahead of Ortiz, far ahead 
Shahanga was laboring. It seemed that Plaatjes, who appeared to be running with 
authority, would soon overtake the struggling Tanzanian. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, at 18 1/2 miles, Plaatjes dropped out. He had no explanation for the 
blood blisters that formed on the balls of his feet. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm not healthy, I can rationalize it," he said. "But I feel like a dog." 
</P>
<P>
Plaatjes was aware of a problem between 11 or 12 miles. "I thought it would go 
away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the next mile, the pain grew worse. Meanwhile, Ortiz pulled away. Plaatjes 
caught the Colombian at 17 miles. The 17th mile was a duel and Plaatjes finally 
surged ahead, running smack into a hill at the 18th mile. There, the pain was 
so great that Plaatjes decided to stop, only the third time he has ever dropped 
out of a race. 
</P>
<P>
Blisters seemed a common problem Sunday -- race officials said 115 people were 
treated for foot ailments, mostly blisters. 
</P>
<P>
Plaatjes veered off the course and stood still, wearing a stunned expression. 
He was not alone in his pain. A television camera crew was there. 
</P>
<P>
"A TV guy said, 'Geez, you're not even breathing hard,' " Plaatjes said. "Of 
course I wasn't tired. I hadn't even started racing yet." 
</P>
<P>
His race was over, but back on the course the racing had hardly begun. Ortiz 
sped ahead to catch the flagging Shahanga. Boileau was coming from behind, 
unseen but all-seeing. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had a little more gas in the tank," he said. "Running from behind you 
can tell if people (Shahanga) are wobbling. Once we saw Shahanga grab his leg, 
I was kind of settling for second place." 
</P>
<P>
Shahanga was overcome by the heat, and after stopping briefly he started again, 
but at a shuffle pace. "The heat just got to me," he said. "I tried very hard. 
I tried to move." 
</P>
<P>
Boileau didn't have to settle for second. He overtook both Ortiz and Shahanga 
in the 26th mile. Ernest Tjela of Lesotho was third in 2:14:30 and Shahanga was 
fourth in 2:15:32. 
</P>
<P>
Boileau and Ivanova each won $26,385 and an automobile. None of the various 
performance bonuses were claimed on a day that produced slow times. 
</P>
<P>
Ivanova was asked if she would be allowed to keep her money and the car, since 
it is common in East Bloc nations that the federation takes a healthy cut of 
prize money. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I will be able to get the car," Ivanova, 37, said through an 
interpreter. "It is a long way from here to the Soviet Union. And even farther 
to my republic, Kasakhstan." 
</P>
<P>
Boileau almost didn't run here, as he hadn't last year. His San Francisco-based 
agent disagreed before last year's race with marathon president Bill Burke as 
to Boileau's worth. There was some wrangling this year, but Burke said he 
wanted Boileau in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Second-place finisher Ortiz said he felt unwanted, too. Despite his 10th-place 
finish here last year, Ortiz was not among the invited runners. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ortiz's manager, Luis Felipe Possa, Ortiz was not considered an 
elite athlete and did not receive either transportation or a hotel room. Possa 
said the Colombian community in Los Angeles pitched in to pay his air fare. He 
said Ortiz slept at the home of a friend. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they can ask me back, now," Ortiz said.

LOYOLA GOES AT PEPPERDINE IN THREES AND WINS, 112-98

<P>
Loyola Marymount ended Pepperdine's season in triplicate Sunday, shooting down 
the Waves, 112-98, in the semifinals of the West Coast Athletic Conference 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions (19-10) used 14 three-pointers to build a 23-point first-half lead, 
then held off a Wave comeback that featured 11 three-pointers of their own to 
advance to tonight's final game against Santa Clara. The game will be televised 
on ESPN at 8:30. 
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal, Santa Clara (20-9) shocked top-seeded St. Mary's 
(25-4), 63-61. The 17th-ranked Gaels beat the fifth-seeded Broncos twice in 
conference play, but Santa Clara kept this game close and won on two free 
throws by Mitch Burley with 12 seconds left. The Gaels' Al Lewis had two shots 
to tie it but failed. 
</P>
<P>
A standing room crowd of 5,465 at USF saw Loyola set a blistering early pace, 
set a tournament scoring record, shoot 53% (including 14 of 27 from three-point 
range) and force 18 Pepperdine turnovers to eliminate their rivals, who were 
seeded second in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Four Loyola starters scored 20 or more points, led by Enoch Simmons' 29 (also 
eight rebounds and six assists) and Bo Kimble's 27, mostly in the first half. 
Hank Gathers finished with 22 points -- his season low -- and 11 rebounds, and 
Jeff Fryer scored 20, all but two from beyond three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine (19-12), which managed to pull to within six points with five 
minutes left, found its inside game limited and depended largely on the outside 
shooting of Shann Ferch, whose 25 points included seven three-pointers, and Tom 
Lewis, who had 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We played a little too much at their pace," Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said. 
"They probably played the first 15 minutes as well as they can play. I'm not 
sure it was our undoing as much as it was their doing. When they shoot like 
that at that kind of pace, they're very tough." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola played one of its best halves of the season, building a 53-30 lead 
behind a barrage of three-pointers. Kimble hit four in the half and the Lions 
hit 10 on the way to a 61-48 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Fryer opened the second half with a three-pointer, and Loyola rebuilt the 
advantage to 70-50 with 18:25 left before Pepperdine offered a serious threat. 
</P>
<P>
Three-pointers by Ferch and Craig Davis got the Waves to within 75-66, and 
Pepperdine stayed within single figures of the Lions until the nine-minute 
mark, when Loyola rebuilt the advantage to 12. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine made one last charge at the Lions when Ferch hit two straight 
three-pointers to get as close as 97-91, but the Waves' point guard, Marty 
Wilson, fouled out and Pepperdine finally wore down, and out. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing them is like playing two games," Asbury said. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Coach Paul Westhead observed that the Lions "ran, shot and defended like 
a team that could have impact in the post-season." 
</P>
<P>
Westhead was one of the first collegiate coaches to embrace the three-pointer 
as a first option. He noted, "We're gonna hit 'em, early or late. It's 
discouraging to opponents to work hard for 20 or 25 seconds for a shot, then 
for us to come down and hit a three-pointer in three seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, who didn't shoot well in Saturday's tournament opener against Gonzaga, 
made 11 of 19 shots Sunday. He said, "Today our guys set great picks, and we 
were able to shoot (more comfortably). When we had it going, we were clicking." 
</P>
<P>
Westhead said he is encouraged that "our guys are looking for the extra pass, 
and that's contagious," and added that Gathers is sacrificing some points to 
kick the ball out to the perimeter. "He's doing everything he can to get us 
into the (NCAA) tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gathers: "I feel like we are the best team (in the WCAC). We have played 
like it the past two nights. We are geared up. We are going to win it, that's 
the way I feel." 
</P>
<P>
Asbury will return to Pepperdine and sit by the phone, hoping for a call from 
the National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not gonna say we're an odds-on bet to get in," Asbury said. "I hope we do. 
We're gonna practice this week."

50-1 SHOT IS RULER OF BIG 'CAP; 
</P>
<P>
MARTIAL LAW TAKES CONTROL, TRIGGERS THREE BIG PAYOFFS 
</P>

<P>
The losers usually cry, but on Sunday it was Barry Irwin, one of the owners of 
Martial Law, who was sobbing after his 4-year-old colt, a 50-1 longshot in a 
crowd of 58,240, became the second most improbable winner in the 52-year 
history of the Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
The red-eyed Irwin, his legs considerably more rubbery than his horse's, needed 
the support of his wife, Becky, to go from the winner's circle to the champagne 
toasts in the director's room. 
</P>
<P>
Martial Law, a Pennsylvania-bred, English-raced horse who had not run on dirt 
until five weeks ago, overhauled a tiring Triteamtri in the last eighth of a 
mile for a 1 3/4-length victory in the $1-million Big 'Cap. The first three 
horses across the wire were the three longest prices on the board in the 
11-horse field, with Triteamtri, at 40-1, hanging on for second by a head over 
Stylish Winner, an 80-1 shot. 
</P>
<P>
Nasr el Arab, the 17-10 favorite, apparently couldn't adjust to the ungiving 
Santa Anita main track and finished eighth. Cherokee Colony, the second choice, 
ran sixth with no excuses and Super Diamond, the sentimental favorite who was 
trying to become the first 9-year-old to win the race, wound up last after 
staying in contention for the first six furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
Martial Law, paying $103.60, $30.60 and $11.80, delivered a win price that was 
topped only by Bay View, a $116.40 shocker in the 1941 Big 'Cap. Triteamtri's 
prices were $29.80 and $17 and Stylish Winner paid $14. 
</P>
<P>
Running 1 1/4 miles in 1:58 4/5, Martial Law missed Affirmed's stakes record, 
set in 1979, by only a fifth of a second. Martial Law also became only the 
second of 15 supplemental entries -- after Prince Dantan in 1974 -- to ever win 
the Big 'Cap. Somehow, Jamie Schloss, the president of the 19-member Clover 
Racing Stable that races Martial Law, was able to get a consensus to agree to 
put up the $25,000 penalty that had to be paid because the horse was not 
nominated. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Pedroza, Martial Law's 23-year-old Panamanian jockey, didn't have a 
vote, but he did have influence. Pedroza rode Martial Law in his first American 
start in late January. After that fourth-place finish in his dirt debut, the 
horse came back in the mud to win an allowance race by six lengths three weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning at the track, Bobby Frankel, the trainer of Triteamtri, saw 
Pedroza working horses and said: "Hey, Martin, don't press me today. If there's 
a slow enough pace, we might be 1-2 in this race." 
</P>
<P>
After telling the story, Frankel added: "So we were 1-2. But I didn't know that 
this horse would beat me." 
</P>
<P>
Under moderate early fractions, Triteamtri led from the start, with Super 
Diamond closest and Martial Law in third place. When Super Diamond dropped out 
on the turn for home, Martial Law moved up. Coming from the outside, he edged 
ahead of Triteamtri at the eighth pole and widened the lead the rest of the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"I was whipping and praying at the end," said Pedroza, whose career highlight 
before Sunday's $550,275 victory may have been a stakes race at the Los Angeles 
County Fair. "I have been working this horse as well as riding him, and I liked 
his chances. A lot of people thought we were crazy, but as long as the horse 
had four legs, we might as well have run. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Gary (Stevens, aboard Triteamtri) coming out a little with his horse in 
the stretch, and all I wanted to do was stay clear. I had so much horse today. 
I have never been this happy." 
</P>
<P>
Martial Law carried 113 pounds, making him the lightest winner of the Big 'Cap 
since Linmold carried 110 pounds in 1960. Nasr el Arab was Sunday's high weight 
at 124 pounds and Triteamtri carried 116. 
</P>
<P>
The day started for the Clover group with its Galba winning the $100,000 New 
Orleans Handicap by a nose over Honor Medal at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans. 
He paid a mere $63. 
</P>
<P>
Julio Canani trains Martial Law, and Neil Drysdale trains both Galba and Honor 
Medal, who has different owners. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for Neil a little bit," Irwin was saying before the Big 'Cap, 
after the New Orleans result had come in. "Those Honor Medal people really like 
to win, and here Neil beats them with another one of his own horses." 
</P>
<P>
Martial Law is a son of Mr. Leader and Sateen, a Round Table mare. That makes 
Sunday's winner a grandson of Round Table, who in 1958 paid $2.30 and is still 
the shortest-priced winner of the Big 'Cap. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Rashid al Maktoum, the Dubai oil sheik who races Nasr el Arab, wanted 
to sell Martial Law last summer, in the middle of a 3-year-old season that 
produced two victories in six starts. But the asking price was $100,000 and the 
Clover group thought that was too high. 
</P>
<P>
In October, with the year's racing behind him, Martial Law was sold for about 
$30,000 at an auction in Newmarket, England, and the buyer, a friend of Irwin's 
turned around and sold the horse to Clover for $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew this horse's family," said Irwin, a former columnist for the Daily 
Racing Form. "Mr. Leader has sired horses that have won $26 million, but all 
but about $500,000 was on grass. That's why we thought this horse might turn 
out to be a nice dirt runner." 
</P>
<P>
Triteamtri was 20-1 on the morning line, but with the track favoring speed, 
Stevens thought more of his chances as the race drew closer. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we should have been about 6-1," the jockey said. "Then when the 
track kept playing the way it was, I thought we should be 5-2. He was 
struggling at the end, and I think the distance is a tad longer than he wants 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
"When the winner opened up on us, my horse started running again. He was 
wilting and caving in in the last 100 yards, but he got second only on heart." 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron rode Cherokee Colony. 
</P>
<P>
"The horse was trying to get out on me the whole way," McCarron said. "He just 
wasn't trying to run. But even if he had run his race, it might not have made 
much difference." 
</P>
<P>
Laffit Pincay couldn't explain Super Diamond's abrupt collapse. "I got him 
clear on the outside where I wanted him going down the backside," Pincay said. 
"Going to the three-eighths pole, I had no horse. He really stopped. But he 
came back fine." 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Charlie Whittingham, who started three horses -- Payant, Nasr el Arab 
and Frankly Perfect -- as he tried to win his eighth Big 'Cap, finished fourth, 
eighth and 10th, respectively.

"I think the track stung Nasr el Arab's feet hard," Whittingham said. "The 
other horse (Payant) couldn't get through." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker, riding Payant in what may be the jockey's last Big 'Cap, was in 
close quarters along the rail, but he said there was enough room to move if his 
horse had had anything left. 
</P>
<P>
The only horse with anything left was Martial Law. If the track photographer 
sells just one winner's circle picture to each one of the colt's owners, he 
might be able to retire immediately.

Ruhlmann, a 4-year-old colt running for the first time since he was moved from 
Bobby Frankel's to Charlie Whittingham's barn, won Sunday's Viking Spirit 
Stakes at Santa Anita and broke the track record for the mile with a clocking 
of 1:33 2/5. Ruhlmann, who won by 2 3/4 lengths, broke the record of 1:33 3/5 
that was set by Pompeii Court in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant Variety, who hadn't won since last March, captured the fifth race and 
was claimed from trainer Chris Speckert by Jerry Fanning for $80,000

ROCKETS' FLEX DEFENSE BEATS UP LAKERS, 88-83 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps the Lakers' problem Sunday was that they were not sure which sport was 
being played. Basketball may be their specialty, but the Lakers apparently felt 
they had to be more versatile than Bo Jackson and as strong as Dolph Lundgren 
to have any hope of beating the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
Groping for analogies after absorbing an 88-83 loss to the Rockets before 
16,611 at the Summit and a national television audience, the Lakers made 
references to everything from football to tag-team wrestling to the forgotten 
art of disco dancing. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like arm-wrestling out there," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mychal Thompson: "Going to the basket was like trying to drive through the 
Houston Oilers' defensive line." 
</P>
<P>
Added James Worthy: "They were doing the bump-and-grind on us." 
</P>
<P>
All the Rockets really did was get physical with the Lakers, who 
uncharacteristically recoiled, rather than responded, to strong-arm tactics 
that they have not seen recently while running past Pacific Division teams. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Lakers could have used Lundgren, the noted body-builder and purported 
actor in such films as "Masters of the Universe," in attendance Sunday while in 
town to shoot a movie. 
</P>
<P>
"We better get used to that style of play we saw today," Riley said. "Their 
tactics were more physical. They were committed to not letting let post up. 
They did a great job stopping Earvin (Magic Johnson) and keeping James in 
control. And, anything we took to the basket they contested." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Lakers had 16 fewer rebounds than the Rockets, made just 45% 
of their shots and saw their four-game winning streak stopped by a team that 
carried a seven-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
This, obviously, was not the manner in which the Lakers wanted to open a 
five-game southeastern trip. With their stated goal being the best record in 
the National Basketball Assn., the Lakers (39-18) had a chance to pull within 
three games of Cleveland, which lost at home to Milwaukee Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Lakers were pounded by the Rockets, although they could not have 
been too surprised by Houston's physical tactics. Maybe it was simply the 
degree of force inflicted that caught the Lakers unaware. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's burly inside combination of Akeem Olajuwon and Otis Thorpe dominated 
Laker forward A.C. Green and the center combination of Thompson and Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar. Olajuwon had 22 points and 17 rebounds, Thorpe 12 points and 14 
rebounds. And the Rockets, who made just 38% of their shots, had a 23-8 
offensive rebound advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, the Rockets shut off the middle, forced the Lakers to take 
perimeter shots and were so dominant on the boards that the Lakers got few 
second shots. 
</P>
<P>
Also, as several Laker players noted, the Lakers attempted only 15 free throws. 
Riley said it was because the Lakers did not drive to the basket enough, but 
Thompson, for one, placed blame elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be frustrating at times," said Thompson, who had 12 points and eight 
rebounds. "You don't mind it being a physical game when the refs call it. I 
never blame anyone -- we lost the game -- but we'd like to see the calls both 
ways." 
</P>
<P>
To the Lakers' thinking, the most important non-call came with eight seconds 
left and the Rockets holding an 86-83 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The play actually began with 14 seconds left. Michael Cooper, at mid-court, 
inbounded the ball to Johnson on the right perimeter. Johnson, just outside the 
three-point line, dribbled toward the top of the key. 
</P>
<P>
He then handed off to Byron Scott, who joined him just beyond the three-point 
line. Mike Woodson, guarding Scott, slipped through Johnson's screen and made 
contact with Scott, who stumbled and dribbled the ball off his leg and out of 
bounds. 
</P>
<P>
No foul was called, and a second later, Sleepy Floyd (22 points) sank two free 
throws to make it 88-83. 
</P>
<P>
"I got fouled, simple as that," said Scott, who scored only five of his 14 
points in the second half. "I was coming around the pick and Mike Woodson kneed 
me in the thigh. I couldn't believe it. There was no foul. It went from three 
(points) to five with that. I felt I would've had a good shot at (a three-point 
attempt)." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers would not have found themselves in such a dire circumstance had they 
maintained their dominating start. They had a 10-1 lead 4:25 into the game 
before Houston made its first field goal, led by 11 points after the first 
quarter and by nine points at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Rocket Coach Don Chaney brought in Lundgren for halftime pointers because 
they overpowered the Lakers after that. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' 37-point output in the second half was their third lowest total in 
a half all season. They saw a nine-point lead turn into a seven-point deficit 
during a 29-13 run by the Rockets, the Lakers pulling to within four points 
entering the fourth quarter thanks to Cooper's three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
Twice early in the fourth quarter, the Lakers missed chances to catch the 
Rockets. First, they were called for a 24-second clock violation, then Orlando 
Woolridge turned the ball over. 
</P>
<P>
With about a minute remaining, the Rockets had an 84-81 lead but missed two 
shots underneath. The ball was loose near the free-throw line, but Johnson 
reached out and slapped it to a streaking Cooper for a basket that made it a 
one-point deficit with 54 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Again, the Rockets' inside dominance prevented the Lakers from overcoming the 
deficit. Thorpe and Walter Berry eached missed shots, but the ball eventually 
bounced to Floyd, who sank a jump shot to make it 86-83 with 14 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's farewell tour resumed Sunday, as the Houston Rockets 
honored the retiring Laker center by presenting him with NASA memorabilia and a 
lap-top computer. Rocket General Manager Ray Patterson, who drafted 
Abdul-Jabbar in a similar position with the Milwaukee Bucks in 1969, took part 
in the ceremony. Abdul-Jabbar told the crowd that he has enjoyed playing in the 
city since his first game with UCLA in 1967. "We've had a great rivalry ever 
since (the 1960s), and I'd like to acknowledge the fans," Abdul-Jabbar said. 
"Back in 1986, we played the Rockets and got our butts kicked here (in Game 6 
of the playoffs). We went to the airport, and usually we'd be greeted with 
contempt. But I didn't hear one snicker or joke from the fans that night. A lot 
of fans could learn from you guys." . . . Orlando Woolridge, poked in the right 
eye Friday night against Golden State, was examined by a Houston doctor. 
Woolridge was given medication for the problem. . . . The Lakers play at 
Atlanta Tuesday night.

A NEEDED BREAK; 
</P>
<P>
SHRIVER TAKES TIME OUT FROM OUTSIDE COMMITMENTS TO FOCUS ON HER GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once, Pam Shriver decided to go to a movie. This is something she often does 
when she is on the road. The feature hadn't started yet in the tiny theater on 
Bourke Street in Melbourne, Australia, so Shriver went into the restroom. 
</P>
<P>
Two elderly women were standing just inside the restroom door as Shriver neared 
them on her way out. She was startled as they gasped in shock. 
</P>
<P>
"My word, this is the Gents'," one of the women said. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver did a quick personal audit. As usual, she measured a shade over six 
feet from the soles of her sneakers to the top of her brown, curly semi-short 
hair. Wearing blue jeans and a light jacket, Shriver realized that she had been 
mistaken for a man. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver quickly reassured the women that she was indeed no gender bender and 
they were in the right rest room. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they believed me," Shriver said. 
</P>
<P>
The women viewed Shriver suspiciously as she walked past. 
</P>
<P>
But this was the latest case of mistaken identity involving Pam Shriver. Why, 
it was nearly 11 years ago that she was being mistaken for Britain's Margaret 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver was 16 years old and more Maryland than crabcakes. According to a New 
York Times description, Shriver had more curls than Little Orphan Annie when 
she became the youngest finalist in the history of the U.S. Open. The 
Lutherville, Md., schoolgirl won every set she played and defeated 
then-Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova in the semifinals before losing to 
Chris Evert in the final. 
</P>
<P>
Even at such a young age, Shriver was impressive. To many, she was the 
reincarnation of Court, but leaner and hungrier. A serve-and-volley player, 
Shriver stood out in the women's game, where the party line was the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, all of it must have seemed pretty simple to Shriver. The world 
was her oyster, or at the very least, a steamed clam. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure how high my expectations were, but I thought things would be 
easy," she said. "I thought that the progression would be finals one year, 
maybe I'll struggle (in the) semifinals, quarterfinals a year or so, but I'd 
win it within the next few years. 'Who is this Chris and Martina anyway?' But 
pretty soon, I was definitely back down to earth." 
</P>
<P>
Years passed. Shriver grew up, all the while playing tennis. She became a 
well-rounded person, a champion of causes, a salmon fisher in Canada. And she 
developed a fondness for politics. Born on the Fourth of July, she bleeds red, 
white and blue. Shriver was a collector of Australian art when it was 
fashionable and a Baltimore Orioles fan when it was not. She knew something 
about a lot of things. Her interest rate was 100%. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Pam Shriver is 26 and winning the U.S. Open, or any other Grand Slam 
singles event, hasn't happened. It is the only chunk missing out of what has 
been an otherwise complete life of tennis and Shriver wonders if this is 
something that is actually meant to be. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even without a Grand Slam title, since 1983 Shriver has been able to hang 
onto a place near the top of the rankings, right there a few rungs below Steffi 
Graf, and also Navratilova and Evert, who are her contemporaries in terms of 
tour of duty, if not success. Although that missing element gnaws slightly at 
Shriver's insides, she is at the same time proud of her station. 
</P>
<P>
"To be the only one that hasn't had the glory of Grand Slams and still be able 
to keep the drive is something that I'd say in my career I'm most proud of," 
Shriver said. "OK, she hasn't held up the Wimbledon trophy or the U.S. Open 
trophy or even the Australian, but doggone it, she's been a contender that long 
and she hasn't lost her mind." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not, but for a while there recently, Shriver thought she might have 
misplaced it. 
</P>
<P>
At this very moment, Shriver has not played singles in a tournament since 
shortly after seeing that movie in Melbourne. She lost to Catarina Lindqvist in 
the third round of the Australian Open, 0-6, 6-4, 8-6, then pulled out of 
singles in events at Washington and San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
She said that her singles game had sunk so low, she couldn't find it on radar. 
Because of all her obligations and commitments, Shriver felt her tennis was 
being shortchanged. She was spread too thin. 
</P>
<P>
"It hit me when I was in Australia that I had eight zillion things to do," she 
said. "I realized I had no time for myself. I just needed to take a breather." 
</P>
<P>
This was no case of burnout, Shriver said. Something wasn't quite right in her 
life and the symptoms showed in her tennis. 
</P>
<P>
She began adding up the major commitments of her time and energy. She soon 
realized that she: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is on the board of directors of the McDonough School, a private school near 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Runs the Orchard Indoor Tennis Club at Towson, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is a vice president of the Womens International Tennis Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Serves on the President's Council on Physical Fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Produces a Cystic Fibrosis celebrity tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is involved in various public-service projects. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Shriver has discussed with the Bush Administration the possibility 
of getting involved in a youth-service agency in which she would work with kids 
to persuade them to get involved in helping others. 
</P>
<P>
Evert sent Shriver a message of sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
"It said: 'Dear Pam, I had a mini-emotional breakdown when I was 24 or 25,' " 
Evert said. "John Lloyd and I were on the cover of People magazine and it was 
like "Chris Retires." I took a sabbatical, four or five months off, because I 
was very emotional. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I stepped out on the court, I was crying," Evert said. "I was 
thinking, 'This isn't me. Something's not right.' I had just gotten married and 
I was confused how career, marriage and family fit in. 
</P>
<P>
"Pam takes on a lot more than I ever did," Evert said. "I was pretty 
single-minded when I was younger, but Pam is involved in other aspects, so it 
caught up with her. She's an extremely well-rounded person." 
</P>
<P>
Now, though, she's slightly less so. Last week, Shriver leased some office 
space in Lutherville and is hiring someone to take off some pressure in her 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't let outside things gnaw away at your singles game to a point where 
you can't play," Shriver said. 
</P>
<P>
She also parted with Bud Schultz, one of her coaches, after the Australian 
Open. Shriver said that Schultz wanted to alter her philosophy of preparing for 
matches, which she considered a solid fundamental and one she did not want to 
give up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very, very fragile thing," Shriver said. "I wouldn't expect anyone who 
hadn't known me for years and years and years to know it. You can't replace 
that familiarity. It was like a change of who I was about. At 26, I couldn't do 
that, and it would hurt my tennis." 
</P>
<P>
Hank Harris, who has been Shriver's hitting coach for years, is being counted 
on more than before, as is Don Candy, the former Australian Davis Cup player, 
who was Shriver's guru. 
</P>
<P>
"Don is going to be a resource for as long as I play," Shriver said. "He 
doesn't come to all the tournaments, but all the major ones. Day in and day 
out, (since) he's going to be 60 this month, obviously his working-out days are 
finished." 
</P>
<P>
So it is a new and presumably revitalized Shriver descending on Indian Wells 
this week for the $250,000 Virginia Slims tournament at Hyatt Grand Champions. 
After laying off tournament singles for about six weeks, Shriver is confident 
her tennis will show improvement, now that she has begun to sort out her 
business and personal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll play my best tennis," she said. "In a year and a half, I'll 
either be playing the best tennis of my life and loving it, or I won't be 
playing singles anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I play my tennis, I give it 100%, as much as this body-type can, but at 
the same time, I really get excited about the things I've been exposed to and 
the people I've met. The people I get to know now will be able to help me make 
that transition into whatever I'm going to do later." 
</P>
<P>
Shriver said she has been intrigued by meeting some top executives at Philip 
Morris, the parent company of Virginia Slims, which has sponsored the women's 
professional tennis tour since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"The odds of going to work with Philip Morris would, I guess, be slim . . . ha, 
ha," Shriver said. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the political arena may be appealing to Shriver, who campaigned for 
both Ronald Reagan and George Bush. But Shriver said the boundaries of her 
support may be slightly broader than is widely assumed. She also has 
contributed to the campaigns of Rep. Tom McMillen and Gov. William Schaefer, 
both Maryland Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I'm a little bipartisan," she said. "I don't advertise it too much." 
</P>
<P>
One of three daughters of Sam and Margot Shriver, Pam was 3 when she started 
going to the tennis courts with her parents. She used a sawed-off squash 
racket. When she was 9, Shriver began taking lessons at the Orchard Indoor club 
from Candy, who was the pro. 
</P>
<P>
A student of famed Australian tennis master Harry Hopman, Candy found Shriver a 
talented pupil. By late 1977, when Shriver was 15 and ready to play on the Avon 
Futures circuit, she asked Candy to travel with her full-time. 
</P>
<P>
In early 1978, Shriver won the Avon Futures in Columbus, Ohio, getting through 
pre-qualifying, qualifying and the main draw. A buoyed Shriver entered the 
Virginia Slims of Dallas and scored surprising victories over Dianne Fromholtz 
and Kerry Reid before losing to Evonne Goolagong Cawley in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
That summer, Shriver found herself on Centre Court at Wimbledon. Shriver held 
three match points on Sue Barker, but wound up losing. She returned to playing 
in junior events and lost to Tracy Austin in the final of the national 16 and 
18 championships. Next came her stunning debut at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver defeated Navratilova in two tiebreakers in a semifinal that was twice 
delayed by rain. Then in the final against Evert before a packed stadium, 
Shriver lost, 7-5, 6-4, after leading, 5-4, in the first set and, 4-3, in the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
At 16, she was the youngest woman ever to reach the Open final. 
</P>
<P>
She hasn't been back since. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Shriver remembers what she went through after her narrow loss the 
very first moment she burst upon the scene at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great to get to the finals, but all the baggage that came with it was a 
shame," she said. "But you can't have one without the other. Just like Becker 
won two Wimbledons before he was 20, so he's supposed to win eight out of 10. 
</P>
<P>
"So it could have been worse -- I could have won it," she said. "Well, I guess 
that would have been better." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take long to find out that this Open business wasn't a snap. 
</P>
<P>
After going back to McDonough school and not playing for three months, Shriver 
joined the 1978 Wightman Cup team and played No. 3 singles, losing to Michelle 
Tyler, a little-known English player at the Royal Albert Hall. That was the 
last time the United States lost the Wightman Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a horrible experience," Shriver said. "I knew then that things were not 
going to be easy." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, they got worse. Shriver turned pro in early 1979, but did not win a 
match from June to November. She played five tournaments and lost in the first 
round of each. 
</P>
<P>
And during the summer in Chichester, England, she injured her shoulder while 
hitting an overhead in warmups. She still wears mounds of ice packs on her 
right shoulder after matches, looking like a Quasimodo whose hump has shifted a 
little to the right. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver returned to the U.S. Open, the scene of her greatest triumph. She lost 
in straight sets to Julie Harrington in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
"To have all that happen within one year of when you've gotten through to the 
finals is really extreme," Shriver said. "But within one year of getting my low 
in the rankings (36), I was in the top 10. It's like 1980 was my big recovery 
year." 
</P>
<P>
And Shriver had just turned 18. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Shriver has managed to delight audiences and entertain the media 
with her tennis and her comments about tennis, in that order. 
</P>
<P>
She has also shown an ability to occasionally infuriate opponents with biting 
on-court remarks. In Toronto in 1981, for instance, Shriver said something 
vulgar to Austin, who Shriver felt was taking things a little bit too 
seriously. Shriver later sent an apology. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver has also been one of the top deflected-cursers in the sport. When she 
gets really angry, she speaks naughty words to the back of her hand. Of course, 
such peccadilloes are part of Shriver's charm, now that she has been around 
long enough to be appreciated as one of the continuing standard-bearers of the 
women's game. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Slam titles? 
</P>
<P>
Shriver actually has 21 of them. They are all doubles titles, though, 20 of 
them with Navratilova as a partner. 
</P>
<P>
She vows to play well at Wimbledon this year because she can be more focused, 
now that her schedule is settled somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, time is always the issue, especially not having enough of it to go 
around. Shriver, who takes her responsibilities seriously, may soon get an even 
bigger one when Evert retires as both player and WITA president. Shriver would 
almost surely move up. 
</P>
<P>
Since the days of Billie Jean King, it is traditional that the No. 1 player sit 
at the head of the players' group, but Evert senses an absence of interest in 
that role now, especially among No. 1 Steffi Graf and her youthful challenger, 
Gabriela Sabatini. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say right now that the state of women's tennis is very, very healthy," 
Evert said. 
</P>
<P>
"But the problem might be in the leadership aspect, off the court," she said. 
"Martina and I were taken under Billie Jean's wing, we were open to learning, 
to the WITA and responsibilities. Pam, too. I don't see the other players 
opening up and saying to the top players, 'We'd like to continue to carry the 
torch.' I'm sort of throwing it off to their youth. 
</P>
<P>
"They're young, they're single-minded, and, quite frankly, I wouldn't want a 
bunch of 18- and 19-year-old girls to run the game. But what they could do is 
attend more board meetings, more general meetings, just show up two or three 
times a year, read the material we send them." 
</P>
<P>
Shriver always shows up when and where she is supposed to. On her return flight 
from Australia, Shriver landed at Los Angeles International airport, did one 
interview, then hopped a plane to Palm Springs for another round of interviews. 
She did all this on one hour's sleep. 
</P>
<P>
She spent the rest of the time between Sydney and LAX doing her bookkeeping and 
writing in her journal. Last spring, Shriver touched on the No. 3 ranking for a 
while after she began the year by winning tournaments in Brisbane and Sydney, 
Australia. She went on to win the Pan Pacific and the European Indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver, as usual, did not play in the French Open, lost in the semifinals at 
Wimbledon and the second round of the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
"A disastrous summer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I realized is that no matter how bad my results are or how good my 
results are, you are never quite sure what's around the corner. So what you do 
is you just keep preparing and being as enthusiastic as you can about your game 
and your life style." 
</P>
<P>
The year ended happily for Shriver at the Virginia Slims championships. She 
beat Evert and Graf on the way to the final, where she lost to Sabatini. Even 
so, it all looked pretty good to Shriver. 
</P>
<P>
"Once upon a time, if I beat Chrissie and Graf back-to-back, that would have 
been good enough to have won a pretty big title," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A Slam, possibly? 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it is timing and luck," she said. "I just think if you're there 
knocking long enough, at some point it's going to happen. But if it doesn't, 
onward." 
</P>
<P>
This week, at Indian Wells, the draw is small, only 28, and just about anyone 
could win. The usual suspects: Evert, Helena Sukova, Shriver, Lori McNeil. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver will have some help in her corner -- her two grandmothers are coming to 
see her play. 
</P>
<P>
Marion (Moppie) Ketcham, 80, is Margot Shriver's mother and lives in San Diego. 
Eleanor (Ga Ga) Shriver, 78, Sam Shriver's mother, will come from Pennsylvania 
to watch granddaughter Pam play. 
</P>
<P>
Marion Ketcham is a four-times-a-week player on the courts at Hotel del 
Coronado on Coronado Island. Shriver sent her a Valentine's Day card. 
</P>
<P>
"She wrote on it, 'Palm Springs, here we come,' " Ketcham said. "She has too 
much energy. She's a great girl and she doesn't have just tennis. But she's 
done so many other things, it's too bad one thing she hasn't done is won a big 
singles title. I know it's within her to want a Grand Slam singles title." 
</P>
<P>
Ketcham said, however, that Shriver is more of a doubles player than a singles 
player, which seems fair considering Shriver's Grand Slam doubles record. 
</P>
<P>
"The little girls can move faster," she said. "But with her long legs and long 
arms, she can use those on just about anybody and get to the finals. Whether 
she can win it, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
This assessment seems fair. It is something Pam Shriver probably can live with. 
She is waiting for her moment to come around again. There have already been so 
many, not the least of which was winning the gold medal with doubles partner 
Zina Garrison at the Seoul Olympics. Barcelona and 1992, which aren't that far 
off, are the end of the line for her, Shriver said. 
</P>
<P>
But until then? And what if there are no more great moments? 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I've had a great run," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And when yet another moment comes, when she decides to stop playing, Shriver 
already has a retirement speech prepared -- what will be said about her. 
</P>
<P>
This is what she hopes people will say: "Isn't it great that she finally won a 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
"But if it doesn't happen, I just hope they say, 'There's someone who was fun 
to watch. She hung in there.' "

TWO FIGHTERS WHO WERE IN THEIR PRIME FIVE YEARS AGO MEET TONIGHT AT RENO

<TEXT>
<P>
This is a nostalgic time. The 50s, the 60s, the 70s, they're all in. How else 
to explain "The Brady Bunch Reunion," "The Wonder Years" or tonight's fight 
between former world champions Ray (Boom Boom) Mancini and Hector (Macho) 
Camacho. 
</P>
<P>
It's probably no fair to dump on this match, a once attractive fight that is 
only five years delayed. 
</P>
<P>
There is on the horizon similar plunderings of history, Sugar Ray Leonard and 
Tommy Hearns for example, a rematch that made sense about seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
For that matter, Marvelous Marvin Hagler is said to be in the gym. And Roberto 
Duran, his hands of stone considerably softened 10 years after his greatest 
glory, is back in the picture, ready to entangle in each of the aforementioned 
in boxing's version of a senior's tour. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too (and this is beyond comment), there is George Foreman, lumbering 
through a parade of hand-picked heavyweights, more than a decade after his 
prime. 
</P>
<P>
The fight scene these days is like one of those ads on late-night television, a 
recycling of greatest hits. That may say a lot about the fight scene, if all 
that enlivens it is an old-timer's game. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's fight, its live gate sold out and much of its pay-per-view money in 
hand, may say the most. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini was a popular and durable lightweight until Livingstone Bramble lifted 
the title here in Lawlor Events Center nearly five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini fought Bramble again in 1985, his lone fight of the year, lost and quit 
to pursue acting. Mancini was never considered sharp. He was a brawling, gutsy 
competitor, relying less on athletic edge than his swarming style. That was 
good for a 29-3 record, lots of notoriety and money. 
</P>
<P>
His life style out of the ring -- a little flashy as success came but 
nevertheless everybody's idea of the perfect son -- certainly enhanced his 
appeal. He was a clean liver in a sport that was increasingly riddled with 
drugs and worse. 
</P>
<P>
So this match was once perfect. Camacho, a lively sprite who outgrew what could 
charitably be described as juvenile delinquency in New York's Spanish Harlem, 
has never had it in his mind to do a milk commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Outspoken and outrageous, his colorful suit of lights probably raises middle 
America's blood pressure a good 10 points, he is everything Mancini is not. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini would have you believe that this match represents a chance to achieve 
justice, to squash this former con (3 1/2 months for grand theft auto) for the 
good of the young innocent children. Camacho relishes the angle as it is 
providing him with a reported $1.5 million payday. 
</P>
<P>
But the angle is about all there is. Promoters have secured the sanctions of 
something called the World Boxing Organization but that is thin premise. All 
that's here is a grudge match. 
</P>
<P>
And it's a grudge match that is years too late to amount to anything more than 
light entertainment -- a reprise of Maxwell Smart. These things may sell, but 
they are not likely to satisfy. 
</P>
<P>
Though still undefeated, Camacho, 34-0, has let his glory slip away, too. 
</P>
<P>
In his prime, in the early 80s, his athletic skills were supreme. Never the 
brawler that his nickname suggested, he was a surprising athlete in the ring. 
With a flamboyance that not even his sequined robes could hide, he won the 
super featherweight title in 1983, moved up to lightweight in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
But he only defended it twice and then disappeared. He has had just three 
fights since his last defense, once in 1987, twice last year. 
</P>
<P>
Camacho has had a number of trainers and, reports were, a far larger number of 
meals. 
</P>
<P>
The pre-fight suspense was supposed to be the weigh-in; neither seemed a lock 
to make 140 pounds. But only the night owls would find resolution to that. 
After much going back and forth, the parties agreed to tip the Toledos at 2:30 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
It's the time of day, when you think about it, that appeals for recycled hits 
are most intense.

ANGEL NOTEBOOK;

BLYLEVEN LOSES A REAL LAUGHER, 5-1

YUMA, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the team buses weaved their way out of downtown Yuma Sunday afternoon, 
embarking on the 200-mile trek back to Mesa, the Angel question of the hour was 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Where's the beef? 
</P>
<P>
More than a few Angel players had to wonder when they unwrapped their postgame 
sandwiches, expecting the succulent steak they signed up for earlier, only to 
find meager ham and cheese staring back at them. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, that Bert Blyleven. 
</P>
<P>
Throwing out the first major prank of the spring, Blyleven posted a clubhouse 
sign-up sheet Sunday morning bearing the heading: Steak Sandwiches for Bus Ride 
To Mesa. Underneath was a column for players' names and a column for number of 
sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
The first name of the sheet belonged to Blyleven, along with an order: "medium, 
one, w/mayo." 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, 18 other names and orders accompanied it. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen Angels were suckered -- hook, line and sinker. 
</P>
<P>
It's an old gag, Blyleven confided to reporters after pitching three innings in 
the Angels' 5-1 loss to the San Diego Padres, but it always seems to work on a 
new team. 
</P>
<P>
"Every club I've been on has done that during spring training, on the first 
long bus trip," Blyleven said. "You always get the young kids. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'Steak sandwiches? Really?' And you tell them, 'Oh, yes, son, you're 
in the big leagues, now. Steaks. First class.' " 
</P>
<P>
But even a few Angel veterans bit -- Jack Howell, Greg Minton, Dick Schofield, 
Devon White -- which pleased Blyleven no end. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell me Minton was sitting there for five minutes, trying to figure out 
what he wanted on it," Blyleven gleefully reported. 
</P>
<P>
The conversation eventually turned to meatier matters, such as Blyleven's 
spring debut, in which he allowed three runs on six hits and wound up the 
losing pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
The smile evaporated from Blyleven's face. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody likes to go out there and get hit," Blyleven said. "I don't like to 
give up any . . . runs. It ticks me off. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could computerize myself. The program would say: No runs. But I'm not 
a computer. If I was, I'd be a lot happier." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven kept away from his calling card -- the home-run pitch -- but was 
squibbed and dribbled to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
In the first inning, Tony Gwynn reached base on an error by Howell and scored 
on an infield single by John Kruk. In the third inning, another infield single 
moved Tim Flannery into scoring position for Carmelo Martinez, who drove him in 
with a double to left. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Blyleven threw real well," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "Schoey 
(shortstop Dick Schofield) let one ball go through and there were some other 
squibble balls that went through. 
</P>
<P>
"But his velocity was OK. I thought he threw well." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's loss completed a three-game Yuma sweep for the Angels, which, counting 
exhibition games, extends the club's losing streak there to 15 straight. Since 
last Sept. 18, Angel managers have posted these records: Cookie Rojas, 0-4; 
Moose Stubing, 0-8; Doug Rader, 0-3. It's been an arid stretch, but Rader isn't 
worried -- yet. "I doubt too many people will remember this game two weeks from 
now," he said. "I just don't want it to become a trend. I don't want losing to 
be the expected, rather than the unusual." 
</P>
<P>
This Wasn't The Idea: The list of injured Angels left behind in Mesa this 
weekend grew larger by the time returned to camp Sunday night. Held back 
because he wasn't scheduled to pitch in Yuma, Dan Petry developed a stiff right 
shoulder during Saturday workouts and was scratched from today's game against 
the Chicago Cubs. Dave Concepcion, kept behind in order to work out at 
shortstop, also hurt himself, coming up with a sore hamstring and a tight lower 
back. The Angels don't regard either injury as serious but Petry's spring debut 
has been pushed back to Friday. Non-roster pitcher Gary Buckels will replace 
Petry today.

the Edmonton Oilers stretched their winning streak to six games with a 4-2 
victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins Sunday night at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Tikkanen scored at 14:15 of the second period and added an empty-net goal with 
19 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh's Mario Lemieux, the NHL's leading scorer, was held without a point 
for the second consecutive game. The Penguins are 2-6 when Lemieux has been 
scoreless this season. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec 8, Buffalo 2 -- Peter Stastny scored two goals and his brother, Anton 
Stastny, added three assists as the Nordiques routed the Sabres at Buffalo.

<P>
New York Islanders 4, Winnipeg 3 -- Alan Kerr scored two goals and assisted on

</P>
<P>
Boston 5, New York Rangers 0 -- Cam Neely and Bob Sweeney scored two goals 
apiece as Bruins' goaltender Andy Moog continued his mastery over the Rangers

</P>
<P>
Moog, 7-1-2 lifetime against the Rangers, had 41 saves while recording the 
fifth shutout of his career as Boston ran its unbeaten streak to eight games. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 2, Minnesota 0 -- Brendan Shanahan scored a goal and set up one by 
Doug Brown to back the shutout goaltending of Sean Burke, who stopped 30 shots 
as the Devils beat the North Stars at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The Devils moved to within eight points of the final playoff spot the Patrick 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 3, Vancouver 0 -- Goaltender Don Beaupre turned away 24 shots while 
blanking the Canucks and the Capitals moved past Pittsburgh into second place 
in the Patrick Division.

Third-seeded Guy Forget of France earned the second tournament victory of his 
career, defeating seventh-seeded Michiel Schapers of the Netherlands in the 
final of the $130,000 Lorraine Open Sunday at Nancy, France. 
</P>
<P>
"Guy had very good serves," said Schapers, who lost, 6-3, 7-6. "My legs were a 
little slow and he was faster than me on the court. That makes all the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
After wrapping up the first set easily, Forget had to rally to win the 
second-set tiebreaker. Schapers moved ahead, 4-1, in the tiebreaker, but Forget 
tied it, 5-5, before winning, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Forget's only previous tournament victory was in Toulouse, France, in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf coasted to her third title of the year with a 6-1, 6-4 victory over 
Ann Henricksson in the final of the U.S. women's hardcourt championships in 
chilly weather San Antonio, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, the world's No. 1 ranked player from West Germany, did not lose a set 
during the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
At 2-2 in the second set, Graf got a service break after extending Henricksson 
to six deuce points. Henricksson held serve the rest of the match, but was 
unable to break Graf. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she believes she is playing better than her last year, the 19-year-old 
Graf said, "I think I am, but it's hard to show that the last two days (because 
of the adverse weather). But I felt it earlier in the week." 
</P>
<P>
Led by twins Tami and Teri Whitlinger, top-ranked Stanford took the women's 
national indoor collegiate team championship with a 6-0 victory over No. 2 
Florida in the U.S. Tennis Assn./ITCA tournament at Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
Tami, playing at No. 1 singles and ranked No. 1 nationally, defeated Nicole 
Arendt, 6-0, 6-4. At fourth singles, Tericlinched the title with her 2-6, 6-2, 
6-2 victory over Andrea Berger, giving Stanford a 5-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA took third place with a 5-4 victory over Georgia.

Rusty Wallace may have had the fastest car in the field at Sunday's running of 
the $507,600 Goodwrench 500 NASCAR Winston Cup race at North Carolina Motor 
Speedway in Rockingham, N.C., but speed in the pits was more important than 
speed on the track. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, 32, easily won a six-lap sprint to the finish after beating three-time 
Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt out of the pits during the final caution 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, in a Pontiac, beat Alan Kulwicki by 1.3 seconds and earned $72,100.

<P>
Geoff Brabham and Chip Robinson combined to win the Miami Grand Prix three-hour 
sports car race in the favored Nissan prototype. 
</P>
<P>
The race covered 131 laps and 244.97 miles. The winners averaged 81.358 m.p.h. 
and earned first-place money of about $55,000.

Sunday morning, though, he stopped off at a house of worship a few blocks from 
the race track, because something -- or someone -- was telling Julio to say a 
little prayer before the big race. It might have been Santa Anita herself. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon, a horse Julio trains went out and won a million-dollar race, 
at odds of 50-1. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides my kids being born, this is the greatest thing that ever happen to 
me," he said. "At least I can make my car payment now." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning, Jeff Siegel placed his bets. Not at the mutuel window. In the 
newspapers. He had handicapped the day's races, including the $1-million Santa 
Anita Handicap, for four California papers that carry his syndicated picks. And 
this is how he saw the great race going down: 
</P>
<P>
NASR EL ARAB Deserves top billing 
</P>
<P>
SUPER DIAMOND Old-timer exudes class 
</P>
<P>
GOOD TASTE Coming up to corker 
</P>
<P>
CHEROKEE COLONY Switch to McCarron 
</P>
<P>
MARTIAL LAW Beat softer in breeze 
</P>
<P>
Yes, fifth. Fifth out of 11. That's where Jeff Siegel pegged Martial Law for 
the finish line. Not in front. Not in the money. Not in the photo, unless they 
used a wide lens. Fifth. Middle of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
Fair, he thought. Fair to everybody. The way Siegel figured it: "I didn't want 
to pick him to win, because I didn't think he would. But I didn't want to pick 
him to run last, because I didn't want to blow my credibility entirely." 
</P>
<P>
See, Jeff Siegel owns Martial Law. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, owns him. Owns him with a bunch of partners. Ten partners. Fourteen 
partners. Varies, whoever's telling the story. 
</P>
<P>
"We've probably got people here now who think they're partners," Siegel said in 
the winner's circle, when flowers were draped around the neck of Martial Law, 
one of the longest longshots ever to win the richest handicap in thoroughbred 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
For the Clover Racing Stable, it was quite a day at the races. Early in the 
afternoon, another of its horses, one called Galba, was the longshot winner of 
the $100,000 New Orleans Handicap at the Fair Grounds in Louisiana, paying $63 
to win. Sweet. 
</P>
<P>
Then, an hour or two later, the decidedly anonymous Martial Law won a race 
previously won by the likes of Seabiscuit, Spectacular Bid, Affirmed, John 
Henry and Alysheba. He paid $103.60 for a two-buck ticket. He outran 40-1 and 
80-1 shots to the wire, in a horse race that more or less (no offense) went to 
the dogs. The exacta paid $3,717. Gracias, Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
For Jeff Siegel, things could not have gone better. 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe a little better. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't bet one nickel on him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That'll teach him not to follow those newspaper handicappers. 
</P>
<P>
Martial Law ran in England for a while, then was brought to Santa Anita last 
winter. Siegel and his partners thought they had a decent horse. Not the 
fastest horse in the world, but no hobby horse, either. 
</P>
<P>
They gave him to Canani to train. Julio worked with him. One day Siegel stopped 
by, and the trainer told him: "You know, this is a better horse than you 
think." 
</P>
<P>
The partners started thinking. With the Santa Anita Handicap coming up, they 
wondered whether they should send their horse against slower horses for a 
cheaper purse, or go for broke. 
</P>
<P>
The "early bird" nomination deadline of last August had passed, and with it the 
$500 entry fee. Then the Dec. 1 deadline passed, with its $2,000 fee. Then the 
Jan. 12 deadline, with its $2,500 fee. If the Clover folks wanted to enter 
Martial Law in the Big 'Cap, it was going to cost them a "supplemental" 
nominating charge of $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
They talked it over. They debated until the final afternoon. They consulted 
their trainer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to tell you he can't win," Canani told them. 
</P>
<P>
Siegel and the others voted to be brave. "We decided if we lose, we'll have a 
good time, and if we win, we'll have a good investment. Truthfully, though, we 
were prepared to get laughed at." 
</P>
<P>
On deadline day, Siegel told the trainer as he walked his horse that they were 
entering Martial Law in the Big 'Cap. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," Canani said, "even the horse turned around and gave us a dirty 
look." 
</P>
<P>
Race day: Siegel was excited, and happy that UCLA's basketball game with 
top-ranked Arizona was played the day before. If Siegel is not the No. 1 UCLA 
fan in the country, he would certainly make the Associated Press Top 20. He 
follows their football and basketball teams, home and away, even though he 
attended San Jose State and Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Siegel was excited because it hadn't rained, and he figured Nasr El Arab might 
run better wet than dry. And Super Diamond, another favorite, was 9 years old, 
no spring chicken. Martial Law's chances looked better and better, even though 
his odds remained lousy. 
</P>
<P>
The handicapper-owner watched them run from the press box. Six furlongs along, 
jockey Martin Pedroza had the horse third, and Siegel said: "Now at least we 
won't be embarrassed. We'll at least finish fifth." 
</P>
<P>
On the far turn, Super Diamond faded from second. Martial Law moved up. 
Siegel's eyes popped open. 
</P>
<P>
"Work him, Martin!" he started screaming. "Work him, Martin! Work him, Martin!" 
</P>
<P>
Pedroza worked him right across the finish line -- first. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, good investment. 
</P>
<P>
Siegel found a newspaper and looked up his comments. 
</P>
<P>
"'Beat softer in breeze,"' he read, next to Martial Law's name. "Not exactly 
memorable." 
</P>
<P>
He put it down, then picked it up. 
</P>
<P>
"Ah, but look at this, though," he said, and pointed. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the chart, the handicapper had written: "Longshot -- Martial Law." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that got somebody to put a nickel on him.

MARY BETH WHITEHEAD HAS A NEW STORYBOOK LIFE, AND SOME TOUGH TALK ABOUT 
SURROGATE MOTHERHOOD

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, four months pregnant with her fifth child, throws up 
in the bathroom as the sun goes down. 
</P>
<P>
"Morning sickness, day and night, with all my babies," she says when she's 
finished. "It's a cross I have to bear." 
</P>
<P>
Her fourth child, 9-month-old Austin, crawls on the kitchen floor with the 
Shetland sheep dogs. Her first child, 14-year-old Ryan, skateboards in the 
street outside. Her second child, honey-blond Tuesday, 12, flops in the front 
room with Jube Jel Cherry Candy Hearts, watching TV. And out in the kitchen, 
the world's most notorious surrogate mother, munching now on a bag of Fritos, 
remembers the beginning of Baby M, her third child, a feisty green-eyed girl 
who calls herself Sassy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Help the World' 
</P>
<P>
"Bill Stern would go into a little room and come out in a few minutes holding 
his semen in a cup," she says. "I really wanted to have that baby. I thought it 
was a way for me to help the world, you know. Boy, was I stupid. They'd 
inseminate me and I'd lie there with my feet in the air for 45 minutes. I'd 
stand on my head almost, because they told me it would make it easier for me to 
conceive. I had the baby, getting sick, all the pain, nursing her. What did 
Bill Stern do? He put some sperm in a cup." 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Stern, the product of that cold conception in a Manhattan high-rise, 
will be 3 this month, and she will celebrate her birthday twice. She will have 
a party at her home in Tenafly, N.J., with her father, William Stern, a 
biochemist, and his wife, Elizabeth, a pediatrician. Melissa will have a second 
celebration later with her mother, in this house on a half-acre in Bayport, 
Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
Life's little pleasures are multiplying behind blue shutters in Bayport. Mary 
Beth Whitehead isn't a New Jersey girl anymore. She lives in the storybook 
house she always wanted. She is divorced from Richard Whitehead, the former 
garbage man who married her when she was 16, fathered her first two children 
and then had a vasectomy because their doctor told him to. 
</P>
<P>
She has a new husband: Dean Gould, 27, who's four years younger than she. He is 
the comptroller for Management Consultants International, a Long Island 
real-estate management firm. She has a new baby and another one due in the 
summer. She has written a book telling her side of the Baby M case, and she was 
to start a 22-city tour to promote the book today. Next month she turns 32, 
happier and a little smarter. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people see me as a heroine. A lot of people see me as a whore. OK, 
I'm not perfect. I've made mistakes. I'd do a lot of things different if I 
could. I'd never, ever, get involved with surrogacy again. It's so weird. It's 
like going for your yearly." 
</P>
<P>
She is standing in bright-yellow socks, under a mushroom of L'Oreal medium 
brown that hides the gray in her hair. She's laughing toward a couple of 
ceramic rabbits that seem to be sniffing the Wonder Bread; the rabbits are two 
of 93 that romp in paper, plastic, glass, cloth and wood in the kitchen decor. 
"Most people have a child in a natural way, get the bottle of champagne, maybe 
put on a sexy nightgown. Me, I don't have to do that. You know what I'm saying? 
I'm not as green as I used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Sin on Seaman Avenue is a pint of rum raisin Haagen-Dazs in the freezer. 
</P>
<P>
"People wanted me to be like the Madonna, the white nun, you know, and that's 
not me. But I'm no villain. People come out of prison and aren't treated like 
I've been treated. I didn't kill anybody. I didn't violate anybody's rights. My 
rights were violated. Nobody likes to be hated, but the whole world hated Mary 
Beth Whitehead." 
</P>
<P>
The woman they attacked in the highly publicized court case as impulsive, 
egocentric, histrionic, narcissistic, manipulative and exploitive is religious 
in the sense that the church she doesn't attend much anymore is Catholic. 
Heaven is a cedar-shake house with a baby on her breast. 
</P>
<P>
"After what they did to me, I felt like there was nothing left for me. When I 
met Dean, I was just waiting to die. He made me alive again. . . . A lot of 
people said Dean was sent from heaven, and he was. And you know what? He never 
wanted kids. Now he has a tribe." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Beth Messer, the sixth of eight children, stopped going to school when she 
was 15, was married and pregnant at 16 and a mother at 17. "All my life I had 
wanted to be a mother," she writes in her book, "A Mother's Story: The Truth 
About the Baby M Case" (St. Martin's Press). "I had grown up believing that the 
purpose of my life was to have children." 
</P>
<P>
First came Ryan, then came Tuesday two years later. Before dawn on the day her 
first son was born, the teen-aged mother waited for her pains to come three 
minutes apart. "I lay awake all that night, alone, beside my drunk husband and 
beside an empty cradle," she writes. "I was beginning to understand that my 
life as a wife and mother was not going to be what I had always thought it 
would be." 
</P>
<P>
When she was 28, she answered an ad in the Asbury Park (N.J.) Press asking for 
women willing to have babies for infertile couples. The ad led her to baby 
broker Noel Keane and to William Stern, 41 at the time, and his wife, 
Elizabeth, also 41, who thought pregnancy might be risky because she had a mild 
case of multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Beth Whitehead was to be paid $10,000 under the contract she signed with 
the Sterns. On March 27, 1986, she gave birth to a girl, whom she had agreed to 
surrender. In her book, she says this was the moment when she changed her mind 
and decided to fight, even to run and hide, to keep her baby. 
</P>
<P>
Whitehead named the child Sara Elizabeth. The Sterns named her Melissa. The 
world knew her as Baby M. The Whiteheads and the Sterns swapped the child back 
and forth in the week after the birth, and then Whitehead kept the baby for 
four months, until she was forced to give her to the Sterns. The court battle 
was tedious and ugly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baby M's Adoption 
</P>
<P>
Four days after the baby's first birthday, New Jersey Judge Harvey Sorkow 
called Mary Beth Whitehead "a woman without empathy." He also said her husband 
"has been shown to be an episodic alcoholic." He said the Sterns were more 
emotionally and financially able to be Baby M's parents. The judge awarded the 
child to the Sterns and performed an adoption ceremony in his chambers that 
made Elizabeth Stern the legal mother of Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the world knew Mary Beth Whitehead as an unfit mother, and to prove it, 
they played in court a tape recording that Bill Stern had secretly made of a 
phone call from a desperate mother on the run: "I'd rather see me and her dead 
before you get her. I gave her life and I can take her life away." 
</P>
<P>
She didn't mean it, Whitehead-Gould says now. She was just mad and felt 
powerless. "It was such a stressful time. It was like they were crucifying me. 
I felt like Jesus Christ, I really did. I would never have hurt Melissa." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the judge terminated all her rights to the baby. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid to say it at the time of the trial because I didn't know what 
Judge Sorkow was going to do to me," Whitehead-Gould says, lighting a Newport 
cigarette at her kitchen table, "but I'm not afraid now: The judge was a 
rotten, horrible man, and I don't know how he sleeps at night." (Neither Sorkow 
nor the Sterns will comment on Whitehead-Gould or her book.) 
</P>
<P>
While recovering from the court decision that ended her parental rights, Mary 
Beth Whitehead met Dean Gould on a vacation in St. Thomas, and she later became 
pregnant with his child. Ten months after Sorkow's decision, the New Jersey 
Supreme Court upheld the award of custody to the Sterns, reinstated Whitehead's 
maternal rights and declared Elizabeth Stern's adoption invalid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visitation Rights 
</P>
<P>
Mary Beth Whitehead and her husband, Richard, were divorced, and two weeks 
later she married Gould. Last year she gave birth to her second son, Austin 
Dean Gould. Last year also, on her 31st birthday, another New Jersey judge 
awarded Mary Beth Gould liberal visitation rights and ordered that she and the 
Sterns enter psychological counseling together for the sake of the child they 
share. 
</P>
<P>
"The progress has been much better than anyone ever expected," Whitehead-Gould 
says. "We're civil. The Sterns won't let me into their lives, but there are no 
big disagreements anymore. We have come to terms with what works. We make the 
transition with my visitation as easily as can be. It's a start." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould emerges as a more sympathetic character in her book 
than the nation saw portrayed during her trial. She says she wrote the book to 
set the record straight, because she was misjudged and misunderstood, and to 
steer other women away from becoming "paid breeders." If she makes a little 
money, that's OK too. 
</P>
<P>
"If one girl reads it and decides not to go into surrogacy, then I think the 
book was worth it," she says. "These girls stand up publicly and say: 'It's 
wonderful. I'm giving the gift of life.' I have great sympathy for people that 
are infertile, but a life is not something you can give away." 
</P>
<P>
Her book, written in collaboration with Philadelphia journalist Loretta 
Schwartz-Nobel, has already hit the bookstores with a 100,000-copy first 
printing. It is a main selection of the Doubleday Book Club, an alternate 
selection of 
</P>
<P>
the Literary Guild and will be serialized in Family Circle magazine. 
</P>
<P>
It is a personal trip through the emotional moments of a woman confused, maybe 
even crazed, by surrogate motherhood. Whitehead-Gould writes about the night 
after she surrendered her baby to the Sterns: 
</P>
<P>
"The room was dark, and I was lying in a pool of milk. The sheets were full of 
milk. I knew it was time to feed my baby. I knew she was hungry, but I could 
not hear her crying. The room was quiet as I sat up in bed, alone in the 
darkness, with the milk running down my chest and soaking my nightgown. I held 
out my empty arms and screamed at the top of my lungs, 'Oh God, what have I 
done? I want my baby.' " 
</P>
<P>
If her book is a sad soap opera, so was Mary Beth Whitehead's surrogate 
motherhood, but the emotions, like the product, are real. 
</P>
<P>
"When she grows up, Sassy may look at Bill Stern and say, 'How could you do 
that to my mother?' She may be angry at me. But I know this, if I didn't fight 
to keep her, she'd be mad as hell. She'd say, 'How could you sell me? What kind 
of a mother are you?' There's so much that could still happen. Nobody knows. 
Time will tell." 
</P>
<P>
Just about everybody involved in the Baby M case came away with something. Just 
about everybody except Richard Whitehead. He didn't even get the Shetland sheep 
dogs, Corky and Jenny. After his wife divorced him, he didn't work for almost a 
year. He doesn't want to talk about his old life. 
</P>
<P>
"He's lonely," his ex-wife says. "He misses me. He misses the kids. He came 
here when we moved in, and he painted and watched the baby. My kids want me to 
build a garage apartment in the back yard or get a bigger house with a wing for 
daddy. I really wouldn't have a problem with that because we all do get along 
very well. But I don't think that's real healthy for Dean and Rick." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Whitehead just got a job driving a cement truck in Florida, and his 
ex-wife will split the money from her book with him. "It's part of the divorce 
decree," she says. "We will always love each other, but after all we went 
through, it died between us. I think Rick has what he wants now. He wanted to 
be footloose and fancy free. He's always had a hard time dealing with the 
responsibilities of a wife and children. So he really did get what he wanted, 
which is nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Her new husband for 15 months is a tall, dark, quiet man who wears glasses and 
white paint in his hair. He's been putting up rabbit wallpaper. Ryan and 
Tuesday Whitehead kiddingly call him Poindexter, the name of a wacky character 
in the movie "Revenge of the Nerds." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould says the emotional cost of surrogate motherhood may 
have been too high for her, but at least her third child, the girl who calls 
herself Sassy, is alive and lively. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the Sterns) refer to me as Bop. I used to call Melissa 'Oodie-Bop,' and 
the Sterns have turned it around. Show her a picture of me and she says 'Bop.' 
They don't acknowledge me as Melissa's mother, and I really feel like someday 
it's going to come back to get them. They're naive to think that this child is 
not going to have problems." 
</P>
<P>
The enemies in the Baby M case go to counseling together. They're not friends, 
but there's no more fighting. They all love Melissa. She's a feisty girl, but 
she won't be a little girl forever. She is, after all, Sassy, testy and 
demanding, just like her mother.

"The Sterns are intelligent people, with degrees in human genetics and 
everything," says Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould. "They must know that this child is 
going to grow up, maybe look like me, maybe act like me. There are certain 
characteristics that are hereditary, you know. How are they going to deal with 
a little Mary Beth growing up in their house?"

GETTING TO KNOW THE OLDEST OLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LARSEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beverly Sanborn remembers sharing a bedroom with her great-grandmother when she 
was 9. "I would be spellbound listening to her tell about her life. Before 
bedtime she would sometimes say, 'Oh, Bevy, it was such fun talking, but I hope 
tonight's my very last night and I'll go to heaven,' recalls Sanborn, who is 
director of Alzheimer services for a San Diego-based health-care group. 
</P>
<P>
"She was in pretty good health, and I would ask her why she would say something 
like that. And she would reply something like: 'I love being alive, but I have 
lived a whole lifetime. All the people I knew are gone, and I want to join 
them.' " 
</P>
<P>
According to Sanborn, such peaceful candor is typical of the elderly, 
particularly those who have lived to be 85 and older. It is one aspect of this 
fastest-growing age group, which she and two other authors spent three years 
researching for their new book, "Eighty-Five Plus -- The Oldest Old" (Wadsworth 
Publishing: $16). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Myth Dispelled 
</P>
<P>
One outcome of the research for the book, Sanborn said, has been to lay to rest 
the myth that adults in American families no longer wish to take care of their 
elderly. 
</P>
<P>
"Estimates now are that about 80% of the aged are cared for by family members," 
she said in an interview. "A lot of the remaining 20% have nobody left -- they 
have outlived their spouses, siblings, friends and, in some cases, their own 
children." 
</P>
<P>
This, Sanborn said, can be particularly true of the very old. 
</P>
<P>
"About 70% of these oldest old are women," Sanborn said. "And when the 
caregiver is an offspring, that person often is a grandmother who may herself 
have infirmities." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, she continued, regardless of how far along the aged ones are, 
"care of them within the family is becoming more typical, not less so." She 
adds that "this isn't any change in family attitudes -- it has been part of the 
American culture a long time. It's just that, 40 years ago, not that many 
people were living to the point where they needed care." 
</P>
<P>
They are now. In fact, according to the Social Security Administration, in 1950 
the oldest old (85 and older) comprised less than 5% of the population of those 
65 and older; by 2000, that percentage is predicted to be more than 14%. 
</P>
<P>
As for numbers, in 1980 those 85 and older totaled about 2.4 million, a figure 
that by the turn of the century is expected to soar to 5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
That this age segment is the fastest growing in the industrialized world was 
another reason for doing the book. Sanborn's coauthors in the endeavor are 
Sally Bould, associate professor of sociology at the University of Delaware, 
and Laura Reif, director of the graduate program in gerontological nursing at 
the University of California, San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
As Bould points out in the book's preface, "there are as many years between 60 
and 90 as there are between 20 and 50. For many of our parents . . . there may 
be an extra decade of life (they) have not planned on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interdependence Valued 
</P>
<P>
What the authors discovered as they probed and interviewed is that 
interdependence is more important to the most senior of seniors than 
independence is. 
</P>
<P>
"An interdependent life style often involves friends and neighbors as well as 
family," Sanborn said. "It can mean reciprocal helping. In the case of the 
family, a daughter, for instance, may help during a sickness, and the mother in 
turn may be able to do the shopping for her busy child." 
</P>
<P>
The book, which references a multitude of studies other than the authors', 
sheds some light on the relatively little-studied and rapidly growing age group 
comprising mid-octogenerians and older: 
</P>
<P>
* According to a study, 54% of them need the help of another person to manage 
their daily lives. For those 75 to 84, that percentage is only 22%. And for 
those between 65 and 74, the figure drops to about 8%. 
</P>
<P>
* More than 54% of the oldest old are concentrated in California, New York, 
Pennsylvania, Florida, Illinois, Texas, Ohio, Michigan, Massachusetts and New 
Jersey. California has the highest percentage: 9.7%. 
</P>
<P>
* According to "The Extreme Aged in America" by Ira Rosenwaike, it is the 
oldest old -- not the young old -- who are most likely to have changed their 
residence in the past five years. The changes are likely to have been prompted 
by widowhood, disability and institutionalization. 
</P>
<P>
* But the incidence of the very elderly living in the same home with adult 
children is sharply declining. For example, in 1950 a total of 32% of men 85 
and older who lived in the community were living in an adult child's household. 
By 1980, the proportion was only 9%. The tendency for such people to live alone 
may account for the myth that adult children don't take care of their aged 
parents, but the authors feel the current living arrangements reflect the 
preferences of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
* Among the oldest old, 48% of the men are married, but an oldest old woman's 
chance of having a spouse is only 8%. 
</P>
<P>
The author said she thinks young people sometimes miss out on a great 
opportunity -- getting to know that very old member of the family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Fear of Death 
</P>
<P>
Sanborn said one thing that fascinated her while researching this age group was 
discovering that, "on the whole, they aren't afraid of death." 
</P>
<P>
"Our culture is petrified at the thought of death. But not these people. They 
talk openly and often about it. They seem to have a real sense of moving on to 
something else, that they are at the last stage of life and that their journey 
on Earth is coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't at all ghoulish. The oldest old do it with a sense of acceptance. You 
hear them say things such as 'I'll see you tomorrow, if I'm alive.' 
</P>
<P>
"The oldest old somehow seem to know something we don't," Sanborn added. "They 
are closer to something. Maybe they are closer to a life truth. That, I think, 
explains our awe of the very old." 
</P>
<P>
More prevalent than the fear of death, she said, is the fear of becoming 
helpless. 
</P>
<P>
The author also said that while interdependence ranks high with these seniors, 
this doesn't mean that independence isn't cherished. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to feel that they aren't a burden. They want to maintain some sense 
of self. After all, in addition to having possibly lost their spouses, siblings 
and friends, they have probably also lost their bodies (as they were at a 
younger age). 
</P>
<P>
"One reason very old people don't like to move is that they feel a need to be 
surrounded by (familiar) objects and ways of life. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"When we are younger, we have social networks, and they do a lot to tell us who 
we are. The oldest old don't have that support network -- they must rely on 
internal means, such as remembering their lives. It is the reason they talk a 
lot about their pasts. They don't have external sources to remind them of who 
they are." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limits of Caregiving 
</P>
<P>
Regarding what Sanborn found to be a sincere effort by most American families 
to look after their aged ones, she cautioned that all should be aware of their 
limits as caregivers. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes people personally take care of someone too long, to the point of 
jeopardizing their own health. Caregiving can at times be so emotionally and 
physically draining that the person is pushed beyond the limit. You really see 
this in instances of Alzheimer's patients." 
</P>
<P>
Sanborn, who currently is setting up assisted living for Alzheimer's residents 
at Rancho Encinitas in San Diego County, said that when the point is reached at 
which a caregiver is stretched to the limit, there is nothing wrong with 
seeking options such as placement in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
"And friends should support any such decision," she added. "They should honor 
those who are able to stay with the caregiving, but at the same time recognize 
that the time sometimes comes when a change has to be made."

JACK SMITH: NO CHEERING ON THE SIDELINES FOR COLUMNISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes writing a column isn't as easy as it must seem to readers. Perhaps 
the worst bugaboo a columnist faces is the column he wishes he hadn't written, 
but is too late to recall. 
</P>
<P>
I have often written columns I wished I hadn't written. Many times I was able 
to retrieve and kill them before they could get into print and do the damage I 
was sure they would do. Sometimes the process had already gone too far, and I 
sat back in fear and trembling for the repercussions. As often as not, in these 
cases, no one said a word. My anxieties were wasted. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday was one of those critical days. Late Saturday night I decided that a 
column I had written for today was one I really didn't want to see in print. It 
wasn't libelous; it wasn't mean; it wasn't even inaccurate. I simply felt that, 
in telling one part of a story, I was not fair to the part I left out. That is 
a common fault with my columns, by the way. 
</P>
<P>
The View copy desk is not staffed on Saturday. I had to wait until Sunday 
morning to reach an editor. At 9 o'clock, I called. No one answered. I called 
The Times operator and asked if she could rouse someone on the copy desk. No 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:30 a.m., I decided I would have to drive downtown to the paper. I got in 
my car and took the Pasadena Freeway to the Sunset Boulevard turnoff and looped 
back on to Figueroa Street. I turned south, only to encounter a Road Closed 
sign. I couldn't believe it. That road had never been closed before. 
</P>
<P>
Then I saw the reason for it. Streams of people -- both men and women, 
evidently -- were loping west on Sunset Boulevard in their underwear. It took 
me two seconds to realize that I had run into the Los Angeles Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
I am content to suffer this annual madness as long as it does not interfere 
with my life. Only last year, as I remember, we had been trapped in the inner 
city by the encircling marathon when we went to a children's play produced by 
the Assistance League. I thought we'd never get out, and I'm afraid I said some 
rather mean things about the marathon. 
</P>
<P>
If 18,000 people want to get out on a nice March morning and gallop for more 
than two hours over hot asphalt streets, that is their business. But the cost 
to those of us who are caught inside their course or on its periphery can be 
frustrating in the extreme. 
</P>
<P>
It was different when the Greeks started the modern marathon at Athens in 1896. 
Athens was not a teeming metropolis with millions of cars that could easily be 
gridlocked by a few hundred amateur athletes trotting about its monuments over 
a 26-mile course. 
</P>
<P>
I can explain the Los Angeles Marathon only as one aspect of the current Los 
Angeles return to the Greek ideals of physical fitness. I'm not against 
physical fitness, but there were other Greek ideals that I wish we were more 
eager to return to. 
</P>
<P>
Following two other cars that had also encountered the roadblock, I made an 
illegal U-turn on Figueroa and turned east on Alpine, hoping to bypass the 
marathon and double back to The Times. I cursed when I saw, a few blocks ahead 
of me, the silhouettes of runners streaking across an intersection several 
blocks ahead. 
</P>
<P>
I knew now why no one had answered the phones on the copy desk. No one had been 
able to get to work. I gave up. I turned north on Hill Street and got back on 
the Pasadena Freeway and drove home. 
</P>
<P>
By then it was after 10 o'clock. I phoned again and got the head of the copy 
desk. I told him my problem. "'Is it possible," I asked, "to kill my Monday 
column?" 
</P>
<P>
He said, "If you can write a sub in 10 minutes or so." 
</P>
<P>
I told him I'd try. The column you are now reading, if you are still reading 
it, is the column I wrote as a substitute for today's original column. Its only 
virtue is that it was written in less time than it took those marathoners to 
finish their race. 
</P>
<P>
I think I deserve a laurel wreath.

CIRCUMCISION: CLEAR BENEFITS, SOME RISKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major policy shift, the nation's largest pediatricians' group has 
abandoned its long-held position that there are "no valid medical indications" 
for circumcising male infants, in favor of a finding that circumcision has 
clear medical advantages, balanced by some risks. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the new position by the American Academy of Pediatrics is 
scheduled for today. The statement concludes that "newborn circumcision has 
potential medical benefits and advantages, as well as disadvantages and risks." 
</P>
<P>
It counsels pediatricians to explain benefits and risks fully to the parents of 
newborn boys, taking into account the medical implications of circumcision as 
well as issues of "aesthetics, religion, cultural attitudes, social pressures 
and tradition." Since the medical perception of circumcision is scientifically 
neutral, the pediatrics academy concludes, parents should be encouraged to make 
their own personal decisions on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
Circumcision, the cutting away of the foreskin of the penis, is usually 
performed within a few weeks of birth, when complications are rare and deaths 
almost never occur. Circumcision of adult men is a far more serious surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The statement is the final report of a task force created by the academy in 
January of last year to reexamine the procedure in view of recent studies that 
have attributed significant health benefits to circumcision, which has been in 
declining use since the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The advantages of circumcision in newborns, the new report found, include 
prevention of urinary tract infections in infancy, cancer of the penis in adult 
men and inhibition of a variety of sexually transmitted diseases. The academy 
concluded that circumcision may also influence the rate of cervical cancer in 
women, which was found to be lower in the sexual partners of circumcised men. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AIDS Connection Denied 
</P>
<P>
But the pediatrics academy dismissed as unconvincing other studies that have 
linked circumcision to preventing spread of the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Milos, executive director of the National Organization of Circumcision 
Information Resource Centers (NOCIRC), called the new position "disappointing." 
Even though the academy's position paper pointedly ignored the AIDS issue, 
Milos contended that "our fear is that, as has happened at other times with the 
AIDS scare, and the concern over urinary tract infections, the media will blow 
out of proportion what the academy is saying." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Paul Fleiss, a Los Angeles pediatrician who is on NOCIRC's professional 
advisory board, said the new statement is a significant departure from the 
pediatrics academy's previous position, which has been in force since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
"This new statement sort of vacillates," he said, "characterizing it as "an 
unfortunate decision because (the policy) should remain that there are no 
medical indications for circumcision." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James Strain, the Pediatrics Academy's executive director, said the new 
neutral position may only be temporary. He said that if future studies -- 
which, he said, have not yet been organized -- confirm that circumcision 
prevents large numbers of urinary tract infections in newborns, the academy 
will probably change the policy to one of unequivocal endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Strain said he expected circumcision opponents to criticize the report, which 
has been awaited for months and has been the object of intense speculation 
among physicians. "I think we will be criticized by organizations that are 
opposed to circumcision and see no value in it and talk about it in terms of 
mutilation of the foreskin," he said. "We try to deal with it in a purely 
scientific way." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said it 
was reviewing its own position on circumcision and may officially endorse the 
new statement by the pediatricians. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has a higher rate of newborn circumcision than any other 
Western country, according to anti-circumcision groups. But in recent years, 
even the American rate has fallen dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
NOCIRC claims that, in 1987, 58.6% of American newborn baby boys were 
circumcised. The rate in the mid-1960s was as high as 85%, said the group. 
</P>
<P>
Strain predicted that the new statement will either bring a halt to the slow 
reduction in the nation's circumcision rate or cause a slight increase. "I 
think there are going to be parents who continue to be very concerned about 
it," Strain said, noting that many families express concerns about pain 
inflicted by newborn circumcision. The new policy statement urges physicians to 
use carefully determined anesthetic doses to minimize babies' discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
The academy noted that, although anti-circumcision groups have contended that 
complication and death rates are unacceptably high and outweigh any benefits of 
circumcision, documentation for that could not be found. The few data that do 
exist, the statement said, could identify not a single death in two series of 
675,000 cases reviewed. Other records, the academy said, found only three U.S. 
deaths from circumcision in the last 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Strain said that, in view of the new data and the Academy's position, "I would 
say I probably would have my own child circumcised."

PUTTING A LID ON LOUD MUSIC?;

<P>
NOISE-CONTROL LAWS MAY VARY FROM SITE TO SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was just last week that the U.S. Supreme Court heard lawyers argue whether 
the law allows those who would like some peace and quiet to put a sonic damper 
on a rock concert bent on reaching high-decibel nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County Superior Court, such matters have been filling ever-growing 
volumes of legal files for more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, the Pacific Amphitheatre and a group of its Costa Mesa neighbors 
have been fighting in court over the point when a boisterous outdoor concert 
stops being fun and becomes a public nuisance. The Supreme Court case, which 
involves New York City's attempt to enforce noise limits at a Central Park 
concert band shell, apparently won't have any immediate bearing on the Pacific 
Amphitheatre case. 
</P>
<P>
Richard L. Spix, attorney for Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa, the group that 
has sued amphitheater management to tone down concert volume, took some heart 
from New York's ability to get the Supreme Court to consider the concert noise 
issue. But Spix said a different set of ground rules govern the Costa Mesa 
suit, because no noise-control law similar to the New York City regulation is 
in effect. Neil Papiano, attorney for Ned West Inc., the arm of the Nederlander 
Organization that runs the Pacific Amphitheatre, said Wednesday that he wasn't 
familiar with the Supreme Court case. 
</P>
<P>
In the New York case, the city tried to take the control of the volume knobs 
out of performers' hands and put a city-supplied technician in charge, while 
also requiring that a city-supplied sound system be used. A federal appellate 
court ruled that the restrictions deprived performers of their constitutional 
right of free expression, prompting the city to appeal the case to the Supreme 
Court. New York City's attorney in the case, Leonard J. Koerner, said Thursday 
that a ruling isn't expected before the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
Spix said the Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa isn't pressing to take the 
control out of Pacific Amphitheatre management's hands. Its aim is to have the 
managers of the 18,700-capacity amphitheater take initiatives of their own to 
put a lid on sound levels the neighbors maintain are excessive. 
</P>
<P>
Each side contends the other's measurement of sound levels in the neighborhood 
is flawed, and Papiano denies that the limits set by a county noise ordinance 
have ever been broken. Pacific Amphitheatre officials have been adamant about 
not restricting performers' sound output: locked in hot competition with 
another major Orange County outdoor venue, the 15,000-capacity Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre, any such restriction could put the Pacific at a disadvantage in 
attracting top acts that want to let the decibels fly unfettered. 
</P>
<P>
In a new gambit that amphitheater officials hope will reduce noise outside the 
amphitheater without attenuating the sound power on which some rock bands and 
audiences thrive, Papiano said a new sound system is being installed for the 
1989 season at a cost of $250,000. The system is designed to focus sound inside 
the amphitheater instead of projecting it over an earthen barrier and into 
residential areas. It will involve suspending speakers in an arc above the 
stage, instead of mounting them in columns on the sides as in the past, Papiano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The first big test will come April 8, when the heavy-metal act Poison plays the 
Pacific, after the April 7 season opener by country band Alabama. Orange County 
Superior Court Judge Richard J. Beacom has set an April 14 conference with 
lawyers to review the new system's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the system will do," Papiano said. "We hope it will take 
care of all problems in all directions." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, outdoor concert noise has been a problem, but not an unsolvable 
one. 
</P>
<P>
In response to neighbors' noise complaints, the Universal Amphitheatre was 
converted from an open-air venue to an enclosed theater in 1982. Noise 
complaints also plagued the Greek Theatre until 1986, when its operator, the 
Nederlander Organization, agreed to sound restraints that appear to have worked 
for the city-owned facility. 
</P>
<P>
"The Greek for the past two years has had no complaints by the citizens, none 
whatsoever," said Officer Chuck Massar, coordinator of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's noise-enforcement team. The key, he said, was installing a 
"limiter" device on the amphitheater's sound control board, thereby 
automatically capping its sound output at levels tolerable on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from one loud, late-running 1987 show by the rock band U2, the Los 
Angeles Coliseum has been free from noise complaints in recent years, Massar 
said. The Hollywood Bowl and the John Anson Ford Theatre also have not 
generated neighborhood complaints, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Bowl and the Ford Theatre did come into disharmony with one 
another last year when Philharmonic concert-goers at the Bowl complained that 
rock bands at the smaller theater across the freeway were drowning out the 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"We canceled about 10 concerts to suit the Bowl," said Ward Hassett, assistant 
manager of the private company that runs the county-owned Ford Theatre. "As it 
sits right now, we're not allowed to (have concerts) on the same night as the 
Hollywood Bowl when the Philharmonic is in session. We're in negotiations with 
the Philharmonic and the county, trying to devise some kind of solution" that 
would allow simultaneous shows at both locations. One possibility, he said, 
could be the installation of a sound-reducing roof over part of the Ford 
Theatre.

'ROAD TO MECCA' A PERSONAL JOURNEY

<P>
Most of the time, the deeply personal play burbles out of a playwright's 
consciousness at the start of a career. In "The Road to Mecca," South Africa's 
Athol Fugard breaks with that erratic tradition by offering his most personal 
drama well along in his playwriting years. 
</P>
<P>
This chamber piece for three voices, which opened Saturday at the Old Globe's 
Cassius Carter Centre Stage, holds a few other surprises, not all of them good. 
It's his talkiest play, his most densely and overtly symbolic, and it sets 
aside anti-apartheid themes in favor of frontal attacks on a more general 
Afrikaner malady: the paternalistic hypocrisy that cloaks its inherent 
destructiveness in a self-ennobling mantle of rectitude. 
</P>
<P>
The protagonists here are all white and focused on an aging artist caught in 
the crossfire between the rebellious young teacher who befriends her and the 
protective pastor of her church. 
</P>
<P>
The widowed Miss Helen (Erica Rogers) lives alone in New Bethesda, a hermetic 
and isolated community in the vast semi-desert of South Africa's Karoo. She's 
in her 80s and has been given to creating exotic sculptures in her house and 
garden ever since her husband died many years before. In the rigidly conformist 
Afrikaner society around her, this has set her apart as a slightly batty 
eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Miss Helen has been finding it harder to cope with daily living. Her 
friend and pastor, Marius Byleveld (Ralph Waite), wants her to move into the 
safe environment of a retirement home. If she wants to, of course. For her own 
good, of course. It would mean leaving her strange, exotic statues and other 
creations -- the fruit of her "hobby" as Marius calls it, which, in another day 
and time, he points out, "might have been idolatry." 
</P>
<P>
But Miss Helen's other friend, Elsa (Lynne Griffin), a radical young teacher 
from Cape Town, 800 miles away, knows that these statues are "her expressions 
of freedom" and that such a move away would be a sentence of death. 
</P>
<P>
The many symbols of the "Road to Mecca" (starting with the title) lie in this 
struggle among the death-defying forces of individualism and self-realization 
(Miss Helen), its defenders (Elsa) and the self-righteous conformists who 
oppose it (Marius). 
</P>
<P>
This symbolism is neatly geometric, elaborately debated and made clear to the 
point of becoming simplistic. Act One is spent setting up the premise and the 
problem (what to do with Miss Helen), Act Two is spent working it out. 
</P>
<P>
What started out as a seductive layering of ideas ends up being talked to 
death, sometimes with a high level of passion (as in Elsa's ardent defense of 
her friend's artistic freedom or Miss Helen's ultimate self-defense), but also 
always with a high degree of textual and subtextual predictability. 
</P>
<P>
We know quickly that the three symbolize not only this artist but this country 
-- this South Africa torn apart by conflicts between freedom and suppression; 
that the Karoo represents emotional as well as factual drought. Such 
overstatement, in the end, defuses the play. The lines are clever but too 
calculated, too reasoned, too over-explained, sapping the possibility of 
excitement out of the piece. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Noel's staging at the Carter falls victim to the over-symbolism and fails 
to generate any serious excitement of its own (except for the inventive, Watts 
Towersish designs by Joel Fontaine and Barth Ballard's lights). 
</P>
<P>
Noel did not make his task any easier when he cast Rogers as Miss Helen, an 
actress who is South African by birth and who has worked with Fugard, but who 
is also too young and plays age only fitfully. The gray wig, make-up and 
old-lady clothes alone don't cut it, even if the accent does. 
</P>
<P>
Both Waite and Griffin, on the other hand, seem to have decided to play their 
parts minus (or almost minus) an accent and Waite appeared uncommonly subdued 
as Marius opening night. Griffin comes up with the requisite level of anger and 
effrontery for Elsa, but she's swimming alone and upstream. Matters may improve 
and performances coalesce in the running, but for the moment this "Road to 
Mecca" is a rocky one. 
</P>

Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m.; matinees Saturdays and Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends

PREVIN LEADS A POIGNANT MAHLER FOURTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regardless of what you may have read in these pages, don't underestimate Andre 
Previn. Not yet. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional wisdom -- the noun, admittedly, is dubious -- has long insisted 
that he can't do much with the traditional Germanic repertory. He is too 
objective. 
</P>
<P>
Let him conduct Elgar or Ravel, and he shines. Give him Beethoven or Brahms, 
and he gets perfunctory. 
</P>
<P>
This, we thought, was a simple matter of proclivity and priority. Call it 
type-casting. Since Previn happens to be music director of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic, it also was a cause for ongoing concern. 
</P>
<P>
The first half of the concert Friday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion 
confirmed negative expectations. In Richard Strauss' "Don Juan," Previn seemed 
embarrassed by the heroic Romantic rhetoric. Interpretatively uptight, or 
possibly just plain bored, he concentrated on speed and clarity. He also 
allowed the orchestra to play sloppily. 
</P>
<P>
This boded bad for the second half of the program, which was devoted to the 
Mahler Fourth Symphony. But -- happy surprise -- the sprawling, expansive, 
sentimental, sometimes charming, sometimes grotesque, sometimes ethereal, often 
grandiose challenge brought out the best in him. In turn, it brought out the 
best in his players. 
</P>
<P>
Previn obviously had given Mahler a lot of thought. He took chances on 
exceptionally slow tempos. He searched for illuminating details -- insistent 
inner voices, subtle tempo shifts, unpredictable stresses. 
</P>
<P>
For all its flexibility, the performance sometimes came close to being 
ponderous. It seldom came too close. 
</P>
<P>
Previn respected the redeeming values of expressive tension and dynamic 
intimacy. He dared offer an original reading. It was lovely, indulgent and 
ultimately poignant. 
</P>
<P>
The soprano for the innocent bucolic verses of the last movement turned out to 
be a luxurious choice: Kathleen Battle. When audible -- a prospect that became 
increasingly dubious as the vocal line descended -- her soprano sounded 
characteristically sweet and pure. 
</P>
<P>
She had not been as persuasive earlier in the program, however, in four popular 
Lieder of Richard Strauss. Three of the languid selections, not incidentally, 
were holdovers from the recital she gave at UCLA only last month. 
</P>
<P>
One applauded her taste and refinement, as always. One admired her poise and 
her precious array of silver-bell tones. Still, an ingrate -- this ingrate -- 
wished she would do a little more singing, a little less sighing and 
whispering.

STYLISH 'DON PASQUALE' IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For some blissfully unaccustomed, patently coincidental reason, this has been 
bel-canto season in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The Music Center recently exhumed Rossini's "Tancredi," while Opera Pacific 
offered Bellini's "Norma" as a prelude to Rossini's "Barbiere." San Diego began 
a Donizetti mini-survey with the pretty madness of "Lucia" and, for a sprightly 
encore, turned Saturday night to "Don Pasquale." 
</P>
<P>
All this in an area that suffered just a couple of years ago from chronic 
operatic deprivation. There may be hope. 
</P>
<P>
After San Diego's disastrous effort last month to transform Beethoven's 
"Fidelio" into a relevant political farce, one approached the Civic Theatre 
with some trepidation. Would "Don Pasquale" take place in the Persian Gulf? 
Would the crusty Roman septuagenarian resemble a womanizing cabinet nominee or 
inhabit a space ship? Would the ancient formula intrigues be fraught with 
neo-socio-symbolic meanings? 
</P>
<P>
The answers turned out to be negative. Relief. 
</P>
<P>
This, essentially, was the 19th-Century opera buffa we know and love. It 
required, and received, no aesthetic rethinking, no temporal updating, no 
theatrical embellishing. 
</P>
<P>
Using the charming storybook decors designed by John Conklin for the San 
Francisco Opera, Wolfgang Weber was content to stage the comedy of mannerisms 
as a reasonably witty period piece. Even when the humor tended toward the 
ponderous, his action scheme remained picturesque and stylish. 
</P>
<P>
Weber's ideas -- even the sporadic dubious ones -- were deftly executed by a 
handsome, resourceful, generally youthful ensemble. For better or worse -- 
mostly better -- this was a team effort unjarred by star turns. 
</P>
<P>
As the classically duped, generously forgiving protagonist, Francois Loup 
resisted the usual comic cliches. He discovered a welcome trace of pathos 
behind the old man's grouchy facade, and sang quite beautifully. One wanted to 
forgive his proclivity for mugging and to forget his weakness for 
scene-stealing. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Parrish sang the first Norina of her fast-rising career. She chirped 
with reasonable bravura, a fuzzy trill notwithstanding, and commanded the stage 
with easy bravado. She also dampened delight somewhat by reducing the quixotic, 
essentially sympathetic heroine to one very tough cookie. 
</P>
<P>
Mark DuBois as the ardent Ernesto sounded voice-sick, not just love-sick. 
Although no apologies were offered on his behalf, his tastefully employed 
tenorino all but strangled in the stratosphere. One would like to blame his 
problems on physical indisposition rather than technical indiscretion. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Ledbetter of the San Francisco Opera Center revealed a flair for the 
debonair and correspondingly elegant vocalism as Malatesta, the 
quintessentially wily baritone. Remember his name. 
</P>
<P>
The chorus of motley servants, trained by Martin Wright, looked unusually 
animated and sounded exceptionally mellifluous. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone in the cast seemed willing and able to shape Donizetti's graceful, 
grateful cantilena with expressive freedom. Any such effort was doomed, 
unfortunately, by Karen Keltner, who conducted with unyielding, mechanical 
brio. At least she kept the articulation crisp and the textures light.

A story in the German magazine Opernglas reports that tenor Placido Domingo 
will take a long-deferred plunge into the Wagnerian waters of "Tristan" the 
season after next. According to the magazine, the emphatically non-German 
tenor, who also dabbles in conducting and harbors ambitions to run an opera 
company of his own, will sing the unaccustomed title role under the auspices of 
the Los Angeles Music Center Opera. (A spokesman for the opera company here 
said the project has been under discussion but there are no definite plans or 
dates at this point.) Domingo's Isolde would also be a newcomer to this 
treacherous challenge: Eva Marton, who just received mixed notices as the 
sleazy heroine of the updated "Salome" at the Metropolitan Opera. ALEENE

Without switching personalities, format or any of the other essentials that 
normally go with such things, KMPC-FM (101.9) will cease to exist today and 
reemerge as KEDG-FM. "Nothing will change except for the advertising and 
promotion," says Denise Maynard, programming assistant for "The Edge" (as the 
station now calls itself). She said the call letter change came about because 
station management believed listeners confused KMPC-FM, an album rock format, 
with its AM sister station which programs big band and easy listening music 
along with the California Angels baseball games. ALEENE MacMINN and SHAUNA SNOW

Four people in Angers, France, have been given short, suspended sentences and 
fines of $7,500 each for attacking a theater showing "The Last Temptation of 
Christ." They were convicted of throwing tear gas bombs and pouring acid on 
seats last fall at a movie theater in Angers, which is about 180 miles 
southwest of Paris. Theaters throughout France were attacked during showings of 
director Martin Scorsese's film, and French fundamentalist Roman Catholics 
condemned the movie as sacrilegious and disrespectful in its depiction of Jesus 
Christ. ALEENE MacMINN and SHAUNA SNOW

TAPE OF GARVEY'S EX: WAS IT A SCOOP OR A SNOOP? 
</P>

<P>
KFMB-TV(Channel 8) reporter Lorraine Kimel was on Channel 8's "Sun Up San 
Diego" Friday morning talking about her exclusive interview with Rebecka 
Mendenhall, Steve Garvey's ex-fiancee. Kimel's phone interview was unique, the 
only time Mendenhall's voice has been heard since the story of Garvey's 
complicated love life broke two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
However, the interview was not supposed to happen. Mendenhall, who last week 
filed a paternity suit against Garvey, says her brief conversation with Kimel 
was recorded and aired without her permission or knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Reached in Atlanta on Friday, Mendenhall, an assignment editor with CNN, said 
she is "disturbed" by Kimel's taping of the brief interview and that she has 
contacted her attorneys about it. Although she has talked to several reporters 
and issued short statements, she purposely has avoided giving radio or 
television interviews, even to her own network. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think it is an inappropriate way to deal with the situation," 
Mendenhall said. "I think it is a private matter." 
</P>
<P>
The interview Kimel aired Feb. 23 was brief and contained little information 
beyond what Mendenhall had already told reporters. When Kimel called, 
Mendenhall says she told her to contact her attorney. Kimel persisted, asking 
vague, conversational questions about Mendenhall's health. 
</P>
<P>
After she hung up the phone, Mendenhall says it occurred to her that Kimel 
might have taped the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"The tone of her questions and the way she was aggressively pursuing a sound 
bite made me suspicious," Mendenhall said. 
</P>
<P>
Kimel denies covertly taping the interview. She says she first contacted 
Mendenhall to request an interview in the morning. Mendenhall told her to call 
back in an hour, so she could have time to call her attorney. Kimel 
acknowledges that when she called back, Mendenhall said she did not want to be 
interviewed and referred questions to her attorney. 
</P>
<P>
However, Kimel says she specifically told Mendenhall to pause before answering 
questions because she was using a "clicker" phone with an audio switch, the 
type of phone commonly used for television phone interviews, in order to tape 
the interview. Mendenhall says Kimel never mentioned anything about recording 
the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was established when I called at 10 a.m. (the first call) that I was 
calling for an interview," Kimel said. "She never said, 'Don't tape this.' It 
was clear I was phoning for an interview. Someone in the business, especially 
in the television end, would know how it works." 
</P>
<P>
Channel 8 News Director Jim Holtzman said the original tape of the interview 
had been routinely recycled and was not available for review. 
</P>
<P>
"It is certainly our policy here to tell people they're being recorded," 
Holtzman said. 
</P>
<P>
Laws concerning the taping of phone conversations differ from state to state. 
</P>
<P>
"In California, if it is a confidential communication, all parties must give 
their consent to the taping," said Terry Francke, legal counsel for the 
California Newspaper Publishers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
However, the definition of a confidential conversation has never been addressed 
by the courts in the context of a journalistic inquiry, Francke said. Within 
the industry, though, it is considered extremely unethical to tape a 
conversation without a person's consent. 
</P>
<P>
Mendenhall said Kimel's actions were "unfair." Deluged by calls from reporters, 
Mendenhall changed her phone number shortly after Kimel's call and has 
generally refused to discuss the case with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"I have talked to people from other television stations, people like Susan 
Farrell (KNSD-TV, Channel 39), and they've been very nice, very polite and I 
understand they're just doing their jobs," Mendenhall said. "They never 
recorded me. They respected my desire for privacy." 
</P>
<P>
Are Geraldo Rivera and Cheech Marin (of Cheech and Chong fame) going to be the 
new owners of KNSD-TV (Channel 39)? The king of trash television talked about 
his plans to buy television stations with a group of investors, which includes 
Marin, for an article that ran in The Times on Sunday. Rivera talked in-depth 
about a trip he recently made on George Gillett's private plane, talking 
business and relishing the pleasures of corporate schmoozing. Gillett, of 
course, owns Channel 39 and other stations, which he has been rumored to be 
looking to sell. 
</P>
<P>
The highly praised restored version of "Gone With the Wind" makes its San Diego 
debut at the Ken Theater on Sunday for a weeklong run. Reaction to the film has 
been so strong throughout the country that Landmark Theaters is planning to 
move the film to the Park Theater for an indefinite run, beginning March 19. . 
. . The La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art's retrospective of Roman Polanski's 
work continues on Wednesday with a 7:30 p.m. screening of "Repulsion," the 1965 
thriller starring Catherine Deneuve. 
</P>
<P>
A local writer sent a copy of San Diego Magazine to relatives in Saudi Arabia. 
When it arrived, all the plastic surgery ads, bikini shots and anything 
remotely suggestive had been cut from the magazine by government censors, who 
obviously have not yet seen a copy of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Miller will be assuming anchor duties for Channel 8's main 5 p.m. newscast 
in April. Greg Hurst will be moving to the 6:30 p.m. edition. Longtime anchor 
Allison Ross is generally believed to be on her way out when her contract ends 
in June, but news director Holtzman said no decision had been made about Ross' 
future with the station. 
</P>
<P>
KGTV (Channel 10) is planning a Barbara Walters-like interview show to air 
after the Oscar ceremony and a Walters show on March 29. Scheduled guests 
include Mayor Maureen O'Connor, Ernest Hahn and Steve Garvey, who committed to 
tape the show before his paternity suit troubles were aired. The Garv, ever 
Garv-like, honored his commitment and taped the interview last week along with 
his new wife, although he reportedly is refusing new requests for interviews.

COMPOSER / CONDUCTOR LUKAS FOSS VISITS UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps it was Lukas Foss' smooth personality and excellent communicative 
skills that made the weaker moments of his latest Los Angeles appearance, 
Friday night in Schoenberg Hall at UCLA, less noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, lack of rehearsal -- for which Foss repeatedly apologized from the 
stage -- contributed to intonation and interpretive problems while he conducted 
a 36-member student chamber ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there were triumphant moments. Foss conducted William Kraft's 
Expressionist "Double Play" (1982) for violin, piano and chamber orchestra, 
with a powerful sense of drama and overflowing rapture. Violinist Yukiko Kamei 
confidently delivered a stunning solo part while pianist Tad White offered a 
careful reading that blended tastefully. 
</P>
<P>
In another high point, cellist Lynn Harrell mastered Foss' Neo-classic 
"Capriccio" (1948) with superb virtuosity, humorously hamming it up -- in 
direct contrast to the more ponderous Foss on piano. Also by Foss, the eclectic 
"Curriculum Vitae" (1977) for solo accordion provided a good vehicle for the 
meticulous artistry of Yvonne Schnebly. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the fare proved routine and, in some cases, not worth mentioning. 
The first concert performance of Roy Travis' 1975 orchestration of his "Songs 
and Epilogues" (1965) promised much but conveyed only fleeting moments of the 
needed passion. Bass Heinz Blankenburg offered deep, rich tone, but little 
expressivity in the highly emotional texts by Sappho.GREGG WAGER

GLORIA NEWMAN TROUPE IN SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For more than a quarter century, Orange County's Gloria Newman has been an 
important force in modern dance in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
But in what has become a distressing trend, Newman has had to take her troupe 
-- the Gloria Newman Dance Theater -- out of the county to make one of its 
comparatively infrequent appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, the company ventured to Santa Monica College to dance 
Newman's "Cantata II." 
</P>
<P>
Because it was presented essentially as a work in progress, any description and 
judgment about "Cantata II," seen Friday, must be considered tentative. 
</P>
<P>
There could be little question, however, about the technical strength and 
accomplishments of the nine dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Cantilevered balances and X-beam extensions could be rock-steady. The dancers 
breezed through punishing footwork, executed isolations with power and attacked 
movements with vigor. 
</P>
<P>
While almost everyone had virtuosic opportunities, Karol Lee finished the last 
of three sections in a blaze of particularly striking balances and turns. 
</P>
<P>
As in "Cantata, Part I" (created in 1987), Newman's dancers recounted incidents 
from their lives at the same time they were executing these difficult 
maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
Karen J. Woo told about her Chinese mother working in a tortilla factory and 
feeling that she herself was "half Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
Puerto Rican Victor Robles recalled his mother refusing to learn to speak 
English and asking her children to read her her letters. 
</P>
<P>
The reminiscences tended to emphasize death, disease, divorce. Yet these 
important, personal subjects were recounted in the same affectless tone as were 
memories of pets and high school nicknames. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, dancers are not actors, or at least these dancers, for all their 
fine movement qualities, are not actors. But even though they derived the 
stories mostly from their own autobiographies (there have been, apparently, 
some changes in personnel), they failed to project emotional connection. 
</P>
<P>
At this stage of its development, then, "Cantata II" presented an unsatisfying 
profile -- a highly personal work that failed to make a personal impact. CHRIS

YOAV TALMI CONDUCTS L.A. CHAMBER ORCHESTRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Giving a nod to new music and tipping its hat at an old Art Deco theater, the 
Wiltern, the peripatetic Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra hit on an appealing mix 
Friday -- thanks largely to its guests, conductor Yoav Talmi and violinist 
Frank Peter Zimmermann. 
</P>
<P>
A West Coast premiere, Michael Gandolfi's "Point of Departure" turned out to be 
an ambitious, intricately wrought work that moves cunningly from agitated to 
lyric to mournful states, one that filters its various motifs and materials 
through a high-definition structure of extraordinary polish. Talmi and the 
orchestra seized the opportunity, answering its challenges to refinement and 
clarity. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed, in fact, a deliberate continuation of musical thought when the 
ensemble, with Zimmermann, next launched into Prokofiev's First Concerto -- for 
here was an echo of winds chirping over high tremolo strings, sounding the same 
aerial tension of Gandolfi's piece. The soloist, a1847616888th the placid 
shimmer of the music. Adding Ravel's dark and throaty "Tzigane" merely broke 
themood. 
</P>
<P>
But Talmi redefined it, along with Beethoven's First Symphony, to which he 
brought equal parts gracious warmth and driving exuberance. DONNA PERLMUTTER

BIG FLOOD COMPANY AT MAIN ST. DANCE STUDIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Watching different dancers alternate in major roles may be the greatest 
constant pleasure of ballet-going but is still comparatively rare in modern 
dance. Now, however, Ferne Ackerman's locally based Big Flood Dance Company 
offers two performances per program of the same short work -- with a switch of 
principals -- in its intriguing new Saturday series at the Main Street Dance 
Studio in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
As Ackerman explained in one of the question-and-answer sessions, she wanted to 
see how the size, weight and personality of her choreography would change when 
new people came into it. More significantly for the work danced on this 
occasion, Ackerman also wanted to learn how an audience's experience would 
differ in an immediate second viewing. 
</P>
<P>
On this evening, Big Flood danced and re-danced "Flame," a formal 1986 group 
piece that will be seen in July on the "Dance Kaleidoscope" series at Cal State 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Set to a high energy, percussive sound-score, "Flame" found the six cast 
members wearing long robes: black on the outside and brightly colored on the 
inside to match their loose sweat shirts and leotards. These robes became 
full-scale entities in the performance . 
</P>
<P>
However, Ackerman's ingenuity with robes tended to cloak other major values in 
the work: her rhythmic sophistication, for example, or the deft contrasts 
between sensuous, flowing torso motion and quick, sharp limb action. 
</P>
<P>
It was these elements that emerged in high relief at the repeat performance -- 
not so much from the substitution of two dancers as from audience familiarity 
with the piece itself. As the novelty wore off, the artistry became more 
evident. Perhaps Big Flood should have danced "Flame" a third time -- with no 
robes at all. LEWIS SEGAL

POP CAPSULES : VISITING VETERANS JOIN HARMONICA BLOWDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The third annual Harmonica Blowdown wasn't quite the night of the endless 
shuffle, but there were enough up-tempo blues at the six-hour performance to 
satiate the capacity crowd at the Music Machine on Saturday night. The 
blowdown, a benefit for the family of the late George (Harmonica) Smith, paired 
hometown stalwarts William Clarke and James Harman with two veterans making 
their local debuts. 
</P>
<P>
Lazy Lester helped fashion the swamp-blues sound associated with Lightning Slim 
and Slim Harpo on the Excello label during the '50s and '60s. The lanky 
Louisiana man (who plays the Palomino on Friday) blended his deep voice and 
agile instrumental work on a nicely-paced assortment of bayou boogies and 
grinding swamp blues. 
</P>
<P>
George (Mojo) Buford, resplendent in a black leather outfit and 
harmonica-studded bandolier, earned his stripes playing with Muddy Waters -- as 
you might have guessed from his repertoire of Chicago blues standards. But only 
brief sections of Little Walter's "Blues With a Feeling" and Waters' "Got My 
Mojo Workin' " struck sparks. 
</P>
<P>
Sandwiched between those per formances, Clarke's quintet delivered an hour of 
sprightly shuffles, even rousing that portion of the audience that inexplicably 
spent the first half of the evening sitting on the dance floor. DON SNOWDEN

POP CAPSULES : VAUGHN: POP CLASSICISM AND BORDERLINE CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not always easy to tell just how far Ben Vaughn has his tongue in his 
cheek when he plays his bare-bones pop-rock and sings rhymes of the "She won't 
look my way / My desire won't go away" variety. Probably not very far. This New 
Jerseyite's somewhat nostalgic grooves and borderline campy lyrics find their 
simplicity less out of irony -- though there's plenty of that -- than out of a 
real sense of pop classicism. 
</P>
<P>
Leading a rockin' trio he called the Ben Vaughn Desert Classic on Saturday at 
Club Lingerie, the singer revealed himself as much fan as artiste. "This is 
kind of a little beach-music vibe here," he said, providing a handy description 
of one new song. He prefaced another by saying it has "a Neil Diamond kind of 
groove." Just call him Ben, the critics' pal. 
</P>
<P>
But listen, Cherry baby, Vaughn -- a skinny, T-shirt-and-jeans kind of guy -- 
is much funnier than Diamond even, and sounds more like Lou Reed (without the 
surliness) or Jonathan Richman (before he latched onto dinosaurs and babies). 
What's certain is that after three LPs he still hasn't been "discovered" yet, 
but with I-can-identify songs like "She's Your Problem Now," there isn't any 
compelling reason why Vaughn's wry tongue shouldn't be chic. CHRIS WILLMAN

THE 'HIT LIST' MOB KILLS IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ads for "Hit List" (selected theaters) promise a Geraldo Rivera-style expose 
that will put an end to the "lie" that "there is no Mob. . . . The truth will 
shock you!" 
</P>
<P>
The shocking truth in this slambang actioner turns out to be that there is 
indeed a Mafia full of strongly accented Italians who pull hits in pizza 
parlors, pay off cops and are regularly dragged in to testify before grand 
juries -- hardly surprising, except that the metropolis this post-Sicilian 
Mafia purportedly runs roughshod over is Los Angeles. Now that is a shock! 
</P>
<P>
So maybe director William Lustig (of "Maniac" and "Maniac Cop" fame) couldn't 
afford to send his crew to Chicago or New York. All credibility aside -- and, 
believe us, this picture does put all credibility aside -- "Hit List" is a 
surprisingly efficient thriller where it counts, in the stunts and tension 
departments, with the added benefit of a few welcome quirks around its 
workmanlike edges. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble brews when an unhinged hit man (Lance Henriksen) is sent by the mob's 
loudmouth chieftain (Rip Torn) to rub out an associate (Leo Rossi) who's due to 
snitch. Uh-oh: Across the street from the intended victim, a slamming door 
inadvertently turns the 9 in a house number into a 6 -- shades of "The 'burbs" 
-- and the mob's man ends up kidnaping a boy at the wrong address. 
</P>
<P>
The worried father who takes off in gun-toting search of these two is 
Jan-Michael Vincent, doing his best (well, maybe not his best) to approximate 
the ticked-off stoicism of a Bronson or an Eastwood. If he ends up being a big 
blank at the movie's poorly scripted heroic center, Vincent is surrounded on 
all sides by scenery-chewers -- especially Rip Torn, who seems determined to 
take the hammiest possible route to any line-reading. 
</P>
<P>
The script for "Hit List" (MPAA-rated R) is wildly scattershot, but writers 
John Goff and Peter Brosnan have come up with their fair share of witticisms 
amid the senselessness. (We learn that the kidnaper is "so twisted, when he 
dies, you'll have to screw him in the ground.") Lustig's direction is likewise 
hit-and-miss -- he's hardly what you'd call an actor's director yet -- but he 
does keep things bustling all the way to the parking-garage climax, where 
somebody finally learns a lesson about those no-exit ramp spikes the hard way.

WRITERS' SEMINAR DECRIES THE SLOW RISE OF MINORITIES IN HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 35 aspiring minority screenwriters, directors and producers -- some 
claiming that racism is rampant in the film business -- attended their own kind 
of pep rally this weekend. Frustrations were vented, gripes were made, 
complaints were lodged, but the session was short on solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Spawned by Writers Guild of America findings that minorities make up only 2% of 
employed WGA members, Saturday's American Film Institute Alumni Assn. Writers 
Workshop seminar in Culver City focused on financing minority-themed projects 
-- projects that panel members agreed are severely lacking. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very hard for black directors and . . . black writers," said Dale 
Pollock, vice president of production for A&amp;M Films, addressing the 
predominantly black audience on what he termed the "institutional racism of 
Hollywood." "When you're dealing with studios on a minority project, you're 
dealing with their preconceptions and it can be very difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"A film can appeal to two audiences (both black and white) simultaneously -- 
but (a big studio) has problems assimilating that idea." 
</P>
<P>
Panel member Steven Fayne, an entertainment attorney representing the 
Completion Bond Co., which guarantees motion picture financing, also blamed 
Hollywood's large studios for the low number of minority films. 
</P>
<P>
"Studios have historically always been conservative . . . and that may be where 
you get into the racism," he said. "They're only going to do a certain number 
of films they consider as black oriented. . . . Studios are run by white men -- 
so women have trouble and minorities have trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Fayne continued: "Studios tend to view black writers as being acceptable (only) 
for black-themed films. So you've got to do some crossover work to convince 
them (otherwise)." 
</P>
<P>
The seminar's three minority speakers never outwardly referred to industry 
conditions as a product of "racism" as did Pollock and Fayne. The three 
stressed working within the system to prove individual worth. 
</P>
<P>
"We may have to live with the system -- it won't change overnight," said 
independent producer Carol Akiyama, a former senior vice president of the 
Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. "We have to work within 
the system to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Akiyama advised versatility -- such as writing for TV as well as feature films 
-- and maintaining faith and passion in one's work, but admitted, "There aren't 
as many minority writers out there as there should be." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Greene, who as vice president of creative affairs at Columbia Pictures 
is one of the industry's few black executives, took the same line, saying: 
"It's very easy to focus on what should be, but you've got to put your energy 
into what is and work with it." 
</P>
<P>
Greene suggested taking inspiration from blacks who have brought about change 
in various fields, and stressed the importance of networking with other 
minorities in the entertainment community. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a minority, you've got to think, 'Who else is there that I might 
have access to?' " Greene said. As an example, Greene, a former member of the 
group Sha Na Na, suggested involving in projects black musicians who have 
bankable names as well as connections. 
</P>
<P>
Panel member Bill Duke, who has directed nearly 100 movies, episodic shows and 
pilots for TV, was the most upbeat of the panel members, stressing that 
although "it ain't easy," it's taking positive action, and not just talking 
about the minority problem, that will bring results. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people that have been in rougher spots than this and have done 
things," Duke said. "What we have to do is forget our differences and come 
together and combine to make it happen. If (a script or idea) is not being 
bought, then create the factors that will make it happen. It's up to us." 
</P>
<P>
Duke, who called his field of industry expertise "guerrilla warfare" and said 
he had "scars inside and outside," acted in such films as "Car Wash" and 
"American Gigolo" before turning to directing. "I was big and black and I was 
bald so I was a tough guy -- definitely not a romantic lead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Duke said minority film makers should consider work outside the traditional 
film Establishment. He suggested that they should consider foreign deals, 
independent work and even making videotapes as opposed to actual films. "If you 
get tired of hearing 'No,' . . . (and) if there's technology that exists that 
allows you to do it yourself, do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for penetrating the business side of the industry, Greene stressed advanced 
education, knowledge and contacts. "It's important to have young (black) people 
working toward (getting in on the business side). A lot of times the minority 
students don't pursue (opportunities like internships)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, talent and skill will still make the difference, the panel members 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But for minorities, Duke said: "I think you have to be a little bit more 
prepared; you have to know a little bit more about what you're talking about. 
I'm not talking about what's fair, but what's out there."

ATTORNEY IN HIT-AND-RUN DEATH TRIAL WON'T SAY IF DEFENDANT WILL TESTIFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An emotional hit-and-run fatality trial begins its defense phase today in 
Orange County Superior Court in Westminster, and the major question is whether 
the young defendant will take the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
Danny David Ornelas, 19, of Huntington Park is charged with second-degree 
murder. His attorney, Ralph Bencangey, has told the jury that Ornelas was, 
indeed, the driver of the car that hit a 37-year-old Newport Beach mother on 
Sept. 1 as she stood with two of her children in an alley behind their Balboa 
Peninsula home. 
</P>
<P>
But Bencangey has said that he will try to prove this week that Ornelas had no 
intention of hitting the woman and that he should have been charged with 
vehicular manslaughter, not murder. Bencangey also will contend that an eerie 
videotape that shows the woman as she was run down does not prove murder and, 
in fact, shows that the victim put herself in danger by standing in the middle 
of the alley. 
</P>
<P>
But Bencangey would not say whether he would put the defendant on the stand, 
leaving him open to cross-examination by the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Bencangey said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Bencangey noted in his opening statement to the jury last week that a defendant 
is not required to testify or say anything during a trial -- that the burden of 
proof is on the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
And Bencangey emphasized that he does not think the videotape proves the 
prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
The tape was accidentally made by John Lozano, 18, of Huntington Park, a 
passenger in the fast-moving car being driven by Ornelas. Lozano testified last 
week that he and Ornelas had been drinking rum and malt liquor during their 
afternoon at the beach before the fatal incident. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a little intoxicated," Lozano testified. "I felt a little light-headed. 
. . . I was just looking for anything to film." 
</P>
<P>
But Lozano added, in his testimony, that he didn't intend to videotape the 
sequence in an alley behind East Ocean Boulevard on Balboa Peninsula. It was in 
that alley, at about 5 p.m. on Sept. 1, that the victim, Debbie Killelea, was 
struck by the fast-moving car driven by Ornelas. 
</P>
<P>
The brief, blurred videotape made by Lozano shows Killelea in the alley with 
her two sons, Michael, 10, and Joe, 6. The tape shows her moving near the 
center of the alley as her sons watch nearby. Then the tape shows Killelea 
putting her hands on her hips as she looks down the alley at the approaching 
car. 
</P>
<P>
The tape ends in a blur as the car struck and fatally injured Killelea. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Goethals ended the prosecution case on Thursday, 
showing of the tape to the seven-man, five-woman jury. Goethals said that 
earlier testimony by eyewitnesses proved that Ornelas deliberately aimed the 
car at Killelea after she made her hands-on-hips sign of disapproval in the 
alley. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney Bencangey disagreed. He said the evidence shows that 
Ornelas swerved the car in a vain attempt to avoid Killelea after she had 
walked to the center of the alley. 
</P>
<P>
Bencangey said the testimony of Tim Jessup, a 20-year-old USC student who was 
walking in the alley that day and saw the incident, proves the defense's 
contention that Ornelas was trying to avoid hitting Killelea. 
</P>
<P>
Jessup, in his testimony, said he saw Killelea move toward the center of the 
alley as the car approached her. Under cross-examination by Bencangey, Jessup 
conceded that the woman "was more in the path" of the oncoming car after she 
moved toward the center of the alley. 
</P>
<P>
Jessup said he saw the car make "an abrupt turn" as it approached the woman. 
Goethals contended that Ornelas made this "abrupt turn" deliberately -- that 
Ornelas was intent on running the woman down as she tried to flee. 
</P>
<P>
But Bencangey said Jessup's testimony instead showed that Ornelas turned to the 
right to avoid hitting the woman and that she inadvertently ran back in front 
of the car. 
</P>
<P>
A Killelea neighbor, Gayle Orchard, testified last week that Ornelas climbed 
out of the overturned car after the collision, looked at the dying woman in the 
alley, and uttered a curse. 
</P>
<P>
"He frightened me," Orchard said. "I'll never forget it." 
</P>
<P>
But Bencangey has said that Ornelas is a "nice kid who wouldn't hurt a fly." 
</P>
<P>
Whether the defense attorney will allow Ornelas to make his own impression on 
the jury is, in the words of Bencangey, something "that remains to be seen."

And now: the video report card. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to keep parents better-informed about the academic progress of 
their offspring, San Diego State journalism professor Don Sneed sent home 
videotapes assessing the work and work habits of each student in his fall class 
on critical and editorial writing. 
</P>
<P>
Sneed decided that the regular report card carrying only a letter grade is too 
skimpy and only increases the alienation felt by tuition-paying parents. "In 
college there is no such thing as a teacher-parent conference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen of 20 students in Sneed's Journalism 425 class volunteered to be part 
of the video report card experiment. Their parents received an individually 
tailored tape of 25 to 30 minutes in which Sneed, seated in his back yard in El 
Cajon, offered a critique of their son's or daughter's performance. 
</P>
<P>
Feedback from an accompanying questionnaire was upbeat: 100% of the mothers and 
88% of the fathers liked the video idea. Among the dissenters was a father who 
upbraided Sneed for criticizing his daughter's use of mathematics in a story 
she wrote about the county marshal's budget. 
</P>
<P>
"He said that one criticism negated everything good in the report card, and he 
told me his daughter got straight A's in high school math," Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
Sneed says he will use the video report cards again if the students are 
amenable, the class is small enough and his wife again agrees to do the camera 
work. Of course, if video report cards spread to the lower grades, certain 
behavioral patterns will be altered. 
</P>
<P>
The classic excuse given by students for the disappearance of their report card 
before scrutiny by their parents -- "The dog ate it" -- might have to be 
updated. Stay tuned for: "I erased it, by mistake. Honest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drawing the Line 
</P>
<P>
In a dispute between management and a labor union, you might figure the 
business-oriented Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce would side with 
management. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of philosophy, that may be true, but when philosophy stands in the 
way of political access, look for philosophy to give way. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: the chamber booked the restaurant at the new Hyatt Regency Hotel 
in Sacramento for a gala breakfast March 28 as part of an annual two-day 
lobbying trip. The breakfast is meant to give 30-plus chamber leaders a chance 
to meet informally with the county's legislative delegation. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the invitations were mailed out, Assemblyman Peter Chacon notified 
the chamber that he, and possibly other Democratic legislators, would not 
attend because it would require crossing a picket line by members of the 
Restaurant and Hotel Workers Union Local 47. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber last week sent amended invitations announcing that the breakfast 
has been shifted to the Capitol Restaurant, where the employees are already 
represented by Local 47. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Pressure Pitch 
</P>
<P>
The folks who run the San Dieguito Water District are not happy with a Cardiff 
plumber who distributed 100-plus flyers warning homeowners that water pressure 
has increased ominously in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of pressure can cause considerable damage to your house," say the 
flyers. " . . .Think of the mess you may have to live in, while carpets and 
padding are removed and damage to furniture as well." 
</P>
<P>
Alarmed water customers have called both the city of Encinitas and the water 
district demanding an explanation. "Old people are afraid their pipes are about 
to burst," said water district office manager Beth Stone. 
</P>
<P>
Stone and other officials say pressure has not increased, and they offer what 
they say is a watertight explanation: Unlike districts that use pumps, the San 
Dieguito system is strictly gravity flow and, at last report, Newton's law of 
motion and gravity (F=ma, or Force equals mass times acceleration) is still in 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
For doubters, the city is offering free pressure tests. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has also been turned over to the San Diego County Sheriff's 
Department. (The flyers offer to install a pressure regulator for $85.)

PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: JUMP THROUGH HOOPS? NOT TO LEARN THIS GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Until 7 years ago, Maurice Marsac never thought much about croquet. He was more 
into tennis, skin diving, swimming and sailing. 
</P>
<P>
But today, at age 70, Marsac has been named the professional of the two new 
regulation croquet courts at Park Newport Apartments in Newport Beach. He 
carries a Class A ranking as a croquet player. 
</P>
<P>
But it may be that the younger tenants of the luxury apartment complex will be 
the ones most likely to seek his advice on how to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Croquet is growing very, very fast in Southern California," said Marsac, who 
worked most of his life as a character actor. Before retiring, he was a regular 
as the French teacher in the "Our Miss Brooks" TV show. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, yes, people in (Southern California) are always looking for 
something new to do," he said. "The game is much more popular in Northern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Marsac said he is "not that great a player, but I have a lot of experience and 
have taken a number of courses." 
</P>
<P>
Marsac may be understating his ability: He will play in a dozen tournaments 
this year, many of them for big purses. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some tournaments that have good backers who provide purses as high 
as $25,000," he said, one of the reasons that croquet is starting to attract 
younger players who find it takes just a year to become a competitive player. 
</P>
<P>
"People starting out can really have a nice game after 10 to 12 sessions, and 
after 1 year a normal player can have a decent tournament," he said, adding 
that croquet "can be played equally as well by both men and women." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said croquet players have a lifetime sport: "Croquet can be 
played to a very old age, even though you do cover a lot of ground playing in 
tournaments." 
</P>
<P>
In an average tournament, players may have to walk 5 miles to finish a 
competition that can encompass five games, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That keeps me in as good a shape as can be expected for a man of my age," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Marsac, who lives in the San Fernando Valley and is a member of the Beverly 
Hills Croquet Club, noted that golfers and tennis players make good croquet 
players because of their ability to judge distances and angles. 
</P>
<P>
"That's another reason we are seeing more young players," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the role of resident pro is not a full-time activity, "I'm able to do 
many things, because I work very little these days," he said. "I'm able to 
enjoy my retirement," which includes trips in the next months to Bermuda, 
Arizona and Paris, where he was born. 
</P>
<P>
"I may even get in a tournament of two during those little trips," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It took Westminster's Mike Turner 6 weeks to prepare a menu for 20 demanding 
guests, and that was after he spent 6,000 hours of on-the-job training and 3 
years of classes at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
Now he has completed the college's cook apprenticeship program. The final touch 
was the meal he prepared for those 20 discriminating diners, according to Robin 
Hood OCC's culinary arts instructor and head chef. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike did a superlative job," said Hood, who was one of three professional 
chefs to critique the meal. 
</P>
<P>
This was the menu: 
</P>
<P>
Artichoke with caviar mayonnaise and yellow pepper puree; potato soup with 
spaghetti squash; minestrone and oak-leaf salad with chervil vinaigrette; 
poached salmon with chive butter sauce, served with corn custard, plus tomatoes 
and fennel root, and hazelnut torts with creme anglaise. 
</P>
<P>
Artist Alida Van Gores of Laguna Beach teaches free senior-citizen art classes 
paid for by the Sawdust Festival in the American Legion building. 
</P>
<P>
She said half of her students have never had an art lesson, so she said she 
specializes in "terrified beginners." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- The Hornet, Fullerton College's student newspaper, was named 
a medalist in Columbia University's national newspaper competition. 
</P>
<P>
Journalism instructor and Hornet adviser Julie Davey said the newspaper has 
also been nominated for the prestigious Crown Award, given to just 5% of the 
2,545 newspapers that enter the competition. 
</P>
<P>
Winners will be announced March 14-18 in New York City.

AIRPORT PARKING'S FREE AND EASY FOR SOME POLITICIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA and DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Between the busy East and West terminals at Lindbergh Field there's a spot with 
about a dozen parking spaces. It's closed to the public. But it's open and 
reserved for local elected officials, who park there free while they travel on 
official business. 
</P>
<P>
The VIP lot was created by the San Diego Unified Port District in 1979 and is 
reserved for a list of about 50 elected officials, ranging from San Diego City 
Council members and state legislators to the sheriff and local congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
Port District spokesman Dan Wilkens says the idea behind the lot is to make it 
easier for elected officials to do their work by "facilitating and assisting" 
them as they dash to their planes for flights to political capitals such as 
Sacramento and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issued Parking Cards 
</P>
<P>
If the lot is full, the politicians still get to park free in the big public 
parking lots across from the terminals. That's because the Port District issues 
these elected officials a small plastic card that gets them in and out of the 
lots without paying. Rates at those lots range from $8 to $10 a day. 
</P>
<P>
The Port District keeps no records about which officials use it or how often, 
and assumes elected officials are on official business when they park in the 
lot, which is also available to Port District maintenance trucks and is 
designated as a fire lane in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
"If a U. S. Congressman says he is going on official business . . . I think you 
have to take him at his word," Wilkens said. 
</P>
<P>
Periodically, airport police make a spot check of the cars in the lot and check 
a car's registration with the state Department of Motor Vehicles to make sure 
unauthorized vehicles aren't parking there illegally. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of parking at the lot is left for the politicians to estimate, since 
they know how long they parked there, Wilkens said. But the value of having 
such reserved space at a busy airport such at Lindbergh is known by anyone who 
has had to fight traffic and compete with other passengers searching for a 
parking space. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most frequent users are members of the local legislative delegation 
to Sacramento, seven of whom reported using the special lot on their 
economic-interest statements filed last week at the state Capitol. Lawmakers 
are required to report their free use of the lot as a gift from the Port 
District. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't advertise it," said Assemblyman Bill Bradley (R-San Marcos), the 
biggest user among those filing reports, noting that the parking privilege was 
worth $600 last year. "The average citizen would probably be upset knowing we 
get a free parking pass." 
</P>
<P>
Without the parking lot, Bradley said, he would have his staff drive him to the 
airport in a state car, which would also cost the taxpayers money. 
</P>
<P>
Said San Diego Democratic Assemblywoman Lucy Killea: "I live 6 or 7 minutes 
away. At 6 in the morning, it's a godsend, because we can pop right in and get 
on the plane. For those who live far away and have to travel 40 minutes before 
they get there, it's even more important." Killea reported the worth of parking 
there last year at $320. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Wadie Deddeh, the Bonita Democrat, put the worth of parking at the 
special airport last year at $310. "You park and enter the terminal. It's very 
convenient. I appreciate it," Deddeh said. "I have a definite reason why I must 
be in Sacramento. I cannot miss a plane. Sometimes when you drive 25 to 30 
minutes to get there, you want to find an easy place to park. That's why 
they've afforded it." 
</P>
<P>
"The day they say you cannot park there," he said, "we will not park there." 
</P>
<P>
Offering a similar explanation was Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-La Mesa), who 
reported the free cost of parking at $310. "Getting back and forth to 
Sacramento is very much a product of the job," he said. "That's where we're 
parking while we're doing our jobs. If the port didn't pick it up, the state 
would have to pay for it. That's the only difference." 
</P>
<P>
Other legislators who reported using the lot last year were Assemblyman Robert 
Frazee (R-Carlsbad), $310, and Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego), $351.74, 
which included a breakfast provided by the Port District.

About 200 angry veterans, their friends and families, some choking back tears, 
marched on the Art Institute in Chicago, demanding an end to a student exhibit 
that allows the American flag to be walked upon. "We are absolutely outraged at 
the insensitivity of the Art Institute," Tom Stack, a Vietnam veteran, told 
flag- and sign-waving protesters from the steps of the institute. In 
subfreezing, windy weather, Stack told the crowd, including several veterans in 
wheelchairs, that the issue is respect for the nation's symbol, not freedom of 
expression. The exhibit features the flag spread on the floor beneath 
photographs of flags, including some draped over coffins, and a shelf which 
holds a ledger. Visitors may use the ledger to record their comments.

Colombia's left-wing Patriotic Union withdrew from peace talks promoted by the 
government after the killing of Jose Antequera, one of its leaders, party 
sources said. Patriotic Union's national committee took the action because the 
government failed to protect its leaders from assassination, a member of the 
committee said. The decision came a day after gunmen shot and killed Antequera, 
37.

While the nation's biggest cities employ thousands of police, nearly half of 
all local law enforcement agencies have fewer than 10 officers, the Bureau of 
Justice Statistics reported. And there are 987 local police departments in the 
nation that can count but one officer on their staffs, according to the first 
detailed analysis of law enforcement agencies to be compiled by the federal 
government. At the other end of the scale, 34 local police agencies and 12 
sheriff's departments reported having 1,000 or more officers when the survey 
was conducted in 1987. All state police agencies, 99% of sheriff's offices and 
97% of local police agencies with 135 or more officers now require at least a 
high school diploma, the study found. A separate analysis of police standards 
in 1967 found only 70% required such a diploma. The new study found that about 
10% of the larger police departments and 6% of sheriff's operations are now 
requiring prospective officers to have at least some college education.

Winter hung on in much of the nation, with a blanket of frigid air stretching 
from the Great Lakes into parts of Texas, where more than a foot of snow fell. 
Lows of 20 degrees in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area and 5 below zero in Denver 
shattered records for the date, the National Weather Service said. At the 
Dallas-Ft. Worth airport, many flights were delayed because of icy conditions, 
airline officials said. Baird, Tex., west of Abilene, received 10 to 14 inches 
of snow, the Callahan County sheriff's dispatcher said, and Nocona got 11 
inches.

Iran and China agreed to establish closer ties, with China pledging to help 
Iran recover from its eight-year war with Iraq, Iran's state-run media said. 
Deputy Premier Tian Jiyun of China, who arrived Friday, held talks in Tehran 
with President Ali Khamenei and Prime Minister Hussein Moussavi, the official 
IRNA news agency reported. China was one of Iran's major arms suppliers during 
the Persian Gulf War, and since a truce last August, the two countries have 
signed agreements for several construction projects in Iran and on sharing 
communications technology.

Sixty-seven bus drivers, subway motormen and conductors -- those trusted to 
transport thousands of New Yorkers daily -- have tested positive for hard drugs 
over an 11-week period, a newspaper reported. Traces of such drugs as cocaine, 
methadone, morphine, codeine and marijuana were also found in the urine of 79 
other Transit Authority employees, including police officers, dispatchers, 
track workers and car cleaners. The results of the tests were released to the 
Daily News under the Freedom of Information Act. Those testing positive 
included 41 bus drivers, 10 subway motormen, 16 conductors and five transit 
police officers, the paper said. In each group, at least half tested positive 
for cocaine.

The newly elected leader of South Africa's ruling party called for urgent talks 
to decide whether he or President P. W. Botha is going to be in charge of South 
Africa. Frederik W. de Klerk succeeded Botha as National Party leader after the 
president suffered a stroke Jan. 18. Botha has since announced he will remain 
as head of state until his term ends in September. "After my conversation with 
(Botha) on March 2 and his statements after that, it is clear the time for 
(discussing his retirement plans) is fast approaching," De Klerk told the 
Sunday Star newspaper. The prospect of Botha, 73, returning to power next month 
has dismayed those South Africans who had hoped the government would resume its 
reforms of apartheid after years of stagnation on the divisive issue.

Poland disbanded three army regiments over the weekend, but Western military 
attaches invited to watch said they were unable to verify the numbers of men 
and weapons affected. Defense Minister Florian Siwicki announced plans last 
month to disband a motorized training regiment and two medium tank regiments 
under cutbacks totaling 40,000 men, 850 tanks and 30 fighter planes over the 
next two years. Polish media reports said about 1,000 conscripts were released 
from service early and entered the reserves as a result of the dissolution of 
the regiments. Western attaches said the moves were part of a restructuring 
that will produce a leaner but more effective Polish army, now estimated at 
394,000 men.

INSULIN DOSES HELP CHILDREN

<P>
High doses of insulin appear to at least temporarily prevent the destruction of 
cells in the pancreas that causes the most common form of diabetes among 
children. Researchers at the University of South Florida Health Sciences Center 
in Tampa gave 12 children who had just been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes four 
times the usual dose of the hormone insulin for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to 14 children with Type 1 diabetes who received normal amounts of 
insulin, those who received the intensive insulin appeared to have been spared 
the destruction of cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. 
</P>
<P>
At least 500,000 children in the United States have Type 1 or insulin-dependent 
diabetes. The condition is caused by the lack of production of insulin by the 
pancreas. Insulin controls blood sugar levels. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sharish Shah and his colleagues reported in the New England Journal of 
Medicine that the patients who received the high doses of insulin were 
producing significantly more insulin one year after the treatment than the 14 
children who did not.

Chinese men appear to respond differently to a high blood pressure drug than 
white men, indicating the races react uniquely to medications. The findings, 
reported last week, suggest that medical research should be more careful to 
determine how people from different ethnic backgrounds respond to the same 
drugs, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Alastair Wood and his colleagues at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, 
Tenn., compared the responses of 10 men of Chinese descent and 10 American 
white men to varying doses of the high blood pressure drug propranolol. 
</P>
<P>
In a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers 
found that the drug reduced the heart rate and blood pressure of the Chinese 
men much more than it reduced the pulse and pressure of the white men. 
</P>
<P>
"We conclude that Chinese men have greater sensitivity than white men to the 
effects of propranolol on heart rate and blood pressure," the researchers 
wrote.

NICOTINE GUM OF LITTLE HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nicotine gum, chewed by smokers trying to kick the habit, is probably of little 
value in the way it is most often used, researchers said last week. 
</P>
<P>
The finding was based on a study of 315 smokers, some of whom were given the 
gum and others a look-alike without nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
After one year there was no statistically significant difference between those 
given the nicotine gum and those who had the placebo in terms of how many were 
able to stop smoking, doctors at the University of Vermont College of Medicine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We conclude that, when used with a nonselected group of smokers and a brief 
intervention in general medical practice, the pharmacologic effects of nicotine 
gum to increase smoking cessation are either small or nonexistent," they said. 
</P>
<P>
"This conclusion is important because the large majority (99%) of smokers are 
not screened for nicotine dependence and receive nicotine gum with brief 
intervention," they added. The study was published the Journal of the American 
Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the Food and Drug Administration's guidelines for the gum 
specify that it be used in conjunction with a behavioral modification program. 
But the study said 99.5% of those given the gum are not in such a program, are 
unwilling to enter one and receive the gum after only a brief visit with their 
physician.

Daughters of women with osteoporosis appear to be at increased risk of 
developing the bone-thinning disease, Australian researchers reported last 
week. Dr. Ego Seeman and his colleagues at the Austin Hospital in Melbourne 
compared 32 women whose mothers had osteoporosis to 22 women whose mothers did 
not have the disease, which affects roughly 20 million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
In results published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers 
found that daughters of osteoporosis patients were more likely to have thinner 
bones than daughters of healthy women. 
</P>
<P>
"We conclude that daughters of women with osteoporosis have a reduced bone mass 
. . . and this reduction in bone mass may put them at increased risk for 
fractures," the researchers wrote.

L.A.'S HISTORIC AMBASSADOR HOTEL WILL BE OFFERED FOR SALE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The historic Ambassador Hotel, once a playground for film stars, business 
tycoons and even royalty -- and the site of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's 
assassination in June, 1968 -- will be offered for sale today through a sealed 
bidding process, the owners announced. 
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old, mid-Wilshire hotel closed its doors last January amid reports 
that a joint venture of British and American developers was negotiating to buy 
the property for $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership included London-based Walker Power Corp. Ltd., owners and 
developers of retail and leisure facilities primarily in Britain, and Scott 
Malkin, a New York City developer whose family owns or has controlling 
interests in the Empire State Building and commercial properties nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan-Stanley Realty in New York said that under the new bidding process, 
potential buyers for the 23.5-acre site can submit a preliminary "non-binding 
offer" by June 1. After that, a select group of bidders will be invited to 
submit formal, binding offers. 
</P>
<P>
The seller is the J. Myer Schine family trusts. Schine, a theater and hotel 
magnate who died in 1971, bought the Ambassador in 1946.

3RD YEAR OF DROUGHT FORCES STATE'S FARMERS TO MAKE TOUGH CHOICES 
</P>

<P>
John Vereschagin's almond trees were already beginning to bud in the springlike 
sunshine. Across the road was a new olive orchard Vereschagin and his sons had 
set out last year. The young trees' roots were stirring from dormancy, and the 
soil appeared as moist as if it had recently rained. 
</P>
<P>
But not a cloud was in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
"We just finished irrigating the other day," he explained to a recent visitor 
to his family's 2,000-acre ranch near this farming community in the upper 
Sacramento Valley. "Normally, irrigation is the last thing on our minds at this 
time of year." 
</P>
<P>
Water is the first thing on the minds of most farmers in the state this year, 
however, as the nation's No. 1 agricultural producer prepares for a new 
planting season in the face of a virtually unprecedented third straight year of 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
With reservoirs at about two-thirds of normal capacity for February and the 
Sierra Nevada snowpack about a third smaller than usual, California's vaunted 
water-distribution system will be taxed even beyond the two-year drought of 
1976-77, which cost the state's economy an estimated $2.4 billion in lost 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pumping Underground Water 
</P>
<P>
California's elaborate system of water storage and distribution facilities 
enabled the state's farmers to bring in a $15-billion harvest last year, 
despite a second year of drought. But this year, all along the yawning Central 
Valley, which stretches from Redding to Bakersfield, stored water is at a 
premium. 
</P>
<P>
As in the case of Vereschagin, farmers up and down the state are preparing the 
soil for planting, and some are protecting their crops by pumping underground 
water that becomes more precious with each passing day. Their litanies vary 
little. 
</P>
<P>
* Robert Clark, manager of the Clenn-Colusa Water District in Willows, south of 
Orland, said he expects rice acreage to plunge by more than a third this year 
to 54,000 acres. Customers of the water district include some of the state's 
largest rice growers. Rice requires about seven acre-feet of water per acre, 
about four of which are recovered for use downstream. "My phone's been busy all 
day," Clark said. (An acre-foot is the amount of water that would cover one 
acre to a depth of one foot.) 
</P>
<P>
* In the San Joaquin Valley, the Kern County Water Agency expects only 40% of 
the 1.1 million acre-feet of water that it normally gets from the State Water 
Project. "This is going to hurt," said Gene Lundquist, a director of the water 
agency and a vice president at Calcot Ltd., a cotton marketing cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
* Among the hardest-hit water districts will likely be Westlands, on the 
opposite side of the San Joaquin Valley from Fresno. While 2.5 acre-feet of 
water are needed to irrigate an acre of cotton, the district expects to get 
Central Valley Project water amounting to about one acre-foot per acre. So 
farmers depending on that district will be obliged to take land out of 
production to conserve enough water to have any crops at all. 
</P>
<P>
Across the valley from Orland, Lake Oroville, the largest reservoir in the 
State Water Project, lies more than 165 feet below the rim of the massive 
earthen dam impounding it. "In 1983 you could almost touch it from here," 
recalled a resident enjoying the sunshine and broad vistas while strolling atop 
the dam. 
</P>
<P>
According to an assessment prepared by the state Department of Water Resources, 
if 1989 reproduces the same subnormal precipitation of the preceding two years, 
it will mean "inadequate supplies for urban and agricultural users, poorer 
water quality, impacts on fish and wildlife, fewer recreational opportunities 
and reduction of hydroelectric power." 
</P>
<P>
"It's about 60% of normal and deteriorating daily," Jason Peltier, manager of 
the Central Valley Project Water Assn., said of the project's storage 
situation. Urban residents will feel the impact of this drought, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Likely to be among the more seriously affected urban counties is Santa Clara, 
where the reservoirs that normally supply 40% of the water for 16 cities are 
"virtually empty," according to water district spokeswoman Teddy Morse. 
Moreover, shipments of water from the State Water Project and the federal 
Central Valley Project will likely be cut in half, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way we'll make it is to cut consumption by 45%, and we'll never do 
that through voluntary efforts," Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moment of Truth 
</P>
<P>
Similar restrictions on water consumption are likely to be imposed in much of 
Southern California as well. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power 
faces diminished supplies from east of the Sierras, and the Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California last year warned that cutbacks will be likely 
for all customers -- agricultural, industrial and residential. 
</P>
<P>
But for farmers facing planting decisions the moment of truth is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Joaquin Valley, farmers begin planting cotton March 20 but must 
prepare their fields now. Most, as with the rice growers, will have the option 
of signing up for federal crop subsidies -- the state's only major subsidized 
crops. Drought will certainly make more attractive the requirement that 
participants set aside 25% of their usual cotton and rice acreage, even though 
that is double last year's requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, said Kevin McDermott, vice president for economic research for Calcot 
Ltd., a cotton marketing cooperative, many participants will plant far less 
than they could, even under the program. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all looking at our options," said John Pucheu Jr., Calcot's chairman and 
a cotton grower at Tranquility, a well-watered haven near the confluence of the 
San Joaquin and Kings rivers. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't leave the whole farm idle," Pucheu explained. "You pick and choose. 
For us, cotton is our most important crop, so we'll do everything to grow as 
much as we can. But if we also grew a lot of vegetables, or had orchards to 
keep alive, our choices would be different." 
</P>
<P>
But the effects of the drought vary widely. For example, the Placer County 
Water Agency east of Sacramento expects to meet "100% of our commitments" this 
year and still have surplus water to sell, said Ed Schnabel, general manager. 
Its reservoirs stand at 80% of total capacity, he said, and the snowpack high 
up in its watershed appears to be ample at this point. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more than 10 feet of snow up there," Schnabel said. "But storms are 
pretty hit and miss." 
</P>
<P>
To the north, storms have been more miss than hit. And, as a result, Lake 
Shasta, the largest reservoir in California, is at about 40% of total capacity, 
or about two-thirds of normal for February. The Central Valley Project expects 
to cut all deliveries by at least 50% this year. 
</P>
<P>
That's particularly rough on the Orland-Artois Water District, which serves the 
Vereschagin family's orchards of almonds, olives and prunes. "We're in the 
worst situation of any water district in the state," said Vereschagin, who 
doubles as a water district director. 
</P>
<P>
While the district has actually received 80,000 acre-feet of water a year, its 
contract provides for deliveries of only 53,000 acre-feet, said manager Gus 
Lohse. So the 50% cut will entitle the district to just 26,500 acre-feet this 
year -- about 25% of what it had needed. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 29,500 irrigated acres in the district," said Vereschagin. "That's 
less than one acre-foot per acre." (Orchard crops require more than four 
acre-feet, he said.) 
</P>
<P>
"You can cut back and keep the tree alive," he acknowledged, "but if you do, 
you're affecting not just this year's crop but the crop next year and possibly 
the third year down the line." 
</P>
<P>
While petitioning the Bureau of Reclamation for special relief, the district's 
farmers -- like their counterparts up and down the state -- are assigning 
priorities to their acreage and crops. For example, Vereschagin said he will 
not replant emerging stands of oats -- thirsty crops -- to save available water 
for the family's more valuable orchards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3rd Year of Drought 
</P>
<P>
Downstream in Willows, Randy Lindquist raises cows and yearling steers. 
Lindquist said he has already cut the size of his herd because of the 
sparseness of grass and high cost of hay, "when you can find it." He has also 
had to haul well water to supply water holes and troughs normally filled by 
rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
"I've already had my third year of drought," Lindquist said. "We're pretty well 
shot, no matter what rains come now." 
</P>
<P>
His main concern, though, is whether to cut his herd further to reduce costs 
but jeopardize its future quality. While he can later buy replacements, he 
acknowledged, it has taken 18 years of breeding to produce the quality of his 
herd, which yields a 700-pound animal in the time it originally took to produce 
one weighing 475 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't just go out and buy that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the state's fertile salad bowl, the Salinas Valley, who usually get 
by with natural rainfall, have started their pumps early this year, said 
vegetable farmer Sig Christierson. "We shouldn't have to be irrigating our 
fields at this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
There are problems with heavy pumping, too, added Joe Tonascia, who grows a 
wide range of vegetables year-round down the valley in Hollister, San Benito 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"With everybody trying to pump, the water table goes down, and as the level 
drops so does the quality, and that's rough on the crops," Tonascia explained. 
"Right now, I'm at full bore on my irrigation." 
</P>
<P>
San Benito County usually gets about 12 inches of rain a year, almost all of it 
in the first three months. 
</P>
<P>
"If it rains for the next 30 days it won't bother me," Tonascia said.

TIME WARNER CAPS STEVE ROSS' BIG COMEBACK; 
</P>
<P>
WITH HUGE MEDIA MERGER, HE LIVES UP TO IMAGE AS FINANCIAL GENIUS, DREAMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is, in the understatement of one analyst, a "career capper." 
</P>
<P>
With the weekend announcement that Time Inc. and Warner Communications will 
merge, 61-year-old Warner Communications Chairman Steven J. Ross is set to 
become co-chief executive of the largest media company in the world, alongside 
Time Chairman J. Richard Munro. 
</P>
<P>
While Munro has indicated that he will retire within two years, Ross -- under 
terms spelled out in the merger agreement -- enjoys the chairman's title for 
fully 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The new company, to be called Time Warner, will boast such coveted assets as 
Warner Bros. studio, three recorded music companies, the nation's second 
largest cable television company, Time's magazine publishing empire and Home 
Box Office. 
</P>
<P>
With this deal, Ross delivers to Warner shareholders nearly 60% of a new 
company that could change the ground rules for entertainment, broadcasting and 
publishing. Time Warner will have a market value of $15 billion, at current 
stock prices. Counting the amount of debt held by the two firms, the deal is 
valued by the companies themselves at $18 billion -- making it one of the 
largest corporate transactions ever in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
To many business associates and friends, it is Ross' greatest coup -- all the 
sweeter because it comes less than a decade after Warner suffered through 
disastrous losses and a bribery-kickback scandal in its executive ranks. In 
three years, Warner has made a triumphant recovery -- doubling revenues to $4.2 
billion and profits to $423 million. 
</P>
<P>
Quite an achievement for Ross, a product of Brooklyn and a junior college in 
upstate New York who got his start working for his father-in-law in a chain of 
funeral parlors. Even those who once harshly criticized Warner Communications 
-- for dangerously loose management that failed to anticipate a bust in the 
video game business in late 1982 -- now feel that Ross deserves to preside over 
a company as powerful and prestigious as Time Warner will surely be. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Ross demurred from calling the merger the crowning achievement of his 
career. "I hope what we're going to do next year will be the crowning 
achievement," the Warner chairman said Saturday when the merger was announced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Young Entrepreneur 
</P>
<P>
From an unlikely start in the funeral parlor business, Ross' 30-year career has 
been studded with success, beginning with his idea of launching a car-rental 
business with the limousines that were idled at night. The car-rental business 
took off, and in 1961, Ross merged it with Kinney System, New York's largest 
parking lot concern, and an office cleaning firm run by his brothers-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
But Ross tired of these businesses, according to one biographer, because they 
lacked "charisma." In 1968 and 1969, he acquired a publisher of comic books and 
Mad Magazine; a talent agency and Warner Bros. -- Seven Arts, the owner of two 
record labels and a money-losing movie studio. Over the next two years, Ross 
added the Elektra and Asylum record companies and three cable TV firms, and 
began divesting most of Kinney's original businesses. The company was renamed 
Warner Communications in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
By 1982, Warner was the toast of Wall Street, thanks largely to the stunning 
revenues of its Atari video game unit, which generated $2 billion in sales at 
its peak. But a sudden reversal in the marketplace late that year caught Atari 
and Warner executives off guard. Before the debacle ended with the sale of 
Atari in mid-1984, the cumulative losses were put at $875 million. 
</P>
<P>
During the same period, Ross had to live down a federal prosecutor's contention 
that the Warner chairman was "the real culprit" in the entertainment company's 
dealings with the Westchester Premier Theater that led to convictions of two 
Warner executives in connection with a bribery-kickback scheme. Earlier, 
federal prosecutors had convicted several organized crime figures of skimming 
profits of the live-performance theater in Tarrytown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won Respect 
</P>
<P>
Ross "was never indicted for anything and there was no evidence that he should 
have been," said Jac E. Holzman, who sold his Electra record company to Warner 
in 1970 and continues to serve as Warner's chief technologist. Despite the 
embarrassment of the headlines, Holzman said Sunday, "I don't think that was as 
painful for him as Atari." 
</P>
<P>
In December 1982, Warner shocked Wall Street by announcing that it might make 
$100 million less in pretax profits than analysts had expected, due to canceled 
orders for its Atari video games. But Ross handled the debacle in a manner that 
won the respect first of his executives, and eventually, the investing public. 
</P>
<P>
"He flew every key executive into New York and . . . faced us," Holzman 
recalled. "I think it took a lot of guts." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Crawford, senior vice president of Capital Research, the Los Angeles 
money management firm whose clients hold more than 8% of Warner stock, said: "I 
think in the post-Atari era, the guy's done everything right." 
</P>
<P>
Crawford and others cite Ross' sale of subsidiaries such as Franklin Mint, 
Showtime/the Movie Channel and Atari for good prices, and his strategy of 
retaining a stake in the properties that were sold. 
</P>
<P>
When Warner's financial health was restored, Ross proved that he had not lost 
his nerve or instinct for acquisitions, with the timely purchase of a giant 
music publishing concern before prices for similar companies soared. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a real strong vision of where the entertainment business is going and . 
. . he is one of the great talents for making deals happen," said Crawford, 
whose company also holds about 8% of Time Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually financial wizards and dreamers are not packaged together. Steve is 
both," said New York attorney Arthur Liman, a friend and legal adviser. "Steve 
is a person who dreams of how to create new markets for his businesses; he's a 
person who dreams things that seem unattainable and then applies his enormous 
financial abilities to try to make them happen. But he also has a quality that 
I've never seen, and that is his skill with human beings. Steve genuinely likes 
the talent who work for the company." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
People Skills Praised 
</P>
<P>
Ross "calls people and encourages them and boosts their morale when they've had 
failures," Liman continued. As a result, Ross has won the loyalty of Hollywood 
stars and Warner studio executives alike. They "tend to be like cats who will 
never leave home," Liman said. 
</P>
<P>
In the boardroom, Ross apparently exhibits similar skills. Hugh Culverhouse, 
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers football team owner who joined the Warner board in 
1986 as a nominee of dissident shareholder Chris-Craft Industries, on Sunday 
called Ross "one of the most astute deal makers" who has "the ability to see 
into the future" yet who will also "subordinate his position to others." 
</P>
<P>
When Warner's 13 directors voted on the merger last Friday, Culverhouse was 
among the 12 who voted in favor, while his original sponsor, Chris-Craft 
Chairman Herbert J. Siegel, abstained. 
</P>
<P>
Although Chris-Craft will become one of Time Warner's largest shareholders with 
a 14% stake of voting shares, Siegel is not expected to be invited to join the 
board -- thus ending a painful chapter for Ross, who welcomed Siegel as a white 
knight in late 1983 when Warner faced a takeover threat from media magnate 
Rupert Murdoch. 
</P>
<P>
Siegel, critical of Warner's lavish style, quickly became a thorn in Ross' side 
while the Warner chairman struggled with the Atari-generated losses. Their most 
unpleasant spats included a Siegel lawsuit in 1987 to obtain a sealed, 663-page 
report on an internal investigation of the company's dealings in the 1970s with 
Westchester Theater. In 1987, a Siegel lawsuit delayed Warner's purchase of 
Lorimar Telepictures, one of the nation's leading television programmers, until 
early this year. 
</P>
<P>
Siegel has been unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
With his problems behind him, Ross is expected to bring to Time Warner an 
entrepreneurial spirit that many believe has been in short supply at Time Inc. 
and a vision for the direction of the entertainment and media industries. Ross 
and Time's Munro have said they share an ambition of creating a powerful 
American media conglomerate that can hold its own against increasingly large 
and formidable international competitors such as West Germany's Bertelsmann 
A.G. and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of a kind," said Liman. "In a world that is filled with people with 
MBAs, here you have this graduate of Paul Smiths College . . . dreaming of 
markets in Europe and what technology is going to do."

FOOTNOTES: WIN ONE FOR THE OLD BROKER

The best players in Los Angeles' securities industry aren't jumping through 
hoops. They're aiming at them. On March 19, West Coast offices of several 
investment firms will compete in a tournament to raise funds for the National 
Multiple Sclerosis Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street West Basketball Challenge -- to be held at the Great Western 
Forum -- is modeled after a benefit in New York. Companies scheduled to field 
teams include Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards; Dean Witter Reynolds; Kidder 
Peabody; Morgan Stanley, and Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the companies are taking the competition seriously. At Bateman Eichler, 
a 6-foot-8 employee in Anchorage who played college ball plans to try out. But 
he will be up against about 25 other hopefuls competing for three roster 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a pretty competitive environment here," says Sulfiati 
Magnuson of Bateman Eichler. "These guys like to win." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Marshalls Minds the Store 
</P>
<P>
Marshalls, the nation's largest off-price clothing chain, has taken a small 
step toward solving a big problem: finding a talented pool of retailers to run 
its fast-growing network of stores. 
</P>
<P>
On a visit late last month to Los Angeles, Francis H. Arnone, Marshalls' 
president and chief executive, formally agreed to sponsor a retailing 
internship at Cal State Los Angeles. Students selected for the program would be 
paid while getting on-the-job training and, in some cases, would qualify for a 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"We want manpower to come and run these stores," Arnone said, adding that the 
program is "a way to reach out to minorities." Arnone, a former chairman of the 
Broadway department store chain, now lives in the Boston area, where Marshalls 
is based. But clearly he's still partial to California, where Marshalls has 46 
stores and more than 4,000 employees. Plans call for opening 17 more stores in 
the state by the end of next year.

A Colorado university and a major cable television firm have joined forces to 
offer a select group of Californians -- among 4 million residents of 29 other 
states -- the chance to earn a Master of Business Administration degree without 
leaving their living rooms. Beginning this fall, Colorado State University's 
20-year-old MBA program will be available through Mind Extension University, a 
cable-TV service of Jones International. 
</P>
<P>
In the Southland, cable systems serving Oxnard and the Palmdale-Lancaster area 
will carry the program. 
</P>
<P>
Cable students will receive credit from Colorado State; actual MBA classes at 
the school will be videotaped to give students the benefit of classroom 
questions and answers. Assignments will be handled by mail, and students can 
call a toll-free number to talk to professors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Search of a Good Meal 
</P>
<P>
When Californians let their fingers do the walking, it's often because their 
stomachs are growling. 
</P>
<P>
California residents look up restaurants more than any other category in their 
Yellow Pages directories, according to a survey of 7,000 households around the 
state. The survey was conducted by the San Francisco-based National Yellow 
Pages Monitor. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 7.6% of all consumer use of Yellow Pages directories was to look up 
restaurants, the report said. That was followed by airlines, with 3.5%, and 
physicians and surgeons, with 2.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Also listed in the top 10: auto repair, beauty salons and pizza parlors.

Purchasing Managers See Slowdown: Economic growth slowed in February, easing 
inflation pressures that have pushed short-term interest rates to the highest 
level in four years, the National Assn. of Purchasing Management said. In its 
monthly report based on a survey of purchasing executives at 250 companies, the 
trade group said the U.S. economy expanded but at an even slower rate than the 
sluggish growth seen in January. The group's leading purchasing management 
index was 53% in February, nearly unchanged from 53.2% in January. The previous 
low for the index was 52.6% in February, 1987. The index is a composite of new 
orders, production, deliveries, inventories and employment.

Minnetonka May Look for Buyer: Bloomington, Minn.-based Minnetonka Corp., maker 
of Calvin Klein cosmetics, says it may offer itself for sale to maximize value 
for its shareholders. "Comparable high-margin, luxury product businesses are 
commanding very high values in the private market," said Robert R. Taylor, 
Minnetonka's chairman, chief executive and largest individual shareholder. 
"This underscores our belief that it is in the best interests of our 
shareholders to explore the sale of the company," he said. Analysts said 
Minnetonka could be worth up to $465 million, or $22 to $25 a share.

QINTEX DEAL CHARTS NEW COURSE IN PACIFIC FOR 2 JAPANESE FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mitsui &amp; Co. and Nippon Shinpan Co. have agreed to invest $350 million in 
three resorts owned by Qintex Australia Ltd. -- one in Hawaii and two in 
Australia -- establishing a relationship that could extend into Southern 
California or other areas of the Pacific basin, Qintex said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Each firm will invest $175 million, and each will get 24.5% of the equity in 
the three existing Mirage resorts. Qintex, based in Brisbane, Australia, 
retains 51% ownership of the resorts. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two firms will also have the option of investing 
similar amounts in two future Mirage resorts -- one in Southern California and 
another Mirage project in Florida. Qintex, which will be searching for 
investment partners for the projects, said the Japanese companies will get 
equity in the two new resorts if they match any other investment offer. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex, an Australian conglomerate that owns 43% of Qintex Entertainment, a 
television production company with offices in Beverly Hills, has been searching 
for a Southern California site for a Mirage resort. It plans to open a resort 
in California in one to three years. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex hopes to enlarge its presence in tourism by working with Nippon Shinpan, 
which also has credit card operations, and Mitsui, which is involved in real 
estate and construction, according to Christopher Skase, chairman of Qintex 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"The agreement . . . is consistent with Qintex's philosophy of strengthening 
long-term commercial links around the Pacific Rim," he said. "The linking of 
California, Hawaii, Queensland (Australia) and Japan will form a quadrant of 
strength in the burgeoning tourist market in the Pacific, the fastest-growing 
tourist market in the world."

Another Try at Sale: The Philippine government is seeking a negotiated sale for 
Nonoc Mining &amp; Industrial Corp., after two public tenders earlier this year 
failed to draw an acceptable bid for the mothballed nickel refinery and mine. 
</P>
<P>
The Asset Privatization Trust, which is responsible for the sale, has invited 
offers by March 15 from Dallhold Nickel Management, a subsidiary of Australian 
businessman Alan Bond's family investment company; Falconbridge Inc. of Canada; 
White Rock Corp., which the trust says is acting for South Korean interests, 
and Jesus Cabarrus, the 79-year-old former owner of Nonoc, who is claiming in 
court that government banks foreclosed illegally in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The trust rejected bids from Dallhold at the two earlier tenders, which 
exceeded the government's $300-million indicative price, because they were not 
accompanied by the required deposits.

Erickson says he blames the dearth of customers on the lack of nearby parking 
spaces, but, when pressed, he admits that a nearby discount office supply 
superstore is waging a quiet -- but fierce -- price war against him. 
</P>
<P>
"The warehouses are making inroads," said Erickson, a 42-year veteran of the 
stationery business. "They are definitely going to hurt some of the dealers." 
The players -- big and small -- are all competing for a piece of the 
$90-billion to $100-billion-a-year U.S. office supply market, according to 
industry experts. And it is already evident that many companies will not 
survive the fray. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic change in the office supply industry began about three years ago 
when two former supermarket executives opened a store called Staples in 
Brighton, Mass. Since then, venture capitalists have invested about $200 
million in 16 office supply superstore chains across the country. Office Club, 
BizMart, WORKplace, Office America and Office Depot are only a few of the new 
office products superstores, as they are called. 
</P>
<P>
The no-frills superstores average about 30,000 square feet and stock about 
10,000 different items. They claim to offer savings of up to 50% on everything 
from telephones to stick-on mailing labels. 
</P>
<P>
They can give the discounts because they buy enormous quantities directly from 
the manufacturers. Most of the chain stores stay open long hours, seven days a 
week, unlike the traditional stationer, who keeps regular business hours, 
Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The superstores' strategy has been to target small and medium-size businesses 
eager to save money on office products and equipment. Most superstores can 
outfit a business from scratch, providing everything from the coffee maker to 
the personal computer system hardware and software. 
</P>
<P>
"The superstores have totally upset pricing in the industry," said Jack Miller, 
president of Chicago-based Quill Corp., a $250-million-a-year, mail-order 
office products company. "Everything is up for grabs." 
</P>
<P>
However, Miller feels less threatened by the superstores because he believes 
that his mail-order customers will remain loyal. Mail-order companies accounted 
for 5.3% of the industry's 1987 sales. 
</P>
<P>
Miller predicts that if smaller dealers find themselves unable to compete on 
price, they may be forced to go into what he calls "niche marketing." For 
example, one company may begin to specialize in serving the office products 
needs of hospitals or medical buildings, while another may just focus on 
selling filing systems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offer Personal Service 
</P>
<P>
Most industry leaders are taking a wait-and-see attitude as the superstore 
chains open their doors across the country. "Anytime there are new entrants in 
the marketplace, some people will be affected," said Jack Bodeewes, president 
of the 9,000-member National Office Products Assn. "I'm not sure which segment 
of the industry will be hurt the most." 
</P>
<P>
Bodeewes, who owns Business Products &amp; Services in El Paso, suggests that 
the smaller retailers begin fighting the competition by providing what they are 
best at -- more personal service. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard about people with stationery stores located near the Price Club who 
had to close down," said Raj Patel, owner of Nelson's Stationery on Colorado 
Boulevard in Glendale. "It is kind of scary." 
</P>
<P>
Patel, who bought the 45-year-old business five years ago, said he can give 
customers some discounts on big purchases, but he certainly cannot compete with 
the superstores' prices. 
</P>
<P>
"But you don't get the personal attention at those stores," Patel said. "I 
think that's the only thing a small stationery store can offer." 
</P>
<P>
The superstores have already taken a toll on Sacramento's office supply 
retailers, according to a report in the Sacramento Business Journal. In 
November, the Journal reported that three longtime Sacramento stationery stores 
filed for bankruptcy protection a few months after the first office supply 
superstores moved into town. 
</P>
<P>
The impact on traditional stationers in Los Angeles will probably take longer 
to surface. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, the office supply industry relied on a stable distribution system 
that started with the manufacturer and ended with the dealer but included a 
wholesaler or two in between. By cutting out the wholesalers, and by keeping 
their overhead low, the superstores can offer surprisingly large discounts. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the same roll of 3M Magic transparent tape recently on sale at 
Wolcotts for $1.49 was selling for 99 cents at the downtown Office Club. A 
Swingline 747 model stapler selling for $22.95 at Wolcotts could be had for 
$11.99 at the Office Club. And a staple remover on sale for 79 cents at 
Wolcotts sells for 39 cents at the Office Club. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that the public perception is that the independent dealer is 
gouging them, and that isn't true," Wolcotts' Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No-Frills Setting 
</P>
<P>
Erickson does not deny that products cost less at superstores, but he points to 
the advantages of dealing with smaller retailers, including free delivery. And, 
he said, many small businesses are penalized by being forced to buy hundreds of 
pencils or 1,000 file folders at a time from the superstores when they do not 
really need that volume. 
</P>
<P>
Although service, delivery and credit are still the most attractive reasons to 
buy from a small dealer, many warehouse-format stores now offer these services 
for additional, modest fees. 
</P>
<P>
The office products superstores patterned themselves after general retail 
superstores such as the Home Club and Price Club. They all offer a wide 
selection of products in a no-frills, warehouse setting. 
</P>
<P>
George Orban, president of WORKplace, based in St. Petersburg, Fla., was a 
pioneer in the discount business and said he finds opportunities by looking for 
products with inefficient distribution channels. Earlier, he was a founder of 
Ross Stores Corp., a discount clothing store chain, and of Egghead Software. 
</P>
<P>
WORKplace, with stores in Montebello and City of Industry, plans to open 20 
stores in the Los Angeles area by 1990, according to Orban. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there will always be room for the conveniently located small store, 
because we won't be putting one of these (superstores) on every corner," he 
said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
WORKplace stores differ a bit from the competition because they emphasize 
computers and software. Each WORKplace store features a full Egghead software 
store inside. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Krasnow, vice president of marketing for Staples, said there probably 
won't be 16 different chains of superstores, but "there will be room for a 
few." 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how quickly this is happening," Krasnow said, adding that 
Staples, with 23 stores on the East Coast, expects to gross $120 million this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Begelman, president of Office Club, based in Concord, Calif., said the 
office products world was ripe for change because it was "a gigantic industry 
with antiquated channels of distribution." 
</P>
<P>
California alone offers a $9-billion market for office products, he added. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there are 16 Office Clubs in California, Oregon, Washington and 
Colorado. A basic membership costs $10 a year. Non-members pay 10% more for 
products than members do. For $50 a year, members can order by telephone, have 
merchandise delivered and make credit purchases. 
</P>
<P>
The new downtown Los Angeles Office Club, which opened in the first week of 
January, already boasts 3,500 members. The manager said customers love the free 
parking and easy access off Temple Street. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to give the smallest business person the buying power of IBM," 
Begelman said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, small stationery store owners and managers will watch what happens 
to the big guys with interest. Wolcotts' Erickson predicts that "sooner or 
later some of them are going to go down the tubes." 
</P>
<P>
But, he doesn't deny that he could buy things at a lower cost from them. 
</P>
<P>
"My own wife buys at a warehouse store," he said with a sigh.

JUDGE BARS SUITS BY NINTENDO, ATARI GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nintendo of America and Atari Games, which are waging a two-fisted battle for 
the hearts and wallets of video game lovers, have been prohibited from pulling 
retailers into the fray. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Fern Smith in San Francisco late Friday granted a 
preliminary injunction against Nintendo of America and its Japanese owner, 
Nintendo Co., prohibiting them from filing patent infringement suits against 
retailers that carry Atari Games' Tengen software. She issued a similar ban 
against Atari Games. 
</P>
<P>
Atari Games said in a statement Sunday that the injunction will be in place 
until legal disputes between the two companies have been resolved. The judge 
set a trial date of Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The struggle began two weeks before Christmas, when Atari Games filed suit 
contending that Nintendo monopolized the $2-billion U.S. market for video 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The equipment on which the games are played accepts only special cartridges 
made by Nintendo. In its suit, Atari Games claimed that it had lost $30 million 
to $35 million in sales because Nintendo limited the number of cartridges it 
sold to Atari Games under a licensing agreement for its Pac-Man, RBI Baseball 
and Gauntlet games. 
</P>
<P>
Atari Games also said in the suit that it had developed its own game cartridges 
that were compatible with the Nintendo system. But Nintendo charged in a 
countersuit that development of those cartridges violated the companies' 
contract. Nintendo revoked the licensing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Atari Games, based in Milpitas, Calif., said it sought the injunction after 
learning that several retailers selling its Tengen video games had received 
letters from Nintendo insisting that they "immediately remove all Tengen 
products from their shelves." The letters, according to Atari Games, warned 
that Nintendo would take legal action. 
</P>
<P>
A Nintendo of America official said Sunday that the company, based in Redmond, 
Wash., would try to recover any damages against retailers selling Tengen 
products if the case is decided in Nintendo's favor. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very strongly that our patent is valid and enforceable, and we intend 
to enforce it across the board," said Howard Lincoln, senior vice president.

TWO 'HARD-CORE CAREER' L.A. GANG MEMBERS ESCAPE FROM POLICE JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two suspected gang members described today by Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. 
Gates as "hard-core career" criminals have escaped from the 77th Street police 
station. The fugitives were among 31 suspected gang members who were arrested 
last week in two raids that the police and the FBI carried out in South-Central 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The men who disappeared were identified as Eric Wright, 18, and Buford Bates, 
24. A police spokesman said the two, who were booked Friday on suspicion of 
kidnaping and robbery, "turned up missing" early Monday. Gates blamed 
overcrowding at the jail and said the escape was being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests, made last week, represented the first product of a decision by the 
FBI six months ago to join with local police in a crackdown on gang violence, 
authorities said. Nine of the suspects are being held in a federal jail on drug 
sales charges.

POLICIES PURSUED IN 'REASONED, METHODICAL' WAY, FITZWATER SAYS

<P>
President Bush's Administration is not drifting with lost momentum and 
squandered opportunities, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today, responding to 
a spate of public comments suggesting White House disarray. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply don't agree," Fitzwater told reporters when asked about recent news 
accounts and remarks from various government quarters pointing to the slow pace 
in filling top posts, notably at the State and Defense departments. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the (White House) staff is strong," Fitzwater said, and that 
Administration policies are being pursued in a "reasoned, methodical fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Some "early successes," he asserted, can be seen in a proposed rescue of the 
savings-and-loan industry, a fiscal 1990 budget plan "that arrived alive" on 
Capitol Hill and Bush's recent diplomacy in Japan, China and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased with the progress . . . so far," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he acknowledged distractions such as the bruising Senate 
battle over John Tower's nomination to be defense secretary, saying, "It's been 
a difficult fight . . . (but) we still believe in the candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Bush is staying the course with the politically bloody Tower nomination, but he 
will try to draw some focus away from it through anti-drug speeches in New 
Jersey and Delaware on Tuesday and New York on Thursday, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tower controversy has left the Pentagon without long-term direction, and 
although daily work is being done, the Administration has missed some business 
and planning deadlines. Likewise at the State Department, where Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III has yet to complete his team, complaints are growing 
louder. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post described the State Department in a front-page article 
today as "mired in a gloomy atmosphere of drift, sagging morale and lack of 
communication between the Foggy Bottom bureaucracy and Baker's small palace 
guard of trusted political aides." 
</P>
<P>
In the newspaper's Sunday commentary section, former Reagan White House 
Communications Director David Gergen warned that Bush's early emphasis on vague 
"style over substance" has put him "perilously on the edge of a cliff . . . 
(with) a deepening sense in Washington that something is badly amiss." 
</P>
<P>
In Malibu, Calif., today former President Ronald Reagan said he has agreed with 
everything President Bush has said -- so far. 
</P>
<P>
"They are setting up their Administration so I am kind of waiting to hear his 
declaration on programs. There is still some reorganization, some journeys he's 
making and he has not set a course," Reagan told a crowd of 3,500 students and 
guests at Pepperdine University's Firestone Field House. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard him say anything I disagree with. . . . They haven't got into 
the policy part yet."

Traffic moved slowly but major problems failed to materialize today on the 
Ventura Freeway when five ramps were closed as part of a lengthy widening 
project, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected a major traffic tie-up but it went really smooth this morning," 
CHP Sgt. Steve Santoro said. "It was stop-and-go traffic, but it moved quicker 
than expected. I think a lot of people took heed and scheduled more time for 
their commute. If they followed directions, they had an easy commute." 
</P>
<P>
Ramps that were closed include the westbound on-ramp at Topanga Canyon 
Boulevard, the westbound off-ramp at Parkway Calabasas, the westbound and 
eastbound off-ramps at Valley Circle and the eastbound off-ramp at Fallbrook 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans opened two freeway bypass routes in Woodland Hills to help ease the 
flow of traffic to and from areas such as the Warner Center and Calabasas.

A 16-year-old Huntington Beach High School student died Sunday night when the 
motorcycle on which she was a passenger hit a car, police said. Leslie Groosman 
died instantly in the 10:39 p.m. accident on Pacific Coast Highway, north of 
Warner Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Groosman nor the driver of the motorcycle, Scott Melnyzok, 18, was 
wearing a helmet, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Melnyzok was treated for a concussion and cuts at Fountain Valley Community 
Hospital, then taken to Orange County Jail, where he was booked on suspicion of 
manslaughter and felony drunk driving. The driver of the car, Randy Seymour, 
32, of Garden Grove, was uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour said he did not see other vehicles around him before the accident 
occurred. "It's like they came out of nowhere," he said. "When I pulled over, I 
still didn't know what hit me." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach High Principal Gary Ernst announced Groosman's death to 
students at 11:30 a.m. today.

TUSTIN GROUP WINS TOLLWAY STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The agency overseeing planning for the Eastern tollway has agreed to conduct 
new noise and air quality studies in the Peters Canyon area in order to settle 
a homeowners' environmental lawsuit against the planned traffic project. 
</P>
<P>
Filed in July by the Tustin Hills Homeowners Coalition, the lawsuit alleged 
that the environmental impact report approved by the Board of Supervisors last 
year was inadequate because it did not detail homeowners' exposure to expected 
increases in noise and air pollution once the tollway is open to traffic in the 
mid- to late 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The Foothill-Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency, which is supervising the 
tollway project, and the homeowners group have accepted the terms of the 
settlement, but county officials are still processing the paper work and have 
not approved it, according to Donna Stubbs, the corridor agency's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the settlement, neither the county nor the corridor agency 
admits any wrongdoing, but they agree to pay for the new noise and air quality 
studies aimed at comparing existing noise and air pollution levels with what 
will occur once the tollway opens -- using worst-case traffic scenarios.

SNOWFALL BLANKETS MISSOURI, STORM CRIPPLES TRAVEL

<P>
A late winter storm dumped 14 inches of snow on Missouri today and plowed into 
the Eastern Seaboard, icing over highways from Texas to New York City and 
crippling ground travel for beleaguered businessmen and tourists already 
frustrated by an airline strike. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service said the storm -- coming just two weeks before the 
start of spring -- as among the worst to hit Missouri in this century. 
</P>

Hundreds of police today broke up a protest by demonstrators seeking greater 
access to state-run media in the Baltic capital of Riga, tearing down banners 
and arresting 30 people, an activist said. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of protesters gathered in front of Communist Party Central Committee 
headquarters in Riga to protest restrictions on Latvian state television, said 
Boris Sokolov, a member of the Democratic Union, an independent political 
party. Access to television is considered especially important because of the 
nationwide campaign before March 26 elections to the Council of People's 
Deputies, a new national assembly that is to choose the country's president and 
the Supreme Soviet (Parliament).

Police in suburban Quezon City said today that they have already hauled into 
jail about 300 violators of a tough anti-smoking law that took effect a day 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested were locked in holding cells until charges could be prepared 
against them. After a few hours, they were released pending trial. 
</P>
<P>
The dragnet snagged not only scofflaws but also unwitting violators. 
</P>
<P>
One 19-year-old youth arrived today at the police station, puffing on a 
cigarette, carrying food for a friend arrested earlier for unauthorized 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager was thrown into the cell with his friend after police explained 
the smoking ban applies in police stations too. 
</P>
<P>
The new ordinance bans smoking in most public places, including buses, 
restaurants, government offices, hospitals and theaters in the city of about 1 
million, part of metropolitan Manila. 
</P>
<P>
Violators who smoke in public places that are not designated for smoking face a 
$10 fine or 10 days in jail or both. 
</P>
<P>
"No complaints so far," said Col. Rodolfo Garcia, police station commander and 
a reformed smoker, speaking about the crackdown. "The people are even pleased 
because we are protecting them."

The Supreme Court, in a case stemming from Delta Air Lines' takeover of Western 
Air Lines, today refused to let Delta force the retirement of a group of flight 
engineers over age 60. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that Delta is bound by an 
age-bias lawsuit the flight engineers won against Western. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge in California ordered Western in 1981 to abandon its mandatory 
retirement age of 60 for flight engineers. The judge also permitted pilots to 
bid for flight engineer jobs when they approached 60, the retirement age for 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
That ruling stemmed from a suit by 15 flight engineers who accused Western of 
violating the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act aimed at protecting 
older workers.

Authorities today arrested the former chairman of Nippon Telegraph &amp; 
Telephone Corp. on suspicion of bribery in a stock-profiteering scandal that 
has shaken Japan's political and business elite. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo District Prosecutor's Office said Hisashi Shinto, 78, was arrested 
with his 63-year-old secretary, Kozo Murata, on suspicion of receiving bribes 
in the form of bargain-price shares in a subsidiary of the Recruit Co., a 
conglomerate with business links to the giant telecommunications utility. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities also said they searched Shinto's home. 
</P>
<P>
Shinto was known as an advocate of clean government and business until 
December, when he was forced to resign from the chairmanship of NTT as a result 
of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Today's arrests follow the announcement Saturday that prosecutors in the case 
had indicted four people on bribery charges, including the founder of the 
Recruit Co., another Recruit executive and two former NTT officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Recruit figures were indicted on charges of offering bribes, and the former 
NTT officials were accused of accepting bribes.

Increases in home prices and mortgage interest rates cut into home buyers' 
purchasing power in January, the National Assn. of Realtors said today. 
</P>
<P>
The realtors' housing affordability index for January was 108, down from 111.2 
in December. At 108, the index means a family earning the January median income 
of $32,207 had 108% of the income needed to qualify for a conventional loan 
covering 80% of a home priced at $91,500, the median price the association 
recorded for existing single-family homes in January.

<P>
Management and union representatives of reporters, janitors and other Los 
Angeles Herald Examiner employees reached a tentative agreement today on a new 
labor contract, averting a possible walkout. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after talks that began Sunday afternoon and continued 
until 5 a.m. today, said John Chandler, a Herald reporter and spokesman for the 
Graphic Communications Union, which represents 500 of the paper's 800 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler said that details of the tentative pact could not be released 
immediately and that workers affected by it would have terms explained to them 
during the day. 
</P>
<P>
"People are being told to report to work this morning. . . . There will be a 
meeting (Tuesday) morning, and the bargaining committee and the union will 
recommend that the rank and file accept the contract," Chandler said. He said 
the contract will be voted upon at the same meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Employees sought salaries closer to those paid at their sister newspaper in the 
Hearst organization, the San Francisco Examiner. Top-scale Herald reporters 
receive $563 a week contrasted with $801 a week for Examiner reporters.

night that Reed had agreed to a one-year contract. Terms were not announced, 
but Reed will receive a reported $175,000. Reed, 26, replaced veteran Spike 
Owen after the All-Star break last year and helped the Red Sox to the American

University of Oklahoma athletic officials said they have not yet decided what 
action to take after basketball player Mookie Blaylock's arrest early Sunday 
for alleged public intoxication. "We're in the process of determining the facts 
and at this point we have not been able to do that," Athletic Director Donnie 
Duncan said Sunday. "I think we'll be able to reach a decision sometime in the 
morning (today)." Mike Prusinski, a spokesman for the basketball team, said 
university offices were closed today because of a winter snowstorm that hit the 
state. He was not sure how that would affect efforts to make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Blaylock, a starting guard on the No. 4 Oklahoma basketball team, was arrested 
shortly after 4 a.m. Sunday and booked into Cleveland County Jail on a 
municipal public drunkenness complaint, Police Sgt. Olan Nystrom said. He said 
a convenience store employee called police to the store because Blaylock was 
arguing with a female companion. Blaylock, 21, was released on bond and is 
expected to appear next week in municipal court.

OLYMPIC BOXER ROY JONES STILL SEEKING 1ST PRO FIGHT

<P>
Roy Jones, frustrated by the judges who deprived him of Olympic gold at the 
1988 Olympics, is now feeling a different kind of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to get my first professional fight lined up, and I've learned it's 
not easy getting started," Jones said today. 
</P>
<P>
Jones is the only one of this year's 10 Sullivan Award finalists to leave the 
Olympics without a gold medal in 1988. The award, to be announced tonight, is 
given to the nation's top amateur athlete. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, of Pensacola, Fla., the youngest member of the U.S. boxing team at 19, 
lost a controversial 3-2 decision to South Korean Si-Hun in the gold medal bout 
at Seoul. Most ringside observers thought Jones dominated the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I was still bitter about the decision when I returned to the United States. 
Even though I was selected the top boxer at the Olympics (by the International 
Amateur Boxing Assn.), I kept asking myself, if I was the top boxer, how come I 
didn't have the gold medal?" Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Had Been Robbed' 
</P>
<P>
"But, then when I came back to the United States, I found so many people who 
supported me, told me how I had been robbed, that I realized the people in this 
country felt I was the Olympic champion and that was why I went to the 
Olympics, to represent this country and be a champion for it." 
</P>
<P>
Battling back is nothing new to Jones, who lost to Frank Liles at the U.S. 
Amateur Championships last year and then had to defeat him both at the Olympic 
trials and Olympic box-offs to earn a trip to Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Florence Griffith Joyner, who won three Olympic gold medals and set two world 
records last year, is considered the favorite to win the Sullivan Award, 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner, 29, of Los Angeles, announced her retirement from track on 
Feb. 25. She already has been recognized the Sportswoman of the Year by the 
U.S. Olympic Committee and the winner of the Jesse Owens International Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
Other contenders for the Sullivan Award are swimmers Matt Biondi of Moraga, 
Calif., and Janet Evans of Placentia, kayaker Greg Barton of Newport Beach; 
speed skater Bonnie Blair of Champaign, Ill.; figure skater Brian Boitano of 
Sunnyvale; captain of the U.S. Olympic volleyball team Karch Kiraly of San 
Diego; basketball player Katrina McClain of Charleston, S.C., and wrestler John 
Smith of Del City, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will be announced tonight by Don Lash, 76, who won the coveted award 
in 1938 after finishing second the previous year. Lash, who won a record seven 
consecutive national cross-country championships, was asked to make the 
presentation in recognition of the 50th anniversary of his selection.

Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson took a banned anabolic steroid 21 days prior to 
his failed Olympic drug test, but not the one he tested positive for after 
winning the 100 meters, his coach told a Canadian government inquiry today. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying under oath for a fourth day in the inquiry into drug use in amateur 
sports, Charlie Francis was asked whether some of his athletes were on a 
steroids program prior to the Seoul Games in September. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, they were. Ben Johnson, Angella Issajenko, Mark McKoy, Tracy Smith and 
Desai Williams," he said, adding the drug program was designed by Dr. Mario 
(Jamie) Astaphan. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Astaphan) was very concerned with the soreness in (Johnson's) tendon and 
felt this would help heal the injury and speed up the recovery process," 
Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Steroid 
</P>
<P>
Francis said the steroid Johnson took on Sept. 2, the last he took before the 
Olympics, was furazabol, not stanozolol, the steroid that was allegedly found 
in his urine at Seoul. Francis said he did not believe Johnson received any 
steroids between the time the sprinter left Canada on Sept. 6 up to the day of 
his race in Seoul on Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was stripped of his Olympic 100-meter gold medal after testing positive 
for the banned drug. 
</P>
<P>
Francis conceded it was risky for the athletes to be taking banned drugs so 
close to the Seoul Games and a pre-Olympic competition in Tokyo on Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a little unusual as to the time of year to give them that many 
injections. But in light of the fact Dr. Astaphan had been on the money in 
terms of recommendations before I felt it was an acceptable program," he said. 
Francis has testified that Astaphan had received $10,000 a month to help 
Johnson prepare for the biggest race of his career. 
</P>
<P>
The coach said his athletes also took diuretics to help minimize the 
possibility of detection. 
</P>
<P>
Francis said Johnson, who has repeatedly denied he knowingly took steroids, had 
a "page of instructions as to what he was going to take on each day provided by 
Dr. Astaphan." 
</P>
<P>
The coach said Johnson began using a variety of steroids, which were usually 
taken for 14 weeks a year, beginning in 1981.
