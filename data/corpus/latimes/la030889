WESTMINSTER SCHOOL TAX REJECTED OVERWHELMINGLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly rejected a $100-per-parcel tax that would have 
restored more than $900,000 in budget cuts to the Westminster School District. 
</P>
<P>
The vote, with all precincts reporting but without the absentee count, was 
3,227 against the tax and 1,119 in favor. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Nancy Blumenthal said: "I guess people don't want to contribute 
to the educational future of their children. And this tax just came to about 30 
cents a day." Without the added revenue, she said, parents can expect "more 
program cuts." 
</P>
<P>
A disappointed Supt. Barney Davis said the money would have been used to repair 
or replace old heaters, leaking roofs and 30-year-old furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, Davis said he had misgivings that the tax, titled Measure A, 
would get the necessary two-thirds vote, especially if voter turnout was low. 
</P>
<P>
The tax would have cost a maximum of $100 per residential parcel and $200 for 
each business. If passed, Measure A would have terminated in 10 years. While in 
effect, it would have allowed the school board to impose the tax each year, up 
to the $100 and $200 maximums, depending on the district's financial need. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster would have joined about 80 California school districts that have 
passed special taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Like other struggling school districts, Davis said, Westminster suffers from 
declining enrollment, on which state income is based. At the same time, 
insurance rates and the cost of labor, equipment and building maintenance 
continue to increase. 
</P>
<P>
"The costs were proportionately greater than our income, creating a situation 
where the district cannot compete for employee salaries anymore," Davis said. 
Although the new tax money would not have been used for raises, it would have 
allowed the district to use other money to help pay teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Some who cast ballots expressed anger about the tax, calling it unfair to 
people without children or an indication of district mismanagement. Others 
argued that the district should have held the election last November, thereby 
saving an estimated $40,000 in election costs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'What About Lottery Funds?' 
</P>
<P>
"The main reason I voted no was because I thought there was enough tax money 
coming out of the state to support schools. And what about all these (state) 
lottery funds?" asked Ron Hughes of Garden Grove after voting against the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
Only 3% of Westminster's $25-million annual budget comes from the lottery, 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
The Westminster School District serves 7,500 students with 13 elementary and 
three middle schools in Garden Grove, Huntington Beach and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
District officials had hoped that a series of advance meetings and campaign 
flyers would result in a large voter turnout of interested parents. But only a 
fraction of approximatedly 30,000 registered voters went to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually get a very low turnout when we only have one item to vote on, as we 
do in this case," said precinct inspector Alma Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Verhague, a 20-year resident of Garden Grove, said that until Tuesday he 
had never voted against a school measure. 
</P>
<P>
"But I just don't think they're using what they have in the way of funds 
efficiently," Verhague said. 
</P>
<P>
Keah Clairmont, a mother of two boys, was among those who supported the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Minimal Amount' 
</P>
<P>
"This $100 tax is a minimal amount, and we as homeowners won't feel the 
increase at all due to our increasing property values," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But John Ward, who is single and a homeowner, said he was "emphatically 
against" Tuesday's measure because he was a supporter of Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
"We had all those pro-education measures on the ballot in November and that 
really hurt single homeowners and the elderly. Measure A is just another kick 
in the pants for us taxpayers," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
The intent of Proposition 13, Howard Jarvis' anti-property tax initiative, was 
first challenged in Orange County in 1983, when voters in the Irvine Unified 
School District defeated a ballot measure that would have imposed a tax of $50 
per parcel. A year later, voters in the La Habra City School District also 
rejected a tax measure. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster officials sought to impose Tuesday's levy as a "special tax," which 
Proposition 13 authorizes on condition of approval by two-thirds of voters, 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the district receives $2,558 per student from the state, less than 
most of the 13 Orange County elementary school districts. Cypress receives 
about $286 more per student. 
</P>
<P>
Some Westminster school buildings are in disrepair, he said, and the purchase 
of badly needed furniture and other equipment has been deferred. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a better system of school finance in this state. We're limited by what 
we can do to get it, and limited in the amount we get," Davis said.

MAXICARE TO CLOSE HMO UNIT IN ORANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Maxicare Health Plans Inc. said Tuesday that it is closing Family Health 
Services Inc., its 55,000-member health maintenance organization based in 
Orange, effective at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
FHS, which was acquired by Maxicare in 1986 when it bought HealthCare USA, 
operates 15 medical clinics under the FHS and General Med names in Orange, Los 
Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare said it is notifying members, employers and health care providers of 
the planned closing so they can make alternative arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Because FHS is a self-contained unit providing services directly, its members 
will not automatically be covered by other Maxicare plans. Those members will 
have to enroll in other medical plans offered by their employers. The number of 
Orange County Maxicare members was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest impact of the closing will be in Orange County, where seven 
clinics operate under the General Med name. Of the 500 FHS employees to be laid 
off with the closing, about 300 work in Orange County, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Maxicare, which is in the middle of a financial restructuring 
that may be critical to its survival, said closing FHS is part of that broad 
program. The restructuring has included selling unprofitable plans. 
</P>
<P>
However, the company said it is dismantling FHS because it could not sell the 
unit, despite 9 months of intense effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked to a lot of people, but the deals were never consummated," said Tobi 
Nyberg, vice president for corporate communications. 
</P>
<P>
FHS has some assets, including buildings and medical equipment, that can be 
sold, but Maxicare expects the net effect of the closure to be a loss, Nyberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, Maxicare does not provide medical care directly but contracts 
with independent health care providers for services. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare said it is encouraging employers to hold special open enrollments so 
FHS members will have access to alternative services immediately after March 
31, when FHS clinics stop seeing patients. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of FHS employees will remain for a few months to handle 
administrative tasks, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were concerned that Family Health Services' financial condition could 
affect its ability to deliver quality health care for its members," said Harley 
Blankenship, Maxicare's executive vice president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
The closure will also help Maxicare meet its goal "to cut debt and losses so we 
can pay provider claims on a timely basis," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which has had huge losses in the last 2 years, has said it must 
improve its payments schedule for contractors to preserve crucial 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate announcement Tuesday, Maxicare said it changed financial advisers 
for the recapitalization plan. The company said it "concluded its agreement" 
with Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., the New York investment banking firm hired last 
fall to help devise the plan, and instead hired Oppenheimer &amp; Co. for 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare's board authorized New York-based Oppenheimer to "immediately review 
strategic alternatives, including financing alternatives and additional asset 
sales," said a Maxicare company statement. 
</P>
<P>
Blankenship would not specify the reasons for changing advisers but said 
Goldman Sachs' departure was by "mutual agreement." Goldman Sachs declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Selwitz, an analyst with Cruttenden &amp; Co., a Newport Beach investment 
banking firm, said the change in advisers was a surprise. "I don't consider 
this kind of a deal a great sign," Selwitz said. "This is especially disturbing 
when you are talking about a situation where doing something expedient is 
really critical. This restructuring should have gone ahead before now." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect the recapitalization to involve converting the company's debt 
into equity. "The question is whether there is going to be a long haggling over 
how much equity for debt," Selwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is surprised that the company has not tried to communicate with its 
senior creditors and bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
"To get this thing off and running, the company has to take the first step and 
go to the bondholders. This is a very critical step to the restructuring," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said in December that they expected to announce a plan in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
However, Blankenship said Tuesday that the recapitalization plan is on schedule 
and that no further delays are expected as a result of changing advisers. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not be surprised if we may be in a position to make an announcement 
next week," he said, although he noted that the company has not yet approached 
bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare needs to recapitalize because it cannot meet interest payments due its 
bondholders and a group of banks holding about $150 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
The banks have given Maxicare some "breathing room," Blankenship said, by 
agreeing to a 120-day standstill that allowed Maxicare to use funds to pay 
providers. When the agreement expires April 1, he said, "we expect continuing 
our obligations to the banks."

CITIZEN OF YEAR MOLESTED BOYS

A Galt civic leader and scoutmaster has admitted that he molested eight boys 
and punished some of them by making them stand naked, according to court 
documents. Allen Lee Trueman, 42, pleaded no contest to eight felony charges 
when he was arraigned in Sacramento Municipal Court. A carpenter, who was named 
Galt's Citizen of the Year in 1988 for his volunteer work, Trueman initially 
denied molesting the 8- to 14-year-old boys in his home. But court records said 
he later told investigators he had bathed some of the boys, tickled their 
genitals and made them stand naked when they misbehaved. "I do what I do 
because I'm searching for satisfaction," police quoted Trueman as saying. "When 
I'm helping the boys, I need to feel needed and loved in return." Trueman told 
police he is dropping out of all Scout activities.

NEWSMAKERS: KITTY DUKAKIS' HOMECOMING: WARMED-OVER LASAGNA

<P>
A smiling Kitty Dukakis, wife of Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, 
returned to her Brookline, Mass., home after a monthlong stay at a Rhode Island 
clinic for treatment of alcohol abuse. "Doesn't she look terrific," the 
governor said as he and his wife emerged from a car driven by her father, Harry 
Ellis Dickson. Asked what was the best part of returning home, Mrs. Dukakis 
said: "Being with my husband." Without missing a beat, her husband added: 
"Being with my wife." Mrs. Dukakis, 52, had been in Edgehill Newport, an 
intensive residential facility, since Feb. 5. The governor and his wife planned 
a quiet day at home, with Dukakis capping off the homecoming by reheating a 
lasagna dinner prepared by a friend. In a statement, Dukakis expressed 
gratitude for the public support for his wife. While in treatment, Mrs. Dukakis 
received about 5,000 letters, including good wishes from First Lady Barbara 
Bush, Nancy Reagan and Betty Ford. Mrs. Dukakis had revealed during her 
husband's campaign that she had earlier conquered a 26-year addiction to diet 
pills. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the other side of the world, the wife of another political figure was in 
the news when the official Soviet news agency gave rare coverage to Raisa 
Gorbachev. "If people currently are more confident of a peaceful future, we 
know that much of the credit goes to women actively working on all continents 
for friendship, cooperation and profound mutual understanding of nations," Tass 
reported the Kremlin First Lady as saying at a reception she gave in honor of 
International Women's Day, a Soviet holiday that will be celebrated today. 
Although Mrs. Gorbachev is shown frequently on Soviet state-run television and 
has been interviewed by Western reporters, her views are rarely reported in 
Soviet media. Not to be outdone by his wife, Mikhail S. Gorbachev also made 
headlines. The Communist Party youth daily Komsomolets Tadzhikistan said he has 
donated $82,000 from the U.S. sales of his book "Perestroika" to the 
Tadzhikistan earthquake fund. The paper from the central Asian republic 
reported that the money will go for rebuilding homes and public buildings in 
three villages devastated in a Jan. 23 earthquake and subsequent mudslide. 
About 280 people were killed. SHIRLEY MARLOW

LAWMAKER FAULTS BUSH DRUG WAR POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Select Committee on 
Narcotics, charged that President Bush has failed to make the war on drugs a 
priority in the nation's foreign policy and has sown confusion among South 
American leaders. Fresh from a meeting in Ecuador with more than 200 officials 
from five Andean nations, the congressman said it was "embarrassing" to talk 
with his South American counterparts about the U.S. commitment to battling 
drugs. "They want leadership from Bush -- they are pushing for a drug summit," 
he said. Rangel said the Bush Administration continues to treat the fight 
against drugs almost exclusively as a law enforcement problem when it should be 
at the top of the foreign policy agenda. The Administration is still not 
prepared to use discussions on restructuring Latin American debt, as well as on 
military aid, to press for pledges from South American governments to wipe out 
drug production, he said.

Nearly 20,000 Israeli militants, led by armed settlers from the occupied West 
Bank, demonstrated in Tel Aviv in favor of renewed Jewish settlement in the 
occupied territories. Amid the regular evening traffic jams, protesters drove 
three flatbed trucks carrying prefabricated houses that they said would be the 
nucleus of a new settlement near the Arab West Bank town of Ramallah. However, 
organizers said settlement will begin only when official authorization is 
received -- before the end of the week, they hope.

Four-term socialist Mayor Bernard Sanders' party won another victory in 
Burlington, Vt., as former community development director Peter Clavelle 
defeated Alderman Nancy Chioffi to become Sanders' successor. Clavelle, the 
Progressive Coalition candidate, had 5,626 ballots, or 52% of the vote, to 
4,400, or 41%, for Democrat Chioffi, a store owner who also had Republican 
backing, according to unofficial results. Sanders -- often billed as the 
nation's only socialist mayor -- had decided against another term.

Terrorist organizations seem certain to eventually acquire chemical, biological 
and even nuclear weapons, a conference in Stockholm was told. "It's not a 
question of 'if' but of 'when' it will happen. It's just a matter of time," 
said Yonah Alexander, director of the Institute for Studies in International 
Terrorism at the State University of New York. "We have to face the danger that 
a terrorist incident could provoke a nuclear confrontation, and both the United 
States and Soviet Union are aware of this," he said.

STATE DELEGATION LOBBIES CONGRESS AGAINST CUTS IN MEDICATE PAYMENTS

<P>
A delegation of county supervisors from California lobbied Congress 
Tuesdayagainst President Bush's proposed cuts in Medicare payments to 
hospitals, arguing that their health "safety nets" for the needy already are 
strained by a lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
The 150 county officials also said that they oppose Bush's plan to reduce mass 
transit subsidies and impose a 20% cut in U.S. payments to the counties for 
timber logged on federal lands inside their borders. 
</P>
<P>
They told members of California's congressional delegation that they oppose 
earmarking of any possible increase in the federal gasoline tax for deficit 
reduction. They said that they favor placing any added gas tax money in the 
highway trust fund for the benefit of motorists. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Coates, a Plumas County supervisor who heads the County Supervisors Assn. 
of California, said that the counties have been asked to provide more services, 
while federal aid for many programs has been reduced sharply in the last 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
"With the recent demise of general revenue sharing, California counties 
overnight lost $250 million a year in discretionary funds desperately needed," 
he said at a news conference. "Our message to Washington is clear. California 
counties are struggling with an unrelenting fiscal crisis. . . . Give us the 
money and the flexibility to serve our people." 
</P>
<P>
Coates said county hospitals often are the last resort for recent immigrants 
and residents without health insurance. "Unfortunately, we've got so many folks 
landing in our safety net (that) we can't support the load," he said. "If we 
don't take care of them, they're going to die. The worst job in the world is 
trying to run a safety net without any money." 
</P>
<P>
Madge Schaefer, a Ventura County supervisor, said that elected officiaals often 
must reduce law enforcement budgets to preserve health care for the needy, 
making a daunting choice between "cops or docs." 
</P>
<P>
Willie Kennedy, a San Francisco county supervisor, said that the costs of 
caring for AIDS patients, the homeless and the mentally ill are mounting while 
the federal government is considering reductions in its assistance for many 
programs. "If we have to cut services, the county supervisors will get the 
blame," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Shipnuck, a Monterey County supervisor, said that Bush's proposed 
reduction in Medicare's reimbursement rate for hospitals and a cut in U.S. 
payments for graduate medical education would hurt the standards of medical 
care. 
</P>
<P>
Coates said that the county officials presented their views to members of the 
California congressional delegation and expressed "grave concern" over 
financial problems at the local level, noting: "There's more talk about revenue 
sources. Personally, I don't think there's any way they can run all the things 
they want to run without a tax increase." 
</P>
<P>
But Larry Naake, the state supervisor group's executive director, said that the 
Californians strongly oppose a proposal floated by Chairman Dan Rostenkowski 
(D-Ill.) of the House Ways and Means Committee to raise the federal gasoline 
tax by 10 cents or 15 cents a gallon to reduce the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
A consensus appears to be developing in California on a $20 billion package for 
highway repair, he said, including a state gasoline tax increase from 5 cents 
to 10 cents a gallon. A federal gas tax increase atop that would be especially 
unwelcome, he said.

BERGESON INTRODUCES 6 MEASURES TO DEAL WITH GROWTH ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Saying she wants to respond to California's "growth revolt," state Sen. Marian 
Bergeson on Tuesday introduced six bills that she said would help the state 
continue to grow while minimizing traffic congestion and pollution and 
maximizing the supply of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
The package, which will probably be the Legislature's most comprehensive 
attempt this year to deal with the problems of growth, includes bills aimed at 
transportation, housing and planning issues, some from a statewide perspective 
and others pointed directly at Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson, a Republican from Newport Beach, said her legislation is the product 
of about 6 months of study, during which she met with nearly 100 advisers and 
held a special hearing to consider the views of the state's business community 
and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Root Causes' of Poor Planning 
</P>
<P>
"The people are rebelling against the effects of poor planning," Bergeson said. 
"What we're trying to do is address the root causes of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation leaves untouched the existing authority of local governments to 
approve developments without consulting one another or deferring to broader 
needs dictated by county or regional agencies. 
</P>
<P>
But the bills would adjust the current relationships among local, regional and 
state agencies when it comes to planning for growth and allocating money for 
transportation, housing, water and sewer projects. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's possible, politically or structurally, to make dramatic 
changes," Bergeson said. "I think you have to gain an understanding of what 
you're trying to do, and then you have to pull by consensus. I believe in local 
government." 
</P>
<P>
One of Bergeson's bills would establish new priorities for transportation 
funding, giving preference to counties and cities that promote better use of 
existing highways. 
</P>
<P>
The same measure would allow counties to take over building state highways if 
the California Transportation Commission determined that it had fallen 
hopelessly behind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Meaning for Housing Plans 
</P>
<P>
That bill and another measure would also give new meaning to the housing plans 
that cities and counties are required to prepare. Under the legislation, the 
plans, many of which now do little more than gather dust on bookshelves, would 
be used by the state as the basis for handing out bond proceeds for building 
water and sewer projects and highways. 
</P>
<P>
Local governments found to have unacceptable growth controls could be placed at 
the end of the line for state money. 
</P>
<P>
That approach was tried in several legislative forms last year, none of which 
succeeded, in the face of heavy opposition from the slow-growth movement. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Martin, a leader of Save California, a statewide slow-growth coalition, 
said she is skeptical about the transportation proposal, which she fears will 
give the state more leverage over local governments that impose growth 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to look at most of these things with a bit of a cynical eye," Martin 
said. "Most of the efforts to come out of Sacramento have been designed pretty 
much to thwart the local initiative, the local effort to keep growth management 
in the community's hands." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Tax Developments 
</P>
<P>
Another Bergeson measure would remove laws that now block cities and counties 
from sharing certain tax money. Bergeson said the bill is aimed at reducing the 
incentive that cities have to approve developments to maximize their tax 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most controversial measure in the package from a local standpoint 
is Bergeson's second bid in 2 years to deal with tensions between Orange County 
and the Southern California Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would abolish SCAG, a 6-county regional planning body, as it now 
exists and create a new, similar agency with fewer powers. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed structure would give Orange County more money and authority to 
devise its own transportation plans. Bergeson called Tuesday's version of the 
bill a "rough draft." 
</P>
<P>
"The current system is just not working," Bergeson said. "There hasn't been the 
confidence in SCAG. This is an effort to try to let Orange County get a handle 
on how it can plan within the county and then fit that plan into a regional 
context." 
</P>
<P>
But Gil Smith, director of legislative affairs for SCAG, said the measure would 
fractionalize planning in Southern California just when increased regional 
planning is needed. 
</P>
<P>
"In Southern California, you can't identify the county lines, let alone the 
city lines," he said. "The Orange County-Los Angeles area -- with the tie 
between the major airports, the harbors, the dynamic growth -- doesn't afford 
the opportunity for independent county planning." 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Smith linked Orange County's longstanding resistance to a major 
expansion of John Wayne Airport with the fact that 30% of the traffic at Los 
Angeles International Airport is created by Orange County residents and 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Oftelie, executive director of the Orange County Transportation 
Commission, said Bergeson's approach meshes well with what the county 
commission has advocated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Bottoms-Up Approach' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bottoms-up approach that will work better than the current system," he 
said. "I am sure you will find that this has the support of many local 
government officials outside of Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
General reaction to the package Tuesday could only be described as cautious. 
Irvine Co. Vice President Larry Thomas said the firm, which has close ties to 
Bergeson, could not comment until it had seen the final version of the bills. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra Club lobbyist Paula Carrell also declined to comment, except to predict 
that any bid to "tinker" with the system would fall short of lasting 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Nestande, the former state assemblyman and county supervisor who now 
works for a developer and is a member of the state Transportation Commission, 
said the package may not be much help without an infusion of new money for 
building roads, sewers and other public works projects. 
</P>
<P>
"What we may be doing here is nothing more than rearranging the deck chairs on 
the Titanic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'This Is All Just Talk' 
</P>
<P>
"As general statements, they sound nice, but the real issue is a revenue 
shortage. If you don't have the money to build the infrastructure, this is all 
just talk, and we are avoiding the real issue." 
</P>
<P>
But Bergeson described her package as a "first-step effort." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that from an overall perspective, each one of these bills represents a 
major area that has to be addressed," she said. "Obviously, there's much more 
to be done. But I'm heartened by the interest in the Legislature and in local 
government in looking at an issue that is going to be the predominant factor in 
deciding our quality of life in the 21st Century."

CHANGE OF VENUE SOUGHT FOR HUNTER; 
</P>
<P>
LAWYERS SAY FAIR TRIAL IN J. DAVID CASE IMPOSSIBLE IN S.D. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Citing "slanted, adverse and prejudicial publicity" in San Diego, lawyers for 
Nancy Hoover Hunter asked Tuesday that she be tried in San Jose on fraud, 
conspiracy and income tax evasion charges stemming from the collapse of the J. 
David &amp; Co. investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
"In this jurisdiction, the overwhelming evidence is that we will not get a fair 
and impartial jury," said Robert S. Brewer, one of Hunter's lawyers. He called 
the motion for a change of venue "the most serious and important issue in this 
case." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One of Two Pending Cases 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam, who rejected a similar motion in the case 
nearly two years ago, said he will rule on the issue again today. Hunter's 
trial is scheduled to begin March 28. 
</P>
<P>
The case, filed in November, 1986, is one of two pending against Hunter, who 
was second-in-command at the La Jolla investment firm headed by J. David 
(Jerry) Dominelli, her live-in companion at the time. She has since married 
Kenneth Hunter, a wealthy businessman, and lives in Montecito, an affluent 
community near Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1986 case, Hunter, the former mayor of Del Mar, was charged with 234 
counts of fraud, conspiracy and income tax evasion stemming from her 
involvement with the once-glamorous firm. In March, 1988, Hunter was indicted 
again by a federal grand jury on 56 counts of conspiracy and using the mails to 
sell unregistered securities. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate, state case, Hunter pleaded guilty in April, 1986, to charges of 
conspiracy to funnel thousands of dollars into Roger Hedgecock's 1983 mayoral 
campaign. She was sentenced to three years' probation, ordered to perform 350 
hours of community service and fined $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Brewer argued Tuesday that Hunter has been portrayed negatively in the San 
Diego press since 1983, when stories began to appear alleging irregularities at 
J. David. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to worry about six years of publicity and what it does to a person's 
ability to be unbiased and fair," Brewer said. Hunter's name was mentioned 
frequently in stories over the past six years each time there was a development 
in either Hedgecock's or Dominelli's criminal case, Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawyers Requested Poll 
</P>
<P>
A poll done in January at the request of Hunter's lawyers showed that 55% of 
300 people sampled by telephone in San Diego recognized Hunter's name, Brewer 
said. Of those who recognized her name, 65% knew she had been indicted, he 
added, and of those who said they were aware of the criminal case, 28.6% 
thought Hunter was guilty. In contrast, only 4.6% of 300 people polled in San 
Jose even recognized Hunter's name, he said. "The people in San Jose could care 
less about this case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Further, a defense analysis showed that San Diego news stories were 
"overwhelmingly slanted against Nancy Hunter," portraying her as "capricious," 
"greedy" and "excessive," Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U. S. Atty. Gay Hugo argued against moving the trial and said that, 
even if the defense opinion poll is accurate, Hunter can still get a fair trial 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pure speculation as to whether this community or prospective jurors are 
so tainted" that they cannot give Hunter a fair trial, Hugo said. She said the 
correct time to determine the issue is during jury selection, when prospective 
jurors can be questioned, under oath, about possible biases.

STOPPING ON HARBOR BOULEVARD BANNED; 
</P>
<P>
NEW TACTIC IS AIMED AT SANTA ANA HOOKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER L. CHIN, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Ana has finally hit on tactics designed to cut down on prostitution on 
heavily traveled Harbor Boulevard that even the ACLU, traditionally a foe on 
the issue, approves. 
</P>
<P>
Parking and stopping cars will be prohibited along Harbor from 4 p.m. to 9 
a.m., the period when streetwalkers generally solicit business. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very different from what they (city officials) tried to do earlier, which 
was to ban people from the streets," said Rebecca Jurado, an attorney with the 
American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"Courts have held on numerous occasions that it is within the cities' authority 
to deal with traffic problems," she said. "What they (city officials) tried to 
do before was beyond their authority." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted 5 to 0 Monday night to bar stopping at night on Harbor 
Boulevard between Warner and Westminster avenues, according to City Atty. 
Edward J. Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
The council was responding to pleas from merchants and residents, who have long 
complained about prostitutes flagging down cars and soliciting business along 
the boulevard at all hours. 
</P>
<P>
Police say Harbor Boulevard is a regular stop for professional prostitutes 
known as "circuit girls" who travel from city to city seeking out busy 
thoroughfares in high-income areas. Authorities say Harbor became popular after 
the 1984 Olympics and has been on the circuit ever since. 
</P>
<P>
When the professional "circuit girls" are in town, police say it is not unusual 
for 30 to 40 prostitutes to gather on one street corner on Harbor Boulevard, 
brazenly shouting and waving at passing vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Fast-food merchants along Harbor have complained that prostitutes often hide 
from police in their restaurants and scare other customers away. Homeowners who 
live just off Harbor have complained of finding condoms and syringes in their 
front yards. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, the city attorney, said the resolution also was designed to relieve 
traffic congestion caused by men stopping and picking up the women. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who violates the parking restrictions between those hours will get a 
citation, whether it is to solicit a prostitute or for business purposes," 
Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
No-stopping signs will be installed March 15, and the regulation will be 
enforced for the first time about March 25, said Ruth Smith, an associate 
traffic engineer with the city's Public Works Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said violators are subject to a $30 fine, plus an added court-assessed 
penalty that could exceed $33. It will cost the city about $6,000 to post the 
80 no-stopping signs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution was proposed jointly by the police and the Public Works Agency 
and is the latest effort to fight prostitution and traffic problems on Harbor 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Along with police, Cooper said his office is considering other proposals to 
relieve the problems, but he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
In February, an Orange County Superior Court judge rejected a city plan to 
declare more than a hundred prostitution suspects public nuisances and bar them 
from Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Under the rejected plan, women suspected of repeated prostitution would have 
faced -- in addition to criminal penalties -- a ban on appearing within 100 
yards of problem spots along Harbor. Anyone violating the ban would have been 
jailed for contempt of court and be assessed with civil fines of up to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU argued successfully that such a ban would violate the U.S. 
Constitution. While sympathizing with the city, the presiding judge in the case 
said that to impose an all-out ban on people suspected of prostitution was 
tantamount to asserting that "every attractive woman on Harbor Boulevard is 
assumed to be a hooker." 
</P>
<P>
The no-stopping rule apparently did not draw opposition. Police Department 
spokesman Bob Chavez said the department handed out flyers announcing a 
community meeting in January, but nobody showed up. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Graham, an employee at a Baskin-Robbins store in the affected area, 
favors the proposal.

OPOSSUM DIES, BABIES SAVED

<P>
The drama began to unfold about 6:30 a.m. Tuesday in the center divider of 
northbound Interstate 5 near El Toro Road. 
</P>
<P>
There, as stalled motorists watched in fascination, an unidentified man got out 
of his 4-wheel-drive Bronco and tried to stand in front of an injured young 
opossum so that it wouldn't bolt into traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The man was soon joined by California Highway Patrol Officers Paul Golonsdki 
and Alex Varela. Together, the three tried to prod the opossum into a cardboard 
box. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't easy, said Officer Ken Daily, a CHP spokesman. "The thing was really 
hissing and snapping, so nobody was really going to get close and check him for 
broken bones." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually they succeeded, but their next concern was what to do with a boxed 
opossum. 
</P>
<P>
"They were going to call (county) animal control, but they knew what would 
happen; they would put this thing to sleep," Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
(The county has routinely killed opossums, including more than 3,600 in 1986, 
because the animals can carry a potentially fatal virus. They are not 
endangered and can be legally hunted.) 
</P>
<P>
But the officers didn't really want the opossum killed, Daily said. Neither did 
the man with the Bronco. He offered to take it to San Clemente's animal shelter 
which keeps animals alive as long as they are not seriously ill. The man left 
before he could be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the opossum was dead by the time it got to the animal shelter. 
"There were no visible open wounds. . . . We assume (the animal was) hit by a 
car," shelter manager Roberta Gorny said. 
</P>
<P>
But shelter workers got another surprise. 
</P>
<P>
The opossum was female and inside her pouch were three healthy, furless, 
rat-tailed, 2-week-old baby opossums who continued to nurse off their dead 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
So Gorny called an expert, Laguna Beach veterinarian Drew J. Barras, who 
rehabilitates injured or orphaned wild animals. 
</P>
<P>
Barras volunteered to "foster" the opossum babies at his home -- keep them 
warm, feed them around the clock, and eventually, if they got strong enough, 
release them back to the wild. 
</P>
<P>
Barras, 36, has done this sort of thing many times since graduating from 
veterinary school in Mississippi in 1982. Still, he was not prepared for the 
size of the baby animals. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected to see possums that 
</P>
<P>
weighed a couple of pounds each -- nasty, little, mean things that I'd have to 
throw food to. . . . I didn't envision them this young. They can't weigh more 
than a couple of ounces each." All three, he said, "fit in the palm of my 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
Barras said he plans to keep the baby opossums in his bedroom in a small box 
lined with hot-water bottles. About every 3 hours, he will use a syringe to 
feed them a mixture of a milk substitute and egg yolk. After 2 weeks, when 
their eyes open, he will put them on solid food, probably cat food. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 3 to 4 months after that, Barras said, he will keep the young 
opossums in a bucket -- "kinda like staying in mama's pouch. I'd kinda like to 
give them that atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Though the baby opossums are healthy now, "the toughest time is the first few 
days" after their mother's death, Barras said. Baby opossums are "not ones to 
nurse bottles," he pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
But late Tuesday, one question about the orphaned opossums had been answered: 
their sex. Barras has determined that two of the possums are females and one a 
male.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge forbade the San Diego City Council Tuesday from taking action on 
petitions that would force a citywide referendum on plans to build 3,360 homes 
north of Lake Miramar until after an April 3 court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Kevin Midlam set the hearing date after BCE Development 
asked him for an injunction to prevent the council from certifying the 
petitions. BCE is seeking to prevent the referendum from being included on the 
Sept. 19 primary ballot. BCE's attorneys argued that the firm will suffer a 
financial loss if the injunction is not issued. 
</P>
<P>
Midlam was not persuaded by that argument, and responded that BCE is taking a 
risk anyway by pressing forward with the development. Nevertheless, the judge 
agreed to postpone a decision on the matter until April 3, when he will allow 
the developer's attorneys to present broader arguments in favor of the 
injunction. 
</P>
<P>
The April date was agreed to by attorneys for BCE and the city.

<P>
Sandra Tsing Loh, the pianist who once serenaded motorists from a parking 
garage near the Harbor Freeway, now plans a musical welcome for some grunion. 
</P>
<P>
Loh, accompanied by the Topanga Symphony Orchestra, will lug a baby grand piano 
onto Malibu Surfrider Beach near midnight on March 25. 
</P>
<P>
When the elusive little fish come ashore, everyone will break into "Night of 
the Grunion," a 10-minute Loh composition intended to unite "land and sea life 
. . . in symphonic harmony with nature's eternal rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
Grunion, of course, aren't the most dependable of God's rhythmic creatures, as 
millions of discouraged would-be watchers can attest. But Fiona Cherbak, Loh's 
manager, is optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"High tide is at 11:37 and if the audience cooperates with nature by being 
quiet, we think they will show," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But if the grunion are AWOL? 
</P>
<P>
"We'll play anyway," said Cherbak. "We've hired the orchestra to perform." 
</P>
<P>
"I know there's a housing shortage in L.A., but this is ridiculous," said Allan 
Howard. 
</P>
<P>
Howard recently opened his post office box to find a computerized letter from a 
landscaping firm that began: 
</P>
<P>
"I have just been told you recently moved into your new home at P.O. Box. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
The company offered to send Howard 15 great plants "to create an exceptional 
floral display in The Howard Garden. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Dwarf varieties? 
</P>
<P>
In the more-is-more category, a Los Angeles County man who held one of four 
winning Lotto tickets to a $15.9-million jackpot has filed suit in Superior 
Court to get a bigger share. 
</P>
<P>
He contends that money from one of the unclaimed tickets should be shared by 
him and the other two winners. If he gets his way, the trio would pull down 
$5.5 million each, instead of having to settle for the paltry sum of less than 
$4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The beneficiary of unclaimed ticket revenues, by the way, is the California 
Lottery Education Fund. 
</P>
<P>
No danger of an ocean wave knocking down the latest creation of Sand Sculptures 
International. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-foot-tall medieval sand castle, described as a "gift to the Japanese 
community," reposes on the second floor of the Little Tokyo Square shopping 
complex, a safe 15 miles from the ocean (and a good quarter-mile from the 
always-dangerous Los Angeles River). 
</P>
<P>
The castle, which resembles the mansion that producer Aaron Spelling is 
building in the Hollywood Hills, was constructed with 10 tons of sand from 
Hansen Dam in the San Fernando Valley, as well as quarters that form the eyes 
of a dragon that lurks outside. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhat marring the ambiance is the logo of the cigarette company that 
sponsored construction, carved into one side of the sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to imagine the Knights of the Round Table carrying the banner of 
a cigarette company into battle. 
</P>
<P>
Bicyclists accused of racketeering? Who next? Rock climbers? Back-packers? 
</P>
<P>
A fledgling pro bicycle racing league filed a $3-million lawsuit in Los Angeles 
against an amateur pedalers' racing federation, accusing it of attempting to 
regulate the pro sport. 
</P>
<P>
The National Cycle League charged the 68-year-old United States Cycling 
Federation with such practices as allegedly demanding that the NCL and its 
riders pay the USCF licensing fees. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks triple damages, which are available under federal civil 
Racketeering Influence Corrupt Organization (RICO) fraud laws. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Cycling Federation denies the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The competition's getting vicious among Mexican food stands downtown on Hoover 
Boulevard, where Lucy's advertises that it's "Open 24 Hours," while, across the 
street, Mario's boasts, "Open 25 Hours."

MARINE FLEES BASE, ELUDES AUTHORITIES

<TEXT>
<P>
An all-points bulletin was issued Tuesday for a Marine, suspected of being 
under the influence of drugs, who fled from the Marine Corps Air Station at 
Tustin after a fellow Marine tried to escort him to a base medical facility. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine, whose name was withheld by military authorities, fled the base in 
his car after threatening to detonate its gas tank if the other Marine moved 
any closer, Marine officials said in a brief statement. The Marine reportedly 
claimed that his vehicle's gas tank was wired to explode. 
</P>
<P>
Base military police notified the California Highway Patrol, which issued the 
bulletin for the Marine's arrest. A short time later, CHP officers, assisted by 
the Orange County Sheriff's Department, stopped a car in El Toro that matched 
the description but it was the wrong car.

PEOPLE / HERBERT J. VIDA: RUNNING TOGETHER IS CREDITED WITH KEEPING FAMILY ON 
TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert J. Vida 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the most part, running is a spiritual outlet for Thor Ericson and his 
family, but it goes even deeper than that. 
</P>
<P>
He sees it as a way of preserving family togetherness, sort of like "the family 
that runs together, stays together." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of deterioration going on in family life and one of the ways to 
relieve the pressure is to do something with the children," he said. "I see 
running as one of the ways." 
</P>
<P>
Ericson, a Whittier junior high school art teacher and pastor of La Habra 
Community Bible Church, has a simple explanation. "We run together because we 
want to be together, and we like to have it witnessed by the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
And the father has a quaint way of explaining another reason for the family 
sport. "My wife enjoys it, and it helps keep her trim, and she likes that. And 
I like that." 
</P>
<P>
The 6 of them -- Thor, 46, Janice, 46, Noel, 18, Shawn, 15, Megan, 12, and Wyn, 
9 -- just ran in Sunday's Los Angeles Marathon and all finished the race 
despite the heat that caused so much discomfort for them. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran together for a while and talked about the marathon and other races we 
ran in and what we learned from them," said the father, who finished the race 
with two of his sons by his side while his wife and daughter completed the race 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"Shawn was just too much for us and completed the race far ahead of us all," he 
said. But he noted that the family had dinner together where they relived the 
outing. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn, only a freshman at a Whittier high school, has already lettered in 
varsity track. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly, we talked about all the help everyone gave us with water and food 
during the race and that's what helped us the most," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thor Ericson has long found running an ideal time to think. "You can get in a 
lot of creative thinking while you're out there keeping your body in shape," he 
said. "After you get over the pain that running sometimes causes when you first 
start, a person can learn to enjoy some deep thinking." 
</P>
<P>
But running is just another aspect of family cohesion, the father said. "It's 
nice to do something with the entire family, especially in a sport where we can 
all be together. It builds a lot of family character." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take much to entice the children into running. "Kids just love to get 
rewards," he said. "We're living in a rewards-system society, and the thought 
of winning a trophy is fantastic for them." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone is the family has won trophies. So many, in fact, that they had to 
build a special trophy closet. 
</P>
<P>
And at Thanksgiving time, the entire family has a different role. They help out 
in Janice Thor's pumpkin patch business in La Habra. An art teacher, she offers 
classes on how to paint faces on pumpkins. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess if we didn't decide to be a family that runs together," said Thor 
Ericson, "it would be something else. Maybe we would be painting together." 
</P>
<P>
Ice sculptor Mark Daukas of Newport Beach is on a cold roll, so to speak. He 
has won just about every ice-sculpting contest he has entered, including the 
U.S. Championship, and he just added the International Ice Carving Team 
Championship in Japan to his credits. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest honor of all," said Daukas, who teamed with Steve Rose of 
Boston. "We really didn't get any money for winning. It was mostly an honor. In 
fact, I lost a lot of out-of-pocket money paying the expenses. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The two took 48 hours to carve the winning fantasy art piece called "Hard 
Climb," featuring a voluptuous woman, a saber-toothed tiger and a muscular man 
with a sword. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Gene Evans, a former ballerina who now performs as a tap dancer, had a 
dilemma. Everyone wanted to have a party for her 95th birthday on March 25. 
</P>
<P>
"Several of the girls wanted to give me a party and if I chose one, I was in 
trouble with the others, so I decided to throw a party for myself," said Evans, 
of Newport Beach, who still takes tap-dancing classes and performs with a group 
called the Happy Hoofers. 
</P>
<P>
And what a party it is going to be at the Newport Beach Tennis Club. She 
already has an invitation list of 112, including boyfriends and husbands who no 
doubt will be treated to a little tap-dancing performance by "the girls," as 
she calls them. "I can call them that because most of them are 30 years younger 
than me." 
</P>
<P>
But this party is just the beginning. "I'm going to start saving my money so I 
can throw myself a party for my 100th birthday," she vowed.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: NATIONAL CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A transient was ordered Tuesday to stand trial in connection with two slayings 
that occurred 11 days apart. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Jon Kemp, 25, is charged with the Nov. 28 stabbing of Geralie (Jane) 
Bertrand, 34, of National City, who was fatally wounded in front of her two 
children and mother following a violent argument with Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp is also accused of the Nov. 17 slaying of Chester (Earl) Grandison, 38, of 
Hillcrest, whose nude body was found the next morning by his roommate. He had 
been stabbed 18 times. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Frank Brown set a March 21 arraignment and trial 
setting appearance for Kemp following the conclusion of the 2 1/2-day 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp remains in County Jail in lieu of $800,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Bertrand's two daughters, ages 12 and 13, and her mother testified Friday that 
they saw Kemp lunge at Bertrand and she fell to the floor, mortally wounded. 
However, none of the witnesses said they saw a knife in Kemp's hand. 
</P>
<P>
They said Kemp was angry because Bertrand had loaned his radio to someone. 
Bertrand called police, and was stabbed after she told Kemp the police had been 
called, said the witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
A police technician testified that bloody footprints found in Grandison's 
bathroom matched Kemp's footprints. 
</P>
<P>
A key to the gate of Grandison's apartment complex was in Kemp's pocket when he 
was arrested, police said.

MUNICIPAL COURT GETS 5 NEW JUDGES DAY AFTER 7 OTHER APPOINTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second straight day, Gov. George Deukmejian Tuesday filled vacancies on 
San Diego County's overburdened courts, appointing three men and two women to 
seats on the Municipal Court bench. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting a pattern present in Deukmejian's previous judicial appointments in 
San Diego, three of the five new judges -- Allan J. Preckel, Gale E. Kaneshiro 
and Terry J. Knoepp -- are current or former prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining appointees, Marguerite L. Wagner and Timothy W. Tower, have 
considerable civil law experience, as does Knoepp, who has been in private 
practice since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
All but one of the new judges will sit on the San Diego bench. Wagner will fill 
a new position on the North County Municipal Court in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Wake of 7 Appointments 
</P>
<P>
The appointments come just one day after the governor named seven new Superior 
Court judges, including four he elevated from the San Diego Municipal Court. 
Those appointments brought relief to Superior Court officials -- who last month 
postponed all new civil trials because of a glut of pressing criminal cases -- 
but sparked worries that the Municipal Court might have trouble shouldering its 
caseload. 
</P>
<P>
Those concerns were alleviated by mid-morning Tuesday, when word of the 
appointments reached San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm certainly pleased that the governor saw fit to fill our vacancies as 
quickly as he did," said E. Mac Amos Jr., presiding judge of the San Diego 
Municipal Court. "That brings us back up to 25 judges. We can manage with that 
number. There will be a little delay bringing them on board, but I'm very 
pleased." 
</P>
<P>
Under a new state funding program for trial courts, the municipal bench is 
scheduled to receive another three judges sometime in 1989, Amos said. 
Currently, there is little room for those jurists in the cramped downtown 
courthouse on Broadway. But Amos said remodeling -- which has been held up by 
an asbestos problem plaguing the building -- will create space for future 
appointees. 
</P>
<P>
"We're splitting one courtroom and converting a judge's chambers, among other 
things," Amos said. "We'll be ready." 
</P>
<P>

attorney's office, where he has served as chief of special operations for four 
years. His most highly publicized case in recent years was the prosecution of 
former San Diego City Councilman Uvaldo Martinez, who pleaded guilty in 1987 to 
two felony counts in connection with his misuse of a city credit card. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relishes the Challenge 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly look forward to the challenge and appreciate the governor's 
confidence in me," said Preckel, a graduate of the University of Santa Clara 
and the University of Chicago. "But you don't spend 17 years in this office . . 
. without bonding very tightly with the people here."

<P>
Knoepp, 51, is a graduate of UC Berkeley and the Boalt Hall law school there, 
and is the third appointee with a prosecutorial background. He was a deputy 
district attorney from 1966 to 1975, when he became the U.S. attorney in San 
Diego. He held that post for three years and then became a partner in the firm 
of Smith, Bollman &amp; Knoepp. Most recently, he practiced law with the firm 
Worley, Schwartz, Garfield &amp; Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Tower, 43, is senior counsel for San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., a position 
he has held since 1979. Previously, he spent three years as a partner with the 
law firm Legro, Renetto, Pate and Tower and also worked for Gray, Cary, Ames 
&amp; Frye for five years. Tower is a graduate of UC Davis and Boalt Hall.

SADDLEBACK BOARD DELAYS BUS CUTBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parents worried about their children's safety persuaded the Saddleback Unified 
School District board Tuesday night to postpone any cutbacks in free bus 
transportation until at least the fall. 
</P>
<P>
However, the board voted to reconsider the same plan, at a meeting April 4, for 
the school year beginning in September. 
</P>
<P>
Board members also said Tuesday that reducing the bus service now would 
interrupt students' schedules and would cause confusion. 
</P>
<P>
For 5 years, the district had charged $135 per student for bus service to and 
from school. But last December the state barred school districts from charging 
fees for bus service, following an appellate court ruling that those fees were 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the district pays for bus transportation for students in 
kindergarten through sixth grade who live at least three-fourths of a mile from 
school, for seventh- and eighth-graders who live at least a mile away, and for 
older students who live 2 or more miles away. 
</P>
<P>
The plan shelved by unanimous vote Tuesday would have increased the minimum 
distances for all age groups. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents from the Portola Hills area who have teen-agers attending El Toro 
High School on Toledo Way in El Toro said they were worried about their 
children walking 3.5 miles along El Toro Road to get to school. 
</P>
<P>
"He might as well walk on the San Diego or the Santa Ana freeway because they 
go 65 m.p.h. there too," parent Suzanne Childress said before the meeting.

Harbor Police expect assault charges to be filed this week against a 
27-year-old man who allegedly fired a spear gun at two officers when they 
confronted him as he fished in San Diego Bay near Seaport Village. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Police Chief Arthur G. LeBlanc said Tuesday that Brian James Ray of San 
Diego was snorkeling and fishing in the water about 2:15 p.m. Monday. Such 
diving is illegal, LeBlanc said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not allowed to swim there, or do any fishing, plus . . . you're not 
allowed to be diving in the bay without a permit," he said, citing heavy boat 
traffic and unsafe water conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Police Officers Gary Leeson and James Bird were patrolling the area in a 
boat when they spotted Ray and ordered him out of the water. Ray responded by 
shooting a spear at the officers' boat, then swam ashore, LeBlanc said. 
</P>
<P>
Ray reached shore and had reloaded his spear gun by the time the Harbor Police 
officers docked their boat and stepped ashore, LeBlanc said. Leeson raised his 
own gun, ordered Ray to drop his weapon, and arrested him on suspicion of 
assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc said Ray faces other charges including fishing without a license. 
</P>
<P>
Ray was being held at County Jail in lieu of $6,060 bail.

WOMAN'S DEATH LAID TO SAME BATCH OF CYANIDE USED TO KILL GRANDMOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE BUNDY SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Costa Mesa woman committed suicide last December by drinking a cyanide potion 
from the same batch that her father had used to poison his mother 7 years ago, 
authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Roxene Jacobs, 37, was discovered in the bedroom of her Avocado 
Street apartment Dec. 7. Police found a drinking glass with a spoon and 
crystallized potassium cyanide in the bottom. No suicide note was found. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa Police Detective Steve Labbitt said Tuesday that police had evidence 
at the time of Jacobs' death showing that she may have consumed cyanide but had 
waited for a toxicology report to confirm the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Labbitt said Jacobs was despondent because her ex-husband had won custody of 
their daughter, and she was 8 months behind in her child-support payments. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs' father, Herbert B. Baetz, was convicted of first-degree murder in 1982 
for poisoning his 87-year-old mother, Janette Baetz. At his trial, Herbert 
Baetz testified that he had mixed a potion of potassium cyanide and orange 
juice and given it to his mother at her request. Prosecutors argued that he had 
murdered her. 
</P>
<P>
The jury found Baetz guilty and he was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Labbitt said that Baetz, who was a chemist and gold prospector, had purchased a 
number of bottles of cyanide in 1980, and the poison that killed Janette Baetz 
and Jacobs "came from the same lot number," Labbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
The Jacobs case was the second cyanide-related death reported in Orange County 
in recent weeks. On Feb. 23, more than a year after Capistrano Unified School 
District trustee Jan Overton had died, the coroner's office said her death was 
caused by cyanide poisoning. Overton's death, attributed at first to natural 
causes, is still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Overton and Jacobs knew each other, but there is no link between their deaths, 
Labbitt said. Jacobs had worked for the Orange County Department of Education 
from November, 1982, to October, 1988, a time during which Overton was a 
Capistrano school trustee.

TRIAL TO RESUME TODAY; 
</P>
<P>
KRAFT JUDGE LISTENS TO WITNESSES IN SECRET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time since the murder trial of Randy Steven Kraft began in July, 
the judge Tuesday heard testimony from witnesses during a closed-door hearing 
and ordered attorneys in the case not to discuss the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held on the record, with a court reporter present, but Superior 
Court Judge Donald A. McCartin ordered the record and the clerk's minutes 
sealed from public view. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors had been dismissed at the end of court Monday and told not to return 
until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers in the case declined to comment on what took place Tuesday, citing the 
judge's order. Nor would they say what impact the subject of the in-chambers 
hearing might have on the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, 43, a Long Beach computer consultant, is on trial in Santa Ana charged 
with murdering 16 young men. Prosecutors have told the court that if he is 
convicted, they may introduce up to 29 other murders in seeking a death 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft was present for the closed-door hearing, along with one of his attorneys, 
C. Thomas McDonald. Others present were Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown, the 
judge and some members of his staff. 
</P>
<P>
McCartin would only say in the open courtroom that the Kraft trial will be in 
session today. Defense attorneys had wanted the judge to postpone the trial 
until next Monday. But the judge said arrangements had been made so that 
further postponement was unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
The closed-door meeting was highly unusual for McCartin, who was the first 
judge in the Kraft case to unseal records that had been closed to the public 
for more than five years. Defense attorneys had wanted to leave sealed a list 
found in Kraft's car that prosecutors have called a "death list," or raft's own 
score card of how many murders he had committed. But the judge ordered the list 
unsealed in September after the jurors had heard opening statements. 
</P>
<P>
McCartin has held numerous hearings with witnesses outside the presence of the 
jury since the trial began. But those hearings have always been in open court 
where the public could view them. He has met in chambers with the attorneys 
several times, however. 
</P>
<P>
Four witnesses, three women and a man, were led into the judge's chambers one 
at a time Tuesday. It could not be determined whether they had been called by 
the defense, the prosecution, or the judge himself. However, after three of 
them testified, the district attorney's top investigator on the Kraft case, Dan 
Disanto, thanked them for any inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office has a policy of generally opposing closed-door 
sessions. The public's business should be conducted in public, Chief Assistant 
Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi has stated. 
</P>
<P>
But Capizzi said Tuesday that exceptions must sometimes be made. 
</P>
<P>
"The Supreme Court has made it quite clear that in some situations it is 
appropriate to meet in chambers, and as long as it is evaluated on an 
individual basis, we have no quarrel with that," Capizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
The closed hearing came in the middle of the sixth week of the defense's 
presentation of its case. The defense is not expected to conclude until the end 
of March.

KEITH EDGES WALKER TO WIN CORONADO VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Susan Keith, chairwoman of the Coronado Planning Commission, appeared to have 
won a narrow victory Tuesday night over three other candidates in a race for a 
vacant Coronado City Council seat, according to unofficial results released by 
the San Diego County registrar of voters. 
</P>
<P>
With 100% of the votes counted, Keith led Greg Walker, a jewelry store owner, 
by 29 votes, or 2,217 to 2,188. However, an official at the registrar's office 
said 27 absentee and 14 provisional ballots remained to be counted. A 
provisional ballot is one that needs to be validated by making sure that a 
voter is properly registered. 
</P>
<P>
Two other candidates, Donald Zub, a former Navy SEAL and construction worker, 
and Louis de Beer, an engineer and computer consultant, trailed badly with 172 
and 153 votes, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Keith is expected to fill the seat left vacant when Councilwoman Mary Herron 
was elected mayor in November. Herron defeated incumbent R.H. Dorman. Keith 
will serve for the remaining two years of Herron's council term. 
</P>
<P>
The registrar's spokesman said 42.8% of Coronado's 11,190 registered voters 
turned out in the special election.

ORNELAS HAS NO RECALL OF FATAL CRASH, LAWYER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Danny David Ornelas, on trial for murder in the vehicular death of a Newport 
Beach mother last September, has no memory of the incident, his lawyer said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney, Ralph Bencangey, said in an interview that Ornelas cannot 
remember anything about driving a car in a narrow alley on Balboa Peninsula and 
striking and fatally injuring Debbie Killelea on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
An expert witness has also testified that Ornelas had told him he was unable to 
remember anything about the fatal crash. "He (Ornelas) said he can't even 
remember turning on the ignition," said the witness, Ted A. Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas, 19, of Huntington Park, is on trial in Orange County Superior Court in 
Westminster on a charge of second-degree murder. One of the closely watched 
aspects of the trial has been whether the young defendant would take the stand 
to give his version of the fatal collision. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Bencangey completed his presentation of the defense's case, and 
Ornelas was not called to testify. Bencangey, however, said he may still call 
him Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to disclose what we plan to do," said Bencangey, in an interview 
outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution has accused Ornelas of drunkenly driving a speeding car into 
the alley and deliberately running down Killelea, 37, as she stood with her two 
young sons. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Luis A. Cardenas several times on Tuesday prohibited Bencangey from 
questioning another witness about the effect of alcohol intoxication on memory 
loss. Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Goethals had objected and the judge agreed, 
ruling the witness was not an expert in psychology or memory loss. 
</P>
<P>
Bencangey later said the ruling did not hurt the defense because Mitchell, on 
Monday, had already testified that Ornelas is unable to remember the car 
collision. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, an automotive engineer who is an expert in analyzing car accidents, 
testified Monday that people in such accidents often repress memories of the 
event. Ornelas only has "nightmares and dreams but no specific recollections," 
Mitchell told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Darrell Clardy, an expert in analyzing behavior of drunk drivers 
and a toxicologist formerly employed by the Orange County Sheriff's Department, 
said he believes Ornelas only had a 0.04 blood-alcohol level at the time the 
collision occurred -- 5 p.m. Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas, who was arrested 35 minutes after the collision, had a blood alcohol 
level of 0.18 at 6:43 p.m. when a blood sample was taken, law enforcement 
experts have testified. Under state law, anyone with a blood alcohol level of 
0.10 is considered intoxicated. Ornelas thus registered almost twice the level 
of legal intoxication. Clardy's testimony in effect challenged whether Ornelas 
was that drunk when the impact took place. Clardy noted that Ornelas and two 
friends were drinking strong rum at the beach shortly before Ornelas went to 
the car to drive it down the alley. Clardy said strong intoxicants sometimes 
are not absorbed into the bloodstream until long after being consumed. 
</P>
<P>
Bencangey attempted to ask Clardy several questions about how some car accident 
victims lose memories of the events, but the judge would not allow the 
questions.

POLICE WILL WEAR THEIR PRIDE ON THEIR UNIFORMS IN FORM OF CENTENNIAL BADGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They won't be wearing the derby hats and high-collared coats that were stylish 
100 years ago, but many San Diego police officers this year will commemorate 
the department's centennial by swapping their badges for a six-point star, 
beginning this week. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Bob Burgreen is expected to receive his star Thursday, and other 
officers -- 600 have ordered the $45 to $64 badges so far -- will begin wearing 
theirs afterward. Sgt. Willie P. Smith, who conceived the idea and designed the 
commemorative badges, estimates that 1,200 of the Police Department's 1,735 
employees will purchase and wear the stars this year. 
</P>
<P>
Symbolic of a day when San Diego police officers relied mostly on raw courage 
and the guns in their holsters to bring criminals to justice, the new badges 
will be worn at the outset of the department's pledge to win back the streets 
from gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"The stars are a way of dropping back a little bit and putting the past and 
present together," Smith said. "The only problem the badge will see today that 
it didn't see (100 years ago) is that we are somewhat restrained as to what we 
can do. Officers have to be a lot more up on the law these days. I think about 
all you had to be back then was quick." 
</P>
<P>
Officers can wear the six-point stars, which were approved by the City Council 
as substitutes for the official shields, until Jan. 1. The Police Department 
will be 100 years old May 16. 
</P>
<P>
The gold-plated star, which is expected to bolster pride in the department, is 
not an exact replica of the badges worn in the early days. The new star, at 3 
inches across, is slightly larger than the original and includes a blue ribbon 
across the top that indicates the officer's rank. 
</P>
<P>
"The badges have already been very positive in terms of boosting morale," Smith 
said. "The officers of this department, if they look back over the last 100 
years, will see that they do have a lot to be proud of from day one." 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department was established May 16, 1889, and located in City Hall, 
then at G Street and 5th Avenue. Before that, the military and city marshals 
enforced the law in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The city's first police chief, Joseph Coyne, was appointed June 1, 1889. He was 
paid $125 a month, while policemen earned $100 a month and worked 7 days a 
week, 12 hours a day, according to records provided by the department.

SUPREME COURT ON CHILD ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bravo! Rehnquist has finally said it! No hedging, no beating around the Bush. 
The Supreme Court rules that "Nothing in the language of the due process clause 
itself requires the state to protect the life, liberty and property of its 
citizens against invasion." Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's loud and clear: The 
Administration is washing its hands. 
</P>
<P>
If a policeman walks by while you are clobbered on the street, and he doesn't 
move a finger to protect you, under the new ruling you can't sue him or anybody 
else. If the possibly exonerating evidence in your trial is "lost" by the 
officials (biased or not), you have only yourself to blame. Yes, you are on 
your own. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, you still have to pay your taxes; the Constitution does not protect 
you from the IRS, but whether or not the services in return will be forthcoming 
is left to the benevolence of the state agencies. See if they feel like it. If, 
in the midst of a disintegrating welfare system, skyrocketing medical and 
insurance costs, inflation, bailouts, homelessness, drugs and cultural 
deprivation, you still had any doubts as to whose interest this Administration 
is representing, set them aside now. Just look up and count your thousand 
points of light!

MISUSING LOTTERY MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

California's schoolchildren, billed as the big winners when the state lottery 
was on the ballot, are being cheated. The money pouring into the lottery as 
Californians try to win pots like Saturday's $44.3 million is supposed to 
enrich school programs just as it enriched four winners last weekend. Instead, 
too many school districts are using the money for salaries and other day-to-day 
operations. That is exactly what the lottery's opponents feared, and the 
situation creates an unwise dependency on gambling and an unfortunate 
distortion of the schools' financial picture. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Lotto fever swept the state, Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig 
threw cold water on the misguided notion that the proceeds are adding valuable 
programs to the public schools. State law earmarks one-third of the lottery 
revenues for public education. Lottery advocates assured voters during the 1984 
campaign that created the game that the money would be a bonus for the schools 
rather than supplanting existing support. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't happened that way. Financially hard-pressed school districts are 
using the money not for extras like library books and computers but rather for 
basics like salaries and textbooks. In a recent report to the Legislature, 
Honig said a survey of 841 of the state's approximately 1,000 school districts 
showed that they spend more than half their lottery money on salaries and 
benefits. Another 14% is spent on maintenance and equipment and 13% on books 
and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
That's certainly true in the Los Angeles Unified School District, which last 
year received $83.4 million in lottery money and spent nearly 85% of it on 
basic operating costs, mainly teachers' salaries. The district is also counting 
on lottery money to help provide salary increases under whatever contract 
agreement it reaches with the United Teachers of Los Angeles union. Today 
people appear hooked on the lottery so that may seem a winning proposition. But 
it's a bad gamble -- and a bad example for children -- in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
As lottery earnings have increased, Honig says, the amount the state spends on 
each student has decreased. Adjusted for inflation, the amount dropped by $46 
during the last school year and may do so again this year. This, at a time when 
the demands on public schools have never been higher: Teachers deserve higher 
pay, half the students who enroll at some high schools drop out before 
graduation and more teachers are needed to instruct the 140,000 additional 
students who are flooding California schools each year. Neither local school 
administrators nor state officials should be allowed to substitute lottery 
earnings for basic support from the state's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
The lottery is a game of chance. It's time it was used to give schools the true 
chance to enrich their students, not just struggle to pay basic bills. At least 
someone -- Bill Honig -- has finally pointed a finger at a growing problem.

SPOTLIGHT ON THE INS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh has decided to replace the controversial Alan 
C. Nelson as commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. But 
just finding a replacement for Nelson will not solve all the problems the Bush 
Administration inherits in INS. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' Washington Bureau reported this week that Nelson, a California 
attorney, will be replaced in spite of his campaign to retain the job to which 
he was appointed by Ronald Reagan. Nelson is an old friend of former U.S. Atty. 
Gen. Edwin Meese III, and his close ties with Meese helped Nelson through 
several scrapes during his seven years at INS. But a recent audit by the 
General Accounting Office, which found evidence of mismanagement at INS, has 
given Thornburgh the ammunition he needs to oust Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
In fairness, the INS commissioner's job has proven to be a difficult task for 
everyone who has held it since the 1970s, when the first of a series of GAO and 
congressional studies found management problems in the agency. These problems 
resulted from the fact that Congress had not paid much attention to INS since 
World War II, leaving the agency chronically understaffed and underfunded. Now, 
it is notorious as the most inefficient agency in the federal bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has been trying to make up for its neglect of INS, most recently 
voting to hire more Border Patrol agents under the Immigration Reform and 
Control Act of 1986. But this belated attention has had only minimal effect on 
the INS, because it comes at a time when political turmoil and population 
growth in many parts of the world have created a surge of immigration to this 
nation, which is overwhelming INS all over again. 
</P>
<P>
Some see this wave of new immigrants as a threat, but we prefer to see it as a 
challenge to American ingenuity. How can these newcomers, whether permanent or 
temporary, be dealt with humanely? When Congress passed the immigration reform 
act of 1986, it took a step in the right direction, but it forget to reform the 
agency charged with carrying out the new law. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that there were no proposals to reform INS. Several GAO studies have 
suggested the government could more efficiently guard the nation's frontiers if 
the Border Patrol were part of a single border-management agency that would 
also include other federal agencies, like the Customs Service and Coast Guard, 
that currently share the burden and do not always coordinate their activities 
well. 
</P>
<P>
And demographers predict that, because of declining natural birth rates in this 
country, half of the nation's population growth in the next century will occur 
as the result of new immigration. That should have prodded Congress to upgrade 
INS' naturalization functions, perhaps putting them into a new bureau of 
immigration, so that the government could better help newcomers adapt to 
American society. INS is doing that, somewhat haphazardly, under the amnesty 
program included in the 1986 immigration law. But if immigration is going to 
have the impact on U.S. society demographers think it will have, a more formal 
system must be created to deal with its effects. 
</P>
<P>
These long-range issues must not be overlooked by the Bush Administration as it 
seeks a new INS commissioner. The right kind of leader for that beleaguered 
agency will not just deal with the problems it has today, but prepare INS for 
the profound challenges of the future.

SUPREME COURT ON CHILD ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wait a minute. The Supreme Court says, in the case of a small child so badly 
brutalized by his father that he will live out his life profoundly brain 
damaged, the government (federal, state or local) has no duty under the 
Constitution to protect that child from danger or to intervene to save his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
The same Supreme Court is about to reconsider a woman's right to make decisions 
concerning her own body and it's quite possible that government may once again 
have the right (duty) under the Constitution to protect a fetus from danger by 
intervening to save its life (by making abortion illegal). 
</P>
<P>
You can't have it both ways. Either everyone is protected -- before or after 
birth -- or no one is protected. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion remains an issue of one group's power over another. And look who's in 
control, from local to state to federal officials -- a sea of male faces. Faces 
that will never, never have to make the difficult choice to have an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
As Jane O'Reilly says in her book ("The Girl I Left Behind"), "The one absolute 
alternative to the possibility of needing an abortion is to be born a man."

SUPREME COURT ON CHILD ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was fortunate to be able to hear oral argument in Deshaney vs. Winnebago 
County Dept. of Social Services on Nov. 2, 1988, and to read David Savage's 
article on the case ("Rehnquist Court Restricting Constitutional Protections," 
Part I, Feb. 24). Counsel for Deshaney argued that the child had been taken 
from the father by the county and in court proceedings the child was returned 
with the agreement that the social worker would make frequent checks on the 
child's safety. She did not do so. She entered in her notes that she strongly 
believed the next time she saw the child he would be dead or seriously injured. 
This came to pass. Under questioning, the state's attorney admitted that if the 
child were in a foster home, the state would be liable. 
</P>
<P>
No matter the labels we attribute to Chief Justice William Rehnquist and the 
court's majority, we are departing from the political theory our Constitution 
was founded upon. Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Rousseau wrote on the social 
contract as the underpinnings of an orderly society. We gave up some of our 
liberties to the state in exchange for protection and safety. This was a higher 
level of civilization from a state of nature, or anarchy, where some lived 
outside the law. Their teachings were endorsed by Thomas Jefferson and carried 
over into our Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
How strange to hear the chief justice expound that "The 14th Amendment was 
intended to prevent government from abusing its power. . . ." Is it not an 
abuse of power for the government to operate a police force, as its sole 
monopoly, to protect its citizens and refuse to do so?

HELP FOR TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last month, arctic winds brought much more to Los Angeles than morning frost 
and snow on Interstate 5. The gusty winds brought hundreds of Southern 
Californians to respond to a simple need: winter clothing for homeless 
teen-agers. On behalf of those kids, we want to thank all those who helped. 
</P>
<P>
I was personally overwhelmed and moved by the generosity of the Los Angeles 
community. During the cold snap here, civic organizations and private citizens 
pulled together in a countywide clothing drive coordinated by Covenant House 
for the youth living on the streets. Immediately following County Supervisor 
Michael Antonovich's announcement of a countywide clothing drive, donations of 
clothing began arriving on our doorstep. Over 300 bags and boxes overflowing 
with blankets, wool coats, ski jackets, sweaters, and socks were delivered in 
the first two days alone. 
</P>
<P>
As the clothes piled in, volunteers donated their time to sort them so they 
could be properly distributed to many local service agencies working with the 
homeless kids throughout the county. What was a mere inconvenience to most of 
us could be deadly to someone on the street. But, it also, in one way, was a 
blessing in disguise. The cold spell provided an opportunity to join the Los 
Angeles community together in an effort to help kids on the street and to 
remind us of those in need.

TURN ON "CHANNEL ONE," TURN OFF VALUES

<P>
If I were to characterize the genial and creative head of Whittle 
Communications I would describe him as one of those people who want to do well 
by doing good. Like the pop business manuals say, he thinks of a crisis as an 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis at hand is the miserable state of education. He talks earnestly 
about teen-agers who think the Holocaust is a Jewish holiday and Geraldine 
Ferraro is a talk-show host. 
</P>
<P>
The opportunity, as he sees it, is to produce and beam a national news program 
right into the schools. He would provide color TV monitors, VCRs, satellite 
dishes and ten minutes of fairly zippy daily news. In return, the schools would 
provide a guaranteed teen-age audience for two minutes of commercials. 
</P>
<P>
The test run of this trade-off is a program called Channel One that will begin 
on Monday in schools in Kansas City, Detroit, Knoxville, Cerritos, Calif., 
Billerica, Mass., and Cincinnati. If all goes well, Whittle hopes that Channel 
One will be broadcast in 8,000 high schools, which means that more teen-agers 
would see this than any other program except the Super Bowl. Commercial heaven. 
</P>
<P>
Whittle likes to talk about this -- indeed likes to think about this -- as "an 
enlightened partnership between the business community and the educational 
community." 
</P>
<P>
All of which makes it harder for him to understand the opposition. Peggy 
Charren, head of Action for Children's Television (ACT), calls this a "Great 
Big Gorgeous Trojan Horse." If the schools go for this trade-off, she says, 
"they might as well auction off the school day to the highest bidder." 
</P>
<P>
Public-interest advocates point to this as a blatant example of the 
"privatization of the public world. " The school day, like a national park, is 
being leased, minute by minute, acre by acre, to private industry. 
</P>
<P>
If the schools allow advertising on television, says Charren in high dudgeon, 
what's to stop them from having advertising in a textbook? If those ads mean 
that the schools could afford twice as many books, says Whittle, let's hear it 
for the ads. 
</P>
<P>
This argument about values is likely to be replayed throughout the 1990s as 
strapped communities try to get more bang for their diminished tax bucks. The 
schools want business involved in partnership. The business community has a 
vested interest in an educated work force and citizenry. 
</P>
<P>
But it is one thing when business is interested in young people as students. 
Quite another when they are interested in students as consumers. It is one 
thing when the marketplace supports the schools. Quite another when the schools 
become a marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Schools are expected to teach students values rather than deals. How does a 
principal explain this commercial exchange? That he sold his students, 
literally? Must the teachers enforce required viewing of messages from Nike or 
McDonald's? 
</P>
<P>
At the very minimum, the schools become the sponsors of commercials. This is a 
deal they can refuse. The schools are not commercial turf. They are the 
marketplace for ideas.

A PALESTINIAN SETTLEMENT REQUIRES LOCAL ELECTIONS -- WHICH REQUIRE U.S. SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GEORGE and HODA ELEMARY, James George, a retired Canadian ambassador 
to the Middle East and South Asia, is president of the Sadat Peace Foundation, 
based in New York. Hoda Elemary, the daughter of former Egyptian Prime Minister 
A. G. Elemary, established the foundation in 1984 with the assistance of 
Presidents Reagan and Carter.

American Jews have, on the whole, kept to themselves their misgivings about the 
way Israel is handling the uprising in the West Bank and Gaza, tending to 
express their concerns only "in the family." Few have wanted to criticize 
Israel, or U.S. policy in support of Israel, on an issue so intimately linked 
to the security of Israel, which not only all Jews but most other Americans 
strongly support. Yet today the suppression of voices of concern may actually 
be undermining the security of Israel by prolonging the intifada, postponing 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and weakening the hand of the U.S. government 
in moving the Middle East peace process forward at a time when real movement 
seems more possible than it has for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Although opinion polls in Israel show that there is a substantial majority for 
trading land in the territories for peace, and a thin majority for negotiating 
the issue with the Palestine Liberation Organization, Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir is strongly against doing either. This position is supported by the 
Jewish lobby in Washington so effectively that few senators and members of 
Congress have challenged it (the letter to the prime minister signed by 30 
senators last March was a notable exception). 
</P>
<P>
Without the support of at least a substantial part of the Jewish community in 
America, Secretary of State James A. Baker III will find it as difficult as his 
predecessors to promote a negotiated solution to the Palestinian conflict. Now 
that the PLO is tentatively trying out a more moderate approach, America's 
dialogue with the PLO is only the first step toward realism and peace. Further 
steps can be encouraged or discouraged according to how the winds of public 
opinion blow on Washington and on Jerusalem. We have only to look at the 
instant effect that American Jews had on Israeli politics when they felt 
threatened by the proposed redefinition of "who is a Jew?" They created enough 
pressure to secure a coalition that excluded the religious parties pushing for 
the new legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli coalition's position is based on support for municipal elections in 
the occupied territories as the key to opening a way to negotiations with the 
Palestinians. For the past 16 months, the Sadat Peace Foundation has been 
promoting this solution with both parties to the conflict through two channels. 
An ongoing citizen diplomacy program meets regularly with Israeli and Arab 
leaders. The other effort is to focus U.S. senators' attention on the 
advantages of municipal elections as an element in raising the prospect for 
peace in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation's conflict-resolution efforts provide an alternative to help the 
Israeli government move forward on the peace process. Prime Minister Shamir has 
said that he would "never" talk to the PLO, and the United States' decision to 
do so will not be enough to bring him to follow suit immediately. He needs an 
interim partner, not from Tunis but from the territories, and free municipal 
elections under U.N. or other international supervision are the obvious means 
for giving him such a Palestinian partner. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 29, PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdel Rahman said that municipal elections 
under these conditions would be acceptable, but he stressed that U.N. forces 
would first have to replace Israeli forces in the territories. This signals PLO 
readiness for the first time to authorize indigenous Palestinian leaders to 
start the process of negotiating with the Israeli government. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Labor Party and some members of Likud are on record favoring a 
withdrawal of Israeli forces from centers of population prior to municipal 
elections, so it no longer seems too much to anticipate that a solid agreement 
may be within reach on this preliminary stage of the peace process, and that 
with such an agreement the intifada would come to an end. All it needs is a 
push from public opinion, primarily from the American Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
Some Israelis fear that municipal elections would be the first step toward the 
creation of a Palestinian state that would have a population much larger than 
that of Israel, and in due course probably would be armed by Arab neighbors to 
join in the final battle to push the Israelis into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Every grouping in the Middle East has its own private nightmares. Lately, 
generals and statesmen of Israel, many of them now speaking out from the 
freedom of retirement from official positions of power, have been pleading for 
their compatriots to awaken from fears deeply implanted in their consciousness 
30 or 40 years ago. They argue, impressively, that Israel is now the strongest 
military power in the region, and its security is not dependent on retaining 
total control over a few miles of occupied territory that modern missiles and 
aircraft can traverse in seconds. Their expert testimony is that Israeli 
security is much better served by trading some land for real peace, 
internationally supervised and guaranteed by both the United States and the 
Soviet Union, leaving their Palestinian neighbors unarmed in whatever entity is 
eventually negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
To continue the stalemate, even at the present level of violence, is too 
costly, politically and economically, for both parties. If this opportunity is 
missed through intransigence, then the real-life nightmare for Israel will be 
not just an intifada but a jihad -- a holy war. It will be led by fanatics who 
are being fed by present frustrations, and who will make the PLO look like 
genuine moderates. 
</P>
<P>
It is a momentous choice, and one that is likely to be made, for better or for 
worse, this year. It is a choice that will affect not only Israelis and 
Palestinians, but all of us on this shrinking planet. It is time for all who 
see the danger and the opportunity to be heard while there is still time to 
unite our voices to give peace a chance now.

3 SEX SHOPS AGREE TO MAKE CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three San Fernando Valley sex shops have agreed to provide more indoor and 
outdoor lighting, hire security guards and more closely monitor customers' 
activities, Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the city will drop a lawsuit filed in January in which it sought 
injunctions against the stores under nuisance-abatement statutes, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said Le Sex Shoppes in North Hollywood, Studio City and Canoga Park have 
been "neighborhood problem spots" where numerous arrests for lewd conduct have 
been made in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
The Studio City shop is fighting closure on another front. 
</P>
<P>
Under a city law requiring such shops to be at least 500 feet from residences, 
the shop was scheduled to be closed at the end of March. However, the store's 
owners filed a lawsuit challenging denial of an extension request and were 
given permission to stay open until an April 14 hearing in Los Angeles Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
The city granted the other two shops three-year extensions of the March 
deadline to allow them time to get out of long-term leases.

RACE TO FINISH CONVENTION CENTER ON TIME WILL BE A SQUEAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Expressing confidence that the much-postponed opening of San Diego's new 
$160-million convention center will not be further delayed, the board that 
oversees the bayfront facility predicted Tuesday that shows scheduled at the 
center early next year will go ahead as planned. 
</P>
<P>
With the board members' optimism tempered by caution stemming from the delays 
and false starts that have plagued the project from its inception, the San 
Diego Convention Center Corp. unanimously adopted a resolution stating that an 
Oct. 31 target date for completion of construction "appears to be achievable." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, none of the 11 major conventions and shows scheduled for next 
January and February appear in jeopardy, General Manager Tom Liegler told the 
board. The latest construction timetable, however, means that the center's 
operators will have less than the three-month "shakedown" period they had hoped 
for prior to the first major convention. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Invitations Planned 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, recognizing that some convention organizers feel uneasy about 
planning to hold their events at a still-unfinished center, the board voted to 
invite them to San Diego for an all-expenses-paid effort to convince them that 
the center will, indeed, be completed in time. 
</P>
<P>
"We're confident, but we have to get the (show organizers) to feel confident, 
too," said James Granby, president of the convention center board. "We think 
after they see the progress, they'll feel more comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting provided a more upbeat assessment of the center's outlook 
than the prognosis given last month, when convention center officials warned 
that construction delays at the 760,000-square-foot facility might force 
cancellation of events from November through January. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Shows Canceled 
</P>
<P>
Although two consumer shows that had been tentatively scheduled for November 
have been canceled, several pre-opening parties and other events will be held 
at the center between Nov. 1 and the first major convention Jan. 3, officials 
said Tuesday. Those events include a Thanksgiving weekend open house in which 
San Diegans will be invited to tour the architecturally distinctive center, 
which features flying concrete buttresses and a vinyl, tent-like roof meant to 
evoke images of sails gliding over San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
While relieved -- at least temporarily -- over averting the public-relations 
nightmare that could be expected if the center's first major conventions had to 
be be scrapped, board members emphasized that the Oct. 31 completion date 
leaves them with no margin for error. 
</P>
<P>
"From our point, we've cut this right down to the bone," Granby said. "If we 
can't get in by Oct. 31, we've got major problems. Even a delay of a week or 
two would be very difficult to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finishing Touches 
</P>
<P>
During November and December, tons of equipment must be moved into the center, 
assembled and tested, even as the center's 159-member full-time staff is 
trained and workers put finishing touches on the structure's interior. The 
"Community Celebration" open house and other so-called "soft opening" events 
planned for those two months, meanwhile, will provide test runs for facets of 
the center's operations ranging from parking and traffic control to food 
service and cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no play at all in the schedule," added board member Jim Durbin. 
"There's no cushion as far as those 60 days are concerned. We're down to the 
nitty-gritty." 
</P>
<P>
In a related action that demonstrates further incremental progress toward the 
center's opening, the board also authorized convention center administrators to 
negotiate a contract under which skilled craft personnel will be hired. Bid 
specifications for equipment such as chairs, tables and telescopic risers were 
also approved Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computer Analysis 
</P>
<P>
The Oct. 31 completion date -- two years later than the original goal -- is 
based on a computer analysis of the project that officials of the San Diego 
Unified Port District, the body that is financing the center's construction, 
say reinforces that target. Specifically, that computer study examined roughly 
2,000 construction details that still must be finished at the facility, which 
is more than 80% complete. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, convention center officials have been reassured by the fact that 
construction on the center's 11-acre site, situated on Harbor Drive near 
Seaport Village, is meeting week-by-week progress benchmarks that Liegler 
described as "the critical path . . . to Oct. 31." 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, they know and we don't," Granby said of the port officials 
monitoring the construction. "They're the ones in the best position to know 
whether the schedule can be met. And they tell us it can." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discussed Liability 
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's meeting, the board met in a half-hour closed session to assess 
its legal liability in the event any of the early 1990 conventions would have 
to be canceled because of unanticipated construction delays. Many of the more 
than 50,000 convention delegates expected in January alone already have booked 
hotel rooms, and the trade associations sponsoring those events would find it 
difficult, if not impossible, to relocate their programs on short notice. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Paul Peterson, a lawyer, argued that the invitations to show 
organizers to visit San Diego to get a first-hand look at the center could help 
mitigate the board's financial responsibility if that worst-case scenario comes 
to pass. Those trips -- part of a 10-point plan recommended by Liegler to guide 
the board's activities over the next seven months -- will be financed either by 
the convention center board or the San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau 
(ConVis), which has booked most of the inaugural conventions. 
</P>
<P>
"If the people that come out here are apprised of the situation, they can make 
their own choice whether they want to go forward or not," Peterson said. "As 
long as we've been fair and they make an educated and informed choice, knowing 
all the risks . . . I think that problem will take care of itself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talking to Organizers 
</P>
<P>
ConVis head Dal Watkins, noting that his group has been talking to nervous show 
organizers on a weekly basis, said he believes that the trips will 
significantly enhance that public relations campaign and prompt the officials 
to proceed with plans to stage their events here. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very encouraging sign, because there's a lot at stake here," Watkins 
said. The loss of next January's shows, Watkins noted, would cost the city 
about $8.3 million and would likely precipitate a stampede of other 
cancellations for later events. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's action, however, bolstered the board members' confidence that they 
will not have to confront that unpleasant possibility, as well as demonstrated 
their growing conviction that the major problems that stalled the project 
throughout much of the 1980s are largely behind them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejected by Voters 
</P>
<P>
Controversial from the outset, the convention center proposal was rejected by 
San Diego voters in 1981, but was approved two years later when the site was 
moved from the city's center to the harborfront and the Port District agreed to 
build it. (The city, however, is responsible for any operating deficits.) 
</P>
<P>
Originally targeted for completion in 1987, the project was delayed for a year 
when construction bids came in more than $20 million over the port's estimated 
budget of $101 million to $107 million, prompting the port to seek a second 
round of bids. The new bids produced a $118-million price tag, which since has 
risen to $123 million because of minor changes. The $160 million figure 
includes the cost of equipment, furnishings and other interior accessories. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent construction problems -- among them, excavation delays caused by 
underground water and labor woes in Korea that postponed shipments of 
structural steel -- pushed back the completion date to Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Comfort Level' 
</P>
<P>
"There's always some nervousness in these things . . . but right now there's a 
comfort level that wasn't there 30 days ago," board member Durbin said, adding 
that the Oct. 31 date now looks "more solid" than it did. 
</P>
<P>
While pleased by that shift in perception, Liegler used a homily to remind the 
board of the obstacles that remain to meet that deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the last ounce of effort that usually wins the race," Liegler said. "I 
have to say it feels good to have finally reached that point."

SIMI VOTERS OK FUNDS TO REPAIR SCHOOLS, REJECT GYM MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Simi Valley voters Tuesday approved a $35-million bond issue to renovate aging 
schools and narrowly rejected an $8-million measure that would have provided 
funds to build gymnasiums and an auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Measures A and B had to be approved by more than two-thirds of the voters to 
gain passage. Measure A, which will provide $35 million for new heating and 
air-conditioning systems for the district's 27 schools, passed with 7,096 
votes, or 70.4%. 
</P>
<P>
But Measure B, which would have provided $8 million for new construction, only 
garnered 6,630 votes, or 65.9%, just short of the two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout was a light 21.3% in the special election. There were 48,467 
people eligible to vote, but only 10,309 ballots were cast. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. John Duncan said school officials will decide today whether to ask for a 
recount. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just too close to rely on the machines correctly counting the ballots," 
Duncan said. "What this means is we'll be able to fix our schools and get a tax 
break, but not be able to build anything." 
</P>
<P>
In April, Simi Valley voters rejected a $35-million bond issue by 147 votes. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the district campaigned aggressively for the bond issues. A citizens 
committee supporting the measures recruited more than 200 volunteers, and 
raised more than $6,000 to hire a political consultant and pay for other 
campaign expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Property taxes will decrease with passage of Measure A, Duncan said. 
Legislation sponsored by Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and signed 
into law last month extends the district's repayment of its existing state 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, even with payments for the new bonds, the annual school taxes on a 
$100,000 home will drop from $113 per year to $88 per year. Tax rates will drop 
again after 1994 when the existing state loan is repaid.

VALENCIA ROBBERY SUSPECT ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 22-year-old suspect in a $184,000 Valencia jewelry store robbery was arrested 
Tuesday when sheriff's deputies found him hiding in the closet of a relative's 
mobile home in Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
Tony E. Perrone was one of two men disguised with wigs and false beards who 
threatened to explode a package of dynamite if the clerk of a Zales store on 
McBean Parkway did not fill a bag with jewelry, Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Lt. Ed Chenal said. The robbery occurred at 10:45 a.m. Feb. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Gregory Palmieri said Perrone was arrested Feb. 18, but managed to 
convince investigators that he was not directly involved in the robbery. He 
helped authorities recover about $81,400 worth of jewelry and was released on 
$6,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
Further investigation convinced detectives that Perrone was a key figure in the 
robbery. A warrant was issued for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Perrone eluded arrest, and Palmieri said investigators now believe that he had 
been hiding in Mexico. Investigators said they fear that he sold the 
still-missing jewelry there. 
</P>
<P>
Perrone was being held on suspicion of robbery Tuesday night at the Sheriff's 
Department's Santa Clarita Valley station. Another man, Ronald Walker, of 
Saugus, was arrested Feb. 27 on a robbery charge and remains free on $50,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
Palmieri said members of the Sheriff's Department's COBRA team began watching 
the trailer Monday after receiving a tip that Perrone might be hiding there. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday afternoon, they saw Walker enter the trailer. A short time later, 
Perrone's girlfriend, Julia Belding, 20, left the trailer followed by Walker, 
Palmieri said. 
</P>
<P>
She was stopped for questioning and told deputies that Perrone was in the 
trailer. Belding was arrested on suspicion of aiding and abetting a felon and 
being an accessory to the robbery. Walker was not rearrested. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies from the Sheriff's Department's patrol division, COBRA team and 
narcotics squads knocked on the door but heard no response and forced their way 
in, Palmieri said. They discovered Perrone hiding in a closet behind some 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said they also seized a small amount of cocaine, drug scales, material 
for packaging drugs for sale, syringes and other drug paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
While authorities searched the trailer, Perrone's brother-in-law and sister 
returned to their residence. They were arrested on suspicion of aiding and 
abetting a felon, Palmieri said. 
</P>
<P>
Perrone's sister was identified as Annette Engel, 25. Her husband was 
identified as Timothy Engel, 31.

GREEN MAKES HIS PRESENCE FELT IN LAKER VICTORY OVER HAWKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ATLANTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Please, do not call A.C. Green an enforcer. That label offends his 
sensibilities and might prompt the Lakers' power forward to retaliate. Beware, 
he might even say a prayer that you will choose your words more wisely next 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Green is one of the most docile and devoutly religious players around, but at 
the same time, he is also one of the most ferocious rebounders and physically 
imposing big men battling under the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, the Atlanta Hawks witnessed A.C. Mean, not the tranquil Green, 
and limped away 106-97 losers to the Lakers, before an Omni crowd of 16,371. 
</P>
<P>
Not backing down against the burly presence of Moses Malone and Cliff 
Levingston, Green grabbed 13 rebounds and scored 15 points to help the Lakers 
bounce back strongly against an Eastern Conference bruiser after playing meekly 
in Sunday's loss to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Determined not to back down, Green spent the night jousting and almost coming 
to blows with Malone while Magic Johnson (21 points, 15 assists), James Worthy 
(24 points) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (16 points) were the beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Green's effort, however, did not go unnoticed among his co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley called Green his designated "enforcer," but without the 
surliness usually attached. Mychal Thompson, meanwhile, refers to Green as a 
fierce retaliator. And Orlando Woolridge favorably compared Green's unceasing 
effort to that of Buck Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"A.C. is not an enforcer," Thompson said. "But he's like the U.S. armed forces. 
He doesn't always strike first, but you don't want to get him riled up." 
</P>
<P>
Even Green has trouble defining himself. Better, he said, to just look at the 
effort and the statistics and let it go at that. 
</P>
<P>
"(An enforcer) is somebody who verbally and physically tries to overpower you," 
Green said. "They do more talking than playing, I think. I just try to turn it 
around and do more playing." 
</P>
<P>
So, what would Green call himself, a force-ender, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'm just a typical -- no, I'm not a typical anything -- I'm just a tough 
player," Green said. "I'll let everyone else do the classifications." 
</P>
<P>
Some might call Green, 6-foot-9, 224 pounds, crazy for mixing it up with the 
6-10, 255-pound Malone. But there they were, during the Lakers' final surge, 
trading elbows and forearm bashes in the low post and almost squaring off. 
</P>
<P>
"That's his job," Riley said of Green. "We wanted him to get the rebounds. 
Moses is 250 pounds, and A.C. a skinny 6-9, but I didn't want Moses to get 
position. It was important for us to get the position." 
</P>
<P>
Something had to change in the Lakers' approach after being outrebounded by 18 
and muscled out of their offense in the Houston loss. 
</P>
<P>
The rebounding of Green and others jump-started the Laker fast break, which had 
been missing in action in Sunday's opening game of the trip. Consequently, the 
Lakers made 53.6% of their shots -- 68% in the second quarter -- and were 
outrebounded, only 44-41, by taller and bulkier team. So, even though Malone 
had 16 points and 16 rebounds and Dominique Wilkins led all scorers with 27 
points, the Lakers' consistent effort overcame Atlanta's individual highlights. 
</P>
<P>
It also evened the Laker road record at 15-15 and pulled them three games ahead 
of second-place Phoenix in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a team tonight," said Johnson, who came a rebound shy of another 
triple-double. "It showed. A.C.'s rebounding set the tone at the beginning. It 
was a great lift for us. When he's playing like that, he lifts all of us up. 
A.C. doesn't woof and talk, he just plays aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about A.C. is that he does not allow himself to get boxed out. He 
works hard and rolls away from (opponents). He's an enforcer in the (respect) 
of being an inspirational type. He gives a charge to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Green's atonement Tuesday night for a poor performance in Houston -- eight 
points, nine rebounds, seven turnovers -- began almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
He had seven points and six rebounds in the first quarter, as the Lakers took a 
lead, 30-25, that they only briefly relinquished early in the fourth quarter. A 
typical Green sequence came late in the quarter, when he grabbed an offensive 
rebound and scored inside, then grabbed Malone's missed shot. Thirty seconds 
later, he took a pass from Thompson, was fouled while scoring inside and made 
the free throw. 
</P>
<P>
And, although he did not score a point during the Lakers' 14-2 run late in the 
fourth quarter that turned a 92-90 lead into a 106-92 bulge, Green had two 
important rebounds and once stole the ball from Malone underneath. 
</P>
<P>
"A.C. took the game over by dominating the boards with pure hustle and desire," 
Riley said. "He's as an important a part of our team as anyone else. If he's 
going like that all the time, it opens things up for the rest of our game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Green: "I don't feel responsible to get every single rebound. I just try 
to keep myself around the ball. That usually works. I just try to play as hard 
as possible. That's what I contribute." 
</P>
<P>
It is no small contribution, if you ask Riley. 
</P>
<P>
"A.C. earns his salary maybe more than any other guy," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
On a team with four seven-figure salaried players, Green doesn't make much 
green. He is in the final season of a four-year contract that pays him 
$269,000, ranking him ninth among the 12 Laker players. 
</P>
<P>
Green's agent, Larry Fleisher, already has talked with Jerry West, the Lakers' 
general manager, about a new contract at a significant increase. 
</P>
<P>
But that is another story, Green said. The only numbers he was concerned about 
Tuesday night were the final score and his rebound total. 
</P>
<P>
Both were to his liking. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had trouble on the road, but tonight's game showed that we are getting 
ourselves together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, honored as part of his farewell tour at halftime, was 
presented with the complete jazz library of Warner Bros. records, a replica of 
the statue he was originally given for being named the Naismith Award winner in 
1969 while at UCLA and a portrait of him from a local artist commissioned by 
Hawk owner Ted Turner, who took part in the ceremony. The Lakers improved their 
record to 6-8 on ceremony nights. . . . Abdul-Jabbar scored 12 of his 16 points 
in the first half. . . . Orlando Woolridge had only two points and three 
rebounds, but two of the rebounds came midway through the fourth quarter with 
the Lakers clinging to a slim lead and A.C. Green on the bench. Said Woolridge: 
"A.C.'s a great rebounder, and when I watch him, it inspires me. (Coach Pat 
Riley) has wanted me to be more aggressive in going to the offensive and 
defensive boards. I'm concentrating more on being in the low post. My game used 
to be more offensive oriented."

AS A KNICK, KIKI VANDEWEGHE IS FOLLOWING IN FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN GOLDSTEIN, Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Kiki Vandeweghe, the chance to play for the New York Knicks, after spending 
his first nine pro basketball seasons in Denver and Portland, was an 
opportunity to carry on a rich family tradition. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Dr. Ernie Vandeweghe, was a popular guard for the Knicks in the 
early '50s, known for his relentless hustle and unselfish play. 
</P>
<P>
Kiki is a more gifted scorer than his father and should have a chance to win 
over the New York fans now that All-Star playmaker Mark Jackson will be lost 
indefinitely with a knee injury that may require arthroscopic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a good inside game with Patrick Ewing," said General Manager Al 
Bianchi, "and you try to surround that with as many good outside shooters as 
you can get. It's especially important in the playoffs when the game gets 
reduced to a half-court game. People talk about defense, but the bottom lime is 
putting the ball into the basket. 
</P>
<P>
"With Kiki, I had no concern about how he would fit in with us. I've known him 
for years. Johnny Newman and Kenny Walker wouldn't be human if they didn't 
wonder how bringing in another small forward would affect their role. But 
they're the type who can handle it." 
</P>
<P>
In his second appearance for the Knicks, March 2, Vandeweghe scored 23 points 
in 24 minutes against the Miami Heat. He is being used in a supporting role to 
Newman, but he is cutting into the minutes of Walker, an inconsistent shooter. 
</P>
<P>
Without Jackson, however, the Knicks will be hard-pressed to maintain one of 
the four best records in the Eastern Conference and gain a home-court advantage 
in the playoffs. They are being pressured from behind by Milwaukee and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"Losing Mark is like cutting off your head," Coach Rick Pitino said. "It will 
be a very difficult experience, but we have a lot of confidence in (rookie) Rod 
Strickland. If he can hold up stamina-wise, he'll be all right and so will we." 
</P>
<P>
When the 1988-89 college season began, the top-ranked seniors by National 
Basketball Association scouts were Stacey King of Oklahoma, Pervis Ellison of 
Louisville, Sean Elliott of Arizona, Danny Ferry of Duke and Glen Rice of 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
But scouts have re-evaluated the blue-chippers, with Ellison falling out of 
favor and Ferry now being viewed as no worse than a second choice. 
</P>
<P>
"Trouble with Ellison is that he seldom breaks a sweat," said one NBA scout, 
preferring anonymity. "Right now, I'd rate King and Ferry 1 and 1A. Both could 
play center for certain pro teams, but Ferry's great passing ability makes him 
more valuable as a forward." 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting scenario, of course, would have the Washington Bullets 
involved in the 1989 NBA lottery, winning the first pick and forcing General 
Manager Bob Ferry to decide whether to choose his well-rounded son or King, a 
more prolific scorer and superior shot blocker. 
</P>
<P>
It just might make sense for Ferry to serve as Danny's agent. Who knows better 
how to negotiate multi-million dollar contracts? 
</P>
<P>
With a shortage of proven big men among the 1989 graduating class, it is 
expected that juniors J.R. Reid of North Carolina, Dwayne Schintzius of Florida 
and Derrick Coleman of Syracuse will declare themselves eligible for the draft. 
Otherwise, look for NBA teams to take a first-round gamble on the likes of 
UConn's Cliff Robinson, 6-10, and Joe Calavita of Vermont, who ordinarily might 
be second-round selections. 
</P>
<P>
First-round sleepers: Arizona forward Anthony Cook, Houston forward Richard 
Hollis, Wisconsin guard Trent Jackson and Seton Hall forward Daryll Walker. 
</P>
<P>
One Grant too many: On draft day last June, Chicago forward Horace Grant was 
hoping the Bulls would draft his twin brother, Harvey, of Oklahoma. Picking 
right before the Bullets, the Bulls selected center Will Perdue of Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought with (Bulls forward) Scottie Pippen hurt, the Bulls might pick me," 
Harvey said. "But I really didn't want to play in Chicago because I didn't want 
to get caught up with people saying, 'Harvey had this kind of year. Now it's 
your turn.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dutch treat: While the Indiana Pacers rank as one of the season's major busts, 
the rapid improvement of rookie center Rik Smits, the native of the Netherlands 
who played at Marist College, bodes well for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing I've done is to get the other guys to accept Rik," Coach 
Dick Versace said. "I told them, 'You're witnessing the changing of the guard 
at center. This kid is a worker. And, until further notice, I expect you to get 
him the ball.' " 
</P>
<P>
Detroit playmaker Isiah Thomas is being credited with being the man behind the 
scenes in the acquisition of his Chicago pal Mark Aguirre from Dallas in 
exchange for Adrian Dantley. Said Dallas TV analyst Bob Weiss: "If the Pistons 
win the title, should Isiah be voted NBA Executive of the Year?"

<P>
As his team's lead slowly boiled down from eight to four to two points late in 
the second half Sunday at the Towson Center, the toothy, gray-headed, 
pigeon-toed Hofstra University basketball coach was a grimacing, gum-chewing, 
ref-baiting dervish. 
</P>
<P>
His face grew redder, his voice taut. Bucknell students shouted at him in a 
manner you would not wish on your ex-wife's divorce lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
He endured that not because he needed the victory or the thrill, or because he 
had a point to prove. He is 64, old, a content grandfather, and this was the 
29th game of his 35th season as a coach, including the years he coached Bill 
Bradley and Princeton to the Final Four, coached Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry 
West and the Los Angeles Lakers to the National Basketball Association 
championship series, and, later, coached the girls team at a little Mississippi 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
This is a man who could walk away from coaching with nary a regret, which, even 
he would admit, is an idea with some merit. Certainly, his patient, halfcourt 
style is an anomaly in the fastbreaking, three-pointing modern game. He also 
has trouble with an irregular heartbeat, most recently during a game 13 months 
ago. And if he walked away, he wouldn't have to spend the winter in campus 
housing, as he has this season. 
</P>
<P>
But at this point, no body of evidence is powerful enough to persuade Butch van 
Breda Kolff to retire. Sure, he will be the oldest Division I coach when Oregon 
State's Ralph Miller retires after this season. Sure, he thinks about spending 
his winters crabbing and clamming off the Florida coast. ("It has to come to 
that sooner or later.") But it is no use. Inside him somewhere is a driving, 
lively spirit that keeps him from doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"You do what you like to do," he said after the game Sunday, wearing the wry 
smile that governs his countenance away from the court. "This is fun. I like 
the game, the competition, being around kids. That keeps you young. When you 
come across good kids, that's why I'm still here." 
</P>
<P>
Here, after all this time, is back where he started years ago, literally at the 
same schools, coaching before small crowds in little college gyms, waiting for 
bigger schools to recruit the best players so he can pick over what is left. He 
could be excused for longing for brighter lights, bigger cities and an 
occasional television timeout. But that is no longer the lure. 
</P>
<P>
"I like this," he said. "I like the other, too. You have to like the pros on 
the first and 15th (paydays). I liked (coaching) the girls, too. It's all the 
same. The reward is teaching them a style and watching them learn it. Winning 
is important, but not as much as when I was younger. For me now it's almost 
more important to see them playing well. Not that I don't like to win once they 
are." 
</P>
<P>
Such was the lure of Hofstra, which was 6-21 a year ago. Van Breda Kolff 
arrived from Lafayette, where he developed a conference champion in four years, 
but was discouraged by the administration's attitude toward athletics. 
"Majoring in mediocrity," he called it, as blunt as ever. 
</P>
<P>
Some thought that he was growing daffy with age, for he also had moved from 
Lafayette to Hofstra 33 years earlier, in the first of his many career changes 
(he has been hired 12 times, coached in three pro leagues, including one for 
women, and won 726 college and pro games). But he was not exercising some 
bizarre desire to duplicate his career decades later. He just needed a new 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
At Hofstra, he found one. He inherited the same players of 6-21 fame, minus the 
star, Frankie Walker, gone for the season with broken bones in his feet. The 
first practice was horrifying. "I thought we were in big trouble," van Breda 
Kolff said. 
</P>
<P>
As always, he applied his patient style. Modern players are accused of wanting 
to fastbreak and fastbreak only, but van Breda Kolff found players anxious to 
embrace his ways. "Why should they resist?" he said. "They were 6-21. And 
anyway, if you take the time to show them this way, they find it's fun." 
</P>
<P>
The Flying Dutchmen, as they are known, lost six of their first nine games, 
steadied, then lost four in a row to fall to 7-13. Then they came together, 
winning six of their last seven regular season games and defeating Drexel in 
the first round of the East Coast Conference tournament Saturday at the Towson 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
That brought them to Sunday's semifinal with Bucknell, the ECC regular season 
champion. The Flying Dutchmen fell behind 17-4, but shot well and rallied. They 
took the lead before halftime and held it through much of the second half. Had 
they maintained it, they would have been one game from a National Collegiate 
Athletic Association tournament berth. 
</P>
<P>
But Bucknell slowly bit into the lead, finally caught up in the last minute and 
forced overtime. The Flying Dutchmen hurried some shots, fell behind and lost. 
The season was over. Van Breda Kolff's face was a portrait of dismay late in 
the game, but he smiled easily afterwards. After 35 years, no game is too 
galling. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost a little discipline (at the end)," he said. "But it's hard to be 
upset. The kids played like hell. They've come so far since October it's 
unbelievable. I'm lucky to come to a new school and find such a good group. I 
feel bad for them (losing). Me, I've won a lot and lost a lot." 
</P>
<P>
After the recruiting season, he will spend his summer at his house on the 
Jersey shore, taking long walks on the beach in the morning. He has lost 30 
pounds since his last episode of heart trouble, mostly from cutting out beer. 
"I might start jogging," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Unless a whim grabs him, he will be back in campus housing and back for another 
season in October. Frankie Walker should be healthy, and the notion of beating 
teams with patience in 1989 is the kind of challenge that keeps him interested. 
How long can he keep the fire lighted? "I don't know," van Breda Kolff said, 
"and I don't care. I play everything by ear."

CLARK IS MAKING HIS DRIVE FOR SPOT IN PADRES' OUTFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerald Clark, age 25, having spent four years in college and four more in 
professional baseball, has already decided what he's going to do if he opens 
this season as an outfielder with the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
He's going to buy a car: his first. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what kind of car," Clark said softly, the only way he says 
anything. "Just as long as I can look on the salesman's contract and see my 
name on it and know that it's mine." 
</P>
<P>
First thing he will do in that car is go find Isiah and Phillip. Those are his 
two brothers who also play pro baseball. They both have cars. They were both 
first-round June draft picks in recent years and signed for bonuses of more 
than $100,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
When Jerald signed with the Padres as a 12th-round pick in 1985 out of tiny 
Crockett, Tex., he was given just over $1,000. He immediately spent the money 
on college tuition in case he wouldn't be good enough to make the minor 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"My brothers have nice cars, an Audi, a Mazda," Clark said. "You know how you 
sometimes dream of something? I've always dreamed of just having my own car 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
Next thing he might do is drive to the Mervyn's department store in Las Vegas. 
That was his most recent place of employment. He worked there this winter, in 
home fashions, selling linens and housewares. At 6-feet-4, 190 pounds of tight 
muscle, he was perhaps the biggest Afghan salesman in retail history. 
</P>
<P>
"You get no bonus, and try to live just on minor league money; you have to get 
a job," Clark said. "But it wasn't so bad. I bet you didn't know that 200 
thread sheets are a little better than the 180 thread sheets." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, while in Las Vegas, he will probably pull that car in front of the 
Scandia Fun Center. There, amid the miniature golf course, video machines and 
mini-car track, is where he worked on the batting swing that could change his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"They have some batting cages there, 25 balls for $1.25, that's where I spent 
my winter," Clark explained. "The pitching machines are old, so you never know 
where the ball is going, so you have to be quick with the bat. We'd go down, 
hit a few rounds, play a little golf, drive them fast cars and hit some more." 
</P>
<P>
And today the "hit" is him. The unassuming man with the huge swing has become 
the darling of this camp, playing and acting his way into the hearts of coaches 
and teammates, most of whom before now had barely heard of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see, who are the candidates for the final outfield spot? Shawn Abner and 
Shane Mack, right? Oh yeah, and maybe Thomas Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 That was before. Now, when talking about the fifth outfielder, there is only 
one name mentioned, and it is triple-A star Clark, who thus far has gone six 
for 11 with four RBIs in a combination of three "A" and "B" games. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't a great fielder. He doesn't always run smart. But the Padres say they 
can fix those things. What Clark does, besides hit, is work and listen and work 
some more until he's now got the Padre bosses believing one of their easiest 
job this spring will be turning him into a big league outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
"I go home at night after working with Jerald and think, 'Gee, if I could just 
have 24 of him," coach Greg Riddoch said. "So many young people can learn from 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Clark's emergence and the demise of the trade talks with Atlanta for slugger 
Dale Murphy have combined to make the Padre bosses even consider giving him 
special attention. Look for Amos Otis, the Padre hitting coach and three-time 
Gold Glove outfielder, to begin tutoring Clark on playing the outfield, an area 
that still seems uncomfortable to the former Lamar (Tex.) University first 
baseman. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd much rather teach fielding to a guy who can hit than the other way 
around," Otis said. "Jerald just needs to learn how to be quicker after the 
ball, and we can teach that. He has good work habits, which makes it easier. 
He's the kind of guy coaches love." 
</P>
<P>
And the kind that teammates see and appreciate. While Clark was conducting his 
first extended interview recently, he was approached by shortstop and captain 
Garry Templeton. 
</P>
<P>
"You get asked any funny questions now, you come tell me, and I'll take care of 
it," Templeton said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks for your concern, Garry," Clark replied seriously. 
</P>
<P>
He's serious, and low-key, about most things. This despite hitting better than 
.300 in each of his four minor-league seasons, including .301 with nine homers 
and 67 RBIs at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen what baseball can do to you, I've realized what a blessing it is 
just to be here," Clark said. "I know I'm no better than anybody else, probably 
worse, because for the Padres to let me go, it wouldn't be any big deal. They 
haven't invested any money in me anyway. This humbles you." 
</P>
<P>
So does having two baseball-playing brothers. While infielder Isiah, 22, and 
catcher Phillip, 20, are both younger, Clark has learned much from them. 
</P>
<P>
Isiah was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the first round in 1984. But he 
never panned out. He was traded to Oakland, released by Oakland, and recently 
picked up by the Padres' minor-league operation, which will evaluate his 
chances this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the year Isiah was drafted out of high school, Jerald was picked 
out of college in the 27th round by the Dodgers and offered around $3,500. 
Isiah felt so bad because of the differences in their bonus offers, "He told me 
he would negotiate for more money and give me some," Jerald recalled sadly. "I 
told him to keep it. Now, I'm the one taking him to dinner, giving him 
equipment, doing things for him." 
</P>
<P>
Phillip was drafted in the first round by Detroit in 1986, and has gone the 
other direction. He was the Tigers' minor league Player of the Year while 
catching for Class-A Lakeland last summer, and could advance as far as triple A 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Along with oldest brother, John, the four Clarks used to do everything together 
in their small Texas town, where their father, Jesse, is still one of the local 
plumbers. They slept in the same room, crammed into the family's only bathroom 
at the same time in the mornings and together learned to play baseball with old 
milk cartons. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jerald Clark didn't appear in the Padres' first spring defeat Tuesday, a 3-1 
loss to Milwaukee, which dropped the team to 4-1. Another young Padre 
outfielder, Randell Byers, blew a fourth-inning fly ball by LaVel Freeman that 
first became a triple, then an instant later became the game's final run when 
second baseman Joey Cora threw wildly on the relay to third base. None of the 
young Padre outfielders have been impressive in the field this spring, which 
led Manager Jack McKeon to observe, "It seems all anyone cares about these days 
is hitting, hitting. To make this team, our backup outfielders are going to 
have to be good fielders. We may need to do a little review on this." . . . The 
loss, absorbed by Bruce Hurst who allowed three earned runs in four innings, 
was harder to swallow because the Brewers' team had only one big-league 
starter, designated-hitter Glenn Braggs. . . . The Padres also didn't look so 
swell in the morning "B" game against the California Angels, as reliever Dave 
Leiper allowed four consecutive hits with two out in the eighth to give the 
Angels a 5-4 victory. Starter Greg Booker, vying for the right-handed stopper 
role, looked good, allowing just two unearned runs in four innings.

Forward Rod Higgins hit a trio of three-point goals, and Chris Mullin and Mitch 
Richmond scored 12 points apiece in a 50-point fourth quarter to lead the 
Golden State Warriors to a 138-112 victory over the Clippers Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors trailed, 89-88, going into the final quarter, but Golden State ran 
up its second-highest quarter total in franchise history to break open the game 
inasmuch as the Clippers managed only 23 points during the same span. The 
Warriors scored on 23 consecutive possessions during their hot fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the 13th in a row for the Clippers, who have also dropped 32 of 
their last 33 games and are 2-33 on the road this season. 
</P>
<P>
Mullin led the Warrior attack with 31 points, and Richmond added 28. Higgins 
scored 15 points in less than one half of play. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Ken Norman of the Clippers had a career-high 38 points to lead all 
scorers. Guard Quintin Dailey, moved back into a starting role, added 21

NEWMAN, EWING LEAD KNICKS PAST SUNS, 124-119 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some were suggesting that with the acquisition of Kiki Vandeweghe, Johnny 
Newman would be replaced as starting small forward for the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
Such talk, however, did not bother Newman, a third-year forward from Richmond, 
Va. He continued to play a major role in the Knicks' resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
His playing time was reduced a bit when Vandeweghe joined the team. But in the 
last two games, Newman has been instrumental in New York's success. 
</P>
<P>
Newman's steal and breakaway dunk Tuesday night gave the Knicks the lead for 
good with three minutes left and they went on to beat the Phoenix Suns, 
124-119. It was the third consecutive victory for the Knicks, who improved 
their home record to 27-1. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing, taking charge in the absence of injured playmaker Mark Jackson, 
scored 18 of his 40 points in the fourth quarter to help stop the Suns. He was 
17 for 22 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Newman, playing 30 minutes, had 23 points and five assists. In the four games 
since Vandeweghe joined the club, he is 26 for 43 from the field and has scored 
70 points. 
</P>
<P>
"The rumors and the subsequent signing didn't bother me," Newman said. "I think 
it was a smart move to get a veteran sharpshooter. I didn't worry because I 
feel the Knicks think of me when they think of the future. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can do is continue to play hard." 
</P>
<P>
Newman was a second-round pick in the 1986 draft. He was released after playing 
59 games as a rookie and signed by the Knicks. Although he saw more action in 
his second season, he shot only 43.5%. This season, he suddenly developed. 
</P>
<P>
He has averaged more than 16 points a game for the Knicks, who are 40-19 and 
lead the Atlantic Division by eight games. A year ago, after 59 games, the 
Knicks were 25-34. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing's development is also a big factor. When the fourth quarter opened, the 
Knicks led by four. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark told me to go out there and win it," Ewing said. "The game was on the 
line and it was time for me to take control. I can do that now." 
</P>
<P>
Vandeweghe played 19 minutes and had only eight points coming off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Chambers had 31 points for the Suns, who fell three games behind the Lakers 
in the Atlantic Division. They are only a half-game ahead of third-place 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 105, Sacramento 95 -- In the absence of the Cavaliers' other big men, 
6-11 John Williams took charge for the Cavaliers at Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Daugherty, a 7-footer, is out with a hand injury and 7-1 Tree Rollins 
became a father Tuesday. Williams, with help from guards Mark Price and Ron 
Harper, made sure the Cavaliers' losing streak ended at two games. 
</P>
<P>
All three scored 20 points and enabled the Cavaliers to pull away in the 
closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 90, Chicago 88 -- Derek Smith, one of the stars of the league just 
a few years ago, made an auspicious first start for the 76ers at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, signed last month after being released by Sacramento, made a layup with 
one second remaining to end the 76ers' three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Smith finished with 13 points on a night when Charles Barkley also had 13 
points, but 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan had 34 points and 11 rebounds for the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 121, Washington 101 -- Sidney Moncrief, in one of his best games in 
an injury-filled season, helped the Bucks end the Bullets' four-game winning 
streak at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Moncrief scored 10 of his 20 points in a brief spurt in the second half that 
broke open a close game. 
</P>
<P>
His three-point shot to end the third quarter was followed by seven consecutive 
points to start the last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 116, San Antonio 103 -- Terry Porter had 25 points and Clyde Drexler 
20 at San Antonio as the Trail Blazers beat the Spurs for the 10th consecutive 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs have lost 14 of their last 15. They lost this one despite Frank 
Brickowski's 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
They were only five points behind when Porter scored five points in a 12-2 
rally that broke it open. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 110, Indiana 92 -- Dale Ellis scored 13 of his 27 points in the fourth 
quarter at Indianapolis to break open a tight game. 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics led by only six points after three quarters, but scored the 
first six points of the fourth quarter and romped to their third consecutive 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Former UCLA star Reggie Miller, who had 36 points and 29 in recent Pacer road 
victories, was one for 13 from the field and had only eight points. DAN HAFNER

FLENER PITCHES TITANS PAST PEPPERDINE, 7-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huck Flener allowed seven hits over 7 1/3 innings and Cal State Fullerton made 
the most of its opportunities to post a 7-2 victory Tuesday at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
Flener, a sophomore left-hander, improved to 4-0 by holding Pepperdine (9-8-1) 
scoreless until the sixth inning. By then, the Titans had taken a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans took a 2-0 lead in the first inning when Rex Peters doubled home one 
run and scored the other. Peters has a hit in all 17 Fullerton games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (11-6) scored three times in the third, thanks in part to pitcher 
John Kuzmic's wildness. 
</P>
<P>
Kuzmic hit Mate Borgogno with a pitch to open the inning, committed a balk and 
threw a wild pitch before walking Peters and Brent Mayne. David Staton hit a 
two-run single and later scored on a double by Randy Graves. 
</P>
<P>
Borgogno singled home a run in the sixth and scored on Mayne's sacrifice fly to 
cap the Titans' scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Flener left with runners on first and third and one out in the eighth. But 
Chris Robinson got Jim Doyle to hit into a double play, then struck out two 
batters in pitching a perfect ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
In a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball game: 
</P>
<P>
Chapman College 9, Cal State Northridge 3 -- Rod Turner hit two home runs and 
had three RBIs, and Mike Grahovac knocked in two runs with two doubles for 
visiting Chapman (10-10, 4-1). David Bird pitched his third consecutive 
complete game in conference play. Northridge is 10-3, 3-2.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
TITANS ARE IN THE RUNNING FOR AN AWARD-WINNING FINISH TO SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton's basketball team finished the regular season in a 
three-way tie for fourth place in the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
But when the conference announces the winners of its top awards today, the 
Titans have a prominent candidate for all three major awards. 
</P>
<P>
The awards are chosen by conference coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cedric Ceballos, who led the conference in scoring with a 20.6-point 
average and was second in rebounding with an 8.7 average, is one of two 
prominent candidates for the player of the year award. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Las Vegas' Stacey Augmon is the other top candidate. Augmon wasn't among 
the top 10 scorers, but he was fifth in rebounding with a 7.4 average. Augmon 
has a couple of big factors in his favor, though. He was a member of the U.S. 
Olympic basketball team, and his UNLV team won the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
"Cedric was conference player of the week twice, and nobody else did that," 
Fullerton Coach John Sneed said. "But I think the team that wins the 
championship deserves to win an honor like this." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sneed is one of the prominent choices for coach of the year, after guiding 
the Titans to a 15-12 regular-season record after being named acting coach in 
November. The chief competition is Neil McCarthy, who guided New Mexico State 
to a 19-9 record and second place in the conference. Bill Berry of San Jose 
State also might get some support, as a vote of confidence from his peers after 
a midseason walkout of 10 players. 
</P>
<P>
"That award isn't for me to decide," Sneed said. "That's for your own peers to 
decide. If you win that, that means something. It's voted on by people who 
really understand what you do." 
</P>
<P>
Sneed said he is impressed with McCarthy's job this season. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been the hottest team in the conference lately," he said. "They're the 
only team that swept us." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wayne Williams, the Titans' point guard, is a candidate for freshman of the 
year. Williams is averaging 8.4 points, but his season is best remembered for 
his court leadership at point guard, which Sneed said is "the hardest position 
for a high school player to learn." And, of course, he's remembered for the 
30-foot shot he sank to beat UNLV in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The competition apparently is Kendall Youngblood of Utah State, another 
freshman point guard, and Wilbert Hooker of Fresno State, a shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker has the best numbers. He is averaging 11.4 points and 3.1 rebounds a 
game. Youngblood is close behind at 10.8 points and 4.4 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton women's basketball team might have done worse than to draw San 
Diego State in the first round Thursday, despite the fact that the Aztecs are 
23-7 and have been ranked in the top 20 this season. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton has owned San Diego State lately, beating the Aztecs in the past five 
meetings, including twice this season.

OCC WINS FIRST CONFERENCE GAME;

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange Coast College finally got its first Orange Empire Conference baseball 
victory with a 7-3 decision over Saddleback Tuesday at Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
OCC (11-4-1), expected to contend for the conference title with Cypress, lost 
its first three conference games before Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback had early leads of 1-0 and 3-2, before OCC scored two runs in the 
sixth, and never trailed again. 
</P>
<P>
OCC's Scott Talanoa opened the sixth with his fifth home run of the season. 
Craig Nixon later had a sacrifice fly to give OCC a 4-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates got two more runs in the seventh on a bases-loaded walk to Darrel 
Conner. Jason Young later scored on a wild pitch.

SADDLEBACK COMES UP SHORT ON LAST PLAY, LOSES BY 1 POINT

<P>
Saddleback and Fresno Edison high schools matched slashing moves to the basket 
and gritty hustle for nearly all of their first-round Division I Southern 
California Regional playoff game Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But Saddleback let one 5-second lapse ruin its chance for a stirring victory. 
Instead, the Roadrunners were left to ponder a 63-62 loss to Edison before a 
standing-room-only crowd at Edison. 
</P>
<P>
And the final 5 seconds will long remain in the memories of the Roadrunners. 
</P>
<P>
In that span, Saddleback, leading, 62-61, watched Edison guard Sean Stell drive 
the length of the court and hit a five-foot bank shot at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
No one stepped in his path to cut off Stell and as a result the Roadrunners are 
out of the regionals. 
</P>
<P>
After going through most of the season with just one loss, the Roadrunners 
finished with two in a row. Saddleback, which lost in the Southern Section 5-AA 
game to Millikan, 62-59, in overtime Saturday finished its season 27-2. 
</P>
<P>
Edison (22-6) advances to play Crenshaw in the semifinals Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to make the ball go into the front court and make a wall and not let 
them go into the middle," Saddleback Coach Pat Quinn said. "That's exactly what 
didn't happen. Everybody stood around and hoped the horn would go off." 
</P>
<P>
Stell's shot swished through with 1 second left, then the horn sounded. Stell 
was mobbed by teammates and fans at center court. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to say it, but it was exactly what we wanted," Edison Coach Bill Engel 
said. "For once something we drew up worked." 
</P>
<P>
Said Stell, who scored 16 points: "All night they had been giving me the inside 
shots like that one and I was passing off. This time I just pulled up and shot 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The jumper was the third, and final, lead change in the last minute of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Twice Saddleback, undaunted by a long bus ride and a distinct home-court 
disadvantage in the Tigers' noisy gym, rallied from big deficits. The first 
time the Roadrunners cut a 12-point Edison lead down to six in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Saddleback trailed by eight early in the fourth quarter, but slowly 
chipped away at the lead. Key baskets by center Malru Dottin and forward Craig 
Marshall got the Roadrunners close. And when guard Sean Simon made a 10-foot 
jumper, Saddleback took the lead, 54-53, with 3:33 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Roadrunners extended it to 58-53 on a driving layup by Dottin and a 
fast-break basket by Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
Dottin had 11 points, but fouled out with 1:56 left. Marshall led Saddleback 
with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
Edison, led by guard Bruce Bowen's 26 points, didn't fade, however. Trailing, 
60-57, Stell hit two free throws with 1:07 left. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback's Tony Agnew lost the ball out of bounds with 56 seconds left, 
giving Edison possession. Stell made a 12-foot jumper in the lane with 43 
seconds left, giving Edison a 61-60 lead. His shot bounced three times on the 
rim before finally falling through the net. 
</P>
<P>
But Elton Moore gave Saddleback the lead right back, 62-61, with 7 seconds 
left. Moore took advantage of a defensive breakdown, slipping past Edison 
defenders for an easy layup. 
</P>
<P>
Edison then called timeout and set up Stell's game-winner.

CAPISTRANO VALLEY MISSES ON ITS FINAL OPPORTUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a play designed to get the ball to hot-shooting forward Scott McCorkle 
for a three-point shot that would tie the score and send the game into 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
It would have capped a furious fourth-quarter rally in which Capistrano Valley 
had overcome a 16-point deficit against the defending state champion, Manual 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
But McCorkle never got the opportunity to try that shot. Teammate Nick Kost 
threw the ball away with 19 seconds remaining before the Cougars could get past 
midcourt and Manual Arts hung on for a 69-63 victory in the first round of the 
Southern California Regional Division I playoffs Tuesday night in front of 
2,000 at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the momentum, but we didn't take care of the ball," said Mark Thornton, 
Capistrano Valley coach. "Throwing the ball away was the killer." 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts (25-1) made 16 free throws in the final quarter, including a pair 
by guard Marcel Capers with 6 seconds remaining, to move into the second round 
on Thursday night at Freemont. 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts suffered its only loss of the season, 85-72, to Crenshaw in the 
City 4-A division championship game last Friday. But the Toilers rebounded with 
a fine defensive effort and some excellent outside shooting that enabled them 
to snap Capistrano Valley's 15-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley (24-5) appeared to be hopelessly behind heading into the 
final quarter. The Cougars had managed to score only 13 points in the second 
and third quarters and their best player, McCorkle, was in a shooting slump. 
</P>
<P>
McCorkle had gained two quick fouls in the first quarter and played only 1:34 
of the first half. He struggled to find his shooting touch when he returned in 
the third quarter, hitting only two of eight field goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he (Thornton) might bring him back in the second quarter," said 
Randolph Simpson, Manual Arts coach. "When he finally got back in, it took him 
a while to get going because he sat so long." 
</P>
<P>
But once McCorkle got into a groove, Capistrano Valley rallied. The talented 
junior hit three-pointers, drove for three-point plays and swished jump shots 
off screens. He sank six consecutive shots, including a follow with 3:45 
remaining that moved the Cougars within three points, 59-56. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy shoots off the screen better than anybody I've ever seen," Simpson 
said. "I thought we were in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley moved closer, 62-60, when guard Bill Mazurie scored his 31st 
point on a follow shot, but Capers answered with a driving layup and a pair of 
free throws to move Manual Arts comfortably ahead, 66-60. 
</P>
<P>
But Capistrano Valley guard Chris Kostoff made a three-point shot with 36 
seconds remaining to cut Manual Arts' lead to 66-63, and when the Toilers were 
guilty of a turnover 7 seconds later, Thornton called a timeout to set up what 
he hoped would be a game-tying shot. 
</P>
<P>
"We were down, but I hadn't given up because we're pretty good shooters," 
Thornton said. "But we never got a chance to take that shot." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson knows all about being down. Manual Arts had been ranked No. 1 in the 
state all season when it all fell apart against Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big letdown, and sometimes it's hard to pick yourself up again when 
you have a big letdown," Simpson said. "This game will help us. The kids want 
to redeem themselves and get another shot at Crenshaw."

So coach, you say this was only Chris Enger's second-best effort? 
</P>
<P>
"She played better against Mt. Carmel last year in the playoffs," Vista Coach 
Joe DeMaria said about his star center's performance Tuesday night against 
visiting Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
This was after watching the Panthers defeat Canyon, 80-38, in the first round 
of the Southern California Regional Division II girls' basketball playoffs. 
Enger scored 43 points. 
</P>
<P>
Enger couldn't precisely remember that Mt. Carmel game last year but memories 
of this one were still vivid. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best we've played in the playoffs so far," said Enger, whose 
career high is 44. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we could win, but not like this. When you're talking playoffs, 
everyone's good. No way did I think that we'd blow them out like that." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from a close first quarter -- Vista, after being down, 8-3, took a 12-10 
lead into the second quarter -- Canyon (22-6) wasn't even in the same gym. 
</P>
<P>
Enger started off with four points in the first quarter, then became a scoring 
machine for the next 16 minutes of play, scoring 20 and 15 points in the second 
and third quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"We started getting the ball to her on the weak side," DeMaria said. "That 
seemed to open it up and Kelli (Schott) got some shots for us." 
</P>
<P>
Said Enger: "Kelli and everyone got me the ball. Everyone always contributes." 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Vista (26-3) switched from a zone to man-to-man defense after the 
first quarter -- "That seemed to help," said DeMaria -- and ran a fast break 
that broke Canyon fast. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't defend against us a lot," said Enger. "We just beat them up on the 
break. That really opened it up for us." 
</P>
<P>
Vista led, 35-22, at the half and pushed the margin wider with a 29-9 
third-quarter run. In that period, Canyon's only field goals were on 
three-pointers from Christa Ramirez -- one with 3 seconds left -- and one from 
Keri Erkenbrack. 
</P>
<P>
Erkenbrack (21) and Ramirez (7) were questionable for the game, both having 
been injured in a Southern Section soccer game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
News of the injuries filtered down to Vista's players, and they weren't taken 
seriously, according to Enger. 
</P>
<P>
"They are their top scorers," she said. "If they're athletes, they'll be out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
DeMaria began substituting late in the third quarter but didn't take Enger out 
until she set the gym record with 3:10 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring in double figures for Vista, which advances to Thursday's second round, 
were Schott with 17 and Dana Christofferson with 11. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Coach Bill Fitzgibbons said his players did a good job of defending 
against Enger early but had problems thereafter.

SAN MARCOS CAN'T STAND PRESSURE AS KATELLA DOES IT WITH DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Steals usually are a good measure of a basketball team's defensive domination. 
</P>
<P>
The Katella High School girls' basketball team had 18 of them Tuesday night in 
its 56-39 victory over San Marcos in the first round of the Southern California 
Regional Division II playoffs in front of about 900 at Katella. 
</P>
<P>
Katella plays Muir, which defeated Bakersfield North on Tuesday, in a semifinal 
game Thursday at Katella. 
</P>
<P>
Katella's full-court press and aggressive zone defense were so frustrating, San 
Marcos shot five airballs and turned the ball over 16 times in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos shot 27% from the field for the game. Katella shot 40%. 
</P>
<P>
"Our strong point definitely is our defense," Katella Coach Barb Bausch said. 
"If it's not there, nothing else is going to be. We get pumped more when we can 
shut them down." 
</P>
<P>
Katella generates its offense from its defense and from guard Joni Easterly, 
who scored a school-record 36 points on 12-of-20 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
She broke her record of 34 points set Thursday in the Knights' 4-A championship 
victory over Muir. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly, a senior who has signed to play for USC, has raised her game a level 
for the playoffs because she "feels she has to." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the girls don't have as much experience so they get nervous," she 
said. "I need to break the ice with my shooting. That is kind of my role." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bausch: "She's definitely more intense (in the playoffs). She knows it's 
do or die and any game could be her last, so she is always going to be up." 
</P>
<P>
Katella, which led, 12-11, after the first quarter, broke the game open in the 
second quarter with six unanswered points to lead, 18-11. 
</P>
<P>
Susie O'Brien, the San Diego Section's leading scorer averaging 29.9 points, 
started the quarter by turning the ball over as she was double-teamed on the 
baseline. 
</P>
<P>
Katella's Margaret Harker capitalized, scoring on a jumper. Then San Marcos' 
Shantell Paopao shot back-to-back airballs. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly scored a field goal then stole the ball seconds later to set up 
teammate Karen Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos did not make a field goal in the quarter and trailed 37-25 at the 
end of the quarter. O'Brien accounted for the team's only points with eight 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Katella increased its lead to as many as 20 points, 56-36, late in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien connected on 10 of 32 shots and scored 28 points, but 10 of those came 
in the fourth quarter with Katella's lead already in double digits. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense was tough," O'Brien said. "I couldn't do any baseline drives like 
I like to do. I couldn't put the ball on the floor. It changed my rhythm."

CSUN WOMEN SWIMMERS PRIMED FOR TITLE DEFENSE 
</P>

<P>
Pete Accardy gambles on stocks and race horses. But when it comes to his job, 
the Cal State Northridge swim coach covers his bets as often as possible. 
</P>
<P>
That is especially true when the stakes are as high as they are at the NCAA 
Division II swimming and diving national championships, which begin today and 
run through Saturday at State University of New York at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-member Northridge women's team is bidding for its third consecutive 
title and Accardy would appear to be playing with a stacked deck. 
</P>
<P>
"We have somebody we feel can make the finals in every race," Accardy said. 
"They're all swimming as well as ever." 
</P>
<P>
But Northridge will be hard-pressed to match its dominating performance of a 
year ago when it outscored second-place Tampa, 441-285, to win its third 
national championship since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been saying that this is the best women's team ever assembled," 
Accardy said after last year's meet. "I'd have to agree with them." 
</P>
<P>
However, that distinction may be passed to this year's squad. 
</P>
<P>
Last season's team broke six NCAA records and 15 school standards; those totals 
could be approached again. And of the six CSUN swimmers who set records in last 
year's meet, backstroke specialist Chris Breedy is the only one not competing 
here this week. 
</P>
<P>
Tina Schnare, a senior in the breaststroke, has a perfect record at national 
meets. Schnare has won titles in both the 100- and 200-yard events each of the 
past three years. Accardy is predicting that she will conclude her Northridge 
career the way she started it -- by breaking Division II records in both 
events. 
</P>
<P>
"She has trained harder than she has since her freshman year," Accardy said of 
Schnare. "She's primed." 
</P>
<P>
Along with Schnare, other Northridge swimmers expected to challenge for titles 
are Toady Kimble and Jude Kylander (freestyle sprints), Carol Eisele and Lisa 
Dial (medley), Jeanna Giessinger (middle-distance freestyle) and Michele Sulak 
(freestyle and butterfly). 
</P>
<P>
The Northridge men's team has set a less optimistic goal for the week. The 
Matadors, who won nine national championships from 1975-85, will try to avoid 
dropping out of the top 10 for the first time in Accardy's 19 seasons as coach. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Bakersfield is expected to win its fourth consecutive men's team 
championship. The CSUN men had visions of a national championship of their own 
until nine team members were declared academically ineligible at midseason. 
</P>
<P>
Among Northridge's six qualifiers is Ted Hollahan, defending champion and 
Division II record-holder in the 100- and 200-yard freestyles. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN's Rick Giambastini, a transfer from University of the Pacific, is among 
the favorites in the 200-yard butterfly.

7-RUN RALLY LIFTS RIO MESA OVER ALEMANY

Sophomore Dmitri Young had three hits and five runs batted in and Rio Mesa High 
pushed across seven runs in the decisive sixth inning as the Spartans defeated 
Alemany, 13-8, in a Westside tournament game Tuesday at Rio Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 8-6, in the bottom of the sixth, the Spartans launched their assault 
when Young scored Carlos Cendejas from third with a single. 
</P>
<P>
A sacrifice fly by Steve Soliz tied the score, 8-8, and the Spartans took their 
first lead when Alemany's Jeff Daniels threw a wild pitch that allowed Young to 
score from third. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa (2-1) got to Daniels for one more run, then touched up reliever Matt 
Delavinge for three more when Cendejas, batting for the second time in the 
inning, ripped a bases-loaded double down the left-field line. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany (2-1) led, 6-0, entering the bottom of the first, but Young, the state 
freshman player of the year last season, belted a two-run home run. Young 
employed his power again in the fourth, drawing Rio Mesa to within 8-6 with a 
two-run homer to left-center field. DAVID SALKIN

BRODOWY, HART BATTLE BACK TO TOP FONTANA IN GIRLS' PLAYOFFS

Sara Wilson and Nikki Brodowy scored back-to-back baskets to break a 49-49 
fourth-quarter tie and spark Hart High to a 68-57 win over Fontana in the first 
round of the Division I state girls' playoffs before a packed gym at Hart High 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians, who had trailed by 15 points in the first quarter, used Wilson's 
spinning jump shot with 7:15 to play to key a 10-0 run that put the Steelers 
away for good. 
</P>
<P>
Hart outscored the visitors, 19-8 down the stretch. Fontana (27-3), the 
runner-up in the Southern Section 5-AA Division, was held to 12 points in the 
fourth quarter on five-of-14 shooting from the field. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians' comeback began a quarter earlier as Brodowy -- who finished with a 
team-high 18 points -- scored 10 in the third quarter to help pull Hart back 
into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Brodowy opened the second half by hitting a 15-foot jump shot, a 12-foot shot 
from the baseline and a layup to cut Fontana's lead to 39-36. But she wasn't 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
About two minutes later she dipped under a defender and made an eight-foot bank 
shot to trim the deficit to one point, 45-44. 
</P>
<P>
With 1:51 to play in the third quarter, Wilson took a pass from Kim Posey and 
scored underneath to give Hart its first lead, 47-45. Hart led, 49-45, at the 
end of the period. 
</P>
<P>
Hart Coach Pam Walker said that the home crowd played a key role in the 
Indians' comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd is the best thing about playing in a town like this," Walker said. 
"We've been the only game in town for the last couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
However, the fans didn't play much of a role early on. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana center Danielle Carter, who averages a Southern Section-high 30 points 
a game, stunned the crowd by scoring 15 points in the first quarter as the 
Steelers built a 15 point lead and finished the quarter holding a 25-12 
advantage. But as the Hart defense began to heat up, Carter cooled and scored 
just eight points in the final three quarters to finish with 23. 
</P>
<P>
Hart caught fire at the beginning of the second quarter. Freshman Anjanette 
Dionne ignited the comeback with back-to-back three-point bombs that trimmed 
the deficit to 26-20. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me to slow it down and be patient," said Dionne, who finished with 
13 points. "And if I was open I could hit it." 
</P>
<P>
The teams traded baskets the remainder of the quarter and Fontana took a 36-30 
lead into halftime.

BOUNCES ARE TORREY PINES' IN VICTORY OVER ARTESIA

A handful of seconds remained in the third quarter, and guard Kyle Armstrong 
took his stance to try to increase host Torrey Pines' lead over Artesia in the 
first round of the Division II Southern California boys' basketball playoffs 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
He shot. Klank. 
</P>
<P>
Artesia's Deandre Austin grabbed the rebound. Armstrong raced at Austin, 
knocked the ball away and into the hands of Torrey Pines' center Kevin 
Flanagan. Flanagan shot. 
</P>
<P>
Bounce. Bounce. Boom. Two points. And the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
The ball, everything and everybody did Torrey Pines a good turn in its 62-51 
victory. The Falcons (32-1) -- who will play host to Dominguez, a 78-37 winner 
over Porterville Monache Tuesday, in Thursday's semifinals -- had few worries 
from the start. Artesia (21-7) had many. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that was just an example of team unity," said Flanagan of his 
last-second basket in the third quarter. "I think it's kind of unfortunate they 
rely on two really good athletes. Our whole team was fighting. Our whole team 
was scrapping." 
</P>
<P>
While Torrey Pines scrapped, Artesia's Ed O'Bannon hacked. Or so said the 
referees. Artesia Coach Wayne Merino wasn't sure O'Bannon, a junior who was a 
preseason Parade All-American, should have had to skip gingerly around the 
court through most of the second half. O'Bannon picked up his fourth foul with 
4:42 remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It threw our whole rhythm off," Merino said. "It really wasn't fair, but 
that's the way it goes. Anytime you're going out of your area, you've got to 
deal with that." 
</P>
<P>
That and Darren Cox. Cox, Torrey Pines' transfer point guard from Las Vegas, 
refused to miss in the first half. He took the pressure off Flanagan and 
forward Courtie Miller, who were packed in early by a sagging Artesia defense. 
</P>
<P>
Cox popped in 10 points in the first quarter and had 16 by halftime, four on 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
"Darren was just unconscious," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every night it's somebody different," Torrey Pines Coach John Farrell said. 
"This is a great group." 
</P>
<P>
Cox couldn't pinpoint why he was so hot. He had his usual pregame meal of stew. 
He didn't do anything different in warmups. He just felt good. No pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were all relaxed from the start," said Cox, who finished with a 
team-high 22 points. "The first half they were falling off so (the outside 
shot) was open." 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines was down by as much as six early. Cox tied the score with a 
three-pointer with 2:49 remaining in the first quarter and seconds later gave 
the Falcons the lead with a perfect jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
O'Bannon, who finished with a game-high 23 points, stirred the sellout crowd 
with a reverse dunk in the second quarter to tie the game at 26. Then Torrey 
Pines regained the lead and was never again headed. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons led 39-28 at halftime and 53-40 at the conclusion of the third 
quarter. Artesia crawled back slightly in the fourth quarter but was unable to 
come closer than eight.

The Lincoln Hornets, who play in a gymnasium called The Hive and win games 
because their pressing defense never stops buzzing around the basketball, lost 
their sting for just a moment Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was the beginning of the third quarter of Lincoln's Southern California 
Regional Division III first-round boys' basketball game against Inglewood 
Morningside. In just 1 minute 23 seconds, Lincoln's one-point halftime lead 
turned into a seven-point deficit, and for the No. 1-seeded Hornets, things 
eventually got stickier. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside, seeded No. 7, went on to post an 81-67 upset at Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, Lincoln Coach Ron Loneski spent a few moments talking about the 
lost moment -- the one that saw Lincoln sleepwalk out of the dressing room and 
get undressed by an 8-0 Morningside run that would never be overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"I take full responsibility," Loneski said. "It's a coach's job to get his team 
ready to play. But when we came out for the second half, we weren't ready. I 
may never know why, but I know that this won't stop bothering me for a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
For almost a year now, Lincoln (27-2) had been dreaming of a possible return to 
Oakland, where it lost the State Division III championship game last March. 
Morningside (24-5) put an end to those ideas quickly, however, after trailing, 
33-32, at the intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Sanders, a quick point guard who struggled against Lincoln's vaunted 
press in the first half, sliced through Lincoln's complex coverages to start 
the third quarter and twice found center Jeff Crowe for easy layups. 
</P>
<P>
Then Ken Jones, another slicing guard, stole a pass at half court and raced in 
for a layin to make it, 38-33. The short but telling run ended when Crowe, who 
led Morningside with 17 points, rebounded his own missed shot and scored for a 
40-33 Morningside advantage with 6:37 left. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Temple, who shot over Morningside's trapping zone defenses most of the 
night and finished with a game-high 32 points, kept Lincoln in the hunt after 
that, but a Lincoln run really never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we figured out their press, we were off and running," said Jones, who 
like his team, started slowly but came back to score all of his 14 points in 
the second half. "They gave us some trouble for a while, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
But Morningside dealt with the trouble. Especially after Temple threw down a 
slam and sent the crowd into a frenzy by giving Lincoln an early 5-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to have trouble with out press tonight," Loneski said aloud. 
</P>
<P>
Not in the second half, they didn't. Lincoln's defense wasn't moving as 
quickly, and Morningside, which was deep enough to have nine players score, 
didn't wear down. 
</P>
<P>
The Morningside lead grew to 53-40 late in the third quarter and 69-52 midway 
through the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, no sting would have been strong enough.

Orange Lutheran Coach Jerry Simmons proved Tuesday that information is indeed 
one of today's most valuable commodities. 
</P>
<P>
After skimming through the local newspaper that covers Christian High School, 
Simmons made a couple of adjustments that paid off in a 72-64 victory over 
Christian in the Division IV boys' quarterfinals of the Southern Regionals at 
Granite Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
"According to the local paper," Simmons said, "they were going to stop (Daryl) 
Cole. So we just opened up someone else. 
</P>
<P>
That someone else turned out to be junior forward Kent Dowding, a nine 
points-per-game scorer. Dowding far eclipsed his average, continually getting 
open on the baseline to score 27. 
</P>
<P>
"They left him open, and he can hit," Simmons said. "So he did hit." 
</P>
<P>
Dowding's explosion was one key to the victory. Another, perhaps more 
important, one was the fact that Christian's David Jeremiah, who holds two San 
Diego Section three-point records, was held to two points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"Some nights you just don't shoot well," Christian Coach Randy Wright said of 
Jeremiah. 
</P>
<P>
But Jeremiah was not the only Patriot having trouble scoring in the first two 
quarters. The Patriots missed their first four free throws and also missed the 
front ends of three one-and-one situations. 
</P>
<P>
"Missing those front-ends might not seem like much early in the ball game, but 
they add up," Wright said. "When it gets down to a four-point game later on, 
they look real big." 
</P>
<P>
While the Patriots were missing free throws and turning the ball over 13 times 
in the first half, the Lancers were building a 13-point halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
But in the second half, Christian stormed back to make a game of it, pulling to 
within four four times late in the game. In fact, the Patriots were knocking at 
the door with just 33 seconds left when center Darrell White sunk a four-footer 
to make it 66-62. 
</P>
<P>
"I was extremely proud of them the way they came back in the second half," 
Wright said. "They gave it all they had; they don't have anything left." 
</P>
<P>
White and Jeremiah, who found a groove in the second half to score 17 points, 
led Christian with 19 each.

Gulf &amp; Western Inc.: The New York-based conglomerate said net earnings for 
the first quarter increased 7% to $69 million. Revenue rose 14% to $1.4 
billion. The company said results were paced by a record performance from its 
consumer-commercial finance unit and significant contributions from Paramount 
movies such as "The Naked Gun" and "Scrooged" and television operations. These 
results more than offset normal seasonal losses from publishing-information 
operations, the company said.

Mycogen has signed a three-year, $7.7-million research and development contract 
with JT Biotech USA, a U.S. subsidiary of Japan Tobacco, to develop 
biopesticides for control of insects and weeds, the companies said Tuesday. In 
a related development, a second U.S. subsidiary of Japan Tobacco has agreed to 
pay $1.8-million, or $98 per share, for 200,000 shares of Mycogen stock. 
Mycogen's stock has traded at about $6 in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The research and development contract was the second that Mycogen has signed 
with a Japanese company. In 1987, Mycogen signed a three-year, $6-million 
research and development agreement with Kubota, a Japanese conglomerate, to 
develop agricultural biopesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Mycogen, a San Diego-based biotechnology company, and JT Biotech, will research 
new bioherbicides at Mycogen's laboratories in San Diego and Ruston, La., as 
well as a Japan Tobacco laboratory in Yokohama. 
</P>
<P>
According to terms of the agreement, Mycogen will retain U.S. market rights to 
newly developed products, but will pay a portion of profits to Japan Tobacco. 
The Japanese company will market new products in Japan under a license 
agreement and turn a portion of the profits over to Mycogen. 
</P>
<P>
Japan Tobacco entered the contract because "there is a need worldwide for new 
environmentally acceptable herbicide products," according to a prepared 
statement by Japan Tobacco Vice President Morio Tansho. 
</P>
<P>
Mycogen uses genetic engineering technology to form naturally occurring 
microorganisms that can eradicate weeds and insects. Japan Tobacco is that 
country's largest tobacco products manufacturer. It is also Japan's sole 
supplier of salt. GREG JOHNSON

CLOTHESTIME PLANS TO CLOSE 10 STORES, REACH OLDER BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clothestime, the struggling Anaheim-based discount chain that expanded rapidly 
by catering to the tastes and budgets of young women, plans to close 10 stores 
this year and revamp its image to reach an older, more affluent market. 
</P>
<P>
The change in strategy comes amid a $2.2-million loss for the year ended Jan. 
28. The loss, reported this week, included about $1 million set aside in the 
fourth quarter to pay for store closings. 
</P>
<P>
The chain of 333 clothing stores said it has changed its merchandising and 
advertising strategy at its approximately 100 Southern California stores to 
emphasize better quality clothing for an older, career-oriented customer. 
Stores nationwide will be converted to an upscale look with advertising to 
match by later this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not abandoning a market, we're expanding," John Shanklin, Clothestime's 
chief financial officer, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Clothestime, which has been in business since 1974, courted a 12- to 
29-year-old market by selling discount, brand-name junior fashions out of 
relatively low-rent strip mall locations. By fiscal 1986, that strategy had 
yielded earnings of $11.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the company's fortunes have suffered from a general slump in the 
retail clothing industry and the fickle tastes of their young buyers. Also, the 
size of that youth market has shrunk dramatically as the average age of 
American women has climbed. 
</P>
<P>
To remain profitable, the firm has little choice but to follow an aging market, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"That market made them successful. But it outgrew the stores," said Thomas 
Tashjian, an analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said some of the company's losses could have been avoided had the firm 
better anticipated the changing market. 
</P>
<P>
"Clothestime expanded too rapidly and didn't pay enough attention to its 
competition," said Jack Seibald, a retailing analyst at Salomon Bros., a 
brokerage firm in New York. "It happens easily when things are going so well." 
</P>
<P>
Seibald said Clothestime's difficulty may have also come from its attempts to 
expand outside the markets it knows best -- the West Coast and Southwest. 
Toward the end of its rapid expansion, the chain added stores in Wisconsin, 
Michigan and Virginia, where the more pronounced seasonal changes require 
different merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts agree the chances are good that Clothestime can win back those women 
that abandoned the store as they grew older. 
</P>
<P>
"But it may take some time for them to find their customers again," said Sarah 
Stack, an analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, a Los Angeles brokerage 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Seibald said that if the company's plans work, Clothestime could earn $3.5 
million this year. If it doesn't work, "then they've got troubles," he said.

ERNST &amp; WHINNEY ACCOUNTING FIRM SEEKS CLIENTS AMONG CALIFORNIA BANKS

Ernst &amp; Whinney, one of the nation's Big 8 accounting firms, is casting for 
clients among West Coast banks. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the firm's partners were hobnobbing with California bankers at the 
Independent Bankers Assn. of America national convention in Anaheim last week. 
The firm bought dinner for the California delegation at the pricey White House 
Restaurant in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking to expand our banking practice in California," said Jerry A. 
Felts, an accounting partner who recently moved to Los Angeles from Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Ernst &amp; Whinney has only two banking clients in California, but they're two 
of the biggest -- Bank of America and First Interstate Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Felts, who is in charge of the First Interstate account, said a number of 
partners and associates with experience in auditing banks and savings and loans 
have moved into Ernst &amp; Whinney offices in Northern and Southern California 
in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're coming out of the audit season and moving into the marketing 
season, a time when people start thinking of changing accounting firms," he 
said. "For the first time, we're going to put on a full-court press to see if 
we can unearth some prospects." 
</P>
<P>
The firm's marketing plan isn't complete yet, he said, but community banks and 
healthy S&amp;Ls will be the primary targets. Ernst &amp; Whinney has about 50 
partners and associates working in Orange County, mainly on real estate 
accounts.

Angola will cut oil exports by 5% in the second quarter as part of an effort by 
OPEC and non-OPEC nations to stabilize prices, an official of the Angolan state 
oil company Sonangol said. 
</P>
<P>
"The cut would amount to about 20,000 barrels per day," said the official who 
is in the company's London office.

Several other non-OPEC countries have already announced similar cuts in a bid

DIRK SUTRO / ARCHITECTURE: NATIONAL CITY'S CIVIC CENTER PLAN FALLS SHORT OF 
BEING ALL IT COULD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is it that stands out about National City? The Mile of Cars? A few great 
period Victorians? Beyond these images, many of us who don't live there have 
only hazy -- and not always positive -- impressions. 
</P>
<P>
City officials hope to change this with a new civic center in the heart of 
town, scheduled to break ground later this year. Designed by San Diego 
architects Wheeler Wimer Blackman &amp; Associates, the government complex is 
expected to spur a new era of economic vitality and set a high architectural 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
The positive economic impact seems probable, but, as design goes, the project 
falls several notches below what it could have been, looking too much like a 
speculative office building and not enough like a prestigious, people-oriented 
new soul of a city. 
</P>
<P>
City officials invited about a dozen local firms to bid on the job -- not with 
designs, but prices -- and Wheeler Wimer Blackman was selected simply because 
its proposed fee of 4.85% of the construction cost was less than half the next 
lowest bid, according to Arnold Peterson, the city's community development 
director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lacks Aggressive Pursuit 
</P>
<P>
Such a process seems exactly opposite of the best way to get a good design, 
which is to choose the architect with the best ideas, then make a financial 
agreement. National City's approach lacks the aggressive pursuit of fresh 
designs displayed recently by the cities of Escondido and Oceanside. Both held 
well-publicized civic center design competitions entered by local and national 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the criticism from some local architects that such contests are useful 
mostly for generating publicity, both resulted in top-notch designs. And, 
despite local griping that locals get overlooked when the field is open to 
national stars, that didn't prove true. A local firm (PAPA) did Escondido's new 
City Hall, and the nationally known Charles Moore &amp; Urban Innovations Group 
got the civic center job in Oceanside. And, in Escondido, the public was 
invited to comment on designs before the architect was selected. In National 
City, comments have been heard only since selection. 
</P>
<P>
The project could have taken a number of directions, since there was no strong 
historic or neighborhood context. Nearby are used-car lots, auto body shops and 
other uses in older buildings of little architectural impact. The site is a 
sloping pie slice of land immediately south of the existing '60s civic center 
with its entrance on National City Boulevard, at the edge of Kimball Park, a 
wonderful green open space with tremendous potential. 
</P>
<P>
The architects responded with a building of white precast concrete and green 
glass. A circular plaza joining the new structure to the old civic center is 
the best thing about the design. Aligned with Civic Center Drive, this outdoor 
space will offer a warm invitation to pedestrians and motorists. Made of 
concrete and stone, with plenty of benches and a piece of public art at its 
center, this promises to be a great people place. Also commendable is the way 
the architects tucked two levels of parking out of sight, below street level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Inspired Move 
</P>
<P>
Locating the council chamber at the back of this plaza, as a sort of link 
between the old and new buildings, is also an inspired move. Symbolically, it 
puts the seat of important decisions in full public view. Architecturally, the 
council chamber is a low, minimalist building with a free-standing 
aqueduct-like arch out front that gives a sense of importance to the complex. 
Adjacent conference rooms cantilevered over the park will have dramatic views. 
</P>
<P>
But, although the plaza sets up a main entry axis that leads into the council 
chamber, the main entrance to the big, new building, the place of prime 
importance to the public, is off to the side. This is a missed opportunity to 
guide users into the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does it lack a strong entry treatment, but also this main building 
will tower over everything else nearby, including the park, with its expanses 
of lawns, palm trees and children's play areas. At seven stories, it will rise 
to about 120 feet in a neighborhood of one- and two-story buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the city feels the size is needed as a flexing of economic muscle, 
as a catalyst for a new wave of intense development. As such, the civic center 
is too harsh a gesture toward the people who will have to look up at its green 
glass walls from the park side. 
</P>
<P>
There could have been some great interaction here. A public plaza at the edge 
of the building would have eased the transition between park and civic center. 
Instead, the design turns a cold green shoulder on the park -- there's only one 
narrow entrance from this side, and nothing that engages pedestrians. The 
building, at least in model form, looks more like a Holiday Inn from the park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeing Workers Inside 
</P>
<P>
The architects say the green glass will allow people outside to see workers 
inside, giving some sense of human interaction to the project. But those of us 
who have wandered through the Golden Triangle or downtown San Diego know that 
when strong daylight bounces off colored glass, it becomes nearly opaque. 
</P>
<P>
From the street side, the feeling will be friendlier, but, aside from the 
circular plaza, with its weak link to the main building, not inviting. In terms 
of massing, the architects had the right idea, stepping three elongated 
cylinders back from the street. From some angles, though, the composition is 
awkward, and a cynic might compare the whole thing to a stack of Dough Boy 
pools topped by a giant carrying handle. 
</P>
<P>
Vertical white fins on the outsides of these rounded volumes do a nice job of 
breaking up the expanses of glass; they also pick up the vertical details on 
the old civic center next door. The city requested a building that would look 
different from all angles, and Wheeler Wimer Blackman's design meets this 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Call it a pet peeve, but it's hard to imagine people working in San Diego 
County and not being able to get fresh air. Yet the new civic center will have 
operable windows only on the top floor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Natural Light 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the architects have organized the new building's offices around an 
interior atrium space. But it won't rise to the top of the building, so it 
won't let in natural light. Surely, there would have been a way to locate this 
dramatic five-story volume such that it could tap some bona fide daylight. 
</P>
<P>
Against the exciting new civic centers developing in Escondido and Oceanside, 
both fresh designs made with people in mind, National City's looks weak. That's 
not for lack of size (60,000 square feet) or budget ($10.6 million), but simply 
because the building doesn't maximize the opportunity for a people-oriented 
government center that opens itself to the beautiful park next door. Perhaps a 
formal competition process, one oriented toward good designs and not the bottom 
line, would have led to more adequate solutions, or spurred these architects on 
to new highs. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the architects, the city apparently didn't ask for outside design 
advice. The result makes a strong case for not putting city officials without 
design experience completely in charge of such a significant project.

JACK SMITH: IN SO MANY WORDS, HERE'S A BANNED LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lake Superior State College, at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., has come out with its 
annual list of words and phrases that its banishment committee recommends for 
banishment from the language. 
</P>
<P>
It banishes words for "mis-, mal-, or over-use," as well as for general 
uselessness. (By the way, misuse and overuse are in the dictionary, but I can't 
find maluse.) 
</P>
<P>
Leading the 1989 Dishonor List are catastrophic health insurance and forced 
relaxation. Nominated for redundancy were pizza pie, pre- planning and wise old 
adage. 
</P>
<P>
They argue that pizza is the name of that savory dish; that one need not 
"pre-plan" for one's funeral and burial, as the cemeteries urge, but merely 
plan; that wise old adage is doubly redundant, because adage means a wise old 
saying. So what wise old adage really means is wise, wise, old, old saying. 
</P>
<P>
I am not too troubled by wise old adage. I suspect that many wise old adages 
have just been coined by those who use them, and need to be identified as such. 
I make them up all the time. 
</P>
<P>
Kari Zipf of Walla Walla, Wash., nominated catastrophic health insurance, 
complaining that she has no need of insurance for catastrophic health. She 
doesn't really want catastrophic health. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Sullivan of Marquette, Mich., recommended banishment of the hideous 
oxymoron forced relaxation, which she described as a "modern behavior 
management technique" in which schoolchildren are forced to sit in a chair or 
lie on the floor for three minutes and 10 seconds without resisting. I wouldn't 
ban the phrase; I'd ban the practice. 
</P>
<P>
George Drury of Milwaukee urged banishment of gourmet as an adjective, as in 
"gourmet meal," "gourmet' chef" and so on. "What," he asked, "or whom, does 
'gourmet-flavor' cat food taste like?" 
</P>
<P>
Dave Frownfelder and Mike Clement, Adrian, Mich., radio personalities, 
recommended the banishment of baby boomers, which they called "a cheap catch 
phrase for people born during a population explosion not of their own making." 
</P>
<P>
I agree. I have used baby boomers several times, and always felt that it was a 
word that inflicted the sins of the parents on their offspring. Out with it. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also banished cul-de-sac as used by real estate developers. 
Obviously, developers use cul-de-sac because they think it has more class then 
the graphic dead end. 
</P>
<P>
Attacking a longer phrase, the committee banishes "Total capacity of this room 
limited to 100 persons," pointing out that it is doubly redundant. "Total, 
capacity and limit all have the same meaning." 
</P>
<P>
They argue also that this room is unnecessary, since the sign obviously applies 
to the room it is in. Also persons is superfluous, unless other kinds of 
animals are expected. All that needs to be said, they say, is "Capacity 100." 
Good thinking. But I doubt that the people who write signs can ever be held to 
such bare simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also interdicts cold glass of beer, observing "Who cares about 
the temperature of the glass?" 
</P>
<P>
Unnecessarily pedantic. I have heard hot cup of coffee vilified on the same 
ground -- that it is not the temperature of the cup that is important, but the 
temperature of the coffee. Nonsense. Hot cup of coffee is idiomatic, and so is 
cold glass of beer. Anyway, have you ever drunk hot coffee from a cold cup, or 
cold beer from a hot glass? 
</P>
<P>
As usual, sports jargon was roughly treated. Defense, when used as a verb, as 
in "Bubba O'Sullivan is a quarterback who is tough to defense," was banished. 
"The verb defend is recommended." Won't work. That would mean that the 
quarterback is hard for his backs and linemen to defend against the opposing 
players. It has to be defend against. Defense is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Much worse than this useful jargon, it seems to me, are the solecisms sports 
announcers commit when they are trying to avoid like, having been told by Ed 
Newman that "Winstons taste good, like a cigarette should" is bad English. 
</P>
<P>
I actually heard one of our better sportscasters, obviously trying to avoid 
like (a perfectly good word), say "It looks as if a first down," and later, 
evidently sensing that that wasn't quite right, "It looks to be a first down." 
</P>
<P>
What he meant, of course, was "It looks like a first down."

ALICE KAHN: PUTTING OUT A CONTRACT ON THE 20TH CENTURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some mornings you wake up convinced that a huge ironyectomy has been performed 
on the world. A guy writes a satire. In some people's eyes, an ugly satire 
calculated to enrage. Eddie Murphy meets Lucifer. In the wake of a book come 
death threats, real deaths, bombings. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who've spent too long in the mealy-mouthed 20th Century, with its 
namby-pamby democracy and its nicey-nicey God and its humorless feminist 
hissers, can't understand this "Death to the satirist pigs" stuff. It seems to 
us a bit out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
We don't get this whole notion of contracts on an author's life. Six-million 
bucks if you're in the faith; $1 million for an infidel hit man. Will there be 
a run on the Koran in Mafia neighborhoods? 
</P>
<P>
And finally, we are reduced to our little protests. The greatest authors, 15 of 
them, are introduced on "Donahue" like players on a football team. They stand 
up and talk about the threats they've faced in the name of literature. Bereft 
of irony, they end up arguing on daytime television with an American Muslim 
teen-ager from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Need I say that I, too, am playing my part by watching the show? 
</P>
<P>
Addressing Norman Mailer, Kurt Vonnegut, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. et al., the 
teen-age girl -- earnest, wide-eyed and ponytailed -- says, "You really, really 
don't understand how bad we feel." 
</P>
<P>
Her look, her accent, her words are Mall Girl. Her heart is in ancient Araby. 
She is close to tears. 
</P>
<P>
Without hesitation, the great authors challenge her. She is the spokesperson 
for "the other side" in this satire on democracy. Norman Mailer never backs 
down. Erica Jong lets her have it. 
</P>
<P>
A caller calls in. Go ahead, caller: "I just want to say that in this era of 
trash TV, I'm really proud you had these people on, Phil." 
</P>
<P>
But what to do? Carry a sign outside a bookstore? Wear a button? Actually read 
the book? 
</P>
<P>
Write a letter to the Ayatollah protesting his decision to order a hit? "Dear 
Mr. Khomeini, as an American citizen I object to your order. The amount seems 
excessive, and I don't think it's fair to offer a different amount to 
nonbelievers. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Call the Russians greedy opportunists for playing "Let's Make a Deal" with Iran 
in the middle of this? Wear a "Nuke 'em If They Can't Take a Joke" T-shirt? 
Denounce George Bush? 
</P>
<P>
These things have been done, and soon it will be forgotten by all but a few who 
will carry on the protest and the vendetta. And especially by those whose lives 
are on the line. 
</P>
<P>
One day I opened the newspaper and read that the salmon season had opened. It 
happened to be the same day the Salman season opened. The salmon season will 
close, but Rushdie will never be safe again. 
</P>
<P>
Most of us will go on to the next story. We will read about the woman who has 
been arrested twice for impersonating David Letterman's wife. We will read that 
she was found in his home "eating canned pineapple." 
</P>
<P>
Canned pineapple, there's the rub. There's the zany Letterman touch come back 
to haunt him. 
</P>
<P>
Why make jokes? The world's too scary. The world's too crazy. The world has 
gone mad today and good's bad today. 
</P>
<P>
But like a lone nut with a pun, I will carry on. I am part of that small band 
of cognitive dissidents who won't quit, especially when we pick up the paper 
and read that 57% of Americans surveyed said they "could not live without a 
microwave oven." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the unmicrowaved life is not worth living. 
</P>
<P>
Death from Khomeini or death from microwave deprivation? Tomorrow at 4 on 
"Donahue."

'LADY DAY' MISSES SOUND, STYLE OF HOLIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since her death 30 years ago, attempts have been made to re-create 
dramatically the mystique of Billie Holiday. Tributes and concerts, a movie and 
TV documentaries have been largely unsuccessful; the sole exception was a 
90-minute British-made television special, which succeeded because Lady Day 
herself was seen at length in rare film or tape clips and was heard talking in 
voice-overs. 
</P>
<P>
"Lady Day," at the Odyssey Theater, ranks close to the bottom among these 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
In certain respects it recalls the somewhat more convincing "Lady Day at 
Emerson's Bar &amp; Grill," a dramatization seen by this reviewer in Montreal 
with Ranee Lee in the title role, and later in Hollywood with S. Epatha 
Merkerson. Both Lee and Merkerson were reasonably successful in capturing some 
of the essence of Holiday's persona; neither of them tried to imitate her 
once-in-a-lifetime timbre and in-person charisma. 
</P>
<P>
Rena Scott, in her Lady Day impression at the Odyssey, labors under a series of 
handicaps. She just is not the actress for the part, which will be apparent to 
anyone who has seen Holiday, even on TV. She talks too fast, sometimes too 
flippantly, and switches moods too abruptly. 
</P>
<P>
To aggravate matters, she is backed by a quartet of unyielding mediocrity, with 
a pianist who seems unfamiliar with some of the songs that Holiday made famous. 
</P>
<P>
With a few exceptions, Scott does not come across vocally as the right artist 
to capture the dark, forlorn woman behind Lady Day's glamorous mask, nor does 
she even bring to the brighter numbers, such as "What a Little Moonlight Can 
Do," the fey quality that enabled Holiday to turn sow's-ear songs into silk 
melodic purses. Visually she is too busy; part of the Holiday magic was her 
genius for putting a song across with a minimum of movements. 
</P>
<P>
The format of the presentation, set in a diminutive space with virtually no set 
except for a bandstand, uses only one other character, a stage manager. The 
scene is London in 1954, at the end of Holiday's first and only European tour. 
</P>
<P>
This writer, who happened to be the organizer and emcee of that tour, never saw 
Billie Holiday almost falling-down drunk, though that is how she is depicted in 
the second act. This insult to her memory is only one of numerous inaccuracies 
and anachronisms. 
</P>
<P>
The songs are interspersed with narration by Scott, some in the form of 
flashbacks to her traumatized childhood and adolescence. The script, though 
generally written with conviction, glosses over so many details that the 
listener may not even catch the glancing references to such episodes as her 
tour with the all-white Artie Shaw orchestra. The name of her first husband is 
mumbled just once; the later man in her life, Louis McKay, who in fact went to 
London with her, is written out and placed in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's voice is at times strong and affecting, if one tries to overlook her 
apparent indecision about whether to simulate the style of her role model. 
"Strange Fruit," the most demanding song of all with its gruesome story of a 
lynching, makes a moving finale for the first act. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody who has studied Holiday's records is likely to accept the use of scat 
singing, in which Scott indulges two or three times, apparently unaware that 
Lady Day never resorted to that technique. 
</P>
<P>
The absolute nadir is reached three songs from the end, when Scott sings "I 
Can't Get Started" in a sort of Ethel Merman upbeat frenzy, with the pianist, 
Darryl Archibald, plunking out unsophisticated chord changes. 
</P>
<P>
At the show Saturday evening, David Patterson played saxophone, substituting 
for Louis Taylor. Completing the group were Carter Armstrong on bass and Keith 
Swan on drums. They, like Scott, are less to blame than whoever cast them in 
roles for which they seem strangely unsuited. 
</P>
<P>
The larger issue raised by "Lady Day" is that of what seems to be an endless 
attempt to take advantage of Holiday's posthumous stature as a cult figure. The 
disastrously distorted story line of the 1972 movie "Lady Sings the Blues" was 
the egregious case in point. To Diana Ross' credit, though, she came closer 
than any of her successors to the sound and persona of the woman she portrayed. 
</P>
<P>
Written and directed by Stephen Stahl, "Lady Day" can be credited with good 
intentions on his part and on that of the ill-starred Scott. But now is the 
time to lay aside the tributes and dramatizations, buy all available Billie 
Holiday records, and let the great lady rest in peace.

Painting pinups on airplane nose cones is back in vogue at Castle Air Force 
Base in California where a KC-135 Stratotanker sports a 1940s-era calendar 
pinup in a midriff blouse and miniskirt rippling in the breeze. Castle Air 
Force Base officials said the painting is designed to instill pride in the 
crews that fly and maintain Strategic Air Command aircraft. A sketch of a 
knight with a sword and shield mounted on a horse has already been approved for 
decorating the nose of another Stratotanker. Plane art originated during World 
War I when aircraft first assumed a major role in warfare, and reached its 
zenith during World War II. ALEENE MacMINN

A living room set that was owned by composer Ludwig Von Beethoven until his 
death in 1827 and was part of his estate brought about $8,333 at an auction 
Tuesday in Paris. The five-piece ensemble was purchased by an unidentified 
American. The set consisted of a love seat with a curved back and arms in solid 
walnut, three fan-backed chairs covered in green felt and a small laminated 
table. ALEENE MacMINN

Spanish singer Julio Iglesias has been named a special representative of the 
United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and has agreed 
to give 30 concerts over five years for the benefit of the organization. The 
initial concerts are planned for Paris and Madrid in November, followed by a 
third in Moscow before the end of this year. ALEENE MacMINN

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD: MILSAP TO BRING NONSTOP HIT 
PARADE TO BACCHANAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ronnie Milsap, appearing Friday night at the Bacchanal nightclub in Kearny 
Mesa, is to country music what Stevie Wonder is to pop. They're both prodigious 
hit-makers, they're both considered legends in their respective genres and 
they're both blind. 
</P>
<P>
Tracing back each artist's career, one may or may not be surprised to find 
these parallels springing from the same point. Like Wonder, Milsap got his 
start as a professional musician in the middle 1960s, cutting rhythm-and-blues 
records and playing scattered dates -- mostly in the South, mostly before black 
audiences -- with veteran R&amp;B heavyweights the Miracles. 
</P>
<P>
In time, however, Milsap drifted back to his country roots -- he was, after 
all, born and raised in North Carolina, home of such celebrated country 
pioneers as Earl Scruggs and the "Hillbilly Waltz King," Clyde Moody -- and, in 
1972, he moved to Nashville. There, he hooked up with Charlie Pride's manager, 
Jack Johnson, who helped him get a record deal with RCA Records. 
</P>
<P>
Milsap's first single, "I Hate You," was a Top 10 hit on the national country 
charts. Since then, virtually everything he's recorded has turned to gold. 
Milsap's country-chart hits, according to the Harmony Illustrated Encyclopedia 
of Country Music, "are too numerous to list in full." 
</P>
<P>
Not only that, but, over the last decade, a half dozen of his singles have 
crossed over onto the Top 40 pop charts, including "(There's) No Gettin' Over 
Me" and "Any Day Now." 
</P>
<P>
One small aside: In January, 1981, Milsap scored his second Top 40 smash with 
"Smoky Mountain Rain." That same month, Wonder scored his 36th with "I Ain't 
Gonna Stand for It." 
</P>
<P>
The best way to get over the death of a pet is to get a new one. And as far as 
San Diego promoter Bill Silva is concerned, the same applies to the loss of a 
perennially popular outdoor concert facility. 
</P>
<P>
A month after he was formally shut out of San Diego State University's 
4,800-seat Open Air Theater, which since 1977 has been the site of a 
tremendously successful annual concert series, Silva has announced plans to 
produce a competing series at the 4,300-seat Starlight Bowl in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 18 big-name pop, rock, jazz and reggae acts are on tap for this 
year's inaugural Concerts in the Park series, Silva said. Saturday's appearance 
by Cheap Trick was something of a preseason exhibition game; the actual series 
will begin in April and continue through the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Silva readily admits that he's hoping to outbid, and out-book, Avalon 
Attractions of Los Angeles, which has produced the Open Air Theater's annual 
concert series since 1984. In January, Avalon's exclusive was extended for up 
to 20 years, despite a vigorous challenge by Silva and an out-of-town promoter. 
</P>
<P>
"We're vying for a lot of the same acts that they're hoping to get," Silva 
said. Among them, he added, are pop singers Al Jarreau and George Benson, jazz 
saxophonist Kenny G, and "various rock and reggae bands. . . . I don't want to 
name until the contracts are signed." 
</P>
<P>
"If the competition knows I'm interested in a certain act, they may go after 
that same act, either because they want the show themselves or simply to get 
the bidding up," Silva said. "In any case, I'm not willing to pay the extra 10 
grand." 
</P>
<P>
The Starlight Bowl was built more than 50 years ago by the Ford Motor Co. to 
show off new car models during the California-Pacific International Exhibition 
of 1935, which was held in Balboa Park. Since then, the amphitheater has hosted 
everything from union meetings to San Diego Civic Light Opera musicals; the 
only caveat was no amplified music because of the proximity of the Naval 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
With the recent relocation of the hospital a mile or so away, the noise 
restrictions no longer apply. Last fall, Silva introduced rock 'n' roll to the 
Starlight Bowl with concerts by the late Roy Orbison and Steel Pulse. 
</P>
<P>
"And we got such a great response -- both from the artists, who loved the 
setting, and from the fans, who loved the central location, the easy freeway 
access, the sight lines, and the comfortable seats -- that we decided to put 
together a full-blown concert series for 1989," Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: San Diego's The Jacks have a new look and a new sound. Ken Layne, 
formerly with local roots rockers the Outriders, has signed on as singer, 
songwriter and rhythm guitarist; Brian (Custard Pants) Clark replaces Giacomo 
(Jack) DiMatteo on drums. And, after three years of playing blue-eyed soul, 
said band leader Buddy Blue, the Jacks are headed toward a more rootsy, country 
sound. "I miss the kind of music I was doing with the Beat Farmers," Blue said, 
"and I think some of our fans do, too." A charter member of the Beat Farmers, 
Blue recorded two albums with the group before leaving in early 1986 to form 
the Jacks. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night's concert by hometown heavy-metal heroes Ratt, at the San Diego 
Sports Arena, has been canceled because of poor ticket sales. . . . .This 
year's eighth annual Concerts by the Bay series at Humphrey's on Shelter Island 
includes a rare concert appearance by rock 'n' roll legend Gene Pitney (June 
23). The melodramatic crooner, whose early-'60s hits include "Town Without 
Pity" and "Only Love Can Break a Heart," hasn't toured nationally in 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Diamond's April 17 concert at the Sports Arena sold out less than three 
hours after the box office opened last Monday. A second show has been added for 
April 18.

San Diego Opera announced that Carroll Freeman will replace ailing tenor Mark 
DuBois in the role of Ernesto in Donizetti's "Don Pasquale," which continues 
Friday and Sunday at Civic Theatre. Although this marks Freeman's San Diego 
Opera debut, he performed with the San Diego Symphony as soloist in three 
performances of Handel's "Messiah" in December. The young American tenor made 
his New York City Opera debut in Verdi's "La Traviata" and has sung frequently 
with Houston Grand Opera.

If you've got a strong arts background and the ability to withstand heat that 
would glaze a clay vase, San Diego has an opening today for a new public arts 
administrator. Joyce Selber, who's held the job since its creation in October, 
1986, announced her resignation Tuesday to assume the post of exectuive 
director of the Commission for the Arts in Pasadena. The San Diego public arts 
administrator's job, one that rests in the cross fire between the arts 
community and city government, pays $45,698 a year. Apply to the San Diego 
Commission for Arts and Culture.

Americans turned to television in droves last week for laughs. Ten of the 11 
most-watched programs on TV were comedies, the A.C. Nielsen Co. reported 
Tuesday, with NBC's Thursday-night duo of "The Cosby Show" and "A Different 
World" leading the way. Only CBS' serious-minded "60 Minutes" interrupted the 
flow of humor at the top of the ratings chart, placing sixth. NBC was laughing 
most among the networks as it placed first for the 37th week in a row. The full 
ratings list is on page 10. 
</P>
<P>
* Not so funny from CBS' standpoint was the debut performance of "Hard Time on 
Planet Earth." The new Wednesday-night series placed 65th among the week's 81 
prime-time programs.

BEEHIVE, PETROL INVADE SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's in a name? 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the two U.K.-U.S.A. crossbreed bands working their way through 
the Southland this week, quite a bit. 
</P>
<P>
Take the headliner's odd name, That Petrol Emotion: self-consciously obscure . 
. . knotty . . . flat and inert . . . ultimately nonsensical. 
</P>
<P>
Then consider the opener's odd name, Voice of the Beehive: obscure, maybe, but 
also resonant and alive . . . a little mystical, a little funny . . . 
ultimately meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way the music went Monday night at Bogart's, where the second-billed 
Voice of the Beehive generated a giddy atmosphere that hung like a happy haze 
until That Petrol Emotion came along and wiped it out with its constricted 
clamor. 
</P>
<P>
Sisters Tracy Bryn and Melissa Belland, who moved from Encino to England and 
formed the Beehive with three Englishmen, sported a motley, Melrose Avenue 
petticoats-and-stockings look and engineered a grimy, garage-band attack. With 
Bryn stomping around and chopping out the guitar chords and Belland swinging 
her huge single braid, the effect was a goofy melange of Cyndi Lauper, Bette 
Midler, Blondie, the Kinks and the Go-Go's. 
</P>
<P>
All the animation on the stage and the catchiness of the tunes tended to 
disguise the cynicism of Bryn's lyrics, which bear the bruises of bitter 
experience with men given to abusing both body and soul. That made the joy 
radiated by these Valley girls and company all the more precious. 
</P>
<P>
If ever a bill begged to be flip-flopped, this is it. The claustrophobic, 
oblique art-funk of That Petrol Emotion -- an Irish band with an American 
singer that's been laboring semi-underground for a few years and now has a 
dance-chart success with "Groove Check" -- is no way to end a night that began 
on such an up note. See for yourself tonight at UC Santa Barbara and Thursday 
at the Palace. RICHARD CROMELIN

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: FESTIVAL OFFERS 'NOTTURNO,' RESTORED 'SODOM, GOMORRHA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American premiere of Fritz Lehner's "Notturno" (1988) and the screening of 
the recently restored 1922 spectacle "Sodom und Gomorrha" are among the 
highlights of "The Contemporary Art Scene in Austria" festival, which the Max 
Kade Institute and the Austrian Consulate General is presenting with USC's 
schools of cinema and drama. 
</P>
<P>
"Notturno" screens Saturday at USC's Norris Theater at 8 p.m., and "Sodom und 
Gomorrha" will be shown by the Silent Society at the Hollywood Studio Museum 
tonight at 7:30 with piano accompaniment by Robert Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"Sodom und Gomorrha" is hardly contemporary but it's fun -- a must for silent 
film buffs. Directed by Michael Curtiz when his last name was still spelled 
Kertesz, this stupefying yet also stupendous picture makes De Mille epics of 
the period seem like models of taste and restraint. We think of Vienna as a 
citadel of European sophistication, but this production is pure kitsch with a 
capital K. The sets seem far bigger and more elaborate than those for 
"Intolerance" and even De Mille's silent "Ten Commandments," but they're all so 
gaudy they're awful and the acting isn't acting, for the most part, but 
extravagant posturing. 
</P>
<P>
Like many a De Mille production, a modern story and a biblical inspirational 
tale are intercut. The modern story involves a young woman, Mary Conway (Lucy 
Doraine), who becomes completely cynical when her mother marries her off to a 
banker, a vastly rich older man (Georg Reimers) whose mansion seems bigger than 
the Schoenbrunn Palace. 
</P>
<P>
After driving one man (Kurt Ehrle) nearly to suicide and drifting into an 
affair with her stepson (Walter Slezak, then a slim youth), Mary has two 
severely cautionary dreams-within-a dream. (This is none too clear on the 
screen.) First, there's her nightmare imagining the dire consequences of her 
behavior, which in turn gives way to her dream that she is the wife of Lot and 
the Queen of Syria. 
</P>
<P>
Yet "Sodom und Gomorrha" is worth seeing for more than camp or history. 
Cinematographer Gustav Ucicky's images are remarkable, and they grow more so as 
the barbaric nonsense and tepid orgies of the biblical sequences build toward a 
climax of epic destruction, a vision of chaos that takes you by surprise with 
its sheer power and duration. In retrospect it's amazing to realize that 20 
years later Curtiz directed two of Hollywood's most beloved movies, "Yankee 
Doodle Dandy" and "Casablanca." (For reservations for "Sodom und Gomorrha": 
(213) 937-0776.) 
</P>
<P>
Fritz Lehner's "Notturno" is an impassioned, very beautiful -- and sometimes 
quite free -- rendering of the life of Schubert, which turns on the generally 
accepted belief that the Viennese composer was a syphillitic. In its heady, 
gorgeous way, "Notturno" is an intense and engaging film in which the likable, 
unhandsome young Schubert (Udo Samuel) transforms his sexual longing into great 
music (which of course floods the sound track). For more festival information: 
(213) 743-8066, 444-9310. 
</P>
<P>
Aki Kaurismaki's "Hamlet Goes Into Business" (1987), which screens Saturday at 
7:30 p.m. in Melnitz Theater as part of the final program in the UCLA Film 
Archives' "The Brothers Kaurismaki" retrospective, is as successful and bold a 
contemporary reworking of Shakespeare as Aki's "Crime and Punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Aki's unprepossessing Hamlet (Pirkka-Pekka Petelius) is the bulky, middle-aged 
son of a Helsinki industrial paper and shipping tycoon who is poisoned by his 
brother Klaus (Esko Salminen), who would reduce a once-mighty family concern to 
turning out rubber ducks. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing noble about this lethal family and its deadly machinations, but 
its plight and its fate have considerable political implications both for life 
in Finland and that country's minor position in world trade. Shot in striking 
high contrast black-and-white like a classic film noir, "Hamlet Goes Into 
Business" is set largely in the family's vast, castle-like mansion, as isolated 
as Elsinore, and it has a darkly humorous, dryly outrageous tone.

TWO CONDUCTORS IN GREEN UMBRELLA SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Oliver Knussen may still be afflicted with the mystery malady that has kept him 
from honoring his commitments for more than three weeks -- he's "a bit 
overworked," his New York representative said -- but the program he concocted 
for the Green Umbrella series went on as scheduled. On relatively short notice, 
Robert Black and Rand Steiger replaced Knussen at the helm of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic New Music Group at the Japan America Theatre on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Steiger, the Philharmonic's assistant composer-in-residence, inherited Danish 
composer Poul Ruders' "Corpus cum Figuris," which he had conducted a month ago 
in San Diego. A big work in every sense, "Corpus" made a heavy, imposing 
climax. 
</P>
<P>
Built in three large, palpable sections, the piece begins in ominous brooding, 
with sinous string polyphony growing into an implacable march for the full, 
20-piece ensemble. It ends in a frenetic series of iterative, wind and 
percussion exclamation points. 
</P>
<P>
In between, alas, are arid stretches of abstract motivic manipulation, 
interlarded with quasi-Minimal asides. These passages stall, but do not derail, 
the progress of the piece, which ultimately generates massive power. 
</P>
<P>
The performance was taut and well balanced. "Corpus" makes considerable 
instrumental and ensemble demands -- the high, hard-hitting trumpet solos, 
forcefully played by Donald Green, for example -- and all were capably met. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the program fell to Black, music director of several symphonic and 
chamber ensembles in New York. He began with the local premiere of the ". . . 
entre pausas furiosas . . ." section of "Geometry and Delirium," an evolving 
work by Jay Alan Yim, a Los Angeles native now teaching at Northwestern 
University. 
</P>
<P>
The title comes from a prose poem by Octavio Paz, and the short piece does 
provide vivid, though not necessarily very involving, aural images. Despite the 
proliferation of microphones, however, it does not have the processed 
production sheen the composer describes. In fact, the amplification distorted 
balances without adding much body to the dissonant frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
Toru Takemitsu's "Tree Line," composed for the 20th anniversary of the London 
Sinfonietta last year, is a typically colorful, lovingly scored soundscape. It 
was given just the right amount of passionate understatement by Black and the 
ensemble, ending with a poignant off-stage oboe solo from Carolyn Hove. 
</P>
<P>
Takemitsu's Impressionistic 1982 "Rain Coming," in an equally fluent and 
absorbing account, completed the program.

'TO BE AN AMERICAN' IS NOT EASY FOR CAMBODIAN REFUGEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
'To Be an American," airing tonight at 10 on Channels 4, 36 and 39, puts a face 
on the often faceless stories of Southeast Asian refugees. The very human face 
in this case belongs to one Tong Chiv, who, at 17, has made remarkable strides 
dealing with the myriad problems of assimilation. 
</P>
<P>
At age 9, Tong left her family behind in Refugee Camp No. 2, a wretched way 
station for some 160,000 Cambodian refugees in Thailand, coming to the United 
States with an older sister and the sister's husband. "To Be an American" is 
the story of Tong's attempt to reunite with her family, to bring them to join 
her in America. 
</P>
<P>
Living with a foster family in Lowell, Mass., Tong, a resourceful, intelligent 
young woman, manages to get the assistance of her classmates, neighbors and 
Rep. Chet Atkins (D-Mass.), as well as financial aid from local agencies. She 
is successful -- the family is reunited in the "freedom country." 
</P>
<P>
But as producer-director Tom Spain makes clear in this NBC News special, the 
family's journey is just beginning. The new land has its own brand of problems: 
culture shock, racism, isolation for "outsiders." Interviews with whites who 
see the Cambodians as trouble -- they're OK, but let 'em live elsewhere -- and 
with a textile manufacturer who is thrilled with his docile work force are 
illuminating. 
</P>
<P>
"To Be an American" is subtle when it needs to be, letting the camera tell the 
tale in many scenes -- as when Tong explains a microwave oven to her mother, 
and when the family first encounters snow. It is very moving at times, 
particularly when the soft-spoken Tong recounts the horrors the family has seen 
and her love for her sister. 
</P>
<P>
The issues that "American" raises won't simply go away. The camps in Thailand 
are swollen with refugees and are growing every day. Many of these people will 
wind up in the United States, mostly in Southern California. How we -- a nation 
of immigrants -- treat this latest wave of newcomers will say a lot about 
whether this is truly a kinder and gentler era. MARTIN ZIMMERMAN

JUSTICES HEAR DEBATE ON PROP. 103, APPEAR DIVIDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of an apparently divided state Supreme Court sharply questioned a 
battery of attorneys Tuesday in an exhaustive and highly charged debate over 
the constitutionality of Proposition 103, the sweeping insurance reform 
initiative approved by voters last November. 
</P>
<P>
From the often-spirited questions by the justices, there appeared to be 
significant division within the court on the multitude of issues that have 
arisen in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The court's two most liberal members -- Justices Stanley Mosk and Allen E. 
Broussard -- closely interrogated the insurance industry's lawyer as he 
attacked the validity of the measure. But perhaps its most conservative member, 
Justice Marcus M. Kaufman, peppered the measure's defenders with a series of 
questions, expressing doubt that insurers could be required to provide policies 
at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
Other justices were less aggressive, but no less intent, in their own 
questioning of the lawyers in the case. But it was far from clear what the 
outcome will be when the court issues a decision. 
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute argument took place in the most far-reaching case to come before 
the newly aligned court since the departure of Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth 
Bird and two other court members, who were defeated in the fall, 1986, 
election. 
</P>
<P>
The decision will affect millions of Californians holding auto, casualty and 
property insurance. At stake is an estimated $4 billion in premium reductions 
under the measure, along with broad new governmental control over an industry 
that has been relatively unregulated in the past. The case has drawn nationwide 
attention, because similar regulatory proposals are being considered in 17 
other states. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has also focused new attention -- and potentially conflicting 
pressures -- on the seven justices. As a generally conservative court, it might 
be expected to side with business, in this instance the insurance industry. But 
the justices also might be inclined to defer to the will of the voters, another 
course often taken by conservative courts. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing took place in a jam-packed courtroom, filled to its 102-seat 
capacity with lawyers, legislators, officials and reporters. Proceedings were 
televised to an overflow audience outside, as well as the nearby Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earlier Ruling Possible 
</P>
<P>
The justices, under newly adopted internal procedures, are due to issue a 
ruling within 90 days. But with the case already under consideration by the 
court for four months, an earlier decision may be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer leading the attack on the measure said the initiative was laden with 
invalid provisions and must be struck down by the court in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>
"Proposition 103 was drafted in a hasty manner and in total disregard for the 
constitutions of both the state of California and the United States," said 
Frank Rothman, a Los Angeles attorney representing the insurance industry. "It 
should not have been submitted to the voters." 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of the measure countered that the dramatic rate rollbacks and other 
provisions were a lawful way of curtailing runaway insurance costs. If any 
portion is struck down, they said, the rest of the initiative should remain in 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cried Out for Reform' 
</P>
<P>
"The voters have clearly expressed their outrage over the insurance crisis," 
said state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, making a rare personal appearance 
before the court. "The voters found that the current system of 
non-accountability and non-regulation, of special legislative privileges and 
corporate collusion, cried out for reform." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph W. Cotchett, a Burlingame lawyer representing sponsors of the 
initiative, implored the justices to allow most of the measure to take effect, 
even if some parts were invalidated. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking expansively as though he were addressing a jury, Cotchett told the 
court: "If you find the rollback discriminatory, that can be 'severed out,' " 
he said. "You could still have a very good and workable insurance reform 
package enacted into law." 
</P>
<P>
Under the initiative, insurance rates would be reduced 20% below their 
November, 1987, levels and held in place until November, 1989, with exceptions 
allowed only when an insurer shows a "substantial threat of insolvency." After 
that period, any rate increases would be subject to approval of an elected 
state insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Details of Provisions 
</P>
<P>
Other provisions would sharply limit auto policy cancellations and 
non-renewals; base auto insurance rates more on drivers' records and less on 
where they live; allow banks to sell insurance; remove insurers' exemption from 
state antitrust laws, and establish a nonprofit, independent corporation to 
advocate consumer interests. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies filed suit challenging the initiative the day after the 
Nov. 8 election, charging that it was unconstitutional on several grounds. In 
December, the justices agreed to hear the insurers' challenge, but allowed the 
measure to take effect except for the rate rollbacks and creation of a consumer 
advocacy corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman argued that the consumer advocacy provision conflicted with 
constitutional prohibitions against the creation of private corporations by 
initiative and thus should not even have gone on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The rate rollback, reduction and freeze, he said, were virtually unprecedented 
in the law and denied insurers their right to a fair return on their policies. 
Procedures for obtaining an exception to the cutbacks were too cumbersome and 
time-consuming to provide effective relief, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And if the rate cutbacks are struck down, the entire measure must be 
invalidated, Rothman contended. Sponsors had offered the voters a "free lunch" 
of popular but legally invalid rollbacks with the aim of achieving enactment of 
other less-noticed provisions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an effort to bait and switch," Rothman said. "They offered the 
California public something very appealing and exciting -- a 20% decrease in 
insurance rates -- and said that it wouldn't cost the voters a penny. 
Meanwhile, there were other parts of the initiative that remained effectively 
hidden." 
</P>
<P>
Mosk and Broussard pressed the attorney with questions, suggesting that it 
should be up to the industry to demonstrate factually that the rollbacks were 
confiscatory. But Rothman responded that the rate reduction process was 
unconstitutional on its face and should be struck down now. 
</P>
<P>
Two other attorneys, representing the American Council of Life &amp; Health 
Insurance of America and the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of 
California, joined Rothman in urging the court to declare the initiative 
invalid. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, named as a defendant in the suit, told the court that the 
initiative was a valid attempt to combat "sloth, waste and inefficiency" in the 
insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman vigorously questioned the attorney general, suggesting that under the 
initiative's procedures, it might take years for an insurance company to obtain 
relief from sharp cutbacks in rates. 
</P>
<P>
"Would it be legal to force companies to offer policies below cost for up to 
six years?" Kaufman asked. Van de Kamp replied that it was "inaccurate" to 
suggest that rate relief could not be expedited by both the insurance 
commissioner and, if necessary, the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman also sharply interrogated Karl M. Manheim, a Loyola Law School 
professor defending the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"How can the state of California require an insurance carrier to provide 
insurance at less than its cost?" asked the justice. The professor replied that 
the court should allow such a provision to take effect as a "rational" attempt 
to curtail rates, while allowing insurers an opportunity to challenge the 
rollbacks later as excessive.

2ND DEMOCRAT BACKS TOWER BUT DEFEAT IS SEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Even as a second Democrat joined with Republicans in supporting former Sen. 
John Tower as secretary of defense, Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) 
predicted Tuesday that President Bush's nominee will not be confirmed by the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that, when the vote occurs, the nominee will be rejected," declared 
Mitchell, a cautious vote-counter who until now had refused to predict the 
outcome of what is becoming one of the bitterest, most divisive Senate fights 
in recent history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dodd Supports Nominee 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's prediction apparently took into account the decision of Sen. 
Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) to join one other Democrat -- Sen. Howell Heflin 
of Alabama -- in supporting Tower. Heflin announced his position Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd, who had spent several weeks agonizing over his decision, said he decided 
to support Tower on the basis of the evidence -- not just because Tower was one 
of five senators who in 1967 voted against censuring Dodd's father, former Sen. 
Thomas Dodd, for financial misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
"I owe John Tower; I owe John Tower the same fairness and judgment he used 22 
years ago," he said. "I do not owe John Tower my vote." 
</P>
<P>
Then he added: "I have weighed the facts, and I have come to the belief that 
John Tower is qualified to serve as secretary of defense." 
</P>
<P>
Republicans, in what so far has been an unsuccessful search for a majority, 
have encountered a strong reluctance on the part of the remaining handful of 
undecided senators -- both Republicans and Democrats -- to cast the deciding 
vote in favor of Tower. 
</P>
<P>
"There are several Democrats who don't want to be the deciding vote," Sen. J. 
James Exon (D-Neb.) said. "There are several Republicans who don't want to be 
the deciding vote." 
</P>
<P>
The President needs at least five Democratic votes for Tower -- combined with a 
tie-breaking vote by Vice President Dan Quayle -- to overcome the Democrats' 
55-45 edge in the Senate. And he would need even more Democrats if Sen. Larry 
Pressler (R-S. D.) and several other wavering Republicans decide to vote 
against Tower. 
</P>
<P>
As the Senate debate dragged on for a fourth day, the strain of the long fight 
was apparent on the floor -- particularly in a sharp exchange between Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S. C.). Dole condemned 
Hollings for characterizing Tower as "Mr. Alcohol Abuser," but Hollings refused 
to back down. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Dole hotly objected to a decision by Senate Armed Services Committee 
Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) that authorized employees of the Senate's permanent 
investigating subcommittee to probe new allegations of public drunkenness by 
Tower -- including one alleged incident in a VIP lounge at Dallas-Ft. Worth 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Dole asserted that creation of what he called "the Nunn strike force" had 
demonstrated that Democrats were only out to get Tower. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush Reiterates Support 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, the President reiterated his support for Tower -- as he has 
frequently throughout the debate -- and challenged the 71 incumbent senators 
who served in the Senate with Tower to explain how he could be an alcohol 
abuser if none of them had ever seen him drunk. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had one single senator -- not one -- (who) served with him over the 
years say: 'I have seen him. My first-hand evidence is this man is ineligible 
because of his consumption of spirits,' " Bush said. "Not one. And isn't that a 
little bit unusual?" 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) replied that the President was operating under 
a misconception about the experience of the senators. "This senator has seen 
Sen. Tower under the influence of alcohol on this floor, as he has seen other 
senators," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, DeConcini acknowledged under close questioning by Republicans 
that he had never witnessed Tower "inebriated to the extent he could not 
perform his duties" -- a threshold that Republicans contend must be crossed if 
the nomination is to be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell then questioned whether senators could trust their own experience in 
light of Tower's admission that he drank to excess during part of his 24-year 
tenure in the chamber. "The argument that we didn't see him in that condition 
is completely undermined by the fact that he himself admits he had a problem of 
excess drinking during the 1970s," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N. D.) said that the results of a lengthy FBI 
investigation of Tower's drinking habits show him to be a true binge drinker. 
"When he ties one on, he's out of control, he can barely walk, he's not in a 
position to discharge the responsibilities of the secretary of defense," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell pleaded with the Republicans to wind up the debate and permit a vote, 
but Dole indicated that the GOP wanted to keep discussing the issue until a 
majority had been persuaded to support Tower. "This has just barely started," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still pending before the Senate is Dole's threat to bring to a vote the 
question of whether Tower may come to the Senate floor to defend himself 
against all charges of drunkenness, womanizing and conflict of interest. 
Democrats are expected to oppose the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Dole freely admitted that the proposal was part of his delaying tactic. 
</P>
<P>
It was Dole's statement on ABC's "This Week with David Brinkley" last Sunday 
that brought Hollings to the floor in a rage and precipitated an extraordinary 
shouting match between the two men. The minority leader had accused Hollings of 
leveling unjustified, "vicious personal attacks" on Tower. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a vicious attack on me when you do that kind of thing," Hollings said. 
"I challenge and request: when has anything been vicious, when has there been 
an attack?" 
</P>
<P>
Dole replied that he was referring to Hollings' characterization of Tower as 
"Mr. Alcohol Abuser," and he asked: "Where's the fairness in all of this?" 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Hollings replied that his characterization of Tower was justified by 
the FBI findings. He added: "I'll say it again, because that's the record, 
alcohol abuser." He said he disagreed with Tower's assertion on television last 
Sunday that excessive drinking does not constitute alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Dole had squared off with Nunn over the continuing investigation of 
Tower being conducted by the staff of the permanent subcommittee on 
investigations, also headed by Nunn. Dole argued that the FBI -- not Senate 
investigators -- should be investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Nunn announced that the White House had agreed to resume the 
FBI investigation of Tower. He said he had referred about 10 allegations to the 
agency, most of them involving alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Key senators are refusing to disclose how they will vote. Page 14.

FINDING MAY BE A STEP TOWARD AIDS VACCINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a finding that could help in the development of an AIDS vaccine, researchers 
for the first time have immunized monkeys against infection by a distant 
relative of the AIDS virus that causes a rare form of leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
The virus used in the vaccine, HTLV-1, has also been linked to multiple 
sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and certain other rare neurological 
conditions, and is endemic among intravenous drug users in certain eastern 
urban areas such as New York City. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spreading Virus 
</P>
<P>
The HTLV-1 virus is spread by the exchange of body fluids in the same fashion 
as the AIDS virus, and federal officials last year estimated that 2,800 people 
could be infected with it each year as a result of blood transfusions. During 
the last two months, the American Red Cross began screening all donated blood 
for the presence of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
Insights gained in the current research, which was done at Ohio State 
University, may show researchers which components of the AIDS virus must be 
present in a vaccine, according to Ohio State pathobiologist Richard G. Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen estimated that at least three years of further studies will be required 
before the vaccine can be tested in human beings. 
</P>
<P>
The Olsen group's research is "simply fascinating," said neurologist Steven J. 
Greenberg of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md. "I think it is 
going to be a source of great excitement in the neurological and virological 
communities." 
</P>
<P>
HTLV-1 (human T-lymphotrophic virus-1), discovered in the early 1980s by 
virologist Robert C. Gallo of the National Cancer Institute, is a member of an 
unusual family of viruses called retroviruses. Unlike most disease-producing 
viruses, whose genetic information is contained in the form of deoxyribonucleic 
acid (DNA) like that found in all animal and human cells, retroviruses encode 
their genetic information in ribonucleic acid (RNA). 
</P>
<P>
When a retrovirus infects a cell, a special viral enzyme must convert the RNA 
information into DNA before the virus can reproduce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Of the Same Type 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS virus is also a retrovirus, as is the feline leukemia virus, which is 
the No. 1 killer of domestic cats in the United States. Olsen and his 
colleagues previously developed a vaccine against the feline leukemia virus 
that is now widely used to protect pets, and they used the same technique to 
develop the HTLV-1 vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
HTLV-1 has been shown to cause adult T-cell leukemia and lymphoma, which are 
rare in the United States but are more common in Japan, Central Africa and the 
Caribbean basin. In January, Greenberg and a group from the Wistar Institute in 
Philadelphia reported independently that they had found traces of HTLV-1 or a 
virus very much like it in many patients with multiple sclerosis, a chronic 
disease of the central nervous system that afflicts about 250,000 people in the 
U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen has found traces of the virus in patients with lupus, an autoimmune 
disorder in which the victims' immune systems attack their connective tissues 
and internal organs. The virus has also been linked to exotic disorders, such 
as tropical spastic paraparesis, in which nerves on the limbs become paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen's vaccine does not contain the virus itself, but proteins that are 
secreted by HTLV-1-infected animal cells that are grown in the laboratory. The 
proteins he uses are precursors of the viral proteins -- that is, large 
proteins that must be trimmed by cellular machinery before they can be 
incorporated into viruses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Greater Immune Response 
</P>
<P>
In the development of the feline leukemia virus, Olsen found that these 
precursor proteins produce a greater immune response than the viral proteins 
themselves and are less likely to produce harmful effects. 
</P>
<P>
Both the cat vaccine and the HTLV-1 vaccine, furthermore, contained proteins 
from both the outer coating of the virus particle and the inner core. That is 
an important finding, Olsen argued, because most potential AIDS vaccines now 
being studied use only one type of protein or the other, and are thus less 
likely to be effective. "More than one protein is going to be necessary" for an 
AIDS vaccine, he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen injected nine macaque monkeys with the vaccine, then inoculated them and 
five nonvaccinated monkeys with STLV-1, a virtually identical monkey equivalent 
of HTLV-1. (The researchers used STLV-1 to ensure that the vaccination had not 
simply stimulated immunity to human products.) 
</P>
<P>
The unvaccinated animals, he reported at a recent meeting on retroviruses, all 
became persistently infected with the virus, showing virus activity in their 
white blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Monitored for Two Years 
</P>
<P>
But white blood cells from the nine vaccinated monkeys showed no evidence of 
viral activity, suggesting that the vaccine protected them from the virus. Some 
of the monkeys have been monitored for as long as two years without any traces 
of infection. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg and others have cautioned that further studies are necessary because 
HTLV-1 can insert its genetic information into the host cell's genes and remain 
hidden for two to four decades before triggering an active infection. Olsen 
agrees, and is now using sophisticated genetic engineering techniques to search 
for the viral genes in white blood cells from the vaccinated monkeys. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA hematologist Irvin S. Y. Chen warned that Olsen will have to conclusively 
demonstrate the safety of the vaccine before it can be tested in humans. Only 
about 1% of people infected by the virus actually develop disease, he said, so 
a vaccine would have to have a very low incidence of side effects to justify 
using it.

I discovered only too soon how quickly . . . you just fizzled into being his 
appendage. . . . Mandela's wife. Mandela's child. Mandela's niece. Thriving in 
his glory was the simplest cocoon to shield in from the glaring public, or to 
boost your extinct ego. I vowed that none of this would apply to me. 
</P>
<P>
Winnie Mandela, in "Higher Than Hope" 
</P>
<P>
On a summer's day in 1958, a dashing black lawyer named Nelson Mandela pulled 
his car over to the roadside and proposed marriage to the shy, doe-eyed 
23-year-old at his side. 
</P>
<P>
Winnie Madikizela should have been worried that her husband-to-be was on trial 
for treason. That he was 16 years her senior. And that his sophisticated 
friends regarded her as a flighty damsel too beautiful to be a revolutionary's 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
Years later, writing to Winnie from prison, Nelson Mandela admitted that he 
agonized over having "abandoned this young and inexperienced woman in a 
pitiless desert, literally throwing her into the hands of highwaymen." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stronger Than Believed 
</P>
<P>
Winnie Mandela turned out to be made of stronger fiber than anyone guessed. 
</P>
<P>
She raised two daughters and supported her husband's cause throughout 
relentless police raids, detentions, trials, interrogations, banning orders and 
banishment. And in time even her husband's colleagues replaced their disdain 
for her with respect. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, she and her young bodyguards have been linked to the killing of 
a teen-aged black activist and the abduction and beating of three others. She 
has been ostracized by anti-apartheid leaders and publicly criticized by her 
husband's exiled movement, the African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Some figure that Winnie Mandela was numbed by adoring sycophants and consumed 
by her own towering ego. Others say she was deceived by the hard-luck stories 
of wayward teen-agers and too naive to believe that they were using the Mandela 
name to terrorize other blacks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part Flint, Part Flower 
</P>
<P>
The truth is somewhere in between. Winnie Mandela is and always has been part 
flint and part flower -- combative, stubborn, willful and quick to anger, but 
also trusting, generous and charming, according to her closest friends and 
neighbors in Soweto as well as political analysts and senior figures in the 
anti-apartheid movement. 
</P>
<P>
But her supporters and detractors agree on one thing: The same streak of 
independence that earned her worldwide admiration also got her into trouble 
here at home with her fellow activists, who have always tried to protect the 
venerable name of Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
"That is Winnie; even in the early years, you would give advice to her and 
she'd listen, but then she'd do her own thing," said Fatima Meer, a University 
of Natal sociology professor and a friend of Winnie Mandela for 30 years. 
"That's how she survived the state's attacks on her -- by taking decisions on 
her own." 
</P>
<P>
Even as a child, Nomzamo Winnifred Madikizela had a reputation for being 
headstrong, and many sibling quarrels ended with a spanking for Winnie. Born 54 
years ago, she was the fourth daughter in a family that desperately wanted a 
son, and she was taller and stronger than other children her age. 
</P>
<P>
After high school, Winnie went to Johannesburg to study, with the aim of going 
into social work. Among the other girls she was often called "Lady Tarzan" 
because "I solved problems the simple way, using physical force, as I had done 
way back in my childhood, when I defended myself against older boys who came 
marauding into our mealie (corn) fields at harvest time," she recalled in 
"Higher Than Hope," a 1988 biography of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
She had just landed her first job in social work when she met Mandela. His 
friends found her charming but too young and politically inexperienced for 
someone of Mandela's stature in the black liberation movement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vivacious, Bright-Eyed 
</P>
<P>
"She was very vivacious, very bright-eyed," one of Mandela's friends remembered 
recently. "But we didn't take her seriously at all." 
</P>
<P>
Four years after the marriage, Mandela was convicted of sabotage and sent to 
prison for life. Over the next 15 years, his wife spent 17 months in solitary 
confinement, six years under banning orders that prevented her from talking 
with more than three people at a time and four years under house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
She grew more defiant and was frequently charged with violating her banning 
orders. In an attempt to silence her, the authorities banished her in 1977 to a 
three-room shack in the Orange Free State, the most conservative province in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
It was there, 300 miles from the fires of political activity in Soweto, that 
Winnie Mandela's independence and generosity transformed her into an 
international liberation figure in her own right. 
</P>
<P>
She staged a one-woman resistance campaign, to the dismay of the white 
authorities, by using stores, restaurants and public toilets that had been 
declared whites-only. At the same time, she provided bread and soup for hungry 
black children, started a community garden and turned her house into a medical 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats and politicians traveled to see her. She was honored with 
doctoral degrees and gifts from America and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, eight years after her banishment, she defied the government and 
returned to Soweto. The authorities forcibly evicted her, but she returned the 
next day. They arrested her again and again before a court ruled that she could 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Soweto, the township of 2.2 million outside Johannesburg, she opened an 
office and launched a project to send blacks to college. 
</P>
<P>
She also opened her home to young political activists. They called her "Mama," 
and she treated them like her children, cooking for them, clothing them and 
sending them to school. 
</P>
<P>
When "her boys," as she called them, wanted to form a soccer club, she got 
local Soweto businesses to chip in for uniforms and equipment. The uniforms 
carried the colors of the outlawed African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The Mandela United football club, as it came to be known, did not play many 
soccer matches. But its two dozen uniformed members accompanied Winnie Mandela 
to rallies, political funerals and news conferences, usually making a grand 
entrance shortly after the proceedings began. 
</P>
<P>
She began to enjoy having the retinue -- one anti-apartheid activist called it 
the "queen's guard" -- and being the center of attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Winnie has a feeling of self-importance, but it's not a false feeling," a 
friend said recently. "She is very important." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friends Loyal to Her 
</P>
<P>
The soccer club, and other people who stayed at the Mandela home, were 
obsequiously loyal. Even her relatives would leap nervously to their feet and 
bow their heads when she entered a room. Those dependent on her for their 
prestige as well as their next meal never dared disagree with Mama. 
</P>
<P>
"She was placed on a pedestal, and no one could tell her what to do," said a 
senior black activist who is under a banning order that prevents his being 
quoted by name. "She was surrounded by 'yes' people, and that distorted her 
judgment. She couldn't take people who said 'no.' " 
</P>
<P>
When out of her sight, members of the soccer club basked in the reflected glory 
of the "mother of the nation." They demanded free entry to a Soweto discotheque 
and swaggered around the township beating up people they didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors complained about the team, and anti-apartheid leaders urged Winnie 
Mandela to disband it. She would listen and often agree. But she never took 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Winnie Mandela had felt no strong links to the country's anti-apartheid 
organizations when she returned to Soweto, even though most opponents of 
apartheid look to her imprisoned 70-year-old husband as the country's true 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood was making movies about her. A 1985 autobiography called "Part of My 
Soul Went With Him" was a best-seller. She had become an industry. Last year, 
she agreed to allow a black American public relations man to market the Mandela 
name, but her husband canceled the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Winnie Mandela's independence struck many in the anti-apartheid movement as, at 
best, conduct unbecoming the wife of so important a leader -- and, at worst, 
plain arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, for example, she built a $250,000 home amid the shacks of Soweto, an 
ostentatious display that gave the government ammunition in its effort to 
undermine the credibility of the ANC. The house remains vacant. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a very unstable person with delusions of grandeur," said Mark Swilling, 
a professor at the Center for Policy Studies who has had Winnie Mandela as a 
political science student. She is working on an undergraduate degree in 
politics and social work. 
</P>
<P>
But others think she may have been manipulated by the soccer club. 
</P>
<P>
"She takes in people. She won't question them. She will take them at face 
value," said Meer, the sociology professor who compiled "Higher Than Hope." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Mandela home was burned down by youths allegedly provoked by a 
Mandela United assault on a schoolgirl. Another community delegation pleaded 
with Winnie Mandela to get the team out of her house. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to Winnie, but her attitude was that no one would tell her what to 
do," a senior anti-apartheid leader said. "That's been her attitude all along. 
Had she been less individualistic, she wouldn't find herself in this position 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Police contend that members of the Mandela soccer club and others of her 
friends abducted four young activists at a Methodist church hostel in Soweto on 
Dec. 29 and drove to the house where Winnie Mandela now stays. 
</P>
<P>
In their affidavits, according to sources who have seen them, three of the four 
say that Winnie Mandela arrived and began beating the four. The sworn 
statements say the attack was taken over by the Mandela bodyguards and that one 
of the four, 14-year-old Stompie Mokhetsi Seipei, was severely beaten. His 
body, identified by fingerprints, was found Jan. 7, the police said. 
</P>
<P>
Winnie Mandela denies that she or her bodyguards were involved in the beatings. 
She says the youths were abducted to protect them from a church pastor who had 
been sexually abusing them. The pastor and the church have denied this 
allegation. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, Winnie Mandela did what she wanted, when she wanted, the white 
government be damned. She still does what she wants, when she wants. But these 
days, that means ignoring advice from her husband's most ardent supporters in 
the anti-apartheid movement. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't jealous of Winnie," said one of the liberation leaders responsible 
for shunning her. "But we're jealous for her name -- Mandela. It is being used 
to deprive people of life and liberty, which is against everything we're in 
business for." 
</P>
<P>
Winnie Mandela, meanwhile, remains loyal to her boys. Only a few days ago, she 
was in her office on the telephone, busily hiring attorneys for the eight 
people arrested so far in the case and insisting on their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"She can be terribly exasperating," Meer said. "But she's not what they say she 
is."

INVESTIGATION OF INSURANCE FIRM'S COLLAPSE DEMANDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were calls from several quarters Tuesday for a comprehensive Insurance 
Department investigation into the collapse of Coastal Insurance Co., and one 
industry source said he had been informed that there will be an official 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was learned that all California auto insurance policyholders will 
be assessed a surcharge of up to 1% on their premiums so that the 
state-appointed, industry-administered California Insurance Guarantee Assn. can 
pay off claims against Coastal's 200,000 auto insurance policies in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Association Director John W. Gates estimated Tuesday that this will cost 
between $80 million and $100 million. That means California's approximately 13 
million auto insurance policyholders each will pay an average of $6 to $8 extra 
to meet Coastal's claims obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie stopped short of saying that there will 
be an investigation of Coastal's demise. 
</P>
<P>
"Any and all actions taken by the Department of Insurance in the Coastal matter 
will be taken to the court," said Gillespie, referring to the Coastal 
bankruptcy case. "The matter is pending before the court and there will be no 
statements from the department apart from those proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
But Harry O. Miller, chief executive of the defunct company, said he had no 
doubt there will be an inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the Department of Insurance always conducts one (in such 
bankruptcies), and I'm sure they will here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He has attributed the collapse of Coastal to mounting claims and an adverse 
environment for the auto insurance business in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
Those calling for an inquiry said they thought it should go beyond a cursory 
exploration and provide a detailed public explanation of why Coastal failed. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, in an uncontested action, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Dzintra 
Janavs complied with a Gillespie request and ordered Coastal liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the general policyholder surcharge to pay off Coastal claims, some 
consumer representatives said Tuesday that the Insurance Department should be 
required to explain why its regulatory oversight was unable to prevent 
Coastal's failure. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Miller, head of the Insurance Consumer Action Network, criticized 
Gillespie for being unwilling to provide information thus far. Miller, no 
relation to Harry Miller, said Gillespie has been referring everyone to the 
documents filed by her department when it sought the liquidation order. But he 
said he had perused the documents and they provided no details about what 
caused the company to fail. 
</P>
<P>
"It is incumbent on the insurance commissioner to go into this entire matter," 
said Westwood attorney Joseph Moreno, who said he represented a number of 
clients in claims against Coastal that were not honored. 
</P>
<P>
Moreno said Coastal had stopped paying its claims in December, several weeks 
before Gillespie's Feb. 2 action placing the company into conservatorship. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Coastal's own highest-paid salesmen were kept uninformed that the 
company was in financial difficulty, said Donna Miccio, wife of Coastal 
salesman John Miccio, who also urged an investigation. The Redondo Beach 
housewife said her husband had come back from a week's vacation in February to 
be told that he and 1,300 other employees were out of their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Going beyond calling for an inquiry was Harry Snyder, West Coast director of 
the Consumers Union. He said a seizure of assets from Coastal managers should 
precede any surcharge on policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of the state's policyholders should not pay one penny until all the 
officers and shareholders of Coastal have been required to give up all their 
gains," Snyder said. "This is another case where the executives leave a trail 
of disaster to be picked up by the average citizen, while they continue with 
their high-living ways." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Harry Miller, the chief executive of both Coastal and its parent 
company, Advent Management, was responsible last year for giving or lending 
more than $5 million to support an insurance initiative rejected by 87% of the 
electorate. He questioned why there should be a policyholder surcharge to pay 
off such losses. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Miller declined comment on Snyder's points.

4.7 QUAKE MAY BE ONLY A PRECURSOR, SCIENTISTS BELIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey said Tuesday that there is about a 
30% chance that the 4.7-magnitude earthquake that rattled the Imperial Valley 
on Monday afternoon will be followed by a stronger quake within the next week. 
</P>
<P>
But it will probably do little damage in the sparsely populated region, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lucile Jones, a seismologist in the Geological Survey's Pasadena office, said 
there is no reason to believe that the recent swarm of earthquakes near the 
southern tip of Salton Sea is likely to trigger a major quake on the San 
Andreas Fault. The quakes have been occurring in a region called the Brawley 
Seismic Zone, and the largest quake on record in that area is a 5.7 temblor in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are monitoring the region along the southern leg of the San Andreas 
closely because of concerns that smaller quakes in the area could trigger a 
catastrophic quake on that long-dormant leg of the great fault. But the most 
recent swarm of earthquakes is not considered a likely candidate because they 
are too far from the San Andreas Fault. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fault's Location 
</P>
<P>
"There's something of a question as to where the San Andreas ends," Jones said. 
The southern end of the fault is probably at least 10 miles north of the 
Brawley Seismic Zone, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"If it extended down through the Salton Sea, this would be quite close to it, 
and we would really be worried," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Based on historical experience, if the 4.7 quake is a foreshock to a larger 
temblor, the main quake should occur no more than five miles from the epicenter 
of the 4.7 temblor -- and probably much closer, Jones said. That would place 
the main shock -- if it is yet to come -- a safe distance from the San Andreas. 
</P>
<P>
The quakes, which she described as "a very active sequence," are occurring in a 
region known for earthquake swarms characterized by scores of small quakes that 
would be hardly noticeable even in the immediate vicinity and some that range 
up to magnitude 5. However, since the area is so sparsely populated, even the 
larger quakes usually produce very little, if any, damage. 
</P>
<P>
The Brawley Seismic Zone is a bit of an oddity among fault systems in that it 
is believed to be a "spreading center" where the Earth's crust is literally 
being torn apart as two giant tectonic plates slowly separate. Tectonic plates 
-- the huge slabs of crust that support the continents and the oceans -- crunch 
together in some parts of the globe, pull apart in others and slide under one 
another in still others. 
</P>
<P>
In California, that process produces the San Andreas Fault because the Pacific 
Plate is sliding slowly north past the North American Plate. 
</P>
<P>
Most spreading centers are under the oceans, but the Brawley Seismic Zone has 
been covered with sediment from the Colorado River and is thus located on land, 
making it a rare spreading center. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is not expected to produce a great quake, residents of wide areas 
of Southern California should expect a little shaking for a while yet.

FARMERS ACCUSED OF MISUSING $10 MILLION IN DELTA DISASTER AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State and federal auditors have charged that Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta 
farmers misused upward of $10 million in disaster aid to save their sinking 
islands from floods and are preparing a demand that it be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
Auditors charged that there were instances of double-billing, charges for 
material that apparently was not delivered and widespread overcharges for rock 
and sand that was used to bolster island levees in the delta. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a fiduciary duty that needs to be exercised. I don't think it 
was," said Charles F. Wynne, a state Office of Emergency Services official who 
is overseeing the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few thousand people live on 60 major islands, scattered among 700 miles 
of rivers and sloughs in the delta. The islands are used for farming. But they 
also are an important part of California's water system, especially as it 
serves Southern California. The islands hold back saltwater intrusion from San 
Francisco Bay, thereby allowing state and federal officials to pump fresh water 
south. 
</P>
<P>
When islands fail, saltwater intrudes into the environmentally sensitive delta, 
habitat to many species of fish, birds and other animals. To hold the brackish 
water back from the delta, fresh water that could be used for farming and 
drinking must be released from reservoirs upstream. 
</P>
<P>
Delta levees often fail in high water. To save their islands, farmers say they 
must act quickly, first by placing sandbags along their levees and then laying 
down large rocks as a more permanent barrier. But in order to get paid by 
disaster assistance agencies, the farmers must act through their reclamation 
districts, which are required to maintain records of how assistance funds are 
spent. 
</P>
<P>
Wynne is scheduled to begin a series of meetings today in which he will go 
island-by-island to determine exactly how much money each reclamation district 
must repay. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Wynne characterized the districts' record-keeping as a "mess." 
When district officials did produce records, the documentation was 
insufficient, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that since some work was done, some money should be paid. But he also 
estimated that as much as 25% of the $42.6 million spent on fighting severe 
flooding in 1983 could end up being disallowed and may have to be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
"A 25% cutoff in the claims would be akin to a disaster," said Dante Nomellini, 
a Stockton attorney for several districts. "If that is the net result, the one 
thing that will have been learned will be that the biggest disaster is disaster 
assistance." 
</P>
<P>
Some farmer-run reclamation districts could be forced into bankruptcy if they 
must repay the Office of Emergency Services and the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, Nomellini said. Nomellini raised the possibility that if 
there are floods this year, the financially strapped districts will be unable 
to respond. 
</P>
<P>
The potential size of the claim for reimbursement has concerned bankers, who 
have lent money to the districts. Some districts have had to renegotiate their 
debt repayments. 
</P>
<P>
"The financial integrity of reclamation districts is at stake," said Doug 
Eberhardt, executive vice president of the Bank of Stockton, which is holding 
$10.2 million worth of warrants from various districts. 
</P>
<P>
If the districts are forced to repay the money and go into bankruptcy, the 
state or federal government could be forced to take over the islands in order 
to save them and ensure that fresh water continues to flow to Southern 
California and San Joaquin Valley farmers. 
</P>
<P>
The financial effects are only one of the districts' problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency's inspector general has opened a "much 
more in-depth" investigation of disaster assistance in the delta to determine 
whether there were violations that could result in criminal, civil or 
administrative actions, said F. Gerry McGrath, assistant inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
Wynne characterized his role as that of a mediator between the districts and 
state and federal auditors, whose reports issued during the past year and a 
half have recommended that state and federal disaster agencies pay almost none 
of the $42.6 million in costs claimed by the districts for the 1983 floods. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Emergency Management Agency audits obtained by The Times show it 
recommended payment of only $754,000 out of the $15.3 million being sought by 
three reclamation districts for the 1983 flood. 
</P>
<P>
The state controller, which audited several other districts for the 1983 flood, 
concluded that $25.8 million of the $27.3 million in claimed expenses should be 
disallowed. 
</P>
<P>
Although the investigation focuses on the 1983 flooding, the same approach most 
likely will apply to flood costs in 1986, when several delta islands again were 
flooded. In all, state and federal agencies have spent $120 million to fight 
delta floods during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
An audit by the Federal Emergency Management Agency showed that Rindge Tract, 
one of the farming islands, billed the state and federal government for the 
same work -- more than $870,234 for rock, levee widening and dredging. 
</P>
<P>
In another instance, a reclamation district estimated the cost of repairing 
erosion damage at from $160,000 to $223,000. By the time the work was done, the 
cost skyrocketed to $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Federal auditors noted that when the districts paid for rock out of their own 
money, the price was anywhere from $11.85 to $14.50 per ton. When the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency paid for the rock, the price was as much as $20 a 
ton. Commonly, thousands of tons of rock are needed to fix a failing levee. 
</P>
<P>
Nomellini insisted that instances of double-billing were mistakes. He 
maintained that the districts will prove to the state and federal governments 
that there was virtually no overcharging and called audits a "hatchet job." 
</P>
<P>
He said documentation for the 1983 flood is better than it was in previous 
floods and blamed changes in the state and federal standards for many of the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"If the same standards for review (in past years) had been applied, then these 
claims would get an A-plus-plus rating," he said. " . . . All of a sudden what 
was historically found to be acceptable was rejected in total."

BIG CATS ARE NO PROBLEM; IT'S LAWS HE CAN'T TAME

<P>
Joe Maynard is a tough-talking trucker who loves exotic big cats but has a hard 
time getting along with the state officials who try to regulate how he cages 
and cares for his rare leopards and tigers. 
</P>
<P>
"They try to tell us how to run things, but they've got no expertise 
whatsoever," said Maynard, a wiry, bearded man who spends 14 days at a time as 
a cross-country truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
Maynard and his wife Jeanne run the Exotic Feline Breeding Compound Inc. a 
private, nonprofit zoo located west of this small desert town in Kern County, 
about 80 miles north of Los Angeles. Many of the 40 wild cats caged here are 
endangered species, some are owned by zoos that have loaned them to Maynard for 
breeding. 
</P>
<P>
State regulators say the Maynards are operating a zoo without proper 
accreditation and have been keeping wild animals without a state permit that 
has been required since 1985, when new animal protection laws went into effect. 
The facility does not meet new state standards, primarily because its cages are 
too small, state inspectors say. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to 1985, the compound was exempt from state regulation because it was 
classified as a private zoo, officials said. But under the new law, such 
facilities must meet standards set by the American Assn. of Zoos, Parks and 
Aquariums, a national organization created to upgrade animal protection and 
public safety criteria. 
</P>
<P>
Already operating on a shoestring budget funded by donations and paid 
memberships in their zoo, the Maynards said, they want to upgrade their cages 
to association standards but have little money with which to do so. They have 
built one big new cage, for the snow leopards, but most of their funds must go 
for care and breeding, Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
"The bureaucrats in Sacramento are wrong. . . . We have a bona fide zoo," 
Maynard argued, claiming that the compound should be exempt from state 
regulations because it is a designated federal research facility and has the 
necessary federal permits to handle and transport endangered species. State 
officials agree that he has the federal permits, but say the new state rules 
must be applied. 
</P>
<P>
Maynard has little nice to say about state officials, but his whole demeanor 
changes when he walks among the big cats, talking about breeding programs and 
the need to keep the rare cats from becoming extinct. He is gentle with the 
felines. 
</P>
<P>
"All my life I've loved big cats," he explained. He bought his first leopard 20 
years ago for $600. The couple lived in Northridge then. "I wanted to breed . . 
. these leopards because they were being killed off and I wanted to do 
something to save them." 
</P>
<P>
The Maynards moved from Northridge to Simi Valley, then to Kern County in 1977, 
buying 68 acres to make room for their cats. Doing the work himself, Maynard 
built the cages and fenced off the compound. In 1983 the Maynards formed the 
nonprofit corporation and sold 2,000 memberships to finance the operation. Last 
year they raised $134,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Maynard has no college degrees, he has a good reputation among zoo 
professionals active in the work of saving exotic cats. Breeding the animals in 
captivity is essential to the effort to save them from extinction, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
The Maynards' unusual collection includes seven North Chinese leopards, a pair 
of snow leopards from the Himalayas, on loan from the San Diego Zoo, several 
big Siamese tigers and three tiny Temminck's Golden Cats. The compound -- a 
haphazard mix of old cages, new construction and mobile homes -- is open to the 
public, without charge. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got one of the best collections (of North Chinese) leopards in the 
country . . . in terms of genetics." said veterinarian Allen Schoemaker of the 
Riverbank Zoo in Charlotte, N.C. Schoemaker keeps breeding records on the 90 
Chinese leopards in captivity. No one knows how many of these rare cats still 
exist in the wilds of northern China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Competent' 
</P>
<P>
"His knowledge of (big cats) . . . is very superior from what you'd expect in 
the private sector," said Pat Morris, a zoo veterinarian and assistant 
professor of wildlife medicine at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. 
Morris, one of Maynard's medical consultants, added, "He is very competent." 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Fish and Game officials concede that Maynard cares about 
animals but insist that his facilities must now meet state standards. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past we had no serious problems with him, but the law has changed," 
said Celeste Cushman, a department spokeswoman. The state's caging and fencing 
standards had to be upgraded to protect both the animals and the public, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Maynards' cats are housed in cages that are about 10 by 20 feet. 
Each contains a heavy plywood shelter. The flooring is dirt and few of the 
cages have double-gated entryways to prevent escapes. As Maynard builds new 
cages, he is adding these safety features. 
</P>
<P>
When the Maynards failed to comply with the department's demands, the state 
Fish and Game Commission stepped into the controversy. At first the Maynards 
refused to participate in commission hearings, but in February they appeared to 
present their case. The commission gave the couple 90 days to come up with a 
plan detailing how they will meet state standards within three years. 
</P>
<P>
"No one wants to take animals away from him," said Harold C. Cribbs, the 
commission's executive secretary. Cribbs said the department has been 
cooperating with Maynard on developing such a plan. If a plan cannot be worked 
out, the commission could seize the animals, Cribbs said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, state game wardens are asking the Kern County district 
attorney to file misdemeanor charges against the Maynards for importing a North 
Chinese leopard in January, in violation of a department order. The animal is 
on loan from the Omaha Zoo. The state had instructed the couple not to obtain 
any more animals until they are in compliance with state laws. 
</P>
<P>
Maynard denied that he violated the law, saying that he had a valid federal 
permit to transport the leopard from Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
"They (state wardens) came here with the cops . . . (and) said we'd brought 
that cat in illegally," Maynard said. Zoo keepers who work with the Maynards on 
a regular basis say they are not put off by the compound's physical facilities 
because the couple cares for its animals and works to preserve threatened 
species. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true their facilities . . . don't meet (public) zoo standards," said Dr. 
Lee Simmons, director of the Omaha Zoo. "But by all reports . . . Joe Maynard 
doesn't fall short on animal care. . . . (He) really cares about his animals."

POPE TO BEGIN 4 DAYS OF TALKS WITH U.S. PRELATES TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

VATICAN CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pope John Paul II will begin four days of talks with three dozen American 
prelates here today in an effort to reassert papal authority over the 
independent-minded U.S. Roman Catholic church. 
</P>
<P>
Although relations between the American church and the Vatican are strained, 
they have improved of late, and spokesmen for both the Pope and the 36 American 
cardinals and archbishops insist that the encounter will not be 
confrontational. 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for it, though, the pontiff has carefully chosen the players, 
written the program and arranged the playing field to his own liking. 
</P>
<P>
The main theme in 10 give-and-take sessions will be the proper role of bishops, 
although other concerns of the American church may also be brought up, ranging 
from lay preachers to a greater role for women. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Forum Is Open' 
</P>
<P>
"This is an occasion to discuss all issues," papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro 
said Tuesday. "The forum is open." 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the unusual meeting is described as a summation of the Pope's 1987 
visit to the United States and of regularly scheduled visits here last year by 
groups of American bishops. The Vatican has titled it "Evangelization in the 
Context of the Culture and Society of the United States, With Particular 
Emphasis on the Role of the Bishop as the Teacher of the Faith." 
</P>
<P>
Bishops are the church's spiritual and administrative supervisors at the 
diocesan level. The participants include the five active U.S. cardinals, from 
Chicago, Washington, Boston, New York and Detroit. Among the archbishops are 
Roger Mahony of Los Angeles and John Quinn of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Although the talk around the Vatican on Tuesday was of "a meeting of brothers," 
the idea for it grew out of adversarial viewpoints. In 1986, American bishops 
called for a meeting with John Paul to discuss "the growing and dangerous 
disaffection" of American Catholics from the Holy See as a result of Vatican 
sanctions against a liberal theologian and an archbishop judged too lenient in 
enforcing church teachings. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1987 papal visit to the United States and subsequent calls on the 
Vatican by American bishops, relations improved, and the bishops withdrew their 
request for a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope, who has had similar encounters with feuding Dutch bishops and 
free-thinking Brazilians, decided the meeting was a good idea. The U.S. 
Bishops' Conference then elected delegates to the meeting. But the Pope decided 
to choose the delegates himself and named the cardinals and archbishops who 
head the nation's largest dioceses. 
</P>
<P>
A suggested American agenda for the meeting would have focused on the role of 
the church in light of America's singular cultural and secular traditions. 
Instead, the Vatican turned the focus more on the role of the bishops. 
</P>
<P>
The American bishops have brought their own press spokesman, a priest, to Rome 
for the meeting, but he will not attend the sessions. The Pope's spokesman, a 
layman, will attend. He will give all the post-meeting briefings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pope to Open Session 
</P>
<P>
The Pope will open the meeting this afternoon with an address. Archbishop John 
May of St. Louis, president of the Bishops' Conference, will respond. Then will 
come the first of the discussions on specific issues -- all, according to 
American sources, selected by the Vatican and submitted to the U.S. bishops in 
the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
At each session, a Curia cardinal will speak for the Vatican. He will be 
followed by an American prelate speaking for the U.S. church. Discussion is to 
follow, with the Pope in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
The theme-setting opening session is entitled "The Bishop as Teacher of the 
Faith." Cardinal Joseph A. Ratzinger, the conservative West German who heads 
the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, is paired with 
Cardinal John J. O'Connor, the archbishop of New York. Vatican and American 
sources agree that John Paul is eager to re-emphasize his conviction that a 
bishop's first priority must be as a teacher of the faith directly responsive 
to the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope reportedly mistrusts the emergence of the U.S. Bishops' Conference as 
a teaching body and has no time for American theologians who, he feels, have 
too freely interpreted church dogma. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope also dislikes the permissiveness that allows some American Catholics 
to follow some church teachings but to ignore others. The bishops will likely 
be lectured on the need to teach adherence to the Vatican rejection of 
artificial birth control. 
</P>
<P>
When he met American bishops in Los Angeles in September, 1987, the Pope told 
them to combat "dissent from church doctrine." Since then, he has also warned 
against allowing individual priests and parishes to set their own rules on such 
practices as how the sacraments are administered. 
</P>
<P>
While in general approving the vigor of the American church, the Pope has been 
critical of what he considers the too-temporal attitude of American Catholics 
and their undue laxity where moral issues are concerned. The bishops may, for 
example, hear fresh papal complaint against too many annulments of marriages 
gone bad.

IRA SHOTS KILL 3, INCLUDING 2 ELDERLY MEN 
</P>

<P>
Two gunmen jumped out of a stolen car and opened fire with automatic weapons at 
a village garage near here Tuesday afternoon, killing the garage owner and two 
elderly men standing with him, the police reported. 
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcasting Corp. reported that the garage owner's wife and 
teen-age children are believed to have witnessed the attack -- and that the 
gunmen cheered as they drove off. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army, in a statement to the local news media, took 
responsibility for the killings. The statement said the garage was a stronghold 
of the illegal Ulster Volunteer Force, an armed Protestant group. But police 
said the shooting was "indiscriminate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tit-for-Tat Violence 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred in Coagh, about 50 miles west of here, and was the latest 
in what Northern Ireland security authorities describe as a worrisome spate of 
tit-for-tat sectarian violence in which 16 people have been killed this year. 
</P>
<P>
Coagh is a predominantly Protestant village identified with the majority of the 
people in Northern Ireland who want to remain a part of the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Volunteer Force claimed responsibility last month for killing John 
Joe Davey, a town councilor from the same general area who represented the 
nationalist Sinn Fein party. Sinn Fein, which wants the British out of Northern 
Ireland, is the legal political arm of the outlawed IRA. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's shooting was considered noteworthy because of an IRA pledge to 
"refine" its activities after a year in which its operatives killed 23 
civilians in bungled attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Jerry Adams told a party conference in Dublin five weeks ago 
that there had been "an exceptional and regrettable level of civilian 
casualties arising from IRA operations" in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The IRA is believed to be responsible for killing 33 soldiers and 6 policemen 
in the province last year. Illegal Protestant groups are blamed for 22 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
The police said that at least three men drove up to Leslie Dallos' garage in 
Coagh shortly after 4 p.m. Tuesday in a red Vauxhall auto that had been stolen 
shortly before. Two of the men jumped out and sprayed the garage with gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Dallos was killed instantly, as was 72-year-old Ernie Rankin, a pensioner, 
according to the police. A second pensioner, Austin Nelson, 61, died of wounds 
on the way to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, a former truck driver, had taken up violin-making in retirement and was 
featured on a local television newscast Monday evening. He said he hoped that 
through his hobby he could make a lasting contribution to the world. 
</P>
<P>
Garage owner Dallos was described as a drag-racing enthusiast in his early 40s. 
His wife was reportedly visiting the garage at the time of the shooting. His 
teen-age children were among a group of youngsters who witnessed the killings 
as they were getting off a school bus nearby. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arms, Ammo Discovered 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, authorities in northern England reported Tuesday that 
they had found a cache of arms and ammunition and a large quantity of 
high-explosive Semtex buried in a wooded area near the seaside town of 
Scarborough. 
</P>
<P>
Officials pointed out that in 10 days Scarborough is to be the site of a 
conference of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party and that 
Thatcher is expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, IRA assassins bombed the hotel where Thatcher and members of her 
Cabinet were staying in Brighton during a Conservative Party convention. Five 
people were killed in the explosion, but the prime minister was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
There have been a number of other IRA bombings in recent months aimed at 
military targets in England. The police have uncovered other caches of 
explosives, which the IRA is believed to have acquired through Libya.

8 UNCOMMITTED SENATORS TIE UP DECISION ON TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a classic Catch-22 situation. 
</P>
<P>
Until the full Senate casts its vote on the nomination of John Tower as defense 
secretary, key senators are refusing to disclose how they will vote. At the 
same time, Republicans are refusing to agree to a vote until they are certain 
of the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
That, in short, is the perplexing political knot that has tied up the Senate 
for the last week, prolonging the debate on President Bush's controversial 
nominee to head the Pentagon, even though most members are ready to vote. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) tried without 
success to persuade members of the Senate to end the misery. "There is one way 
to end it and that is to vote on the nomination," he said. "That's what the 
Constitution mandates." 
</P>
<P>
But Mitchell's plea fell on deaf ears. At least eight senators -- Republicans 
as well as Democrats -- stubbornly remained publicly uncommitted, even though 
the issue has been preoccupying them and other senators to the exclusion of all 
else almost since the day Tower was nominated, last Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
The list of uncommitted still includes five Democrats -- Lloyd Bentsen of 
Texas, J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, Joseph 
I. Lieberman of Connecticut and Charles S. Robb of Virginia -- and three 
Republicans -- Larry Pressler of South Dakota, Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas 
and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
At least two of the Democrats -- Bentsen and Johnston -- have indicated that 
they do not intend to disclose their decisions until the last minute. 
Ironically, these are two of the Senate's most influential men and the very 
Democrats who are viewed by the President's aides as the most likely to break 
with their party. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen's ties to Tower are obvious. The two men served as fellow Texans in the 
Senate until 1984, when Tower retired after 24 years in the chamber. Like 
Bentsen, Johnston has a long history of independence in the votes he casts. On 
Tuesday, he acknowledged that while he and Tower were never "chums," they have 
always shared a sense of mutual respect. 
</P>
<P>
The other three uncommitted Democrats are more likely to announce their 
decisions soon, although Pell has indicated that he is in no hurry. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Lieberman, a freshman, who is expected to announce his 
decision as early as today, had been waiting for Christopher J. Dodd -- the 
senior Democratic senator from Connecticut -- to disclose how he will vote. 
Dodd said Tuesday he will support Tower. 
</P>
<P>
Although Robb has declined to discuss his reasons for postponing a decision, he 
is believed to be wrestling with two competing factors -- his belief as a 
former governor that the chief executive should be allowed to select his own 
Cabinet and his longtime friendship with Senate Armed Services Committee 
Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), Tower's leading critic. 
</P>
<P>
On the Republican side of the aisle, Pressler got public attention for his 
early declaration that he was leaning heavily against Tower because of his work 
on behalf of defense contractors -- a background that Pressler thinks would 
leave the nominee unable to reform the procurement system at the Pentagon. 
Nevertheless, Pressler has not closed the door to voting for him. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Republican sources who declined to be identified expressed optimism 
that both Kassebaum and Grassley will support Tower when the final votes are 
cast. 
</P>
<P>
Kassebaum said Tuesday that while she has been publicly uncommitted -- and 
intends to hold her silence until the final hour -- she has told the President 
in confidence how she intends to vote. Many senators assume that Kassebaum's 
reluctance to support Tower is based on what some have described as his 
"indiscreet" behavior involving women. 
</P>
<P>
Grassley, another senator with a reputation for independence, also told 
reporters once again Tuesday that he has nothing to say on the subject of the 
Tower nomination.

The District of Columbia Council, in an emergency action aimed at drug-related 
violence, voted Tuesday to require that people convicted of using guns in 
committing crimes must be sentenced to five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
It also approved a bill, intended to improve the district's before-trial 
detention program, to allow judges to refuse bond for suspects in violent 
crimes even if they have no criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an emergency bill and requires a lot of debate, but these are 
emergency times," council member James Nathanson said. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency measure, to remain in effect for 90 days before a review, came as 
the city sought to slow the pace of drug-related killings. Police say that 
about 60% of last year's record 372 homicides were drug-related. So far this 
year, 98 people have been slain in the district, 43 more than during the 
equivalent period of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation also attempts to stem the flow of illegally purchased weapons. 
According to police statistics, 3,863 such weapons were seized on district 
streets during 1988, compared with 2,225 the year before.

George Sanchez, known as the "ski mask rapist," was found guilty Tuesday by a 
Superior Court judge of 115 crimes against women in nine Bay Area communities. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old sewage worker faced multiple charges of rape, oral copulation, 
assault and burglary. The victims were 26 women, ranging in age from 16 to 83, 
from February, 1985, to November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez preyed on women living near churches or church-operated schools, 
commiting sexual assaults and stealing jewelry -- which he gave to his wife, 
according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Clara, 28, was charged with 13 counts of possessing stolen property. 
Sanchez, the father of two, agreed to waive his right to trial on the condition 
that charges against his wife be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Paul R. Teilh reviewed the evidence presented against Sanchez in a 
preliminary hearing in September and then found him guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Margo Smith said Sanchez could be sentenced to life in 
prison without possibility of parole.

LEWIS MAILERS NOT FORGERY UNDER LAW, ATTORNEYS SAY 
</P>

Lawyers for Assemblyman John R. Lewis asked a Superior Court judge Tuesday to 
dismiss felony forgery charges against the Orange County Republican, contending 
that the state's forgery statutes do not apply to Lewis' involvement in sending 
campaign letters bearing a phony signature of former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
The motion, filed by defense attorney Clyde M. Blackmon, will delay Lewis' 
arraignment until at least late April. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon contended in the motion that the crime of forgery requires an intent 
to defraudsomeone of money or property rights. Even if Lewis caused the fake 
Reagan signature to be placed on thousands of campaign letters sent to voters 
in 1986, Blackmon argued, the assemblyman's action did not "involve deprivation 
of any tangible right to money or property." 
</P>
<P>
He compared the Lewis case to a 1987 case in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 
that the term "fraud" did not refer to such intangible rights as the right to 
honesty in government. 
</P>
<P>
"The necessary intent to defraud cannot be found based on a mere intent to 
influence the judgment or opinion of the voting public," Blackmon wrote. 
</P>
<P>
W. Scott Thorpe, who is prosecuting Lewis for the state attorney general's 
office, would not comment directly on the defense motion. But he said his 
office believes the forgery charge will withstand the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Statute Applicable' 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the intent to defraud the public, in this case the voters, is 
covered by this statute," Thorpe said. "We think the forgery statute is 
applicable to his conduct." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, 34, of Orange, was indicted Feb. 6 by the Sacramento County Grand Jury 
on one count of forgery for his role in mailing the letters, which were sent on 
behalf of six Republican candidates for the Assembly in 1986. The White House 
denied that the endorsements were authorized by Reagan or any of his aides. 
</P>
<P>
Before returning the indictment, the grand jury heard testimony from nine 
witnesses, including political consultants, direct mail specialists, and staff 
members of the Assembly Republicans' campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
The transcript of those secret proceedings, which under state law could have 
been made public Monday, has been sealed while Lewis' lawyers argue their 
contention that its release would endanger his right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge James Morris, who is handling the pretrial maneuvering in 
the Lewis case, ruled Tuesday that the transcript should remain sealed for at 
least one more week. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's office and lawyers for the Los Angeles Times and the 
Sacramento Bee argued against sealing the 350-page document. In papers filed 
with the court, the prosecutor and the newspapers contended that the publicity 
surrounding the case would not significantly deplete the large pool of jurors 
available in Sacramento County. 
</P>
<P>
The transcript is expected to be politically damaging because it is likely to 
provide an insider's look at the GOP campaign operation. The same witnesses 
interviewed by the grand jury told state investigators that Lewis and former 
Assembly Republican Leader Pat Nolan of Glendale instructed their staffs to lie 
to White House officials looking into the incident.

JAMES FLANIGAN: TIME WARNER MIXES VISION AND POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's really behind the proposed merger of Warner Communications and Time 
Inc.? Both vision and muscle -- a grand vision of global entertainment and a 
calculated grab for market power. 
</P>
<P>
The vision looks ahead to the time when movies will be beamed directly from 
film studios to high-definition television screens in homes and theaters 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
It is a vision that has captivated Hollywood for a long time. In 1962, Darryl 
F. Zanuck, the founder of 20th Century Fox, was asked if television would 
replace movies. No, said Zanuck, movies would not only survive alongside 
television, they would thrive. The time would come, he said, "when I will make 
a movie on Friday, distribute it on Saturday and recoup my investment over the 
weekend." 
</P>
<P>
He was talking about instant worldwide distribution of entertainment -- which 
is the real promise of high-definition television, the clear-picture, 
big-screen TV that Japan is developing. It's the vision driving Sony Corp., 
which is angling to buy a movie studio as it looks to globally distribute 
entertainment and information. It's the vision driving entrepreneur Rupert 
Murdoch, who has put together the Fox movie studio, the Fox television network 
and a satellite TV service in Europe called Sky Channel. 
</P>
<P>
And it's the vision behind the combination of Warner, the descendant of the 
Warner Bros. studio that made Edward G. Robinson and Bugs Bunny famous, and 
Time, the magazine empire that owns Home Box Office and American Television 
&amp; Communications, the second largest U.S. cable system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TV Networks Should Worry 
</P>
<P>
But exciting as the vision is, it is also years away from being realized. And 
meanwhile, the Time-Warner combination -- if the merger is completed as planned 
-- will hold awesome power in today's media markets. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were the television networks, I'd worry," said analyst John Tinker of 
Morgan Stanley, as officials of CBS and NBC demanded that the government grant 
their companies the right to own cable systems and to own and syndicate 
programs. The networks fear the market power that Time Warner could exert as 
owner of a movie studio, a major exhibitor of movies (HBO) and cable systems 
with 5.5 million subscribers. The company would be a seller and a buyer of 
programming on a massive scale and could theoretically set differential prices 
to favor itself and hurt competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Network fears are understandable. Market power is something to be reckoned 
with, as Time Inc. demonstrated last year in the magazine field -- where it 
publishes Time, Life, Fortune, People, Money, Sports Illustrated and others. 
For years, the accepted wisdom in the advertising world was that independent 
magazines had nothing to fear from a multi-publication company like Time. 
Individual magazines have specific readerships and attract advertising on that 
basis, went the thinking. One didn't need to be a big company. 
</P>
<P>
Then Time showed the field what market power is all about. To discomfort 
competitors, Time offered advertisers who increased their ads in any Time 
publication a free ad in another of its magazines. The strategy boosted lagging 
ad page totals in Fortune and Sports Illustrated, and forced competitors to 
give advertisers a similar deal. It became an expensive year of giving away ad 
pages for Time's competitor, Newsweek, and Fortune's competitors, Forbes and 
Business Week. Time has since ended the practice, having shown the mailed fist 
and made its point. 
</P>
<P>
Could Time Warner bring the same kind of muscle to cable? Possibly, but it 
hasn't yet, even though Warner Communications has owned a studio and a cable 
system for years, just as Time has owned HBO and cable systems. That's one 
reason the Justice Department probably won't intervene on antitrust grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason is that increasing globalization may be making domestic 
antitrust rules beside the point. Traditionally, antitrust in the film industry 
has meant movie producers can't own theaters, a restriction that has eroded. 
The question for the future will be whether it makes sense to bar a U.S. 
company from owning a studio and a cable system if programs are distributed 
globally and restrictions don't apply to non-U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, such interesting questions are for the future. The thing to keep 
in mind about Time Warner is that people and institutions move less quickly 
than technology. Darryl Zanuck, who died in 1979, outlined his vision of 
instant global movies in 1962. But 27 years later the vision hasn't become 
reality. Time Warner, even presuming a competing offer doesn't derail the 
merger before it starts, could fall over its shoelaces in actually trying to 
operate as one company. 
</P>
<P>
Still, you don't have to see a vision realized to appreciate how smart it is, 
and how much it offers a glimpse of business in the global future.

MAXICARE WILL CLOSE BIG HMO IN ORANGE, LAYING OFF 500; 
</P>
<P>
TROUBLED HEALTH-CARE FIRM ENDING SERVICE TO 55,000 MEMBERS IN AN EFFORT TO 
REDUCE LOSSES 
</P>

Maxicare Health Plans Inc. said Tuesday that it is closing Family Health 
Services Inc., its 55,000-member health maintenance organization based in 
Orange, effective at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
FHS, which was acquired by Maxicare in 1986 when it bought HealthCare USA, 
operates 15 medical clinics under the FHS and General Med names in Los Angeles, 
Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange and San Diego counties. Maxicare said it is 
notifying members, employers and health-care providers of the planned closing 
so they can make alternative arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest impact of the closing will be in Orange County, where seven 
clinics operate under the General Med name. Of the 500 FHS employees to be laid 
off with the closing, about 300 work in Orange County, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Maxicare, which is in the midst of a financial restructuring 
that may be critical to its survival, said the closure of FHS is part of that 
broad program. The restructuring included selling unprofitable plans. However, 
the company said it is dismantling FHS because it could not sell the unit, 
despite nine months of intense effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked to a lot of people, but the deals were never consummated," said Tobi 
Nyberg, vice president for corporate communications. FHS has some assets, 
including buildings and medical equipment, that can be sold, but the Maxicare 
expects the net effect of the closure to be a loss, Nyberg said. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, Maxicare doesn't provide medical care directly but contracts 
with independent health-care providers for services. Since FHS is a 
self-contained unit providing services directly, its members won't 
automatically be covered by other Maxicare plans. Those members will have to 
enroll in other medical plans offered by their employers. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare said it is encouraging employers to hold special open enrollments so 
that FHS members will have access to alternative services immediately after 
March 31 when FHS' clinics stop seeing patients. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of FHS employees will remain for a few months to handle 
administrative tasks, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were concerned that Family Health Services' financial condition could 
affect its ability to deliver quality health care for its members," said Harley 
Blankenship, Maxicare's executive vice president and chief operating officer. 
The closure will also help Maxicare meet its goal "to cut debt and losses so we 
can pay provider claims on a timely basis," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which has suffered huge losses over the past two years, has said 
it must improve its payments schedule for contractors in order to preserve 
crucial relationships. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate announcement Tuesday, Maxicare said it changed financial advisers 
for the recapitalization plan. The company said it "concluded its agreement" 
with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., the New York investment banking firm hired last 
fall to help devise the plan, and instead hired Oppenheimer &amp; Co. for 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare's board authorized New York-based Oppenheimer to "immediately review 
strategic alternatives, including financing alternatives and additional asset 
sales," the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Blankenship wouldn't specify the reasons for changing advisers but said Goldman 
Sachs' departure was by "mutual agreement." Goldman Sachs declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Selwitz, an analyst with Cruttenden &amp; Co., a Newport Beach investment 
banking firm, said the change in advisers was a surprise. "I don't consider 
this kind of a deal a great sign. This is especially disturbing when you are 
talking about a situation where doing something expedient is really critical. 
This restructuring should have gone ahead before now." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect the recapitalization to involve converting its debt into 
equity. "The question is whether there is going to be a long haggling over how 
much equity for debt," Selwitz said. He said he was surprised that the company 
hasn't made an attempt to communicate with its senior creditors and 
bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
"To get this thing off and running, the company has to take the first step and 
go to the bondholders. This is a very critical step to the restructuring," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said in December that they expected to announce a plan in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
However, Blankenship said Tuesday that the recapitalization plan is on schedule 
and no further delays are expected as a result of changing advisers. "I would 
not be surprised if we may be in a position to make an announcement next week," 
although he said the company hasn't yet approached bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare needs to recapitalize because it can't meet interest payments due its 
bondholders and a group of banks holding about $150 million in debt. The banks 
have given Maxicare some "breathing room," Blankenship said, by agreeing to a 
120-day standstill agreement that allowed Maxicare to use funds to pay 
providers. When the agreement expires on April 1, he said, "we expect 
continuing our obligations to the banks."

GM Offers New Rebates: In an effort to boost its softening sales, General 
Motors began four new incentive programs, offering 4.9% short-term car loans on 
some top-selling models, such as the Corsica and Beretta. Analysts said the 
rebate programs would likely help improve March sales, which have lagged behind 
the strong pace of 1988. Ford and Chrysler also are offering 4.9% financing 
rates, but their programs are not as extensive. GM's inventory of unsold cars 
at the end of February was estimated at 85 days, while Ford's was 81 days and 
Chrysler's 94 days. The industry considers a 65- to 70-day supply of cars 
acceptable.

Pacific Enterprises OKs Holder Plan: The board of Pacific Enterprises, the Los 
Angeles-based parent of Southern California Gas Co. and Thrifty Corp., has 
adopted a shareholders' rights plan. The plan is intended to protect 
shareholders in the event of an unsolicited attempt to acquire Pacific 
Enterprises. "The plan was not adopted in response to any effort to acquire 
control of Pacific Enterprises and the board of directors is unaware of any 
such effort," Chairman Paul A. Miller said. "The plan is not intended to 
prevent a takeover of Pacific Enterprises and will not do so. However, it 
should discourage any attempt to acquire Pacific Enterprises in a manner or on 
terms not approved by the board of directors as being in the best interest of 
shareholders."

Britain Regains Optimism: Britain's leading business executives are regaining 
confidence in the economy despite government efforts to curb growth with high 
interest rates, a survey said. The Institute of Directors, which groups 37,000 
business leaders in Britain and overseas, said its members were increasingly 
optimistic about prospects for their own businesses and for the British economy 
as a whole. In February, 54% of directors in the survey were more optimistic 
about their companies' prospects than they were six months earlier, up from 47% 
in December.

Morita Proposes Task Force: Sony Corp. Chairman Akio Morita said he has 
proposed the creation of a joint task force to study the United States' 
$55-billion trade deficit with Japan and the growing dependence of U.S. 
companies on Japanese manufacturing technology. He said he had already taken 
his task force proposal to Japanese and U.S. officials, suggesting that they 
study the trade issue and come up with a plan of action. "We (Japan) are not a 
consumer supplier anymore," Morita said at a business conference. Morita said 
the trade gap is increasingly the result of America's dependence on Japanese 
manufacturing technology and could not be reduced only by pushing the dollar 
down in value against the Japanese yen.

TEXACO PLANS TO SLASH BUREAUCRACY; 
</P>
<P>
12 LAYERS OF OPERATIONS WILL GO, INCLUDING L.A. OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Texaco announced a plan Tuesday to streamline its legendary bureaucracy in the 
U.S. Oil Patch and said it would eliminate 12 of 26 layers of operations, 
including the Los Angeles office of 135 employes who oversee West Coast oil and 
gas exploration and production. 
</P>
<P>
The shuffle is expected to cut significantly into the overall employment of 
Texaco U.S.A., the Houston-based domestic operating arm of the company. A 
spokesman said much of the job reduction is expected to consist of early 
retirement or "voluntary" decisions not to accept transfers. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect wholesale layoffs," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Long derided in the oil industry as a company where nobody could make a 
decision, Texaco said a major reason for the cutback was to push authority down 
"as close to the wellhead as possible" and to introduce risk and participative 
management to the ranks. 
</P>
<P>
The plan divides its U.S. "upstream," or oil exploration and production, 
operations into East and West regions with 12 divisions. They supplant 26 
headquarter, division, region and district offices, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles division office in Universal City oversees exploration and 
production from California to Alaska. Its function moves to Denver, and the 135 
employes could be retired, laid off or transferred to Denver, Ventura or 
Bakersfield, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Unaffected by Tuesday's restructuring is the "downstream," or refining and 
retail end of Texaco's business. In California, that includes about 330 
employees in Universal City who will continue to oversee the company's Los 
Angeles refinery, West Coast service station network and other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Named to head the Denver-headquartered Western region was Vice President L. 
Paul Teague. His counterpart in New Orleans is Vice President William F. 
Wallace III. Both have similar responsibilities already. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco has been trimming its California operations since 1984, when the 
company's ill-fated takeover of Getty Oil Co. left it with more than 4,000 
employes in the state. It currently has about 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
The domestic reshuffling is the latest implementation of Texaco's companywide 
restructuring that stemmed from its bankruptcy in the aftermath of the Getty 
deal. The bankruptcy resulted from a $10.3-billion jury verdict that Texaco had 
improperly interfered with a Getty takeover by rival Pennzoil. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco is openly trying to reverse a highly centralized management style that 
was said to stifle employees and make it an unpopular and distrusted company 
within the industry. Oilmen accustomed to making deals on a handshake say 
Texaco management would routinely overrule such informal transactions. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to move the decision point as close to the wellhead as possible, 
so that each division operates as would a successful independent company, 
making its own operating decisions with minimum review at other management 
levels while being accountable for its own performance," said Texaco U.S.A. 
President James L. Dunlap. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Dunlap said the restructuring is to be completed by the end of 
the year. He said "some relocation and reduction of personnel is expected, but 
the final effect on employment cannot yet be determined."

The dollar rose against most major currencies except the Japanese yen in U.S. 
trading Tuesday after moving generally higher on markets abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices posted sharp gains. At 4 p.m. EST, Republic National Bank of New 
York quoted gold at $392.90 an ounce, up from Monday's late bid of $387.30. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Polce, a currency trader for Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said much of the 
dollar's movement was motivated by technical factors. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers bought dollars and sold West German marks after the West German central 
bank indicated that key interest rates will not be changed in the near future. 
In recent days, the mark had been driven higher periodically on speculation 
that West German interest rates might be going up. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound cost $1.7220 late Tuesday, cheaper for buyers than 
Monday's late $1.7250. Later in New York, sterling fetched $1.72155, down from 
$1.72335 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.03 Japanese yen, up from 127.63. In 
London late Tuesday the dollar traded lower at 128.80 yen. The dollar finished 
at 128.825 yen in New York, lower than Monday's late level of 129.15. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to Monday's late levels, 
included: 1.85525 West German marks, up from 1.85275; 1.5845 Swiss francs, down 
from 1.58575; 1.19825 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19235; 6.303 French francs, 
up from 6.29725, and 1,362.625 Italian lire, up from 1,362.125. 
</P>
<P>
Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared to late Monday's rates, 
included: 1.8520 West German marks, down from 1.8531; 1.5847 Swiss francs, up 
from 1.5830; 6.3000 French francs, up from 6.2955; 2.0945 Dutch guilders, up 
from 2.0855; 1,362.37 Italian lire, up from 1,359.25, and 1.1985 Canadian 
dollars, up from 1.1928. 
</P>
<P>
Gold bullion prices gained from $4 to more than $5 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery closed 
at $393.30 an ounce, $5.30 an ounce higher than Monday's close. 
</P>
<P>
The late gold bid price in London, the major European trading center, was 
$391.45 an ounce, up from $386.25 Monday.

2 BIG SOFTWARE FIRMS EXPECT PROFIT DROP; 
</P>
<P>
PRICES OF MICROSOFT, ASHTON-TATE STOCK FALL IN WAKE OF FORECASTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Microsoft Corp. and Ashton-Tate, two of the biggest publishers of personal 
computer software, Tuesday became the latest in the PC industry to report 
disappointing financial performances. 
</P>
<P>
The news from Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft stunned Wall Street, triggering a 
14% drop in the value of the company's stock as well as smaller declines among 
other technology issues. The most actively traded issue on the over-the-counter 
market, Microsoft stock closed at $53.50, off $8.50. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which publishes such business programs as Word and Excel as well 
as the popular Flight Simulator game, predicted that profits for the quarter 
ending March 31 would be "somewhat less" than the $37.3 million recorded a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft cited delays in shipping two new programs and mounting inventories of 
unsold products among key distributors. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company said sales would be in the $180-million to 
$200-million range, down from the $200 million to $215 million that analysts 
said Microsoft officials led them to expect earlier this year. Although that 
sales level would be up from $162 million a year earlier, the current quarter's 
performance marks a considerable slowing in the company's growth rate. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement renewed fears of broader problems ahead for the personal 
computer industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue at stake here is that there's slower growth ahead for personal 
computers," said James Weil, an analyst with the Gartner Group in Stamford, 
Conn. "The problem is that the industry hasn't realized it, and there have been 
over-optimistic sales projections." 
</P>
<P>
Ashton-Tate, the Torrance-based publisher of the popular dBase database 
management software program, said fourth-quarter profit was $13.4 million, up 
from $12.8 million from the year before but below analysts' forecasts of about 
$14 million. Revenue for the period was $87.3 million, also lower than most 
analysts expected but up from $75.5 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
For the full fiscal year ended Jan. 31, Ashton-Tate's profits were $47.7 
million, nearly 11% higher than the $43.1 million reported last year. Full-year 
revenues were $307.3 million, up 15%. 
</P>
<P>
In over-the-counter trading, Ashton-Tate shares dropped $1.50 to close at $21. 
</P>
<P>
The announcements from Microsoft and Ashton-Tate were the latest in a string of 
disappointing developments in the personal computer industry. 
</P>
<P>
Last month Apple Computer said its profits for the current quarter could lag 
last year's by as much as 45% due to slower sales of its top-of-the-line models 
and an oversupply of high-priced computer chips sitting in the company's 
warehouses. Late last year, several computer chip makers announced losses due 
to declining orders from personal computer manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these companies say that their problems are unique, but I don't 
believe that," said Bruce Lupatkin, a technology analyst with the San Frncisco 
investment firm of Hambrecht &amp; Quist. "All these issues are related to 
fundamental demand -- and demand is slowing." 
</P>
<P>
Lupatkin said he expects personal computer sales to slow to a growth rate of 
just 10% to 15% for 1989, down from a 30% growth rate in 1988 and a 40% rate in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft, which monopolizes the market for operating system software used by 
International Business Machines Corp. and IBM-compatible personal computers, 
said its problems should be resolved by June 30, the end of its fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Executives said two new versions of its word-processing program, Word, which 
were delayed due to errors in the software, should be ready for shipping next 
month and added that sales for the final quarter of the year should reflect the 
strong sales of the new products. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, President Jon Shirley said the overstocked distributors are 
reducing their inventories, a development that should lead to improved results 
in the final quarter.

SOME FDA OFFICIALS UNDER ETHICS PROBE; 
</P>
<P>
17 MAY HAVE TAKEN DRUG INDUSTRY GIFTS, HOUSE PANEL CHARGES

As many as 17 Food and Drug Administration officials may have violated 
government ethics rules by accepting subsidized hotel rooms to attend drug 
industry meetings at a luxury resort, congressional probers charged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the subsidy exceeded $200 per room per night, and some of the 
officials also charged drinks, limousines and gift-shop items to their rooms, 
said the investigators, who asked that they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
The tab for the subsidies and the other items was picked up by the National 
Assn. of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, an industry group that represents 
generic drug companies, the investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidies enabled the drug industry regulators to attend the group's annual 
conferences during the period 1986 to 1988 at a posh Dorado Beach, Puerto Rico, 
resort and not exceed their government expense allowances, the investigators 
and NAPM officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Government rules prohibit U.S. officials from accepting things of value from 
private groups, and they bar FDA officials in particular from taking gifts from 
firms they regulate. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the FDA and the NAPM said the FDA officials were unaware of the 
subsidies and stopped accepting them as soon as they learned of them earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used Cheaper Hotel 
</P>
<P>
But investigators for the House Energy and Commerce Committee's investigations 
subcommittee said they believed that at least some of the FDA officials "must 
have known" about the subsidies and stopped accepting them only after the 
investigators found out about the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
For this year's six-day meeting, which began Jan. 28, eight of the nine FDA 
employees who attended stayed at a cheaper hotel in San Juan, 40 miles away, 
NAPM executive director Robert Milanese said. The ninth stayed at the Dorado 
Beach facility but paid his own way, Milanese said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
"They made the decision," Milanese said of the FDA officials. "Apparently they 
have a very stringent policy on what might be seen as an indirect gratuity." 
</P>
<P>
This year, "we just told the association we would all be staying together in 
San Juan," FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the FDA officials had in the past paid $100 a night -- the 
maximum permitted under their government allowances -- for rooms that cost up 
to $330 a night. 
</P>
<P>
Grigg said the officials did not know the association was picking up the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Grigg and Milanese said the meetings were an important forum for federal 
regulators and industry officials to exchange views and information, and Grigg 
said no officials had been disciplined for accepting the room subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
At the subcommittee's request, the Inspector General of the Health and Human 
Services Department has been looking into the subsidies and the results of that 
probe are expected in the next two to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The probe is an offshoot of a federal grand jury and congressional 
investigation of alleged FDA favoritism in the approval of generic drugs, in 
which some drug companies are alleged to have received special treatment at the 
drug safety agency in return for bribes and other favors. 
</P>
<P>
Government sources said the criminal investigation, which is being heard by a 
federal grand jury in Baltimore, is expected to result in the indictment later 
this month of "several" FDA employees and as many as half a dozen generic drug 
firms, Reuters reported last week. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA's Grigg said he had no word of developments in the criminal probe. 
</P>
<P>
The investigations subcommittee, chaired by Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), kicked 
off the grand jury investigation after being tipped off by unidentified 
individuals to alleged criminal law violations at the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
Generic drug firms market their own copycat versions of well-known name-brand 
prescription drugs after the original makers' patent protection has expired. 
</P>
<P>
Before the drugs can be sold, they must go through a special FDA licensing 
procedure intended to speed them onto the market and promote drug industry 
price competition. 
</P>
<P>
Though the companies that are to be indicted are unknown, Par Pharmaceutical 
Inc. of Spring Valley, N.Y., disclosed in October that it, its Quad 
Pharmaceuticals subsidiary and a Quad executive were targets of the grand jury 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional investigators said American Therapeutics of Bohemia, N.Y., and 
its Chief Executive Raju Vegesna were subpoenaed last year by the 
investigations subcommittee and declined to testify, invoking their 
constitutional protection against self-incrimination. American Therapeutics 
lawyer David Weeda declined comment.

SHEA &amp; GOULD TO LEAVE L.A. OVER PROFIT DISPUTE

Shea &amp; Gould, an old-line New York-based law firm, confirmed Tuesday that 
it is shutting its Los Angeles branch office after 3 1/2 years because of 
dissension over the way profits were divided with the home office in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our partners were very unhappy," said Lessing E. Gold, managing 
partner of Shea &amp; Gould in Los Angeles. "The executive board (in New York) 
decided they should have a greater share of the profits." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 70 lawyers in the Los Angeles branch of New York-based Shea &amp; Gould, 
18 have already said they plan to leave the firm by the end of this month to 
open a Los Angeles office for Myerson &amp; Kuhn. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 52 lawyers will have four months to consider their options while 
the Los Angeles office of Shea &amp; Gould winds down its affairs, Gold said. 
</P>
<P>
"We really haven't decided whether we are going to make associations" with 
other firms, said Gold. "We are just going to phase out and consider the 
options." 
</P>
<P>
A last-ditch effort to work out the dispute failed last month when Gold and six 
other Los Angeles partners met with two executive committee members from New 
York. The lawyers from Los Angeles told their New York colleagues that they 
were unhappy they were not represented on the firm's executive committee and 
dissatisfied with the way profits were distributed. 
</P>
<P>
Shea &amp; Gould, which has a total of 380 lawyers, opened its Los Angeles 
office by acquiring the Los Angeles firm of Pacht, Ross, Warne, Bernhardt &amp; 
Sears.

DIAMOND GIANT DE BEERS' PROFIT DOUBLES 
</P>

<P>
South African diamond giant De Beers said Tuesday that its profit more than 
doubled last year as the gem market made a sparkling recovery from a five-year 
slump. 
</P>
<P>
De Beers Consolidated Mines, which controls about 80% of the world's diamonds, 
said after-tax profit jumped to $836 million (2.09 billion rand) in 1988 from 
$416 million (1.04 billion rand) the year before. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of factors combined to enable us to come out with this pleasing 
result," De Beers Chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"The results reflect both an increase in sales volumes and higher diamond 
prices, which were last raised in May, 1988." 
</P>
<P>
Pretax profit rose 88% to $1.15 billion (2.87 billion rand) and the company 
lifted its total dividend to 80 U.S. cents (200 South African cents) from 44 
U.S. cents (110 South African cents). 
</P>
<P>
The company's soaring profit followed a report in January by De Beers' 
London-based Central Selling Organization that sales of rough gems and 
industrial diamonds soared 36% to a record $4.17 billion in 1988, confirming a 
recovery in the diamond market since a deep slump that began in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect retail diamond sales to grow quite as well this year as in 
1988, but indications are that our main markets are continuing to expand," 
Ogilvie Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
De Beers was closely watching whether higher interest rates and the firm dollar 
would reduce sales, particularly in Japan which accounts for 22% of diamond 
jewelry sales. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some hesitation in Japan in the latter half of last year, but it's 
too early at this point to have firm figures for these markets," Ogilvie 
Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Stock market analysts said the earnings rise and marked increase in the 
dividend signaled De Beers' confidence that the extraordinary boom in the 
diamond market would continue, though probably at a slightly slower rate. 
</P>
<P>
"The broad picture seems that just about everything went well for them. The 
profit on the diamond account is restored to boom-time levels," said John 
Rogers, a partner at the Johannesburg stockbrokerage firm Edey, Rogers &amp; 
Co.

During the depression in the diamond business from 1981 to 1986, De Beers

rough uncut diamonds to dealers and jewelry manufacturers in Antwerp, Tel Aviv,

PEPSICO BACKS USE OF VIDEO IN AD CAMPAIGN

PepsiCo. said Tuesday that it stands behind its controversial Madonna 
advertising campaign. Despite the religious and sexual nature of the singer's 
new "Like a Prayer" video, from which portions of a much-publicized Pepsi 
commercial have been drawn, the firm said it has no plans to kill its ads or 
pull them from broadcasters airing the video. 
</P>
<P>
Tod MacKenzie, a Pepsi spokesman, disputed news reports that the company had 
pulled the ads from broadcast, saying that the response to the campaign "has 
been overwhelmingly positive." 
</P>
<P>
MacKenzie's statement followed two days of confusing and often conflicting 
reports regarding the Madonna video and commercial. 
</P>
<P>
The Reuters news agency had reported Monday that Pepsi was withdrawing the ad, 
and quoted Pepsi spokeswoman Becky Madeira as saying that the Madonna video 
"could be misinterpreted by a lot of people to be offensive" and that the 
company would "not advertise on any program that carries the . . . video." 
</P>
<P>
Those reports, which were widely reported by broadcasters and other newspapers, 
were incorrect, MacKenzie said, but he refused to comment further on the 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Pepsi officials met to discuss the Madonna situation on Tuesday 
and reaffirmed their support of her and the advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
MacKenzie said Madonna's flashy two-minute commercial, which debuted in the 
United States last Thursday during NBC's perennially top-rated "The Cosby 
Show," would be aired again, but that no dates had been officially scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial was shown in 40 countries during the opening day of the 
advertising campaign, Pepsi said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepsi spokesman also said the nature of the video in no way threatens the 
one-year endorsement deal between the soda company and Madonna -- reportedly 
secured to the tune of $5 million and including highly visible support of a 
world-wide concert tour that may begin in summer or fall. 
</P>
<P>
"This (deal) is a separate project (from Madonna's other singing and acting 
ventures)," MacKenzie said, stressing that Pepsi representatives had not seen 
the full video before the premiere of the commercial. "We would not presume to 
be involved with the rest of her career." 
</P>
<P>
A weekend wire service story said protests from a small Catholic organization 
in Italy prompted Italian state television network RAI and Madonna's Italian 
record company, WEA, not to air the video in Italy. But on Monday, Liz 
Rosenberg, a spokeswoman for Warner Bros. Records in the United States, said 
that was not the case and that the video had been shown to Italian broadcasters 
who found no reason not to air it. According to Rosenberg, the clip would begin 
airing in Italy within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, neither Warner Bros. nor MTV -- which has exclusive U.S. 
broadcast rights to the video for two weeks -- had received any calls 
protesting the video, and both said there were never any plans to cease 
broadcasts of the video. According to MTV spokeswoman Carol Robinson, the Pepsi 
ad (which uses non-controversial parts of the video) was not airing on MTV, but 
other Pepsi commercials were running as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Rev. Donald Wildmon, executive director of the Tupelo, 
Miss.-based American Family Association and one of the most vocal protesters 
against the movie "The Last Temptation of Christ," told The Times that he 
anticipated no organized protest against the video. 
</P>
<P>
"This (video) is only one little narrow piece of a big pie," said Wildmon, who 
had not seen the clip, but had read descriptions of its use of religious and 
sexual images. "I'm not saying it's not offensive. It is offensive. But we 
don't plan on making a crusade of it." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview printed in the current issue of Rolling Stone magazine, Madonna 
does not address the video itself, but discusses her feelings about religion 
and her Catholic upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she prays, the singer-actress said: "Constantly. I pray when I'm in 
trouble or when I'm happy. When I feel any sort of extreme. I pray when I feel 
so great that I'll think I need to check in with myself and recognize how good 
life is. I know that sounds silly. But when it seems there's so much bull 
around, it's important to just remind myself of the things I have to be 
grateful for. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, when I'm feeling really bad or sad, I pray to try to 
reassure myself. It's all kind of rationalization. I can't describe the way I 
pray. It has nothing to do with religion." 
</P>
<P>
She also said that she did not think she would raise any children she may have 
as Catholics, but still feels the faith to be an important part of her: 
</P>
<P>
"Once you're a Catholic, you're always a Catholic -- in terms of your feelings 
of guilt and remorse and whether you've sinned or not. Sometimes I'm wracked 
with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to me is left over from my Catholic 
upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner and you are a sinner 
all of your life. No matter how you try to get away from it, the sin is within 
you all the time."

<P>
Two lines in a Wednesday news report on the controversy surrounding pop singer 
Madonna's "Like a Prayer" video were inadvertently dropped from a paragraph, 
which resulted in an inaccurate statement from a PepsiCo spokesman that it had 
withdrawn its Madonna ads. The paragraph, which dealt with conflicting news 
reports about the soft drink company's support of the singer since the video's 
premiere last Friday, should have read that those reports were incorrect.

Al and Peg Bundy are no Ward and June Cleaver, no Cliff and Clair Huxtable. 
Sniping, bickering, belching anti-heroes, Al constantly grumbles that his wife 
of 16 years is the worst cook/maid/mother/lover ever to call herself a 
housewife, while Peg makes no secret that she considers her husband woefully 
inadequate as a provider, as a companion, as a man. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Al and Peg are one of the hottest couples on television -- the 
centerpiece of Fox Broadcasting's "Married . . . With Children," which has of 
late been beating two of the three major networks in the Sunday night ratings. 
In the last week, they have also become TV's most controversial duo, thanks to 
a Michigan woman's letter-writing campaign to advertisers protesting the 
couple's crude put-downs and innuendoes. 
</P>
<P>
What's all the fuss? 
</P>
<P>
In the last few months, "Married . . . With Children" has been screeching up 
the Nielsen charts. On Fox's ragtag collection of independent stations that 
reach fewer than 90% of the nation's households, the show now usually beats 
ABC's "Mission: Impossible" and NBC's "Day by Day" at 8:30 p.m. Sundays. For 
the past two weeks, the show actually has outdrawn all three networks in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"After 10 to 12 years of what I consider the more preachy situation comedies, 
people are ready to laugh again," said Michael Moye, co-creator and executive 
producer of the series. "They don't have to worry about a character on this 
sitcom having a heart attack or getting raped. They don't have to worry about 
learning anything. They can just sit back and laugh for 30 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
"People tell us all the time that they have a father or an uncle who is just 
like Al," said Katey Sagal, who plays Peg. "We all laugh at what we can relate 
to and the audience is seeing something that's familiar to them. Maybe that's 
why the show is catching on. Not everyone out there is young doctors and 
lawyers and two income families and therapy. That's not the norm. We're not all 
'thirtysomething.' " 
</P>
<P>
The people involved with "Married . . . With Children" drop names like "The 
Honeymooners" and "All in the Family" when describing the program, but they 
ultimately insist that there has never been anything like this sitcom that was 
designed to be anti-sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
Moye and his partner, Ron Leavitt, formerly writers for "The Jeffersons," 
"227," "Diff'rent Strokes" and "Laverne &amp; Shirley," created the series two 
years ago in rebellion against the onslaught of sweet family sitcoms that had 
come to dominate prime time. 
</P>
<P>
"We would just go wild," Moye said, "because people on these shows would be 
hugging and groping and saying 'I love you' to the dog, to the bird, to the 
house plants, to the kids, to the neighbors' kids. And we would just say, 'What 
has happened?' " 
</P>
<P>
"Married . . . With Children," the story of a disgruntled shoesalesman, his 
lascivious wife, two kids and a dog, premiered as part of Fox's first 
prime-time lineup in April, 1987. Its lower middle-class family setting is 
similar to ABC's more popular "Roseanne," which debuted last fall, but Moye 
insists that "Roseanne" is closer to "The Cosby Show" than his series, in that 
it always concludes with what he calls the inevitable episode-ending "group 
grope that infects" most network sitcoms today. 
</P>
<P>
"Married . . . With Children," on the other hand, regularly plunges off the 
deep end -- venturing into a kind of absurd family hell for jokes, put-downs 
and the kind of wacky, way-out-there satire reminiscent of some of the weirdest 
"Saturday Night Live" sketches. 
</P>
<P>
On one episode this season, the Bundys and their neighbors went off for a 
weekend in the woods. When Mom, daughter and friend all began menstruating at 
the same time, wild animals flocked to the cabin, trapping the humans inside. 
Undaunted, Al pasted spoons on his head for antlers in an effort to disguise 
himself as a moose and made a futile dash for the car. 
</P>
<P>
The Christmas episode featured a man dressed as Santa Claus crashing to his 
death in the Bundys' back yard after his parachute failed during a promotional 
stunt for the local shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
Another show had the luckless couple skipping out on an expensive dinner at a 
swanky restaurant by using one of Al's smelly shoes as a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Every episode is peppered with ribald talk about sex as Al and Peg constantly 
berate each other for their swelling waistlines and deteriorating libidos. Al 
is blatantly sexist, just as Archie Bunker was blatantly racist. And the 
Bundy's promiscuous 16-year-old daughter even refers to herself as a "slut" in 
front of her parents. 
</P>
<P>
Ed O'Neill, the actor who plays Al Bundy, defends the raffish jokes by saying 
that theirs is the one TV couple to deal honestly with their sexual 
relationship -- by not pretending that, after 16 years of marriage, they are 
still as "hot" for each other as on the day they wed. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, the show is so deliberately cartoonish that it is obviously 
not designed to be taken literally. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the never-ending barrage of tawdry jokes, Al's unabashed sexism and 
Peg's refusal to cook, clean, work or do anything other than watch "Oprah" and 
badger Al into bed with her, that has incurred the wrath of Terry Rakolta, a 
Michigan housewife and mother of four, who has denounced the series as 
"offensive, (filled with) gratuitous sex and anti-family." Last week, Rakolta 
made national news after she had persuaded one advertiser to pull a commercial 
from the program and two others to announce they would not buy time on the show 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Fox officials have apologized publicly for one episode in which a young woman 
trying on underwear in a lingerie shop removes her bra while the camera shoots 
her from behind. But, pointing to other programs such as "Eye on L.A." and the 
sexual bondage scene in NBC's miniseries "Favorite Son," Fox executives insist 
that the typical "Married . . . With Children" episode is tamer than what is 
commonplace on television today. And they vowed not to alter the program's 
usual content. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to remain within the boundaries of good taste as defined by our 
viewers," said Kevin Wendle, executive vice president of Fox Entertainment. "We 
do not want to plant a flag beyond where the flag has already been planted by 
other networks. (Rakolta) is entitled to her opinions, but I think this show is 
fine for the 8:30 p.m. time period." 
</P>
<P>
The show's producers and executives at Columbia, which makes the show for Fox, 
declined to comment on Rakolta's attack, but in an interview the day before her 
denunciation became public, actor O'Neill acknowledged that the show's brand of 
humor might not appeal to everyone. If that's the case, they simply shouldn't 
watch, he said. But he rejected the suggestion that his character should be 
expected to project a positive image. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing I think Al should be is a role model," O'Neill said. "Were 
Laurel and Hardy role models? Is Elmer Fudd a role model? These characters are 
just supposed to make people laugh, not teach or enlighten anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought that comedy is basically mean-spirited. You don't have 
anything happy and sweet that's very funny. Jackie Gleason, the Marx Brothers, 
the Three Stooges, all that stuff was based on something bad happening to 
somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
"These are jokes and people watch simply because they think it's funny," agreed 
Sagal, who argued that Peg Bundy is blessed with a healthy dose of self-esteem, 
has a "gas" of a time no matter what and therefore is not a bad model for 
anyone. "We're not tapping into some sadistic undertone out there." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, O'Neill, Sagal and executive producer Moye joke that too much "sweet 
and nice" like they see on most sitcoms puts too much pressure on people. Moye 
said he has actually seen couples get into a fight while watching the typical 
network sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
"The wife will say, 'Why can't you be more like him? See, he brings her flowers 
every day,' " Moye said. "And he'll say, 'well she cooks him a meal every day.' 
They actually will start arguing. Occasionally, I think people want to watch a 
family that's a little worse off than they are so they can sit back and say, 
'Honey, at least we're not like that.' " So if we're here to do any public 
service, we're putting back together some marriages that those other shows are 
breaking apart."

'PROTECT CHILDREN ACT' AIMS TO BAN CIGARETTE DEALS IN FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Legislation has been introduced in Congress to ban youth-oriented cigarette 
advertising, including payments to film makers to feature specific cigarette 
brands in their movies. 
</P>
<P>
Paid "product placement" deals, calling for brand-name merchandise to be shown 
in films, are a legal and potentially large source of revenue for movie 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
But paying to have cigarettes placed in movies is "a subtle technique by the 
merchants of addiction to get young people to smoke," Rep. Tom Luken (D-Ohio) 
said in introducing the bill last week. The proposed legislation is being 
co-sponsored by Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) and Bob Whittaker (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
Luken also said paid 
</P>
<P>
placement of cigarettes in films "has the effect of circumventing the federal 
ban on cigarette advertising on television" when movies appear on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Tobacco companies say they shy away from product placement deals precisely to 
avoid charges like the one Luken made. 
</P>
<P>
But in filing the bill last week, Luken, who chairs the House transportation 
and hazardous materials subcommittee, said a preliminary inquiry has turned up 
three instances in which cigarette makers did pay to feature their brands in 
recent films. 
</P>
<P>
In response to questions from Luken, Liggett Group Inc. said in a letter that 
it paid $30,000 in 1983 to have its Eve cigarette brand appear in the movie 
"Supergirl" -- although the company's policy since has been to "not pay for 
product to be used in films." 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris Cos., the No. 1 U.S. tobacco company and maker of the Marlboro 
brand that is the world's largest seller, disclosed two cases in which payments 
were made to feature cigarettes in foreign-made films destined for United 
States and foreign audiences. In a Feb. 24 letter, the company said these were 
the only cases it had discovered "based upon our review thus far." 
</P>
<P>
In the first case, more than $40,000 was paid in 1979 for Marlboro to appear in 
"Superman II." And the company's Tokyo-based advertising agency agreed last 
fall to pay $350,000 to showcase Lark cigarettes in "License Revoked," a new 
James Bond film shot primarily in Mexico. Lark is actually a Liggett brand, but 
Philip Morris owns the rights to the brand overseas, including in Japan, where 
the James Bond character is especially popular. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Philip Morris said, it has been providing free cigarettes 
or advertising signs for an average of 17 films per year, but without paying 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a Philip Morris spokesman told The Times that the company 
had not paid to place its cigarettes in movies "for at least 10 years," but 
said he was not sure this applied to all foreign subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the No. 2 cigarette maker, told Luken it does not 
pay film makers to feature its brands, a policy "we believe . . . has been 
adhered to" at least since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Devaney, director of product placement at Rogers &amp; Cowan Inc., a 
public relations firm, said Reynolds "is the one account that I don't pursue 
any placements for." He said that when film makers request cigarettes for 
movies rated "R" or "PG-13," "I give them product and that's it. . . . If they 
come to me and they want my brand, I'm certainly going to say OK." 
</P>
<P>
The issue is a sensitive one for the cigarette makers, who were helped in 
decades past by a flood of endorsements from glamorous stars. The companies say 
they do not target adolescents through movies or other media, and that they 
advertise only to lure smokers of other brands -- not to induce non-smokers to 
start. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have long accused the companies of using popular entertainment to 
market their brands to youth. With nearly all new smokers taking up the habit 
while still in their teens, critics say the cigarette makers must target youth 
to replace the 2 million smokers who annually quit or die. 
</P>
<P>
An aide said Luken will press the cigarette companies for more specifics on 
their product placement policies. For example, some firms that said they 
currently do not pay to get their brands in movies did not provide information 
back to 1979, as Luken requested. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation to ban all forms of cigarette advertising and promotion went 
nowhere in the last session of Congress. The Luken bill, dubbed "The Protect 
Our Children From Cigarettes Act of 1989," takes a less sweeping approach. It 
would permit text-only advertising on billboards and in print media, with no 
pictures other than the cigarette pack. However, cigarette billboards would be 
banned from sports arenas, vending machine sales would be barred in places 
accessible to adolescents and payments to feature cigarettes in movies would be 
banned. 
</P>
<P>
Luken said he was not trying "to restrict in any way an artistic decision to 
have a smoking scene in a movie." But he said that decision "should not be 
influenced by the lure of large cash payments." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, declined 
comment, saying through a spokeswoman he was studying the bill.

VIDEO REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Madonna is frequently in the tabloids. Stigmata sightings are frequently in the 
tabloids. So the purportedly shocking imagery of the pop singer's controversial 
new video clip "Like a Prayer" could be Weekly World News' dream come true: 
Madonna Bears Stigmata. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to early reports, however, Madonna does not make love to a Christ 
figure in thevideo. Wrong dream sequence. (Where was she when Marty Scorsese 
needed her?) 
</P>
<P>
Whatever is or isn't in this highly stylized clip -- which is currently airing 
exclusively on MTV -- the key question in the wake of the uproars over "The 
Last Temptation of Christ" and "The Satanic Verses" will no doubt be: Is the 
video blasphemous? 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't even come close. It's a secular love song that has no more to do 
with religion than "Like a Virgin" had to do with virginity. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the imagery in the video isn't very much designed to be provocative 
and irreverent. 
</P>
<P>
So far as it's possible to tell amid all the symbolism and jump-editing, the 
racism-related story line goes something like this: Clad in revealing lingerie, 
Madonna enters an empty church where she is drawn to a statue of a young black 
man robed in white -- a saint or a martyr, perhaps? -- behind bars. She lies 
down on a pew and is apparently overcome by a vision, while the statue comes to 
life. 
</P>
<P>
In this vision, the scenario of a recent crime is unveiled before her: A group 
of white thugs attacks and stabs a white woman, but a black man who comes to 
her aid is arrested. Madonna is then awakened from her vision by a raucous 
black choir marching through the church. She trots down to the local jail, 
where she vouches for the jailed man's innocence before the police -- who 
presumably believe the fever dream of a woman who is standing at the sergeant's 
desk wearing only a brassiere and a slip. 
</P>
<P>
That's the story line, but there's more -- much more -- that could conceivably 
shock or offend. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna sings in front of a field of burning crosses. Madonna handles the 
murder weapon, a knife, and suddenly is supernaturally afflicted with bleeding 
nail wounds in her palms. Madonna does an uninhibited, giddy little dance with 
a gospel troupe, and at one point gets down on her knees while a choir member 
puts a hand on Madonna's forehead, faith healer-style. Rather than fall 
backward from the healing touch, Madonna appears as if she might be about to 
fall out of her bra. 
</P>
<P>
Are the protesters lined up yet? 
</P>
<P>
Madonna would no doubt argue that her detractors exaggerate the video's sexual 
content, which is minimal if you don't count immodesty of dress. 
</P>
<P>
She wants to show that she can amply display her hourglass figure and still be 
a complete innocent, guiltlessly joining a choir in a place of worship at the 
happy finale with a childlike glee. Indeed, she even dances with a little boy 
-- a scene reminiscent of her superior video a few years back for "Open Your 
Heart," in which, playing a stripper, she danced off into the sunset with a 
young boy.

For video aficionados, "Like a Prayer" is heartening for its bold use of a 
narrative approach -- something seen less and less of late. At its best, the 
conceptual pop video can serve as a resurrection of the silent film, telling 
stories without dialogue, as here. 
</P>
<P>
But how clever is the story being told? At its core, "Like a Prayer" is a 
rather basic redemptive tale, one perhaps bogged down more than buoyed by its 
weighty and often gratuitous symbolism. It's an attention-grabber with some 
nice cinematic touches, but the only viewers it's likely to truly move are 
those whose hands reflexively jerk toward phones or picket signs at the 
slightest provocation. 
</P>
<P>
Which may be part of the idea.

STABBED TEACHER'S PLAN TO GET TOUGH TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The Olive Vista Junior High School teacher who was stabbed by one of her 
students Monday had decided just weeks ago to "crack down" this semester on 
students misbehaving in her English classes, colleagues said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Edwards required high standards of work and behavior in her students, 
history teacher Fay Denzler said. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards is recovering from her wound at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission 
Hills. Hospital officials would not allow her to be interviewed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"She was stricter and gave out more work than I think the students here were 
used to," said Denzler, who has taught at the Sylmar school for 20 years. 
"She'd told me about two or three weeks ago that she was going to start 
reporting little incidents, instead of letting them go." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, 37, was writing a misconduct report on a boy shortly after lunch when 
she was attacked from behind, school authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Custody 
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old ninth-grader, whose name has been withheld because of his age, 
was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and is being held at Sylmar 
Juvenile Hall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, district officials said the school has been temporarily assigned an 
extra police officer, in addition to the one already there. School board 
President Roberta Weintraub, who represents the eastern San Fernando Valley, 
said that schools in her area for months have been "desperate" for more school 
police officers and aides. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't have the money," Weintraub said. 
</P>
<P>
The district has 302 sworn police officers. Of these, 143 are assigned to 
schools. They dress in plainclothes and carry firearms and Mace. All but 22 of 
the district's 73 junior highs have a full-time officer assigned to campus. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Pilloud, a social studies teacher who has a class next door, said he rushed 
to Edwards' room after students called for help and found her slumped over a 
table writing out the telephone numbers of her brother and sister to notify 
them of her plight. Next to her was the misconduct slip that she had begun 
filling out when she was attacked, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked her if she was all right and she said, 'No, I'm not,' " Pilloud said. 
"That's when I saw the handle of the knife sticking out of her back." 
</P>
<P>
Pilloud and others said Edwards is well-liked by students and colleagues, 
despite her strict classroom discipline. A 20-year employee of the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, Edwards started teaching at Olive Vista in September. 
She had transferred there from Robert Louis Stevenson Junior High School in 
East Los Angeles to be closer to her home in Palmdale, Principal Charles Welsh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Edwards didn't put up with any foolishness," Welsh said. "When you walked 
into her classroom, you knew who was in charge: Miss Edwards." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minor Offenses 
</P>
<P>
Teachers at the school who know the boy arrested in the attack said he was a 
happy-go-lucky, C student, who regularly got into trouble for minor offenses, 
such as talking out of turn and not completing homework. 
</P>
<P>
The boy had transferred to Olive Vista from San Fernando Junior High School in 
May, 1987, because of behavior problems, Welsh said. He had been in Edwards' 
class only since February. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an attention-getter; somebody who wanted to be the life of the party," 
said Linda Ibach, who taught the boy last year in her remedial reading class. 
"He has the most beautiful smile you can imagine." 
</P>
<P>
Ibach said that although the boy was a discipline problem in class, he never 
threatened anybody with violence. The boy's school counselor, Linda Brigs, said 
he had been referred to her a few times for minor conduct problems, such as 
talking back to teachers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Surprised' 
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised and shocked," Brigs said. "He is a very likable guy." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers said in lunchroom interviews that they are not fearful of students at 
the Olive View campus.

VA WILL REISSUE 3,200 LOST CHECKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Veterans Administration on Tuesday ordered reissuance of about 3,200 
pension and benefit checks that apparently failed to reach veterans in several 
areas of Los Angeles, a spokesman for the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Sawchek, VA regional public affairs director, said the problem affected 
recipients in 13 Zip Code areas. Although the March 1 checks were issued by the 
VA's disbursing office in Austin, Tex., postal authorities said they did not 
receive them for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Sawchek said complaint calls indicated that the problem did not extend to those 
checks mailed to banks for direct deposit to veterans' accounts. 
</P>
<P>
He said regional veterans' benefits director James Maye ordered duplicate 
checks issued for all home-delivery recipients in the 13 Zip Code areas, even 
though many of those beneficiaries may not have complained. 
</P>
<P>
He advised anyone who receives a second check not to cash it. 
</P>
<P>
"Irrespective of who's to blame," said Sawchek, "we decided to go ahead and 
solve the problem." In the meantime, the VA and postal authorities were trying 
to determine what happened to the original checks. 
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it might take 8 to 10 days for a replacement check to arrive.

SUSPECT ACQUITTED IN OFFICER'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man accused of helping plan the 1985 revenge slaying of a Los Angeles police 
detective was acquitted Tuesday of first-degree murder but still faces a 
conspiracy charge. 
</P>
<P>
A Van Nuys Superior Court jury acquitted Reecy Clem Cooper, 34, of one count of 
murder in the killing of Detective Thomas C. Williams, gunned down as he was 
picking up his young son at a Canoga Park day-care center. Cooper still faces a 
charge that he conspired with four other men in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the second charge, Cooper could receive a maximum sentence of 
25 years to life in prison, said Deputy Dist. Atty. E. William Gravlin, a 
prosecutor in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Three other men have already been convicted of charges connected to the 
slaying.

SUPERVISORS REJECT SALES TAX INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A divided Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors rejected a proposal Tuesday 
asking voters to support a half-cent increase in the county sales tax that 
would have raised money for mental health and emergency health care, the 
homeless and AIDS-related programs. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who successfully pushed for a similar half-cent sales 
tax for mass transit nearly 10 years ago, failed to win board support for his 
latest proposal to raise $400 million annually for such county programs. 
</P>
<P>
Only board Chairman Ed Edelman joined Hahn in backing the measure, which would 
have been placed before county voters on the June, 1990, ballot. But the 
board's conservative majority -- Supervisors Mike Antonovich, Deane Dana and 
Pete Schabarum -- opposed the idea, claiming in part that the public is already 
overtaxed. 
</P>
<P>
But the supervisors agreed to explore other possible funding sources.

MEASURE TO EVICT DRUG DEALERS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors passed an ordinance Tuesday empowering law 
enforcement officials to evict tenants who use their homes to sell drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Antonovich, who introduced the measure, which passed without opposition, 
called the law "a new and valuable weapon in our war on drug dealers." 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which took effect immediately, empowers the district attorney's 
office and Sheriff's Department to initiate eviction proceedings against people 
who sell drugs from rented homes or apartments. Failure by the landlord to 
follow up on the county's orders could mean fines of up to $5,000.

CARE HOME OPERATORS ARE CHARGED WITH 40 HEALTH, SAFETY OFFENSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The operators of several South-Central Los Angeles board and care homes were 
charged Tuesday by the city attorney's office with numerous criminal health and 
safety violations -- some of them "potentially life-threatening." 
</P>
<P>
The 40-count complaint against John Hunt Jr., 51, and two others involves a 
complex of six homes housing about 90 residents in and around the 12400 block 
of South Vermont Avenue. Five of the six were operating without a state 
license, City Atty. James K. Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
Charged with 29 of the same counts was Hunt's wife, Georgia Beasley Hunt, 70. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employee Charged 
</P>
<P>
Employee Brenda K. Simpson-Wilson, 38, was named in three counts involving 
alleged illegal possession of controlled substances that had not been 
prescribed by a physician. These were identified as Flurazepan and 
phenobarbitol. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt, who operates 15 South Los Angeles facilities housing more than 240 
people, has declared in the past that he is a formerly homeless person trying 
to help solve the problems of people with no place to live. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Hunt has a heart as big as this city," Simpson-Wilson said of him in an 
interview several months ago." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors, however, complained that Hunt's Board and Care is a profit-seeking 
business in which he buys private homes and converts them into run-down 
boarding houses that cause blight and bring crime and drugs into the area. 
</P>
<P>
"His business totally changed the well-being and safety of an entire 
community," said one unhappy woman neighbor in November. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surprise Inspections 
</P>
<P>
It was about that time -- Nov. 10 -- that members of a joint city, county and 
state task force coordinated by Deputy City Atty. Fay Chu made a series of 
surprise inspections at the six Vermont Avenue houses. 
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint, the investigators found that the facilities did not 
have the required smoke detectors, had illegally installed security bars over 
windows without quick-release devices, had faulty electrical outlets and broken 
windows. The homes also provided inadequate food and failed to keep proper 
medication records, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
State welfare and city building and safety inspectors, said Hahn, "found myriad 
problems at the six locations, including some that could be potentially 
life-threatening and others that amounted to slum conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt said he had not seen the complaint and did not know what the city attorney 
was talking about. "The last time they were out here," he said, "we were in 
compliance. We did everything they asked us to do. The health department came 
and the Fire Department. . . . We did not ignore any orders." 
</P>
<P>
The surprise inspections were the climax of a criminal investigation launched 
in August after county welfare officials reported that five of the board and 
care homes were being operated without licenses, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
Social Security investigators reported that John Hunt is the payee on "a 
number" of Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) checks being 
received by residents of his facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Chu said that Hunt once had a state Department of Corrections contract to house 
at 12430 S. Vermont Ave. up to 25 parolees and persons released from prison 
after having served their sentences. But, Chu said, corrections officials 
trying to find some of the parolees found them living at other Hunt houses and 
canceled the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said the house at 12430 S. Vermont, Hunt's headquarters, "has a history of 
problems." He noted that city Fire Department records showed 16 fire calls 
there during the first seven months of last year. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-count criminal complaint listed 24 Los Angeles Municipal Code violations 
as well as 10 violations of the state Health and Safety Code and six state 
Public Health Code violations. Each of the 40 violations is punishable by up to 
six months in jail and/or a $1,000 fine.

PROBE OF HOUSING DIRECTOR'S CONTRACT PRACTICES ORDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR and GLENN F. BUNTING, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An investigation into alleged improper contracting practices by Leila 
Gonzalez-Correa, the executive director of the city Housing Authority, was 
ordered Tuesday by the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
On a 12-0 vote, the council directed three city agencies to investigate whether 
Gonzalez-Correa violated federal regulations on at least five occasions by 
awarding more than $200,000 in contracts to her acquaintances and to political 
supporters of Mayor Tom Bradley without seeking other bids. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez-Correa, in her first public statement since the contracting practices 
were disclosed by The Times last month, charged in a letter to council members 
Tuesday that the city attorney's office had signed off on the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"There was explicit concurrence by the Board of (Housing) Commissioners and the 
city attorney in most of the instances of procurement cited in the press," 
wrote Gonzalez-Correa. 
</P>
<P>
Records show, however, that in most instances the city attorney's office was 
unaware that Gonzalez-Correa had issued the contracts. The city's investigation 
was assigned to Chief Legislative Analyst William McCarley, City Administrative 
Officer Keith Comrie and City Controller Rick Tuttle. 
</P>
<P>
Findings of the inquiry, to be completed within 30 days, will be reported to 
the council's Grants, Housing and Community Development Committee chaired by 
Councilman Robert Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
The probe is expected to focus solely on five contracts that have been 
questioned, Comrie said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Probe May Widen 
</P>
<P>
While he left the door open for the panel to investigate "anything else that 
comes up," Comrie said the city is relying on the U.S. Department of Housing 
and Urban Development to conduct a thorough examination of the city housing 
agency's spending practices and procedures. "They will look at the entire 
operation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On a motion by Councilman Nate Holden, who is running for mayor, the council 
had initially considered ordering the city attorney to conduct the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
But as the vote approached the floor Tuesday, council members agreed that the 
city attorney may have a conflict of interest, because the office serves as the 
Housing Authority's legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
The three city agencies -- which lack formal investigative powers and do not 
regularly monitor the housing agency's practices -- are expected to do "a quick 
look-see," said one city official, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, it looks like it is going to be swept under the rug," the city 
official said. "It's what the mayor wants . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Still, John Emerson, executive assistant to the city attorney, agreed that his 
office should not be involved in the investigation. He said the three other 
agencies were better equipped to conduct "what is essentially an operational 
audit." And, he added, because there are questions concerning advice given 
Gonzalez-Correa by the city attorney's office, it is better to have a "more 
neutral" agency conduct the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez-Correa, whose $100,000-a-year contract expires in October, continues 
to receive the support of Bradley, despite recent criticism of her spending 
practices and a controversial plan to sell the dilapidated Jordan Downs public 
housing project. 
</P>
<P>
In the memo sent to council members on Monday, Gonzalez-Correa said her 
procurement activities were approved by the Housing Authority Board of 
Commissioners and the city attorney's office in four of five contracts 
exceeding $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gonzalez-Correa failed to notify board members or the city attorney of 
contracts in two of the four cases, Housing Authority records show. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, Gonzalez-Correa said she received board approval to pay $46,000 in 
consulting fees to an acquaintance from Texas, Joe Rocha. But she neglected to 
report that Rocha had received an additional $25,735 without competitive bids 
and without board approval, and he was paid $16,450 after the board had 
instructed Gonzalez-Correa to stop using Rocha's services. 
</P>
<P>
In calling for the inquiry, Holden said he wanted to "restore some integrity" 
to the Housing Authority. But, he added in an interview, "We don't want to 
indict anyone before we get the facts."

JURY HEARS 2 1/2-HOUR ROSTON TAPE MADE HOURS AFTER WIFE VANISHED FROM SHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hours after his new bride tumbled overboard to her death from their honeymoon 
cruise ship, Scott Roston told the ship's physician that his wife had insisted 
they get married and had told him that "God must love her to make her so happy, 
to bring us together." 
</P>
<P>
"She just said that . . . it scares her sometimes how happy she's been with me 
and with us getting married, you know," Roston said. His tape-recorded voice 
sounded flat and tired during most of the interview that Dr. Wesley K.W. Young 
conducted while Coast Guard ships were still combing the waters south of San 
Diego for a sign of 26-year-old Karen Roston. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sat in Silence 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica chiropractor, on trial in Los Angeles federal court on charges 
of strangling his wife and hurling her unconscious body off the ship Feb. 13, 
1988, sat silently most of the time that the 2 1/2-hour tape was played to the 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Roston said the couple made love "once or twice a day" and 
took long walks together throughout the weeklong cruise to Mexico. Karen, he 
said, loved life and never would have deliberately jumped overboard. 
</P>
<P>
"She likes to roller-skate, swim. She wanted me to teach her how to play golf 
and how to snow-ski. She likes to do aerobics. She loves music and dancing. And 
she loves me," he told ship's physician Young. Roston began weeping quietly 
when he heard that segment of the tape. 
</P>
<P>
Young testified Tuesday that he had examined Karen Roston a few days before her 
death when she claimed she had tripped and bumped her head. She had complained 
of some temporary dizziness, but Young said he found no sign of injury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mood Was 'Odd' 
</P>
<P>
"Karen actually didn't want to be there. Her husband felt very strongly about 
her being there to be examined. She was almost apologetic," Young testified. 
</P>
<P>
After she disappeared, Young said he interviewed Roston to try to piece 
together what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"His mood, I thought, was odd," the doctor said. "I would have expected 
somebody who had lost their wife to be a lot more agitated and excited, and he 
seemed a lot more calm." 
</P>
<P>
Roston, 37, did not reveal any hint of his claim now that Israeli agents, 
retaliating against him for a book he wrote about Israeli human rights abuses, 
seized him, drugged him into unconsciousness and attacked his wife. Roston says 
he was afraid to reveal the truth then because the Israeli agents were still on 
the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the interview, Roston insisted that Karen had been walking laps 
around the ship's jogging track in a stiff wind while he waited at one end of 
the deck. Suddenly, he said, he heard his wife scream for help. 
</P>
<P>
Roston said he ran to where the screams were coming from and saw his wife on

"I saw her trying to pull herself up on the outside of the railing and she was 
reaching up, and she lost her grip and she fell down and she was holding on to 
the edge and I was, tried to reach through to get her and I hit my face on 
something and, and . . . I tried, I tried to reach for her, but then she wasn't 
there anymore," he said.

<P>
Roston said he must have gotten the scrapes and scratches the doctor found on 
his face when he hit it as he reached for Karen. But the doctor found other 
scapes on his arm, shoulder, chest and abdomen that Roston said he might have 
gotten while making love or while trying to help his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly during the interview, Roston asked ship officials if they had found 
his wife and said at one point that he had to go lay out her clothes for her 
return. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll find her," he said. "God gave her to me. He's not going to take her 
away now."

A headline in the Metro section on Feb. 16 read: "Gates Reprimands Aide for 
Using LAPD Files for Political Research." As noted in the story, the "files" 
were not actual police files, but were newspaper articles and other publicly 
available documents stored in a commonly used computer data base. The material 
was retrieved for Assistant Chief Robert L. Vernon via a computer at police 
headquarters.

The Assembly's fiscal committee today sent to the Assembly floor a bill that 
would ban manufacture and sale of about four dozen models of semi-automatic 
assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The Ways and Means Committee voted 14 to 3 for AB357 by Assemblyman Mike Roos 
(D-Los Angeles). All the yes votes were cast by Democrats and all the noes by 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would ban the manufacture, importation, sale or possession of a list 
of specified assault pistols, rifles and shotguns. It would allow people who 
possess the guns at present to keep them by getting state permits. One of the 
banned weapons would be the AK-47, the type of semi-automatic assault rifle 
used by Patrick Purdy in killing five children and wounding 28 children and a 
teacher in a Stockton schoolyard on Jan. 17.

3 MEN ARRESTED IN SAN CLEMENTE AFTER 70-MILE HIGHWAY PURSUIT

<P>
Three suspects who led police on a 70-mile highway chase through two counties 
were turned over to the Immigration and Naturalization Service today after they 
were captured in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
The three suspects, riding in a car that police said had been stolen Tuesday in 
Chula Vista, were identified as undocumented aliens from Mexico, according to 
the California Highway Patrol. Rodolfo Lopez, 19, who was driving a 1982 silver 
Toyota Tercel, stopped near the Avenida Pico exit off southbound Interstate 5, 
jumped out of the car and ran across the freeway heading east along Avenida 
Pico, CHP Sgt. Mike Johnson said. Lopez was tracked by a police helicopter 
involved in the pursuit and was caught about five minutes later in a brushy 
area, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know why he stopped, the car was still running," Johnson said. "Maybe 
he just figured it was a good place to get out and run." 
</P>
<P>
Passengers Jorge Sandoval, 26, and Adan Torres, 19, were taken into custody 
from the car at 5:55 a.m., 45 minutes after the chase began at 7th and Mateo 
streets in downtown Los Angeles. Los Angeles police began the chase at speeds 
exceeding 90 m.p.h., with CHP officers taking over when the vehicle entered 
Orange County.

COUNTY AGENCY WEIGHS GO-AHEAD ON S.F. VALLEY RAIL ROUTE STUDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission is meeting today to decide 
which San Fernando Valley rail routes to study amid warnings that changes in 
the options under consideration could force postponement of a Valley line until 
the next century. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-member commission is scheduled to vote whether to authorize the final 
phase of a state-mandated $2.1-million engineering and environmental study of 
cross-Valley route options. 
</P>
<P>
The study results, expected no sooner than January, are to serve as the basis 
for designating a route and determining whether the system should be light rail 
or an extension of the Metro Rail subway system. The commission has about $800 
million available to build one more rail system over the next 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
However, environmental studies on two competing light-rail projects -- 
downtown-to-Pasadena and Marina del Rey to the western terminus of the Century 
Freeway -- are nearly completed and commissioners predict that officials from 
those areas will soon begin lobbying for the available funds. 
</P>
<P>
Valley routes under consideration are the Ventura Freeway right-of-way from the 
planned Universal City Metro Rail station to Warner Center and a Southern 
Pacific railroad freight right-of-way that parallels Chandler and Victory 
boulevards between Metro Rail's northern terminus on Lankershim Boulevard in 
North Hollywood and Warner Center.

NORTH WILLING TO LIE TO CONGRESS: WITNESS; 
</P>
<P>
SAYS HE HEARD HIM MAKE STATEMENT TO NELSON B. HUNT

Oliver L. North told Nelson Bunker Hunt "I don't care if I have to go to jail. 
. . . I don't care if I have to lie to Congress," a conservative fund-raiser 
for the Contras testified today. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Channell said he overheard North make the comment to Hunt at the close of 
a meeting at the Petroleum Club in Dallas on Sept. 11, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Channell had arranged to make a plane available for North to fly down from 
Washington so that the White House aide could describe the Contras' military 
needs to Hunt, a wealthy Texas businessman. 
</P>
<P>
North talked to Hunt about $5-million to $6-million worth of items the Contras 
needed "to stay alive," Channell recalled, including planes, two types of 
ammunition, clothing, food and medical supplies. After dinner, as they prepared 
to leave the club, Channell listened as North and Hunt discussed Central 
American politics. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt asked North whether he was worried about "getting in trouble," Channell 
recalled. "Ollie said 'No, I don't care if I have to go to jail for this. I 
don't care if I have to lie to Congress about this,' " Channel testified. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt just "chortled," Channell recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt eventually contributed $237,500 to Channell's tax-exempt National 
Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty and also made a $237,500 loan to the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Channell pleaded guilty on April 29, 1987, to depriving the government of tax 
revenue by using NEPL to solicit contributions for military equipment for the 
Contras. 
</P>
<P>
One of the 12 criminal charges against North is that he conspired to defraud 
the Treasury of tax revenue. Six of the charges accuse North of making false 
statements and obstructing Congress by attempting to hide his efforts on behalf 
of the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Channell said North worked closely with the private fund-raising operation for 
the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
He said that after one contributor, John Ramsey of Wichita Falls, Tex., wired 
money to pay for a Contra shipment that was about to be unloaded, North sent 
him a mailgram saying, "Thank you for the help on such short notice." 
</P>
<P>
North ended a powerful address and slide show to 30 potential contributors on 
June 27, 1985, at the Old Executive Office Building by displaying a picture of 
the grave of what he said was a young Contra soldier and saying, "Can't 
American do better than this? America should be doing better than this," 
according to Channell. 
</P>
<P>
During the congressional Iran-Contra hearings two years ago, North testified, 
"I do not recall ever asking a single, solitary American citizen for money."

The General Accounting Office told Congress, in a report released today, that 
states have found problems ranging from physical and sexual abuse to improperly 
stored food and trash at rest homes and similar residential facilities for the 
elderly and mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
It reported on the board-and-care homes, which are residences of last resort 
for many aged and mentally ill people. "It is frightening how little we know 
about board-and-care homes," said Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.), ranking Republican 
on the Senate Special Committee on Aging. "This is an industry out of sight and 
out of control."

Pepsi-Cola Co. canceled plans to run a two-minute commercial with pop star 
Madonna on MTV after the cable network started airing the singer's 
controversial new music video, a source close to Pepsi said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepsi ad with Madonna, which is dubbed "Make a Wish" and includes an 
abbreviated version of her new song, "Like a Prayer," debuted last Thursday on 
television shows in 40 countries. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, MTV began running a separate music video that heralded the launch 
of the singer's new song. The video shows Madonna in a black slip, dancing 
among burning crosses and seeking refuge in a church where she kisses a statue 
of a saint who comes to life. 
</P>
<P>
Pepsi had planned to run the two-minute ad last weekend on MTV, but withheld it 
while the video is running, the source said.

The Soviet Union reversed itself today and said it is ready to accept the 
jurisdiction of the World Court in disputes on certain human rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Adamishin told a U.N. meeting that 
Moscow had dropped previous reservations on optional clauses in five 
international human rights accords allowing unresolved disputes to be submitted 
to the World Court in The Hague. 
</P>
<P>
These accords, he said, covered preventing and punishing genocide, suppressing 
traffic in persons and exploitation of prostitution, recognizing the political 
rights of women, eliminating all forms of racial discrimination and a 
convention against torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or 
punishment.

Giugni said he traveled to inspect security at senators' home state offices, to

The United States pledged today to accept 25,000 more Indochinese refugees and 
help finance efforts to solve the 14-year-old exodus from Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Moore, U.S. coordinator for refugee affairs, disclosed the figure in 
the wake of criticism from Southeast Asian nations worried about dwindling 
numbers of refugees absorbed by the United States over the last few years, 
estimated at 24,000 to 27,000. 
</P>
<P>
After two days of deliberations among delegates from 37 countries, Moore said 
the U.S. budget for fiscal 1990 includes funding for an influx of 25,000 
refugees, with the bulk coming from Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, 891,391 Indochinese have been 
resettled in the United States.

The government announced today that it is expelling an unspecified number of 
Iranians "on security grounds" because of Iran's death sentence against 
novelist Salman Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
It also warned Britons living in Lebanon to leave, saying they are under 
increased threat following Iran's severing of diplomatic ties with Britain on 
Tuesday. Three Britons are held hostage in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, announced the expulsions in the House 
of Commons. Britain also ordered the closing of the Iranian Consulate in Hong 
Kong, a British colony, and gave the staff two weeks to leave, Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
His comments came after an Iranian newspaper today said the break in 
British-Iranian ties will adversely affect the British hostages in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Howe, noting that Iran has refused to revoke its death sentence against 
Rushdie, said: "We have therefore decided on security grounds a number of 
Iranians must be required to leave this country. 
</P>
<P>
"We are keeping the activities of other Iranians under very close review," he 
added. He said the expulsion orders would be issued shortly. There are about 
25,000 Iranians in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
A government source said the number being expelled was up to 30.

DOW UP 4.83 AS INVESTOR JITTERS COOL OFF EARLY RALLY

Wall Street stocks closed with modest gains today as investor jitters ahead of 
Friday's unemployment report took some of the steam out of an early rally 
fueled by strength in bonds and the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 4.83 points at 2,295.54.

Advances led declines by almost four to three on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Big Board volume totaled 167.62 million shares, against 172.50 million in the 
previous session.

Blue chips were up by over 20 points at midday, piercing the key 2,300 mark 
amid strong bonds and a surging dollar. But the rally soon cooled as investors 
took to the sidelines ahead of Friday's report on February U.S. unemployment, 
which will shed light on the economy's current strength and its prospects for 
future inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 10/32 at 98-4/32 when the NYSE 
closed, dipping its yield to 9.06% from 9.09%. The dollar rose to 1.8630 West 
German marks from 1.8535 and to 129.22 yen from 128.75 after chief White House 
economist Michael Boskin said the Bush Administration was willing to discuss 
raising taxes -- indicating a possible move toward reducing the federal budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were down in early trading today as a listless market continued 
awaiting the government's release of February unemployment figures on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't really have any drivers," said Elliott Platt, research director at 
DL&amp;J Securities Corp. "Everyone's really just looking for the next piece of 
data." 
</P>
<P>
Platt said there was little change in the dollar in overseas trading today and 
no other factors that normally affect credit markets. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were off 1/32 to 3/32 point, intermediate maturities fell 3/32 point and 
long-term issues were down as much as 7/32 point, according to Telerate Inc., 
the financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, fell 0.89 to 1,122.80. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9 9/16%, up from 8 3/4% late Tuesday. Analysts attributed the sharp 
rise to short-term factors such as snowy weather in New York and the Eastern 
Airlines strike that affected the flow of funds in the banking system.

DROP IN NATIONAL SAVINGS RATE BLAMED FOR TRADE DEFICIT 
</P>

An alarming decline in the national savings rate is the biggest economic 
problem facing the United States and the chief cause of its huge trade 
deficits, according a private report released today. 
</P>
<P>
The report, by the private American Business Conference, said that while the 
government's huge budget deficits have contributed to the problem, the decline 
primarily has been caused by high consumption by individuals. 
</P>
<P>
"This overconsumption is financed through large-scale sales of U.S. assets to 
foreigners at unfavorable terms, a process that postpones the day of reckoning 
but that increasingly mortgages the U.S. economic future," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
It said the decline in national savings also heightens the risk of recession 
and ultimately leads to slower growth in the standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, national savings -- the difference between the nation's output in 
goods and services and what is consumed by government and individuals -- fell 
from 7.9% in the 1970s to 2.1% during 1985-87, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
Over the same period, individuals' consumption of goods and services rose from 
69.3% of national income to 74.1%. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in personal consumption was attributed largely to growth in 
disposable income, a rise in household wealth that exceeded the increase in 
national wealth, the maturing of the population to ages above 16 when spending 
is higher, and the spending of equity that was converted to cash in corporate 
takeovers and buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the tendency to spend what is on hand is highlighted when 
people receive unexpected lumps of cash from their stock investments when they 
are paid premiums in the course of corporate buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
The authors said action is needed on three fronts to boost the national savings 
rate from a low point that is unprecedented in a period of economic expansion, 
not only for the United States but for all industrialized countries: 
</P>
<P>
* Reducing the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
* Improving incentives for private saving. 
</P>
<P>
* Eliminating incentives for corporate buyouts.

After several years of economic decline, many sub-Saharan African countries are 
showing encouraging signs of turning themselves around, a World Bank report 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence of the past three years leaves room for optimism," the report 
declared. "These encouraging signs, though still preliminary, augur well for 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
The bank hopes the report will encourage the African nations to continue 
reforms and encourage the international community to continue financial 
support. "Prospects for recovery in Africa appear to be much sounder than a lot 
of people thought," said senior economist Charles Humphreys, one of the 
report's authors. 
</P>
<P>
Many economic trends are becoming positive in the region, he said. Agriculture 
has improved strongly, while exports, excluding oil, grew by 3% a year between 
1985 and 1987.

Miami Heat forward-center Pat Cummings has been sidelined for the rest of the 
season by a stress fracture in his left tibia. Cummings suffered the injury in 
Sunday's game against the Detroit Pistons. He'll be in a cast for four weeks 
and then will undergo nearly two weeks of rehabilitation. Cummings, 32, has a 
one-year contract with the Heat, which means he becomes an unrestricted free 
agent after the season.

SCHNEIDER TIES RECORD WITH GIANT SLALOM

Swiss superstar Vreni Schneider tied a World Cup record with her 13th victory 
of the season when she won a women's giant slalom ski race today. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," Schneider said after beating Yugoslavia's Mateja Svet 
by .77 seconds for her sixth victory in seven giant slaloms this season. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 victories equals the mark established by Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark, who 
won 10 giant slaloms and three slaloms in 1979. One of Schneider's victories 
was in a combined event, in which the result of a downhill and a slalom were 
factored together to form a third, or combined, result. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, winner of the women's overall, giant slalom and slalom titles 
already, had previously broken the women's record of 11 victories, set in 1973 
by Austria's Annemarie Moser-Proell. 
</P>
<P>
Heading into the final women's race of the season, a slalom on Saturday, 
Schneider, 24, has the opportunity to win an unprecedented 14th event and 13th 
race. A win also would give Schneider a sweep of the season's seven slaloms, 
making her only the fourth skier to complete an unbeaten season in an Alpine 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
Jean-Claude Killy of France swept the five downhills contested in 1967, 
Moser-Proell won the eight women's downhills in 1973 and Stenmark won all 10 
giant slaloms in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider completed two runs over the 50-gate, 4,089-foot Mt. Nishidate course 
in 2 minutes, 22.57 seconds. Svet, who finished second in the season giant 
slalom standings, was timed in 2:23.34. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Meier of West Germany was third in 2:23.89. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Walliser of Switzerland, a distant second behind her teammate in the 
overall standings, was fourth in 2:24.27.

SCOTT OSTLER: THE FAST LANE HAS ITS SHARE OF DRAWBACKS

<P>
Being Jose Canseco is not a bad gig, according to Jose Canseco, but there are 
minor inconveniences. 
</P>
<P>
You might, for instance, find yourself cruising along a lonely stretch of 
Florida expressway late at night in your new red Jaguar, not paying much 
attention to your speedometer. Or maybe it's just that when the car edges over 
120, the speedometer needle comes close to disappearing into the glove 
compartment. 
</P>
<P>
You happen to be driving a car that is as big, powerful, smooth and fast as you 
are and you don't realize you're doing 140 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"One day I'll take you for a ride in my car," Canseco says, pleading his case 
in the Oakland Athletics dugout before Tuesday's game against the Angels. 
"You'll see, it's the weirdest illusion. You can be going 100 and it seems like 
you're going 50." 
</P>
<P>
Dangerous car. What if you're doing a mere 50, you have the illusion of being 
parked and you try to step out of the car? 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Canseco was tooling along in his new red Jaguar at about 140 m.p.h. He 
didn't realize he had picked up a tail of five Miami PD cruisers, valiantly 
giving chase. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, on his way to meet his wife, exited the expressway and the cops 
whizzed past in the night. Then Jose realized that he had taken the wrong exit 
and got back on the highway, this time right behind the five cop cars that were 
chasing him. 
</P>
<P>
"Hmmmm," he thought. "Somebody's in real trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Still unaware he was the guy, Canseco drove a bit more, then left the 
expressway again. But the cops doubled back and got him. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I committed a crime," Canseco says. "I thought I murdered someone. 
They made me get out of the car, made me put my hands on the car, frisked me. 
It was like "Miami Vice." All the other (police) cars came peeling in. I 
thought, 'Holy . . . , don't shoot!' " 
</P>
<P>
That was one of the highlights of the off-season for Jose Canseco, the 
ballplayer of the future, perhaps the game's most awesome presence, history's 
first 40-40 man -- homers and steals. 
</P>
<P>
But there were others: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He was a no-show at a Baltimore dinner in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He was traveling with a cousin who was arrested at the Detroit airport for 
trying to board a plane with a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He got married, but his honeymoon conflicted with a Miami parade in his 
honor. He says nobody told him about the parade, and he missed it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He was a no-show at a big baseball card show, explaining that a cousin had 
botched the travel arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Last week in Phoenix, he was stopped -- in his Jag again -- and cited for 
an improper turn on a red light. The police officer also cited Canseco for 
having no driver's license, no registration, no proof of insurance, and the 
wrong license plate. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot of all this is that Canseco has discovered Newton's First Law of 
Superstardom: 
</P>
<P>
"When everything goes," Jose says with a sigh, "it all goes at once." 
</P>
<P>
After the recent auto snafu in Phoenix, Canseco was called into a meeting with 
Sandy Alderson, the A's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I used that incident as a vehicle -- pun intended -- for discussing larger 
issues that arose during the off-season," Alderson says. 
</P>
<P>
The A's and Alderson still love Jose Canseco, as a player and a person. They 
simply want to help him adjust to life in the fast lane, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
"He has to realize he is now viewed as larger than life," Alderson says. 
</P>
<P>
Faster, too, although the Jag has been garaged and Jose now putt-putts around 
Phoenix in a sedate white Corvette, usually driven by his wife. Just as well. 
</P>
<P>
As Alderson says, "A lot of things I can do in my '75 Oldsmobile station wagon, 
you can't do in an '89 customized Jaguar with a candy-apple red paint job. If 
you're going to drive that kind of car, draw that kind of attention, you'd 
better have your . . . together." 
</P>
<P>
Jose Canseco seems to have it together fairly well, if you consider that he's a 
24-year-old who got a lot of fame and fortune in a hurry and is starting to 
feel some backlash. Last season, for instance, a sportswriter accused Canseco, 
on national TV, of using steroids, without offering a shred of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Alderson says: "Going back to that steroid business, when the Red Sox fans 
taunted him (chanting 'Steroids!'), he totally disarmed them with his 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco smiled engagingly at the fans and flexed his biceps. 
</P>
<P>
He is a player who signs lots of autographs at the ballpark and is available to 
and amiable with reporters. Writers who travel with the team say they have 
never seen him so much as sip a beer, and he's not a night-clubber. When his 
twin brother, Ozzie, got married last winter, Jose bought the new couple a 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a very simple person," Canseco says. "Things I enjoy are cars and music, 
and now I'm getting into boats. But it seems like you can't drive your car 
without being pulled over." 
</P>
<P>
If there's naivete in that statement, there's also an effort to convey the 
feeling that he has been crushed by the avalanche of publicity you get from 
hitting .307 with 42 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, I had no life of my own in the off-season," Canseco says. "I didn't 
spend enough time really relaxing, doing things I like to do. The problem was, 
I wanted to please everyone and I couldn't. I got caught up in that. I'm new at 
this sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
He mentions the Miami parade he missed, shakes his head and says sadly, "I was 
never told. All the children were disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco had already committed to several card-show appearances in the 
off-season, and when his stock skyrocketed late in the season, and in the 
playoffs and World Series, he was flooded with more offers, including charity 
appearances he hated to turn down. 
</P>
<P>
"If I hit 100 card shows and miss one, that's a pretty good percentage," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Not to the promoters and fans at the one show he missed, it's not. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be some kind of robot, a mechanical machine," Jose says. 
</P>
<P>
These are times of minor crisis for Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
Alderson says: "The difference now is, he's under the microscope now. People 
are looking for his foibles, for his weaknesses, for his flaws. . . . It will 
be interesting to see how he reacts to all this. Some situations can be 
exacerbated by reacting negatively." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Canseco is a positive, de-exacerbating kind of guy. 
</P>
<P>
"I always look at things positive," he says. "My father's different, he's a 
negative person. . . . I enjoy who I am. I wouldn't trade it for the world. I 
understand it (the constant attention and overreaction to his every move), it's 
part of baseball." 
</P>
<P>
So Jose takes it, and learns, and adjusts, and maintains a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
He says the red Jaguar is in the shop. What for? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting a better engine put in," he says. "More horsepower." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how fast his new, 40-foot-long, cigarette-style racing boat can go, 
Canseco says, "Well, see, there's no speed limit on the water, thank God." 
</P>
<P>
If the boat will go 140 knots, Canseco has a chance to become baseball's first 
140-140 man.

On a quiet spring afternoon, a long way from the tumult that was Dodger Stadium 
when Kirk Gibson limped to the plate and hit the two-out, two-run, ninth-inning 
home run that gave the Dodgers a 5-4 victory in the first game of the 1988 
World Series, relief pitcher Dennis Eckersley of the Oakland Athletics 
reflected on the pitch and said: 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm a big reason we didn't win the World Series, but I feel like 
I'm a big reason we got there. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering where my career was two years ago, and considering how my life has 
changed in the two years, one home run is not going to damage that or screw it 
up. I feel very fortunate. I feel very happy." 
</P>
<P>
Time has worked its miracles, easing the immediate shock and consternation 
Eckersley experienced after delivering that "one stupid pitch." 
</P>
<P>
But time alone has not forged his perspective. 
</P>
<P>
In his first full season as a relief pitcher, Eckersley saved 45 games, one shy 
of the major league record. He saved four more in the American League playoffs 
with the Boston Red Sox and was selected most valuable player of that series. 
</P>
<P>
Should one pitch detract from that? 
</P>
<P>
Can one pitch be measured against a fight with alcoholism, a difficult divorce 
and the threat of another? 
</P>
<P>
What is one pitch when weighed against the uncertainty of his career -- and 
life -- just two years ago? How can one pitch compare to the emotional jolt of 
having an older brother facing trial on charges that include kidnaping, sexual 
assault and attempted murder? 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, it wasn't like Alfredo Griffin took me deep," Eckersley said. "Kirk 
Gibson is a hell of a player, a hard-nosed guy. He was the National League's 
MVP. He was the Dodgers last year." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first and last Series appearance for the National League's MVP. It 
was a moment forever framed in the camera of the mind. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I'll always remember is two of the best competitors in the game 
going at each other, neither giving in," A's Manager Tony LaRussa said. "And 
the thing I'll always remember about Eck isn't that he gave up the home run, 
but that he came into his first World Series appearance and blew away the first 
two guys on five pitches. It was no contest. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he may have gotten too fine. Michael Davis didn't have a great year, but 
we'd seen what he can do when you make a mistake over the middle of the plate. 
Eck tried to pitch him away and just missed." 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley replaced Dave Stewart at the start of the ninth with the A's leading, 
4-3. Mike Scioscia popped up. Jeff Hamilton struck out. Davis, batting .196, 
hit for Griffin, took the count to 3-and-1, then walked. 
</P>
<P>
"He was stepping in and out of the batter's box and it kind of drained my 
rhythm," Eckersley said. "I saw him as the last out and I got impatient. I 
wanted to say, 'Get to the plate! Let's go!' Maybe I was trying to be too 
careful, but I felt at the time that I was going at 'em and that the ball was 
sailing on me. 
</P>
<P>
"Doesn't matter. A two-out walk is inexcusable." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 55,983 erupted when out limped Gibson, sidelined by injuries to 
both knees, to bat for Alejandro Pena. 
</P>
<P>
Surprised? 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all," Eckersley said. "It's a one-run game in the ninth inning of the 
World Series. Who else would they want up there?" 
</P>
<P>
Cognizant of Gibson's sore knees and the likelihood that he would be swinging 
off balance, Eckersley and catcher Ron Hassey played country hardball. 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley threw three straight fastballs, all of which Gibson fouled off. Then 
a fastball sailed wide for a ball, another was fouled off, another went wide 
for a ball, then a 2-and-2 breaking ball missed as Davis stole second, not 
drawing a throw. The count was full and Hassey called for the fatal slider, 
hoping he said, to freeze Gibson with a breaking ball after all the fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson swung awkwardly and hit the ball deep into the right-field pavilion and 
the teeth of instant pandemonium. 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley, who had allowed only five home runs in the 72 2/3 innings of 60 
regular-season appearances, walked off, dazed. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of took the breath out of me," he said. "It kind of took the breath 
out of all of us. Normally, you give up one in the ninth inning and teammates 
are patting you on the back and saying, 'You'll get 'em the next time.' But no 
one said anything. We were all too stunned." 
</P>
<P>
Was it the wrong call, the wrong pitch? LaRussa wouldn't say so at the time. 
Now? 
</P>
<P>
"If I had my druthers, a fastball would have been the better pitch," he said. 
"Gibson was in his two-strike emergency stance. His legs were spread, he was 
just looking to put the ball in play. It's possible he could have fought off a 
fastball, dropped it in for a single and tied the game, but I don't think he 
could have hit a fastball out of the park. In his stance, he got a pitch he 
could. 
</P>
<P>
"The easiest people in baseball to second-guess are the manager, pitcher and 
catcher. You could see what they were trying to do. It wasn't a bad idea, it 
just wasn't the best idea." 
</P>
<P>
Said Eckersley: "I didn't second-guess the call. I didn't shake it off. I don't 
think he could have hit a fastball out, but that's hindsight. 
</P>
<P>
"In my mind, I was trying to waste the pitch, give him something low and away. 
I think he'd have swung even if it wasn't a strike. My mistake was that I got 
too much of the plate. I put it where he could handle it. Sometimes it's not 
what you throw, it's where you throw it." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger scout Mel Didier claimed at the end of the Series that he had detected a 
tendency by Eckersley to throw the back-door slider on full counts and had told 
the team about it before the Series. He said that Gibson told him he had been 
thinking back-door slider when the count went full. 
</P>
<P>
"That's ridiculous," said Eckersley, who has issued only 23 unintentional walks 
in the last two years. "How many times do I go to a full count, let alone some 
scout calling it?" 
</P>
<P>
Said LaRussa: "I respect Mel. I'm sure that if he scouted Dennis, he saw him 
throw a slider in that situation once in a while. But for every four batters he 
has faced with two strikes, three have gotten fastballs. Gibson didn't hit the 
slider out because he was looking for it, but because he was in his emergency 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I hope hitters now start looking for that back-door slider because 
they'll be wrong three out of four times." 
</P>
<P>
Whether Gibson was operating on inside information or not, his home run seemed 
to devastate the A's. They were never the team that had won 104 games during 
the regular season and had swept the Boston Red Sox in four in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurt at the time, but we didn't think we were dead," Eckersley said of the 
homer. "We just couldn't beat Hershiser. Everyone talks about the Series in 
terms of Gibson's home run, but it was just as much Orel Hershiser's show." 
</P>
<P>
Said LaRussa: "Do you know how many times this club suffered adversity and came 
back to turn it to our advantage? I think the Gibson homer helped the Dodgers 
more than it hurt us. No way did it cost us the Series. There were other 
reasons we didn't play better." 
</P>
<P>
LaRussa also said that he expects Eckersley to bounce back with a comparable 
season, that he has weathered too much adversity -- on and off the field -- to 
be burdened with the memory of one pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Adversity? 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley, 34, won't talk about the trial his older brother, Wally, soon faces 
at Colorado Springs, Colo. He confirms, however, that his own life had been 
plagued by alcoholism, that the highs, lows and bright lights of a career that 
began when he joined the Cleveland Indians at 20 exacerbated the illness. He 
pumped his arm after strikeouts and continued to pump it when the game was 
over, thinking he would miss something if he didn't go out. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Eckersley was the American League's rookie pitcher of the year in 
1975. He struck out 200 batters in 199 innings in 1976 and threw a no-hitter 
against the Angels in 1977. Then, after being traded to the Red Sox at 23, he 
went 20-8 with a 2.99 earned-run average in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
On the day that he was traded -- March 30, 1978 -- Eckersley also got the 
jarring news that his first wife, Denise, wanted a divorce so she could marry 
his best friend, Cleveland teammate Rick Manning. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, still attempting to cope with that and his first confrontation 
with arm problems, Eckersley said, he married Nancy O'Neil, a model and 
part-time actress who had earned a masters degree in communications at Boston 
College. 
</P>
<P>
The marriage, according to Eckersley, survives and prospers, but it, too, was 
in jeopardy, a potential victim, Nancy warned him, of his drinking, which 
reached its worst during three seasons of day games with the Chicago Cubs. 
Self-destruction beckoned. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally knew I needed help," Eckersley said. 
</P>
<P>
In January of 1987, Eckersley entered a treatment facility at Newport, R.I. Six 
weeks later, having come to grips and shaken the "emotional baggage" he had 
been carrying, he emerged to a new life -- and career. A strengthening machine 
replaced the bottle. The A's, aware of Eckersley's competitiveness but unaware 
of his personal problems, traded for him in April of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
And when Jay Howell went down with an arm injury in mid-season, Eckersley moved 
to the bullpen and saved 16 games, prompting the A's to include Howell in the 
three-way deal that brought Bob Welch from the Dodgers after the '87 season. 
</P>
<P>
Now, though Eckersley still operates from "a fear of failure" in his closer 
role, he enjoys the "feeling of greater importance." He credits the success of 
the Oakland set-up men for his own 1988 success and says: "I couldn't be in a 
better situation. I don't think I ever threw three days in a row. I don't think 
I ever pitched as early as the seventh inning. My arm is strong." 
</P>
<P>
And, Eckersley said, he has never felt better about himself. A friendship with 
Welch, who went through alcohol treatment with the Dodgers, has provided 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 31 and didn't know where the hell I was going," Eckersley said. "I had 
to make some decisions, and fortunately they were the right ones, especially 
when you consider that I'm now relieving. I couldn't have done it every day, 
the way I was drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"The most gratifying thing is that you can change your life and good things 
will happen. You can have hope. I think that's what the message is." 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley said that he didn't sleep on the night of Gibson's homer. He and 
Nancy stayed up talking. Friends later gave him a videotape of his four playoff 
saves, but he didn't watch it until a few days before he reported to training 
camp. That one pitch to Gibson was still haunting his thoughts. Now, he said, 
he has it in perspective. In fact, he smiled and said: 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like a long time ago, but for a long time it didn't. I'm sorry I was 
the one who threw it, but it was great for the TV ratings and good for 
baseball. I can appreciate that, though I didn't enjoy it. I'm sorry I didn't 
get a chance for redemption, but maybe Kirk and I will meet again someday. 
Maybe this year. That would be nice."

JUDGE RULES THREE IN CONFLICT OVER LOS ALAMITOS VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three members of the California Horse Racing Board were in conflict of interest 
when they voted against a request by harness interests for additional racing 
rights at Los Alamitos Race Course, a Sacramento Superior Court judge ruled 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In ruling on a suit against the racing board, Judge Allen Fields said that CHRB 
chairman Leslie Liscom, Ray Seeley and Rosemary Ferraro should have 
disqualified themselves from voting because of connections with Hollywood Park, 
which owns Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Liscom works for and has a small interest in an insurance brokerage that does 
about $1-million of business with Hollywood Park. For several years, Seeley has 
been allowed to park his motor home track property without paying rent. Ferraro 
accepted in excess of $250 in meals and drinks from Hollywood Park during a 
12-month period, a violation of state regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-member racing board had designated a 17-week harness season at Los 
Alamitos, but harness officials wanted to extend the season by five weeks. 
Their request was denied, which prompted the suit against the CHRB. 
</P>
<P>
The racing board will have to reconsider the application for an extended 
harness season, which was scheduled to end March 25. Tuesday's decision leaves 
Los Alamitos' quarter horse season, which was to begin next week, in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major victory for the harness industry in California," said Ron 
Zumbrun, a spokesman for harness interests. "This shows that the racing board 
must start following the statutes and not let itself be subjected to 
manipulation." 
</P>
<P>
Liscom declined to comment. Bob Forgnone, Hollywood Park's attorney, was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Olson, a CHRB attorney, said: "They (harness officials) lost, not us, 
because they wanted the judge to give them the extra weeks and he didn't do 
that."

JOHNSON WAS WORRIED ABOUT TEST, FRANCIS' FRIEND SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Canadian Coach Charlie Francis, who claimed that sprinter Ben Johnson's urine 
sample at the Seoul Olympics was spiked with a banned steroid, told an 
acquaintance in Seoul that Johnson had worried that he might test positive. 
</P>
<P>
Lynda Huey, who was at Seoul working for NBC-TV and as a physical therapist for 
some American athletes, said Tuesday that Francis had bragged to her about 
Johnson's preparations for a showdown against U.S. sprinter Carl Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Huey said she had known Francis since 1980 when he and sprinter Angella Taylor 
Issajenko stayed at her home in Los Angeles. Huey said she had seen Francis on 
a practice track at Seoul and he had greeted her as an old friend. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie came over to me and we started talking," Huey said. "We were talking 
about how Ben might do. Charlie said, 'Ben's more afraid of failing the drug 
test than he is of Carl Lewis.' He was bragging." 
</P>
<P>
Huey said she is tired of hearing Francis, who has been in Toronto testifying 
at a Canadian inquiry into drug use in sport, say that Johnson was clean at the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Francis testified that Johnson was not taking the steroid, stanozolol, before 
the Games and that a mysterious person might have slipped something into 
Johnson's beverage in the drug-testing area before the sprinter gave his urine 
specimen. 
</P>
<P>
Clean or not, Huey said, "Francis must have had some reason to think Ben may 
not pass the test." JULIE CART

Rick Mears, a three-time Indianapolis 500 winner, and a companion were fined 
$20,000 each and forfeited the skins of two grizzly bears after pleading no 
contest to misdemeanor game violations in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Businessman Michael Stier said that he and Mears, both of Bakersfield, were 
unaware they were violating state law because they were hunting with a licensed 
guide during a 1987 trip. But Stier conceded that "ignorance is no excuse." 
Mears was unavailable for comment.

Agent Norby Walters spread $2,500 in cash on a desk in front of Ronnie Harmon 
to persuade him to sign a contract that violated National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. rules, the former Iowa running back told a federal jury. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon, now with the Buffalo Bills, was the first witness in the Chicago fraud 
trial of New York-based agents Walters and Lloyd Bloom. 
</P>
<P>
Walters spread out the money on the desk of his New York office in front of 
Harmon, then a junior at Iowa, Harmon testified. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about business. The product is Ronnie Harmon," Walters said in a 
conversation Harmon tape-recorded March 10, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
During the 15 months he dealt with Bloom and Walters, Harmon said, he received 
a new Mercedes, plane tickets and other items worth about $54,000. He said he 
fired the agents a few days after Bloom had negotiated a $1.3-million contract 
for Harmon with the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination, Harmon said he paid Bloom and Walters a total of 
$5,000. But he fired them before they could collect a commission on his 
National Football League contract.
