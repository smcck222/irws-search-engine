CRACKDOWN IN PARKS BRINGS 16 ARRESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid complaints from West Hollywood officials that drug dealing and alcohol 
abuse are out of control in that city's two main parks, at least 16 people have 
been arrested as part of a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department crackdown in 
the parks in the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been asked (by city officials) to clean up the parks, and that's what we 
intend to do," said Capt. Rachel Burgess, who supervises the West Hollywood 
sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials said 10 of the arrests occurred at West Hollywood Park, 
where the city operates a temporary shelter for homeless people and where an 
increasing number of the homeless have congregated in recent months. Another 
six people were arrested at Plummer Park. 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown so far has been aimed at stricter enforcement of a midnight-to-6 
a.m. curfew, and the department will soon begin using plainclothes sheriff's 
deputies in the parks, Burgess said.

RUNAWAYS' SHELTER CUTS SIZE TO 20 BEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Covenant House, a private social welfare agency with hopes of opening a 100-bed 
crisis shelter for runaway teen-agers in Hollywood, has run into opposition 
from competing social agencies and will instead operate a 20-bed shelter, 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Covenant House will open its scaled-down shelter this summer, said Anne 
Donahue, executive director of Covenant House California. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have not chosen the site for the shelter, but City Councilman Michael 
Woo said he will work closely with Covenant House to find a location. 
</P>
<P>
Other social service agencies that serve teen-agers opposed Covenant House's 
original plan to open a 100-bed shelter, contending it was too large. 
</P>
<P>
Some community members also opposed the shelter, saying it would act as a 
magnet, attracting jobless, homeless teen-agers to Hollywood, which already has 
a large population of runaways.

'SELL-OUT IN CENTRAL AMERICA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While reading Fred C. Ikle's column ("Sell-Out in Central America," Op-Ed Page, 
Feb. 26), I was sadly reminded that although the Reagan Administration is now 
thankfully out of office and its functionaries are now safely dissipated 
throughout the country, its myths and myopic visions still linger. 
</P>
<P>
Ikle laments the "unraveling" of eight years of U.S.-backed democracy-building 
in Central America, citing "today's majority view in Congress" as the culprit 
behind setbacks in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. But what he fails to 
admit is that there was little in these countries to unravel in the first 
place, since the Reagan Administration truly did nothing to promote democracy 
in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Ikle's entire argument rests on one very flawed assumption, promoted throughout 
Reagan's eight-year tenure -- namely, that "free" elections equate to 
democracy. Was El Salvador nearly a true democracy because its peasants were 
forced to vote in "free" elections? Was Guatemala becoming equally democratic 
because its indigenous population was being relocated to re-education camps? 
</P>
<P>
There can be no denying that the economy in Nicaragua is a shambles (due mostly 
to Reagan's obsessive war against that small nation), and that the Sandinistas 
have yet to solve this disastrous problem. And, admittedly, certain 
restrictions on freedom of speech persist in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is also no denying the fact that the Sandinistas have not waged 
a repressive war against the people of their nation, murdering hundreds of 
suspected insurgents and dislocating thousands of peasants. 
</P>
<P>
It infuriates me that people like Ikle expect Nicaragua to prove to the world 
that it is moving toward democratic reform, while these same people would have 
us complacently believe that El Salvador and Guatemala are burgeoning 
democracies going awry, thanks to a Democratic Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua has a long road ahead if it is to acquire a buoyant democracy. But, 
if the models of El Salvador and Guatemala are to serve as examples, it is 
obvious that Reagan-style reforms are not the answer.

THE GHOSTS OF KATYN FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What virtually all Poles have long believed the Polish government has at last 
officially confirmed. In a carefully worded statement, government spokesman 
Jerzy Urban says that "everything indicates" that the Soviet Union was 
responsible for the deaths of more than 4,000 Polish army officers whose bodies 
were unearthed near the Soviet city of Smolensk in 1943. Western historians 
long ago concluded that the evidence points overwhelmingly to Soviet 
responsibility for the crime. Moscow, for its part, has always claimed that the 
murders were committed by the German army when it occupied the western Soviet 
Union in the early 1940s. Until now, Poland's Communist government, installed 
by the Soviets in 1945, endorsed this version. Its public abandonment of that 
story represents something of a watershed in Polish-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
The 4,443 Polish soldiers whose bodies were buried in mass graves in the Katyn 
Forest represented only about one-fourth of the officers who were taken 
prisoner by the Red Army after it marched into eastern Poland in 1939. That 
invasion, carried out under secret agreements reached just weeks earlier as 
part of the German-Soviet nonaggression pact, helped seal Poland's fate. The 
captured officers were taken to the Soviet Union. Repeated requests for 
information about them by the wartime Polish government in exile brought no 
satisfactory responses. After the Germans found the bodies in 1943, they 
appointed an investigatory commission, including some neutral experts, which 
concluded on the basis of physical evidence that the men had been killed in 
1940. Each appeared to have been shot through the back of the head. The Soviets 
in turn blamed the Nazis for the atrocity. Significantly, though, the Russians 
did not repeat this allegation when they had the chance to do so in a legal 
forum at the postwar Nuremberg trials of German war criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Of the nearly 11,000 other Polish officers taken prisoner by the Soviets, 
nothing more has ever been heard. Presumably they too died in some killing 
field at the hands of Josef Stalin's secret police. The Poles have long held 
that the murders were part of a deliberate plan to eliminate their country's 
anti-Communist leadership. Whatever Stalin's exact motivation, the Katyn Forest 
massacre and the long failure of Soviet authorities to deal with the truth of 
the matter has helped deepen historic Polish distrust of the Soviet Union. 
Moscow, for its part, continues to say that the evidence of Soviet culpability 
in the massacre is only "circumstantial." The Polish people long ago decided 
otherwise. Now their government has too.

CAPT. BALIAN'S NAVY CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poor Capt. Alexander G. Balian ("Balian Looks Back at Wreckage of a Career," 
Feb. 25). No promotion to rear admiral. How could this happen? 
</P>
<P>
I know, it must be the Navy's fault. They are out to get Capt. Balian. No, on 
second thought, it's the military justice system. That's the culprit. Now that 
I think about it, though, it must be the prosecutor's fault. He's the bad guy. 
After all, he called the captains hearing the case "gentlemen" instead of 
"sir." As we look closer into this matter, it must be the crew's fault. They 
didn't inform the captain as to what was going on. Yeah, that sounds good. 
</P>
<P>
Better yet it was the refugees' fault. They shouldn't have been on the boat in 
the first place. So what if the refugees had been afloat for 18 days before 
Balian came across them. He had to go play war games instead of saving lives. 
</P>
<P>
While this may sound like a good film plot, the sad thing is Balian doesn't 
seem sorry that 58 people died because of his bad judgment. All he seems 
concerned about is his future career with the Navy. Well, Capt. Balian, you may 
never get promoted to rear admiral but at least you are still alive and that's 
more than the 58 people you let die have.

What short memories we Americans have! When Gen. Douglas MacArthur accepted the 
surrender of Japan on Sept. 2, 1945, one of the terms of surrender required 
Japan to draft a constitution pledged never to rearm again. 
</P>
<P>
Japan accepted our demand, and for the past 40 years has poured its major 
energies, money and resources into educating its young, in the fields of 
science, industry, business management, art and architecture. It is little 
wonder that Japan is attaining world influence in every direction. Japan has 
for two generations invested mainly in its young! It has taken to heart Walt 
Whitman's splendid injunction, "Create great persons. The rest all follows!" 
</P>
<P>
President George Bush wants to be known in history as "the Education 
President." He can be so known, if he makes education his and our highest 
priority, taking to heart Whitman's words, "And you America . . . to girlhood, 
boyhood look, the teacher and the school."

CAPT. BALIAN'S NAVY CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am outraged. A much decorated Navy hero, Capt. Balian, was court-martialed 
and convicted of dereliction of duty for using his best judgment during a 
confrontation with Vietnamese boat people in the South China Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six years in the Navy, qualified for promotion to rear admiral, he is 
being railroaded, because of so-called bad publicity to the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
The boat people put themselves in jeopardy by poor planning and irresponsible 
leadership. Balian, under orders to proceed to a "war zone," gave them food and 
assistance according to the information provided to him by his crew. 
</P>
<P>
His first duty was to his country, his crew and to his ship. He did not fail 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Will the Navy now order all ship captains to take aboard all refugee boat 
people, in distress or not, and transport them directly to the United States 
for absorption into the welfare system? 
</P>
<P>
Balian should be promoted, given another ship and get an apology from the Navy.

GIVING LABELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A study of the philanthropic giving of 122 American corporations has concluded 
that there is "an obvious bias to the left," and that most of them are "funding 
organizations clearly opposed to corporate interests." That surprising 
conclusion, however, depends on definitions. A close reading of the report 
reveals that the lean leftward is perceptible only to those who, like the 
sponsoring Capital Research Center, regard protection of the environment, race 
relations, international relations and peace as issues and activities of the 
left and as weakening the free market. 
</P>
<P>
A preface to the report by William E. Simon, the former secretary of the 
Treasury, removes all doubt that this is nothing more than a new exercise of 
the radical right to try to discourage participation in broadly based, 
mainstream public affairs programs by the private sector. Simon applauds gifts 
for the Red Cross, hospitals, religious institutions and "genuinely charitable 
causes." But he asserts that "an astonishing amount of money also is given to 
organizations whose special-interest advocacy is geared solely to promoting the 
political interests and fashionable nostrums of the left." He further says that 
"capitalism has no duty to underwrite its enemies," and concludes that the 
study "vividly portrays the extent to which America's corporate leadership is 
boring holes in the bottom of the ship so numerous and so large that those 
manning the pumps may soon be overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
Which holes are sinking the ship of state? Look, then, at some of the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
The African American Institute, the single most effective American organization 
maintaining ties with the leadership of emerging Africa, is rated "left," 
defined among other things as tending "to favor accommodation with 
anti-American Communist and Third World leaders." Nature Conservancy, with its 
global effort to acquire additional land for preserves and parks, is rated 
"center left," defined among other things as a group that "can be expected to 
favor more, or more expanded, government welfare and regulation." The Martin 
Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, led by Coretta Scott King, 
is rated "radical left/left," defined, among other things, as being among the 
groups that "favor a restructuring of the nation along generally socialist 
lines." And so it goes, including a rating for the League of Women Voters as 
left/liberal. Moving rightward on the scale, one comes at last to the meager 
support found flowing to "conservative" groups -- Heritage Foundation, Hoover 
Institution -- and "classical liberal" -- Cato Institute. The right-most 
classification is "radical right," but no recipient meeting that definition was 
uncovered in the research. Some, we among them, would argue that at least one 
of the groups seen as "conservative" might well be called "radical right." 
</P>
<P>
Given these definitions, it was inevitable that many of the most responsible 
American corporations, such as the St. Paul Companies, Dayton Hudson, 
Coca-Cola, Scott Paper and General Mills, would be listed as "left," thus 
benefiting organizations "opposed to corporate interests." That is nonsense. 
Rather than weaken the vitality of the marketplace in the United States, they 
have helped strengthen it, for the marketplace is integral to society and the 
lives of the people of that society. 
</P>
<P>
Capital Research defines corporate responsibility and public interest in terms 
unworthy of the tradition of those American businesses that have a vigorous 
commitment to using a portion of their resources for the public good. Such 
careless classifications may betray deliberate mischief with ideological 
intent. They certainly show ignorance of the role, unique among all the 
industrial democracies, that American business has played in helping public 
causes that many other nations leave as the sole province of government.

MARCOS' HEALTH IS NOT ISSUE, THE PHILIPPINES' HEALTH IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED LAGUATAN, Ted Laguatan, a lawyer based in San Francisco, is a special 
counsel for the Philippine government. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to avoid federal prosecution, former Philippine dictator Ferdinand 
Marcos and his associates are involved in a well-orchestrated campaign to give 
the perception that he is sick and near death and thus unable to travel to New 
York to face arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign is meant to gain the sympathy of the American and Filipino publics 
-- and not necessarily in that order. Marcos hopes to persuade the Filipino 
people that his time on Earth is about to run out, thereby putting pressure on 
the government of Corazon Aquino to relent and let him come home. And that 
would open the way for him to escape federal prosecution. He would lobby 
Washington for permission to leave his exile in Hawaii. The State Department 
would probably be willing to give its approval if the Aquino government, the 
real party of interest in the federal criminal cases against him, said he was 
welcome to return. 
</P>
<P>
While the Philippine government has no medical evidence to dispute the claims 
of Marcos or his doctors, it would be wise for everyone to remember that the 
ousted dictator and his wife Imedla are masters at creating perceptions. Both 
are great stage performers. In the past, when he wanted to give the impression 
of being in great health, Marcos would have himself videotaped lifting weights. 
Imelda Marcos can do an impression of crying Madonna, rosary and all, that 
would make a Hollywood director proud. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Marcos' health has often taken turns for the worse, particularly when it 
was convenient for him to be so disposed. Thus when Benigno S. Aquino Jr. was 
assassinated, Marcos persuaded many that he was so gravely ill that he could 
not possibly have given the order to kill the opposition leader. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos, 71, has been diagnosed as having pneumonia. But even if he is near 
death, does this mean he should be allowed to return to the Philippines? Let 
the present situation of the Filipino people answer that question. The country 
is $28 billion in debt. There is a legacy of institutionalized graft and 
corruption in government. Thousands of Filipinos have left the country for 
menial jobs abroad, separated from families and subject to abuse, alienation 
and loneliness. For those who remain, 70% live in conditions of mass poverty 
and suffer the attendant evils of crime, disease and ignorance. It is not 
uncommon to see Filipino children digging through heaps of stinking garbage to 
find discarded scraps of food. 
</P>
<P>
But the suffering is not limited just to those consigned to a life of 
impoverishment. The families of murdered opponents also bear the pain of the 
Marcos years. Torture victims carry the emotional and physical scars of their 
ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
Yet today Marcos remains unrepentant. Despite overwhelming evidence to the 
contrary, he continues to deny stealing billions of dollars from the Filipino 
people. He continues with his efforts to destabilize the present Philippine 
government, even after coup attempts that he helped finance failed. He still 
has tremendous resources at his command and uses them to influence the 
Philippine media or to buy the favors of corruptible civilian and military 
officials. To the dismay of so many, some of Marcos' worst murderers and 
torturers have remained uncharged or acquitted -- some even have been appointed 
to high office -- all because of his influence and resources. If he can create 
so many problems from outside the Philippines, it is unimaginable what he can 
do if he is allowed to return. The national security and interest of the 
Philippines must prevail above any of Marcos' reasons to return. 
</P>
<P>
As the Filipino people continue their difficult journey toward true democracy, 
it is well for them to look down the road through which they have passed. 
Toppling a terrible dictatorship by facing tanks and guns with prayers and 
rosaries and courage was a tremendous milestone in this journey and will always 
be something that Filipinos can truly point to with pride. But the journey must 
continue. Marcos cannot be allowed to stand in the way.

TEACHERS REJECT A BONUS? INCREDIBLE!; 
</P>
<P>
LATEST ATTACK AGAINST BILINGUAL CLASSES HAS A DUBIOUS SOURCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH F. KEHOE, Joseph F. Kehoe teaches in the Los Angeles school district. 
He was born in Argentina. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most people agree that teachers are underpaid. Most teachers would agree that 
"underpaid" is a gross understatement. Even in the increasingly ugly contract 
negotiations between the Los Angeles Unified School District and its teachers' 
union, both sides seem to see eye to eye on this point. Pleading fiscal 
limitations, management simply states that it would offer teachers more if 
there were more to offer. 
</P>
<P>
So it comes as a shock -- to use another understatement -- when teachers want 
to eliminate a chance to make more money. But that is exactly what some 
teachers in the district want to do. 
</P>
<P>
A group calling itself the Learning English Advocates Drive (LEAD), which 
receives financial support from two ultraconservative English-only 
organizations, wants the United Teachers of Los Angeles to reject the 
district's offer to pay bonuses of up to $5,000 a year to bilingual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
A vehement opponent of bilingual education, LEAD founder Sally Peterson instead 
favors an English immersion approach for the district's more than 160,000 
limited-English-speaking students. The San Fernando Valley teacher calls the 
pay incentives "totally divisive" for union members. 
</P>
<P>
UTLA President Wayne Johnson sees LEAD's proposal itself as divisive at this 
crucial point in contract negotiations, and has urged that it be withdrawn or 
defeated. The union membership is to vote on the proposal later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The consensus on both sides is that if LEAD's initiative becomes union policy 
-- Johnson sees its chances for passage as "very good" -- it will deal a 
crippling blow to the district's bilingual plan. The bonuses are essential if 
the district is to recruit and keep qualified bilingual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
But the bonuses serve another important purpose: motivation. The district hopes 
that they will act as incentives for monolingual teachers to learn a second 
language. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson's claim that the bonuses create disunity falls apart on this point. 
Anyone can learn Spanish. Any teacher can become eligible for the bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Does anyone object when a teacher's salary is increased after he or she earns a 
master's degree? Does anyone find it "divisive" when a teacher earns a few more 
salary points by taking a computer science class (or a basket-weaving one, for 
that matter)? Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
But go take a class on Hispanic culture or, God forbid, try to learn Spanish, 
and just watch the English-only partisans rise up to object. 
</P>
<P>
Most people know that learning another language is no easy task. There could be 
no better justification for bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
If confident, college-educated adults find it difficult to learn another 
language, how must children feel? Students in the "sink-or-swim" approach that 
LEAD backs are not only expected to learn English, but also reading, writing, 
mathematics, science and social studies in English. Granted, children generally 
acquire languages faster than adults, but not that fast. The adult equivalent 
to what these children are asked to do is mind-boggling: simultaneously 
learning another language, say, Russian, while reading "War and Peace" in 
Russian and tackling chemistry from a Russian text. Good luck. 
</P>
<P>
How did Peterson and her group become such enemies of bilingual education and 
the children it serves? The recent history of Glenwood School in Sun Valley, 
where Peterson teaches, sheds some light. The student population there has 
changed from predominantly white to mostly Latino in a short time. Frustrated 
at their own inability to meet the needs of their students, some teachers 
responded in reactionary fashion by demanding that students conform to the 
staff's limitations. The goal of education became lost and LEAD was born. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time, not so long ago, when Latino children might be physically 
punished by their teachers if they spoke Spanish in the classroom. (Perhaps for 
this reason, as she took me to my first day of kindergarten 25 years ago, my 
own mother warned me never to speak Spanish in school.) 
</P>
<P>
The typical non-English-speaking student in an immersion program quickly falls 
behind. He becomes frustrated and alienated. He learns to dislike himself and 
to hate school. If the system continues to fail him, he may be drawn to gangs, 
drugs or crime. Any of these will give him more validation than he received in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
(The feelings of inadequacy created by my own experience with language 
immersion techniques lasted long beyond elementary school. I am still dealing 
with some of them.) 
</P>
<P>
Bilingual education is built on the belief that children progress faster if 
they are taught academic subjects in their native language while they are 
learning English. Its goal is to teach students English. The only goal Peterson 
seems to have is to teach students in English. There is a big difference. 
</P>
<P>
Bilingual education is not perfect, but it is working. And considering LEAD's 
alternative, one can only conclude that there is no alternative. 
</P>
<P>
No one can doubt Peterson's sincere dislike of bilingual education. Any teacher 
who would turn down money to make a point must be deadly serious. Just the 
same, her proposal is both anti-student and anti-teacher. The only real 
beneficiary of the referendum is paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
Someone should remind the English-only advocates that the United States won the 
Mexican-American War; California really is part of the Union. And, yes, English 
remains firmly entrenched as an essential key to socioeconomic mobility. 
</P>
<P>
The language of maids and menials, as some of these pseudo-patriots regard 
Spanish, poses no threat to the American Way. The threat comes when we fail our 
kids.

FLAG WAS DEFILED BUT NO CHARGES LIKELY, D.A. SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has determined that a CalArts 
student violated state law with his controversial American flag exhibit but 
does not plan to file charges against him, a spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Greene's exhibit, which stirred immediate anger and debate, featured a 
flag draped across the floor in the main lobby of the Valencia campus. 
</P>
<P>
"We have determined that Adam Greene did, in fact, violate Section 614 of the 
Military and Veterans Code by defiling the flag," said Deputy Dist. Atty. James 
A. Baker. "He invited people to walk on the flag, and that is defiling the 
flag." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit has been closed since Monday evening, when two men snatched the 
flag and turned it in to the Santa Clarita sheriff's station. The men have not 
been charged because no one has filed a complaint against them, authorities 
said. Greene said he is considering filing such a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 28-year-old student faces an official inquest after several 
residents from the surrounding community called sheriff's deputies to report 
his exhibit. The maximum penalty for misdemeanor flag defiling is six months in 
jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the best way to resolve this matter is to require him and an 
administrator from the college to attend a hearing at the district attorney's 
office in which we explain the law and the court decisions on free speech," 
Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Greene said he will not return Baker's calls until he consults an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"You have the local district attorney, and he wants to have this conference 
with me and what is it about?" Greene said. "It's about scare tactics." 
</P>
<P>
Greene's exhibit was meant as a show of support for another art student, Scott 
Tyler, whose similar artwork has attracted protests at the School of the Art 
Institute of Chicago. Both pieces featured a flag on the floor and a ledger in 
which visitors could write comments. Both exhibits made it difficult to write 
in the book without stepping on the flag. 
</P>
<P>
Such artwork should be protected by First Amendment rights, Greene argued. 
Baker said those rights have legal limits. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, you cannot paint swastikas on Jewish temples and you cannot burn 
a cross on someone's lawn," the deputy district attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
CalArts officials said they will cooperate with authorities. Greene said he 
will seek legal counsel from the American Civil Liberties Union or attorney 
Gloria Allred.

PANEL VOTES TO RESUME STUDY ON RAIL ROUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, brushing aside objections 
from angry homeowners, voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to resume a study of San 
Fernando Valley rail route options and declared its intent to pick a route by 
next March. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's 9-0 vote ended nearly two months of delay during which 
homeowners fighting rail routes that traverse their neighborhoods sought to 
have the routes deleted from the study. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which is building a countywide network of rail lines, also 
voted to grant a request from Valley rail backers to delay any action on two 
competing rail projects until March, 1990, so the Valley study can be 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents had worried that the Valley might lose its place in line for a rail 
project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boisterous Testimony 
</P>
<P>
After four hours of public testimony, much of it boisterous, from a crowd of 
about 300, commissioners voted to proceed with the state-mandated study with no 
major changes to the route options that they approved in September. 
</P>
<P>
Routes under consideration in the $2.1-million study are the Ventura Freeway's 
southern shoulder from the planned Universal City Metro Rail subway station to 
Warner Center, and a Southern Pacific railroad right of way that parallels 
Chandler and Victory boulevards from Metro Rail's planned northern terminus on 
Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood to Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
Both routes are being studied either as Metro Rail extensions or as light-rail 
lines requiring passengers bound for downtown to change trains at the Universal 
City or North Hollywood Metro Rail stations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the freeway route is being studied as a fully elevated line and as 
an elevated line in commercial areas with a subway in residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
Also to be studied are residential portions of the Chandler-Victory route 
either as a full subway or with track in a shallow trench surrounded by 4-foot 
earthen berms or in a deep trench with a metal grid on top. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bus Transfer 
</P>
<P>
In a change from its September vote, the commission decided Wednesday to study 
the possibility of building a rail line no farther west than the Sepulveda 
Basin at this time. Under that plan, a bus transfer station would be built at 
the basin to feed in passengers from points north and west. 
</P>
<P>
At the behest of County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents most of the 
Valley and is a commission member, commissioners also directed that the report 
consider whether it would be better to use monorail or magnetic-levitation 
technology instead of conventional rail transit. 
</P>
<P>
And the commission, acting on the motion of Mayor Tom Bradley, also a 
commissioner, agreed to forgo consideration of federal aid for a Metro Rail 
extension across the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley argued that the federal study process is so complex that it "could 
unnecessarily delay the decision on Valley rail transit for at least five 
years." 
</P>
<P>
The commission's decision not to seek federal funding, which staff members said 
would be difficult to secure in any case, left unanswered the question of how 
the commission would pay for most of the route options being studied. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which is building the Long Beach-Los Angeles and Century 
Freeway light-rail lines, has about $800 million available to build one more 
rail line before the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Cost estimates for proposed Valley options range from $900 million for a 
shallow-trenched line along the Chandler-Victory route to $3 billion for the 
freeway option that would be subway in residential areas and elevated in 
commercial areas, the commission staff said. 
</P>
<P>
However, halting construction in the Sepulveda Basin reduces the estimates to 
$500 million for an all-elevated freeway line, $1.7 billion for a part-subway, 
part-elevated freeway line and $1.5 billion for a part-subway, part-elevated 
line along Chandler-Victory. 
</P>
<P>
Most rail proponents at the downtown hearing represented the business 
community. They argued that congestion is strangling the Valley and that polls 
show wide support for an east-west line. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner opponents said they would favor any line that did not intrude into 
their neighborhoods. They said trains running as often as every three minutes 
would bring intolerable noise and congestion to their streets. 
</P>
<P>
They said an all-subway line would be acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to see it. We don't want to hear it. We don't want to feel it," 
said Julie Fine, a West Valley crusader against rail. 
</P>
<P>
But David Fleming, president of the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., warned 
of the high cost of the subway, saying, "Don't kill this by making it 
financially impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders said state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) is expected to 
reintroduce legislation that would all but force the commission to build a 
cross-Valley line and to place it as a subway in residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, interviewed by telephone from Sacramento Wednesday, said that he has 
had trouble getting all parties to agree on details and that it is "conceivable 
but not likely" that he will abandon the legislative effort. 
</P>
<P>
Commission staff members said they expect a draft version of the study, which 
will specify the costs and ridership estimates for each option, to be available 
by October. 
</P>
<P>
Rival routes, for which studies are nearly complete, are a Pasadena-to-downtown 
line and a northern extension of the Century Freeway line past Los Angeles 
International Airport to Marina del Rey.

REDONDO BEACH VOTE LEAVES DOERR, ALLIES SMILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I can't stop smiling," said Redondo Beach Mayor Barbara Doerr as dozens of 
well-wishers gathered at her home to help celebrate her victory Tuesday as a 
City Council candidate. 
</P>
<P>
And, indeed, the two-term mayor had much to smile about. The voters of District 
1 had chosen her by a decisive 17% margin over incumbent Councilman John 
Chapman, and on April 1 she will give up her largely ceremonial post and 
realize her wish to become a member of the city's legislative body. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, voters citywide rejected a bid by Doerr's longtime political 
foe, two-term Councilman Archie Snow, to exchange his District 4 seat for the 
mayor's post. 
</P>
<P>
The City Charter prevented Doerr and Snow from seeking a third term in their 
present positions. 
</P>
<P>
The election outcome effectively retired the 70-year-old Snow, who had been 
depicted by Doerr and her allies as an old-style, back-room politician aligned 
with developers. It potentially opened the way for the 45-year-old Doerr -- who 
portrayed herself as an advocate of residents' interests, open government and 
much tighter controls on growth -- to become the leader of a new council 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waiting for Runoff 
</P>
<P>
However, the makeup of the new council -- and Doerr's successor as mayor -- 
will not be determined until the May 16 runoff election, because none of the 
candidates, except Doerr, received more than 50% of the vote in their races. 
</P>
<P>
Two other council candidates endorsed by Doerr -- real estate appraiser Michael 
F. Ford in District 2 and school Trustee Valerie Dombrowski in District 4 -- 
led their opponents by narrow margins. But they failed to win election because 
an inactive candidate in each race absorbed a small but critical percentage of 
the votes cast. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, 38, received 787 votes (48.1%) against incumbent Kay Horrell's 696 
(42.5%), while Neil Nathanson, who dropped out of the race nearly two months 
ago, got 154 (9.4%). 
</P>
<P>
Dombrowski, 53, got 465 votes (49.7%) in District 4, compared to 417 (44.6%) 
for Terry Ward, 51, a data processing consultant and the candidate endorsed by 
Snow. Barry Ogle, another inactive candidate whose name remained on the ballot, 
got 54 votes (5.8%). 
</P>
<P>
In the mayoral contest, which had five candidates, the runoff will be held 
between Brad Parton, a 28-year-old investment counselor, and Frank Bostrom, 39, 
an architect and community planner. Both campaigned for tighter controls on 
development, and Bostrom was endorsed by Doerr. 
</P>
<P>
Parton, who billed himself as an independent, energetic newcomer who could work 
successfully with Doerr and her allies, received 1,726 votes, or 25.2% of 6,850 
ballots cast citywide. Bostrom, who called for higher building standards and 
the preservation of recreational space, got 1,639 votes, or 24%. 
</P>
<P>
Snow came in third for mayor with 21.6%, missing his shot at the runoff by 166 
votes. John Dancy was a close fourth with 21.4%, and Steve Bopp got 8.1%. Voter 
turnout citywide was 19.3%, slighter higher than the average in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The council will pick an acting mayor from among its members on April 1 to 
serve until Doerr's successor is elected in the runoff. Under Redondo Beach's 
novel system, the mayor presides over council meetings but has no vote except 
in case of a tie. The mayor has veto power but can be overridden by four votes 
on the five-member council. 
</P>
<P>
That became almost a ritual during Doerr's tenure as mayor, when she often 
found herself opposing a four-member majority -- Snow, Chapman, Horrell and 
District 5 Councilman Ron Cawdrey. 
</P>
<P>
If voters in the runoff election fulfill the rest of Doerr's wishes, she could 
potentially take over Snow's old role and assume leadership of a new council 
majority -- herself, Ford, Dombrowski and District 3 Councilman Stevan Colin, 
who has been her only council ally since his election a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Responsive' 
</P>
<P>
"We will be working for our candidates," Doerr said Tuesday night. "I think the 
voters will find that we are more responsive to the wishes of residents." 
</P>
<P>
However, Horrell and Ward were close on the heels of their council rivals in 
Tuesday's election and are expected to wage strong campaigns to pull ahead in 
the May runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman, a county regional planner who was opposed by Doerr in his bid for a 
second term in District 1, could not be reached Wednesday for comment. He 
received 775 votes, or 41.7%, compared to Doerr's 1,080, or 58.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Snow, in an elegiac mood as his long career as a dominant force in city 
politics came to an end, said Wednesday: "Of course, I feel bad, but I'm not 
crushed. I'll still be around. . . . Watching City Hall is second nature to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blames Heart Surgery 
</P>
<P>
Snow, a retired mechanical engineer who was active in city affairs long before 
his election to the council in 1981, attributed his loss Tuesday to heart 
surgery in January that largely sidelined him during the crucial last months of 
the campaign and to his opponents' success in labeling him as an aging, 
old-style politician who is out of tune with the city's needs. 
</P>
<P>
"But I have no regrets, no excuses, and I wish the best to the winners," he 
said. "I had eight good years on the council, and I enjoyed every minute of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Gordon Phillips was reelected to a third term without opposition. 
Voters also approved three ballot measures by wide margins.

COUNSELING FOR TEENS FUNDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Bay Hospital District has established a $100,000 fund to provide more 
counseling for troubled teen-agers in Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and 
Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The fund, approved by the district board for a year, will supplement financial 
support for counseling already provided by the cities, the state and Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The fund will be administered by South Bay Juvenile Diversion, an agency set up 
by South Bay cities to evaluate teens in need of counseling and refer them to 
individual therapists or community agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Just over $42,000 of the fund will be used to pay for individual and group 
counseling by Project Touch, a private, nonprofit counseling service in Hermosa 
Beach, said Philip Valera, executive director of the hospital district. He said 
about 500 teen-agers will be helped during the next year.

MALL BUILDER PAYS DEPOSIT OF $1 MILLION TO BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Burbank City Council, acting as the city's Redevelopment Agency, has 
formally agreed to negotiate exclusively with developer Alexander Haagen to 
build a downtown shopping mall that could cost as much as $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement, Haagen, a major developer of malls in Southern 
California, paid a "good-faith" deposit of $1 million to the city. The deposit 
will be applied toward the purchase price or lease payment for the proposed 
shopping center site. 
</P>
<P>
Haagen is also giving the city an additional $500,000 to pay the city's costs 
in negotiating an agreement and preparing environmental studies on the project. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, announced Tuesday, marks the latest step in Burbank's plan to 
have a major shopping mall within the city limits. The city has tried 
unsuccessfully to develop a mall on 41 acres near the Civic Center, but 
projects proposed by several developers have fallen through. 
</P>
<P>
Haagen has proposed building the Burbank Gateway Center, a 1.4 
million-square-foot project to include a two-level mall, offices, hotels and 
restaurants. The shopping center will be anchored by the Ikea furniture store, 
as well as Buffums, Mervyn's and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. department stores. 
The site is at Magnolia and Burbank boulevards near the Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Community Development officials said the city will negotiate details of the 
proposal, including how much the project will cost, in the next 30 to 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
If the council approves the concept and details, an environmental review of the 
project will be conducted. After that, a final plan would be brought before the 
council.

PLEAS ENTERED IN SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two former Torrance police officers, fired after the accidental shooting last 
year of an unarmed suspect, pleaded not guilty Wednesday in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court to charges that they gave false accounts of the incident to 
their superiors. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Pappas, 27, and Mark Holden, 30, are free on $2,500 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Each is charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice and conspiracy to falsely 
charge another with a crime. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to 
three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Pappas and Holden were fired from the Torrance Police Department after the May 
9 shooting of Patrick J. Coyle, 30. Pappas fired a single shot that struck 
Coyle in the chin and lodged in the back of his skull, leaving him partially 
paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
Pappas and Holden, who arrived in a second squad car to provide backup, said 
Coyle made a sudden movement that provoked the shooting, according to Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Christopher Darden. In fact, Coyle was unarmed and did not move 
before the shooting, Darden said. 
</P>
<P>
Coyle has sued the city, which has admitted liability in the incident. No 
settlement has been reached.

ONE INCUMBENT EASILY WINS, ONE BARELY KEEPS SEAT ON REDONDO SCHOOL BOARD 
</P>

Redondo Beach voters have decided to keep two incumbents on the local school 
board, which is facing renewed proposals for unification and efforts to improve 
what is generally viewed as a superior school system. 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Sargent easily won reelection to a third term on the Redondo Beach City 
School District Board of Trustees with 3,662 votes, or 38.1%. 
</P>
<P>
However, board President Howard Huizing scratched out a thin eight-vote win 
over Andrew Deliman in the contest for the second of two seats. Both men are 
retired educators, who served in the city's elementary school district for many 
years as principals. Huizing received 2,975 votes, or 31% of the total cast, 
compared to 2,967 for Deliman, or 30.9%. 
</P>
<P>
In the low-key campaign, all three candidates spoke glowingly of how well 
almost everything is going in the district and found few issues on which they 
could disagree. 
</P>
<P>
All three said they liked the idea of Redondo Beach forming its own school 
system for the city's elementary and high school students. Deliman focused on 
that solution, however, while the two incumbents said they would keep open 
minds until other possibilities have been explored. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach officials will be host of a joint meeting Tuesday to discuss 
those possibilities with the boards of elementary districts in Manhattan Beach 
and Hermosa Beach and with the trustees of the South Bay Union High School 
District, which serves the secondary students in the three beach cities. 
</P>
<P>
The 3,300-student high school district, where sharp drops in enrollment have 
produced budget crunches in recent years, has suggested a consolidation of 
schools in all three cities into one large system. 
</P>
<P>
Another outcome may be separate unified districts in Redondo Beach and 
Manhattan Beach, with the smaller, one-school Hermosa Beach system joining one 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its financial problems, South Bay Union officials reject 
characterizations of the district as "troubled." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to The Times this week, board President Noel Palm acknowledged that 
the district faces budget deficits in the next two years, but said it can 
weather the period by using money from the sale of Aviation High School. 
</P>
<P>
He said enrollment should stabilize by the 1991-92 school year. Meanwhile, he 
said, the district's two high schools have been recognized again by the 
California Department of Education as "among the best in the state." BOB 
WILLIAMS

SDSU GOES DOWN FIGHTING . . . ITSELF; 
</P>
<P>
WITH ROSS BANISHED TO BENCH AT END, UTAH BUMPS AZTECS FROM TOURNAMENT

<P>
In a season marked by controversy, maybe it was only fitting that the final 
game for this San Diego State basketball team should end with at least one 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Ross, the team's second-leading scorer and best outside shooter, was 
benched for disciplinary reasons in the final minutes of a 70-57 loss to host 
Utah Wednesday night in the preliminary game of the Western Athletic Conference 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Ross spent the final 4:23 on the bench after apparently getting into a 
disagreement with Coach Jim Brandenburg. 
</P>
<P>
Ross left with the Aztecs trailing, 62-53, and the game still within their 
grasp. But the Utes (16-16) scored eight of the final 12 points to eliminate 
SDSU (12-17) and earn the right to meet regular-season champion Colorado State 
in the quarterfinals tonight at Huntsman Center. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, a junior who scored 12 of his team-high 14 points in the first half, 
would not discuss the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"If I said something, it would be the wrong thing," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg would only say that "we had a little discussion." 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg and Ross have had their public disagreements throughout the season. 
The two exchanged words several times last week during games at New Mexico and 
Texas El Paso, and Brandenburg kept Ross on the bench at times during both 
games. But not until the latest incident did Brandenburg take such an extreme 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to bench Ross was the latest and the last in what had been 
season-long struggle for Brandenburg and his team. Before the game, Brandenburg 
imposed his rule again, replacing senior forward Shawn Bell in the starting 
lineup with freshman Dana Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg called the move a "coach's decision" but did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to not start Bell was not the only adjustment Brandenburg had to 
make. William Dixion, a junior walk-on guard, returned to Los Angeles Wednesday 
morning to be with his ailing grandmother and missed the game. That left the 
Aztecs with only three guards -- Ross, junior walk-on Kevin Honaker and junior 
Rodney Jones, who played despite pregame nausea. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all their troubles, the Aztecs found a way to stay with Utah, even 
though it appeared that their cause might be lost from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
The Utes scored the first seven points in a start reminiscent of their 15-0 
opening in an 80-61 regular-season victory over the Aztecs atHuntsman. But this 
time, the Aztecs rallied to take the lead by scoring the next eight points and 
went on to take lead by as much as 21-15 with 7:40 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs' cause was not hurt by the sparse crowd of 5,508, Utah's smallest 
since 5,017 attended a Dec. 12, 1975, game against Denver, that had come to 
watch the game between the tournament's two lowest-seeded teams. Utah came back 
to outscore the Aztecs, 19-7, to take a 34-28 lead at halftime. But SDSU was 
still in the game, thanks in many ways to Ross, who had one of his best 
statistical halves of the season: 12 points, six rebounds, three assists, three 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony did did some nice things for us," Brandenburg said. "I can't fault his 
play at all." 
</P>
<P>
But even when Ross cooled off in the second half and center Mitch McMullen, who 
had 10 first-half points, found himself surrounded by a collapsing defense that 
limited him to three points in the second, the Aztecs stayed close. 
</P>
<P>
They trailed by two (51-49) with as little as 8:21 to play before, according to 
Brandenburg and the players, their lack of depth finally caught up with them. 
</P>
<P>
"We were tired, and they were pushing the ball down our throats," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Utah went on an 11-2 streak to take a 62-53 lead with 5:54 to play. Soon after, 
Ross and Brandenburg had the disagreement that prematurely ended Ross' season. 
The end for the last-place Aztecs came a few minutes later; it was their 
earliest exit in the tournament's six-year history. 
</P>
<P>
The game was a snapshot of what went wrong for the Aztecs the later half of the 
season. They made a tournament-record 22 turnovers, including nine by Bell, who 
ended up playing 29 minutes. They were mediocre from the free-throw line (nine 
of 18). They had difficulty defending perimeter shooting -- freshman forward 
Josh Grant of Utah scored a game-high 19 points, including three 
three-pointers. And there was internal turmoil on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"We went through a lot this year," Jones said. "Hopefully the guys comingback 
will know how it was, and they will listen to the coaches more, have more 
desire. We had it this year; we just couldn't put it together at times." 
</P>
<P>
Aztecs Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mitch McMullen finished his San Diego State career with a record he would have 
liked to avoid. His two fouls gave him 110, breaking by two the seasonrecord 
set by Rodney Hawkins last year. . . . The 22 turnovers broke the Western 
Athletic Conference tournament record of 20 set by Hawaii against Utah in 1984 
and were one short of the season high set in a 77-72 loss at Arizona State.

NO FIST IN HIS GLOVE; 
</P>
<P>
JOEY CORA DOESN'T WANT TO FIGHT; HE WANTS A CHANCE 
</P>

Among other things, one sign that you have become a big league baseball player 
is that you no longer have a stranger's signature in your glove. There are no 
Willie Mays Models here, no Mickey Mantle Special Editions, no Pee Wee Reese 
Limiteds. 
</P>
<P>
Big leaguers are contractually bound to prefer nothing fancier on their defense 
weapons than "Rawlings" or "Wilson" or whoever is paying them. That is, most 
big leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
One exception is Padre infielder Joey Cora. His glove is a Wayne Gretzky model. 
</P>
<P>
In the dugout before Wednesday's exhibition game with the San Francisco Giants, 
Cora grabs his glove, turns it over and points to some faded blue script near 
the back. 
</P>
<P>
"See that?" he asks. "That's Wayne Gretzky's signature. You know what I had to 
go through to get that? We're playing a minor league game in Edmonton, and I 
see him in the stands, and while we are batting, I send it over to get it 
signed. He got it back to me just before I have to go back on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey man, this is a big deal. This is worth some money." 
</P>
<P>
The point is not the big deal or the money, which is negligible considering the 
glove is so old and cracked that it looks like gardening glove. The point is 
that Joey Cora would proudly adorn it with a signature of one of sport's better 
contradictions: a famous hockey player who is outspoken against fighting. 
</P>
<P>
"That's me," said Cora, who will turn 24 this season. "I don't like to fight. I 
am not a fighter. I don't even like people yelling at me. I am sensitive, I 
know I am. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I wonder, if I am tougher, would things have been any different? I 
don't know, but I never know, because I can never change." 
</P>
<P>
Everything else changes, though. And here, two springs after he was everybody's 
phenom, everybody's baby, Joey Cora sits, alone. His career, which has spanned 
four seasons in four different leagues and has included 54 games as a 
big-league starter, has come down to three words, which he utters with feeling: 
</P>
<P>
"So now what?" 
</P>
<P>
He had his chance to fight, in 1987, against the ragings of then-Manager Larry 
Bowa, for whom this rookie second baseman was never good enough. Bowa brought 
him to the big leagues from double-A and made him the Opening Day starter. 
Anyone who heard the screaming from San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium knows the 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
"It was terrible," Cora said. "Larry says so much, all the time, I did not want 
to come to the ballpark. And when I get there, I don't want to be there. 
</P>
<P>
"I get so down and lonely, I go home every night and try to cook, to help me 
forget." 
</P>
<P>
He had his chance, but he did not fight. He was quietly sent to triple-A Las 
Vegas on June 8 hitting just .234 with only 12 RBIs and at least as many mental 
mistakes. He was obviously not ready for the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it," Bowa said last year, "and Joey knew it." 
</P>
<P>
Cora finished out the triple-A season, played in 23 more big-league games 
following a September recall, then spent all of last year again in triple-A. By 
then, Roberto Alomar had established himself as the Padre second baseman for 
little less than his life span. And Cora could not fight. 
</P>
<P>
So here he sits this spring, coming off a fine, all-star season in Las Vegas -- 
.296 hitting, great fielding -- and coming off the best Puerto Rican winter 
league season of his life, an all-star winter with a .303 average. 
</P>
<P>
So here he sits, despite all that, hoping just to make the Padres as a utility 
man, hoping harder that he is traded somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
So now what? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what's going on, I have no idea anymore," Cora said Wednesday 
before entering the Padres' 8-6 loss to San Francisco in the eighth inning, 
just in time to draw a walk and score the Padres' final run. He is hitting .333 
this spring (3 for 9) with an RBI, and he has looked good in the field, with 
his only error coming on a low relay throw. 
</P>
<P>
But while Bip Roberts, the other Padre utility infield candidate, has played a 
couple of positions, Cora has played only second. Considering that a couple of 
teams have asked about acquiring him, including the Chicago White Sox, he 
figures this may mean he has been showcased for a trade. 
</P>
<P>
"If I am going to be a utility man here, you would think I would play third 
base and shortstop some," he said. "It looks like I may just be playing for the 
man in the stands (scouts). That is fine, whatever, I will play wherever." 
</P>
<P>
And not fight it. That is the most curious thing about Cora, this lack of spite 
toward an organization that rushed him, this lack of anger toward the memory of 
Larry Bowa. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't hate Larry Bowa," he said in answer to the first and most obvious 
question of all his interviews these days. "What good does it do to hate 
people? I look back, and I understand what Larry was going through. In a 
different way, he was going through the same thing as me. He was a rookie, he 
was trying to prove himself, he got frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
No, Cora said, he has not talked to Bowa since being sent down in June of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"But it doesn't matter, because whenever we talked, he talked, I didn't talk," 
Cora said. "I will talk to him if I ever get a chance. I just don't know what 
I'd say." 
</P>
<P>
He does know he wouldn't curse him or berate him or get any ideas about taking 
a swing at him. 
</P>
<P>
"You got to understand," Cora said. "I don't even hate the guy who stabbed me." 
</P>
<P>
Many remember the incident in 1986 when Cora, playing for double-A Beaumont, 
was stabbed in the stomach during a parking lot fight outside the stadium in 
San Antonio. The fight started because some thugs were messing with the team 
bus. There was much written about it and about Cora's eight-week recovery from 
ensuing surgery and how he made the big leagues the following year in spite of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
What may have been lost in the fuss, though, was that on that night in San 
Antonio, Cora decided he would never fight again. 
</P>
<P>
"That taught me a good lesson about minding your own business and keeping a low 
profile," Cora said. "That really affected me for a long time. I see Stanley 
Jefferson fighting with Larry Bowa the next year and I think, forget it, I 
fight no guys, I just do what they tell me." 
</P>
<P>
So here he sits, perhaps good enough to start another big league season with 
someone but wondering if maybe one chance isn't all you ever get. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, so maybe he came up before he should have, he's still so young," Manager 
Jack McKeon said. "How many years has he been in triple-A, not even two? He 
should ask some other guys around here about playing in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried about Joey. We've got time to do a lot of things with him." 
</P>
<P>
And when he does get another chance, and the manager happens to be someone like 
Larry Bowa? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I'd do," Cora said evenly. "Just hope that doesn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Ed Whitson was rocked for five runs on six hits in four innings of 
Wednesday's 8-6 loss to San Francisco. This included back-to-back homers by 
Kevin Mitchell and Candy Maldonado. But Whitson said he felt fine and had no 
numbness in fingers, something that bothered him last season. "The trainers 
thumb out (massage) the nerves in my arm before I go out there, and I am fine," 
Whitson said. "The problem today was just a couple of pitches that got away." . 
. . A real problem for the Padres appears to be the left side of their infield, 
which committed two more errors Wednesday (Carlos Baerga, Mike Brumley) to give 
that side 10 errors in six games. "That's not getting by me," said Manager Jack 
McKeon, who will increase his efforts this week to find a power-hitting third 
baseman and may still settle on Seattle's Jim Presley if others are included in 
the deal. For the record, shortstop Brumley has committed three errors, 
shortstop Gary Green has committed two errors, shortstop Garry Templeton has 
committed one error. Third baseman Randy Ready has committed three errors, and 
Baerga blew his first one Wednesday. . . . The ones most effected by this are 
Brumley and Green, who are fighting for the backup shortstop job. Brumley 
entered camp as a virtual lock; Green wasn't even invited until the last 
minute. But now the race seems to be even, and McKeon wants to take the one 
with the best defense, which right now is Green. "I'm not making a choice, but 
I'd like to have a defensive player there," McKeon said. . . . McKeon said his 
regulars will begin playing as a unit Sunday in Mesa against the Chicago Cubs. 
By the time the club returns to Yuma at the end of next week, he said, the 
regulars would play two out of every three games.

SAN FERNANDO FIGHTS TO WIN IN TOURNAMENT TITLE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In a manner of speaking, it all boiled down to first base. 
</P>
<P>
That is, St. Francis High had plenty of trouble getting anyone there, and when 
it did, there was trouble of the first order. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando defeated St. Francis, 11-4, in the championship game of the La 
Canada tournament Wednesday night at La Canada High in a 2-hour, 58-minute game 
that was marred by a bench-clearing brawl in the top of the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando (3-0) took a 7-0 lead in the first and, with right-hander Frank 
Serna in control, St. Francis managed only two hits in the first 3 1/3innings. 
The Tigers held a 10-0 lead with one out in the fourth, when the game turned 
from rout to riot. 
</P>
<P>
St Francis' Matt Jones, attempting to beat out a ground ball to third, ran into 
first baseman John Najar, knocking the San Fernando player to the ground. Najar 
got a glove on the ball, which rolled into foul territory. 
</P>
<P>
Jones attempted to scramble back to the bag and became entangled with Najar, 
who appeared to have tried to trip Jones on his way back. The pair tackled each 
other, and seconds later, the benches cleared and several other skirmishes 
broke out. 
</P>
<P>
Najar and Jones were ejected and there was a 15-minute delay as tournament 
officials and umpires decided whether to continue. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, two squad cars from the L. A. Sheriff's Department waited in 
the parking lot to keep the peace. 
</P>
<P>
St. Francis' Manny Fernandez, who was on the bench when the fight broke out, 
picked up a bloody nose after joining the melee. He returned to the bench and 
grabbed a bat, turned around and headed toward a tangled pile of players before 
he was forcibly restrained by several teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened had nothing to do with baseball," St. Francis Coach Tom Moran 
said. "It's not good for baseball, it's not good for either school. 
</P>
<P>
Moran said he "will discipline any player who left the bench," and that 
Fernandez, like many others in the brawl, simply lost control. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just out of it," Moran said. "He had a bloody nose, and he was just not 
thinking straight. Believe me, I will take care of anyone who came off the 
bench." 
</P>
<P>
Najar suffered a badly bruised eye, and even Serna took a blow to the head. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad this had to happen, because it really takes away from some good 
performances by a couple of our kids," said San Fernando Coach Steve Marden, 
who had little chance to enjoy the first tournament victory in his 11 years at 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
Serna (2-0) was almost unhittable in his five innings on the mound, allowing no 
runs on two hits. The senior struck out five and walked one before leaving in 
the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"He had done what we wanted," Marden said. "It was already 10-zip at that 
point, and besides, his eye was starting to swell up." 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando (3-0) received most of its offense from senior shortstop Bobby 
Corrales, who had four hits in five at-bats. Corrales drove in the first run in 
the first inning, as the Tigers rocked Knights' right-hander Erik Hagge for 
seven runs in one-third of an inning. 
</P>
<P>
"He just never got untracked," Moran said of Hagge. "Of course, they had a lot 
to do with that. That's a very good high school baseball team." 
</P>
<P>
Corrales finished with five runs batted in. St. Francis did not score until the 
seventh, when it spanked San Fernando reliever Jess Vasquez for four runs.

NCAA DIVISION II SWIMMING CHAMPIONSHIP;

NORTHRIDGE MEN HAPPY WITH A TIE FOR FOURTH

<P>
There was a time, not so many years ago, when a fourth-place finish by the Cal 
State Northridge men's swimming and diving team would have sent Coach Pete 
Accardy belly-flopping off the high dive in despair. 
</P>
<P>
Not anymore. After the opening day of the NCAA Division II nationals Wednesday 
at State University of New York at Buffalo, the Matador men were quite content 
to take a place behind Cal State Bakersfield, Oakland (Mich.) and UC Davis in 
the team standings. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge may not hold its perch, but it appears that the once-mighty Matadors 
won't sink as far as Accardy had feared. 
</P>
<P>
A top 10 finish -- something CSUN has accomplished in each of Accardy's 19 
seasons as coach -- seems fairly secure. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge and Chico State have 35 points. Missouri-St. Louis is 10th, 24 
points behind the Matadors. Bakersfield, which is in search of its fourth 
consecutive championship, leads with 131 points. Oakland has 93 and UC Davis 
36. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hanging in there," Accardy said. "All things considered, I'll be happy 
if we're in the top 10." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it will be small consolation compared to what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, which won nine titles from 1975-85, had slipped behind both 
Bakersfield and Oakland in the past three national meets. But based on this 
season's early results, Accardy said privately that a return to the top was 
possible if certain things fell into place. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, things fell apart. First went the personnel -- one swimmer was kicked 
off the squad and nine others were ruled academically ineligible. Then the pool 
itself was plagued with maintenance problems. 
</P>
<P>
The team had been able to overcome such obstacles in previous seasons, but not 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done the impossible for so long that at some point it has to catch up 
with us," said Accardy, who had never had more than one scholarship to split 
among his team members. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been awful successful for a long time and really the support in the 
whole community hasn't been fitting to what our team has done," Accardy said. 
"We win championship after championship and basically our program stays status 
quo. We have the same problems -- like the pool, for instance -- year after 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's top performance Wednesday came from Tim Arnold, who was fourth in 
the 500-yard freestyle. Arnold's time of 4:33.05 was a lifetime best, but the 
senior said that he will leave the meet a bit disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the meet is going right now, the team we started the year with would 
definitely have had a shot of winning," Arnold said. "I swam my best, but I'd 
rather we win a national title than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
While Arnold closed his collegiate career on an up note, freshman John 
Kunishima made a successful debut. 
</P>
<P>
Kunishima was fifth in the 200-yard individual medley with a personal best of 
1:52.34. 
</P>
<P>
If only he could have called it a race halfway through. Kunishima led after the 
butterfly and backstroke portions of the race but faltered in the breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
"I was right where I wanted to be," Kunishima said. "The last 50 (yards) I just 
broke down a little. The last turn killed me. I usually have a great freestyle, 
but that was not the case." 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield freshman Kristian Bruggert led a Roadrunner sweep of the top three 
places in the medley. His time of 1:50.81 was only a half-second shy of the 
Division II record set last year by Oakland's Mark Vandermey.

WESTLAKE MVP CUT FROM BASEBALL TEAM APPEALS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Craig Cooper, the most valuable player on the Westlake High baseball team last 
season, is appealing to officials of the Conejo Valley Unified School District 
for reinstatement after he was cut from the team Feb. 23, Cooper's father said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Herman Cooper, the appeal is based on the grounds that his son was 
dismissed from the team because of a lingering emotional disorder and not 
because of his performance on the field. Cooper added that he has retained an 
attorney and will file a lawsuit against Rich Herrera, the Westlake coach who 
cut Craig. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, who batted .351 with 27 hits last season as a junior, suffered a "manic 
episode" in August, according to Herman Cooper, and was treated with medication 
under a doctor's care. Craig discontinued use of the medication, however, and 
suffered a relapse in November. 
</P>
<P>
"During his recovery period Craig decided he didn't need the medication and 
regressed," Herman Cooper said. "The coach turned his back on Craig and made 
Craig feel really crummy. 
</P>
<P>
"As he was coming back from his illness, it was a confusing time for him." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper had sporadic attendance at school and baseball classes during the fall 
semester because of the illness, his father said. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera, a first-year walk-on coach, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake Athletic Director Bob Fisher said that he supported Herrera's right to 
cut Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
"The coach has the prerogative as to the make-up of his team," Fisher said. "A 
lot of kids get cut every year. And I get a lot of calls about it -- that's not 
unusual." 
</P>
<P>
Herman Cooper said that Carol Erie, the district's director of secondary 
education, has heard the case and will render a decision by Friday. If the 
decision is unfavorable, Cooper said that he would appeal to the 
superintendent's office. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid has been devastated," Cooper said. "He's been in his room. He's 
withdrawn. I don't know what we're going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Craig, a 6-foot-1, 185-pound center fielder, led the team with six home runs 
and had 19 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"The coach has a right to do whatever he wants," Herman Cooper said. "But a 
senior doesn't get the benefit of the doubt when he produced as he did as a 
junior?"

SAUGUS BATTLES CRESPI TO A TIE BUT ADVANCES ON BASIS OF TOTAL BASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Total bases. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus High totaled 23 to Crespi's 18 in Wednesday's third-round game of the El 
Segundo tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Why the concern over total bases? Because based on the five-base edge, Saugus 
will advance to the fifth-place bracket of the tournament, while Crespi drops 
into the running for ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The game at Saugus was halted because of darkness with the score tied, 1-1, 
after nine innings. Coaches Scott Muckey of Crespi (1-1-1) and Doug Worley of 
Saugus (1-1-1) agreed that the outcome would be recorded as a tie but that the 
Centurions would advance by virtue of most total bases. 
</P>
<P>
Neither coach agreed, however, on when the game should have been halted. Muckey 
argued with the home plate umpire that Saugus should not have been allowed a 
final at-bat in the ninth inning. "He said, 'This is it after this 
half-inning,' " Muckey said. "I said, 'If you're going to call it, call it 
now.' " 
</P>
<P>
With dusk settling in, Muckey took it upon himself to offset any edge that 
Crespi may have had. The umpire handed Crespi catcher Kevin Walsh a bone-white 
baseball in the ninth inning, but before the ball reached pitcher Pat Bennett, 
Muckey gave it a shampoo with dirt from the first-base line. 
</P>
<P>
"They were throwing in nice, new, white balls," Muckey said. "I'm not going to 
let them do that." 
</P>
<P>
While the sun shone, so did Saugus senior right-hander Roger Salkeld who, two 
days past his 18th birthday, truly is the man on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld (1-0) struck out a school-record 19 and walked two while pitching a 
three-hitter for his second complete game. Salkeld struck out the side three 
times -- needing only 10 pitches in the first inning. He had eight strikeouts 
after only 37 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased," Muckey said. "Anytime you get a chance to stay in there with 
Roger Salkeld . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld was a strike away from posting a shutout with 14 strikeouts. But third 
baseman Trevor Rice's unsuccessful attempt at a diving catch of Don Calabria's 
low pop fly on the infield grass in the seventh allowed Chris Romero to score 
from second. 
</P>
<P>
"That was my fault," Salkeld said. "I should have had that one." 
</P>
<P>
Crespi starter Chad Nichols went 5 1/3 innings before he was replaced by 
Bennett with the bases loaded in the sixth and the game scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett threw a wild pitch, allowing pinch-runner Andy Nolan to score from 
third, before pitching out of the jam.

HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
WESTMINSTER HOLDS OFF NO. 1 HART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hart High was unable to rally from a five-run deficit in the seventh inning and 
fell to Westminster, 7-4, Wednesday in the quarterfinals of the El Segundo 
baseball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 7-2, the Indians put together a two-run rally on singles by Dave 
Toledo, Chad Miyata and Jay Sanford, and a run-scoring pop foul by Darin 
Tsukashima. The Indians left the bases loaded, however. 
</P>
<P>
Hart (2-1), ranked No. 1 in the Times' Valley poll, scored two runs in the 
first inning when Vasquez followed Migata's double with a home run. Sophomore 
Keith Halcovich (1-1) took the loss. Westminster improved to 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
In other baseball games: 
</P>
<P>
Canyon 9, Chatsworth 6 -- Kevin Backes hit a home run and Sean Nichols picked 
up the victory as Canyon (1-2) upset the Chancellors in a Westside tournament 
game at Chatsworth.

<P>
Nichols gave up three hits and four runs in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
Artesia 3, Westlake 0 -- The Warriors were held to three singles in the 
quarterfinal game of the Westside tournament at Artesia High. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake had runners on first and third with none out in the sixth inning but 
failed to score. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Eby (1-1) took the loss for Westlake (2-1). The left-hander struck out 
four, walked one and gave up three runs in 4 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands 12, Montclair Prep 5 -- Jimmy Davis hit a grand slam in the 
first and Pat Avila added a two-run home run in the second for Channel Islands, 
which led, 9-1, after three innings en route to the third-round victory in the 
Westside tournament game at Montclair Prep. 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs 2, Banning 1 -- Senior left-hander Brian Forth threw only 74 pitches 
in pitching a four-hitter for host Burroughs in the third round of the El 
Segundo tournament. 
</P>

Peck was three for five with two runs batted in and Crocker was two for five 
with an RBI and scored a run for El Camino Real (4-0), the defending City 
Section champion. 
</P>
<P>
La Reina 20, Santa Clara 0 -- Junior right-hander Sherri Sisco threw a 
no-hitter and struck out 12 in the nonleague game at La Reina that was called 
after five innings because of the 10-run rule. 
</P>
<P>
Sisco also had two hits, scored three runs and knocked in three as the Regents 
collected eight hits. 
</P>

SIMI VALLEY CAPITALIZES ON 8 ERRORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That El Segundo High's talent pool appears to be a little dry this season took 
none of the luster off Simi Valley's 7-4 win over the Eagles on Wednesday at 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
That El Segundo made eight errors took nothing away from the Pioneers' 11 hits 
and four-run fifth inning that won the game. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it even served as a reminder that the best of programs run aground on 
occasion, especially given that only one El Segundo letterman returned from 
last season's Pioneer League co-champion. But Simi Valley's program seems to be 
intact, given its 4-0 start and subsequent berth in the El Segundo tournament 
semifinals Friday against Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
"I see good things," said Kenny Hood, whose two-run home run in the fifth 
inning gave the Pioneers a 5-4 lead they never relinquished. "I have a lot of 
confidence. One through nine (in the batting order) can hit the ball out of the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
"To come out with the wins gives us confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Coming out of the El Segundo tournament with confidence is a plan Simi Valley 
has employed since 1983, when it first played in the season-opening event. The 
Pioneers won the championship in 1985, and, according to Coach Mike Scyphers, 
have never lost more than one game in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We put a lot of emphasis on the tournament," Scyphers said. "By playing, you 
get more games early and the kids need the competition. It's not the same as 
you do in practice." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not for Simi Valley, but El Segundo Coach John Stevenson, whose program 
has nurtured the likes of George and Ken Brett and Tracy and Heath Jones, saw a 
game like this one coming. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of Simi Valley's runs were earned and the Eagles committed three 
errors in the third inning, two in each of the fourth and fifth innings and 
another in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo errors led to two Pioneer runs in the third, one in the fourth and 
four in the fifth. It might have been worse had would-be home runs by Terry 
Hill and Mike Morano not been ruled foul by the plate umpire. The ball Hill 
hit, especially, appeared to clear the fence several feet in fair territory. 
</P>
<P>
Hill still finished with two hits, and Andy Hodgins and Greg Santos each added 
two hits in support of Rich Langford's five-hitter. Langford (2-0) struck out 
four and walked six.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: MAC IICX -- THE CORE OF THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lawrence J. Magid , LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
analyst and writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Apple Macintosh personal computer was introduced in 1984, it was 
regarded as something of a toy computer. It attracted its share of enthusiasts 
who loved its graphics and ease of use, but for the most part, business buyers 
weren't impressed and early sales were sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Apple has upgraded the machine regularly and has sold more than 
2 million Macs. Along the way, the company has upgraded the computer 
considerably and won a much wider array of customers, including many 
universities, engineering firms and other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Apple unveiled its eighth member of the Macintosh family, the 
Macintosh IIcx. Although it isn't a breakthrough product, the machine is small, 
quiet and less expensive than similarly equipped earlier models. 
</P>
<P>
The new Macintosh is controlled by the Motorola 68030 central processing unit, 
the same one used in two other recently introduced Macs, the IIx and the SE/30. 
This high-performance chip lets the new Macs run about 15% faster than the 
original Mac II. More important, the new CPU has "memory management" circuitry 
that will enhance the computer's ability to run several programs at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Like the IIx and SE/30, the new Mac comes with a floppy disk drive that can 
read and write 3 1/2-inch disks formatted for the IBM compatible MS-DOS 
operating system. That makes it possible for the Mac to exchange data with IBM 
Personal System/2 machines, most laptops and many other IBM compatibles. Unless 
specially equipped, the new Macs cannot run IBM software, but they can access 
the same spreadsheets, word processing documents and other data files. 
</P>
<P>
In the tradition of the Mac II, the new machine has expansion slots so that 
users can easily add additional equipment such as monitors, internal modems or 
cards that accelerate processing speed. To save space and reduce costs, Apple 
has equipped the new machine with three, instead of six, expansion slots. That 
limits the ability to add accessories to the machine, but for the near future 
at least, three slots should be more than adequate for most users. 
</P>
<P>
The required monitor adapter card takes up one slot, but there currently are 
few uses for additional expansion cards. You can load up to eight megabytes of 
internal memory without using additional slots. And, as with all Macs, there 
are several built-in "ports," or sockets, that allow you to plug in equipment 
such as a modem, printer, extra hard disk drive or compact disc drive without 
using slots or even removing the cover. 
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing, though, Apple Chief Executive John Sculley predicted that 
the physical design of the IIcx is likely to become a mainstay for the 
Macintosh line, suggesting that the same design would be used for future 
machines. If that is true, we can expect a plethora of add-in boards from 
hardware developers for upgrading the new Macs. That someday could make the 
machine's limited number of slots a frustration to computer users. 
</P>
<P>
The new machine is about a foot wide, 14 inches deep and six inches tall. For 
me, its compact design makes it much more attractive than the larger Mac II or 
IIx. Office space is a precious commodity, and I hate to see it wasted by 
unnecessarily large computers. 
</P>
<P>
The IIcx can be placed vertically or horizontally and can be put on the floor, 
on the desk or even inside a cabinet or drawer. It weighs only 14 pounds and is 
small enough to stuff into an over-the-shoulder bag. Of course, you need a 
monitor, a keyboard and a mouse, so I'd hardly call it transportable. However, 
you could buy an extra monitor and easily carry the machine itself between home 
and work. 
</P>
<P>
I'm hoping that some enterprising company develops a lightweight, flat panel 
display that can be mounted on the unit, turning it into a transportable 
machine. Apple is reportedly planning to release a laptop Mac later this year, 
but it is expected to be very expensive, according to industry insiders. 
</P>
<P>
The new machine is much quieter than earlier models. If you're in a busy 
office, you might not notice the noise from your computer's fan or hard disk. 
But I work in a quiet environment and I hate being forced to listen to noisy 
computers. The Mac II and Mac IIx are too loud for my taste. If you're shopping 
for a new computer, you might want to listen to it in a quiet environment, not 
a noisy showroom, before making your decision. 
</P>
<P>
Like IBM's latest models, the new Mac can be taken apart easily. You loosen one 
screw to remove the cover and, from there, you can remove every component 
without using any tools. Its modular design makes it easy for a technician, or 
even an average computer user, to replace components. 
</P>
<P>
Macintosh computers never are cheap, although they are about the same as 
similarly equipped systems from IBM. But because Apple has patents and 
copyrights that prevent others from copying the Mac, you're not going to see 
cheap "clones," as you do with IBM equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The Macintosh IIcx, with a megabyte of memory and a floppy disk drive, has a 
suggested retail price of $4,669. With a 40-megabyte internal hard disk and an 
Apple monochrome display, you'll pay almost $6,000. And if you want to run more 
than one program at a time, you'll need additional memory. Apple charges $2,000 
for a four-megabyte expansion kit. At the suggested retail price, it would cost 
almost $9,000 for a fully loaded Mac IIcx with four megabytes of internal 
memory, an 80-megabyte hard disk and an Apple color monitor. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Apple does have competition when it comes to memory, disk drives, 
monitors, printers, keyboards and other peripheral equipment. Just as with IBM 
equipment, you can save a lot of money by buying a stripped-down machine and 
shopping around for your other equipment. You might ask if your dealer can put 
together such a hybrid system. Apple won't guarantee other companies' 
equipment, though, so be sure that the store is willing to stand behind such a 
system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MACINTOSH IIcx: THE SPECS 
</P>
<P>
The Macintosh IIcx is a smaller, quieter and less expensive version of the 
Macintosh II personal computer. It can be outfitted with a variety of 
keyboards, monitors and hard disk drives.

JACK SMITH: BETTING HIS STAKE ON THE GOD OF CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While walking along our beach in Baja California some years ago, I suddenly 
realized that God's name was Random Chance. 
</P>
<P>
I duly reported that revelation in this space, and over the years it has 
inspired unceasing correspondence, pro and con. 
</P>
<P>
Now Harriett Luger of Torrance writes that she has always been intrigued by my 
insight because she feels that "by a slight shift of focus" I could have made 
an equally good case for complete predestination. 
</P>
<P>
"What if the very first reaction of the very first particle contained within it 
the blueprint of all the laws of the universe -- physical, chemical, biological 
-- down to the gnat's eyebrow, the direction of every grain of dust. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps if we traced our respective ancestors back to the single-celled 
organism from which we seem to have descended, our living at the same time, my 
reading your column, is not Random Chance, but inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
Luger recalls a recent "Nova" program on Channel 28 about an attempt to study 
chaos systematically. It involved several randomly placed dots and perhaps a 
million throws of a die. She says: "Chance would have dictated a disorganized 
tangle of lines as random numbers came up. What emerged, instead, was a neat 
pattern of triangles forming a pyramid, suggesting that Random Chance has 
design, the ultimate and supreme oxymoron." 
</P>
<P>
I am enchanted by Luger's description of a designing Random Chance as "the 
ultimate and supreme oxymoron," an oxymoron being, as we know, a self- 
contradictory word or phrase. 
</P>
<P>
I am quite at ease with the vision of Random Chance as creating pyramids. After 
all, it has created Michelangelo, Shakespeare, the Empire State Building, the 
Grand Canyon and Myrna Loy. 
</P>
<P>
Luger concludes: "I am in no way campaigning for predestination. I don't 
pretend to know if the future is already in place, waiting to happen, or if we 
are accidents in an accidental universe accidentally continuing." 
</P>
<P>
I realize that we are self-aware, self-contained beings, created and guided by 
our genes, but I do not believe that when we get out on the great skating rink 
of life we are not subject to accidents. If you collide with some slob who 
doesn't know which way he's going, is that preordained? 
</P>
<P>
I possibly lack the intellect to probe this question, but I happen to have, 
coincidentally, a letter from Fallon Evans quoting Mark Twain on the subject of 
"accidental falls." 
</P>
<P>
Evans is currently teaching Twain at Harbor College, he says, "to a class that 
seems more puzzled than amused by his profundities, as for example: 'When the 
German languages gets hold of a cat, it's goodby cat.' " 
</P>
<P>
Twain's metaphysical observations on "accidents" follow: 
</P>
<P>
"There ain't no such thing as an accident. When my Uncle Lem was leaning up 
agin a scaffolding once, sick, or drunk, or sumthin, an Irishman with a hod of 
bricks fell on him out of the third story and broke the old man's back in two 
places. 
</P>
<P>
"People said it was an accident. Much accident there was about that. He didn't 
know what he was there for, but he was there for a good object. If he hadn't 
been there the Irishman would have been killed. Nobody can ever make me believe 
anything different about that. Uncle Lem's dog was there. Why didn't the 
Irishman fall on the dog? Becuz the dog would a seen him a-coming and stood 
from under. That's the reason the dog warn't app'inted. A dog can't be depended 
on to carry out a special prov'dence." 
</P>
<P>
Twain's thesis obviously is that human beings are the playthings of 
predestination, but dogs aren't. 
</P>
<P>
I don't care to argue with the master, but it seems to me we are all in this 
together -- people, dogs, cats, ants and crocodiles. If Random Chance is 
rolling the dice, we are all subject to the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
My position is best set forth by biologist Lewis Thomas in one of his splendid 
essays from the collection, "Late Night Thoughts on Listening to Mahler's Ninth 
Symphony": "What we have been learning in our time is that we really do not 
understand this place or how it works, and we comprehend our own selves least 
of all. And the more we learn, the more we are -- or ought to be -- 
dumbfounded." 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly what Random Chance has made me: Dumbfounded.

MAGAZINES: NEWSWEEK'S SCRAMBLE TO SCOOP TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, Time Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newsweek may be behind in its circulation and ad war with Time, but Newsweek 
editor Maynard Parker is gloating that his magazine was ahead of Time Inc.'s 
entire stable of publications on one of the hottest business stories of the 
year: the pending merger of Time Inc. with Warner Communications Inc., an 
$18-billion deal that would create America's largest media and entertainment 
conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
Newsweek's staff was preparing to put the current issue to bed when the story 
broke on Saturday, Parker said. But because they had kept up with the ongoing 
merger rumors, "when the first flash came over the ticker at 2 or 2:30 on 
Saturday, we were ready to roll." 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we weren't scooped by our own competitor," said Edward Adler, 
spokesman for Time Inc., which owns, among other enterprises, a huge assortment 
of popular and special interest magazines as well as a book publishing 
division, cable television companies and the Home Box Office programming 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, when there's big news about Time Inc. . . . it is covered in the 
'Editor's Notes' or 'Publisher's Notes' columns" of the various publications, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
So, while Newsweek slipped the story into its current issue -- dated March 13 
-- Time Inc.'s coverage will start with the March 20 edition of People. The 
company's other major periodicals -- from Time, Life, Fortune and Money to 
Sports Illustrated -- will follow suit as they are published, Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think any news magazine worth its salt has to publish what is certainly one 
of the biggest business stories of the week," Parker countered. "To ignore the 
story seems to me to be short changing your reader." 
</P>
<P>
In covering the story, Newsweek -- which last year had an average worldwide 
base circulation of about 4 million to Time's 5.6 million, and $242 million in 
advertising revenues compared to Time's $336.6 million -- couldn't resist a few 
easy shots. 
</P>
<P>
"The deal raises intriguing issues in the corporate office, like how Time's 
publications will review Warner films," the article states. "Magazines will 
also lose their traditional place as the flagship and 'soul' of the 66-year-old 
company," the story continues. With the merger, Time becomes "a television 
company -- period," the editor of the trade publication Channels observes. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not true at all," Adler said. "Warner doesn't have magazines, per se, 
and we're not going to change the way we run ours because of this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unaffected by Merger 
</P>
<P>
Time Inc. staffers have been assured that the magazine divisions will be 
unaffected by the merger, Adler said, quoting from a memo written by Time 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer J. Richard Munro: "The traditional 
integrity and independence of Time Inc.'s journalistic voice will be a 
cornerstone of Time Warner Inc. And that voice will continue to make a 
difference to America and the world." 
</P>
<P>
As for the matter of reviewing Warner films, he said: "For years Time magazine 
and People magazine have reviewed (Home Box Office) product. Sometimes they 
praise it and sometimes they pan it. . . . They're under no orders what to 
write about HBO and they certainly wouldn't be about Warner product." 
</P>
<P>
With the merger, Newsweek's Parker expects "magazines will play less of a role 
than they once did (at Time Inc.)." But he doesn't foresee any lessening of 
competition between the two publications. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, while Newsweek took the lead in reporting the merger, Lester 
Bernstein -- a former Newsweek editor who once wrote for Time -- presaged the 
event in a well-timed cover story on Feb. 26 for the New York Times magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Without detailing merger possibilities, he analyzed Time Inc.'s prospects in 
the era of "megatakeovers," and pointed to some apparent ironies regarding 
Time's place in the current market. 
</P>
<P>
For Time founder Henry Luce, journalism always came first, Bernstein writes, 
citing Luce's well-known dictum that in his empire, there would be an absolute 
line separating the "church" of journalism from the "state" of the publishing 
business. 
</P>
<P>
So Luce often resisted diversification, Bernstein writes. "Once he scornfully 
rejected a deal to buy a movie studio, something for which the company now 
hungers. If he had to invest in leisure, he jeered in his memo of rejection, he 
might consider horse and dog racing 'but I would exclude the service of 
anesthetizing people by TV.' " 
</P>
<P>
Merger or not, Time Inc.'s magazines seem to have lost track of the "higher 
calling" founder Henry Luce envisioned, he writes. "Magazines like People, the 
most profitable in the world . . . are journalistic voices whose independence 
is largely irrelevant. And even Time, the venerable flagship of the 
corporation, is now part of a national chorus of daily papers and newsweeklies 
in which its once brassy voice is harder to distinguish." 
</P>
<P>
Louis J. Slovinsky, vice president of corporate communications for Time Inc., 
dismissed the former Newsweek editor's comments. "You have to consider where 
the author is coming from," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reason Plans a New Era 
</P>
<P>
Robert Poole, editor and publisher of Reason magazine, thinks his publication, 
which has trumpeted a laissez-faire credo for 20 years, is entitled to at least 
a little credit for the climate of merger mania that deregulation has helped 
engender. 
</P>
<P>
But Reason, which moved from the backwater bliss of Santa Barbara to Santa 
Monica in 1986 to increase its visibility, is still working to build clout and 
thereby advance its libertarian ideals, Poole said. 
</P>
<P>
To an extent, achieving that goal will depend on who replaces current 
editor-in-chief Marty Zupan, who's moving on to a new job at the Institute for 
Humane Studies at George Mason University in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
The competition has been whittled down to five contenders, Poole said: the 
magazine's associate editor; the vice president of the libertarian-oriented 
Cato Institute in Washington; a fellow at the Hoover Institute; another at a 
Washington think tank, and a journalist with "a big-city Western newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
What he's looking for, Poole said, is someone with "a vision for the magazine 
for the next 10 years. We want to put Reason more into the mainstream of the 
discussion of ideas in this country. We'd like to have Reason be as much of a 
participant as the New Republic and National Review." 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, he asked candidates to complete "long written exercises," 
spelling out what the magazine's goals should be, and addressing tricky issues 
such as abortion, Central America and nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"The approach I'm looking for is more along the lines of the way New Republic 
deals with issues -- create a large tent and allow a number of acts to go on 
within that tent," he said. Editorial content would naturally "allow for 
individual liberty, free enterprise and limited government." But it wouldn't 
"necessarily adhere to a rigid party line." 
</P>
<P>
To gain the sort of influence it covets, Reason will have to double its 
circulation, from the current 30,000 figure -- which puts it at "the low end of 
the think-magazine scale, alongside magazines like the American Spectator," 
Poole said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a natural audience out there that is not really represented by any of 
the other think magazines. It's the people who are economically conservative, 
and socially liberal or tolerant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the 60,000 to 70,000 circulation that Poole envisions, the nonprofit 
Reason would still be a pipsqueak among the giant magazines of which 
megamergers are made. 
</P>
<P>
But Poole has no qualms about the trend toward the big getting 
</P>
<P>
bigger. Lawmakers such as Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, who has asked the Justice 
Department to look into the antitrust implications of the Time-Warner merger, 
are guilty of "typical political meddling," he said. "This small-minded 
populism is a terrible barrier to American firms and what they're up against on 
a global scale." 
</P>
<P>
Liberal fears about the concentration of media power in fewer and fewer 
corporate hands are unfounded, Poole believes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the hands are that few," he added. "When you have as open a 
market as we have, with people able to start community newspapers and the 
diversity of radio stations, I don't think there's any problem with viewpoints 
getting expressed. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Marriage East and West 
</P>
<P>
The constitution of the Soviet Union "guarantees that the state will bear 
responsibility for the well-being of the family," Woman's Day magazine reported 
last October, in an article accompanying a survey distributed simultaneously to 
women in the Soviet Union and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the 17-question survey were 200,000 Russians and 30,000 
Americans. But judging from the results, families are in trouble regardless of 
where they reside, or who is responsible for their well-being. 
</P>
<P>
Among the findings, to be published in a future issue of Woman's Day: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 65% of the women in both countries responded "no" to the question, "Would 
you like a daughter of yours to repeat your life experiences?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- 79% of Soviet women and 43% of American women said alcohol was a major 
cause of divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Given the opportunity to complete the phrase, "A good husband should be," with 
three of 16 choices, Soviet women voted for "faithful" and "a good head of the 
family" (56% each), while manliness came in third with 27% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, 73% of American women want a husband who is "communicative " 
and 72% want one who is "emotionally supportive." "Faithfulness" came in third 
at 63%. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-eight percent of American women don't feel that society adequately 
values the work they do at home, as compared to 45% of urban and 29% of rural 
Soviet women. 
</P>
<P>
As a press release on the survey points out: "28% of the Soviet women, who have 
had state-financed day care for decades, believe their salvation lies in more 
consumer goods while a comparable 24% of American women, who have had consumer 
goods for decades, believe their salvation lies in day care centers!"

ART BUCHWALD: SECRET IS OUT -- PET OWNERS ARE ABUSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of America's best-kept secrets is pet-owner abuse -- meaning the battering 
of owners by their pets. Nobody talks about it, but more and more people are 
showing up in hospital emergency rooms black and blue all over, and sometimes 
even with broken arms and fractured ribs. Inevitably, their injuries have been 
caused by "man's best friend," as these pets are called in the TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
There are no statistics available on how many battered pet owners there are in 
this country because these crimes are rarely reported. 
</P>
<P>
I recently made a hospital visit to a pet owner named Mary R. to hear her 
story. She was willing to speak for this column on the condition that we didn't 
show her face and that we disguised her voice. 
</P>
<P>
"How long have you been battered by your pet?" I asked her. 
</P>
<P>
She bit her lip, "For seven years. When he was a Doberman puppy, he was so 
lovable, but as he grew older he kept sneaking up from behind and knocking me 
down." 
</P>
<P>
"Why do you think he did it?" 
</P>
<P>
"He came from a long line of dogs who beat up their owners. It could very 
easily have been genetic." 
</P>
<P>
"How did you break your ribs?" I wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
Mary R. wiped away a tear. "I was walking Buster on a leash when he saw a 
squirrel and bolted for it. My mistake was to hold on. He dragged me for almost 
20 feet and my ribs cracked when I hit a rock garden dedicated to the Daughters 
of the American Revolution." 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like a typical battered pet-owner case." 
</P>
<P>
"What made it even worse was that after he stopped chasing the squirrel, he 
came back to where I lay bleeding and pretended to passers-by that nothing had 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
"Why did you let him back in the house?" 
</P>
<P>
She answered, "He's not like that all the time. Some days he can be as sweet as 
Haagen-Dazs ice cream, and I guess I put up with the battering just to have 
those moments." 
</P>
<P>
"Have you told anyone else that your Doberman beats up on you?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid to. Buster has a terrible temper and I don't know what he would do 
if he overheard me complaining about him on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
"Does he knock you down in front of your children?" 
</P>
<P>
"All the time. Once I was trying to adjust the TV set in the living room and he 
pushed me right through the screen." 
</P>
<P>
"How else does he abuse you?" I asked Mary R. 
</P>
<P>
This time she cried as she spoke, "He licks my face when I am trying to put on 
makeup." 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps if he won't go, you should leave him," I suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"Where could I hide?" 
</P>
<P>
I felt it was time to have a serious talk with Mary R. "Pet-owner abuse is 
practiced all over this country. It has existed for a long time, but people 
never talked about it. For centuries pets tripped up their owners and bit their 
ankles -- yet no one dared call the police. Then a few owners started to speak 
out and now there are support groups to help someone in need. You have a sick 
dog, and you have to stop making excuses for him. Otherwise, you will wind up 
in the broken bone department of this hospital every other week." 
</P>
<P>
Mary R. said, "I don't know whether it's worse to be pounded by a pet or to 
live alone." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't answer that," I confessed. "We know that Buster will never change and 
so you must. Does your pet mistreat your husband as well?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, he left home two months ago after telling me to choose between him and the 
dog." 
</P>
<P>
"And you chose the dog?" 
</P>
<P>
"I had to. He's my best friend."

ERMA BOMBECK: DELIVER US FROM THOSE GROWN-UP PAPERBOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erma Bombeck 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a story at the top of the page of our newspaper, and it should have 
been. The paper routes of the morning newspapers in many large American cities 
will no longer be delivered by kids, but by adults in cars. 
</P>
<P>
Get outta here! Tell me Barbie bleaches her ponytail. Tell me Dick Clark has a 
picture aging in his attic. But don't tell me that a tradition as old as the 
word is going down the tubes. 
</P>
<P>
I was a paperboy's mother for more years than I care to remember. It's on my 
resume. For years I listed it on my driver's license under "occupation." It 
tells you a lot about a person. (Your capacity for guilt and endurance for 
pain, to mention two.) I used to mention "our" route at parties and immediately 
be surrounded by admirers. 
</P>
<P>
The job, however, was more than just status for my son. Forget the fact that 
for a period of five or six years he was the only person we knew with a savings 
account and could have bought and sold his entire family. More important, those 
were the years he was introduced to that great American threat that parents use 
to scare their kids half to death: the dreaded "real world." 
</P>
<P>
It was his first encounter with responsibility, lousy hours and deadbeats. And 
he learned. He learned that birds that soar with "The Tonight Show" do not 
sprout wings at 4:30 the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
He learned that people who live in $225,000 houses do not have a cash flow of 
$1.50 for their newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
He learned you cannot plan your retirement around a broken bicycle chain, and a 
boy with a morning paper route has no friends when he wants a day off. 
</P>
<P>
He found out rather quickly that working on Sundays could give you a hernia. 
</P>
<P>
But the most important thing he discovered was that even though he represented 
nothing more than a "thud" to those still asleep in the morning, he was right 
up there in importance with the editors and writers of the paper he was 
carrying. 
</P>
<P>
He balanced on his bike the most perishable item being consumed by people: a 
newspaper. All the planning of the editors, the color, the sports scores, the 
Pulitzer Prize-winning exposes and the comic geniuses were all in the hands of 
an army of small kids pedaling their way through the darkness in the small 
hours of the morning. Without them, all of the people at the paper might just 
as well have been writing and illustrating history books. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons being cited for the demise of these carriers are fears over their 
safety, delivery costs, the weight of the Sunday editions and a shortage of 
willing youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's the "real world" now.

Aiko Yamashita of Monterey Park, who (along with numerous other readers, the 
most recent being Kathleen O'Neill of San Diego) has been looking for pants 
stretchers, will have to keep looking a while longer, unfortunately. The 
Vermont Country Store, which is the one source we knew of, advises that they no 
longer carry the pants stretchers. Can you help with a source without 
stretching things too far, or will Yamashita and dozens of other readers have 
to stop panting and settle for wrinkles -- even at an early age? 
</P>
<P>
William M. Gray of Los Angeles would like to find some soft cotton 
handkerchiefs either 15x15 or 18x18 inches. Can you (in)hail a source before 
Gray's nose is all out of joint, or will this always be a problem that's 
nothing to sneeze at? 
</P>

Dona Martyniak of Palos Verdes needs to have some old feather pillows cleaned. 
Can you join in this pillow talk without taking it lightly, or will Martyniak

Karen Lynch of Ventura, who wanted Size 12 shoes for her young daughter, no 
longer need to worry about having both feet on the ground. Phyllis Carter of 
Laguna Hills says some Payless shoe stores carry that size; if not, contact the 
mail-order department of Lane Bryant, P.O. Box 8301, Indianapolis, Ind. 
46283-8301. Barbara Berry of Torrance suggests either Nordstrom or Rushton's 
Tall Girl Shoes, 706 S. Hill St., downtown Los Angeles, (213) 622-8967. Also, 
she mentions these mail-order houses: Hill Bros., 99 9th St., Lynchburg, Va. 
24505-1466, and McB's Shoes for Women, 715 Market St., San Francisco, Calif. 
94103. And B. Newsum of Cambria says a company called Tall Girls Shoecraft 
advertises great shoes (sizes 10-13) in Vogue magazine. 
</P>

Carter Bingham of Pomona, who was after rubber rings for large-mouth fruit 
jars, writes that he found what he was looking for at Kitchen A' Ware, on the 
second level of the Montclair Plaza shopping center. In addition, Mrs. A. Britz 
of Encinitas mentioned Ball Container Group, Attention Beth West, Consumer 
Products Division, 5252 Bolsa Ave., Huntington Beach, Calif. 92649, and Ball 
Consumer Products, 1509 S. Macedonia Ave., Muncie, Ind. 47302.

Gladys of Los Angeles, who needed a Style 624 Goddess underwire bra, has 
received plenty of support. Naomi Bowman of the California Mart and B. Soroko 
of Santa Monica both say the item can be purchased at Pauline's Lingerie, 8815 
W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 275-1557; Bowman also mentions Paulette's, 
14538 Nordhoff St., Panorama City, and adds that Bullock's will order the item 
(they do not stock them). Helen M. Pulster of West Arcadia says she orders her 
624 bras from Yasuko's Bra &amp; Lingerie Salon, 999 E. Colorado Blvd., 
Pasadena, (818) 793-2476. And Louise Shane of the Valley Department Store, 245 
N. Euclid Ave., Ontario, (714) 984-8646, says they will be happy to 
special-order Style 624; they carry all the other Goddess styles.

YOUR COINS: IN THIS INSTANCE, A PART IS WORTH MORE THAN THE WHOLE 
</P>

Question: Why does the Red Book list proof sets (1958 and 1960) at one price, 
yet the Franklin half dollar by itself is listed at twice the proof's quoted 
price? Also, I've seen several ancient Greek, Roman and Byzantine collections 
floating around at apparently decent prices. Are they worth securing? Finally, 
I'd like to know the value of the following: 1896 gold $2 1/2 Coronet, light 
scratches or possible bag marks, sharp detail throughout; 1916 Buffalo nickel, 
MS-60; Iranian 1304 one-quarter krona, and 1913 Netherlands 5 cents. -- J.E.F. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You're absolutely right on the way the Red Book ("A Guide Book of 
United States Coins") prices the 1958 and 1960 United States proof sets and the 
individual half dollars of the same date. It doesn't make sense that one coin 
from a set would be worth more than the entire set. Quite often, however, proof 
sets and mint sets will be broken up because they contain a key coin, and that 
particular coin will enhance the value of denominational date sets. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the sum total of the whole should be worth more than any of its parts. 
The Red Book is an invaluable tool and belongs in every collector's library. 
But it is not without fault. Grading and pricing are the twin numismatic 
bugaboos. True pricing is done on a dealer-to-dealer and dealer-to-customer 
basis. The Red Book, which comes out once a year, is simply a reference point. 
Dealers and advanced collectors rely more on the Coin Dealer's Newsletter 
(commonly known as the Gray Sheet), which comes out weekly. Other price guides 
are available in the weekly numismatic press. But even here, there is 
considerable disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a buyer, try to get the best value for your money. Do this by 
studying the various price guides and comparing one coin to another. If you're 
a seller, price your coins fairly or there won't be any takers. 
</P>
<P>
As for buying ancient coins, that's entirely personal. It's a fascinating area 
of numismatics that has a loyal but specialized following. A coin with one 
emperor on it can lead to hours and hours of study and historical perspective. 
</P>
<P>
As for your 1896 $2 1/2 gold piece, it's probably worth about $175, considering 
the scratches you describe. Coins must be seen to be properly evaluated. Really 
nice specimens can be worth several thousand dollars. The same problem exists 
with the 1916 Buffalo nickel. It could be in the $5-to-$90 range, if accurately 
graded. Your Iranian krona is worth about $22; the 1913 Netherlands 5 cents is 
worth about $3.

TWYLA THARP LOOKS SHOW-BIZZY IN 'EVERLAST' AT ABT OPENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music/Dance Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twyla Tharp, that tough little bird of iconoclastic dance, has joined the 
Establishment. She has disbanded her own brazen band of modernists and taken on 
the title of artistic associate with American Ballet Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The kind push came to a very gentle shove on Tuesday, when the company opened 
its annual mini-season in the vast and unfriendly spaces of Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion turned out to be a classic demonstration of ABT eclecticism. A 
relatively small, patently enthusiastic audience registered approval for every 
hop, skip and jete. 
</P>
<P>
First came the arabesque orgy of the Shades episode from "La Bayadere," then a 
reasonable facsimile of Balanchine's ancient and still marvelous "Prodigal Son" 
(1929). For the climactic piece de resistance, the company offered the local 
premiere of Tharp's latest crossover opus, "Everlast," a.k.a. "A Gypsy 
Run-Through." 
</P>
<P>
The opus emerged sweet, amusing, cheekily nostalgic and not very magnum. The 
would-be climax remained a bit anticlimactic. For all its show-bizzy 
cleverness, the piece proved resistable. 
</P>
<P>
Tharp seems to have refused to turn another cheeky ballet. There's the rub. She 
has forsworn adventure in favor of mush. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the change represents a significant aesthetic swing or just a passing 
bagatelle remains to be seen. We'll see more, no doubt, when she guides Mikhail 
Baryshnikov's gallant gang through their first all-Tharp bill tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"Everlast" -- don't ask me, or the program, to explain either the title or its 
seemingly interchangeable subtitle -- is fun. Make no mistake. 
</P>
<P>
It tells a neat little triangular tale about a handsome boxing champ, his 
doting fan in boyish drag, and a rich widow's beautiful daughter. Flapping 
around the Palace Theater in 1919, it fuses vaudeville manners with balletic 
mannerisms and adds comic-mime punctuation. 
</P>
<P>
The point of departure for James Jones' scenario is confusing and inconsistent 
as well as flimsy. Apparently, some talented kids have gathered on the stage 
between performances. Deciding that they gotta dance, dance, dance, they 
improvise an elaborate show for themselves. Not since Judy Garland and Mickey 
Rooney. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The musical impetus for this quaint, politely zany period piece comes courtesy 
of Jerome Kern. In fact it comes courtesy of 16 -- count 'em, 16 -- terrific 
tunes. The number is generous for so vapid a venture. 
</P>
<P>
The songs, both popular and esoteric, span "Bullfrog Patrol," "Left All Alone 
Again Blues," "How'd You Like to Spoon with Me" and "I Told Every Little Star." 
A honky-tonk pianist and three badly amplified singers inhabit a corner near 
the proscenium. Jack Everly conducts Michael Dansicker's slick arrangements and 
William Brohn's deft orchestrations in the pit. 
</P>
<P>
Still, one looks center-stage for the silver lining. Tharp has concocted fleet 
footwork for Kevin O'Day, the charming, kinky-haired champ. She has rehashed 
beguiling wily-waif routines for Anne Adair as the fan who eventually gets him. 
Most interesting, she has devised very subtle, deceptively complex ballerina 
maneuvers for the gorgeous Susan Jaffe as the jilted socialite. 
</P>
<P>
The supporting cast includes Shelley Washington and Kathleen Moore as a pair of 
snazzy-jazzy busybodies, Georgina Parkinson as the sexy scheming matriarch and 
Richard Colton as the cigar-chomping trainer. Everyone works hard, oozes 
character. The soft shoe and the old hat coexist happily with the ballet 
slipper. 
</P>
<P>
Santo Loquasto's picturesque sets, flying flats and cute costumes are nifty. 
Jennifer Tipton's lighting is spiffy. 
</P>
<P>
Still, "Everlast" doesn't sustain lasting interest. One wants Tharp to be flip, 
not reverent. One yearns for a little expressive danger, some illuminating 
clashes of periods, ideas and styles. Perhaps there is more here than meets the 
jaded eye on first viewing. 
</P>
<P>
The revival of "Prodigal Son" seemed a bit soft at the articulative edges. The 
passage of time may be tainting Balanchine's stylized motions and angular 
gestures with too much realistic sentiment. Even so, one still can be 
overwhelmed by the choreographic invention, by the splashy Rouault designs and 
by Prokofiev's genial score. 
</P>
<P>
Danilo Radojevic manages to be lithe, eager, vulnerable and agonized in the 
title role, without casting much of a personal stamp upon it. This, of course, 
takes time. Cynthia Gregory remains an icy, mock-seductive, exceptionally 
long-limbed Siren. Michael Owen, like all Fathers in this context, is strong, 
wise and statuesque. 
</P>
<P>
In the "Bayadere" ceremonies, Cynthia Harvey returned from a sabbatical with 
the Royal Ballet and looked regal and willowy but oddly nervous. Andris Liepa, 
her potentially flamboyant partner from the Bolshoi, seemed tentative and 
self-absorbed. Perhaps they were distracted by a sticky, squeaky floor, not to 
mention an incessant hum from the lighting booth. 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, the primary honors here fell to the stellar subsidiary 
Shades (Amanda McKerrow, Deirdre Carberry and Christine Dunham), to the suave 
corps de ballet and the excellent orchestra conducted by Emil de Cou.

MICHELLE SHOCKED: THE GAP BETWEEN ART AND ATTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michelle Shocked, who headlined the Palace on Tuesday, is a Texas vagabond who 
has been hailed as everything from a Joan Baez with humor to a female Woody 
Guthrie. 
</P>
<P>
In an age obsessed with technology and flash in pop music, Shocked favors plain 
attire (a black cap, black sweater and jeans) and plays her songs on a $75 
guitar she bought 10 years ago in a pawn shop. Even the lanky performer's songs 
are simple -- at least on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Employing a folk singer's restlessness and innocence, she writes in her most 
affecting numbers about such everyday matters as old dirt roads, volunteer fire 
departments and kids' pranks. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's highly acclaimed album "Short Sharp Shocked" she turned those 
down-home images into wonderfully perceptive and original commentaries on 
people's aspirations -- and the factors that sometimes crush or defuse those 
dreams. Like much of Guthrie's work, the commentaries are occasionally laced 
with a sharp social bite. 
</P>
<P>
At the Palace, the freshness and warmth of the album's songs were especially 
endearing. How surprising then that Shocked's manner seemed far less generous 
and engaging. 
</P>
<P>
While working hard at disarming the audience with a folksy informality (lots of 
shy winks and aw-shucks smiles), she seemed discouragingly programmed. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the song introductions were word-for-word and wink-for-wink repeats of 
her set when she opened a few months ago for Billy Bragg at the Wiltern 
Theatre. Even worse, there were signs of the ultimate protest singer's disease: 
a patronizing attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Shocked explained to the supportive Palace audience that she now lives in 
London because she is disenchanted with the social apathy in her native land. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than offer the charitable spirit of someone who wants to encourage 
people to be more understanding, she acted as if anyone who disagreed is an 
inferior being in need of scolding. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a song about Vietnam," Shocked said sarcastically, in introducing an 
anti-war song by the late Steve Goodman. "That was a war about 15 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Shocked took on a discouragingly easy target: evangelical hucksters. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious and heavy-handed moments contrasted sharply with the grace of the 
album. They also raised questions about the future of Shocked's work -- work 
that to this point has been exceptionally promising. 
</P>
<P>
Because Shocked is female and sings in a folk-based style, she has been 
frequently linked in pop trend pieces with Tracy Chapman and Suzanne Vega. But 
Shocked is in no way a shadow of either artist. 
</P>
<P>
There is a rural, open-spaces feel to her music, as opposed to the urban 
tension of Chapman or the uptown sophistication of Vega. On record, where she 
uses a band, Shocked offers inviting folk, rockabilly and roadhouse blues 
touches. 
</P>
<P>
At the Palace, where she was accompanied by just the $75 guitar, the music was 
more plain, but the themes were no less engaging. 
</P>
<P>
In songs such as "Memories of East Texas," Shocked sets the scene with a 
greater sense of landscape than most pop writers. She speaks of the "pine-green 
rolling hills" and "all the curves down by Kelsey Creek and the detour by 
Lindsay's pasture." 
</P>
<P>
In establishing the comfortable, everyday images of hometown sentimentality, 
she is just setting up the listener for a twist at the end: a reflection on how 
small towns can be intolerant and break the spirit of young mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
The same sense of understated commentary -- and even fury -- is found in 
"Graffiti Limbo," a story of a New York graffiti artist who died of 
strangulation under reportedly cloudy circumstances after being arrested by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
But Shocked's artistry isn't limited to confrontation. "Hello Hopeville" is a 
sweet tale of two people on the run, one eager to leave home and the other 
looking for one after a long time on the road. Sample line, "He was waiting for 
a station / Just like some people wait for a train." 
</P>
<P>
With songs this graceful, there is no need to hammer people with sarcasm or 
turn them off with smugness. The humanity of Shocked's work carries its own 
power and persuasion. At the Palace, she needed to show more faith in that 
humanity.

The Italian film company that co-produced "The Last Emperor" is going to build 
a $17-million film studio in Singapore. Due for completion in about two years, 
the complex will be used for indoor shooting by Cecchi Gori Summit Studios

Actor Buddy Rogers was at the new Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in 
Griffith Park Wednesday to dedicate the Mary Pickford Education Center and 
Library. The center features three classrooms, a docent library and the 
administrative complex for the Western museum's education department. The 
center was funded by a $225,000 grant from the Mary Pickford Foundation, a 
donation made "because programs at the museum will emphasize the role of women 
and minorities, something about which Mary felt strongly," said Rogers, husband 
of the late film star. He said that only once before has the Mary Pickford 
Foundation awarded funding at that level. A similar amount was given for the 
Mary Pickford Theater at the Library of Congress. ALEENE MacMINN

Jean Stapleton, who as dingbat Edith Bunker was a notoriously lousy cook on 
TV's "All in the Family," is playing one of the TV kitchen's best-known cooks, 
Julia Child, in a musical monologue, "Bon Appetit!" Stapleton sings her way 
through Child's recipes in the one-woman show that played Wednesday at the 
Kennedy Center in Washington and is due to come West next month, including 
April 5 in Long Beach and April 9 in Santa Fe, N.M. Child, in an interview with 
the New York Times, said she's delighted and flattered by the show: "You can 
have an awful lot of fun with cooking. It doesn't have to be serious. . . . I'm 
a ham anyway." The monologue was adapted by composer Lee Hoiby from one of 
Child's 1961 TV programs. ALEENE MacMINN

Former Broadway producer Adela Holzer was arraigned in New York Wednesday on 
second-degree grand larceny charges that she duped investors out of at least 
$1.5 million in oil investments that she actually used to help finance an 
upcoming pop opera. The judge in Manhattan's state Supreme Court entered a plea 
of not guilty for Holzer, who appeared alone, allegedly because she failed to 
pay her lawyer. Holzer, 54, was ordered to return with a lawyer on Wednesday 
for a hearing. Holzer was arrested after a wary investor hired a private 
investigator to look into her background. She allegedly used some of the money 
to finance two pop operas conceived by Tom O'Horgan, "Senator Joe" and "Nimrod 
and the Tower of Babel." ALEENE MacMINN

SHANGHAI STRING QUARTET IN WEST COAST DEBUT AT BIOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the intensity of a musical performance could be measured like that of an 
earthquake, the West Coast debut of the Shanghai String Quartet, Monday at 
Biola University, would have registered a good 7.0 on the Richter scale. The 
ensemble, formed in 1983 at the Shanghai Conservatory and now serving as the 
resident graduate ensemble at Juilliard, proved one of the most taut and 
interpretively unified in memory. 
</P>
<P>
The quartet's assertive, muscular approach produced stunning results in 
Bartok's Third Quartet. Fully capitalizing on timbral and dynamic contrasts and 
effectively bringing out contrapuntal lines, the four gave an unusually 
propulsive, rhythmically vital account that kept the listener fully engaged 
from beginning to end. 
</P>
<P>
The same was true for the Debussy Quartet, a work not normally delivered with 
such urgency and extroversion. By virtue of the extraordinary expressiveness 
and sheer dynamism of their playing, the four made their view of the work 
absolutely convincing. Moreover, the Andantino was delivered with uncommon 
sensitivity, and made for a remarkable and very moving contrast. 
</P>
<P>
The high-powered interpretation of Mozart's Quartet in C ("Dissonant"), 
however, made no sense. Obvious tempo changes, uncharacteristic crescendos and 
unusually heavy accents robbed the work of its elegance and subtlety. Although 
the four players -- violinists Wei-Gang Li and Hong-Gang Li, violist Zheng Wang 
and cellist Kathe Jarka -- demonstrated the same high level of virtuosity here 
as elsewhere, they showed little understanding of the Classical style. 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm of the predominantly student audience elicited one encore -- a 
modern arrangement of a Chinese folk song. TERRY McQUILKIN

DONALD CROCKETT LEADS MUSIC ENSEMBLE AT USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fruits of hard work were on display when Donald Crockett conducted USC's 
Contemporary Music Ensemble Tuesday night at Hancock Auditorium, USC. An 
appreciative audience was rewarded with an intelligent, varied program of four 
works, all given superb attention by the student chamber orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the evening, Aaron Kernis' "America(n) (Day) Dreams" (1984), 
was a Post-Modern setting of six stream-of-consciousness poems by May Swenson. 
Written for amplified voice and chamber ensemble, Kernis' dreamlike work 
unfolded mysteriously through a variety of styles which included a subtle quote 
of the Herman's Hermits song "There's a Kind of Hush" and an epilogue in the 
style of a 1930s American dance band. 
</P>
<P>
Crockett led his forces with the right amount of wit, carefully placing every 
note and shaping each phrase. Mezzo Karen Born provided adequate singing, 
narration and Sprechgesang, beginning timidly, but eventually gaining more 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
In Gilbert Amy's serial "Echos XIII" (1976) for horn, trombone, harp, piano and 
chamber ensemble, Crockett and the four soloists painstakingly brought out tiny 
melodic fragments in a Baroque concerto form -- frenetic solo sections 
alternating with equally busy tutti interludes. Trombonist Mark Ammons supplied 
the most gusto, accurately mastering difficult, multifarious effects and quick 
passages. 
</P>
<P>
Completing the program were two British works: Benjamin Britten's Second Suite 
for Cello (1967), with cellist Philip Hansen demonstrating his admirable 
virtuosity, and Oliver Knussen's "Ophelia Dances 1" (1975) for chamber 
ensemble, a somewhat reserved but carefully wrought study on the madness of 
Ophelia in Shakespeare's "Hamlet." GREGG WAGER

STEVE LACY SEXTET GOES THROUGH THE MOTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Lacy, the celebrated "first soprano saxophonist of modern jazz" whose 
quest for an appreciative audience gave rise to his emigration to Europe in 
1970, opened a three-night stint at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Though the sextet features some extraordinary talents in pianist Bobby Few and 
bassist Jean-Jacques Avenel, there were few inspired moments during the 
three-tune, hourlong opening set. 
</P>
<P>
But there were plenty of moments of drudgery. Each of the tunes was composed by 
Lacy and each fit a specific formula that had the rhythm section performing as 
a conventional jazz trio backing three instrumentalists in an unyielding search 
for wrong notes. As an ensemble, the group sounded like a traffic jam with a 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the beat rarely swung. "Prospectus," the opening tune, started 
off swinging at a good clip, but Irene Aebi's violin began undermining the 
tempo as soon as she began her awkward underscoring of Steve Potts' 
alto-saxophone. 
</P>
<P>
Never designed to swing was "The Bath," a dirge-like tune composed of 
three-note descending riffs. Some pleasant melodic ideas by Potts were 
diminished when his penchant for playing out of the alto's natural range 
resulted in an imitation of a screech owl. 
</P>
<P>
Last on the agenda was "Gay Paree Bop," a joyless paean to be-bop that recalled 
the tremendous influence on the form of Arabic folk melodies and Chinese 
harmony. As if a lack of identity wasn't enough, the tune featured a vocal by 
Aebi that was delivered with all the warmth of a drill sergeant at dawn. Relief 
was the feeling when the song, delivered at breakneck speed, finally ended. 
</P>
<P>
Lacy, whose effectiveness in this setting was greatly lessened, remains one of 
the foremost proponents of the avant-garde. One senses, though, that pretense 
has replaced innovation, posturing replacing invention. And from the determined 
look and scowl on the soprano saxophonist's face, Lacy should, for his own 
sake, pursue music that offers some joy. A. JAMES LISKA

NEDRA WHEELER &amp; CO. MAKE A SOUND STATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before an overflow throng at CalArts' Roy O. Disney Hall in Valencia on Tuesday 
night, bassist Nedra Wheeler conducted a wide-ranging recital that proved there 
are many facets to her musical personality. Wheeler and her troupe investigated 
free-form world music improvisations, hard-edged modern swing and the blues. 
</P>
<P>
Playing acoustic bass throughout, the youthful Wheeler opened with a moody, 
slow improvisation that featured Joshua Spiegelman and Carl Clements on a 
variety of wooden and bamboo flutes and Charles Moore and Adam Rudolph offering 
percussive support. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Wheeler shifted to a sinuous, bluesy figure that elicited provocative, 
earthy statements from Moore, playing Tibetan conch (a horn said to be made of 
human thigh bone), and Clements. Rudolph delivered a fluid, hand-fluttering 
conga improvisation and the leader soloed briefly but effectively, achieving a 
sonorous sound. 
</P>
<P>
Modern jazz was spotlighted when Wheeler assembled a band highlighted by 
pianist Billy Childs, drummer Ndugu Chancler, saxman Jesse Sharps and Moore, 
this time playing trumpet. The undulating rhythm and repeating bass line of 
"Desert Song" evoked the image of a band of nomads moving slowly over the sand. 
Here Childs, one of modern music's imaginative improvisers, produced a mix of 
melodicism and energized playing. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler is a solid developing talent who should make a sound addition to the 
musical community. ZAN STEWART

PORT KEEPS WINE LOVERS AT BAY; 
</P>
<P>
GREAT VINTAGES TAKE TIME, BUT OTHER VARIETIES RIPE NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Port works wonders to chase away a chill, but wine lovers know that you can't 
pick just any Port in a storm. 
</P>
<P>
Vintage Port is the rarest of all Ports, made in only the best years, aged in 
wood for two years (occasionally as long as 2 1/2 years) and then aged in the 
bottle for eons. Great vintages of Port, such as 1963 or 1977, produce wines of 
such immense fruit and quality that it takes literally decades before they 
smooth out and become truly harmonious. 
</P>
<P>
I have stashed in my cellar a number of bottles of '63 Portuguese Ports that I 
have monitored over the years. Few of them are truly drinkable today; most need 
more cellar age. And they were produced a quarter century ago. Not long ago I 
tasted the legendary 1931 Quinta do Noval, one of the greatest vintage Ports 
ever produced. It wasn't at its peak yet! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fine Wine Takes Time 
</P>
<P>
This may explain the story of a wine-making couple I know who are both Port 
lovers. Both are in the early 50s. 
</P>
<P>
"We hadn't bought any of the '77s," he said, "so we went down to our local shop 
and asked the merchant which ones we should buy." 
</P>
<P>
"And he asked us how old we were," she said. "I am not a kid, I told him. 
</P>
<P>
"And he said, 'Look, folks, unless you're buying the '77s for your 
grandchildren, forget them and buy some tawnies.' " 
</P>
<P>
That's a message that many Port lovers give to newcomers to the game. Vintage 
Ports can be great, but they take great patience. And for that reason, tawny 
Ports can be a better buy. First, they're much cheaper, not to mention the fact 
that you don't have to lay them in your cellar until heck freezes over. Tawny 
Ports provide a grand accompaniment for savories because they are lighter than 
most vintage Ports and have a patina of age the day you buy the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Great Deal of Patience 
</P>
<P>
Aged in wood at least six years, tawny Ports are often blended with some mature 
Port and some younger stock, giving the wine a fruity quality and an older, 
more wizened character. 
</P>
<P>
One of my favorites over the years has been a Port called Fonseca Bin 27 (about 
$15) that has quite a bit of fruit, and usually offers a slightly chocolatey 
taste. Another reasonably priced tawny Port is Smith Woodhouse Rare Tawny 
($13). 
</P>
<P>
At the upper levels of this category, Graham's 10-year-old and 30-year-old 
tawnies ($19 and $52, respectively) are remarkable and very complex older Ports 
without any of the harshness associated with vintage Port. The latter is a Port 
that was aged in barrel for 30 years, about as long as any tawny you'll find. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the great length of time it takes to get a vintage Port mature, the 
various producers in Portugal have developed a whole range of styles aimed at 
making Ports you can drink sooner. (As the Port shippers say, these other wines 
are intended to give you something you can drink while you are waiting for your 
vintage Ports to mature.) 
</P>
<P>
One such type of Port with the style of a vintage but without the need to age 
the wine very long is called Vintage Character Port, and a few of those exist 
in the market, such as Dow's, which sells for about $30 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Another attempt to make a vintage wine without quite the aging requirements of 
a true vintage Port is the single-quinta (vineyard) wine of an "off" year. In 
some vintages (such as 1976 and 1978) when quality isn't as high as in a true 
vintage year, some producers make a single-year wine more or less like a 
vintage Port from single vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
Graham often releases off-year single-vineyard wines from its Malvedos 
vineyard, and the 1976 and 1978 Malvedos wines from Graham (about $30 each) are 
currently available. Both are charming wines, heavier than a tawny, but not 
quite as deep and complex as a classic vintage. Single-quinta wines usually are 
at their peak in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Late-Bottled Vintage 
</P>
<P>
Another class of Port intended to emulate the quality level of vintage Port but 
without demanding that the consumer stash the stuff for half a lifetime is 
designated LBV. This stands for late-bottled vintage and designates a Port that 
was made from a single vintage, but aged longer than a vintage Port in barrel 
-- usually three to six years. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, this is a lesser-wood-aged tawny, but with some of the vintage 
qualities. (It is sometimes seen with the most confusing phrase "Port of the 
Vintage 19XX." This is not true Vintage Port, but the phrase sort of indicates 
that it is.) 
</P>
<P>
Ruby Port is an attempt to retain the fresh fruit quality of the wine without 
adding a lot of flavor from wood aging, and ruby Ports can be fun with savories 
too. However, I prefer them only as a contrast, or served with a light dessert. 
</P>
<P>
Quady and J.W. Morris make some of California's most consistent vintage and 
non-vintage Ports. Quady's vintage wines appear to require the same amount of 
aging as good Portuguese Ports. (A 1977 Quady, tasted some months ago, was 
still remarkably young and vivacious.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleasing California Ports 
</P>
<P>
Other California producers make Ports that can be very pleasing and work with 
savories too. Three vintage Ports now on store shelves are 1980 Christian 
Brothers, 1982 Burgess and 1985 Beringer, all well-made and complex, needing a 
bit more time in bottle. Harder to find and closer to the Portuguese model is a 
Port called St. Amant, made from traditional Portuguese varieties. 
</P>
<P>
Many other California wineries make tawny Ports that sell for a lot less and 
usually are good consistent values, though a lot of what says "Port" on the 
label is little more than sweet wine, lacking much character. We tried the 
Gallo Livingston Tawny ($4) and found it somewhat syrupy and heavy, but clean 
and drinkable. 
</P>
<P>
Another alternative is Australian Port. Some of the latest imports in Port from 
Australia are exciting wines and good values. 
</P>
<P>
To test a broad range of Ports from California and Portugal, we selected 10 
currently available Ports at random from various wine shops and sampled them to 
determine their general qualities. They are listed here in the order in which 
they were tasted, and ranked for quality on a five-point scale. Prices are 
those we actually paid. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Masson Rare Souzao Cuvee 301S ($7.69): The wine in the familiar 
heart-shaped bottle is not the same wine it once was. In years past, it was 
truly tawny in color and paler in overall mouth feel. This tasting showed the 
wine to be fairly heavy and dense, with a slight pruny, syrupy finish. Nicely 
made, but not very elegant. 
</P>
<P>
Ficklin (bottled in 1987) ($9.35): Tawny/pale in color with some fruit, but a 
bit thin, lacking in depth. Well made, but short in the aftertaste. 
</P>
<P>
Warre's Warrior ($6.50/half bottle): This reliable Port always offers good 
richness. It is pale with red highlights; good fruit, but fairly subtle. A 
slight pepperiness in the taste makes for a fairly complex wine. 
</P>
<P>
Llords and Elwood Ancient Proverb ($5.47): Slightly Sherried and pruny, this 
longtime favorite in California has good flavor and richness for the money. Not 
classic Port, but nice dessert wine. 
</P>
<P>
Sandeman Fine Ruby Port ($5.49): The only true Ruby Port in our tasting, it 
showed classic ruby aroma of cherries and currants, with a hint of apples 
tossed in for interest. This Port is light and fresh and clearly not a good 
match for sharper savories. Better served with apples and pears, or a pear 
tart. 
</P>
<P>
Quady Port of the Vintage 1981 ($7.99): An overripe, Zinfandel-ish sort of 
aroma is big, bold and tannic. Made like a vintage wine, but lacking the 
overall fruit. Good wine in a bigger, full-bodied style. 
</P>
<P>
Graham Late Bottled 1981 ($7.95/half bottle): One of the stars of the tasting, 
this most complex wine had marvelous fruit and richness and wasn't as harsh in 
the mouth as some. A superior wine. 
</P>
<P>
Dow's 1972 Reserve ($16.95): This is a single-year tawny that was aged seven 
years in cask. It had a true tawny color, fairly pale, but was very complex and 
smooth. Lacking in youthful fruit (it is, after all, 16 years old), the wine 
was silky and refined. 
</P>
<P>
Fonseca Late Bottled 1983 ($16.49): Another tawny type from a single vintage, 
this very dark, deep-colored wine has a huge, rich, potent aroma of fruit and a 
slight leathery quality. In the mouth, it's potent and peppery, a grand match 
for very sharp cheeses. It's more like a young vintage Port than a tawny. 
</P>
<P>
Warre's Nimrod 20-Year-Old ($15.99): A classic well-aged tawny that is pale 
bronze in color (little if any red color is left), but with a complex Sherry, 
spice and nutmeg character. Very appealing wine because of its utter smoothness 
and finesse. 
</P>
<P>
Those who are interested in true vintage Port with some bottle age and are 
willing to pay the price to get it may still be able to order some of the 
better wines from the great 1970 and 1975 vintages at about $75 to $100 a 
bottle. Ask your merchant to tell you what's available (some wholesalers still 
stock older Ports and can order them for you).

Sometimes the best wine is made by people with hearing acute enough to hear the 
voices of the grapes. 
</P>
<P>
Almost any wine maker can recite the lesson of silk purses and sow's ears, yet 
some, even those carefully trained at the best institutions, still can't hear 
what the grapes are saying. Instead of paying attention and learning from the 
vine, these folks proceed down a merry path to perdition, wondering what went 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
At Chappellet, the people are good listeners, and by listening they have 
created two decades of consistency. 
</P>
<P>
Donn and Mollie Chappellet left the food-vending business in Los Angeles 22 
years ago to move to a ledge just below the crest of Pritchard Hill, on the 
eastern slope overlooking Rutherford in the Napa Valley. The vineyard they 
acquired was Donn's pleasure; Mollie saw potential in the soil about 1,500 feet 
up for her vegetable and herb garden. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, wine makers have developed skill with their vineyards that now 
ramble over 110 hill-and-dale acres. My first contact with these wines was in 
the late 1970s when Joe Cafaro was wine maker. He listened to the grapes and 
made great wine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passing the Baton 
</P>
<P>
When Cafaro left for places like Keenan and now Sinskey, his replacement, Cathy 
Corison, picked out of the archives a few of the elements left from the Cafaro 
regime (and from Philip Togni before Cafaro) and honed them into a style that 
can only be called demanding. 
</P>
<P>
Stating it succinctly, Chappellet wines have never been very yielding in youth. 
If anything, they are reticent to the point of taunting: Guess what I am. Guess 
what I'm going to be. Nyah-nyah, fooled ya. 
</P>
<P>
Mollie's garden, gracing more than an acre in an arc around the side of their 
huge house on the ledge, has in it many messages. We looked at the cauliflowers 
facing the western sun of a Monday noon. It is late February. Atypically the 
sun is warm and bright. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Like Cold Weather 
</P>
<P>
"They like a little cold weather, but they shield their eyes from the sun when 
it gets this warm," said Mollie, pointing to the leaves that seem to be closing 
around the cauliflower heart inside for protection. The message was clear: 
plants do more than just sit there. So pay attention. Learn from them. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no recipes in wine making," said Cathy Corison a few minutes later. 
"You have to know your grapes and you have to adapt every year." Especially 
when your lowest vineyard is 1,200 feet above the valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
Donn, a tall, burly, bearded man with a sweet smile who rarely comes down off 
the mountain, loves the wines he grows here, even though he knows his only 
recognition will come from those who taste the wines years after they are 
released. 
</P>
<P>
"Our wines have seldom ranked very high early in their life," he says, taking 
another sip of his 1985 Chenin Blanc. "Our Chenin Blancs, for instance. People 
might think we were drinking an 'old' wine with this '85, but the way we make 
them, this one is just reaching its peak." 
</P>
<P>
Corison treats Chenin Blanc here as one would Chardonnay. It's fermented dry, 
aged in oak barrels, and by the time it is released, its delicate, harmonious 
flavors emulate the grape of Burgundy so closely that it's the perfect thing 
with which to defrock the local wine snob. 
</P>
<P>
The '85, still available at $7.50 a bottle, has a slight melon and pine forest 
aroma, and a crispness that matches with so many foods it's the near-perfect 
all-purpose wine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Balanced Wine 
</P>
<P>
Chappellet Chardonnay is the one wine that I recall fondly from the Cafaro days 
as having the balanced, lean, austere, Burgundian characteristics that set it 
apart from so many of the tutti-frutti California-style wines. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 Chappellet Chardonnay is spicy with an almost peppery element, but its 
angular acidity helps make it a perfect match for food. Made to age in bottle, 
this wine should improve for some years. 
</P>
<P>
By way of comparison, Cafaro's new 1986 Sinskey Chardonnay shows a similar 
style from a different region. The Sinskey wine, made from grapes grown in the 
cool Carneros region, is given no skin contact for added, extractive flavor, 
and the wine does not go through contortions to wrench extraneous flavors. 
</P>
<P>
It is simply fermented in barrels and left there to allow its flavors to marry 
with the spent yeast cells. Corison uses much the same regime at Chappellet. 
</P>
<P>
Both of these wineries offer Chardonnays that early in life offer high acidity 
and austere aftertastes, which are unlikely to excite those who prefer the 
bubble-gummy flavors in Chardonnay that has been injected almost by syringe. 
</P>
<P>
Yet now, with a teensy bit of bottle age, the Sinskey Cafaro '86 is already 
showing its mettle, and Corison's stylishly complex 1986 Chappellet also hints 
at what it will become. 
</P>
<P>
I treasure in my cellar a couple of bottles left from a case of Chappellet's 
'74 Chardonnay I acquired in 1976. Tasting it again the other evening at a 
dinner Cafaro and Sinskey tossed to show his ability to handle grapes, I can 
now see the faint link between Cafaro and his handling of the grapes (and of 
his education at the hands of Togni before him), and what Corison has moved on 
to. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considering the Reds 
</P>
<P>
Another good example of the Corison deftness is in the Cabernets. My favorite 
Chappellet Cabernet from the Cafaro era was the '75, a wine of ample structure 
and broadly appealing fruit and complexity these days, and for the last few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, but it was hard and austere and pretty hard to like when it was released," 
said Donn. "We weren't sure what it would become." I have tasted it twice in 
the last three months. It is magnificent, perhaps the best of all the '75 
California Cabernets produced. 
</P>
<P>
Because of high tannin levels and few pats on the back when the wines were 
young in the past, Donn and Corison moved on from the 1970s-style wines to a 
more accessible style, from 1983 onward. Today the wines show better harmony 
early, yet remain wines clearly to be aged. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980 Cabernet is a throwback to the earlier style. Still commercially 
available, it retails for $30. I don't like it. Product of a too-hot vintage 
year, it is a huge, brooding sort of thing that has a dual personality. On the 
one hand, it fancies itself as a dinner wine, with pretentions at matching with 
game. On the other, it is Port praying for Gorgonzola. Not bad, but not my cup 
of tea. 
</P>
<P>
The 1983, on the other hand, is a lovely expression of the wine maker's art. 
From an awkward vintage, Corison crafted this wine to be more engaging and 
lively, a perfect wine for restaurants since it is so approachable now, but 
will improve rapidly in the next five years, At $16, it's a good value. 
</P>
<P>
The two best wines in the line are the latest Cabernets, 1984 and 1985. The 
former ($18) is a sleeper, with an intriguing blackberry aroma and toasty 
elements that indicate a very long life. The '85 ($20) is more refined in some 
ways, showing a degree of grace and lively fruit that certainly should carry 
the wine. Both will do well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Donn summed up Chappellet: 
</P>
<P>
"There is a certain limited range to what we can do with these grapes," he 
said. "There is a limited number of styles of wine we could make. And we can 
certainly ruin it, but we can only improve on it by about 20%. The other 80% is 
the grapes." 
</P>
<P>
But you have to listen. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1986 Gundlach-Bundschu Merlot ($12) -- There is a load of 
cherry, cassis, raspberry and chocolatey fruit in this fairly rich and quite 
ripe wine. It is still tannic, but a year or two should round out the 
adolescent edges. A grand wine for the near term while you're waiting for your 
Cabernets to develop.

BREAD MAKES DIFFERENCE IN SANDWICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN GILLINGHAM, Gillingham is a Los Angeles-based food writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Except in a few instances, such as a Monte Cristo, Reuben or club, sandwiches 
are usually named for their fillings. That's the way it should be, of course. I 
guess we could order a rye sandwich on chopped liver instead of chopped liver 
on rye, but it got started the other way around and now we're stuck with it. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the bread makes a big difference in how a sandwich tastes. In fact, 
without the bread there wouldn't even be a sandwich, would there? So when it 
comes to choosing the proper slices to sandwich turkey or peanut butter 
between, it's important to pick the proper bread. In my opinion whole-wheat is 
the good for peanut butter and honey, rye for corned beef, white for a club 
sandwich and sourdough for turkey and avocado. The bread may be as ordinary as 
the filling is exotic, but one must round out the other. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doubles as a Sauce 
</P>
<P>
For another sandwich, pita bread replaces flour tortillas to wrap around turkey 
salad with a southwestern flavor. The pita is flat like a tortilla, but doesn't 
require heating to prevent cracking and certainly is much easier to eat without 
a fork than corn bread, the only other flavor of bread that fits this filling 
in my opinion. And, after all, the reason behind eating something between two 
slices of bread is so you can pick it up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TEX-MEX TURKEY PITAS 
</P>
<P>
3 cups shredded cooked turkey or chicken 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chopped sweet red pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup chopped cilantro 
</P>
<P>
1 (2 1/4-ounce) can sliced black olives, drained 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup vegetable oil 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons chili powder 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon coarse salt 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
6 pita breads 
</P>
<P>
Shredded lettuce 
</P>
<P>
Red onion slices 
</P>
<P>
Avocado slices 
</P>
<P>
In bowl, combine turkey, red pepper, cilantro and olives. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
In separate bowl, beat vinegar with oil, chili powder, salt, cumin and pepper. 
Pour dressing over turkey mixture and toss to combine. Chill until ready to 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
Tear pita breads in half and fill each with some turkey mixture. Add lettuce, 
onion and avocado. Makes 6 servings.

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: OAT BRAN PRODUCTS PROVE POPULAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman at a local bakery recently sauntered up to the counter to ask the clerk 
if the outlet's brand of oat bran muffins could reduce her cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid I really don't know," the clerk responded. "Our bakery items are 
already prepared when we get them. We just bake the dough." 
</P>
<P>
The customer seemed a bit confused, since the young woman behind the 
magnificent display of baked goods had failed to answer her question. 
Nonetheless, the customer headed for the bin of oat bran muffins. 
</P>
<P>
To her dismay, the bin was empty -- another example of consumer demand for a 
product with a perceived health effect. And bakeries aren't the only retailers 
finding it hard to keep oat bran muffins on the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
After being bombarded by weekend shoppers, a Los Angeles membership warehouse 
chain, where consumers can buy foods and other items at reduced prices, had 
trouble offering Monday morning shoppers any of their usually large supply of 
oat bran muffins, even though the rest of the warehouse items had been 
completely restocked after the busy two-day spree. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that Angelenos are very eager to buy food items that contain oat 
bran. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers have been quick to respond to that consumer demand. They tout oat 
bran as an ingredient in everything from gourmet cold breakfast cereals to 
granola-type snack bars. Gourmet cookie makers are even adding bran cookies to 
their product lines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increased Consumer Interest 
</P>
<P>
Health experts claim -- and opinion polls indicate -- a growing interest by 
consumers in reducing their blood cholesterol to acceptable levels. But often 
the amount of oat bran in commercial products -- when compared to that given to 
participants in the study that recognized the cholesterol-lowering effects of 
the fiber -- produces insignificant health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to keep in mind that the study group consumed two ounces of oat 
bran each day, which represents about two-thirds of a cup of the insoluble 
fiber. And they followed a low-fat diet that derived only 30% of its calories 
from fat. 
</P>
<P>
This can easily be translated into a one-ounce serving of hot oat bran cereal, 
oatmeal or cold oat cereal in the morning, oat bran or oatmeal bread with 
sandwiches for lunch, oat bran muffins as an afternoon snack and an oatmeal 
cookie for dessert. Spoon a tablespoon or two of oat bran into savory dishes or 
into crust mixtures for oven-baked chicken. Substituting oats for up to 
one-third of the flour called for in some recipes is another option. 
</P>
<P>
Maintaining a low-fat diet regimen is also vital. Use nonfat milk, lean meat 
and egg whites instead of whole eggs in recipes. Remove the skin from chicken 
before cooking and coat the chicken with an oat bran crumb mixture and bake 
instead of frying. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

In a study with far-reaching implications for the routine treatment of heart 
attack patients, researchers have found that the immediate use of special 
balloons to force open clogged arteries is unnecessary in the vast majority of 
cases if the patient is treated with a clot-dissolving drug. Most heart 
specialists have assumed that the balloon treatment, an expensive and 
increasingly popular procedure called balloon angioplasty, should routinely 
follow the use of drugs, such as TPA, that dissolve the blood clots that cause 
most heart attacks. But in a study of 3,262 heart-attack patients, researchers 
at medical centers across the country found the extra measures were rarely 
needed. The results were reported in today's issue of the New England Journal 
of Medicine.

Sudan's Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi has sent an envoy to try to persuade rebels 
in the south to accept a truce so that food may be distributed to 100,000 
people reported starving to death in the famine-ravaged region. Mahdi told 
reporters that he sent his interior minister to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to meet 
with the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army. He also said he has accepted a 
peace agreement that was previously rejected by his Umma Party and Islamic 
militants in Parliament. Meanwhile, a U.N.-sponsored conference opened in 
Khartoum, and relief officials said they hoped to get 100,000 tons of food and 
medicines into southern Sudan before the spring rainy season.

Polish students marched or rallied in at least six cities on the anniversary of 
free speech riots in 1968. The demonstrations were remarkable for their 
peacefulness and for the restraint shown by police. Brief disturbances broke 
out at the end of marches in Wroclaw and Warsaw, but only members of radical 
fringe groups were involved, and they were shrugged off as provocateurs by 
fellow demonstrators. Contributing to the mood was the announcement Tuesday 
that Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and other opposition negotiators have won 
government agreement to legalize the Independent Students Assn. after a 
seven-year ban. In Warsaw, police helped direct traffic around two separate 
marches held with official permission.

A House committee gave party-line approval to legislation that would require 
large employers to provide up to 10 weeks of unpaid leave for parents to take 
care of newborn or seriously ill children. The bill, a major part of 
congressional Democrats' domestic agenda, also would require companies with 50 
or more employees to grant similar leave to workers who need extended time off 
to take care of ailing parents. The measure cleared the House Education and 
Labor Committee on a 23-12 vote at the end of a daylong meeting in which the 
panel beat back about two dozen Republican-sponsored amendments.

The Christic Institute, whose lawsuit against several Iran-Contra figures was 
dismissed, posted a $1.2-million surety bond guaranteeing payment of 
defendants' legal costs if the group loses its appeal. U.S. District Judge 
James Lawrence King in Miami dismissed the Washington-based public interest law 
firm's $23.8-million lawsuit last June 23, four days before the trial was 
scheduled to begin. He ordered the group Feb. 2 to pay $1 million in legal fees 
and costs to 14 defendants. The $1.2-million surety bond covers the defendants' 
previous legal costs and appeals costs and fees if the group loses its appeal 
of King's ruling.

CONGRESS, DARMAN PLAN BUDGET TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic congressional leaders announced a two-week period of negotiations 
with Budget Director Richard G. Darman to see if a compromise spending and 
deficit-reduction package can be worked out between the White House and Capitol 
Hill. Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) of the Senate Budget Committee and his 
House counterpart, Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), will take part in the 
talks with ranking Republican members of their committees, New Mexico Sen. Pete 
V. Domenici and Minnesota Rep. Bill Frenzel. Sasser and Panetta said in a joint 
letter that their previous private meetings with Darman had been "frank and 
constructive" and should move on. "We propose that the budget task force 
discussions enter a new phase: an exploration of areas of possible compromise 
between Congress and the Administration on a fiscal year 1990 budget," they 
wrote.

Ten senior enlisted men with top-secret clearances have been convicted in the 
theft of up to $50,000 worth of computers and tools at Norton Air Force Base 
and elsewhere, Air Force sources said. At least one civilian and an officer 
reportedly are still under investigation in the case that began with the 
scrutiny of 34 people. An Air Force spokeswoman said most of the merchandise, 
purchased from private outlets with government funds and appropriated for 
personal use, has been returned. Officials said there had been no breach of 
security. Most of those involved were stationed at Norton, near San Bernardino, 
and assigned to two top-secret units under the Air Logistics Command. 
Punishments have included reprimands, demotions, pay forfeiture, confinement, 
hard labor and bad-conduct discharges.

A 27-year-old Marine collapsed and died during a three-mile run that was part 
of a semiannual physical fitness test, a spokesman at the Barstow Marine 
Logistics Center said. According to base officials, Darryl Eugene White of 
Montgomery, Ala., was near the halfway point of the run when he collapsed. The 
fitness test consists of pull-ups, sit-ups and the three-mile run, officials 
said. The San Bernardino County coroner's office planned an autopsy.

CITY WANTS INQUIRY INTO SDG&amp;E MERGER SWITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of San Diego on Wednesday demanded that federal regulators subpoena 
two former San Diego Gas &amp; Electric board members to help determine if 
Southern California Edison used "improper financial inducements" to coerce 
SDG&amp;E's board members into approving the proposed merger between the two 
utilities. 
</P>
<P>
The city Wednesday asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to subpoena 
former SDG&amp;E board members Charles (Red) Scott and O. Morris Sievert -- 
both of whom resigned after the SDG&amp;E board vote. 
</P>
<P>
The city hopes to uncover evidence that SDG&amp;E board members who first 
opposed Edison's merger proposal changed their votes because of financial 
inducements and unidentified "threats." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Abrupt' Reversal 
</P>
<P>
 The filing Wednesday was prompted by the "abrupt and unexplained" reversal by 
SDG&amp;E board members, who last summer rebuffed Edison's first merger offer. 
SDG&amp;E's board on Nov. 30 accepted a sweetened stock-swap merger offer from 
Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Edison spokesman Lewis Phelps denied any improprieties in the board vote. "The 
(negotiations) leading to the merger vote were conducted at an appropriate 
arm's-length distance," Phelps said. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E had not seen the filing on Wednesday, according to SDG&amp;E 
spokesman Maurice Luque. Attorneys representing Scott and Sievert were not 
available for comment on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The city also will petition the state Public Utilities Commission for authority 
to subpoena Scott and Sievert, San Diego City Atty. John Witt said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're interested in knowing what the directors were told prior to their 
voting," said Witt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision 'Puzzling' 
</P>
<P>
David Bardine, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer who represents the city in FERC 
proceedings, was not available for comment on Wednesday. However, Witt said 
that Bardine's firm "has a pretty good idea" of what Edison told SDG&amp;E's 
board members before the Nov. 30 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The city "finds puzzling the decision of most of SDG&amp;E's directors to 
recommend (the) merger -- after having previously opposed the merger proposal," 
according to the Wednesday filing. 
</P>
<P>
The filing also suggested that Edison might have "exercised improper economic 
leverage against SDG&amp;E by denying access to transmission capacity" to parts 
of the country with excess electricity.

CORETTA SCOTT KING SIDESTEPS CONTROVERSY ON CONVENTION CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN MAREE SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coretta Scott King, the widow of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., gave a lecture on 
the civil rights movement to hundreds of students at the University of San 
Diego Wednesday, but she sidestepped the controversy over the naming of the San 
Diego Convention Center after the slain civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
King, whose lecture was "Perspectives of Civil Rights," said she doesn't know 
much about the issue and she tries to stay out of decisions made by local 
communities with regard to honoring King. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not . . . informed about the specific issue. . . . Every city has its own 
way" of honoring King, she told a reporter. "A lot depends upon . . . people 
within the community." 
</P>
<P>
King added that she doesn't like "getting involved with those kind of local 
situations. There are so many people who always try to pull me into them. 
</P>
<P>
"If we truly believe Dr. King made this nation a better nation, . . . citizens 
of good will want to do -- in their own way -- the proper thing to recognize 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 800 students filled the Camino Hall auditorium to hear King's talk, 
sponsored by the USD's Associated Students, Faculty Social Issues Committee, 
and Women's Program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Gets Death Threats 
</P>
<P>
"The average one of you (students) is 19 to 20 years of age; that means you 
were not born, or being born, or just born when Martin Luther King Jr. was 
assassinated almost 20 years ago," King told the students. "Unless you've had 
the opportunity to learn about the civil rights movement and the history of the 
African American struggle in this country, it is pretty foreign and alien to 
you, particularly here in the West." 
</P>
<P>
King, who said that, after 30 years, she still gets death threats, reminisced 
about the desegregation effort in Alabama and the suffering of those committed 
to nonviolent demonstration. "We kept the faith in the American dream. 
Somewhere we read about this idea of democracy. . . . Somewhere, we got this 
notion that all men are created equal." 
</P>
<P>
King emphasized that changes in America's society have been made through the 
"suffering and sacrifices of individuals, black and white, American people of 
good will of all races." 
</P>
<P>
Although "clearly we've come a long way since the days of the civil rights 
movement," King cited injustices that still pervade our society, such as the 
fact that black college graduates earn less than white high school graduates, 
that racial conflicts have arisen on school campuses and the lack of blacks in 
key governmental positions. 
</P>
<P>
"We've come a long way in bringing people an awareness to what he stood for: 
principles of nonviolence, human rights, an example of human dignity and 
decency. He taught how to love unconditionally. That's important in a world 
context. . . . We have to understand and respect and appreciate people who are 
different from ourselves. That is what we really say America is all about. It 
is a home for all of God's children." 
</P>
<P>
King emphasized in her lecture that the principles of nonviolence can still 
work in the 1990s, and have recently been applied in the Philippines and in the 
struggle against apartheid in South Africa. "Nonviolence, when practiced . . . 
really works," she said. 
</P>
<P>
King, who noted that Wednesday was also International Women's Day, spoke on 
behalf of women's rights, and encouraged women to be leaders in a "bold, new 
vision" of a more peaceful world. "Women must be a moral vanguard for a more 
compassionate, humanitarian world community," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She also spoke Wednesday night on "Black-Jewish Relations: Conflict or 
Healing?" at Congregation Beth El in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Wes Pratt, who attended the USD lecture, said he was not 
disappointed that King refused to jump into the fray on the naming of the 
convention center. "This is a local issue, and it's up to the local community 
to recognize the contributions of Martin Luther King," Pratt said. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt said he intends to move that the issue be sent back to the Port District 
for a vote. "They begged the question; they should have voted it up or down, 
they dragged this thing out and offended a significant amount of people with 
the process."

RULES FOR NONPROFIT GROUPS; 
</P>
<P>
PANEL ACTS TO BAR POLITICS IN SPACE RENTED FROM CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego City Council committee Wednesday broadened rules against political 
activity by nonprofit organizations that rent subsidized, city-owned office and 
meeting space. 
</P>
<P>
In a 4-1 vote, the council's Public Facilities and Recreation Committee 
expanded its rules prohibiting campaign activity to include ballot 
propositions, issues and initiatives. Under the city's 10-year-old existing 
policy, the groups are prohibited from working for or against political 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The new regulations, which require a vote of the full San Diego City Council to 
take effect, do not forbid organization members from lobbying elected officials 
in pursuit of the group's goals. Nor would they bar political work that takes 
place outside city-subsidized office space. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Judy McCarty, a staunch supporter of the rule change, said the new 
language is intended to ensure that taxpayers' money does not indirectly 
support partisan political activity. 
</P>
<P>
"We're saying you can't go out and politicize and campaign on subsidized public 
property," McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Bob Filner, the lone dissenter in Wednesday's decision, said 
that the rules instruct groups that "they are not supposed to take positions on 
the major issues facing this city and this state. I think that's ridiculous 
that we are put into that position and that posture." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Free Speech Issue 
</P>
<P>
In January, the city attorney's office ruled that the regulations are legal, 
but an attorney representing the Sierra Club said Wednesday that the expanded 
rules are unconstitutional because the "city-owned buildings in question are a 
public forum" where free speech is protected by the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
The rules "diminish, albeit in small measure, one of the fundamental civil 
liberties guaranteed by our Constitution," said the attorney, Virginia 
Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
The vote ended eight months of committee debate, which began when the San Diego 
Business Journal accused the local Sierra Club chapter of meeting in 
subsidized, city-owned office space in Balboa Park to review an endorsement 
made by the organization's political arm. 
</P>
<P>
The policy would no longer apply to the Sierra Club because the chapter last 
month moved to privately owned quarters in North Park. Other groups that occupy 
city-subsidized space and have taken positions on past ballot initiatives 
include Citizens Coordinate for Century III and some of the cultural 
institutions in Balboa Park's core. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,200 nonprofit groups now pay less than fair-market rates to use 
city-owned office space, most of them for social or community meetings, said 
Don Barone, the city's property management services supervisor.

OUTRAGED RESIDENTS DON'T WANT TO DRY UP; 
</P>
<P>
LAKE MORENA'S DRAINING MAKES A LOT OF WAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Jerry McKee gazes angrily at the water on Lake Morena. 
</P>
<P>
"I can stand at my window and watch the water level drop every day," McKee said 
from the lakeside site where he is building his new home. 
</P>
<P>
As people like McKee try to figure out a way to save Lake Morena in southeast 
San Diego County, the city's Department of Water Utilities is emptying it at a 
rate of 15 million gallons a day. 
</P>
<P>
After Superior Court Judge William C. Pate ruled last month that draining the 
city-operated reservoir did not require an environmental impact report, the 
city opened the flood gates. Since then, the lake has dropped 10 inches and 
could continue to drop at least an inch a day for months, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Lake Morena Village residents are furious and plan to file a complaint with the 
state Water Resources Board alleging mismanagement of the water. A lawyer who 
represents the Lake Morena-Campo Chamber of Commerce said local residents are 
thinking about suing the city of San Diego for wasting taxpayers money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Large and Shallow 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the evaporation at the lake makes it impractical to keep it 
full and that Otay Reservoir, where the water is being sent, needs to be kept 
full in the event of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
"Morena is an inefficient reservoir because it is large and shallow. We have 
more evaporation at Morena than the other reservoirs . . . so it is to our 
advantage to have less water in Morena and more in the other lakes," said Will 
Sniffin, deputy director of water production for the Water Utilities 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The water is being transferred first to Lake Barrett and then to Otay Reservoir 
where a filtration plant treats the water before it is pumped into the city 
water system, Sniffin said. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how low will the lake get? Sniffin said it depends on the amount of 
rainfall and runoff. "At this point we can't tell you. . . . It will never be 
empty," he said. "We can only draft down to a certain point anyway." 
</P>
<P>
The city is studying the amount of sediment in the lake and may make efforts to 
remove it, depending on the study's results. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra Club spokeswoman Barbara Bamberger said the drafting would seriously 
affect local wildlife, including peregrine falcons and American bald eagles. 
"We don't feel (the drafting) is necessary because the evaporation rates in 
Lake Barrett are no better," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalist group's data shows evaporation rates for Lake Morena are 
actually lower than those at Lake Barrett or Otay Reservoir, Bamberger said. 
Sniffin countered that Lake Morena's larger surface area means more water 
evaporates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Water Rights 
</P>
<P>
Georgine Brave, the attorney representing the local chamber of commerce, said 
water has not been removed from Lake Morena for at least 10 years, allowing a 
large ecosystem to build up. She believes the city is transferring the water 
from the lake because a long-term agreement that calls for the county to pay 
the city for evaporated water has lapsed. The county owns the lake, but the 
city maintains limited water rights that allow it to transfer the water to Lake 
Barrett in an emergency. No emergency has been declared. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the draining is about money, not the need for water . . . no water 
emergency was declared," Brave said. "Why did they start to take the water now 
after all these years? We're saying that they've allowed an environment, this 
ecology, to build up and now they're taking the water without good reason." 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner McKee agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"What they've done is left it full for many, many years, and, when you do that, 
it creates an environment that's totally dependent on this body of water. Now 
you take it away and you destroy everything that's been created. Had they 
managed it over the last 10 years as a reservoir, if they had constantly drawn 
it down to what they call their minimum pool, this environment wouldn't have 
created around it," McKee said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Leach, president of the Lake Morena-Campo Chamber of Commerce, said the 
draining of the lake will hurt local businesses. "There's going to be less 
people coming here, and it's going to create a mosquito population like you 
wouldn't believe. People have been coming out and sinking their life savings 
into a home here. Their real estate value is going to go down, probably by a 
good deal," said Leach, who manages a Lake Morena real estate company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Agendas? 
</P>
<P>
Bamberger noted increased development around Otay Reservoir including plans to 
build a U. S. Olympic training center and said there was a "very good chance 
that there are other agendas in this effort." 
</P>
<P>
Sniffin denied that the city had a hidden agenda and dismissed complaints that 
transferring the water was destroying the lake. "All the reservoirs in San 
Diego County have been built for potable water purposes" and not necessarily 
recreation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County Supervisor George Bailey, whose district includes Lake Morena, 
was disappointed with Pate's ruling, one of his aides said. "What's disturbing 
to us is that, if all of Lake Morena was drained, it still would not solve the 
water problems in San Diego and it's nonsense to us that the city is destroying 
a major recreational facility because of (this). It's a Band-Aid approach to 
the problem," said Dianne Jacob, Bailey's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 visitors use Lake Morena for camping, boating and fishing every 
year, and 80% of them come from San Diego County, Jacob said. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Leach says he knows he could make more money managing a real 
estate office in downtown San Diego. "But I moved here because I love it here. 
When you drive around here, people wave at you. It's a real nice place to raise

A 20-year-old woman was killed Wednesday after her car was struck from behind 
on Interstate 5 while visibility was restricted by dense fog, the California 
Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Celia Perez of Southeast San Diego was northbound on I-5 just south of its 
junction with Interstate 805 at 5:20 a.m. when her car began to have mechanical 
problems, said Lloyd Needham of the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
Perez pulled onto the left-hand shoulder and was slowing when her car was 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the second car was taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in Chula 
Vista and treated for cuts and bruises, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Perez's sister, Maria, 22, and her 2-year-old daughter, both of whom were 
passengers, were also treated for bruises at Scripps and released, the 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident is under investigation.

The murder trial of David Lucas, who is accused of murdering six people, 
continued Wednesday with testimony by pathologist David Katsuyama of the County 
Coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Katsuyama performed the autopsy on Ann Swanke, whose throat was slashed and 
body left in a remote area of Spring Valley in 1984. According to Katsuyama, "a 
large gaping hole in Swanke's neck" was the cause of death. He also testified 
that a "relatively heavy, thick, long blade, three to four inches in length" 
was used to slash the USD student's throat. 
</P>
<P>
He also testified more than one stroke was used by Swanke's assailant in 
slashing her throat. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, 33, of Spring Valley is accused of murdering Swanke after she ran out of 
gas in La Mesa on November 19, 1984. Her body was found five days later on Nov. 
24.

Six hundred San Diego State University students were evacuated after two fires 
broke out in a basement of an eight-story dormitory hall, authorities said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters responded to the Zura dormitory in the 6100 block of Montezuma 
Road at 8:24 p.m. Tuesday and spotted the first fire in a basement dumpster, 
said Jon McDonald, a spokesman for the San Diego Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
After wheeling it outside and extinguishing the fire, however, firefighters 
found another blaze inside the wall next to a trash chute leading to the 
dumpster, McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
Additional firefighters were summoned, he said. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald said the cause of the fires was under investigation, but he added that 
the metal trash chute had a hole in it where the flames may have ignited. 
</P>
<P>
The Metro Arson Strike Team is investigating the fires. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's blaze was the third dumpster fire in the dormitory's basement in the 
past two semesters, said Jeff Urdahl, associate director of SDSU housing. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported.

YOU ASKED ABOUT: SALMON CANNED IN '72 CAN BE RISKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have inherited some canned salmon that was caught and preserved in 
1972 and 1973. The cans appear to be in good condition. Is this salmon still 
good? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It's recommended that canned foods be used within one to two years of 
purchase or preserving. After that length of time, the food begins to lose 
quality, even if it is still safe to consume. If the salmon is indeed as old as 
you state, we believe the old adage "when it doubt, throw it out" should be 
observed. In our opinion, it would not be worth the risk to consume this 
product. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have an old recipe that calls for a No. 303 size can of vegetables. How 
does this translate to ounces? 
</P>
<P>
A: In the past, cans were often designated by a name or number. Here is a list 
of the most common and the approximate net weight, yield in cups and number of 
servings for each: 
</P>
<P>
Picnic -- 10 1/2 to 12 ounces, 1 1/4 cups, 2 to 3 servings 
</P>
<P>
No. 300 -- 14 to 16 ounces, 1 3/4 cups, 3 to 4 servings 
</P>
<P>
No. 303 -- 16 to 17 ounces, 2 cups, 4 servings 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 -- 1 pound, 4 ounces or 1 pint, 2 fluid ounces; 2 1/2 cups, 5 servings 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 1/2 -- 1 pound, 13 ounces; 3 1/2 cups, 7 servings 
</P>
<P>
No. 3 -- 3 pounds, 3 ounces or 46 fluid ounces or 1 quart, 14 fluid ounces; 5 
3/4 cups, 10 to 12 servings 
</P>
<P>
No. 10 -- 6 1/2 to 7 1/4 pounds, 12 to 13 cups, 25 servings 
</P>
<P>
Q: I wanted to prepare that old-fashioned dessert recipe with the chocolate 
wafers and whipping cream, but I couldn't locate the wafers. Are they still 
available? And if so, where? 
</P>
<P>
A: Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers are still widely available, but some 
supermarkets stock them with the ice cream toppings rather than the cookies. 
The manufacturer tells us they may be found at Alpha Beta Co., Gelson's 
Markets, Lucky Stores Inc., The Pantry Inc., Stater Bros. Inc. and Vons Grocery 
Co. stores. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Please tell me why my cheesecake cracks before I loosen and remove it from 
the pan. 
</P>
<P>
A: We couldn't find a scientific explanation of why cheesecakes crack, but in 
"Cheesecakes -- Sweet and Savory," (HP Books: 1985) author Barbara Maher 
states: "Baked cheesecakes have a tendency to crack as they bake. These cracks 
may almost disappear as the cheesecake deflates and cools. This does not affect 
the texture or flavor. It is simply a characteristic of some baked 
cheesecakes." 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have several recipes calling for self-rising cornmeal. It doesn't seem to 
be available in the Southland, and I'm wondering whether the same formula used 
for substituting regular for self-rising flour will work: one cup flour, 1 1/2 
teaspoons baking powder and one-half teaspoon salt. Can you help? 
</P>
<P>
A: Your guesstimate is close. According to a spokesperson at Quaker Oats, 
manufacturers of Aunt Jemima self-rising white enriched cornmeal, the 
substitution formula for 1 cup of their self-rising cornmeal would be: 1/2 cup 
flour, 1/2 cup cornmeal, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt. 
Aunt Jemima self-rising cornmeal also contains fat, so in addition to the above 
ingredients, 2 tablespoons fat must be added for each cup of the self-rising 
cornmeal mixture used in a recipe.

BID TO GAIN ARMENIAN VOTER FOOTHOLD IN GLENDALE FALTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
After a four-week campaign to increase the Armenian presence in city politics, 
a Glendale-based Armenian political group this week was still far from 
achieving its goal. 
</P>
<P>
By the registration deadline Monday night, the Armenian National Committee, in 
its largest Glendale voter-registration drive ever, had added just 180 
Armenian-Americans to the list of the city's more than 65,000 registered 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very frustrating job," said Arick Grevorkian, chairman of the Armenian 
National Committee's Glendale chapter. "But the city needs it, and we need it." 
</P>
<P>
Registration for the April 4 municipal election closed Monday, as required by 
the state Election Code. 
</P>
<P>
Armenian-Americans constitute about one-fourth of Glendale's population of 
120,000, but they represent a small fraction of the registered voters. Only 
about 2,000 Armenian-Americans are registered, said Grevorkian, citing 
information from the Glendale Chamber of Commerce and local Armenian groups. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Grevorkian said, the registration drive, which also signed up about 70 
voters who did not identify themselves as Armenian-Americans, built a 
steppingstone to future Armenian National Committee involvement in municipal 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
"We're gaining experience," he said. "It's hard to deal with the public, but 
we're learning. Keep in mind, we're new in this business." 
</P>
<P>
He said the committee has been registering voters for years, but never 
attempted a drive as thorough as this year's. For the first time, he said, 35 
to 40 part-time volunteers spent four weeks knocking on doors, going to 
shopping malls and using telephone listings to register voters. 
</P>
<P>
The toughest obstacle the volunteers faced was changing the thinking of 
Armenian immigrants from the Soviet Union and the Middle East, who are not used 
to citizen involvement under authoritarian governments, he said. Grevorkian 
said the committee has been involved in Glendale politics at least since 1983, 
when Councilman Larry Zarian received the group's endorsement. In 1985, the 
committee endorsed Mayor Carl Raggio and Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg, both of 
whom are seeking reelection April 4. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the committee passed over the incumbents and endorsed 
challengers Berdj Karapetian, a former committee chairman, and real estate 
broker Joe Ayvazi. Karapetian and Ayvazi are two of three Armenians in the 
field of 13 candidates. The third is Richard Diradourian, who was not endorsed 
by the group. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, Grevorkian said, has grown disenchanted with the present 
council. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we have been ignored in the past year or so," he said. "When the 
earthquake devastated Soviet Armenia, for example, the council didn't bother to 
write a letter of condolence, or even make a phone call to say, 'What can I do 
for you?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shunning 'Back Seat' 
</P>
<P>
"We are no longer taking the back seat," he said. "The city can no longer 
ignore us." 
</P>
<P>
While the committee hopes to make the "Armenian factor" a key element in future 
elections, both candidates endorsed by the committee said the Armenian vote is 
not yet close to becoming a decisive factor in City Council races. 
</P>
<P>
Karapetian said the committee endorsement has helped him recruit volunteers, 
but will not be a major factor in the election. "Voters will support me for my 
positions on growth, traffic and senior citizen housing, not just because I've 
been involved with Armenian issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Karapetian contacted a private consulting firm to determine, among other 
things, the ethnic breakdown of the city's electorate. His results show that as 
few as 300 Armenian-Americans voted in the 1987 election. 
</P>
<P>
Ayvazi said the committee endorsement may carry "some weight," but he believes 
that most Armenians are "quite independent, and not very easily swayed by 
politicians and special interest groups."

VERMONT-LOS FELIZ GUIDELINES; 
</P>
<P>
PLANNING TEAM TACKLES AREA'S NAGGING PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Working Saturday through Tuesday, a team of architects, planners, designers, 
economists and students has produced a crash plan for improvements to the 
Vermont-Los Feliz area of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, printed and bound Wednesday, will be submitted to Los Angeles City 
Councilman Mike Woo today and the Los Angeles Planning Commission next 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Separate projects would then carry out its recommendations, which range from 
suggestions on broad design guidelines to the alteration of specific buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do is create some visual images that will excite and 
challenge those who have to take it to the next step," said Brenda Levin, 
co-facilitator of the four-day planning session. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Area Problems 
</P>
<P>
Although the plan has not yet been made public in detail, members of the team 
said they have proposed solutions to some of the nagging problems of the area, 
including a scarcity of parking in the business districts of Vermont and 
Hillhurst avenues and the isolation of Barnsdall Park. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual community planning session was the second of five by the Los 
Angeles Planning Department on a model developed by the American Institute of 
Architects. 
</P>
<P>
The first, in October, produced a plan for the Van Nuys civic center. 
</P>
<P>
The project, although partially funded by a grant from the National Endowment 
for the Arts, was largely accomplished with donated services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Consultants 
</P>
<P>
A dozen private consultants donated their time. 
</P>
<P>
Several USC planning and design students also volunteered to draw lot-by-lot, 
three-dimensional maps of the area under study. 
</P>
<P>
The area is bounded by Los Feliz Boulevard on the north, Commonwealth Avenue on 
the east and Sunset Boulevard on the south. The western boundary moves from 
Rodney Drive south of Los Feliz west to New Hampshire Avenue south of Franklin 
Avenue and to Kenmore Avenue south of Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The study process involved interviews with residents and business owners in the 
area, followed by brainstorming sessions to render their suggestions into 
planning and design ideas. 
</P>
<P>
The work was all done in a vacant storefront on Vermont Avenue. Los Angeles 
planning officials moved in phones, copying machines and printers. Two 
carpenters' unions donated tables. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 interview subjects came in groups of up to 10 all day Saturday and 
Sunday. A panel of interviewers -- mostly architects and designers -- asked 
each of them questions about the neighborhood and its problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interview Subjects 
</P>
<P>
Several people said they prized the area for its small, unusual businesses 
frequented largely by the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Among the problems identified were lack of parking on business streets, traffic 
intrusion and the construction of buildings that detract from the orientation 
of Vermont and Hillhurst as walking streets. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, several merchants cited the post office across from the Los 
Feliz Theatre on Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
That was the kind of problem the expert panel believed that it could help 
solve. 
</P>
<P>
The post office building "poked a great big hole in the retail," said 
industrial designer Ben Stansbury. "We're going to fix it." 
</P>
<P>
Stansbury said the group would recommend facing the building with something 
such as a newsstand to create a retail feel that would encourage pedestrians to 
keep walking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Collaborative Process 
</P>
<P>
But Stansbury couldn't promise an immediate fix. 
</P>
<P>
"The federal government can be a difficult collaborative partner," he said. 
However, he said, the crash planning process tends to help things happen by 
getting bureaucrats from different jurisdictions talking about the same 
problems at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"If you do it all at once, then everybody is enthusiastic," he said. "They will 
give it that little bit of extra energy." 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a catalytic event," said Emily Gabel, principal planner for the 
city. "The merchants aren't organized in this area. When they left, they were 
talking to each other."

$1.4 MILLION EARMARKED FOR HOUSING THE NEEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of delay, the Glendale Redevelopment Agency this week accepted a 
state mandate to set aside tax revenue from its booming downtown redevelopment 
zone for low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
Agency members Tuesday voted unanimously to allocate $1.4 million -- 20% of the 
estimated $7 million in property taxes that the city will earn this year from 
its redevelopment zone -- toward providing city-subsidized housing for low- and 
moderate-income families and senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The action marks the first time the city has set aside its own funds, rather 
than using federal and state grants and subsidies, to finance housing for the 
needy. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, provisions of state laws allowed the city to circumvent measures 
designed to force local governments to provide affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legislation Takes Effect 
</P>
<P>
But state legislation that became effective this year requires Glendale, and 
all other cities in the state with redevelopment zones, to either set aside a 
portion of its redevelopment revenue or accrue a debt for low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
Since the city has prided itself on its ability to avoid municipal 
indebtedness, officials agreed to allocate the required funds, although how the 
money will actually be used to help the needy is not expected to be determined 
for at least several months. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John F. Day, the lone Democrat on the five-member board that also 
serves as the City Council, said the action is long overdue. He said the city 
has "a moral obligation, if not a legal obligation" to provide low-cost 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd had my druthers, it would have been done two years ago," said Day, who 
voiced the only opposition when the city took advantage of legal provisions 
that initially permitted deferment of housing obligations until 1997. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Affordable Housing Pushed 
</P>
<P>
The state for years has urged local agencies to set aside tax increment funds 
from redevelopment zones for affordable housing. Increment taxes are funds 
generated by the higher values that occur when an area is redeveloped. Instead 
of being collected by the county for distribution to various local government 
agencies, however, the funds are kept within the redevelopment zone, to be 
spent on more improvements there. 
</P>
<P>
Council members in recent years have expressed growing concern about the plight 
of senior citizens who live on meager incomes in a city without rent control. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,400 elderly -- most of them longtime Glendale residents -- are on 
waiting lists for subsidized housing, according to a report issued last year by 
the Mayor's Task Force on Housing for the Elderly. 
</P>
<P>
But at least twice that number of low- and moderate-income families, often 
minorities, also are in need of low-cost housing, said Mayor Carl Raggio. He 
said the needs of the whole community must be assessed before determining 
allocation of funds for housing. On Tuesday, he called for a "rational split" 
of funds among low-income seniors and families. 
</P>
<P>
Raggio's stance has not been popular in conservative Glendale, where residents 
have rallied behind projects for needy seniors but have resisted housing for 
low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Larry Zarian, for instance, asked city officials this week if the 
city has adequate procedures to weed out welfare recipients who, because of 
increased income, no longer qualify for benefits. "This type of program could 
become a habit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yearly Qualification 
</P>
<P>
Madalyn Blake, director of community development and housing, assured Zarian 
that all residents who receive rent subsidies must qualify annually for the 
funds. As an example, she said, a family whose income has increased because a 
previously unemployed spouse or child has found work would no longer receive 
federal or state assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Before the housing funds are allocated, Blake said, the city first must assess 
the needs of low-income families and seniors. She said a report and 
recommendations will be brought back to the redevelopment agency "within a 
couple of months." 
</P>
<P>
Among uses the city is considering are expansion of the housing voucher 
program, acquisition of land and construction of subsidized housing projects 
and rehabilitation of substandard units in the city. 
</P>
<P>
City officials in 1986 pledged to allocate $550,000 in redevelopment funds and 
to donate land valued at $975,000 for a senior citizen housing complex proposed 
by Soroptimist International of Glendale, a professional women's service 
organization. But that plan never materialized because the money pledged was 
insufficient, and the Soroptimists lacked the expertise to undertake the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$7 Million Federal Award 
</P>
<P>
The Soroptimists have since formed a partnership with Southern California 
Presbyterian Homes, a nonprofit organization experienced in housing 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The new partnership in September was awarded more than $7 million in federal 
funds to build a proposed 75-unit development for the elderly on city-owned 
land at Louise Street and Monterey Road. 
</P>
<P>
Blake said a portion of the city's redevelopment funds set aside this week may 
now be used for the Soroptimist project, to offset land acquisition costs and 
to provide amenities such as balconies, which are not funded by federal money. 
</P>
<P>
The city also is considering building a low-cost housing project on two 
adjoining city-owned lots at 549 and 605 E. Palmer Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale officials said the city will have to be cautious in developing a plan 
for spending its housing funds because private citizen groups in a few other 
cities have filed law suits challenging the legality of the purported use of 
housing money.

Former Planning Commissioner Gregory Slaughter easily defeated four other 
candidates Tuesday to win the City Council seat vacated by the death of 
Dorothea Lombardo. 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter won with 1,811 votes, followed by former Councilman Henry C. Gonzales 
with 1,467, Jerry Garcia with 254, David (Eddie) Frantz with 172, and Rogelio 
Cuevas with 10. 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter, a Santa Monica police officer, promoted himself as a tough-on-crime 
candidate who wanted to expand the city's police force to combat an increasing 
gang problem. Slaughter also questioned the integrity of Gonzales, who 
challenged the results of last April's council election in which Lombardo 
defeated him by 7 votes. 
</P>
<P>
"The voters indicated they wanted a change in April, 1988," Slaughter said. 
"They are re-emphasizing that change with my election." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter said one of his priorities will be to reopen the State Street fire 
station, which was closed by Los Angeles County fire protection officials after 
the city refused to pay increased service fees. He also said he will work to 
establish police substations, one on the south side and another on the west 
side of the city, to deal with South Gate's growing crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
The new councilman said he will be making some changes in Lombardo's appointees 
to city commissions. Planning Commissioner Lillie Guastavino, who died last 
week, will be replaced by Johnny Ramirez, a South Gate resident and manager of 
a savings and loan institution in Marina del Rey, Slaughter said. He also plans 
to make one or two changes among Lombardo's four appointees to the city 
Citizen's Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, who served on the council from 1982 to 1988, said Wednesday that he 
has not decided whether he will seek public office again. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council decided to hold a special election rather than appoint a 
council member after Lombardo, a longtime local activist, died in November. 
Slaughter, 41, will be sworn in Tuesday evening and complete Lombardo's term, 
which expires in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The voter turnout of 3,754 for the special election -- about 21% of those 
registered -- "was pretty good, for us," City Clerk Janet Stubbs said. About 
22% of city voters turned out for the April, 1988, council election, she said.

BELL GARDENS CITES ANOTHER LANDLORD IN CRACKDOWN ON 'SLUM-LIKE' HOUSING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As part of a citywide crackdown on deteriorating rental property, city 
officials have charged a Huntington Park businessman with allowing dozens of 
low-income tenants in two apartment complexes he owns to live in "slum-like" 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
In a 14-count complaint filed Monday at Huntington Park Municipal Court, Wafick 
Zaky was charged with allowing a long list of unsafe conditions to exist for 
the past year, city prosecutor Cary Reisman said. 
</P>
<P>
Reisman said Zaky has repeatedly ignored city officials' orders to correct 
several dozen health and safety code violations, some serious enough to 
endanger the health of tenants in apartments on Loveland Street and Ajax 
Avenue, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"We're determined that it's not going to be profitable to maintain slum-like 
conditions in Bell Gardens," City Manager Claude Booker said. 
</P>
<P>
But a representative for Zaky, in a telephone interview on Tuesday, denied that 
his boss has been uncooperative with city officials or has allowed the 13 
apartment units to become rundown and unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
Zaky is one of 18 absentee landlords that city officials cited this week for a 
variety of code violations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite "numerous opportunities" and a conference last year in which city 
building inspectors outlined the various alleged violations to the landlords, 
Reisman said, they have not complied with city orders to upgrade their rental 
property. 
</P>
<P>
The violations, which date back to April, 1988, range from excessive trash 
accumulation to major building defects, such as exposed electrical wiring, 
rotting floors and collapsing ceilings, Booker said. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to do it by sugar and honey, but that didn't work," Booker said. "It 
got to the point where it was obvious that we were not going to get 
compliance." 
</P>
<P>
The other landlords face between two and seven charges each. Each offense is 
punishable by a $1,000 fine, six months in County Jail and other penalty 
assessments based on the condition of the property. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those charged were arraigned on Monday at Huntington Park Municipal 
Court. Six failed to appear, two pleaded guilty, two face a preliminary hearing 
on March 28 and arraignments for the remainder were continued to various dates. 
Bench warrants were issued for the six who failed to appear. 
</P>
<P>
City officials describe Zaky as the greatest offender. He is scheduled to 
reappear for arraignment on March 28, Reisman said. If convicted of all 
charges, he could face more than $30,000 in fines and seven years in County 
Jail, Reisman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope (the criminal charges) send a strong message to those who might follow 
in his footsteps," Reisman said. 
</P>
<P>
Emad Ghargory, head of Zaky's rental property business, said that the city has 
been unfair to his employer and other landlords. While acknowledging that there 
have been numerous problems that have cropped up over the years, he claimed 
that Zaky has a crew on duty six days a week for routine maintenance and 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to make derogatory comments toward the city of Bell Gardens," 
Ghargory said, "but in all honesty, this is all grossly unfair. I do not agree 
that these things . . . don't get fixed in time." 
</P>
<P>
Zaky also owns rental property in Huntington Park, San Pedro, Downey and Palm 
Springs, Ghargory said. Ghargory said that Zaky's company has had no complaints 
in any other city. He added that this is the first time Zaky's attorney has had 
to fight Bell Gardens about such charges at the Loveland and Ajax properties, 
which he has owned for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Ghargory said that the burden of responsibility should be shared by the 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sure these people (tenants) did not rent the properties in the condition 
that the city is alleging they are in," Ghargory said. "It is unfair that the 
city asks for a 24-hour monitor to make sure the tenants put their garbage in 
the bins all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Ghargory also said that the company has spent more than $20,000 upgrading the 
apartment complexes, both inside and outside. The parking lot at the Ajax 
Avenue complex was recently repaved and the apartments underwent a roof 
renovation. 
</P>
<P>
But city inspector Carlos Levario said he visited Zaky's apartment complexes on 
Sunday and took photographs. He said he found holes in walls, missing 
floorboards, loose and dangling wiring, cracked and leaking water faucets, 
missing bathtub tiling and broken windows. 
</P>
<P>
"One tenant tripped (in a hole in a floor) while she was showing me around," 
Levario said. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy (Zaky) insists that it is not his fault. He's definitely responsible 
for his property. If he can find his way to the place to collect the rent, then 
he should know what condition the place is in." 
</P>
<P>
Several of Zaky's tenants interviewed at the Loveland apartment complex shared 
Levario's view. 
</P>
<P>
Nellie Limon, who has lived in a three-bedroom apartment with her husband and 
four children for the past five years, said that the family often makes 
repairs. But some problems are too difficult for the family to handle, and they 
remain uncorrected for years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't come to fix anything," Limon said. "He only comes to pick up the 
rent." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Years-Old Damage 
</P>
<P>
She pointed to a collapsing ceiling, damaged by rain water, in a bedroom, 
saying that the damage had remained uncorrected for three years. 
</P>
<P>
Next door, Hilda Padilla complained that her bathroom faucets have been leaking 
for years, causing the wooden floor to rot. 
</P>
<P>
About two weeks ago, she said, she stepped out of the shower and a portion of 
the floor collapsed beneath her. She said she has told Zaky's maintenance crew, 
but the floor hasn't been repaired. 
</P>
<P>
"It just opened up," said Padilla, 25, pointing to the hole. The hole in the 
floor next to the bathtub revealed a dusty crawl space. 
</P>
<P>
Ghargory said he was aware of all these problems, including Padilla's rotting 
floor, and that the three-member crew has been scheduled to make the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
City officials launched a similar campaign to force absentee landlords to clean 
up their property in December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 18 charges that were filed against a number of absentee landlords, only 
one went to a jury trial, Reisman said. 
</P>
<P>
Landlord Victor Vaillette of Huntington Beach, who publishes Rent Guide 
Magazine, was convicted on four counts of health and safety violations, and was 
fined $2,700 and sentenced to 20 days in County Jail, said Reisman. Vaillette 
also was ordered to build a carport and fix a leaky roof. 
</P>
<P>
Vaillette, who is representing himself, has appealed. His case is scheduled to 
be heard in four months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vaillette also complained that city officials have been unfair to landlords. He 
said that he was not informed about specific charges of health and safety code 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 100% behind improving Bell Gardens," said Vaillette, adding that he has 
recently moved back into the property that the city found to be substandard in 
1986. "But I don't think the city acted properly in helping me make the 
necessary repairs I needed to make. 
</P>
<P>
"I had some very severe tenant problems," Vaillette said. "Now they want me to 
pay."

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: A SALON AS PRACTICED BY THE COMMITTEE IS A MUSICAL 
RECITAL IN A PRIVATE HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Fourteen-year-old harpist Su-Jin Shin of Westlake Village will debut before the 
Glendale crowd Sunday evening as soloist with the Glendale Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The concert will be in downtown Los Angeles in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
But Shin gave a hometown preview last Thursday at the customary salon put on by 
the symphony's Women's Committee before two or three of the symphony's 
performances each season. 
</P>
<P>
A salon as practiced by the committee is a musical recital in a private home. 
If Glendale is without an impressive concert hall for its orchestra, it is not 
lacking in dwellings worthy of that genteel tradition. 
</P>
<P>
The home of Dr. John Vogt and his wife Nancy is just about as impressive as the 
Los Angeles Music Center, if on a smaller scale. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Vogts bought it, the home belonged to John Lawson, founder of Valley 
National Bank. The house is on Cumberland Road, just down the street from Brand 
Park. The neighborhood is rich with period houses, many quite large, including 
one so bedecked with Southern plantation imagery that it is reputed -- 
erroneously -- to be the house filmed as Tara in "Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
The Vogts' house is of a more conservative colonial style. It is set on a high, 
grassy hill terraced for a sweeping driveway that climbs to the foot of a 
concrete stairway flanked by flower beds and trees that have clearly received 
the best of care for generations. 
</P>
<P>
The house is decorated with antiques, statuary and gilt-framed paintings of 
Renaissance country scenes. In the living room, two black grand pianos stand 
side by side. Nancy Vogt and her daughter play duets on them. 
</P>
<P>
Their keyboards were closed Thursday. Near them, in a large foyer connecting 
the living and dining rooms, stood a gold and black harp. Folding chairs were 
placed in tight rows in the two adjoining rooms, forming seating sections that 
projected at right angles. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 members of the Women's Committee and guests -- almost exclusively 
husbands -- filled the two rooms with light conversation as they settled into 
their chairs. Most were at least middle-aged. Only one or two couples appeared 
to be under 40. 
</P>
<P>
Circulating among them was the indefatigable Argentine-born composer and 
conductor Lalo Schifrin. A frequent guest conductor for the Glendale Symphony, 
Schifrin had introduced the young star to the orchestra after discovering her 
through the Young Musicians Foundation, of which he is musical director. 
</P>
<P>
Schifrin couldn't stay for her performance, however. Making apologies, he 
whirled out the door shortly before 8 for another engagement, leaving the 
spotlight to the night's young performer. 
</P>
<P>
Shin, the daughter of Korean immigrants, has been playing the harp since she 
was 10 under her mother's guidance. She won the Los Angeles Philharmonic's 
Bronislav Kaper Award in 1987 and is soon headed to Israel to take on 
international competition. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Glendale audience, she was an easy winner. 
</P>
<P>
Salon Chairman Elba Riffel, in a stunning blue dress with a beaded floral 
neckline, introduced her as "a really lovely lady." 
</P>
<P>
With complete aplomb, Shin stood up in a pink satin and lace dress, made by her 
mother. Both parents, Sabrina and Alexander, sat in the front row. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking only enough to name the first piece, Shin began Sonata in D Major by 
John Parry. 
</P>
<P>
The sound was strong and confident. Showing scant emotion, Shin built rigorous 
melodies upon the familiar, airily sweet undertones of the instrument. 
</P>
<P>
"You're a wonderful audience," she said, acknowledging the vigorous applause. 
</P>
<P>
She played three more pieces, the last a long and difficult composition by 
Tournier. Afterward, Riffel produced a bouquet of roses. 
</P>
<P>
"You are wonderful," Riffel said. "You make me cry." 
</P>
<P>
Then the group broke for sandwiches, pastries and coffee, prepared by the salon 
committee and laid out copiously on a long table in the breakfast room. 
Standing at her father's side, Su-Jin Shin received her audience for about half 
an hour. Then her father took her home. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Sabrina Shin had taken over the kitchen. Standing at the sink, yellow 
plastic gloves on her hands, she washed dishes vigorously as the women of the 
salon committee brought them to her. 
</P>
<P>
When there were no more, she took off the gloves and looked out the kitchen 
window to where her station wagon was parked. 
</P>
<P>
She had to ask one of the committee women's husbands to move his car. 
</P>
<P>
"While I wait I . . . ," she said, and instead of finishing the sentence, 
merely put the gloves back on and tackled a two-foot-long platter over the 
sink. 
</P>
<P>
That done, she produced a handcart from a closet and approached the harp. At 6 
feet tall, it had about a foot on her. 
</P>
<P>
"They say it is approximately 90 pounds," she said. "I know it is more than 
that." 
</P>
<P>
She secured the instrument with a Velcro strap. John Vogt, the host, helped her 
guide it through the dining room, out a back door, down a step and across a 
lawn. 
</P>
<P>
The two of them lifted it into the station wagon bay. 
</P>
<P>
At last, the night's work was done.

<P>
Students throughout the Southland distinguished themselves in the first round 
of California's first Citizen Bee. 
</P>
<P>
On March 4, 234 students from 86 high schools in Southern California fielded 
questions about American government, history, geography, economics and current 
events in regional playoffs of the Citizen Bee. Participants had previously won 
contests at their schools. The nationwide civics competition is organized by 
the Close Up Foundation of Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
First-place winners in the 11 regional competitions will proceed to a statewide 
contest, which will be held April 22 in Los Angeles. The three top state 
winners will compete with other state winners in the national competition in 
June in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
The top regional winners took home prizes of $500. The state winner will win 
$1,000, plus a $2,500 scholarship. The three top finishers in the state will 
also receive all-expense-paid trips to Washington for the finals. The national 
winner will receive a $7,000 college scholarship. 
</P>
<P>

GLENDALE VOTE TO BE MARCH 28; 
</P>
<P>
POPULATION LIMITS IN NEW ZONING URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After listening to a staff report on proposed zoning changes, three members of 
the Glendale City Council said Tuesday that the draft ordinance is not tough 
enough and will need additional restrictions on population growth to get their 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance, prepared by the Planning Department at the council's 
request, would require smaller buildings, more landscaping and more parking in 
all new apartments, condominiums and townhouses. 
</P>
<P>
City Planning Director John McKenna and Senior Planner James Glazer introduced 
the proposed changes to the council in a study session Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance is a slightly modified version of an earlier draft 
prepared by the staff in November. After several delays, the council scheduled 
the vote on the zoning changes for March 28, only days before the April 4 
municipal election. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the vote has fueled suspicion among some developers that the 
council deliberately postponed acting on the changes to give the reelection 
campaigns of Mayor Carl Raggio and Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg a last-minute 
boost. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very apparent that they're playing it up for the elections," said Hak 
Vartanian, the spokesman for a group of developers who call themselves the Fair 
Growth Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aesthetic Standards Cited 
</P>
<P>
Council members said the proposed changes would improve the aesthetic standards 
required from all new residential buildings, but would fall short of reducing 
the influx of new citizens to a level that the city would be able to 
accommodate. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason we are doing what we are doing," said Councilman Jerold Milner, "is 
to regulate population density. I think we all got caught up with the 
aesthetics and lost sight of the real goal." 
</P>
<P>
Milner called the draft ordinance "totally inadequate." He said the proposed 
changes would still allow for the construction of "three times as many housing 
units as we can afford." 
</P>
<P>
Citing data from the County Assessor's records, Milner said the proposed 
ordinance would allow a population growth of 80,000 above the city's current 
population of 160,000 -- if all the city's residential property were fully 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the number of automobiles and the number of people using 
schools and city services," he said, "we can't handle more than 200,000 
inhabitants." 
</P>
<P>
Raggio and Bremberg echoed Milner's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gotta be tougher," said Bremberg, referring to the proposed ordinance. "I 
don't feel that the proposal reduces the potential for a large population 
increase." 
</P>
<P>
Raggio said he likes the proposal but has "some concerns" about the extent to 
which it would "reduce the number of people per square foot."

SIMI VOTERS OK FUNDS FOR SCHOOL RENOVATION, BUT NOT FOR NEW GYMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Simi Valley voters approved a $35-million bond issue to renovate aging schools 
and narrowly rejected an $8-million measure that would have provided funds to 
build gymnasiums and an auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Measures A and B had to be approved by more than two-thirds of the voters to 
gain passage. Measure A, which will provide $35 million for new heating and 
air-conditioning systems for the district's 27 schools, passed with 7,096 
votes, or 70.4%. 
</P>
<P>
But Measure B, which would have provided $8 million for new construction, only 
garnered 6,630 votes, or 65.9%, just short of the two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout Tuesday was a light 21.3% in the special election. There were 
48,467 people eligible to vote, but only 10,309 ballots were cast. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. John Duncan said school officials will decide Friday or Monday, after the 
results have been officially tabulated, whether to ask for a recount. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just too close to rely on the machines correctly counting the ballots," 
Duncan said. "What this means is we'll be able to fix our schools and get a tax 
break, but not be able to build anything." 
</P>
<P>
In April, Simi Valley voters rejected a $35-million bond issue by 147 votes. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the district campaigned aggressively for the bond issues. A citizens 
committee supporting the measures recruited more than 200 volunteers, and 
raised more than $6,000 to hire a political consultant and pay for other 
campaign expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Property taxes will decrease with passage of Measure A, Duncan said. 
Legislation sponsored by Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and signed 
into law last month extends the district's repayment of existing state loans. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, even with payments for the new bonds, the annual school taxes on a 
$100,000 home will drop from $113 per year to $88 per year. Tax rates will drop 
again after 1994, when the existing state loan is repaid.

REDEVELOPMENT AGENDA OKD FOR LA CANADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA TURNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The La Canada Flintridge Redevelopment Agency identified four areas of concern 
for future agency meetings and set up a tentative schedule that will carry 
redevelopment discussions into at least late spring or early summer. 
</P>
<P>
The agency agreed to discuss the topics at regularly scheduled meetings 
beginning at the second meeting in April. City staff will research the topics 
and report back to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Whether La Canada Flintridge will be able to avoid building low-income housing 
within the city limits and still qualify for redevelopment funds will be the 
first topic addressed. 
</P>
<P>
Other agency items include a discussion of the method of determining property 
valuation increases for the city, a review of redevelopment laws regarding 
blight and examples of blight within La Canada Flintridge, and the agency's 
power of property condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Constant Concern 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, these four items have been brought up a number of times in 
discussions," City Manager Don Otterman said, "and I think these are areas 
where there are still concerns." 
</P>
<P>
The housing fund has been the subject of debate for months. State law requires 
that 20% of all tax increment money received by a redevelopment agency be used 
for building and maintaining low-income housing within the community. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city has been looking for ways to meet state requirements while 
appeasing those who object to building low-income housing within city limits. 
</P>
<P>
A bill to exempt certain communities from the 20% housing fund requirement was 
recently introduced in the state Legislature. Under that proposal, the money 
would be used for building low-income housing on adjacent county property, 
rather than within city limits.

ANGER OVER PUBLIC FUNDS FOR BOARDING SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is in response to the article (Jan. 26) written by Jesse Katz on the use 
of public funds to send a dyslexic girl to an expensive boarding school in 
Massachusetts. In that article, he also mentioned my frustrating situation in 
not being able to get adequate services for my learning-disabled child. 
</P>
<P>
My hat is off to Katz for bringing this to the public eye. The public has a 
right to know where its tax dollars are going. 
</P>
<P>
I find myself very angry at this outrageous injustice. Here I am, with a 
beautiful child with medical needs, whom I love as much as any parent with 
money, and I can't get him the help he needs. It seems if you have money and 
position, you not only can get help, but you can get somebody else to pay for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Further, I cannot believe that their child could not have been well-served 
within Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
But the thing that bothers me the most, besides the obvious abuse of the system 
and the belief that at least a dozen children could have gotten services for 
what is being spent on only one child, is how anyone can truly believe that it 
is in the best interest of the child to be sent to the opposite end of the 
country, away from her parents.

RE-EVALUATING COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After having read several scathing articles in Ventura County newspapers about 
Santa Clara's Coach Lou Cvijanovich, it was refreshing to read the March 2 
article in The Times' Ventura County section. The article was highly 
informative about Coach C's past history. This article was the epitome of what 
a coach should be to high school sports, to the past and present players, and 
to the parents of players and students at Santa Clara High School. 
</P>
<P>
If the people who have so quickly denounced Coach C publicly would take the 
time to read the article in The Times, we are sure that in the sense of 
fairness a re-evaluation may take place. The act of removing a team from a 
tournament that precipitated the indignation by the county's newspapers was not 
evaluated in its entirety. If the "slap on the wrist" as depicted by the county 
sports pages that Santa Clara and Coach C received from the CIF was not 
sufficient punishment, could it be that some pertinent questions were not asked 
by our county newspapers? 
</P>
<P>
Were the officials (refereeing the tournament) properly assigned by the area 
supervisor in charge of this task? What were the officials' qualifications? 
Were the officials paid the "going rate" as dictated by the CIF? Did, in fact, 
any of the county newspapers ask or research any of these questions? 
</P>
<P>
In reference to The Times' series of articles during the decision-making 
process of punishment by the CIF, at least one of these important questions was 
answered. These answers negated the probability of any severe punishment of the 
Saints team or the coach. Had the severity of punishment differed, the CIF 
would have been subject to review by others in the interest of justice. 
</P>
<P>
Our two sons have attended Santa Clara High School because of the qualities 
exemplified by Coach Cvijanovich and the Santa Clara staff. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you very much for your past coverage of Santa Clara High School. Best of 
luck to Camarillo's Bubba Burrage and both boys' and girls' teams in the state 
basketball tournaments.

SANTA CLARA FAVORED TO REPEAT AS CHAMPION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball coaches rarely agree, but they are unanimous once again in their 
selection of Santa Clara High as the favorite in the Frontier League this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
John Lorenzana, the Santa Clara coach, might be the lone dissenter. How can his 
team be favored, he would ask, when he lost pitchers the caliber of Mike Teron 
and Richard Mendez to graduation? And how can the Saints be favored to repeat 
when their catcher and shortstop haven't yet set foot on the diamond? 
</P>
<P>
Well, to begin with, opposing coaches point to the quality of the catcher and 
shortstop, both of whom are playing basketball on the Santa Clara team that has 
advanced to the state playoffs. Catcher Kasha Clemons had 16 runs batted in 
last season and switch-hitting shortstop Kwinn Knight had 14. Both have added 
enough strength to hit with power. 
</P>
<P>
As for replacing Teron and Mendez, who were a combined 14-4 last season, there 
is Tim Gutierrez. That's the same Gutierrez who set a state passing record for 
accuracy last football season. It's no surprise he is a control pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't have a lot of speed, he's more into breaking stuff," Lorenzana said 
of the junior right-hander. "He likes to use the plate. He's a spot pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzana believes it takes control pitching to take control of the league 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our league gets by with less speed and smarter pitching," said 
Lorenzana, whose team was 18-4 overall last season and 11-1 in league play. 
"Mike Teron didn't help us with his speed. He helped us when he was throwing 
strikes." 
</P>
<P>
Garth Teron, Mike's sophomore brother, will start in right field. Another 
sophomore, Joel Herrera, will start at second base and bat leadoff. 
</P>
<P>
"He's fundamentally sound," said Lorenzana of Herrera, although he could have 
been speaking of the Santa Clara program. No matter how many excellent players 
graduate, the replacements are ready. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura (10-10-2 overall, 5-5-2 in league play) and Calabasas (9-11-2, 5-5-2) 
appear to have the best chances of knocking off Santa Clara. Santa Paula is in 
a rebuilding mode, Nordhoff must scramble out of the league basement and new 
member Santa Ynez is an unknown quantity. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura relies offensively on junior third baseman Brian Smith, who batted .431 
with 27 RBIs last season. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Dave Aronowitz is the only experienced pitcher but catcher Josh Smaler, 
second baseman Nelson Townes and outfielders Mark Costas and Chris Pittinger 
are returning starters. 
</P>
<P>
Returning for Calabasas are third baseman Eric Umemoto, pitcher Dan Glassman 
and catcher Dave Kalman, who batted .442 last year and was an all-league 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
Glassman, who was 4-4 with a 2.80 earned-run average and 70 strikeouts in 50 
innings, should be reliable. Senior Scott Faer, junior Eric Rothman and 
freshman Brett Farlow round out the pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
Nordhoff (5-12, 3-9) lost its final seven games last year, but the five 
sophomores in the lineup gained valuable experience. The best of the group are 
shortstop Rob Fournier, who batted .313 last season, and outfielder/pitcher 
Trevor Matheson, who batted .357. 
</P>
<P>
"Rob is one of the better shortstops I've seen," Coach Mark Capritto said. 
"We're counting on him and Trevor to do a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
Also returning are juniors Jim McBride (first base) and Jayden Morrison 
(outfield). Matt Savard, another junior, was the top hitter on the junior 
varsity and could become the designated-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Seymour, a junior left-handed pitcher, transferred to Nordhoff from 
Ventura and will join the rotation within two weeks. "He's the first 
left-hander we've had since 1981," Capritto said. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Jeremy Anthony will catch and Steve Blundell, a senior and perhaps the 
best athlete at the school, is back after being academically ineligible last 
year. Blundell will pitch and have a place in the lineup the rest of the time. 
"Steve has a good bat," Capritto said. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Jacinto resigned as Santa Paula coach to concentrate on his duties as 
athletic director and has been replaced by Mark Magdaleno. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula (8-12, 5-7) has several sophomores in the lineup including 
Magdaleno's nephew, outfielder Dustin Magdaleno. Other sophomores include 
catcher Martin Rios and third baseman Ramon Flores. Senior Chris Cole 
(shortstop) and juniors Tom Frutos (first base) and Alex Cerda (second) are 
returning starters. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching for Santa Paula will be Manuel Herrera, a junior who was MVP of the 
junior varsity last year, Mario Gonzales and Flores.

U.S. BISHOPS ASK PONTIFF FOR VATICAN UNDERSTANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
VATICAN CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an outspoken appeal for Vatican understanding, American bishops warned Pope 
John Paul II on Wednesday that an authoritarian church alienates U.S. Roman 
Catholics who "consider that the divine right of bishops is as outmoded as the 
divine right of kings." 
</P>
<P>
An extraordinary four-day meeting between 36 American prelates and the Pope to 
discuss the changing role of bishops in the United States opened with powerful 
statements from two U.S. delegates challenging the Vatican to better comprehend 
the American church as an integral part of a singular pluralistic society. 
</P>
<P>
"As U.S. bishops, we value highly the founding principles of our country and 
its democratic traditions," Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, co-moderator of 
the meeting, told a press conference. "I do not see these freedoms or their 
exercise as being in conflict with our faithfulness to the universal, Catholic 
tradition that is ours." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardin's remarks and a subsequent address by Archbishop John L. May, 
president of the National Conference of Bishops, signaled the reluctance of 
American prelates to quietly accept dictates from the Vatican. The meeting is 
advertised by both sides as non-confrontational, but there were clear 
differences of opinion Wednesday as the Americans made plain they would be 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
"Today I think the Vatican understands how the Polish government must feel when 
Lech Walesa preaches solidarity," observed a theologian close to the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the scenes, there was scuffling over how much of the proceedings should 
be made public. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans argued for public release of remarks that individual U.S. bishops 
have prepared for 10 give-and-take sessions with the Pope. A cardinal from the 
Curia, the Vatican's administrative arm, will also address each session, but 
the Vatican had planned for its spokesman to summarize the sessions for 
reporters without publicizing either American or Vatican texts. Whether the 
remarks will be officially forthcoming as the meeting progresses was unresolved 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Clash of Cultures' 
</P>
<P>
"The question of how much to say publicly is a good example of the clash of 
cultures that is the context for the meeting: American openness versus Vatican 
reticence," said an American priest who has lived in Rome for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
On a rainy afternoon, the Pope welcomed the Americans in a brief address 
calling for "a truly open exchange which aims to strengthen our partnership in 
the Gospel." Speaking in English, John Paul praised the bishops' "pastoral 
zeal" and urged them to be steadfast in "bringing the Gospel message to a world 
that does not often readily accept it." 
</P>
<P>
Then, with the Pope listening, came a bellwether opening session entitled "The 
Bishop as Teacher of the Faith," with prepared remarks by Curia Cardinal Joseph 
A. Ratzinger and New York's Cardinal John J. O'Connor. No Vatican account of 
the session will appear before this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere was very good. There were no criticisms; it was not an 'us and 
them' kind of thing," an American participant told The Times on Wednesday night 
after the first session ended. He asked not to be identified directly. 
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, delivered in Italian, Ratzinger -- who is known around the 
Vatican as the "deputy Pope" -- stressed a bishop's responsibility to 
evangelize even when his message is not popular or his audience anxious to 
listen, the American said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, for his part, spoke of the difficulties of evangelization in a 
secular culture, particularly one as wed to change and mobility as the United 
States. The United States, he told the Pope, is a country where people expect 
to have a voice in the affairs of their institutions, including their churches. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen American bishops, but none from the Curia, took part in a discussion 
that followed, the participant said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pope listened intently. He probably will not speak again himself until the 
end of the meeting," the American said. 
</P>
<P>
The conference aims to reduce tensions between an independent-minded American 
church and a traditionalist Vatican headed by a strong, obedience-demanding 
Pope. Many American practices, ranging from accepting homosexuals as practicing 
Catholics to group absolution of sins and a tacit acceptance of artificial 
birth control, irritate Vatican conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Reality Is Distant' 
</P>
<P>
"There is almost bound to be the frustration of mutual incomprehension. For a 
Polish Pope and the largely Italian Curial staff, the American reality is 
distant. We, in turn, have as much difficulty understanding other peoples as 
they have understanding us," said Father Terry Tekippe, a New Orleans professor 
of theology who is spending a year in Rome as a visiting scholar. 
</P>
<P>
The two addresses by American delegates made public Wednesday stressed the open 
nature of the secular democratic society in which Catholicism has found root in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"There is total freedom of thought in public educational and cultural media, 
and any form of censorship is abhorred," Archbishop May told the Pope in his 
opening address. He continued: "Authoritarianism is suspect in any area of 
learning or culture. Individual freedom is prized supremely. Religious doctrine 
and moral teaching are widely judged by these criteria. 
</P>
<P>
"To assert that there is a church teaching with authority, binding and loosing 
for eternity, is truly a sign of contradiction to many Americans who consider 
the divine right of bishops as outmoded as the divine right of kings," said 
May. His phrasing is from the Gospel of St. Matthew (16:19) in which Jesus, 
establishing his church, tells St. Peter: "Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth 
shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be 
loosed in heaven." 
</P>
<P>
May stressed the size and vigor of the 53-million member American church and 
the diversity of the nation in which it labors. American bishops have long 
sought to persuade the Vatican that Catholic evangelization in the United 
States must take into account the country's particular cultural context. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican, with a more global view, has proved unyielding. Said a Vatican 
loyalist after reading the opening speeches: "In the context of the universal 
church, the Americans are a small cultural minority. That kind of talk will not 
get a sympathetic hearing here." " 
</P>
<P>
In his address, Bernardin stressed the openness in which the American church 
operates. "We proclaim the Gospel in a communications-oriented society in a 
world that has become ever smaller. Because of the freedom of speech and the 
freedom of press inherent in our society, and because of the importance 
accorded to the church within the U.S. by our fellow Americans, discussions 
that at one time might have been considered intramural have significant 
repercussions throughout the world." 
</P>

<P>
AMERICANS AT THE VATICAN: THE ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican meeting between American bishops and Pope John Paul II is intended 
to define the proper role of bishops. Among the specific issues likely to 
arise: 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican's rejection of artificial birth control. The Pope will likely 
insist that the bishops demonstrate greater adherence to a policy disregarded 
by most American Catholics, including many priests. 
</P>
<P>
The role of the increasingly outspoken National Bishop's Conference. The Pope 
believes that the bishops should deal individually with Rome. 
</P>
<P>
In some American archdioceses, the use of group absolution and the acceptance 
of homosexuals as practicing Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
The influence of American theologians who, John Paul believes, have too freely 
interpreted church dogma. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that some individual priests and parishes are allowed to set their own 
rules on such practices as how the sacraments are administered. 
</P>
<P>
The annulments of marriages gone bad, on which the Vatican considers the 
American church's standards too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
The growing pressure for lay preachers and a greater role for women in the 
American church. 
</P>

IF TOWER IS SPURNED; 
</P>
<P>
NEXT NOMINEE: MATTER OF HOW AS WELL AS WHO

<P>
Beneath the Bush Administration's determination to stick with defense 
secretary-designate John Tower to the end, there is a lively but 
still-unofficial debate over who will be next if Tower goes down in defeat on 
the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
At issue, said sources close to the Administration, is not only who the best 
candidate is to lead the Pentagon into an era of belt-tightening and reform, 
but how the President should respond to the Senate in the wake of a repudiation 
of Tower, his first choice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Directions 
</P>
<P>
Should Bush's next pick be someone designed to please the very lawmakers who 
are bent on dealing his Administration a harsh political blow in its infancy? 
Or should the President use the opportunity to show Congress who's boss? 
</P>
<P>
The debate has split Republican strategists, and White House insiders suggest 
the rift is reflected among Bush's inner circle of advisers. 
</P>
<P>
The range of candidates whose names are now circulating is broad. 
</P>
<P>
There is a trio of former defense secretaries -- Republicans Donald H. Rumsfeld 
and James R. Schlesinger and Democrat Harold Brown. 
</P>
<P>
There is another former lawmaker -- Jack Edwards, the Alabama Republican who 
voluntarily gave up a congressional seat and recently co-chaired a commission 
recommending the closing of obsolete military bases. And there is a pair of 
retired military officers already in the Administration -- Adm. James D. 
Watkins, Bush's energy secretary, and Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, the President's 
national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the White House has brooked no public discussion from its ranks about 
possible replacements, wary of undercutting the already hard-pressed lobbying 
effort to keep Tower's chances alive. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether any list of candidates exists, one Bush Administration official 
said flatly: "None. Zero. None." 
</P>
<P>
But another Administration official familiar with the process said: "It's 
absolutely foolish not to be considering alternatives and considering people 
for these priority positions . . . I'm sure it's being discussed in little 
pockets." 
</P>
<P>
Melvin R. Laird, a former Richard M. Nixon Administration defense secretary who 
has advised Bush on transition matters, acknowledged that "advice to the 
President has been divided" over how long to stick with Tower and to whom to 
switch if the expected Senate rejection comes this week or next. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say there is some support for Bush making his next move a defiant one, 
reasserting his primacy over national security issues with a Tower-Scowcroft 
switch. 
</P>
<P>
Under that scenario, Scowcroft would slide over to the top Pentagon post and 
Tower would become national security adviser, a job that does not require 
Senate confirmation. That would allow Bush to keep Tower in a key policy post 
despite the Democrats' snub and at the same time not risk a confirmation 
backlash against Scowcroft, who is widely respected by both parties. 
</P>
<P>
Two Republican strategists said the idea has been discussed within the 
Administration, but acknowledged there is disagreement on its wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
Such a stroke is "the only thing you could do to save political face" after an 
embarrassing, personal defeat, said one Administration official, adding: "What 
do you do when this guy, your friend, is getting clobbered?" 
</P>
<P>
Bush, while refusing to discuss any second choices, has fed the speculation 
about such a counterpunch nomination with his angry rhetoric on Tower. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush 'Wants' Tower 
</P>
<P>
There is "the right of the President to have -- historical right -- to have who 
he wants in his Administration," Bush said in his press conference Tuesday. "I 
want him." And he could have Tower -- as national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
But other prominent Republicans said they fear such a ploy would only infuriate 
Democrats and provoke them to paralyze future Administration legislative 
efforts that will require bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
Should Bush choose instead to appease his congressional opponents in an effort 
to restore bipartisan cooperation, other options might be more likely. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the center of the Democratic effort to defeat Tower, 
said last week that there are "all sorts of people" who have strong national 
security credentials, and no heavy burden of allegations, who would pass 
muster. 
</P>
<P>
Making the same point, Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) cited Rumsfeld and 
Schlesinger as prime choices, adding: "If the President sends another name up 
here, it'll be confirmed by a heavy majority." 
</P>
<P>
Such a choice by the President might fall short of a strong statement, however, 
and within Bush's circle of advisers those particular men have some problems. 
In January, Schlesinger's reputation as an acerbic intellectual with 
questionable political loyalties helped cost him the job of energy secretary in 
the Bush Cabinet. Schlesinger had served as defense secretary in the Nixon and 
Gerald R. Ford administrations and as energy secretary for Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Rumsfeld, while a Bush adviser in the final phases of the 1988 campaign, began 
the race in the camp of Bush's chief rival, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), a fact that 
Laird said has weighed against him. Moreover, sources say that Bush's relations 
with Rumsfeld, who is now a Chicago-based investment banking adviser, remain 
strained from bureaucratic battles waged when Bush was CIA director and 
Rumsfeld secretary of defense during the Ford Administration. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Laird said he thinks President Carter's defense secretary, Harold 
Brown, would be a good choice. "Brown is a very strong national security 
advocate who understands the Pentagon very well. He's not a partisan person 
when it comes to defense." 
</P>
<P>
A number of other names have surfaced from the ranks of politics and industry. 
</P>
<P>
Donald B. Rice, president of the Santa Monica-based RAND Corp., would be 
unlikely to face a challenge from Nunn, the leader among Democrats in defense 
issues. Rice has been an informal adviser to Nunn as well as a golfing partner. 
</P>
<P>
Drew Lewis, whose name was floated for the top Pentagon job before Tower was 
named, is a favorite candidate among those who seek a tough budget-cutter and a 
hands-on manager with business experience. Lewis, a former Ronald Reagan 
Administration transportation secretary, is chief executive officer of the 
Union Pacific Corp. and served recently on the congressionally created National 
Economic Commission that explored methods of reducing the federal budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Requires Law Waiver 
</P>
<P>
Watkins, a retired high-ranking Navy officer held in high regard by both 
parties, might be a popular choice for rebuilding a bipartisan spirit. However, 
his choice would require Congress to waive a 1947 law that prohibits retired 
military officers from serving in the senior defense position within 10 years 
of leaving the service. Scowcroft would not face that problem, having left the 
Air Force more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Like Tower, Jack Edwards would bring a knowledge of Congress and an expertise 
in the fine print of the defense budget to the Pentagon's top job. But critics 
say that unlike Tower, Edwards is no grand policy strategist, an important 
trait for that job. 
</P>
<P>
Republican strategists predict that Bush will stick to his Tower pattern by 
choosing someone with broad policy vision who would complement his nominee for 
Pentagon's second-in-charge, Donald J. Atwood, a former General Motors 
executive with strong management expertise. 
</P>
<P>
That might rule out previous runners-up like Martin-Marietta chief executive 
Norman R. Augustine and Alcoa chairman Paul H. O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
But it would allow Bush options for either a defiant gesture or a conciliatory 
one, whichever way Bush decides to play the next round in the Pentagon 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, said one GOP source, Senate Democrats may "rue the day" they 
thought they won the Tower battle.

ECHOES OF THE '60S; 
</P>
<P>
BLACK YOUTH: ASSERTIVE NEW PRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
When more than 1,000 black students at Howard University stormed the main 
administration building earlier this week to force the resignation of 
Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater from the school's Board of 
Trustees, their intensity, resolve and sense of purpose seemed more reminiscent 
of the '60s than the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
That shouldn't have come as any surprise, say some educators, sociologists and 
young blacks themselves, who believe that what happened at Howard is just one 
example of a larger swing -- still as much stylistic as political -- 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of news headlines about gangs and drugs, high black youth 
unemployment and soaring teen-age pregnancy, these observers detect a rising 
movement among blacks between ages 16 and 23 toward black pride, black 
awareness and black assertiveness. It is evident in their dress, their music, 
their conversation and their attitude. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rap Music Lyrics Change 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Jim Patterson, program director for popular black-oriented 
radio station KDAY, saw its emergence more than a year ago when the lyrics of 
rap music rolling into his office began to change from girls and gold chains to 
resisting racism. And he noticed that the lyrics began to feature quotations 
from Malcolm X, Louis Farrakhan and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, activist rap artists like Public Enemy, Stetsasonic, Ice T and BDP 
were selling hundreds of thousands of records, and black youngsters were 
listening to albums and song titles like "It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold 
Us Back," "Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos," "Freedom or Death" and 
"A.F.R.I.C.A." 
</P>
<P>
In New York several months ago, music critic and author Nelson George began to 
notice black youngsters wearing leather medallions of Africa in red, black and 
green "liberation colors" and African inspired fashion -- items he hadn't seen 
in nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interest in Malcolm X 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Thorpe, manager of a B. Dalton bookstore just outside Atlanta, sensed it 
when she began being bombarded with requests for books on black history and 
black culture, particularly from black youngsters interested in Malcolm X. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile at Central High School in Philadelphia, University and Fairfax high 
schools in Los Angeles and numerous other institutions across the country, 
college counselors suddenly began to get requests for applications to black 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Observers say one reason for an upsurge in black activism is that today's youth 
are the children of the activists of the late '60s and early '70s. One of the 
leaders of the Howard uprising, for instance, was Raz Baraka, son of Imamu 
Amiri Baraka, the foremost author during that earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the rap group Public Enemy said their political philosophy was first 
formed during two years in a neighborhood summer school program run by members 
of the Nation of Islam and the Black Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
Those close to it say that the heightened black consciousness also is related 
to a number of other factors, including last year's presidential campaign by 
Jackson and increased study of black history and culture surrounding the Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Positive Film and TV Images 
</P>
<P>
In part, they say, it is the result of the positive images presented in some 
film and television programs, for example, "The Cosby Show" and "A Different 
World," the television documentary series "Eyes on the Prize" and the movie 
"School Daze." 
</P>
<P>
But many, and particularly young blacks themselves, believe that the main 
underpinning is a desperate attempt at mere survival by the group that is the 
most "at risk" in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly three of every four black children live in poverty, more than half in 
single-parent homes. Murder is the No. 1 cause of death among black males under 
25. Black teen-age unemployment and high school dropout rates are soaring while 
the number of blacks attending college is declining. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, black youngsters said that as they look around and see their job 
and educational opportunities diminishing, their family structure deteriorating 
and their communities under siege by drugs and gangs, they are left with the 
chore of trying to heal themselves because society does not seem to have a 
place for them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Have to Achieve' 
</P>
<P>
"It's our generation realizing that we have to achieve and we can't do it by 
ourselves, and the adults haven't made a place for us," said Keith Ross, 17, of 
Philadelphia. "So we have to come together. It's our time." 
</P>
<P>
"The young people have turned to each other as a collective way of 
understanding what's going on and saying that they have to fight back," added 
New York psychologist Lenora Fulani. "They're saying, I'd better take my life 
in my hands because these people are doing a terrible job with it." 
</P>
<P>
No one is sure exactly what the extent of the movement is. 
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, you've got this expression of pride in our cultural 
heritage," said Dr. Velma Lapointe, assistant dean of human ecology at Howard 
University and co-author of "Black Children and American Institutions." "But at 
the same time, we've got the problems of high rates of juvenile delinquency, 
low rates of black men going to college, high rates of homicide, teen-age 
pregnancy to the point that it makes you question the relationship between the 
negative things that are going on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Future Impact Unclear 
</P>
<P>
Nor can many predict what it will mean in years to come. "I think we're right 
on the verge of it," said Molefi Asanti, director of African-American studies 
at Temple University in Philadlephia. "I think the fullness of this will come 
in two years." 
</P>
<P>
Some observers point to the demonstration at Howard as an example of what's 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, similar student protests have been mounted at nearly 50 
other colleges and universities -- the University of Michigan, University of 
Massachusetts, Wesleyan, The Citadel, Northern Illinois University, Cornell 
University, Columbia University and others. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, it was black students at Jefferson and Washington high schools 
who initiated student protests over contract negotiations between the school 
board and teachers, and at Fairfax High black students held a sit-in last year 
when the school dropped its black studies program. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Allen, a sociology professor and associate director of African-American 
studies at the University of Michigan, points to the recent riots in Miami and 
Tampa, Fla., as a more ominous indicator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'On Verge of Boiling Over' 
</P>
<P>
"What we have is a kettle that is on the verge of boiling over, an explosion 
that is waiting to happen," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
While many see Allen's assessment as too apocalyptic, they do agree on one 
thing: This time the upsurge in black pride and involvement has taken on a 
tougher, harder edge, rooted in the more assertive aspects of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
They note that while black youth have been bombarded through school and the 
media with the legacy of Martin Luther King, it is a figure almost never 
mentioned there who has captured many of their imaginations -- Malcolm X, a 
firebrand of the '60s whose philosophies of black nationalism and African 
identification have lit a fire in the minds of many black youth. 
</P>
<P>
Thorpe, whose Decatur bookstore is frequented by black students from three 
nearby high schools, said the slain black activist is so popular that she 
sometimes hears students discussing him in the corridors of the nearby shopping 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
"His books are like cornerstones," she said. "Once the kids get a taste of 
Malcolm X, they want everything they can get their hands on. I have two whole 
shelves devoted to him. I don't think I've got that much space devoted to 
Martin Luther King. . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keeps Copies Handy 
</P>
<P>
"I tend to keep 50 copies (of Malcolm X's autobiography) in the store at all 
times simply so I don't have to order 20 a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a couple of people say that Martin Luther King can only carry you so 
far. I think Malcolm X fills that need." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Lindsey, a Baltimore art salesman, said he has seen the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never sold a Martin Luther King poster to a college student," said 
Lindsey, who, hawking a series of black art outside a Howard University 
ceremony in honor of King, had already run out of one particular Malcolm X 
drawing. "It's always Malcolm X." 
</P>
<P>
Una Mulzac, owner of Liberation Bookstore in Harlem and Dawud Hakim, who owns 
bookstores in Atlanta and Philadelphia, said Malcolm X is by far the most 
popular figure among black youth. They report that high school students are 
gobbling up tapes of his speeches, duplicating them and handing them out to 
their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
Mulzac recalls an 18-year-old who wandered into her store recently and wanted 
to know if he really looked like Malcolm X, as his uncle had suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"He was thrilled when I told him he did," she said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Malcolm X, there is interest in the more radical elements of the 
black struggle, the Black Panthers and the Nation of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real response to the more controversial leaders," said Fulani, who 
speaks to thousands of black students on college campuses. "They're not 
anti-Farrakhan, for instance. They have a gut feeling for (such leaders) in a 
way that they don't have for mainstream politicians." 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying the interest is a hunger for slogans and articles associated with 
a more politically assertive philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Around black colleges, sweat shirts and T-shirts touting black pride are in hot 
demand. Vendor Jasper Hill, set up just off Howard University's campus, said 
that by far his most in-demand item is a sweat shirt that reads "Black By 
Popular Demand," a slogan coined by a college student at Fisk University in 
Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Items 
</P>
<P>
Leather pendants of "Mother Africa" have become increasingly popular, along 
with African-inspired clothing, Kinte cloth caps and scarfs. Natural hair 
styles, the vogue of the '60s and '70s, are rapidly replacing the greasy, 
processed "Jherri curl" look of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond fashion statements, bookstores report dramatically increased interest in 
books on African-American and African culture and history. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real movement," said Thorpe in Decatur. "In the last couple of years 
it has really escalated. There's a real hunger for it." 
</P>
<P>
So great is the demand, Thorpe said, that she set aside a separate black 
section, which takes up about one-third of her store. Impressed by her sales 
figures, B. Dalton headquarters sent a memo to its 700 stores to see if similar 
requests were occurring across the country, and suggested that if so, other 
stores might want to follow suit. One hundred stores have, B. Dalton officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Counselors See Trend 
</P>
<P>
At high schools, particularly at schools where blacks are a minority, college 
counselors said black students are expressing a strong, new interest in 
attending black colleges. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago, I would seldom have a black student ask me a question about a 
black college," said Don Olson, college counselor at University High School in 
Los Angeles. "Now, virtually all of my counselees who are black have asked me 
about them."

"There's a lot more interest," said Mickey Braiman, college counselor at 
Fairfax High School in Los Angeles. "In the past, some kids felt that they 
would only be able to survive if they went to a black school. Now the attitude 
is that 'I can survive at any school, but I'm looking out and selecting a black 
school.' Now kids feel, 'I have my own . . . ' It's a positive choice." 
</P>
<P>
Many black colleges report dramatic increases in enrollment and interest. 
Spelman College in Atlanta reported that inquiries doubled last year and 
freshman enrollment jumped by one-third. Nearby, Morehouse College was so 
swamped with students this year that some were being housed at a Days Inn 
motel. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of that is because black parents who have actively sought integrated 
elementary, junior and high schools for their children have become disenchanted 
with the results, high school and college counselors report. 
</P>
<P>
That was the attitude of Tracy Lewis' parents. After 18 years of footing the 
bill at prestigious, mostly white private schools in and around Gary, Ind., 
they packed her off to Spelman against her will. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to come, but my dad told me that it was time for me to be around 
black people," said Lewis, 21. "I felt that things that are black aren't good. 
I thought black schools, because they were black, were inferior. Now, my 
attitude towards my blackness has changed 180 degrees. It was like somebody 
socked me in the head and said, 'Where have you been.' When I came to Spelman, 
it was the greatest feeling of relief. It was so cool being around other black 
women. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody had told me that in 1987 I would have been in Forsyth County (Ga.) 
marching against the Ku Klux Klan, I would have said 'You're crazy.' But there 
I was." 
</P>
<P>
Other black students, like Keith Lee, a senior at prestigious and integrated 
Central High School in Philadelphia, report similar awakenings. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always hanging out with a lot of white students, and because I'm 
light-skinned, everybody was always asking me if I was Puerto Rican or some 
other culture," he said. "I didn't know anything about my heritage. Now . . . I 
find myself anxious to go to the library to read about black literature and 
black history." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, students at largely white universities have flooded the 
African-American studies departments, colleges and universities report. At the 
University of Michigan, the numbers have jumped from 250 students to 1,600 
students in the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
Although most share Malcolm X's street-tough philosophy of "By Any Means 
Necessary," popularized recently by a rap album of that name, those 
interviewed, adults and youth, were quick to say that they have not adopted a 
"hate whitey" stance associated with black militants of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't call the attitude militant," said Darren White, 27, of Jersey City, 
N.J., as he browsed through the stacks at Liberation Bookstore in Harlem. 
"Let's say aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
Patterson of KDAY in Los Angeles said he has seen that attitude in the focus 
interview groups conducted by the station with local youth. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more vocalizing in terms of getting their just reward . . . " he said. 
"The prevailing mood is: 'We have the ability to get it done. We're gonna do 
what it takes to get it done.' . . .They realize that they have to do it 
because the other systems have let them down." 
</P>
<P>
Black youths are talking to each other through rap music. It has become what 
one rap artist fondly calls "black youths' television," the pipeline of 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, Public Enemy and all of those rap groups are speaking to a concern 
and a felt need among those kids," said Allen at the University of Michigan. 
"It's a concern and need that speaks to some of the difficulties confronting 
society, sort of a crying out and a demand, if you will, for change."

PUBLIC LAND SALES A STEAL UNDER OLD LAW, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An antiquated federal law designed to encourage mining in sparsely populated 
parts of the West instead is permitting developers to buy vast federal tracts 
for less than one one-thousandth of their fair market value, the General 
Accounting Office reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs taking advantage of the law paid the government less than $4,000 
for land estimated to be worth up to $48 million, GAO auditors revealed in a 
survey of just 20 of the hundreds of such sales concluded since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
A random sample by the agency of 285 applications still pending before the 
Interior Department found that in 12 cases alone, the government is preparing 
to sell land worth up to $47 million for just $16,000, according to the report, 
unveiled before the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The mining law, enacted by Congress in 1872, permitted U.S. citizens to buy 
patents for most mineral deposits on federal lands for $2.50 an acre, with 
others priced at $5 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
While the scope of the law recently has been narrowed, it still sets the same 
low prices for public lands on which buyers can demonstrate that gold, silver 
and other hard rock minerals can be viably mined. 
</P>
<P>
But the GAO study found that little of the land is actually used for mining and 
suggested that many tracts -- located near profitable ski resorts and casinos 
-- had been bought for speculation. The report urged that the law immediately 
be amended to prohibit such land sales. 
</P>
<P>
"This is outrageous," Rep. Nick J. Rahall II (D-W. Va.) declared, endorsing the 
recommendation. "At $2.50 an acre, these valuable federal lands are being 
transferred out of public ownership for fast-food hamburger prices." 
</P>
<P>
The mining law presents the most significant exception in U.S. law to a general 
rule requiring public lands be sold at fair market value. It originally was 
enacted to promote settlement in the West and the exploration and development 
of domestic mineral resources. 
</P>
<P>
The new disclosures about the cost of the law to the federal government add to 
concerns raised in 1986, when speculators bought 17,000 federal acres for 
$42,500, then weeks later sold them to major oil companies for $37 million. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of the public outcry that resulted, the Ronald Reagan 
Administration imposed a moratorium on such sales for lands containing oil 
shale. But little consideration was given to potential problems raised by sales 
of land yielding hard rock minerals; such sales never were proscribed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the deadline for the Reagan moratorium has expired, leaving hundreds 
of land-purchase applications again pending for Interior consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Confronted with the evidence in an appearance before the committee, Interior 
Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. testified that his department now has "no way of 
dealing" with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
But he told the committee he had "a lot of sympathy with what the GAO is 
saying," and he told reporters later that "maybe it is time to revisit" the 
1872 law. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not satisfied with $2.50 an acre," he said. "We have to look at 
alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
Under provisions of the mining law, the federal government in the last 117 
years has sold about 3.2 million federal acres -- an area about the size of 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
In its current form, the law allows citizens to prospect for minerals on most 
federal lands, and, if a valuable deposit is discovered, to buy for a nominal 
fee a patent giving rights to both the minerals and the land. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the GAO, an investigative agency of Congress, said the potential 
for the law's abuse has been raised by "escalating land prices near expanding 
communities, resort areas and tourist attractions." Under those conditions, it 
said, the patent provision has become "an attractive means of acquiring title 
to valuable land for non-mining purposes," and has resulted in "patent holders 
reaping huge profits at the government's expense." 
</P>
<P>
The report said, for example, that a 160-acre claim near the Keystone ski 
resort in Colorado was patented in 1983 for $400. Last year, 44 acres of the 
claim were offered for sale for $484,000 as part of a real estate development. 
No mining ever took place. 
</P>
<P>
In another case pending before Interior, investors in 1987 filed a claim for 
1,280 acres adjacent to Lake Mead National Recreation Area and within three 
miles of nine gambling casinos in Laughlin, Nev. The GAO report said that if 
that claim were approved, the government would receive $3,200 for land valued 
at between $25.6 million and $35 million. 
</P>
<P>
Warning that the "gap is growing" between nominal prices set by the mining law 
and the federal land's true value, the GAO estimated the government stands to 
lose "tens of millions of dollars" if the mining law is not amended. The agency 
recommended the government maintain ownership of the lands and lease them to 
those who would mine them. 
</P>
<P>
That recommendation was strongly endorsed by Dave Albersworth, a spokesman for 
the National Wildlife Federation, who noted: "This law is a sacred cow, and 
feeds a Western mythic mentality that believes Gabby Hayes can still go out 
with a burro and pickax and find a mother lode." 
</P>
<P>
But Keith Knoblock, a vice president of the American Mining Congress, said in 
an interview that the trade group would oppose efforts to amend the 
legislation.

MUSEUM POSTS QUIT BY NORTON SIMON; WIFE SUCCEEDS HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Retired industrialist Norton Simon has resigned as president of the Norton 
Simon Museum and was succeeded by his wife, actress Jennifer Jones Simon, 
museum officials announced late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 82-year-old Simon also resigned as a member and trustee of the museum. The 
resignations were effective last Friday, a written statement released by the 
Pasadena museum said. 
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that Simon had been recently admitted to UCLA Medical 
Center and was "presently hospitalized for undisclosed medical reasons." 
However, Rich Elbaum, a medical center spokesman, said Wednesday night that 
Simon was not currently a patient there. 
</P>
<P>
"He is definitely not an in-patient at this time," Elbaum said, adding that he 
could not determine if Simon had been admitted to the hospital recently. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the museum said that Simon is very ill and confined to a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Jones Simon, who won an Academy Award for best actress for her 
performance in the 1943 film "Song of Bernadette," was elected to replace her 
husband as president and will lead the museum's board of trustees as chairman, 
president and chief executive officer, the museum statement said. 
</P>
<P>
No representative of the museum could be reached for comment late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Simon's art collection, one of the most coveted in the world, has an estimated 
value in excess of $750 million. It includes many works by old masters, such as 
Raphael and Rembrandt, and a large number of works by modern masters. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, Simon abandoned a widely publicized offer to donate the collection 
to UCLA. There have been no further announcements about the future of the art 
works, which presently are on long-term loan to the Pasadena museum. 
</P>
<P>
Simon has claimed for years that his wealth is not sufficient to finance the 
museum in perpetuity and so will be forced to make arrangements to house the 
collection at another institution. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Portland, Ore., Simon made his fortune in the 1920s and '30s in the 
vegetable packing and canning industries. By the 1970s, he had built a 
corporate conglomerate worth more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The museum also announced Wednesday the addition of two trustees: Simon's 
granddaughter, Pamela Simon, who is currently studying film making at the UCLA 
Graduate School of Motion Picture and Television, and Professor Seymour Slive 
of Harvard, formerly of Pomona College.

NEWER TECHNIQUE FOR DETECTION OF BIRTH DEFECTS CALLED SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recently developed technique for early prenatal detection of birth defects is 
generally "safe and effective," but is slightly riskier and more prone to 
failure than amniocentesis, a more widely used technique usually performed 
later in pregnancy, according to a new study being published today. 
</P>
<P>
The federally sponsored study of about 3,000 women aged 33 years or more found 
that the increased risk of fetal loss associated with the newer technique, 
chorionic villus sampling, was 0.8% higher than that associated with 
amniocentesis. An accurate diagnosis of fetal chromosomal abnormalities such as 
Down's syndrome was obtained 97.8% of the time, compared to 99.4% of the time 
with amniocentesis. 
</P>
<P>
Chorionic villus sampling, or CVS, is "here to stay" but "it will not replace 
amniocentesis," said Dr. Lawrence D. Platt of County-USC Medical Center, an 
expert practitioner of the two techniques who was not involved in the new 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Chorionic villus sampling is performed during the third month of pregnancy. The 
tissue for laboratory analysis is obtained from the placenta, the connection 
between the fetus and the mother, which contains cells that are almost always 
genetically identical to those of the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
Amniocentesis is usually performed between the 15th and 20th weeks of 
pregnancy, although some obstetricians are doing the procedure earlier. In this 
technique, fetal cells and fetal proteins from the amniotic fluid, the liquid 
that surrounds the fetus, are analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
Platt said chorionic villus sampling "clearly carries the advantages of earlier 
prenatal diagnosis," such as reduced patient anxiety and decreased risk to the 
mother when a birth defect is detected and an abortion carried out. 
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that chorionic villus sampling also suffered from some of the 
"inherent limitations" of earlier diagnosis, such as a small increased risk of 
miscarriages, an increased number of uncertain diagnoses that require further 
testing and an inability to detect problems that do not manifest themselves 
until later in pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Another drawback is the inability of chorionic villus sampling to detect neural 
tube birth defects, such as anencephaly and spina bifida. In addition, some 
parents may elect to terminate pregnancies for non-medical reasons, such as sex 
selection. Such terminations are rare when the sex of the baby is not learned 
until later in pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
There were 25 elective abortions of "chromosomally normal" fetuses in the 
chorionic villus group, including about 15 for sex selection, compared to two 
such elective abortions in the amniocentesis group, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
Many within and outside the medical community object strongly to parents 
aborting a pregnancy because a fetus is not of the desired sex. Some medical 
centers have policies against performing prenatal diagnostic techniques for sex 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
Results similar to those in the new U.S. study were found in a Canadian study 
of 2,787 women that was published in the Lancet, a British medical journal, in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian study had the advantage of randomly comparing the two procedures, 
while the American study did not; according to the new report, the primarily 
well-educated private patients who were studied at UC San Francisco and six 
other major medical centers resisted a "vigorous effort" to randomly assign 
them. Instead, they were given a choice between the techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Platt and another expert in maternal-fetal medicine said the data from both 
studies underscored the need for women to seek medical care early in pregnancy 
and to discuss with their physicians the pros and cons of the increasingly 
complicated array of prenatal diagnostic tests. 
</P>
<P>
They also predicted that publication of the study would accelerate a trend 
toward wider availability of chorionic villus sampling. 
</P>
<P>
Chorionic villus sampling "is a viable alternative to amniocentesis in the 
hands of experienced people," said Dr. John Williams III, the medical director 
of the Prenatal Diagnostic Center of Southern California, a private facility in 
Beverly Hills. Williams, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at 
UCLA, said he performs 15 to 20 procedures a week at his center, which along 
with UC San Francisco is one of the busiest CVS facilities on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
L.A. Performance Rate 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years, about 1,500 of these procedures have been performed in 
Los Angeles, compared to more than 22,000 amniocenteses, Platt said. An 
estimated 50,000 to 60,000 of the procedures have been performed worldwide, 
according to Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Some insurers, such as Kaiser-Permanente of Southern California and Blue Cross 
of California have covered chorionic villus sampling since late last year. 
Others, such as Blue Shield of California and Medi-Cal, the 
government-supported insurance program for the poor, do not cover the procedure 
because they consider it experimental. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, physicians offering the procedure must receive specific approval 
from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration because the catheters, or thin 
sterile tubes, through which the sampling is performed are considered 
experimental and none is approved for marketing. About 30 physicians nationwide 
are estimated to have such authorization. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the status of the catheters, a knowledgeable FDA official said 
that they are likely to remain under investigation for some time. To date none 
of the companies that manufacture them have requested marketing approval and 
submitted the necessary data for review, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Chorionic villus sampling was developed in the early 1980s. During the 
procedure, the catheter is inserted into the uterus through the vagina under 
the guidance of an ultrasound machine. A small amount of placental tissue is 
then removed through the tube. The procedure can also be performed by inserting 
a needle into the uterus through the abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of the sampling are available within a day and final 
results -- which require culturing cells in a laboratory -- within one to two 
weeks. The total cost in Los Angeles is about $1,300 to $1,400, Platt said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Level of Discomfort 
</P>
<P>
During amniocentesis, a needle is inserted into the amniotic fluid through the 
abdomen, also under ultrasound guidance. Because the fetal cells must be grown 
extensively in a laboratory, complete test results are usually not available 
for several weeks. The total cost in Los Angeles ranges from $800 to $1,100, 
Platt said. 
</P>
<P>
Both procedures take 10 to 30 minutes to perform. According to Platt, the level 
of patient discomfort is similar, although he said the majority of patients 
seem to find chorionic villus sampling less painful. 
</P>
<P>
Both techniques are most frequently used to screen for Down's syndrome and 
other chromosomal abnormalities, which are most common in mothers aged 35 or 
older. As part of the chromosome analysis, the sex of the baby can be 
determined as well. The techniques can also be used to screen for inherited 
genetic diseases, such as Tay-Sachs disease, cystic fibrosis, muscular 
dystrophy and sickle cell anemia. 
</P>
<P>
The new study was sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Results in 2,278 women who had chorionic villus sampling were compared to those 
in 671 women who had amniocentesis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rate of Losses 
</P>
<P>
The total rate of pregnancy losses, including spontaneous abortions, 
termination of abnormal pregnancies, stillbirths and neonatal deaths, was 7.2% 
in the group that underwent chorionic villus sampling and 5.7% in the group 
that had amniocentesis. The highest rate of pregnancy loss followed chorionic 
villus procedures in which multiple attempts to obtain placental tissue were 
required. 
</P>
<P>
After adjustment for differences in the ages of the mothers and the fetuses -- 
which influence the expected rate of fetal loss -- the researchers said the 
"total loss rate" for women in the chorionic villus group exceeded the rate for 
the amniocentesis group by 0.8%. 
</P>
<P>
The most common symptoms after the procedures were cramping and spotting; these 
were more common in the chorionic villus group. None of the pregnant women 
suffered serious infections, although such infections are known to be a rare 
complication of chorionic villus sampling.

GUN BAN CLEARS ASSEMBLY PANEL BUT LACKS VOTES FOR FLOOR VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
The Assembly version of a bill to ban military assault weapons in California 
easily cleared a committee obstacle Wednesday, but its author conceded that he 
lacks the votes to win passage by the full Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, sponsored by law enforcement officers statewide and fiercely 
opposed by the National Rifle Assn., is scheduled for an Assembly floor vote 
Monday. It requires a simple majority of 41 votes. 
</P>
<P>
"I have 38 hard votes," Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) said, 
acknowledging that prying loose extra votes from reelection-conscious 
legislators is especially tough on the politically charged gun control issue. 
</P>
<P>
Roos noted that in negotiating for votes, a legislator normally may be asked to 
amend the bill in order to gain support. "But I'm not getting a lot of that. It 
makes me uneasy," Roos said. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly bill was sent to the floor when majority Democratic members of the 
Ways and Means Committee overwhelmed Republicans on a party-line 14-3 vote 
after a sometimes angry hearing. Six Republicans were absent or did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would make it a felony to manufacture, sell, transfer or possess 
without a special permit about 40 semiautomatic military-style guns that would 
be classified as "assault weapons" and include certain pistols, rifles and 
shotguns. It also would be against the law to manufacture, sell or possess 
"look-alike" copies of the banned firearms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eyes on Conference 
</P>
<P>
A similar but broader bill by Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) is 
scheduled for a floor vote today in the Senate, where supporters expressed 
confidence that it will win approval and be sent to the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, it appears that if the Legislature is to outlaw assault weapons 
this year, the final product will be written by a Senate-Assembly conference 
committee, supporters of the Roos and Roberti bills agreed. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, however, the Assembly has shaped up as the major battleground. 
Republicans, who historically oppose gun control, tend to vote as a tighter 
bloc in the Assembly than they do in the Senate. Likewise, conservative 
Assembly Democrats from rural districts, where guns and hunting are part of the 
life style, hesitate to antagonize constituents on firearms issues. 
</P>
<P>
These Democrats, particularly those who won hard-fought reelection battles, are 
especially vulnerable to lobbying by gun-owner groups. In energizing its 
250,000 members in California, the NRA warns that their right to own hunting 
and sporting weapons is in jeopardy, a claim emphatically denied by proponents 
of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
At the Ways and Means Committee hearing, gun owner representatives David 
Marshall of the NRA and Kent L. DeChambeau of the California Rifle &amp; Pistol 
Assn. ran into a firestorm from Democrats when they sought to present their 
case. 
</P>
<P>
DeChambeau called the bill a "simply veiled threat" to outlaw semiautomatic 
hunting rifles, not merely assault weapons. He complained that the bill failed 
to draw a clear distinction between the two. 
</P>
<P>
But one committee member, Assemblyman Elihu Harris (D-Oakland), exploded in 
anger, shouting at DeChambeau and Marshall: "You don't understand the problem 
we are facing. . . . People shooting animals in the wide open spaces is 
different than a Patrick Purdy killing kids in a schoolyard." 
</P>
<P>
The current gun control debate was ignited by the Jan. 17 murders of five 
Stockton children by Purdy, a deranged drifter who raked a schoolyard with at 
least 106 bullets from an AK-47 assault rifle. Twenty-nine other children and a 
teacher were wounded before Purdy killed himself.

SENATE PANEL, DEFYING VETO THREAT, BACKS HIKE IN MINIMUM WAGE TO $4.65 BY 1991

Defying President Bush's veto threat, the Senate Labor Committee voted 11 to 5 
Wednesday for a bill that would raise the $3.35 hourly minimum wage to $4.65 in 
three steps by 1991 without any subminimum rate. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's swift approval, with similar action expected in the House, 
could set the stage this month or early in April for the first legislative 
showdown between the new President and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has proposed a three-stage increase in the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour, 
with an eventual top rate of 90 cents an hour less for new workers in their 
first six months of employment, and he has said he will veto any more generous 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'His Last Offer' 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater reaffirmed Wednesday that 
the President would not yield. "He's giving them our best and last figure up 
front, and his proposal for an increase to $4.25 an hour is fair and firm and 
his last offer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said that the minimum wage has been 
unchanged since 1981 and he believes there is enough congressional support for 
an increase to override a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
"It's on a fast track now," said Kennedy, chairman of the Senate panel and 
chief advocate of the legislation. "The earlier the better, so far as I am 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate may vote as early as next week, he said. The House Education and 
Labor Committee is expected to approve a similar bill next week and seek 
passage by the entire House before the Easter recess starts on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
The federal minimum wage, first enacted a half century ago at the rate of 25 
cents an hour, has been a major battleground for liberals and conservatives in 
almost every decade since. Although former President Ronald Reagan successfully 
opposed any increase in his two terms, Bush announced during his campaign that 
he would favor an increase in the minimum rate but only if it was accompanied 
by a "training wage" for new workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejects Bush Plan 
</P>
<P>
Before approving Kennedy's bill, the Senate Labor Committee rejected Bush's 
plan in a 10-6 vote, mainly along party lines. Two Republicans, Dave 
Durenberger of Minnesota and James M. Jeffords of Vermont, then joined nine 
Democrats in sending the $4.65 legislation to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, led by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), argued that a higher minimum 
wage would destroy 650,000 jobs and contribute to inflation. Their arguments 
were echoed by a business coalition formed to fight any increase in the $3.35 
hourly rate. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition director Bob Martin of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the 
committee-approved bill was "misguided and would have very serious economic 
consequences. We're saying it will set off a Kennedy round of inflation." 
</P>
<P>
But, after the committee vote, Kennedy said the case was "compelling" for an 
increase to $4.65 an hour to restore the 1981 buying power of workers on the 
economic ladder's bottom rung. 
</P>
<P>
As for the President's proposal to pay new workers a lower rate for six months, 
Kennedy said the Labor Department estimated that minimum-wage workers could be 
trained in one month. He said he would listen to proposals for a compromise on 
the amount and duration of a lower wage rate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'Substandard Wage' 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) said Bush's proposal to pay those workers 
80% of the minimum wage rate prevailing for most workers was "just a 
substandard wage for fast-food operators and others like that." 
</P>
<P>
But Hatch termed it a "classic compromise" between those in the Administration 
who oppose any increase and those who want to raise the federal minimum rate on 
equity grounds. The lower rate, Hatch said, would reduce the loss of jobs that 
otherwise might accompany a $4.25 wage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dashed by Filibuster 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's efforts to get Senate approval of a $4.55 hourly minimum wage last 
year were dashed by a GOP-led filibuster at the session's close, despite Bush's 
general support for an unspecified increase. The House never took up similar 
legislation in Congress' last session, partly because Democratic leaders 
decided that they lacked the votes to pass it. 
</P>
<P>
But Kennedy said that proponents were in a stronger position this year, adding: 
"This case is so compelling -- it's a minimum standard of decency. This 
President (Bush) even recommended a 50% increase in pay for members of 
Congress."

3 PLO AIDES GET U.S. VISAS BUT 3 LATIN MAYORS DO NOT

The Bush Administration issued visas Wednesday permitting three Palestine 
Liberation Organization officials to attend weekend meetings at Columbia 
University with Israeli doves, including members of the Knesset or Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the Administration waived a 
15-year-old law banning PLO members from U.S. visits because none of the three 
officials -- Nabil Shath, Afif Safiyah and Noha Nicholas Tadros -- have had 
"personal involvement in terrorist activity." 
</P>
<P>
But the Administration, at the same time, refused to let the mayors of Managua, 
Panama City and Havana attend an international drug abuse conference sponsored 
by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, which began in New York on Wednesday. Redman 
said those visa requests were rejected because Nicaragua, Panama and Cuba have 
not cooperated with U.S.-backed narcotics control programs. 
</P>
<P>
Redman brushed aside complaints of conference organizers that the session's 
purpose was to encourage effective action against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the Columbia University meeting say they hope it will pave the 
way for negotiations between Israel and the PLO, although the session will be 
attended primarily by moderates who have long favored such a dialogue. 
Hard-liners on both sides will not be included. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the Administration issued a visa to Faisal Husseini, director of 
the Arab Study Center in Jerusalem, who was recently released from 18 months of 
administrative detention by Israeli authorities. They had accused him of 
illegal activities on the PLO's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
But Reuters news agency reported from Jerusalem that Israel has refused to 
permit Mustafa Natshe, deposed mayor of the West Bank town of Hebron, to attend 
the symposium. Natshe, removed from office by Israel in 1983 as a result of 
Arab unrest in the Israeli-occupied territory, is closely associated with the 
PLO, although he is not officially a member. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli representatives at the conference include Shulamit Aloni and Yair 
Tsaban, leftist Knesset members. Also included is Yehoshaphat Harkabi, a former 
chief of Israel's military intelligence service. 
</P>
<P>
American participants include Edward W. Said, a Columbia professor who is a 
member of the Palestine National Council, the PLO "parliament in exile," and 
Rita Hauser, an international lawyer who participated in a meeting last year in 
Stockholm between PLO leader Yasser Arafat and prominent American Jews. The 
Stockholm talks led to Arafat's acknowledgement of Israel's right to exist and 
his renunciation of terrorism as a political tactic.

U.S. HOLDS UP $230 MILLION IN AID FOR EGYPT

The United States is holding up $230 million in aid for Egypt because President 
Hosni Mubarak's government has failed to adopt acceptable economic reforms, 
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Redman denied that the aid was contingent on Egypt's agreeing with the 
International Monetary Fund on an economic austerity package. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian sources said, however, that the United States is tying its decision to 
IMF conditions, which they said may be applicable in general but would be 
difficult to implement in Egypt because of the low incomes of many. 
</P>
<P>
The sources noted recent rioting over IMF reforms in Venezuela and Algeria.

NEW ISRAELI STUDY URGES NEGOTIATIONS WITH PLO 
</P>

<P>
Warning that attempts to maintain the status quo in the occupied territories 
could lead to war, a prestigious Israeli think tank called Wednesday on the 
government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to negotiate with the PLO and to 
leave open the option of an eventual Palestinian state in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Outlining what it said was a "realistic path" to peace in the Middle East, the 
Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University endorsed the idea of 
eventual Palestinian sovereignty but said it should be preceded by a 
10-to-15-year period of "confidence building" during which the Palestinians 
would exercise self-rule in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, less notable for its originality than for its attempt to graft 
Arab demands and Israeli concerns into a workable compromise for peace in the 
Middle East, was contained in an annex to an exhaustive, six-month study of 
Israel's options in dealing with the intifada, the 15-month-old Palestinian 
uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Upcoming Shamir Visit 
</P>
<P>
Its release, timed to precede Shamir's visit to Washington next month, also 
coincided with the 15-month anniversary of the intifada, which was marked by 
the start Wednesday of a two-day general strike in the West Bank and the Gaza 
Strip. Only sporadic violence was reported after a day of widespread violence 
Tuesday in which one Palestinian was killed and more than 30 were wounded by 
Israeli troops. 
</P>
<P>
"The uprising impelled us to prepare this report and we felt it imperative to 
complete it before the Israeli government and the new U.S. Administration 
announced their plans for the area," said Joseph Alpher, deputy director of the 
Jaffee Center. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a peace plan but a 10-to-15-year process for progress to peace 
which should be acceptable to 60 to 70% of Israelis . . . and probably lead to 
Palestinian state sovereignty," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The process envisioned by the Jaffee Center academics, who include a number of 
former officials from both the Israeli government and military establishment, 
entails substantial concessions from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Israel, the report said, must halt the building of new Jewish settlements in 
the occupied territories, reconcile itself to the emergence of "some form of a 
Palestinian state" at the end of the process and accept the fact that "no 
settlement of the conflict is possible without direct negotiations with 
authoritative representatives of the Palestinians." In both the current and 
foreseeable future, "only the PLO or, at the very least, Palestinians 
identified with the PLO, meet this criterion," it added. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, Palestinians living in exile must renounce their "right of 
return," giving up all claims to the homes they left behind Israel's pre-1967 
war borders, and agree to enter into a negotiating process that is "open-ended" 
-- that is, a process whose outcome is not subject to preconditions by either 
side. 
</P>
<P>
They must also accept a transitional period of autonomy that is at least twice 
as long as the five-year period envisioned in the decade-old Camp David 
accords, which the Arab world unanimously rejects. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jaffee Center director Aharon Yariv, a retired major general and 
former head of army intelligence, said the Palestinians must accept the fact 
that Israelis will require a long period of "confidence building" before they 
will accept the establishment of a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Israelis would not now accept the possible end-product of the scenario (a 
Palestinian state). But if Palestinians are not prepared to accept a 
10-to-15-year transition period, there won't be any scenario at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel, for its part, "can set conditions on its agreement, but it is going to 
have to talk to the PLO to solve the problem under the present circumstances," 
added Alpher, who headed the 20-member team of Israeli and American academics 
that produced the study. 
</P>
<P>
The report focused on the implications of various scenarios for Israel and 
skirted such questions as the role of an international peace conference favored 
as a negotiating format by the Arab states or the part that the Soviet Union 
should play in the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
However, it indicated that the United States would have to play a central role, 
both in mediating the negotiations and in supporting whatever security 
arrangements Israel required. Substantial Western financial help would also be 
needed, both to offset the economic impact that giving up the territories would 
have in Israel and to help ensure that the fledging Palestinian state could 
survive, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government had no immediate reaction, but several analysts said 
beforehand that they did not expect the report to be well-received by Shamir, 
who steadfastly refuses to negotiate with the PLO or to consider the creation 
of a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir, who has made it clear he will not go much beyond the old Camp David 
autonomy formula, is said to be putting together his own ideas for the peace 
process in a bid to recapture some of the diplomatic momentum seized by the PLO 
late last year when its chairman, Yasser Arafat, publicly renounced terrorism 
and accepted Israel's right to exist. The prime minister's aides have said that 
he will unveil them in Washington next month. 
</P>
<P>
However, the limits that Shamir has placed on a settlement were strongly 
criticized by the Jaffee Center study as designed only to perpetuate a 
dangerous status quo that in the long run will undermine both "the foundations 
of Israel's society and its deterrence (capability) . . . thus raising the 
specter of war." 
</P>
<P>
The report considered and rejected in turn six possible options for dealing 
with the intifada, ranging from autonomy to annexation and forced deportation 
of the 1.7 million Palestinians living in the territories -- an extreme option 
that it said would jeopardize Israel's peace treaty with Egypt, tear apart 
Israeli society from within and make another Arab-Israeli war "inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
Conceding that its recommendations entailed "a mix of risks and opportunities," 
the report said that, while other options might have been preferable for 
Israel, "they are not feasible" any longer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PEACE FOR ISRAEL: A NEW PROPOSAL 
</P>
<P>
Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies evaluated the six 
most commonly discussed options for a political settlement in the 
Israeli-occupied territories and rejected each. In their place, the center 
proposed a fresh approach to peace, starting with the principle that each side 
"must act to accommodate the other's basic needs." Among other things, the 
study said, the Israelis must accept: 
</P>
<P>
That remaining in the territories indefinitely will exact a heavy price and 
constitute a strategic disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
That security can be maintained without physical control over all the 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
That given Israeli security measures, an eventual Palestinian state need not 
constitute a threat, either strategic or terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
That no settlement is possible without direct talks with the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, the study said, the Palestinians must accept: 
</P>
<P>
Recognition of a Jewish state plus renunciation of the Palestinians' "right of 
return." 
</P>
<P>
An open-ended peace process in which Israel offers no commitment as to the 
ultimate settlement. 
</P>
<P>
A transition stage of at least 10 years in which there is no Palestinian state 
and Israeli security measures are tested. 
</P>
<P>
That a final settlement will involve territorial concessions by Israel in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip and permanent security arrangements.

TIBET DISSIDENTS ARE ROUNDED UP; 
</P>
<P>
MARTIAL-LAW CRACKDOWN FOLLOWS PRO-INDEPENDENCE RIOTS

<P>
Suspected pro-independence protesters, some screaming in terror, were rounded 
up by police and soldiers in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa on Wednesday as the 
city began its first day under martial law. 
</P>
<P>
The heavy crackdown, which came after three days of clashes in which police 
shot and killed at least 11 and perhaps 50 or more, appeared to have brought 
relative calm to the city. 
</P>
<P>
All foreigners, with the exception of a handful of people holding teaching or 
business jobs in Lhasa, have been ordered to leave the city by today. Many 
Tibetans fear that once those potential witnesses have been removed, a fierce 
crackdown will take place against those who participated in this week's clashes 
and any who dare to protest in the streets again. 
</P>
<P>
Fear engulfed many of those involved in the protests. Security forces raided 
homes in the city's Tibetan quarter, arresting suspects and taking them away in 
trucks, according to foreign tourists in Lhasa interviewed by telephone from 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
An American tourist described seeing a terrified young Tibetan woman dragged by 
soldiers from the stone-walled courtyard of a residential compound. 
</P>
<P>
"She was screaming and crying and was pulled by many troops into the back of an 
open truck and driven off," he said. "The truck kept coming back and forth. 
Each time they'd arrest someone. They seemed to be doing it pretty 
systematically." 
</P>
<P>
Police had photographed many demonstrators and rioters during the clashes and 
are now in a position to seek out those individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Tibetans "are afraid that . . . whatever people they (police) can identify are 
going to get arrested and maybe executed," another American traveler said. 
"Tibetans think a lot of people are going to get killed, and that's why the 
foreigners (who might inform the outside world) are being forced to leave." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Restraint' Seen as Weakness 
</P>
<P>
Doje Cering, a pro-Chinese ethnic Tibetan who heads the Tibet Autonomous Region 
government, was quoted on China's national radio Wednesday as saying that 
"separatists" advocating Tibetan independence had taken the government's 
"restrained" stance toward previous demonstrations as a sign of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
Three previous pro-independence demonstrations in the past 18 months have been 
suppressed after police opened fire on protesters. Various reports have placed 
the death toll in these incidents anywhere from 15 to 41. After each incident, 
dozens or hundreds of Tibetans were imprisoned, with most released again after 
several weeks or months. Some have been sentenced to long prison terms, and 
Western human rights organizations have reported allegations of torture of 
prisoners by electric cattle prods and other means. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities now say these protests were handled too leniently. 
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time for a radical solution," Doje said, according to the radio 
report. "If we don't adopt that now, it will seriously influence our social 
stability." 
</P>
<P>
The current troubles in Lhasa began Sunday when about a dozen Buddhist monks 
and nuns staged a pro-independence demonstration, which soon escalated into a 
rock-and-bottle-throwing clash with police. Police shootings and widespread 
rioting followed. Official reports say that the rioting came first, while 
foreign tourists say that police gunfire ignited the subsequent violence. 
</P>
<P>
The official New China News Agency has reported that 11 Tibetans and one 
policeman have died in the violence. Most tourists have placed the number 
killed this week at 20 to 50. Some Tibetans in Lhasa have told tourists that 
about 100 people died. 
</P>
<P>
China, which has firmly controlled Tibet since 1951, views advocacy of Tibetan 
independence as treason. The region was part of the Chinese empire during the 
Qing Dynasty but had de facto independence after 1911. 
</P>
<P>
Friday is the 30th anniversary of the beginning of an abortive anti-Chinese 
uprising that resulted in the Dalai Lama, traditionally the temporal and 
spiritual ruler of Tibet, fleeing to exile in India. Until martial law was 
declared, there were widespread expectations among Chinese authorities and 
Tibetans that Friday might be a day of especially severe conflict. March 17, 
the anniversary of the day the Dalai Lama fled Lhasa, has been viewed as 
another potential trouble date. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear whether any Tibetans will dare to stage demonstrations now that 
thousands of Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers are deployed in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama's administration-in-exile in India issued a statement Wednesday 
condemning the declaration of martial law but reiterating a call for 
negotiations on Tibet's future. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the current tragic events, we are still ready to hold talks with the 
Chinese so that a peaceful solution can be found," Tashi Wongdi, the Dalai 
Lama's chief representative in New Delhi, declared. "We are willing to meet the 
Chinese any day in Geneva." 
</P>
<P>
China offered last year to hold talks with the Dalai Lama if he first dropped 
demands for Tibetan independence. The Dalai Lama accepted the offer but wants 
the agenda to discuss "a self-governing democratic entity" in Tibet that would 
leave only defense and foreign affairs in Beijing's hands. China views this 
proposal as a disguised form of independence. Although contacts between the two 
sides continue, there has been no visible progress toward opening formal talks. 
</P>
<P>
The exiled leader's statement expressed fear that with martial law in place, 
China may "resort to more repressive methods." 
</P>
<P>
"The imposition of martial law reveals that the Chinese have lost control of 
the situation in Tibet," it added. "If, as the Chinese claim, only a handful of 
people are involved, we don't see any reason why they have to resort to such an 
extreme step." 
</P>
<P>
A report from Lhasa on Wednesday by the New China News Agency used almost 
idyllic terms to describe the quick results of martial law. The agency said 
shopkeepers and Buddhist worshipers praised the return of order to the city. 
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged Tibetan woman who came out to pray at the Jokhang Temple in 
central Lhasa was quoted as declaring: "Since martial law was declared, I have 
a strong sense of safety. I needn't worry any more that flying stones might 
hurt or kill me when I come here simply to pray." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the only two Western correspondents known to be in Lhasa were 
detained at their hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Reuters reported from Beijing that one of its correspondents, Guy Dinmore, and 
Jasper Becker of the Guardian newspaper, both British citizens who have been in 
Lhasa the last few days, had been interrogated by police. They were then 
returned to their hotel, informed that they were "under investigation" and 
ordered not to go outside, the British agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
The New China News Agency reported early today that Dinmore and Becker were 
ordered to leave Tibet for breaking a regulation requiring Beijing-based 
correspondents to receive permission for reporting trips outside the national 
capital. The agency said that Dinmore was fined and Becker was given an oral 
warning.

WILSON TELLS A CONSTITUENT WHERE TO GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rarely does a politician tell a constituent "to hell with you," but the U.S. 
Senate's consideration of John Tower for defense secretary has become so 
acrimonious that even as bland and cautious a politician as Sen. Pete Wilson 
has taken to strong talk. 
</P>
<P>
When Los Angeles businessman William G. Kapler recently wrote Wilson a sharply 
worded letter, saying "your support of John Tower smells of political 
cronyism," Wilson waved off his secretary and wrote the reply himself. 
</P>
<P>
He signed off this way, according to a copy of the Wilson letter made available 
by Kapler: 
</P>
<P>
"I have taken the time and trouble to write this long letter," Wilson writes, " 
. . . so that you might feel strongly enough about this whole subject to want 
to know the truth so that you could form a fair judgment about Sen. Tower. 
</P>
<P>
"If I am correct in that assumption, it will have been worth the time and 
effort . . . if not, then to hell with you." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stunned by Bluntness 
</P>
<P>
Kapler is out of the country on business, but his secretary said Wednesday he 
was stunned by Wilson's bluntness. In his reply to Wilson, Kapler also said he 
was impressed with Wilson's five-page response, which he subsequently forwarded 
to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Livingstone, Wilson's press secretary, said the senator rarely has time to 
reply personally to the many letters he gets, "but this is an issue so 
important to the senator that he penned this reply himself." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a Republican, sits on the Armed Services Committee, which voted to 
reject Tower's nomination on a party-line vote. He has blasted leaks to the 
news media from an FBI report on Tower and has urged that the report be made 
public to improve Tower's chances of being confirmed by the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"The FBI reports -- which I have read and you and the American people have not 
-- make clear to any fair-minded person that these allegations (about Tower 
drinking and womanizing) range from unsubstantiated to flatly contradicted," 
Wilson writes to Kapler. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
His Problems With Report 
</P>
<P>
Wilson then details his problems with the FBI report. He says that a flight 
attendant who accused Tower of drinking a fifth of vodka on a flight "flunked 
the polygraph examination that tested the truth of his story." 
</P>
<P>
And he writes Kapler that a businessman who said he saw Tower drunk in a hotel 
bar on three occasions some years ago "turns out to be a Democratic Party 
professional, and Sen. Tower was not in Washington on any of the three dates." 
</P>
<P>
The senator acknowledges that "John Tower did drink too much in the early 1970s 
. . . but he has not done so for at least 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson chastises Kapler further, saying: "I know John Tower. You do not. He is, 
Mr. Kapler, 'the best' America could have as secretary of defense." 
</P>
<P>
After he signed the letter, Wilson decided he had a little more to say on the 
subject and added a two-page "P.S." 
</P>
<P>
In it, he notes that one of Tower's strongest opponents, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), 
had once been involved in a hit-and-run incident that took place in 1964 before 
he was elected to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reports on the incident, which Wilson included, implied that Nunn had 
been drinking before the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, had the voters (of Georgia) applied the present day 'Nunn standard' 
to his conduct, he would have flunked the test," Wilson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis had been elected President and 
nominated Nunn for defense secretary, Wilson writes, he would not have voted 
against Nunn's confirmation "on those undisputed facts of a past alcohol 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
But Kapler was not convinced. 
</P>
<P>
In his reply to Wilson's letter, he said: "You have earned my respect with this 
response, but I feel that you have missed the point in my letter. . . . You 
ignore morality and integrity in your defense of John Tower. You and many of 
your colleagues know that this man had difficulty with alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"He has openly and freely admitted to adultery. . . . I and my friends are 
tired of the arrogance of office that allows politicians to selectively forgive 
some and yet prosecute others. I would like to think you have the courage to 
get above politics and do what is morally right."

STUART HAMBLEN, EARLY SINGING COWBOY STAR, DIES AT 80 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stuart Hamblen, a singing cowboy star in an era when there were but a few of 
them riding the range, died Wednesday at St. John's Hospital and Health Center 
in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Hamblen was a recovered alcoholic who abandoned booze but not broadcasting 
after a tent-show conversion by evangelist Billy Graham. He was 80, and had 
lapsed into a coma after surgery Feb. 28 to remove a malignant brain tumor, 
said Armen Markarian, a spokesman for the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Hamblen has arguably been credited with being radio's first singing cowboy. But 
if he wasn't its first, he certainly was its most colorful. 
</P>
<P>
He was as well known for his tall stories as he was his songs ("This Old 
House," "It Is No Secret What God Can Do" and "Remember Me, I'm the One Who 
Loves You.") 
</P>
<P>
Years after he had abandoned the wild life of his earlier years in which he 
once flushed an escaped black panther out of Thousand Oaks with his prized 
hounds, he still loved to tell about such times as when a bucking bronco he 
once was riding in a rodeo fled to a nearby peach orchard "and started to prune 
the trees with my poor, bruised body." 
</P>
<P>
That was a time in which he also was credited with being one of the West's best 
teller of tales since Will Rogers, although a friend noted quietly that "Stuart 
has never been guilty of understatement in his life. He's the man who sold ice 
to the man who sold ice to the Eskimos." 
</P>
<P>
He also was one of those old cowboys who remembered just enough of the days of 
the Old West to miss them. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a Methodist minister, Hamblen was born in Kellyville, Tex., on Oct. 
26, 1908. He began his career when he was 18 after winning a talent contest in 
Dallas. With the $50 prize, he headed for Camden, N.J., where he recorded for 
the forerunner of RCA Victor Recording. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived in Hollywood in 1928 and for the next 22 years was at the top of the 
country-western field, first as "Cowboy Joe," then as a member of the original 
Beverly Hillbillies, radio's first Western singing group, and later as host of 
such programs as "Covered Wagon Jubilee," "King Cowboy and his Woolly West 
Review" and "Stuart Hamblen and His Lucky Stars." 
</P>
<P>
Hamblen was a prolific songwriter, often turning out a tune in a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to write music," he said in a 1976 interview with The Times. 
"And for me, it could be anywhere. I can be up in the mountains, by a stream, 
and all of a sudden a tune will come into my head and I'll start writin' lyrics 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote 'This Old House' that way. I was in the mountains and found this old 
prospector dead in his cabin. I saw curtains, so that meant a woman had been 
there. I saw kids' things lyin' around. And they were all gone now. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Ain't a gonna leave this house no longer, 
</P>
<P>
 I'm gettin' ready to meet the saints. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Clooney's recording of "This Old House" became a million-seller. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1930s and 1940s, Hamblen appeared in a number of low budget 
Westerns, usually as the villain, with John Wayne, Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Bob 
Steele and other cowboy stars. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper clippings also reflect other "credits," arrests for speeding, 
resisting arrest, ignoring traffic tickets -- even pleading no contest to drunk 
driving in 1965, 13 years after he ran as a Prohibition Party candidate for 
President. 
</P>
<P>
(He lost, of course, to Dwight D. Eisenhower, but later couldn't resist noting 
that he had been defeated by "a mere 25 million votes. But I sure got more 
votes than Jerry Brown" -- when the California governor ran for President in 
1976 and 1980.) 
</P>
<P>
He also loved horse racing and owned one of the leading stables in the West. 
Two of his horses, El Lobo and Reveille won big stakes races. 
</P>
<P>
He had first tried to put all the mischief of his early years behind him when 
he attended a Billy Graham revival in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd always been a rough man," Hamblen said years later, "but my big problem 
was not being able to leave the booze alone. My daddy was a Methodist minister 
and I guess I was the original juvenile delinquent. I just loved to fight too, 
and I suppose I did get thrown into jail a few times." 
</P>
<P>
Two years after his conversion, Hamblen retired from radio and films and with 
his wife, Suzy, spent the next 20 years traveling across the country speaking 
before youth organizations and prison inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Having been convinced by KLAC General Manager Bill Ward that the airwaves 
offered a more sweeping pulpit, he returned to that medium in 1971 with his 
nationally syndicated "Cowboy Church of the Air," an hourlong show of religious 
songs mixed in with stories, always with a message. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing I want to make clear is that I'm no preacher," he said. "We tell 
stories instead of sermons. 
</P>
<P>
"And we don't accept any donations even though some people, bless 'em, choose 
to send money." 
</P>
<P>
What he tried to get across, said the old cowboy who was inducted into the 
Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1976, is that "I've accepted the Lord Jesus Christ, 
and what a difference Christianity can make in a man's life." 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 56 years and three daughters.

STATES DELAY NEW MEDICAL BENEFIT FOR POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most states, including California, are ignoring a new federal law that requires 
them to pay Medicare insurance premiums and other medical expenses for the 
poor, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) charged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, people with incomes of $423 a month or less are supposed to be 
exempt from paying the $31.90 a month charged for Medicare Part B, the 
insurance that helps pay doctor bills. This charge is deducted monthly by the 
federal government from Social Security checks of more than 30 million Medicare 
beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
The new law, which took effect on Jan. 1, orders states to pay the Part B 
premium plus other expenses for those whose incomes fall below 85% of the 
federal definition of poverty, which is $5,980 a year for an individual. The 
law, thus, applies to those with annual incomes of $5,083 or $423.59 a month. 
</P>
<P>
But many state governments are ignoring the law or delaying its implementation. 
</P>
<P>
"My own state of California doesn't intend to implement it until next January," 
Waxman told a news conference. "We've asked for an explanation and haven't 
received one. I don't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Allenby, California secretary of health and welfare, said later Wednesday 
that priority legislation will be introduced this week to authorize the state 
to pay benefits on behalf of poor individuals. "Our (state) law does not allow 
us to take any action like this unless the Legislature concurs," he said. "We 
will try to expedite action on the bill. I think it is relatively 
noncontroversial." 
</P>
<P>
When the bill is passed, the state, working with the Social Security 
Administration, will try to identify and contact poor people who are eligible 
for the new benefit, for which individuals will be required to fill out an 
application. The state will send names of the eligible to the Social Security 
Administration, which will stop deducting the $31.90 a month from their Social 
Security checks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Not Notified 
</P>
<P>
Although the benefit was supposed to begin on Jan. 1, California will not make 
retroactive payments for money lost during months before the bill is passed and 
eligible recipients are identified to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman said the Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, did 
not send guidelines to states until December. And federal officials rejected a 
request by some members of Congress to notify the public by including 
information with Social Security checks. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 2 million persons over age 65 may be eligible for the benefit, 
included in the catastrophic care legislation, a Medicare benefits expansion 
approved by Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
Poor people of all ages are helped with medical bills under the federal 
Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal in California. The new benefit is designed 
to help people who have too much income to qualify for Medicaid but still live 
in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Besides paying the monthly Medicare premium, the new benefit covers the first 
day of hospital charges and the part of doctor bills not covered by Medicare. 
In effect, low-income beneficiaries get complete free coverage for all hospital 
and doctor bills. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman said that only 11 states had implemented the new benefit in January, 
when it was to begin. Eighteen states are to begin the benefit this month, but 
it is unclear how many will make vigorous efforts to notify potential 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
The survey showing extensive non-compliance with the law was compiled by the 
Villers Foundation, a nonprofit group focusing on issues concerning the elderly 
population.

COUNCIL SUGGESTS LAPD IS TOO SOFT ON ABORTION FOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In anticipation of massive anti-abortion demonstrations later this month, the 
City Council on Wednesday grilled Los Angeles police officials over their 
low-key handling of disturbances at area women's clinics last month and 
demanded that the department toughen its enforcement of trespassing laws during 
sit-ins by Operation Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Although hundreds of protesters with Operation Rescue effectively closed two 
clinics on Pico Boulevard in February, police made no arrests, and City Council 
members on Wednesday blasted LAPD Cmdr. John White for what they perceived as a 
double standard in enforcing trespassing laws. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Molina Complaint 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about different standards here," said Councilwoman Gloria 
Molina. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it's Mexican day workers or abortion protesters, there cannot be any 
difference" in enforcing trespassing laws, said Molina. She referred to police 
arrests of day workers after complaints from area businesses. 
</P>
<P>
As another example, when downtown business operators complained about homeless 
people blocking entrances to their stores, "the police came in and took care of 
it," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
Still, White told the council that there would be no automatic arrests of 
protesters blocking entrances to women's clinics and harassing patients. 
</P>
<P>
At last month's protest, one patient was injured as she attempted to get 
through the crowd. Nationwide, more than 7,000 Operation Rescue protesters have 
been arrested at demonstrations similar to those in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue officials have vowed to descend on Los Angeles area family 
planning clinics March 22 through 25. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter granted an American Civil 
Liberties Union request for a temporary restraining order to keep protesters 
from blocking entrances and demonstrating closer than 15 feet from clinic 
entrances and exits. Because the protesters have ignored similar orders in 
demonstrations in several other cities, ACLU attorney Carol Soble said when 
Hatter issued his order that its effectiveness would depend on police 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ready for Trouble 
</P>
<P>
White assured the council the police will be ready for trouble. "The Emergency 
Operations Center will be activated," he said. "Metropolitan Division will have 
four platoons (160 officers) on standby. We'll have our maximum uniform 
deployment." 
</P>
<P>
But White also told the council that clinic operators would have to 
specifically request that demonstrators be removed, or make citizens' arrests 
on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Under heated questioning by council members who wanted to know why the police 
had not done more to defend the clinics last month, White said officials at 
those clinics did not request assistance. But Planned Parenthood officials said 
police discouraged clinic operators from seeking their help. 
</P>
<P>
Several City Council members are demanding a meeting with Police Chief Daryl F. 
Gates. 
</P>
<P>
"This issue needs to be addressed and addressed from the top," said 
Yaroslavsky, who has been joined by Councilmen Richard Alatorre and Michael Woo 
in requesting the meeting with Gates. 
</P>
<P>
Although they were assured by White that the LAPD's policy is uniform, the 
council voted 11-0 for a Molina motion directing the LAPD to use the same 
policy in all trespassing cases.

FOUR PRINCIPALS IN MAJOR ALIEN SMUGGLING RING SEIZED IN RAID, INS SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A raid by federal agents on a South-Central Los Angeles "drop house" led to the 
arrests of four principals in a major smuggling operation suspected of 
transporting hundreds of illegal aliens by air to New York, Chicago and Miami 
in recent weeks, immigration officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the ring as "one of the nation's largest and most sophisticated 
alien smuggling operations," Immigration and Naturalization Service Western 
Regional Commissioner Harold Ezell said he expected that the Tuesday raid -- 
which also netted 21 illegal aliens -- would soon be followed by the arrests of 
other "key principals" of the group in New York. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials said there was accumulating evidence that the ring broken up 
Tuesday had worked in concert with other transcontinental smuggling operations, 
suggesting that the methods employed by "coyotes" who shuttle illegal workers 
on commercial flights are more sophisticated than initially believed.

<P>
"Every smuggler we've picked up (in the last two weeks) had some connection 
with this organization," said INS Los Angeles District Director Ernest 
Gustafson. 
</P>
<P>
Before Tuesday's raid, INS agents had arrested eight other suspected smugglers 
since the first widespread arrests of immigrants began in late February at Los 
Angeles International Airport and air terminals in Atlanta and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Records seized during recent arrests and interviews with detained illegal 
aliens indicate that smugglers from several independent rings have been working 
together to link up with immigrant clients, Gustafson said. Documents found 
Tuesday showed that the South-Central smuggling ring brought in more than 
$500,000 in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"These groups are sharing referrals, money and specialties," Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration officials estimated that before the recent wave of arrests, the 
smuggling ring had flown "several hundred" aliens to destinations on the East 
Coast and in the Midwest. Among them were large groups of immigrants from the 
Dominican Republic and Brazil -- countries that had not been previously 
considered major "sending areas" of undocumented aliens to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
INS spokesman Ron Rogers said that the South-Central group was responsible for 
transporting "a majority" of the 79 illegal aliens who were arrested Feb. 27 at 
Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport on their way to New York, the first 
of what has proven to be a series of large-scale arrests on airplanes and in 
drop houses. 
</P>
<P>
Agents from the INS' so-called "Coyote Busters," a newly formed task force 
aimed at smugglers of undocumented workers, began surveillance three days ago 
on the one-story stucco drop house in the 500 block of West 85th Street after 
receiving information from several of the immigrants arrested in Atlanta that 
it had been used to temporarily house them, Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surrounded the House 
</P>
<P>
At about 7 p.m. Tuesday night, INS agents surrounded the three-room house. In 
the kitchen, they found eight illegal aliens hemmed in around a stove, frying 
potatoes. The others were wedged into a tiny bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't leave an animal in those kind of unsanitary conditions," Ezell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The INS commissioner, who joined other immigration officials on the raid, said 
that one elderly immigrant told authorities she was held in the drop house for 
10 days. The woman reported that after paying the smugglers, she rode buses 
north from Mexico City to Tijuana and then to the border. After being led with 
others across the crossing point, Ezell said, her group was driven north from 
San Diego to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A fee schedule seized at the house listed the payments required from the 
immigrants for the services they required. The fees ranged from $950 to $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It all depended on what you needed," Rogers said. "If they took care of 
everything, it could get pretty steep." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use 'Redeye' Flights 
</P>
<P>
Typically, Gustafson said, the smugglers would wait until the late night 
"redeye" flights to order their tickets because the prices were cheap and there 
were fewer security and airport administrative personnel to notice their large 
group of immigrant clients. 
</P>
<P>
After the recent wave of arrests began, the smuggling operation tried to change 
its tactics. Several telephone numbers taken from arrested immigrants in New 
York tipped off the agency that the smugglers were planning to fly aliens from 
Los Angeles to Las Vegas, and then on to New York -- avoiding the closely 
watched Los Angeles-to-Atlanta-to-New York route. 
</P>
<P>
The bolstered presence of INS agents at Los Angeles airports, Ezell said, has 
kept illegal aliens from leaving many of the 30 to 40 suspected drop houses in 
Southern California. INS officials added that in addition to the Tuesday 
arrests, they have begun surveillance at a dozen other drop houses in 
preparation for similar raids. 
</P>
<P>
The four men arrested and held on suspicion of smuggling were identified as 
Hector Gomez-Miranda, 23, of Guatemala; Martin Garcia-Saldana, 18, of Mexico; 
Orlando Navarete-Leones, 23, of El Salvador and Dubon Serrano, 21, also from El 
Salvador. All were described as "middlemen" in the operation. The 21 illegal 
aliens will be allowed to return voluntarily to Mexico or face a deportation 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials also announced that four Mexican immigrants were arrested at Los 
Angeles International Airport Wednesday on their way to take a flight to 
Chicago. The arrests raised the total number of illegal aliens apprehended at 
Los Angeles-area airports to 439 since Feb. 28.

HELP AWAITS PARAPLEGIC, IF HE'LL JUST REAPPEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

George Donovan is out there, somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
And he's got a friend. Plus a lot of other people who say they want to help him 
get a new wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
That's an improvement over Tuesday night, when it seemed there just wasn't 
anybody in Los Angeles who felt like taking care of the 47-year-old paraplegic. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they found Donovan -- a homeless man who usually sleeps in an alley 
near the Greyhound bus station downtown -- propped up against a wall at 6th and 
Main streets at about 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan, who said he is a Vietnam veteran from Illinois, told the officers that 
two men had pretended to befriend him before dumping him from his motorized 
wheelchair and stealing his watch, his wallet and his last $6. 
</P>
<P>
The thieves then dashed off with the chair, leaving Donovan lying helpless on 
the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan said passers-by ignored him. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't believe how many people I asked to call the police and they 
wouldn't do nothing," he said Tuesday night. "I guess they didn't want to get 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Search for Help 
</P>
<P>
The police officers who eventually found Donovan took him to the Central 
Division station, where they said they tried for three hours to find some 
agency that would put him up for the night. 
</P>
<P>
"No one seemed willing to take him," Sgt. Dale Bootrow said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bootrow, local missions said they were full, the Veterans 
Administration explained that it couldn't take Donovan in because he wasn't 
sick or injured and the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center said the same 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Department of Public Social Services couldn't offer a room because 
Donovan, who said he was crippled in a construction accident several years ago 
in Kansas City, wasn't ambulatory. The district attorney's Victims Emergency 
Response Team said it couldn't help because he wasn't hurt, Bootrow said. And 
detoxification centers -- which were called even though Donovan wasn't drunk -- 
said they they had run out of beds. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while there, the only solution I could see was to take him over to 
Pershing Square and leave him on a bench," Bootrow said. "But then, what's 
going to happen when daylight comes? What's he going to do then?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skid Row Quarters 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Union Rescue Mission on Skid Row agreed to take Donovan in and 
gave him a crutch. About half an hour later, however, Donovan complained of 
abdominal pains, so an ambulance was called and he was transferred to 
County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan was checked and found to be in good health, officials said. About 2 
a.m. Wednesday, they said, someone stopped by the hospital, chatted with 
Donovan and agreed to take him where he wanted to go -- to a Veterans 
Administration hospital. 
</P>
<P>
VA officials said that Donovan still hadn't checked into any of their 
facilities as of Wednesday afternoon. "We can't find him anywhere," said Larry 
Caird, a VA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Caird also said the VA had no record of his having ever applied for veteran's 
benefits. The hometown he listed on his VA identification card -- Anderson, 
Ill. -- is actually a "township," or district, in Clark County, and not a city 
as such. John Presz, the chief of police of Marshall -- the only town in 
Anderson township -- said that he had checked around and found no one there who 
remembered a George Donovan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offers of Help 
</P>
<P>
The only clue to Donovan's whereabouts Wednesday afternoon was his checkout 
entry at the medical center. That said he had left at 2:10 a.m. with "a 
friend." By noon Wednesday, offers of help were beginning to pour in in 
response to news reports of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Ray McCann, manager of communications at the Union Rescue Mission, said there 
had been "response across the nation," with offers to replace the wheelchair 
"and folks calling in who want to help out financially." Officer Ron Baer, who 
was working the front desk Wednesday at the Police Department's Central 
Station, said he handled a call from a manufacturer of motorized wheelchairs 
who offered one free. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem was, nobody seemed to know where to find George Donovan and 
his friend.

EX-OFFICER GETS LIFE IN CONTRACT KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Los Angeles Police Officer Robert Von Villas was sentenced Wednesday to 
life in prison without the possibility of parole in the 1983 contract slaying 
of a Northridge businessman. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge sentenced Von Villas, 44, of Simi Valley, despite claims 
by Villas and his attorneys that at least four of the jurors who convicted him 
of murder in November were influenced by discussions outside the jury room. 
</P>
<P>
Another former Los Angeles police officer, Richard Herman Ford, 48, was also 
convicted of murder and was sentenced in March to life in prison without parole 
in the slaying of the businessman, Thomas Weed, 52. 
</P>
<P>
The two former Devonshire Division officers accepted $20,000 from Weed's 
ex-wife, Janie E. Ogilvie in exchange for killing him, authorities said. 
Ogilvie was allowed to plead guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for her 
testimony and was sentenced to 15 years to life.

YOUTH CHARGED IN TEACHER'S STABBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ninth-grader accused of stabbing his English teacher at a Sylmar junior high 
school was charged Wednesday with assault with a deadly weapon on a school 
employee, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old Pacoima youth, who was not identified, is scheduled to be 
arraigned today in Sylmar Juvenile Court, said Deputy District Atty. Michelle 
Rosenblatt. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect is accused of stabbing Cynthia Edwards, 37, in front of a classroom 
full of students Monday at Olive Vista Junior High School. Edwards, of 
Palmdale, suffered a three-inch-deep wound in her back and was recovering at 
Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police arrested the youth, who had a history of minor disciplinary 
problems at school, on suspicion of attempted murder. Citing juvenile privacy 
laws, Rosenblatt said she could not disclose details about the case that led to 
the filing of a lesser charge.

MARY PICKFORD CENTER DEDICATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Buddy Rogers was at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in Griffith 
Park Wednesday to dedicate the Mary Pickford Education Center and Library. The 
center has three classrooms, a docent library and the administrative complex 
for the Western museum's education department. 
</P>
<P>
The center was funded by a $225,000 grant from the Mary Pickford Foundation, a 
donation made "because programs at the museum will emphasize the role of women 
and minorities, something about which Mary felt strongly," said Rogers, husband 
of the late film star. Only once before has the Mary Pickford Foundation 
awarded funding at that level, he said, when a similar amount was given for the 
Mary Pickford Theater at the Library of Congress.

NEW TRIAL ASKED IN ROCK HUDSON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawyers for actor Rock Hudson's estate and personal secretary requested a new 
trial in Los Angeles Superior Court Wednesday, alleging a jury was excessive in 
handing down a $21.7-million verdict against their clients for Hudson's not 
telling his former lover he had AIDS. Lawyers also said a new trial was 
warranted because of alleged errors by the judge and misconduct by jurors. 
</P>
<P>
A jury of seven women and five men awarded Hudson's former lover, Marc 
Christian, $14.5 million on Feb. 16, deciding that the late actor conspired 
with his secretary, Mark Miller, to keep his acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome infection a secret from Christian so they could continue having sex 
together. 
</P>
<P>
The jury then awarded $7.25 million against Miller in exemplary and punitive 
damages to punish him for his "despicable conduct" in helping Hudson hide his 
illness.

2 INFANTS, WOMAN KILLED IN FIRES; CANDLE, HEATER BLAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two infants and a woman believed to be the grandmother of one of them died in 
separate Los Angeles-area fires, one of them blamed on a candle used in an 
apartment where the electricity had been turned off for non-payment, 
authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Flames drove 15 residents from a two-story fourplex in South-Central Los 
Angeles shortly after midnight and trapped an upstairs resident and an infant 
boy, identified as Lorrell Allen, 11 months, in a back bedroom, where the 
bodies were found. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office withheld identification of the woman, but residents of the 
gutted stucco-and-wood building identified her as Mary Key, 63, Lorrell's 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Dwayne Sudduth, 29, a friend of the dead woman, said he was sleeping in a front 
room of the apartment at 601 1/2 E. 27th St. when the sound of a smoke alarm 
jarred him awake and he heard screams and cries for help. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to get Miss Mary and her grandson, but the smoke took my breath away 
and I had to come out," said Sudduth, standing in the debris-strewn front yard. 
"The last words I heard her say was, 'Help. Somebody come and get me.' " 
</P>
<P>
"It started off a candle on a crate," Sudduth said. "The candle burned down and 
caught the crate on fire." 
</P>
<P>
Electricity was turned off in the apartment on Jan. 18, according to the 
Department of Water and Power. The Fire Department said the cause of the fire 
is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Six fire companies and a rescue ambulance responded to the blaze, reported at 
12:30 a.m. and extinguished by 1:03 a.m. Damage to the building and contents 
was estimated at $87,000. 
</P>
<P>
Residents left homeless by the fire were provided shelter by the Red Cross at 
the Sand Piper Motel on South Central Avenue. At the motel, Nakima Whitley, a 
seventh grader at John Adams Junior High School, recalled the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"It was scary," she said. "My mom came and woke us up and we ran down the 
stairs. I heard a lot of screaming . . . The house just started blazing. Miss 
Mary and Lorrell couldn't get saved." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Portable Heater Blamed 
</P>
<P>
In a second fire, a portable heater was blamed for starting a blaze late 
Tuesday that cost the life of 9-month-old Bianca Lashange Collins in an 
apartment at 11248 Mariposa Ave. in the unincorporated Athens area near South 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The child's father, John Collins, 36, and two sheriff's deputies from the 
Lennox substation, Richard Bowman and Craig Anderson, crawled on hands and 
knees into the burning apartment. 
</P>
<P>
When Collins was overcome by smoke, the two deputies dragged the distraught 
father from the building and then returned in an effort to reach the child. 
But, sheriff's officials said, the two deputies were driven back by intense 
heat and smoke. Both were treated for smoke inhalation, as was Collins, at 
Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital in Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
County firefighters put out the blaze in about a half hour, a spokesperson 
said.

PRIESTS ASSAIL WAGE ABUSE OF ILLEGAL ALIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One man reportedly washed pots and pans for $80 a week, less than half the 
minimum wage. A Nicaraguan refugee said she worked as a housekeeper and 
baby-sitter for nearly seven months, repeatedly asking -- unsuccessfully -- to 
be paid overtime for long hours and weekend work. 
</P>
<P>
And two illegal aliens from Mexico and one from Honduras said they cleaned a 
pizza parlor for two days, and were paid in pizza. 
</P>
<P>
Two activist Roman Catholic priests gave those examples to illustrate what they 
denounced Wednesday as growing abuse of immigrant workers who, caught in the 
vise of new immigration laws, are paid too little or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
Fathers Gregory J. Boyle and Michael Kennedy said they can document dozens of 
cases of workers who have been exploited by employers. The two priests are 
based at churches that have come to serve as nightly sanctuaries for scores of 
illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
"The employers count on the fact that they (illegal alien workers) live in 
fear," said Boyle, pastor of Dolores Mission Church, at a press conference at 
Our Lady Queen of Angels Church, or La Placita. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, associate pastor at La Placita, said he has seen the number of workers 
complaining of receiving what he called "scandalous and sinful" wages swell in 
recent months to 20 a week. With the advent of employer sanctions, the priests 
said, thousands of illegal immigrants who did not qualify for amnesty are open 
to increased exploitation, a phenomenon that state labor officials say they too 
are beginning to detect. 
</P>
<P>
The priests provided details -- names and addresses of employers, dates of 
work, wages allegedly owed -- for nine cases. Most of the employers named did 
not return phone calls. Those contacted denied the accusations, saying they had 
paid what they owed. 
</P>
<P>
Concepcion Paredes, a native of Leon, Nicaragua, who said she has amnesty 
papers, told reporters that her employer refused to pay her for overtime and 
Saturdays. She said she worked for nearly seven months as a housekeeper and 
baby-sitter for a Reseda family and was owed $6,022 in back wages. The family 
denied the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
Paredes sought help from the Legal Aid Foundation and filed a complaint with 
the state Labor Commission. She has taken her former employer to court. An 
appearance is scheduled for next month. 
</P>
<P>
Illegal alien workers can turn to state labor agencies when their employers 
refuse to pay them the minimum wage, according to Legal Aid attorney Tony 
Mischel. Residency status is considered irrelevant in wage-abuse cases. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Miller, regional manager of the bureau of field enforcement of the Labor 
Commission, said his office has seen a "substantial" increase of wage-abuse 
complaints in the last two months, especially from workers in the garment 
industry. He said the increase may be attributed to a combination of the new 
immigration law and last year's increase of the state minimum wage to $4.25. 
Miller's office is assigned to investigate complaints in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle and Kennedy said that Martin Hidalgo from Mexico worked at the Librerias 
Mexico bookstore in downtown Los Angeles for five days last month, but that his 
employer only paid him half the minimum wage. The employer still owes him 
$93.75, the priests said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Manager's View 
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Fernandez, who identified himself as manager of the bookstore, said 
Hidalgo had been paid what he had agreed to work for: $170 for five days of 
work. Fernandez added that Hidalgo was lucky to be working anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle and Kennedy said many workers, because they are illegal aliens, are 
afraid to complain and will endure poor treatment or low wages because any kind 
of employment is better than nothing.

A year after an unarmed Cerritos man was shot and killed by Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies after a lengthy car chase, 30 family members and friends 
gathered Wednesday in Cypress at the grave of Hong Pyo Lee to remember him and 
to press their demands for legal action against the deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office, following a six-week 
investigation last spring, cleared five deputies of criminal wrongdoing in the 
shooting, which drew loud cries of racial discrimination and police brutality 
from the Korean community. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lee's parents have filed a $5.5-million federal lawsuit alleging 
that Lee's civil rights were violated. The U.S. Department of Justice is also 
conducting an investigation into the civil rights issue, according to attorneys 
for the Lee family and for the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's service at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Lee's relatives and 
their attorney, George V. Denny III, maintained that pretrial depositions from 
two Long Beach police officers, Richard R. Boatwright and Mario Razo, reinforce 
their contention that the 21-year-old Lee was killed wrongfully. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach officers, who had pursued Lee along with the deputies and 
witnessed the fatal shooting, both stated in sworn depositions that they were 
"amazed" at the deputies' conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, according to the deposition transcript, seven-year police veteran 
Boatwright said that, after the shooting, he turned to Razo, and said, "We just 
observed the sheriff's execute somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Boatwright nor Razo, who said in his deposition that he could not 
remember Boatwright using the word execution, could be reached Wednesday for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney David D. Lawrence, representing the Sheriff's Department, Wednesday 
questioned the Long Beach officers' accounts, saying, "I'm confident the 
deputies acted properly and did what they had to do." 
</P>
<P>
At the graveside service, Lee's father, liquor store owner Sung Kyu Lee, 
tearfully declared, "It is wrong what happened and justice should be served 
here. . . . We have to get to the bottom of this." 
</P>
<P>
The incident began when Lee, driving late at night in an unincorporated area 
near Lynwood, was spotted by sheriff's deputies running a stop sign. Rather 
than pull over, Lee accelerated and led deputies on a 15-mile chase that ended 
in a north Long Beach industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guns Drawn 
</P>
<P>
The five deputies got out of their vehicles with their guns drawn, and one, 
John Chapman, 30, approached the driver's side of Lee's vehicle, demanding that 
Lee get out. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies told investigators later that they fired at Lee only after he 
suddenly shifted his car into reverse and attempted to run them down. That 
account was corroborated by a truck driver, who told investigators that he was 
parked nearby and saw the entire incident. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's report concluded that the deputies acted in 
self-defense when they shot Lee nine times. An autopsy had found traces of 
cocaine in his body. 
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard B. Healey acknowledged in his report that 
Razo and Boatwright contradicted the five deputies and the truck driver. The 
two Long Beach officers told investigators that Lee's car never moved backward 
toward the deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"Such conflicts in the evidence are not unusual," Healey wrote, "and do not 
necessarily have sinister significance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Give Added Details 
</P>
<P>
In their subsequent pretrial depositions last October, the Long Beach officers 
elaborated. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the lives of the deputies appeared to be in danger when they fired 
their weapons, Razo replied, "Not what I could see, no." The officer added that 
the shooting did not appear to be a justifiable homicide. 
</P>
<P>
Boatwright, when asked how he characterized the incident to Razo, said he "used 
the word execution." Razo, however, said he could not remember Boatwright using 
the term. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Lawrence on Wednesday questioned the "execution" statement, saying 
that "if it happened, it would have been remembered (by Razo)." 
</P>
<P>
Healey, contacted Wednesday, said Boatwright did not use the term execution 
during the district attorney's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Be Reopened 
</P>
<P>
"We're always open to the possibility of reopening a case if dramatic new 
evidence comes forward," Healey said. 
</P>
<P>
Denny, who is representing the Lee family in their civil suit scheduled for 
trial in July, said Wednesday, "I would like to see the case reopened (but) I 
have severe doubts whether, at this time, (the district attorney's office) has 
any inclination that way at all." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think justice has been served yet," Denny added. " . . . It is clear 
from the testimony there was no need to shoot (Lee)."

AGENCY SCALES BACK PROPOSAL FOR YOUTH SHELTER IN HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Covenant House, a New York-based social service agency, has agreed to scale 
back plans for an emergency youth shelter in Hollywood. But the agreement, 
announced Tuesday by Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo, has failed to 
settle a turf fight over who will serve runaway and homeless youths in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Although the agreement reduces the number of Covenant House beds from 100 to 
60, it was immediately rejected by Gary Yates, the director of a rival youth 
program operated by Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Yates objected to the size of the shelter and its location in Hollywood, saying 
there is greater need in other areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
He also protested that he was not a party to the agreement between Woo and 
Covenant House. "When I was informed about it, it was a done deal," he said. 
"There was no chance for feedback." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$70-Million Budget 
</P>
<P>
The competitive struggle among social service agencies began when Covenant 
House arrived on the Hollywood scene last year. With its $70-million annual 
budget, a professional public relations campaign and an aggressive fund-raising 
drive, Covenant House is seen by some existing agencies, including Children's 
Hospital, as a threat. Founded by Father Bruce Ritter on the Lower East Side of 
New York City 20 years ago, Covenant House has grown into a social service 
powerhouse that operates shelters for runaway youths in six U.S. and Canadian 
cities and in four Central American countries. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Donahue, Covenant House executive director, said her agency's program is 
"very intimidating to other service providers." 
</P>
<P>
Woo said in an interview that he intervened because "a turf battle" was shaping 
up between competing agencies in his district. "I had a meeting with service 
providers who made it clear they did not welcome Covenant House coming into the 
area." 
</P>
<P>
Covenant House's public relations campaigns and multimillion-dollar plans 
angered some existing agencies, Woo said. "They struck some people as acting 
like the General Motors of the nonprofits." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy forced cancellation of a January press conference in which Woo 
and Mayor Tom Bradley were to have welcomed Covenant House to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
After conferring with Woo, Covenant House agreed to open a smaller, 20-bed 
emergency shelter in Hollywood within three to six months that would grow to 60 
beds in two years. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Covenant House had planned to include a 40-bed, long-term Rites of 
Passage program in the shelter. Under the agreement, that program, designed to 
provide job training and counseling, will be located outside of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said Covenant House also agreed to establish a local board of directors, 
including representatives from Hollywood. The agency will work with Woo's 
office to find an acceptable location for the emergency shelter, and Woo will 
review the design of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Size and Location 
</P>
<P>
But Yates, who also is involved with other efforts to help runaway and homeless 
youths in Hollywood, said the agreement is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"The 60-bed shelter being in Hollywood is not a compromise at all," Yates said. 
"It gives Covenant House exactly what it wanted all along -- a 60-bed emergency 
shelter." 
</P>
<P>
Yates said he objects to both the size of Covenant House's proposed shelter and 
its location in Hollywood. "It's clear to me that the need is elsewhere," Yates 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said studies have shown there is a far greater need for services in 
South-Central Los Angeles, Long Beach and in the San Gabriel Valley. He said he 
believes Covenant House wants its program in Hollywood for image and 
fund-raising reasons. "It's the glitz of Hollywood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Covenant House's Donahue disputes Yates' assertions. 
</P>
<P>
"We still see a need in Hollywood," Donahue said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
In the three months since Covenant House began working with the Los Angeles 
Junior Chamber of Commerce on a nightly van program to reach runaway youths on 
the streets of Hollywood, nearly 300 youths have sought assistance, Donahue 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were immediately swamped in the Hollywood area. We were flooded with kids 
(who are) extremely receptive to getting help. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them are involved in prostitution, drug dealing, drug use, petty 
crimes -- anything they can do to survive, anything they can do to get money 
for their next meal." 
</P>
<P>
Covenant House eventually hopes to establish 20-bed satellite centers elsewhere 
in the county but is concentrating its initial efforts in Hollywood, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said she understands that "Covenant House by its nature and philosophy 
is threatening" to existing social service agencies. "There is no question they 
have felt threatened. There is little we can say to change that. We are not in 
competition with them." 
</P>
<P>
Yates said smaller social service agencies may be forced to compete with 
Covenant House in fund raising. Smaller programs for runaways in New Orleans 
and Houston folded within two years after Covenant House opened its own 
shelters in those cities, Yates said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Big Guys Come In' 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said Covenant House plans to spend $30 million to $35 million on its 
Hollywood program in the next five years. Yates said the budget for his program 
does not total $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly there are some fears about who will be left when the big guys come 
in," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
The two agencies also differ over the effectiveness of smaller versus larger 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Yates said he believes "the smaller group home is more effective." 
</P>
<P>
But Donahue defended the Covenant House approach, saying a larger shelter is 
essential to support a battery of on-site experts, including psychological and 
medical staff, educational and vocational counselors, and child development 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said Children's Hospital was "completely supportive of our program" 
until the scope of her agency's plans became known. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said that "as soon as the number 100 (beds) started floating around, we 
started getting some flak from the community (of providers)." 
</P>
<P>
The councilman said he wants to act as "kind of a broker" between the competing 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Woo said, the streets are saturated with youths who need help. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that there is a need for more services," Woo said. "I cannot 
accept the concept that there already are enough services."

YAROSLAVSKY'S FUND RAISING STARTS SLOWLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who amassed more than $1.5 million 
for his mayoral campaign, has raised less than $54,000 for his 5th District 
reelection effort so far, campaign finance reports show. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates filed campaign statements for January and February with the city 
clerk's office last week. Yaroslavsky spokeswoman Karin Caves said the 
councilman's reelection fund raising got off to a slow start because 
Yaroslavsky was busy returning money he received for the mayor's race. 
</P>
<P>
Caves said Yaroslavsky expects to raise about $200,000 for the April 11 council 
primary campaign against environmental activist Laura M. Lake, transportation 
consultant Ryan Snyder and political consultant Jack McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect to raise exactly as much as we need," Caves said. "We have a big 
lawn sign program, which costs money. We also have a major mail program." 
</P>
<P>
More than half of Yaroslavsky's 141 contributions, which came from a variety of 
sources, were at the maximum $500 level. The councilman had $33,274 at the end 
of the filing period, with the remainder going to his first districtwide 
mailing and other campaign expenses, such as salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his slow start, Yaroslavsky still outpaced his rivals in the 5th 
District campaign. Lake, seen as the councilman's toughest foe, reported 
$21,000 in contributions for the first two months of this year, while Snyder 
raised about $1,000. McGrath, a write-in candidate, was not required to file a 
campaign contributions report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fund-Raisers Planned 
</P>
<P>
Caves said Yaroslavsky will build up his bankroll with a series of 
fund-raisers. Lake, meanwhile, said she also expects to raise larger sums of 
money in coming weeks. The Westwood activist has events scheduled at the Sand 
and Sea Club, the Four Oaks restaurant and 72 Market Street restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"There's never enough money," Lake said. "But it's picking up . . . as interest 
in the campaign and awareness of the campaign come together." 
</P>
<P>
Lake's individual contributions were smaller than Yaroslavsky's on average. 
Only 19 of her 66 supporters gave the $500 maximum allowable under city law. 
Most of Lake's contributions were in the $100-to-$250 range. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder raised $1,265 from six contributors. Snyder said he hopes to raise about 
$6,000 by the end of the campaign.

CORETTA KING URGES BLACKS, JEWS TO 'START HEALING' RIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GINGER THOMPSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coretta Scott King told more than 1,000 people at Sinai Temple this week that 
the relationship between Jews and blacks has been strained by recent events: 
notably, Jesse Jackson's anti-Semitic remarks during his first presidential 
campaign and disagreement over Israel's stance in its bloody territorial 
conflict with Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
But King, widow of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., called for 
blacks and Jews to reunite, despite their disagreements, and fight to end 
racism and anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tensions' Acknowledged 
</P>
<P>
"Undeniably there have been tensions between us," King told the predominantly 
Jewish audience, "but there has always been more cooperation and friendship 
than animosity. We need to start healing the strains in our relationship." 
</P>
<P>
John Mack, president of the Los Angeles Urban League, and Edward Sanders, 
chairman of the Southern California Region of the National Conference of 
Christians and Jews, also spoke to the group. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the problems they cited included disagreements between blacks and Jews 
over affirmative action and Israel's conflict with Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Mack said the Jewish community has generally viewed affirmative action as an 
unfair quota system that has locked many of their people out of jobs or 
educational institutions. Blacks, however, see such hiring goals as insurance 
that they will be included, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urged Negotiations 
</P>
<P>
King also encouraged the Jewish community to press Israel to negotiate with 
Palestinians for a "peaceful and equitable" solution to their conflict, 
including a homeland for the Palestinian people. 
</P>
<P>
"Surely if you believe in a place for yourselves, you must believe in a place 
for others," she said, to mild applause. 
</P>
<P>
Before ending her speech, King said that despite disagreements between the 
black and Jewish communities, "We must agree to disagree as brothers and 
sisters. Disagreement need not mean separation or polarization." 
</P>
<P>
She said that since World War II, when black soldiers died to defeat Hitler, 
and the Civil Rights era, when Jews died supporting the black cause, the two 
communities have shared a covenant for justice. 
</P>
<P>
Parents must strengthen that covenant by educating young blacks and Jews about 
those struggles, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier that day, King spoke to 500 high school students at the University of 
Judaism in Bel-Air, urging them to become "lifelong activists for peace and 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
Mack echoed King's call for education. "After you cut through all the problems 
between blacks and Jews," he said, "the challenge facing all of us is the 
challenge in making sure our younger generation learns about and understands 
the mutual destiny for which we have fought. Our kids don't know about it and 
often don't care about it. They're too busy trying to be yuppies and buppies." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, audience members at both locations said King did not really address 
the controversial issues. They said they had hoped that she would lash out 
against black leaders like Jackson and Louis Farrakhan, a Muslim whose speeches 
carry a blatant anti-white message. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most people were disappointed that (King) glossed over the issues that 
are really on our minds," said a temple employee, who asked not to be 
identified. "She went through a lot of the old struggles of the Civil Rights 
era, but she never came to terms with today's problems, like Jesse Jackson's 
remarks. I guess she can't go against her own people even if they're wrong." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is intolerable for no one to speak out against a man like 
(Farrakhan) who invites violence and hatred," said a businessman who attended 
the speech and declined to be identified. "If a black were slurred by a Jew, 
I'd hope that respected Jewish leaders would condemn that behavior, and I think 
that's what the Jewish community is looking for from respected black leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Baness, 30, of Beverly Hills, said: "It was an honor for me to hear 
Coretta speak. She is truly a legend. But I think her comments were a little 
too polite."

BOARD CANDIDATE DROPS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Garcia, a candidate for the Los Angeles school board's 2nd District seat 
in the April election, has announced his decision to withdraw from the race. 
Garcia, an English and history teacher at Hamilton High School, endorsed 
challenger Mark Slavkin over incumbent Alan Gershman. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, whose campaign never picked up much support, said he was dropping out 
of the race to devote more time to his students. 
</P>
<P>
"I am committed to my students," he said. "I feel this is an important time to 
put extra effort into teaching to maintain my students' confidence in our 
educational system. They have been very supportive of me in my desire to run 
for the board. Now, however, I think I may be most supportive of them by 
choosing not to divert any of my attention from teaching."

<P>
For the fourth consecutive year, Beverly Hills has been named "Tree City 
U.S.A." by the National Arbor Day Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills, famous for its abundance of tree species, was given the 
designation because it meets the four municipal tree-care standards established 
by the National Arbor Day Foundation: a legally constituted municipal tree 
organization, a city tree ordinance, a comprehensive community forestry program 
and observance of Arbor Day.

The city is studying a pilot project to provide day care for the frail elderly, 
AIDS patients and people with other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Other day care centers that provide health care are open to the frail elderly 
only. The West Hollywood center would be among the first to provide care for 
AIDS patients and adults with other disabilities, said Perri Sloane, the city's 
Senior Services Program specialist. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council agreed to contribute $75,000 to $100,000 to the project, 
contingent upon sufficient funding from outside sources. Sloane said the city 
is seeking state funding. The start-up cost, Sloane said, would be about 
$450,000.

CALL FOR ACTION ON POLICE SUBSTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Subsequent to your story on "Police to Add Substation, More Patrols in 
Palisades" (Times, Feb. 2), I chaired a meeting on the subject with Capt. 
Maurice Moore, West L.A. police subdivision head, and a number of interested 
community leaders. Moore advised the group that "no substation was planned; all 
that had happened was that the Chamber (of Commerce) would supply space with a 
telephone where the one-car patrol officers could file reports and telephone 
the Butler Avenue station." He also felt that using private security services 
hindered police deployment. 
</P>
<P>
Albeit Capt. Moore was knowledgeable about police services and limitations, it 
became obvious that we were speaking to the wrong person. The map unfurled 
showed his division responsible for an area of 64.5 square miles from La 
Cienega Boulevard west to Pacific Coast Highway, south to the Santa Monica city 
line, and north to the mountains. There has to be a change in boundaries as to 
what is the Westside. Response time, regardless of promises to do better, can't 
be lessened because of the distances. And to suggest that use of private 
security services "hinders police deployment" is a non sequitur. 
</P>
<P>
True, a substation is a cost item that would necessitate removing police 
officers from patrol (by car; not on foot as some believe), but overlooked is 
that a substation might be incorporated into mini-town halls that can serve the 
distinct neighborhoods in the Westside, such as the Palisades, with additional 
city services that now require citizens to travel either downtown or to the 
West L.A. City Hall. Such a facility, tied to parks, libraries, senior citizen 
centers, municipal courts, etc., would build the sense of community that is 
vital to citizen involvement and the pride to ensure that the neighborhood 
remains a place where one can live and enjoy life without some of the urban 
problems that frighten so many and endanger us all. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood concept can tie into the present City Council system. It 
merits discussion. And that's why I indicated earlier that we were addressing 
our needs to the wrong man. It's a matter for the mayor and the City Council. I 
have written to Tom Bradley and Marvin Braude. The Times may wish to explore 
the question as well.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Students throughout the Southland distinguished themselves in the first round 
of California's first Citizen Bee. 
</P>
<P>
On March 4, 234 students from 86 high schools in Southern California fielded 
questions about American government, history, geography, economics and current 
events in regional playoffs of the Citizen Bee. Participants had previously won 
contests at their schools. The nationwide civics competition is organized by 
the Close Up Foundation of Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
National Competition 
</P>
<P>
First-place winners in the 11 regional competitions will proceed to a statewide 
contest, which will be held April 22 in Los Angeles. The three top state 
winners will compete with other state winners in the national competition in 
June in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Top regional winners each took home a prize of $500. The state winner will win 
$1,000, plus a $2,500 scholarship. The three top finishers in the state will 
also receive all-expense-paid trips to Washington for the finals. The national 
winner will receive a $7,000 college scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
The national Citizen Bee was established in 1985 by the Close Up Foundation, a 
nonprofit organization that promotes civic education. In California, the 
contest is sponsored by the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>

DOGS NOT ALLOWED LOOSE ON BEACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Wendy Lamm photo and caption of a dog on the beach (Times, Feb. 9) imply 
that dogs are legally allowed on our beaches; they are not. As spring and 
summer approach, now is a good time to point out that loose dogs have become 
such a health and safety hazard on the beaches that lifeguards are empowered to 
order people and their dogs off the beach. A dog owner is liable for a $46 fine 
for a dog on the beach and another $46 fine if the dog is unleashed; this 
happened to an acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a petty issue, for the public's knowledge of health and safety 
guidelines is all for the common good. Unfortunately, from our home of 38 years 
on the Ocean Front Walk in Venice, my family has sadly witnessed, along with 
crass commercialism, a dispiriting decline in people's consideration for each 
other and our community. Nowadays, people tend to behave as advised by the 
song: "Don't worry, be happy." I suggest that each of us and our communities 
would be better served by less self-indulgence.

.. . AND THEIR DREAMS ARE GRANTED; 
</P>
<P>
TEACHERS WISH UPON A STAR . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Music teacher Cheryl Buck longed to feel the shiny brass and unstuck keys of a 
new saxophone. And she wished that her fourth- and fifth-grade students could 
hear the crisp sounds of a quality instrument. 
</P>
<P>
The high cost of band instruments, however, has made them prohibitive for the 
Laguna Beach Unified School District, which is in the same financial straits as 
other California schools. 
</P>
<P>
So Buck has been teaching music and band at Top of the World Elementary School 
on two saxophones in such bad shape that they have been declared surplus 
equipment. Other instruments also are in disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
But now, thanks to two Irvine developers who think teachers aren't sufficiently 
rewarded, Buck is getting her dream. Like two genies in a bottle, Al and Jim 
Baldwin asked teachers at Laguna Beach Unified to dream big dreams and to ask 
for something that they had always wanted but couldn't afford. The wish had to 
relate to teaching, but the reward would be for them, and not their students, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers then gave the school district $100,000 to be distributed over 5 
years and asked school officials to make some of those dreams come true. 
</P>
<P>
Nine teachers have been chosen as the recipients of the first Baldwin Scholar 
Grant Program, and they will use their prize money for everything from buying 
new instruments to traveling to Stratford-on-Avon to visit Shakespeare's 
birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fantastic program when they start giving money away with no strings 
attached," Buck said. "You can just let your mind be creative, come up with 
things you've always dreamed of having but never could afford, and now you can 
with the help of this grant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'To the Teachers' 
</P>
<P>
"You can indulge yourself," she said. "It doesn't have to go directly to the 
children. It goes to the teachers to broaden their horizons." 
</P>
<P>
The Baldwin brothers are partners in the Baldwin Co., a major development firm 
that has built homes throughout Orange County. Their grants have been 
incorporated into "School Power," the district's nonprofit, fund-raising group 
made up of parents. In the 3 years since its inception, School Power has raised 
$150,000 in donations toward an endowment program for the school. 
</P>
<P>
But the individual teacher grants were Al Baldwin's idea. He suggested that 
rewarding and motivating teachers eventually translates into a better education 
for children. 
</P>
<P>
"It enhances the general school system because it gets teachers who are 
enthusiastic about what they're doing," he said. "It shows that we care. We 
want to see enthusiastic teachers who are putting in an extra step. All these 
things are related, and it feeds back into what the students are learning." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Related to Their Work 
</P>
<P>
This year, 29 teachers applied for the grants, according to Supt. Dennis Smith, 
who said that the program is unique among school districts. The requirements 
were simple, he said: The teachers had to propose something that they had 
always wanted to do, that was related to their work but that they either could 
not personally afford or the district could not afford to do for them. 
</P>
<P>
They then had to submit a written proposal. Final selections were made by a 
committee composed of administrators, teachers and a member of School Power. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept it pretty wide open," Smith said. "We wanted to encourage the staff to 
continue to pursue excellence, to stay in teaching and to encourage creativity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like saying, 'Here's $5,000 -- what do you want to do with it?' " he 
said. "We told them, 'Think big, think creatively. You may never have this 
chance again.' " 
</P>
<P>
The cost of funding each winning proposal ranges from $2,500 to $5,000, he 
said. Some of the other proposals that were chosen include: 
</P>
<P>
* A trip to New York City for Rome Friesen, who teaches international relations 
at Laguna Beach High. For several years, Friesen has taken students to New York 
City on his own time for model U.N. conferences. This summer, Friesen plans to 
visit several United Nations missions when he goes on his Baldwin grant. 
</P>
<P>
* Two laser video disc systems for science and computer teachers Kathy Vick and 
Pam Mackay to enhance their lessons to third- and fourth-graders about the 
earth, life and physical science. 
</P>
<P>
* A computer-learning station for Deanna Walker, who wants to use it in her 
special education classroom at Top of the World Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
* Help with college costs for Heidi Lemon, an elementary school teacher who is 
working on her master's degree in education at National University. Lemon "is 
being rewarded for her quality of work and her dedication in wanting to stay in 
the classroom as she works toward her master's," school officials said in 
announcing the winners. 
</P>
<P>
* A trip to England for Terry Hustwick and Lois Rake, who developed the course 
"Shakespeare and His Times" at El Morro and Top of the World elementary 
schools, so that they can visit the Bard's birthplace at Stratford-on-Avon. 
They also will receive funds to bring Shakespearean actors, musicians and 
lecturers into their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
* A computer system and software for Laguna Beach High School band teacher Jeff 
Foster so he can write and arrange music for his marching band, as well as for 
himself. Presently, he writes marching band arrangements with hand-written 
diagrams. 
</P>
<P>
"It will have the capability of plugging a piano keyboard into it. . . . You 
plug it in, play a melody, and it will print the exact notes . . . on the 
printer. 
</P>
<P>
"It will bring me into the age of technology," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
He will also be able to print up programs for school concerts, he said, 
something that is done on a regular typewriter, and then photocopied. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a totally personal incentive, and sort of a reward, which is nice for 
people who work as hard as we all do," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
Buck owns only one instrument -- a clarinet. Now, she will be able to purchase 
a saxophone, trombone, flute and trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought of (proposing) a trip," she said. She had long dreamed of going to 
Europe to study the musical theories of Hungarian composer Zoltan Kodaly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Travel Abroad Delayed 
</P>
<P>
"But I decided that my first love is instrumental music, and I thought I should 
learn that the very best I can before I try to go overseas." 
</P>
<P>
She will use the instruments in demonstrations when she recruits students into 
the fourth- and fifth-grade band programs, she said. But they will be for her 
use only. 
</P>
<P>
"They're for me to practice on, not for the children to play," she said. "But 
they'll get to hear them. Year after year, they will be able to hear how a fine 
instrument sounds."

FOUNTAIN VALLEY MAN SHOT DEAD BY POLICE AT DOOR OF HIS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BEENE and KIMBERLY L. JACKSON, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Fountain Valley police officers responding to a woman's call for help on 
Wednesday shot and killed a man in a scuffle at the front door of his home, 
police and neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth time this year that police officers in Orange County have 
fired fatal shots in confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest incident, Harry Owen Clark, 53, suffered multiple gunshot wounds 
to the chest and arm after he apparently fought with two officers at the front 
door of his home in the 9300 block of Daisy Avenue, according to Fountain 
Valley Police Lt. Rod Gillman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Details Disclosed 
</P>
<P>
Gillman said Clark died at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center 
at 7:14 p.m., about two hours after being shot. The two officers involved in 
the shooting were not identified. 
</P>
<P>
Police disclosed few details of the shooting and said that, in accordance with 
department policy, it was being investigated by the Orange County district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
According to initial police reports, the officers first responded to a 
disturbance call at 4:07 p.m. at the Bushard Market, where a woman identified 
as Norma Clark explained that she had been involved in a bitter argument with 
Harry Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors in the quiet middle-class cluster of homes just off the San Diego 
Freeway said Harry Clark was Norma Clark's former brother-in-law, but that they 
had lived together on and off for the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Gillman said the officers escorted Norma Clark back to her beige, two-story 
tract home on Daisy Avenue, and "confirmed that the suspect was not there prior 
to leaving." 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, however, Gillman said the woman called from a neighbor's home to 
complain that Harry Clark "had returned and was trying to kick the door to her 
home down." 
</P>
<P>
Two uniformed Fountain Valley police officers returned and, according to one 
neighbor, approached the house with their guns drawn. 
</P>
<P>
Police said some kind of scuffle ensued at or near the front door and Harry 
Clark was shot. It was not clear just where Norma Clark was at the time of the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Gillman said he did not know if the victim was armed or how many times he was 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know they are still determining time of death, the number of 
wounds and that kind of thing," he said. "They have to look at the guns, check 
the deceased." 
</P>
<P>
Gillman said the shooting apparently took place "around the front door area, 
either just inside or just outside the door." 
</P>
<P>
First reports of the shooting indicated that one of the officers had suffered a 
broken arm in the fracas, but Gillman said X-rays at the hospital proved 
negative. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened, but I know that the officers were hit with some 
kind of object other than a fist" before the shooting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after the shooting, police officers and investigators from the district 
attorney's office remained at the house collecting evidence and taking 
pictures. Knots of neighbors stood outside the house in the street and talked 
about what they had heard in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Argument Heard 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor who lives down the street said several people had heard the Clarks 
arguing in the early afternoon, but that at 3:30 p.m., someone had seen Norma 
Clark at Bushard Market buying lottery tickets. 
</P>
<P>
James Sigmond, who lives directly across the street from the Clarks, said that 
shortly after the shooting, Norma Clark called him from an undetermined 
location and asked what had happened at her house, indicating that she was not 
home at the time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor, Richard Seymour, described Harry Clark as about 6 feet, 4 
inches tall, weighing about 250 pounds. He said he recognized Clark as the man 
on the stretcher, covered with bandages on his chest and arm, as he was taken 
from the house to an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents said Norma Clark had been divorced for more than 10 years and 
had lived off and on with her former brother-in-law. They said she had two 
children from her marriage -- a son in the Marine Corps and a daughter who no 
longer lives at home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earlier Shootings 
</P>
<P>
"They kept pretty much to themselves," Seymour said. "The only time either was 
here was to pick up their dog when it strayed in our yard." 
</P>
<P>
Clark's death was the fourth as a result of a police shooting in Orange County 
since the first of the year. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 29, Garden Grove police shot and killed a man who allegedly pointed a 
toy gun at them. Four days later, on Feb. 2, Anaheim police shot and killed an 
unarmed man outside an Anaheim motel room near Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 19, a 26-year-old man was killed by Huntington Beach police after he 
allegedly charged at two officers with martial arts weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The previous cases all are under investigation by the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gillman said the officers involved in Wednesday's shooting are on 
administrative leave, pending an internal investigation. Both will receive 
counseling, which is routinely given after officer-involved shootings.

LETTER THREATENS BERGESON WITH DEATH OVER GUN BAN 
</P>

An anonymous letter writer threatened last month to kill state Sen. Marian 
Bergeson if she supported legislation that would ban semiautomatic assault 
rifles, Bergeson said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach Republican, who voted Monday in committee for a bill to ban 
the weapons, said the threatening letter was postmarked Feb. 11 in Santa Ana 
and had a return address that read simply, "Huntington Beach, America." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson declined to quote from the letter but said the writer threatened to 
kill her if she voted to ban the guns. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they'd blow up my house," Bergeson added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sent to Investigators 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson said she forwarded the letter, which was received at her office here, 
to the state Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
At least one other lawmaker, Sen. Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino), has reported 
receiving a similar threat. Another, Sen. John Doolittle (R-Rocklin), a staunch 
defender of gun-owners' rights, has received what law enforcement authorities 
regarded as a threatening letter from an apparent supporter of gun control, a 
Doolittle spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), author of a bill to outlaw the 
weapons, has received "crank calls" on the gun control issue, according to 
Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Tony Beard. 
</P>
<P>
Beard also confirmed that the Senate has increased security measures for its 
committee hearings and floor sessions since attention was focused on the gun 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, Senate staff members 
inspected briefcases of spectators and witnesses, blocked doors normally used 
by the public and allowed entry into the room through only one door, which was 
equipped with metal detectors. Access to the Senate floor will also be 
restricted today when the full Senate is scheduled to consider the gun bill, 
Beard said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Taking Precautions' 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking precautions because this is an issue that people react 
emotionally to, and we're acting at the direction of the Rules Committee," 
Beard explained. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Sergeant-at-Arms Charles Bell could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson blamed the National Rifle Assn., which is fighting the proposed ban on 
semiautomatics, for using "intimidating tactics" that might have prompted the 
letter writer to threaten her life. 
</P>
<P>
"With the emotionalism they have stirred up as a result of the fervor with 
which they are opposing this measure, I think you bring all sorts of emotions 
to the surface," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Pam Pryor, an NRA spokeswoman, denied that the organization had done 
anything to prompt the death threats. She said the gun owners' group would 
"never condone" such an action. 
</P>
<P>
"If urging people to call and write their legislators is considered threatening 
nowadays, that's all we've done," she said. "We have not been hysterical. We 
have tried to be reasoned. I think the hysteria has been on the other side." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson, who said she has supported gun-owners' rights in the past, indicated 
that she sees the proposed ban on assault rifles as a "law-and-order issue." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's been misconstrued by people who think we are trying to take 
hunting rifles away," she said. "We are trying to prevent gang members and drug 
dealers from using these guns to indiscriminately slaughter children in our 
streets."

TRAVELERS QUIZZED ON AIRPORT AMENITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
If passengers at John Wayne Airport get their way, the typical fast-food nosh 
at the new passenger terminal in 1990 will consist of frozen yogurt, fruit, ice 
cream or popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
The merchandise offered at the gift shop will be upscale (read pricey), 
brand-name and of high quality. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers would also like to see a barbershop, a private membership lounge and 
that special county perk, valet parking. 
</P>
<P>
These were the findings when Miami-based Thompson Consultants International 
surveyed the tastes of 1,574 John Wayne travelers and of two special focus 
groups: travel agents and chamber of commerce officials. 
</P>
<P>
Although the survey was conducted in October, 1987, the results were not 
released by airport officials until this week, as they began evaluating dozens 
of bids submitted by vendors competing for valuable sales space in the new 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
The structure, part of a $310-million airport expansion program, is scheduled 
to open April 1, 1990. The affluence of John Wayne Airport patrons is a major 
draw for vendors, but finding the right mix of food, merchandise and services 
is an art, not a science, airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the survey of passengers' tastes indicated that alcoholic 
beverages are passe. But airport officials do not believe it for a minute. They 
still plan to install a cocktail lounge. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the market survey suggested a high degree of abstinence by travelers 
at John Wayne, which would suggest a low volume of liquor sales in the 
terminal, this is not considered reliable data," the Thompson firm wrote in a 
report to airport officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on experience with the population at large, at other airports and in the 
existing cocktail lounge at John Wayne . . . we have ignored the market survey 
results and estimate that alcohol will amount to one-third of total food and 
beverage sales at the airport." 
</P>
<P>
Gross annual sales for food and beverages at John Wayne are expected to top 
$8.4 million in the new terminal by 1994, according to the report. The county's 
projected share, based on a rental rate of 15% of gross sales, would be 
$1,230,800. 
</P>
<P>
Other findings: 
</P>
<P>
* About 20% of the passengers surveyed said they would often prefer fruit to 
other snacks; 19% would prefer frozen yogurt; 12%, ice cream, and 11%, popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
* The airport souvenir shop should offer "quality gifts or curios . . . due to 
the higher income brackets of passengers in the area." 
</P>
<P>
* About 56% of the travelers using the airport live or work in the county. 
</P>
<P>
* More than 61% are traveling on business. 
</P>
<P>
* Men who are married, 26 to 39 years old, with annual incomes of $40,000 to 
$74,000, account for 64% of the passengers. 
</P>
<P>
If you had hopes of playing video games, pinball or buying tobacco at the 
airport, forget it. County policies bar those activities. 
</P>
<P>
Services such as valet parking and a private lounge may be offered if further 
studies show that they are feasible. Typically, people react positively to such 
services in surveys but then do not use them as much as they say they will, the 
Thompson firm said. 
</P>
<P>
County staff members and officials of the Thompson firm have held talks with 
executives from Host/Marriott, Burger King, Carl Karcher Enterprises, 
McDonald's, Sbarro and other companies, most of whom have expressed interest in 
having concession space. So far, 14 firms have submitted bids, ranging from 
Creative Croissants to Jerry's Catering. 
</P>
<P>
A list of preferred food vendors recommended by a county-appointed committee 
reviewing the bids is scheduled to be considered by the County Airport 
Commission by March 21.

<P>
"If Life Is a Rainbow" 
</P>
<P>
STEPHANIE CHEUNG 
</P>
<P>
At 13, Stephanie Cheung has already adopted the frustrated jargon of writers 
twice her age. But she has managed to beat "writer's block" often enough to be 
selected as one of 104 promising young writers in a competition among 12,000 
first- through eighth-graders nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Cheung and 9-year-old Bethany Martin, named for the second successive year, 
were Orange County winners in the fifth annual national competition of the 
Young Writers Contest Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel happy," Martin said Tuesday. The fourth-grader, who won this year for 
her short story entitled "A Gift of Time," said she entered the contest again 
because she "thought it would be fun and a good experience for me because I 
like to write." 
</P>
<P>
Martin attends Arnold Elementary school in Cypress and said she has been 
writing "for a long, long time." She estimated that she has created about 200 
stories in her brief career. 
</P>
<P>
Cheung, whose poem "If Life Is a Rainbow" won her recognition, also writes 
short stories. Her work explores a variety of genres, including science 
fiction, fairy tales and mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
Cheung said some of her stories are stuffed, unfinished, in a desk drawer. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes when I get an idea, I start writing and I can't stop." But other 
times, when she gets a writer's block, she just puts the work aside, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The stories she has finished include an engaging children's tale about a 
country where chocolate is illegal to a Stephen King-like thriller about a 
living-dead man whose raspy laughter can still be heard though he has been 
buried in a wooden trunk with an ax plunged into his neck. 
</P>
<P>
Cheung's father, Stephen, an engineer at a Pasadena firm, said he and his wife, 
Rebecca, an accountant, have only read one or two of their daughter's stories. 
</P>
<P>
"She is so shy," Stephen Cheung explained, "she doesn't want us to read them." 
</P>
<P>
But those he has read were "very creative," showing great imagination, he said. 
Cheung remembered the stories he would create for her at bedtime. "Maybe that's 
why she has that kind of imagination," he said, exuding 
</P>
<P>
fatherly pride. 
</P>
<P>
Cheung said her brother Kevin, 12, is her toughest critic: "He hates everything 
I write." 
</P>
<P>
In her winning poem, Cheung, motivated by depression and loneliness she felt 
after changing schools this year, is symbolically separated from the love, joy 
and serenity "that make this world worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, both Cheung, an eighth-grader at South Junior High School in 
Anaheim, and Martin named science as their favorite subject. Both want to be 
scientists when they grow up. Each has written stories reflecting that 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
Martin's winning story is about a girl who agrees to help an injured cat from a 
different time period find his way home. 
</P>
<P>
"I started to make up little stories in my head," she said of her early 
creations. Martin said she has always loved reading and was inspired by 
favorites like Ann M. Martin, who is not related. "I guess I just got the idea 
that I could read my own writing," she said. "I guess I just got the idea that 
I'd like to see my own stories in a store." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Lot Younger Then' 
</P>
<P>
Martin said her ideas have come from dreams, books and social problems. And a 
few stories, like last year's winner called "Meg and the Week of Despair," were 
based in part on personal experiences, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want it to be known that I was a lot younger then and that I've 
changed," Martin said, referring to the autobiographical portions of her story 
about a girl who was punished after she threw a temper tantrum when she could 
not have a toy. "Now I just say, 'OK, maybe next time.' " 
</P>
<P>
The contest, begun in 1984, is designed to encourage youngsters to write well 
by recognizing their work and rewarding them with publication at an early age, 
according to Kathie Janger, 49, founder and executive director of the nonprofit 
Young Writers Contest Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to figure out what we could do to combat future adult 
illiteracy," Janger said. She explained that the thrust of the contest is to 
make youngsters realize that writing is important by publishing the annual 
winners in a book called "Rainbow Collection: Stories and Poetry by Young 
People." Publicity also helps, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we make it important by putting (the winners) into the newspapers, it 
spills over into the minds of the kids and they think, 'Hey, this is 
important.' "

PARENTS BLAST PLAN TO CUT FREE BUSING; 
</P>
<P>
VOW TO FIGHT SCHOOL BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of parents, angered by proposals that would cut back on free school 
busing and force their children to walk several miles to school, are banding 
together to try to stop the Saddleback Valley Unified School District board 
from implementing the plan. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen parents confronted board members at their meeting Tuesday night 
with concerns about safety and finding alternative transportation for their 
children. They convinced the board to postpone cutbacks in bus service for the 
current school year. 
</P>
<P>
But now their goal is to halt the board from deciding on April 4 to increase 
the minimum walking distance for students next fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to form a coalition to gain some community support and look into 
ways to make them (the board) listen to what we're saying and take our concerns 
into account," Betsy Arnow of El Toro said. 
</P>
<P>
Arnow said the group is hoping to get legal advice next week on how to get an 
injunction to stop any bus service cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Parents complained that they waited about 2 1/2 hours to address the board and 
that board members appeared to have already decided to go ahead with their 
cutback plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd be able to voice my opinion and have a chance to be heard, but 
it seems to me that you had no intention of listening to anything we have to 
say," Kathleen Sandhaus of Laguna Hills told board members. 
</P>
<P>
Several parents claimed that the board gave only a few days' notice about 
public hearings held last week to inform parents of the changes. 
</P>
<P>
Arnow said that at a public hearing March 2 an administrator in charge of 
transportation said the district did not have time to circulate information 
regarding which bus stops would be affected by cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"You say that you want to have extensive communication with the community," El 
Toro resident Len Nawrocki told the board. "But how can you do that if you 
haven't told half of the community about it?" 
</P>
<P>
Board member R. Kent Hann told parents that the board carefully looked into the 
bus service and had "taken a firm line on the busing issue. . . . Our 
preference is that school isn't taught in the buses but in the classroom. And 
it has always been our policy not to take money from educational services to 
put into busing." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, what's the purpose of having classrooms and educational programs if you 
won't have any kids attending them because they can't get to school?" Linda 
Mangold of Portola Hills snapped back. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the students affected by the board's plan are ninth- to 12th-graders 
who would have to find alternative transportation to class if they live 3.5 
miles or less from their schools. However, the minimum walking distance for all 
students would be raised. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents said the district is responsible for providing transportation for 
their children, who would be walking along unlit streets or major roads to get 
to school. And the parents said the district should provide bus service at any 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
"If we got the extra money on transportation, we'd spend it on transportation, 
but the state is not giving us any extra money, so where are we going to get 
the money from for this?" board member Dore J. Gilbert said. "As long as we 
have shrinking funds there's no way we as a district will take money out of our 
classrooms to pay for busing." 
</P>
<P>
The district charged $135 per student for bus service to and from school for 5 
years. But last December a state directive barred school districts from 
charging fees for bus service after an appellate court ruled that they are 
unconstitutional. The district is expected to lose about $600,000 in parent 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
"All I hear is we don't have the money for a $600,000 deficit which represents 
only seven-tenths of a budget," Nawrocki told the board. ". . . I think the 
safety of our children is . . . more important than seven-tenths of a budget."

BARRICADED WOMAN, 19, FOUND DEAD IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine police Wednesday sealed off a three-block area and evacuated 10 
residences while dispatching a special negotiating team in an attempt to get a 
young woman who had barricaded herself in her home to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
But when police finally entered the Rossano Street home of Crista Barrow, 19, 
they found the woman fatally wounded, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot 
wound to the head. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began at about 3 p.m. when police entered into a 2-hour 
negotiating session with the distraught young woman. Officers set up an 
evacuation center at a nearby park for residents whose homes were near the 
barricaded house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shot Once in Temple 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Police Lt. Mike White said Barrow shot herself once in the temple with a 
.32-caliber pistol about 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
She died about 4 hours later at UCI Medical Center in Orange, according to a 
hospital official. 
</P>
<P>
White said police earlier had received an urgent call from a woman representing 
Barrow's psychologist. She warned officers that Barrow had a gun and was very 
upset. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the incident began, White said, Barrow fired one shot into a wall 
of the house on the quiet residential street. Then, 2 hours into the standoff, 
police heard a second shot and rushed through the front door. She was found 
unconscious on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics treating Barrow took her by helicopter to the medical center. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, she was upset over some kind of drug problem and was extremely 
agitated when our officers arrived. She told one of the officers that she had a 
gun and was going to commit suicide," White said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slammed Door 
</P>
<P>
Barrow then showed one of the officers the gun and slammed the door in the 
officer's face, White added. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, we backed off and called in our negotiation team," White said. 
</P>
<P>
Police negotiators talked with Barrow through a window, attempting to get her 
to surrender, but she refused all attempts, according to White. 
</P>
<P>
Police set up the evacuation center at Norwood Community Park, about 4 blocks 
away. But park recreation leaders said none of the residents opted to use the 
facility.

<P>
Allegany Community College is a haven for basketball players whose ascent to 
Division I stardom is delayed by a deficient Scholastic Aptitude Test score or 
grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Allegany College was made for Jay Bias. 
</P>
<P>
It puts him in a prosperous basketball program whose no-nonsense coach places 
as much emphasis on going to class as on burying a jump shot. It removes him 
from the distractions and pressures that dogged him in high school, when he was 
trying to be himself but people wouldn't let him. 
</P>
<P>
"I study, play basketball and go to high school games," Bias said. "It's like 
I'm on vacation." 
</P>
<P>
The brother of Len Bias, the former Maryland star who died of cocaine 
intoxication in 1986 two days after the Boston Celtics had selected him in the 
first round of the National Basketball Association draft, Jay was talking the 
other day in an office in Allegany's athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
"I idolized my brother," Jay Bias said. "He's still my idol." 
</P>
<P>
An Allegany freshman who has grown two inches, to 6-foot-7, since last summer, 
Bias averaged more than 17 points a game as the Trojans finished No. 8 in the 
final National Junior College Athletic Association poll. 
</P>
<P>
However, Allegany was denied a fifth consecutive trip to the NJCAA National 
Tournament in Hutchinson, Kan., when it lost to Hagerstown, 87-86, in a 
regional tournament last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Bias will wrestle with whether he should return for his second year at 
Allegany and then transfer to a Division I school, or transfer now and sit out 
the mandatory year, leaving him with three more years of eligibility? 
</P>
<P>
"The door is open," Bias said. "I'm going to sit down and discuss it with 
Coach." 
</P>
<P>
Allegany Coach Bob Kirk says major Division I basketball schools are wooing 
Bias, including one from the Big East that wants Bias and teammate Antoine 
Jones as a package. Jones also is a freshman, but Kirk insists it isn't 
frustrating to lose a player after one year. 
</P>
<P>
"They come here to get a better opportunity," Kirk said. "If they get an offer 
that satisfies them, they should go. I'm not going to stand in the way of a kid 
who has a chance to play three years instead of two at the Division I level 
before crowds of 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Jay is a great athlete. He shoots really well, and it's surprising how much he 
has improved this year on defense and rebounding. He's a major player, a 
big-time player. He could start for a lot of Division I schools now." 
</P>
<P>
One thing is certain: Bias will not go to Maryland. It is not that he holds the 
university responsible for his brother's death. But the pressure, as the 
brother of Len Bias, would be stifling. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't see myself going to Maryland," Bias said. "Too much pressure on 
myself and my family. People would expect me to do things my brother did." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Jay was a blossoming player at Northwestern High in Prince George's 
County, Md. He would go on to average 20 points as a junior, leading 
Northwestern to the Maryland Class AA championship. As a senior he averaged 26 
points, but he fell short of the 700 SAT score required by the NCAA's 
Proposition 48. 
</P>
<P>
"When my brother died, I got a chip on my shoulder," Bias said. "Nothing worse 
could happen. Since he was gone, I saw no reason to do what I was supposed to 
do. My attitude was, 'forget the world.' 
</P>
<P>
"I found myself doing things I shouldn't have. I wouldn't do my schoolwork. 
Instead, I'd hang out -- at clubs, with friends. My mother and friends 
counseled me. I straightened up." 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Lonise, had by then started to lecture all over the country, and as 
far away as Brazil, on self-destruction, including drugs, alcohol and violence. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since my brother died, her goal has been to help young people avoid what 
happened to him," Bias said. 
</P>
<P>
Two dozen schools recruited Bias. Because he didn't meet Proposition 48 
requirements, he would have been forced to sit out his first year at a 
four-year school. Bias wanted to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I love basketball," he said. "It's my food. I have to have it." 
</P>
<P>
It's like I'm an addict." 
</P>
<P>
Kirk knew about Bias because he had recruited another Northwestern player, 
Clint Venable, now an Allegany sophomore, the year before. 
</P>
<P>
"We low-keyed it," Kirk said. "We simply told him we were interested." 
</P>
<P>
Majoring in telecommunications, Bias earned a 2.9 grade-point average the first 
semester. Kirk says he was impressed on a recent road trip when he glanced at a 
20-minute newscast Bias rewrote from a newspaper, as instructed, on national 
and local news, sports and weather.

JIM MURRAY: HE DESERVES THANKS FOR THE MEMORY

VERO BEACH, Fla. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The pitch was right where it had to be. Two more inches outside and it's Ball 
4. Six inches inside and Kirk Gibson fouls it off again. Pops it up. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it was a pitch that made the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
It was no surprise to the batter. Gibson knew it was coming all the way. He 
wasn't really muscled up to hit it out of the park, just out of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances were these: The World Series, it so happened, was on the 
line. Not everyone knew it at the time because it was only Game 1, but it was 
the ninth inning, and the Dodgers trailed, 4-3, with two out. 
</P>
<P>
No one knew history was in the making as Kirk Gibson limped up to the plate. No 
one knew a home run for the ages was about to be hit. Else, why did Mike Davis, 
who walked with two out, steal second base? I mean, would you steal second with 
Babe Ruth coming up? What if you get thrown out? There goes the World Series. 
There goes baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson came out of the Dodger dugout like a guy who had just got hit by a 
truck. He didn't walk, he hobbled. 
</P>
<P>
History is not made, it just happens. You have to wonder, what if Charlie Root 
had walked Babe Ruth the day he called his shot in the World Series in 1932? 
And what if Dennis Eckersley had bounced a 3-2 curve to Gibson in the World 
Series in 1988? 
</P>
<P>
No one knows if Babe Ruth knew what was coming that day in Chicago so long ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Kirk Gibson knew exactly what was coming in Game 1 in 1988. Because in the 
pre-Series scouting session with the club, scout Mel Didier laid it on the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure as I'm standing here breathing, if it's the ninth inning and the count is 
3-2, you're going to see a back-door slider from Dennis Eckersley," he warned. 
"Make book on it. Don't look for anything else." 
</P>
<P>
A back-door slider is a cross between a fastball and a curveball. It looks like 
a fastball till it swerves like a breaking ball. It's a home run pitch. It's a 
batting practice pitch -- if you know it's coming. Otherwise, it's called 
Strike 3. 
</P>
<P>
That's what it would have been in Gibson's case. The back-door nomenclature 
comes from the fact that the pitch is delivered to the outside of the plate to 
a left-handed batter. It looks all the way like Ball 4. Only Gibson knew that 
at the last fraction, the ball would dip over the plate and down into the 
strike zone. He put that pitch into the right-field seats -- and, no doubt, 
into Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few home runs make the Hall of Fame. Ruth's called shot in '32. Bobby 
Thomson's three-run "little miracle of Coogan's Bluff" in the ninth in 1951. 
Henry Aaron's 715th. 
</P>
<P>
And Kirk Gibson's in Dodger Stadium in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Because that home run effectively won the World Series. It's not impossible to 
think that the Oakland Athletics suddenly began to look like a lot of guys 
trapped in a haunted house after that one swing. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, they had given all the appearances of being an almost 
overconfident bunch. They had just slammed down the dangerous Boston Red Sox in 
four straight. The Dodgers weren't even supposed to be in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Canseco had done what he's supposed to do in the World Series -- hit a 
grand slam. The A's had the best relief pitcher in the universe on the mound. 
They had a guy at bat who looked as if he'd just left his wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
And, all of a sudden, the ball is in the right-field seats. The game is over. 
Oakland is hearing voices. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson's home run is one for the ages. But it wouldn't have been had Oakland 
come back to sweep the Series. It would have been just an interesting incident. 
Now, it becomes one of the great dramatic turning points of baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
It was a home run the minute it left the bat. The only suspense was how far up 
in the bleachers it would land. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson recalls that he wasn't able to put the real Gibson 360-degree home run 
swing on it. He didn't have to. If he had been able to, the ball might not have 
come down yet. As it was, it was no foul-line shot. It was a rainmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson never got another at-bat in the Series. He didn't need one. Gibson 
batted 1.000 for the '88 World Series. In fact, he batted a million. It's 
probably what that hit was worth to the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson has now hit seven home runs in postseason play. If Reggie Jackson 
is Mr. October, Kirk Gibson is at least hey-what-about-me? 
</P>
<P>
He hit two home runs in one game in the 1984 World Series. The second one put 
that Series away. 
</P>
<P>
"There were men on second and third, first base was open and the expectation 
was that (San Diego Padres relief pitcher) Goose Gossage would walk me," he 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember (Manager) Sparky Anderson was holding up four fingers to me, 
indicating they were going to walk me. I shook my head. I knew Gossage would 
try to strike me out. I held up 10 fingers and shook them at Sparky, meaning I 
bet 10 dollars Gossage would pitch to me. Sparky said, 'You got a bet!' 
</P>
<P>
"(San Diego Manager) Dick Williams came out to the mound. I could almost hear 
Gossage mouthing to him, 'Hey! I've always had pretty good luck pitching to 
this guy. Let me get him out. I can strike him out.' 
</P>
<P>
"The first pitch was a ball. The second was what I knew it would be. A Gossage 
fastball up and in." 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson hit it into the second deck. That World Series was over, too. 
</P>
<P>
The moral of the story is, never throw Kirk Gibson a strike with a game, or a 
Series on the line. Particularly if he's expecting it. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, these are the little mistakes that make baseball what it is, 
endlessly fascinating to rehash, relive. The game that brought the hot stove 
league to sports. 
</P>
<P>
To err is not only human, it's baseball. Pitchers get E-1 if they throw wildly 
or to a wrong base. They should get one for throwing accurately to the plate 
with Gibson and a Series on the line. But of such foibles is the game made 
great. 
</P>
<P>
What if Charlie Root had hit Babe Ruth in the fat of the back instead of the 
fat of the bat? Suppose Ralph Branca had thrown Bobby Thomson a changeup? What 
if Dennis Eckersley had thrown a back-door Ball 4 that never broke over the 
plate, instead of a slider that did? 
</P>
<P>
If he had, the 500,000 or so people who say they saw Gibson's home run from the 
seats would admit they missed the game altogether. Instead of being a home run 
for Cooperstown, it would have been, if Oakland had gone on to win the Series, 
just another run batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson has the ball. He ought at least write, "Thanks, Mel!" on it for Didier. 
And for all baseball.

SEAN ELLIOTT KEEPS DRAWING RAVE REVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beads of sweat drip from Arizona All-American forward Sean Elliott as he towels 
off after a grueling practice. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin O'Neill, an Arizona assistant coach, sits down next to Elliott and puts 
his arm around the player. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill kisses Elliott's head. 
</P>
<P>
"Sean is a sweet, sweet kid," says O'Neill, who named his own son after 
Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
Other college basketball coaches and scouts apparently like Elliott almost as 
much as O'Neill does. 
</P>
<P>
"I love Elliott," said former coach Dick Vitale, the volatile commentator for 
ABC and ESPN. "I just think from a coach's standpoint, he's absolutely a great 
player. He's every adjective you can use." 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-8 senior, Elliott is expected to go high in the National Basketball 
Assn. draft in June. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said Elliott could become the first Pacific 10 player to 
be selected No. 1 in the draft since Bill Walton, a former Bruin, who was 
chosen first by the Portland Trail Blazers in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Elliott is the No. 1 draft choice in America," Harrick said. "If I 
were starting a pro team, he's the first guy I'd pick." 
</P>
<P>
Marty Blake, NBA scouting director, ranks Elliott among the nation's top 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Elliott and Danny Ferry (Duke forward) will go 1-2 and don't let 
anybody tell you any different," Blake said. "Elliott and Ferry have the talent 
to play right away." 
</P>
<P>
Said Paul Evans, Pittsburgh coach: "I think Elliott's a tremendous player. In 
fact, he got my vote for player of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Tarkanian, Nevada Las Vegas coach, said of Elliott, who had 32 points and 
15 rebounds against UNLV: "I think he's a phenomenal player. I'm a big fan of 
his. He's one of the best college players I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
So why all the raves? 
</P>
<P>
Simple. Elliott has had an extraordinary season, averaging 21.8 points, 7.4 
rebounds and 4.2 assists for top-ranked Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
THE PRICE OF FAME 
</P>
<P>
Sean Elliott closed his eyes, letting the warm water fall on his tired body. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott had been battered in the Wildcats' season-ending victory over UCLA and 
he was unwinding in a deserted shower. 
</P>
<P>
Or so he thought. 
</P>
<P>
As he reached for the soap, he suddenly discovered that he had company. 
</P>
<P>
A radio reporter had joined Elliott in the shower area and was sticking a 
microphone in his face. 
</P>
<P>
The intrusion startled Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the first time that's happened," Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
An Arizona official quickly hustled the reporter out of the locker room, but 
only after the reporter had threatened to fight. 
</P>
<P>
It was a bizarre scene and if the price of fame is losing the last vestige of 
privacy, Elliott apparently has paid the price. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, Sean was a deity but this year he's a god," said Harvey Mason, 
junior guard. "You can't get much higher than Sean in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
In Tucson, where Elliott is top Wildcat, he stirs a commotion wherever he goes. 
</P>
<P>
"When I go to a shopping mall, people don't understand that I don't want to 
sign autographs for an hour and a half," Elliott said. "If I don't sign, they 
think I'm rude." 
</P>
<P>
Even his mother has become a celebrity. Odiemae Elliott signs almost as many 
autographs as Sean. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, though, works hard on his image. He usually has four or five speaking 
engagements a week, talking about the evils of drugs to schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
And he apparently has handled his acclaim well. His teammates say that Elliott 
is just a regular guy. 
</P>
<P>
"Sean has never been egotistical," said Jud Buechler, junior forward. "He has 
one of the best personalities of anyone I've ever met. He could easily be 
pompous because it's so obvious that he's in another league. But Sean treats 
you like a normal guy." 
</P>
<P>
Off the court, Elliott is the team comedian. He keeps the players loose with 
his jokes. 
</P>
<P>
"We call him Silly because Sean is silly most of the time," said Anthony Cook, 
the senior center who shared an apartment with Elliott for three years. "People 
look at him and think he's shy, but when he's around the fellows, he's a 
different person." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott loves to play practical jokes. 
</P>
<P>
On O'Neill's birthday, for instance, Elliott threw a pie in the assistant 
coach's face -- in front of 450 people who were attending a basketball class 
being taught by O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill got even on Elliott's 21st birthday last month, when he hit Elliott 
with a pie after a game. 
</P>
<P>
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar may not know who Elliott is -- at least that's what he said 
-- but most of Arizona certainly does. 
</P>
<P>
The Arizona Daily Star published an eight-page special section on Elliott after 
he broke Abdul-Jabbar's Pac-10 scoring record last month. 
</P>
<P>
"In Tucson, it gets real hectic," Elliott said. "Sometimes it gets downright 
out of control. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard that it's going to be worse when I get to the NBA, but I'm real 
sure it's not going to be as bad as it is now. Tucson is a fishbowl. Everything 
you do is observed by people. Everyone knows who you are. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to be a normal person. People say that being famous must be fun, but 
now that I've tasted both sides, I think there are advantages, but there are 
lot of disadvantages as well." 
</P>
<P>
When Elliott feels the world tugging at him, he escapes to his apartment, his 
sanctuary. He takes the phone off the hook and spends time alone. 
</P>
<P>
SEAN THE MAGNIFICENT 
</P>
<P>
Sean Elliott was trapped by two defenders in the backcourt. He whirled and 
threw a full-court pass to set up teammate Anthony Cook for an easy dunk. 
</P>
<P>
On Arizona's next possession, Elliott pulled up at the three-point arc and 
launched a shot that floated through the net. 
</P>
<P>
After taking a pass, Elliott drove the baseline and glided to the basket for a 
dunk. 
</P>
<P>
With the game in question, Elliott stepped to the free-throw line and calmly 
made two free throws, sealing the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott's versatility has enabled him to become perhaps the nation's best 
college basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
"Elliott's an excellent basketball player," said Ralph Miller, Oregon State's 
coach. "He has no weaknesses. I think the secret to his success is being 
versatile. He's an excellent shooter and ballhandler and he's thoroughly 
indoctrinated in the team concept. What more do you need?" 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
What does Elliott do best? 
</P>
<P>
"The thing Elliott does best is everything," said Billy Tubbs, Oklahoma's 
coach. "He puts the ball on the floor well. He passes the ball. He shoots well. 
He's a great athlete. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he has a flaw, but you'd have to ask (Arizona Coach) Lute Olson 
because I haven't seen any of them." 
</P>
<P>
Olson hasn't, either. He said that Elliott is as versatile as Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
So what motivates Elliott to excel? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid of failure," he said. "Once I got to a level where people started 
recognizing me, I didn't want to fall from that level. A lot of athletes get on 
the cover of Sports Illustrated and that's the end of that. They don't produce 
the way they're supposed to. I didn't want that to happen to me." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, that doesn't seem likely.

WOMEN'S TENNIS TOURNAMENT AT INDIAN WELLS; 
</P>
<P>
MANDLIKOVA UPSETS EVERT IN THREE SETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
INDIAN WELLS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In women's tennis, some things are guaranteed. They are accepted as such 
indisputable truths that, when mentioned, rows of heads nod in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Truth is: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Steffi Graf hitting a forehand winner from anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gabriela Sabatini hitting a looping forehand shot with topspin at the 
baseline. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chris Evert winning at match point. 
</P>
<P>
But truth took a beating here Wednesday under a relentless hot sun at Hyatt 
Grand Champions, where Evert had match point against Hana Mandlikova, then 
wound up losing in the second round of the Virginia Slims of Indian Wells, 3-6, 
7-6, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
For Evert, it was like discovering that everything she knew was wrong. The last 
time Evert held match point and lost? Try 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Evert reacted typically. "I could kick myself," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mandlikova had already managed to do that, putting together one of her patented 
performances -- alternating currents of brilliance and boo-boos. 
</P>
<P>
There was no doubt that Evert, who had a first-round bye, had drawn a difficult 
opponent for her first match. There was also no doubt that Evert would win when 
she was at match point, serving at 5-4 in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
However, at 40-30, Evert committed the most costly of all her unforced errors 
by hitting a backhand wide. Mandlikova gained the advantage with a backhand 
volley winner, then broke serve on the next point when Evert missed yet again 
with her backhand. 
</P>
<P>
Once they got to the tiebreaker, Mandlikova was in control. But she said she 
usually feels this way about tiebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I own them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Evert could scarcely rent a point. Mandlikova took a 4-0 lead and coasted in, 
7-2. 
</P>
<P>
It got worse for Evert in the third set, which was littered with three more 
service breaks and two of her four foot faults. 
</P>
<P>
So, after one match, the top-seeded player is no longer around. Evert took her 
defeat with grace, but she did not go quietly. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one match I'll think about for a while," she said. "There aren't many 
matches where I have match point and lose. 
</P>
<P>
"Once (Mandlikova) was back in the match, she got confidence and played great. 
I really should never have let her back in the match." 
</P>
<P>
Evert, 34, was playing only her third match -- her second tournament of the 
year, actually -- since the Virginia Slims Championships last November. Evert 
thought her lack of match play had hurt her, perhaps as much as Mandlikova had. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my second tournament in three months and that was my choice," Evert said. 
"I'm paying the consequences right now." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, a match between Evert and Mandlikova would have made a pretty 
good semifinal. Actually, three years ago it was exactly that. They met in the 
semifinals on the clay at the French Open and on the grass at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
But when they met on the hard court on a sunny Wednesday, they were playing 
only a second-round match, the result of a draw that paired the top-seeded 
Evert against the unseeded Mandlikova. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing me in the second round is very, very tough," said a modest Mandlikova, 
who extended her record in three-set matches this year to 9-0. 
</P>
<P>
Now five tournaments into her comeback after a six-month absence from the tour, 
Mandlikova's ranking of No. 51 could improve to No. 20 or better if she wins 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Estep, Mandlikova's coach, said her ranking will improve soon, regardless. 
"But she's close to a top-10 player right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Evert said that Mandlikova looks pretty much the same to her, comeback or not, 
then gave Mandlikova sort of a two-fisted backhand compliment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she's still the same player," Evert said. "She still makes errors. She 
still gives opponents free points, but she can still look spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
Except for playing a tournament at Tokyo in the first week of February, Evert 
has spent most of her time at Aspen, Colo., with skier-husband Andy Mill, who 
is busy during winter. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm not the greatest player after a layoff, but I should have won the 
match," Evert said. "If you have match point, you should win it. It's as simple 
as that." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tennis historians will note that the last time Chris Evert lost when she had 
match point was in the final of the 1975 Virginia Slims of Washington against 
Martina Navratilova. Oddly, it was match point for both players at 4-4 in the 
third-set tiebreaker. At that time, the nine-point tiebreakers did not have to 
be won by two points. . . . In Tuesday's other match-point highlight, Gretchen 
Magers held match point against fourth-seeded Manuela Maleeva and wound up 
losing, 2-6, 7-5, 6-2. . . . Unseeded Terry Phelps upset fifth-seeded Lori 
McNeil, 6-1, 6-2. "If I had lost, no one would have thought much about it," 
Phelps said. "But I just didn't make any errors." . . . Helena Sukova, seeded 
second, had no trouble defeating Brenda Schultz, 6-3, 6-4, in a match that was 
not the best of the day, but was tops among the tall set. Sukova is 6 feet 2 
inches, Schultz 6-1.

NEWSWIRE: KINGDOM TIES FOSTER'S WORLD INDOOR RECORD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Roger Kingdom tied the world indoor record for the 60-meter hurdles with a time 
of 7.36 seconds Wednesday in a meet at Piraeus, Greece. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Foster had the same time in a 1987 meet at the Sports Arena, but there was 
some controversy about the validity of the record. Some athletes and officials 
contended that Foster and others in the race jumped the gun. 
</P>
<P>
"With this race, I made the time official in the eyes of the IAAF 
(International Amateur Athletic Federation)," Kingdom said. "(Foster) 
false-started. 
</P>
<P>
"I was one of the people in the race behind him and I false-started, so truly I 
believe in my heart that I have the world record." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Pierce and Arthur Blake finished second and third with times of 7.63 and 
7.65, respectively.

Ronnie Harmon testified that his education at the University of Iowa was not a 
joke, as an attorney in the fraud trial of two sports agents questioned the 
running back on why he was allowed to play football despite failing grades. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon, the government's first witness in the trial of Norby Walters and Lloyd 
Bloom in Chicago, acknowledged that he was put on academic probation at the end 
of his junior year and took a summer course in water-color painting, for which 
he got a D. 
</P>
<P>
But Harmon, now with the Buffalo Bills, and Iowa officials said his grades 
never left him ineligible for football. And the officials said that Harmon was 
given no special treatment.

Forward Rod Higgins hit a trio of three-point goals, and Chris Mullin and Mitch 
Richmond scored 12 points apiece in a 50-point fourth quarter to lead the 
Golden State Warriors to a 138-112 victory over the Clippers Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors trailed, 89-88, going into the final quarter, but Golden State ran 
up its second-highest quarter total in franchise history to break open the game 
inasmuch as the Clippers managed only 23 points during the same span. The 
Warriors scored on 23 consecutive possessions during their hot fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the 13th in a row for the Clippers, who have also dropped 32 of 
their last 33 games and are 2-33 on the road this season. 
</P>
<P>
Mullin led the Warrior attack with 31 points, and Richmond added 28. Higgins 
scored 15 points in less than one half of play. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Ken Norman of the Clippers had a career-high 38 points to lead all 
scorers. Guard Quintin Dailey, moved back into a starting role, added 21 
points. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers came out firing with Norman's 11 points helping Los Angeles build 
a 35-26 lead after the first quarter. Golden State fought back to tie the 
score, 59-59, at the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers held a 98-94 lead with 8:50 to play, and the score was tied, 
98-98, with 8:20 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State then exploded for a 20-6 run with Higgins hitting three 
three-pointers without a miss and Mullin and Richmond repeatedly scoring on 
fast-break layins.

THOMAS HELPS KEEP DETROIT ON TARGET IN DEFEATING SEATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Isiah Thomas has had time to work on his shooting touch lately and he is 
leading the Detroit Pistons' late drive to overtake Cleveland in the Central 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas made a three-point shot 14 seconds into the game at Auburn Hills, Mich., 
Wednesday night to start the Pistons on the way to their fifth consecutive 
victory, a 112-96 beating of the Seattle SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who scored 27 points, triggered a 9-0 run in the fourth quarter with a 
three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons, 24-2 when they hold the opposition to fewer than 100 points, are 2 
1/2 games behind the Cavaliers, who have led the division most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
With the Cavaliers scheduled to play five more games on their trip West, the 
Pistons are hoping to gain ground in the next week. 
</P>
<P>
"We have spent most of the last 10 days at home, and I have had a chance to 
work on my shot," Thomas said after going 12 for 21. "I now have good mechanics 
and good rotation. Now is the time to work on things you can utilize in the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
The tough Detroit defense held the SuperSonics to 39% shooting. Seattle, which 
trailed by 21 points at halftime, trailed by only 10 with 10 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' three-point play and the Pistons' strong rebounding ended the threat. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit outrebounded Seatlle, 55-43. 
</P>
<P>
"We take pride in our defense," forward Rick Mahorn said. "We worked on our 
trapping defense in practice yesterday. We also were ready to rebound, knowing 
that Seattle is the league's best offensive rebounding team." 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the SuperSonics 4 1/2 games behind the Lakers in the Pacific 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 117, Houston 80 -- It was supposed to be a showdown between the leaders of 
the Midwest Division at Salt Lake City, but the Rockets forgot to bring their 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Akeem Olajuwon scored 22 points, but the Rockets, falling four games behind the 
Jazz, had their lowest point total of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Karl Malone scored 29 points, and John Stockton had 18 points and 17 
assists to lead the Jazz to their third consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 119, Atlanta 111 -- Bullet fans aren't sure whether they want their 
team to reach the playoffs or qualify for the bonus selection in the draft. But 
they seem to be enjoying the club's recent surge. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Kings scored 23 of his 31 points in the second half at Landover, Md., 
to lead the Bullets to their fifth victory in the last six games. The Bullets, 
who need an effective center, remained 2 1/2 games behind Boston in the battle 
for the final playoff spot in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Malone scored 30 points for the Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Dominique Wilkins led the Hawks, who have three consecutive losses, with 38 
points. They also lost guard Doc Rivers, when he suffered a concussion late in 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 104, Chicago 95 -- Michael Jordan, suffering from a groin injury, had 
his consecutive-game streak ended at 234, and the Celtics took advantage of his 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Lewis and Kevin McHale led the Celtics to a fast start in the game at 
Boston. They led by 21 points in the first quarter and built a 95-63 lead in 
the second half before the Bulls rallied to make it seem close. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 99, Portland 92 -- The closest battle left is the one for the seventh 
and eighth playoff spots in the West. 
</P>
<P>
James Donaldson had 19 points and 16 rebounds at Dallas to lead the Mavericks 
into the seventh spot -- and put the Trail Blazers in ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks are 31-27, Denver 32-28 and Portland 30-28. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Dantley of the Mavericks and Portland's Jerome Kersey got into a fight 
with 4:09 left, after Dantley, while falling, grabbed Kersey's leg. The Trail 
Blazers trailed, 85-77, at the time but scored the next seven points. 
</P>
<P>
Then Derek Harper's steal and layup climaxed a 6-0 Dallas run. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 112, Charlotte 99 -- Alex English scored 31 points at Charlotte, N.C., 
to help the Nuggets hand the Hornets their fifth straight loss, the team's 
longest slump of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't easy out there," English said after going 12 for 20 from the field.

MALARCHUK STOPS RANGERS IN FIRST START FOR SABRES, 2-0

<TEXT>
<P>
Three of the division titles in the National Hockey League have just about been 
decided. But nobody seems to want to win the Patrick Division, as four teams 
have held the lead during the season. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does the first-place team get extra money for winning, it also assures 
itself of home-ice advantage in the first two rounds of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
New York, the current leader, missed an opportunity to increase their lead to 
four points when they couldn't solve Buffalo goaltender Clint Malarchuk 
Wednesday night. Malarchuk, in his first start for the Sabres, stopped 32 shots 
during a 2-0 victory over the Rangers in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Andreychuk and Christian Ruttu scored the second-period goals. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres picked up Malarchuk in a last-minute trade with Washington. He was 
put to the test in the first period, when the puck was in the Sabres' end 
almost the entire 20 minutes. Malarchuk stopped 10 shots, while the Sabres were 
getting just two. They had only 14 all night. 
</P>
<P>
With Washington losing, the Rangers lead the Capitals by two points, Pittsburgh 
by three and Philadelphia by nine. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 7, Edmonton 3 -- There was a power outage after about 15 minutes of 
the game at Hartford, Conn., and when the electricity came back on, it was soon 
lights out for the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
It became too dark to see properly with 4:41 left in the first period, and the 
time was added to the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Before the first period was completed, the Whalers scored twice. Then, Kevin 
Dineen got two goals in the second period to help build a 4-0 lead. The loss 
ended a seven-game Oiler unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 3, Washington 2 -- Mats Naslund's fluke goal halfway through the third 
period gave the Canadiens the victory in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Naslund banged a rebound off the skate of Washington defenseman Rod Langway 
into the net for his 28th goal. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 7, Chicago 5 -- Aaron Broten had five points, including the 
game-winning goal, at Chicago to keep the Devils' slim playoff hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
The Devils, who are 9-3-2 against Norris Division teams, are seven points 
behind Philadelphia in the fight for fourth place in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 3, Winnipeg 0 -- Goaltender Kirk McLean stopped 26 shots for his 
third shutout as the Canucks blanked the Jets at Vancouver, Canada. The win 
also gave the Canucks a stranglehold on the final playoff spot in the Smythe 
Division. They lead the Jets by 12 points, and Winnipeg has only 13 games left.

Scott Corliss had a no-hitter for 4 2/3 innings and Mater Dei High School went 
on to defeat Corona del Mar, 3-2, in the quarterfinals of the Newport-Mesa

Corliss (1-0) struck out 10 and didn't allow a hit until Grady Lamar doubled

The Monarchs (3-1) scored three runs in the fourth. Juan Zarate doubled home

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;

GILL RETURNS TO LEAD NO. 4 ILLINOIS PAST NO. 15 IOWA, 118-94 
</P>

<P>
Illinois was happy to have Kendall Gill back in the lineup after a six-week 
absence due to a broken foot. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa Coach Tom Davis wasn't so pleased. 
</P>
<P>
Gill ignited a decisive first-half run that carried the fourth-ranked Illini to 
a 118-94 Big Ten Conference victory over the No. 15 Hawkeyes Wednesday night at 
Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
"He is one more dimension for a team that was already playing very well," said 
Davis, whose team absorbed its worst defeat in his three seasons with the 
Hawkeyes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not playing that badly. Illinois deserves a lot of credit." 
</P>
<P>
Illinois (26-4 overall, 13-4 in the Big Ten) kept alive its conference title 
hopes. If Big Ten leader Indiana loses to Wisconsin tonight and to Minnesota 
Saturday, the Illini can tie for the title by beating Michigan Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa (21-9, 9-8) had a 20-10 lead after seven minutes, but Illinois pulled 
even, 33-33, with 3:45 left in the half, before Gill led a 15-2 surge that put 
the Illini in command. 
</P>
<P>
"The first 10 minutes, I was beginning to wonder how badly we'd get beat," 
Illinois Coach Lou Henson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure Kendall had a lot to do with the victory. We're a much better 
ballclub with him. I think he's getting close to where he was before the 
injury." 
</P>
<P>
Gill, sidelined since breaking his foot Jan. 22, did not start and missed his 
first two shots coming off the bench. But he snapped the game's final tie with 
a three-point shot, then followed with a basket and a free throw. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors Lowell Hamilton and Kenny Battle, playing their final game at Assembly 
Hall, contributed 24 and 21 points for the Illini. Gill had 15 points, plus two 
rebounds, four assists and two steals in 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Liberty added 12 points, and Steve Bardo had 11 for the Illini. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Marble scored 37 points for Iowa, and Ed Horton added 21. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame 67, Marquette 63 -- Jamere Jackson hit a go-ahead jumper with 48 
seconds remaining, and Keith Robinson made two free throws with three seconds 
left as the Irish rallied in the final two minutes to beat the Warriors at 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Notre Dame (20-7) its sixth consecutive season with at least 
20 wins and strengthened the Irish's bid for an NCAA tournament berth. It was 
Notre Dame's 12th straight defeat of Marquette. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors (13-15) finished their second straight losing season, the first 
time that has happened in 24 years. They had a chance to pull even with eight 
seconds left when Trevor Jackson was fouled, but he missed the first in a 
one-and-one situation. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors took a 59-56 lead on Tony Smith's two free throws with 4:07 left, 
but Notre Dame got even, 63-63, on Jackson's two free throws with 1:58 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson untied the score with his basket 70 seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Fredrick scored 20 points for the Irish, and Powell had 19 for Marquette. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 77, Michigan State 61 -- Willie Burton scored 22 points, and the 
Gophers kept their NCAA tournament hopes alive by downing the Spartans in a Big 
Ten game at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The Gophers (16-11, 8-9), who have beaten several top teams at home this 
season, need a victory at Ohio State Saturday to strengthen their bid. 
</P>
<P>
Burton scored seven points in a 17-4 run that gave Minnesota a 60-40 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Smith scored 20 points for Michigan State (14-13, 5-11). 
</P>
<P>
TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
Western Athletic 
</P>
<P>
Utah 70, San Diego State 57 -- Freshman Josh Grant scored 19 points and had six 
steals to lead the Utes past the Aztecs in the first round at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Smith added 15 points and 10 rebounds for Utah (16-16), which plays WAC 
regular-season champion Colorado State in tonight's quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Ross scored 14 points, while Mitch McMullen and Shawn Bell each added 13 
for San Diego State (12-17), which made 22 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Mid-Continent 
</P>
<P>
SW Missouri State 73, Illinois Chicago 67 -- Hubert Henderson scored 27 points 
as the Bears earned their third straight NCAA tournament berth by defeating the 
Flames in the championship game of the Association of Mid-Continent 
Universities tournament at Springfield, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, a 6-foot 10-inch senior forward, who hit all three of his 
three-point shots, was named the tournament's most valuable player. Henderson's 
third three-pointer broke a 50-50 tie and put the Bears ahead for good. 
</P>
<P>
Kelby Stuckey added 18 points for Southwest Missouri State (21-9), which also 
won the conference's regular-season championship. 
</P>
<P>
Darren Guest scored 16 points for Illinois Chicago (13-17), which finished last 
in the conference, but upset Northern Iowa and Eastern Illinois to reach the 
tournament final. 
</P>
<P>
Southland 
</P>
<P>
McNeese State 85, North Texas 68 -- Anthony Pullard scored 15 of his 24 points 
in the second half, and the Cowboys earned their first NCAA tournament berth by 
winning the championship game at Denton, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament MVP Michael Cutright added 23 points for McNeese State (16-13), 
which finished in second place behind North Texas in the regular season, but 
upset the Eagles on their home court in the final. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Robertson scored 15 points for North Texas (14-15), but Deon Hunter, the 
Southland Conference player of the year, was held to eight points, none in the 
first half.

TOP-SEEDED BREA-OLINDA KEEPS ROLLING ALONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So much for Our Lady of Peace. Now, it's on to more difficult tasks for the 
Brea-Olinda High School girls' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
After beating Our Lady of Peace High of San Diego, 81-36, Tuesday in the first 
round of the Division III Southern California Regionals, Brea plays host to 
Reedley of the Central Section in a semifinal game at 7:30 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The winner advances to the regional final Saturday at the Los Angeles Sports 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Lemoore (19-8) plays Palm Desert (24-3) in tonight's other Division III 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Brea (28-2) has had just one difficult game in postseason play thus 
far, and that was a seven-point victory over Lakewood St. Joseph in the 
Southern Section 3-A semifinals. The Wildcats, who won the 3-A title by 29 
points over Atascadero last Friday, have won 19 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats are unbeaten against California teams. Their only two losses came 
in the Christ the King tournament in New York City in December. 
</P>
<P>
The question tonight is: Can Reedley (13-13) stay with Brea, much less beat the 
Wildcats? 
</P>
<P>
Reedley put on a fine defensive showing in the second half in beating Ramona of 
San Diego, 54-26, in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates held Ramona to eight points in the second half, three in the third 
quarter. Ramona made just one field goal in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Ainger, a freshman forward, had 18 points to lead Reedley. 
</P>
<P>
Aimee McDaniel, who had 22 points against Our Lady of Peace, leads Brea with a 
15.3 scoring average. Tammy Blackburn (12.6 points a game) and Jinelle Williams 
(11.1) also average in double figures for Brea. 
</P>
<P>
In Division II games: 
</P>
<P>
Valencia (21-9) at Vista (27-3): Valencia wore down Mt. Whitney of Visalia in 
its first-round game. The Tigers used their speed and height advantages to win, 
65-50. Kristen McDonald, a 6-foot senior center, had 24 points to lead 
Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be quite so easy tonight. Top-seeded Vista, which breezed past Canyon, 
80-38, in the first round, has the size to match up with Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Enger, Vista's 6-4 senior center, averages 26 points a game. Tuesday, she 
had 43, outscoring Canyon by herself. Vista led, 35-22, at halftime against 
Canyon, but showed its explosiveness by outscoring the Comanches, 29-9, in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The winner meets the Muir-Katella winner for the Regional championship Saturday 
at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Muir (24-4) at Katella (27-3): This is rematch of the Southern Section 4-A 
title game a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
In that one, Katella staged a dramatic, fourth-quarter rally and won in 
overtime, 54-48. Joni Easterly, a 5-11 guard, led the Knights with 34 points. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly, who averages 22 points a game, topped last Thursday's performance 
with a 36-point game in Katella's 56-39 victory over San Marcos Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Muir edged Bakersfield North, 62-56, in its first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
If the Mustangs are to avoid a repeat of last week's game, they need to handle 
the ball better and get it inside to 6-3 center Lisa Salsman. Salsman had just 
12 against North Tuesday.

A QUICK REMATCH FOR CORONA DEL MAR; 
</P>
<P>
MORNINGSIDE GETS REPRIEVE, WILL FACE SEA KINGS AGAIN IN REGIONAL SEMIFINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A free throw by reserve guard Weston Johnson with 3 seconds left in overtime 
gave Corona del Mar High School a 57-56 victory over Morningside in the 
Southern Section 3-A semifinals two weeks ago. At the time, it meant a trip to 
the final for Corona del Mar and a bitter end to Morningside's season. 
</P>
<P>
"A very tough moment," said Carl Franklin, Morningside's coach. "We just tried 
to get them (his players) through that moment. They took it very hard." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin asked the Southern Section office whether there was a possibility that 
his team -- 23-5 at the time -- might get an at-large bid for the Southern 
California Regionals. He was told no, only finalists would get bids. 
</P>
<P>
But days later came a call from Dean Crowley, Southern Section associate 
commissioner, who began by saying, "Carl, you're not going to believe this . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
Believe it or not, Morningside was in the regionals. Tuesday, it beat No. 1 
seeded San Diego Lincoln, 81-67. Tonight, it gets a second chance at Corona del 
Mar (7:30, Corona del Mar High) in the Division III regional semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
What might have helped Morningside's cause was that the L.A. City Section 
didn't have a team to put in Division III, clearing a spot for Morningside 
(which is in the Southern Section) to get the at-large bid. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they wanted to avoid having byes in the first round," Franklin said. 
"I just think it's a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside's first game against Corona del Mar was more of a nightmare. 
Morningside, the 3-A's fourth-seeded team, held a four-point lead with less 
than 2 minutes remaining. But Jeff Jackson's free throw and Matt Cwiertnia's 
steal, layup and free throw tied the score at 49. 
</P>
<P>
Fouls hampered Morningside throughout. It was called for 30 fouls and three 
players -- including starters Jeff Crow and Chris Vance -- fouled out. Corona 
del Mar shot 40 free throws, making five of six in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The loss ended Morningside's 17-game winning streak. Corona del Mar went on to 
the 3-A final where it lost to Trabuco Hills, 59-55. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar had an easy time in its first-round game of the regionals, 
defeating Tulare Western, 80-47, at Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Orris, Corona del Mar's coach, called it a "fun game," with 13 of his 14 
players scoring. But he also realized that the lack of competition didn't do a 
lot to prepare his team for tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish they (Tulare Western) had been a little better," Orris said after 
Tuesday's game. "The competition Thursday will be miles above this." 
</P>
<P>
And Morningside figures to be miles high at getting another shot at Corona del 
Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really looking forward to this," Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
Orris wasn't nearly as enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't be real excited to play them again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is Morningside's height advantage with a front line of Eddie Scott 
(6-feet-6) -- cousin of Laker guard Byron Scott -- Chris Vance (6-7) and Arthur 
Savage (6-6). To take advantage of his size, Franklin uses a double low post 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Scott averages 15 points and six rebounds. Vance and Savage each average nine 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar's big man, 6-5 Brian Spratt, has been its mainstay through the 
playoffs. Spratt, who had 17 points Tuesday, is averaging 19 in the playoffs. 
Spratt had 21 points against Morningside. 
</P>
<P>
In another Division III game: 
</P>
<P>
Lemoore (21-5) vs. Trabuco Hills (23-6) at El Toro High (7:30) -- Trabuco Hills 
center Rick Swanwick just seems to get better. Tuesday, in an 87-60 victory 
over San Diego Clairemont, Swanwick had a career-high 32 points and 24 
rebounds. He scored 15 in the third quarter. The 6-10 Swanwick is attracting 
all kinds of attention. Rainer Wulf, Trabuco Hills coach, said he spotted 
scouts from UC San Diego, UNC-Charlotte and UC Irvine at Tuesday's game. 
Lemoore has a decent center of its own in 6-5 Dennis Hubanks, who averages 16 
points and 11 rebounds. But Lemoore, which defeated San Luis Obispo, 85-69, in 
the first round, is a run-and-gun team that's led by 5-9 guard Tommy Jones, who 
averages 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
In Division IV: 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian (23-6) vs. Easton Washington Union (24-5) at Fresno 
Community College (7:30) -- The assignment for Whittier Christian is clear but 
far from simple: It must stop forward Carl Ray Harris. Harris, who scored 42 
points in Washington Union's 79-71 victory over Banning on Tuesday, averages 26 
points. He has set the Central Section single-season scoring record with 795 
points. That broke former Cal State Long Beach star Cliff Pondexter's record of 
782 set during the 1972-73 season at San Joaquin Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian center Scott Ferguson (6-7), who averaged 13 points during 
the regular season, has raised his game during the playoffs, averaging 19. 
Playing on a bad ankle Tuesday, Ferguson had 18, eight in the fourth quarter, 
as Whittier Christian beat San Diego Coronado, 69-58. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran (25-4) vs. Santa Clara (24-3) at Ventura College at 8:30 -- 
Another rematch, this of the 2-A final. But that's something the people at 
Orange Lutheran would like to forget. Santa Clara trounced Orange Lutheran, 
78-54, in the title game. It was the lowest scoring output all season for 
Orange Lutheran, which averaged 84 points in the regular season. Santa Clara, 
the top-seeded team in Division IV, does that to a lot of teams. It won its 
three 2-A playoff games by an average of 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara has one of the state's top juniors in 6-5 forward Shon Tarver (22 
points a game), whom Santa Clara Coach Lou Cvijanovich compares to former Laker 
Jamaal Wilkes when Wilkes played at Santa Barbara High. Orange Lutheran will 
hope to get more production out of center Pat Bagatourian, who had only 13 
points against Santa Clara. Bagatourian (6-3) averaged 20 during the regular 
season. Forward Daryl Cole leads Orange Lutheran in scoring, averaging 21 
points.

RANCHO SANTIAGO WINS ON MCTAGGART'S HOMER

<P>
John McTaggart got a mistake -- a hanging breaking pitch -- and turned it into 
a two-run home run in the ninth inning that gave Rancho Santiago a 9-7 victory 
over Cypress in an Orange Empire Conference baseball game Wednesday at Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
The home run, McTaggart's second in two days and fourth of the season, came off 
Jeff Patterson and broke a 7-7 tie. Cypress got a lead-off single from Doug 
Yates in the bottom of the ninth and a two-out walk to Bobby Thome, but Jim 
Short flied out to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson (5-1), who is one of the top pitchers in Orange County, struggled 
most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
He allowed 10 hits, including two home runs. He also threw wild pitches to 
allow two runs and balked in another. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Ramos hit a solo home run in the fourth off Patterson, who had a 2.02 
earned-run average coming into the game. 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't the real Jeff Patterson," Cypress Coach Scott Pickler said. "He 
battled the whole game, but he just didn't have very good stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago pitcher Willie Navarrette (4-2) was only a little better. 
</P>
<P>
He allowed nine hits, including a home run and four doubles, but also pitched a 
complete game. 
</P>
<P>
"He stayed with it the whole way through," Rancho Santiago Coach Don Sneddon 
said. "We needed him to go nine innings to alleviate the pressure on the rest 
of the staff." 
</P>
<P>
Because of rainouts last week, conference teams are playing four games this 
week instead of three. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago opened a 6-2 lead going, but Cypress scored four runs in the 
fifth. Jason Friedman hit a two-run home run, and Short had a two-run double. 
It was Friedman's fifth home run of the season and extended his hitting streak 
to 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
Each team scored a run in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago (11-6 overall, 4-0 in conference play) moves into first place. 
Cypress (15-5, 3-1) falls to second. STEVE KRESAL

IOC DOCTOR CALLS FRANCIS' SABOTAGE THEORY NONSENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An International Olympic Committee doctor who was in charge of the doping 
control facility at the Seoul Games dismissed the sabotage theory presented in 
testimony by Ben Johnson's coach Charlie Francis, this week at the Canadian 
federal inquiry into drug use in sports. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Manfred Donike of West Germany said Wednesday in an interview with the 
Toronto Star: "I can tell you this is absolute nonsense . . . When I 
interpreted the analytical result of Johnson's urine and took into 
consideration the steroid profile, I saw this was not possible." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Beckett, an IOC doctor from England, was quoted as saying: "It's a load 
of rubbish, let's face it. First of all, they were talking about someone 
tampering with his bag on the field. Then they started changing it into another 
story about a black man in the waiting room. Then they thought it was a white 
man. Then they mixed the two and got a yellow man. Did he have an antenna, 
too?"

A COSWORTH COMEBACK IS KEY TO RAHAL HOPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
From June 28, 1981, to Nov. 9, 1986, Cosworth engines powered 81 consecutive 
winners of Indy car races. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ilmor Chevrolet engines were in the winning chassis of 14 of 15 Indy 
car races. A Judd engine won the other. Cosworth, for the first time since it 
was introduced in Indy cars in 1976, was blanked. 
</P>
<P>
The perplexing engine question as the 1989 season approaches is this: Can the 
Cosworth make a comeback and become competitive with the Chevrolets? 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Rahal, who won the 1987 CART Indy car championship with a Cosworth but 
then switched to a Judd for 1988, has switched back to Cosworth and believes it 
is possible for the once-dominant engine to reassert itself. 
</P>
<P>
"I liken Cosworth to the story of awakening the sleeping giant," Rahal said. 
"For years, it didn't have to do much because it had no competition. Then along 
came Ilmor. Now it's back to the fight." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Rahal switched teams -- from the late Jim Trueman's Truesports to 
Maury Kraines' Kraco -- last year because he wanted a Chevy engine. Truesports 
was committed to Judd, and it was rumored that Kraco might join the group of 
Ilmor Chevy engine users, which includes the teams of Roger Penske, Pat Patrick 
and Carl Haas-Paul Newman. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ilmor executives decided to add only one new engine this year and it 
went to Haas-Newman after they signed Michael Andretti to join his father, 
Mario, on a two-driver team. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, I was disappointed not to get a Chevy," Rahal said. "But there were 
no promises made (by Kraines), and I'm a big boy, so I accepted it. Last year, 
I thought I had to make a change, Chevy or not, to a team that was associated 
with a major engine builder. The change from Truesports to Kraco was made based 
on that need. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I think, frankly, that the change may work in my favor. With only two 
teams using the new short-stroke DFS, we'll be sharing the development 
information with only one other team (Dick Simon's with Arie Luyendyk as the 
driver). I don't think there is any question that Cosworth has the capabilities 
to compete head to head with Chevrolet. Michael (Andretti) showed its potential 
in the Marlboro Challenge at Miami." 
</P>
<P>
Andretti, in his last ride as Kraco's driver, won the non-points race on 
Miami's Tamiami Park road course last November. 
</P>
<P>
"Tests on the dyno show the engine as considerably stronger than last year's 
version," Rahal said. "It is very different, more than just the short stroke. I 
would say that literally 50% of it has changed." 
</P>
<P>
Enough changes were made for Cosworth to change the designation of the engine 
from DFX, which scored the 81 consecutive wins, to DFS, for short stroke. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot at stake between Cosworth and Ilmor, more than meets the eye," 
Rahal said. "There's a great intercity rivalry, too, that has to do with 
pride." 
</P>
<P>
Cosworth's headquarters are in Northampton, England, where the engines are 
developed and manufactured, although they are distributed and maintained at 
their American headquarters in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Ilmor's headquarters are in Brixworth, a Northampton suburb. 
</P>
<P>
There is more, even in the derivation of their names, that is similar. 
</P>
<P>
Cosworth was started in 1958 by Mike Costin and Keith Duckworth, hence the name 
Cosworth. Ilmor was formed in 1985 by Mario Illien and Paul Morgan, hence the 
name Ilmor. 
</P>
<P>
Illien and Morgan were friends working at Cosworth when they decided to design 
and build their own engine. A transatlantic phone call to Penske led to 
financial backing from Penske's racing empire and General Motors, specifically 
the Chevrolet division. 
</P>
<P>
The new engine was raced for the first time by Al Unser in April, 1986, at 
Phoenix. Ironically, Unser also drove the first Indy car Cosworth, a DFV, when 
it made its debut in 1975, also at Phoenix. "Having a huge corporation behind 
me is a good confidence builder," Rahal said. "We worked hard last year to 
develop the Judd engine, but there is no comparison with the way I feel this 
year. John Judd's first priority is Formula One and it fell on Truesports to do 
a tremendous amount of development with a budget that obviously didn't match 
Chevy or Cosworth." 
</P>
<P>
Rahal, an avid golfer between races, is so serious about helping develop the 
new Kraco Cosworth-Lola that he skipped the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am to go 
testing. And he has canceled his plan to drive in the 24 Hours of LeMans in 
June because it might detract from his Indy car preparation. "I'm committed to 
making this team successful," he said. "I know (crew chief) Barry Green is, 
too. I told Maury Kraines that I knew the feel and thrill of winning Indy, and 
my commitment is to get him in Victory Circle so he can get the same feeling." 
</P>

WILLIAMS' STATUS UNCERTAIN FOR TITANS IN BIG WEST OPENER

<P>
Cal State Fullerton point guard Wayne Williams shot baskets on the sidelines in 
practice Wednesday, but his ability to start the Titans' game against Utah 
State at 2 p.m. today in the quarterfinals of the Big West Conference 
tournament remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Williams sprained his right ankle in the second half of the Titans' victory 
over Cal State Long Beach Saturday. He has been receiving treatment, and had 
not practiced at all until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we don't know if he'll start," Coach John Sneed said. Sneed said he 
will decide during pregame warmups whether Williams will start and how much he 
will play. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, 15-12 and seeded fourth in the tournament, split with No. 5 Utah 
State (12-15) during the regular season, winning the first game, 96-87, in 
Titan Gym, and losing, 90-80 in Logan, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
In other quarterfinal games today at the Long Beach Arena, No. 3 UC Santa 
Barbara (20-7) plays No. 6 Long Beach (13-14) at 4 p.m.; No. 2 New Mexico State 
(19-9) plays Fresno State at 7 p.m., and No. 1 Nevada Las Vegas plays Irvine at 
9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket will televise the final two games tonight. ROBYN NORWOOD

FDIC HOLDING $84-MILLION WHITE-ELEPHANT SALE; 
</P>
<P>
AUCTION ITEMS RANGE FROM 23-STORY OFFICE BUILDING TO 16-FIELD POLO CENTER 
</P>

<P>
The government agency that safeguards bank deposits is in the hotel and 
restaurant business. It's the phantom landlord of several office towers, 
shopping centers, polo grounds and a sewage plant. 
</P>
<P>
What does the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. know about changing bed sheets, 
flipping hot cakes, treating sludge or saddling horses? Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC inherited these properties after rescuing a spate of insolvent banks 
over the years, and it is now auctioning them off en masse to investors 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Banking experts say the agency could be involved in many more of these auctions 
in the not-so-distant future if President Bush's plan for solving the nation's 
savings and loan crisis proceeds as planned. 
</P>
<P>
Bush proposes to restructure the thrift regulatory system by giving the FDIC 
the added responsibility of insuring S&amp;Ls, currently the job of the Federal 
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. The change would pass on to the FDIC the 
authority of handling repossessed thrift assets, including real estate. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Asset Disposition Assn., a subsidiary of FSLIC, says it alone 
manages 2,400 FSLIC property assets in 33 states with an appraised value of 
$3.8 billion -- most the result of bad loans made by hundreds of failed thrifts 
over the years, half of which were in the Southwest. Among the properties: a 
497-acre safari park in Branson, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, the FDIC has its own white-elephant properties to contend 
with. 
</P>
<P>
About $84 million worth, or 20% of the FDIC's current real estate portfolio, 
will be sold today in a venture with the auctioneer Christie's and the real 
estate firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield. 
</P>
<P>
The event marks the first large-scale real estate auction for the FDIC and only 
the second real estate auction for Christie's, which is better known for 
pitching multimillion-dollar art collections and rare jewels, not empty motels. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur F. Lorentzen Jr., assistant director of the FDIC's Division of 
Liquidations, said the agency previously had disposed of real estate holdings 
through smaller regional auctions or sealed-bids sales. He said the Christie's 
auction exposes the select properties to a wider range of potential investors. 
</P>
<P>
On the block are 25 of the FDIC's largest properties, located in Alaska, 
Florida, New Mexico, California, Tennessee and Texas, where bank failures have 
been increasing. 
</P>
<P>
The auction targets range in value from a Houston apartment complex worth 
around $650,000 to a 23-story office tower in Knoxville, Tenn., worth around 
$24 million. 
</P>
<P>
A few had been owned directly by the problem banks while others were turned 
over to them as a result of loan defaults, Lorentzen said. 
</P>
<P>
When banks fail, the FDIC steps in to protect the deposits, then tries to sell 
some or all of the assets to a healthy institution. Sometimes it ends up with 
properties it doesn't want. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hires Managers 
</P>
<P>
A record 217 banks failed in 1988, up from 184 the previous year, with many of 
them victims of depressed economies in the agricultural and Sun Belt regions. 
Some of the properties inherited by the FDIC remain shut down, such as the 
172-room Skyway Motel in St. Petersburg, Fla., which the FDIC received after 
local Park Bank failed on Feb. 14, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Others remain open for business, such as the 192-room Howard Johnson's motel 
and restaurant in Knoxville, Tenn., once the responsibility of City and County 
Bank, which failed May 27, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't run them ourselves," Lorentzen said. "We hire people to do that. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything we have, it's our goal to put it back in the private sector. Our main 
function is to insure deposits." 
</P>
<P>
The upcoming auction list includes about a dozen land parcels, 3 motels, 2 
shopping centers, 10 apartment complexes and 5 office buildings. Earl Reiss, 
executive vice president for Cushman and Wakefield, said that domestic response 
has been good so far but interest from foreign investors hasn't been as strong. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more unusual items: 
</P>
<P>
The Retama Polo Center and adjacent tract, located on 596 acres in Selma, Tex. 
The parcel includes 16 polo fields, a 3,776-seat grandstand, horse stables, a 
veterinarian's clinic and apartments. Valued at between $7.5 million and $10.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The 23-story Riverview Tower, one of the biggest buildings in Knoxville, Tenn. 
Valued at between $20 million and $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sarasota International Trade Center, a water and waste-water treatment plant in 
Sarasota, Fla., valued at between $900,000 and $1.3 million.

Mesa Airlines Inc. has formed a subsidiary, Skyway Airlines, that will begin 
flights April 17 between eight Midwest cities and Milwaukee, company officials 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Skyway initially will have three twin-propjet 1900 Beechcraft airplanes serving 
Green Bay and Appleton, Wis.; Des Moines, Iowa; Saginaw, Grand Rapids, Flint 
and Muskegon, Mich., and Rockford, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Risley, Mesa's chairman and chief executive officer, said the company 
signed a code-sharing agreement with Midwest Express Airlines, based in 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Such an agreement, usually between a major carrier and a commuter airline, 
allows a traveler to book a flight from a city served by the first airline to 
one served by the second with just one reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Mesa serves 25 communities in New Mexico, Wyoming, Arizona, California, 
Colorado and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Midwest Express, a subsidiary of Kimberly-Clark Corp., has 11 DC-9 jetliners 
serving Washington; New York City; Newark, N.J.; Boston; Tampa and Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla.; Dallas; Detroit; Philadelphia; Grand Rapids, Mich.; Madison 
and Appleton, Wis., and Denver from the company's Milwaukee hub.

ALEXANDER LONGRIFLE DRAWS A FOLLOWING OF ELVIS FAITHFUL TO LANCASTER LOUNGE AND 
HELPS SUPPORT YOUTH COUNSELING PROJECT 
</P>

Elvis lives in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
That's what they say at The Pub in the Essex House -- the high desert's very 
own Heartbreak Hotel. Regulars have been showing up six nights a week for three 
years running, often with friends and relatives in tow, to hear Alexander 
Longrifle's unique tribute to Elvis Presley. 
</P>
<P>
Longrifle, a Navajo Indian, disdains high-collared rhinestone jumpsuits, 
pompadour hairdos, sunglasses or any of the other elaborate trappings of the 
impersonators who would be the King. When the 39-year-old entertainer is taking 
care of business, he prefers a no-frills approach that is short on glamour but 
long on endurance. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to love him," said Mike Axley, manager of the Essex House Hotel. 
"It's varied enough that some people show up night after night after night." 
</P>
<P>
In The Pub, a dimly lit lounge decorated in a colonial motif, ceiling fans turn 
slowly through a cigarette- smoke haze. The lone Presley-inspired prop in 
Longrifle's act is a framed poster of Elvis that hangs in the corner on a blue 
curtain. 
</P>
<P>
Longrifle, wearing jeans and a casual shirt, settles behind a converted piano 
bar that he covers with self-made, silk-screened sweat shirts (with his image) 
that are for sale. Flanked by a surreal painting of himself propped on top of 
an amplifier and accompanied by a variety of recorded instrumental tracks, 
Longrifle simultaneously plays a rifle-shaped guitar, drums, keyboards and 
chimes while belting out everything from "Blue Suede Shoes" to "Viva Las 
Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
Twirling drumsticks during a few of the numbers and cracking inane jokes 
between almost all of them, Longrifle serenades old and younger customers alike 
with Elvis melodies sung in a voice strikingly similar to that of the man who 
made them famous. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as he sticks with the Elvis songs he's great," said Jim Hagon, a 
security guard at the Essex House. "He does a lousy Michael Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
Longrifle's musical talents have resulted in minor cult-hero status in 
Lancaster. They also enable him to earn $700 a week -- a portion of the money 
necessary to keep afloat the Alexander Longrifle Youth Reservation, a privately 
funded, nonprofit education and counseling project that has made him something 
of a legend to more than 200 teen-agers and their families throughout Los 
Angeles, Ventura and Kern counties. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that Elvis, with everyone else grabbing his shirttail, would be glad 
it's going to something good," said Phylis Holland, a Lancaster resident who 
has seen Longrifle perform several times. "He takes people other people give up 
on and he gets them to go straight." 
</P>
<P>
The reservation, on 10 acres in Mojave, is about 15 minutes north of Edwards 
Air Force Base -- 25 minutes outside Lancaster. It was established in 
September, 1983, by Longrifle, who says he was a teen-age runaway from home, 
and four other founders, including actors Iron Eyes Cody and Randolph Mantooth, 
Paul Wolfe and Ben Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Today, it is Longrifle's permanent residence and the temporary home for as many 
as 10 teen-agers of varied nationalities between the ages of 13 and 18. Most of 
them are sent through word-of-mouth referrals from parents and former 
residents. Some are hardened runaways or drug and alcohol abusers. Others are 
experiencing problems at home or in school. 
</P>
<P>
The length of stay at the reservation, which is partially supported by 
$350-a-month donations from parents, can range from a few months to a few 
years, and is determined by Longrifle and the parent and child. 
</P>
<P>
"I love kids and I don't like people saying kids are no good," Longrifle said. 
"I don't care how bad you've been, no one can tell you that you can't learn. 
All these kids can learn, and I have faith in them and trust in them." 
</P>
<P>
Like his musical act, Longrifle's reservation is a no-frills affair. Access to 
the property requires travel on a dirt road capable of rattling the most 
sophisticated of suspension systems. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an island in the middle of the world," said Donna Briant, a matron with 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department who helps Longrifle track down 
residents who occasionally flee. "There's no fences and no barbed wire. It's 
not meant to be a prison. It's a place where they can grow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lost Their Identities' 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these kids have been through the court system where they've lost their 
identities. They gain it back out there." 
</P>
<P>
Longrifle, three paid counselors and a number of volunteer professionals 
oversee the daily activity. This includes four hours of schoolwork through a 
state-approved independent study program coordinated by the Mojave Board of 
Education. Students meet once a week with a teacher at Douglas High School, an 
alternative school located on the campus of Mountain View High in Mojave. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids really bring in the work," said Charles Brannen, principal of both 
Mountain View and Douglas. "Some of them earn a lot more credits than kids in 
regular high school. It's working well." 
</P>
<P>
Many former residents are enrolled in community colleges and trade schools. 
Others have joined the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these kids have been in and out of programs like these and they think 
they're never going to change," said counselor Cyndi Turner. "Alex has his own 
way of getting to them. He pushes them to learn and see that the whole world is 
not like the past." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glimpse of Future 
</P>
<P>
New residents get a glimpse of the future immediately upon arrival. An empty 
booth near the entrance to the property is inscribed with the slogan, "Built by 
the Youth of Today for the Youth of Tomorrow." And that is literally the case 
at the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Longrifle and the residents built everything on the property -- except two 
mobile homes that serve as dormitories and classrooms -- including a stage, 
corral, makeshift pool hall, skateboard ramp, remote-control car track, 
baseball backstop, dirt basketball and volleyball courts, and croquet, 
weightlifting and karate areas. 
</P>
<P>
Longrifle gives lessons in karate for self-protection and self-esteem. He also 
gives music lessons. Five or six times a year, musical fund-raisers are staged 
at the Essex House, with Longrifle and the residents providing the 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
The activities provide a forum for communication that Longrifle believes is 
unobtainable in a formal setting. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never sit here with a kid and counsel him," Longrifle said during an 
interview in his office at the reservation. "I do it every day, outside, when 
I'm riding bikes with them or whatever. If they're feeling down, we talk about 
it while we're shooting some baskets. We talk with them and counsel them, and 
they don't even know we're doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Life on the reservation, however, is anything but a day at the country club. 
Longrifle and boys are addressed as "Sir," and female counselors and girls as 
"Ma'am." Punishment for misbehavior includes push-ups, ditch digging and 
collecting buckets full of rocks. 
</P>
<P>
"Alex makes you think about what you're doing," said Dawn Tomlinson, 14, who, 
her mother said, spent seven months at the reservation after the death of an 
infant niece sent her into an emotional tailspin. "He shows you that you can 
turn it around if you want to. You can help other people by helping yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Said Diana Wilson, Dawn's mother: "They have to face themselves out there. 
There are no city games to play. . . . She came back a whole person." 
</P>
<P>
Longrifle does not hold a college degree in psychology. In fact, he is just 
short of completing his associate of arts degree in business administration at 
Pasadena City College. His methods, he says, are borne out of his Indian 
heritage, a tour of duty in the Army, work with youths in gangs and his own 
experiences as a runaway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Solo Act 
</P>
<P>
Born in Holbrook, Ariz., Longrifle moved with his mother, two sisters and "a 
bunch of cousins" to Texarkana, Tex., when he was 5. At 13, he "ran away" with 
his guitar and began performing with bands and as a solo act in bars throughout 
Texas and the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had any lessons or formal training," said Longrifle, who often slept 
in back rooms or in the basements of the establishments where he played. "I 
just picked up chords and things from Okie-redneck singers. I guess it was just 
in me." 
</P>
<P>
So, apparently, was a voice like Elvis Presley's. 
</P>
<P>
Longrifle was 15 and performing at a bar in Texas when a trio of female patrons 
who thought that he sounded like Elvis requested that he perform a few of his 
songs. Longrifle knew none -- but said he picked them up quickly with the aid 
of some records from the bar owner, who threatened to fire him unless he 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I noticed the tip jar went from $25 a night to $50 or $60, I thought, 
'Hey, there must be something to this,' " said Longrifle, who has recorded 
several albums of original material and cover versions of other songs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Musical Versatility 
</P>
<P>
Longrifle's musical versatility and his development as a one-man combo came 
from his experiences with temperamental musicians. On many occasions, Longrifle 
said he filled the void left by band members who failed to appear for 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
"If the bass player didn't show up, I'd play that," Longrifle said. "If the 
lead guitar player didn't show up, I'd play that. Same thing with drums. One 
time, nobody else showed up." 
</P>
<P>
When Longrifle first showed up in Mojave in 1982, he was a burned-out Las Vegas 
entertainer looking to start a new life dedicated to helping wayward youths. 
</P>
<P>
After winning the Gong Show's "Elvis Presley Tribute" competition with a 
performance of "Jailhouse Rock" in 1976, Longrifle worked the Holiday Inn 
circuit for a few years before making the jump to Las Vegas in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
He fronted a band, earned marquee billing, rode in limousines and led a life 
style that he said included drinking and drugs. "It was a custom as an 
entertainer. Most of the entertainers partied together. It got to the point 
where it bothered me and bothered my body. . . . Unfortunately, it was a 
movie-type situation -- entertainer gets wrapped up with bucks. 
</P>
<P>
"I was making five grand a week, but it was a plastic world," Longrifle said. 
"All of a sudden, it's a little fame, big bucks. I had to get out -- so I 
left." 
</P>
<P>
Longrifle bought the property in Mojave after seeing it while driving back from 
Nevada. He performed at the Burbank Holiday Inn during the week and drove to 
the desert and cleared the property of brush on the weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Now Longrifle is hoping to grow. He has applied with the Fresno-based Community 
Care Licensing Division of the state Department of Social Services for a permit 
that would allow 15 residents at the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to continue performing at the Essex House indefinitely so that he can 
continue earning money and seeking donations in an effort to keep both the 
legend of Elvis and the reservation alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm honest with people," Longrifle said. "When I give my word, it's my word 
all the way, whether I like it or the situation is bad. I stick to my word and 
that's what I teach these kids. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're trying to get your message across to people, to kids or adults, 
music is a hell of a universal language." 
</P>

SMALL MIRACLES MARK JUDAISM'S RITE OF PASSAGE FOR SPECIAL FEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1977, when her two sons were 5 and 2, Lora Jerugim gave birth to the 
daughter, Elisa, she always wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"I had fantasies about who she would be and what we would share. Of course, she 
would be completely articulate by the age of 2, and someday I would teach her 
to play the piano," Jerugim said. "And when she grew older we would recommend 
books to each other to read. I had images of our whole family sitting at a 
table assembling a thousand-piece puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
The future was set. 
</P>
<P>
But after Elisa was born, facts began to replace fantasy. At 6 months, Elisa 
couldn't roll over. At one year, she couldn't sit up. Her mother took almost 
daily trips to social service agencies, physical and occupational therapists, 
physicians and educators -- anyone who might be able to figure out what was 
wrong with Elisa. 
</P>
<P>
Jerugim said doctors could "offer no precise diagnosis," only that Elisa was 
"developmentally delayed." 
</P>
<P>
The future would have to change. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned to let go of the high expectations," said Jerugim, 43, of Los 
Angeles. "I decided to let her be who she was going to be." 
</P>
<P>
But next year, Jerugim will be able to watch her daughter fulfill one 
expectation that, only a few years ago, seemed impossible. She can watch Elisa 
go through one of the most important rituals in Jewish family life. 
</P>
<P>
Elisa, 11, is learning about Noah's Ark, Adam and Eve, and the Ten Commandments 
in Hebrew School at Valley Beth Shalom Synagogue in Encino. On July 7, 1990, 
she will celebrate her bat mitzvah, the traditional rite of passage when a Jew, 
at 13, becomes an adult in the eyes of the community. Boys have bar mitzvahs. 
</P>
<P>
"Both of her brothers had bar mitzvahs, and she's entitled to her day, too," 
Jerugim said. "Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
Elisa is enrolled in the synagogue's "Shaare Tikva" -- The Gates of Hope -- 
program. Established in 1983, the class, which meets from 9 to 11 a.m. Sundays, 
teaches a dozen disabled youngsters from Los Angeles and the San Fernando 
Valley the laws and customs of Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
Students study the rites connected with Jewish holidays and the ethical and 
moral guidelines written in the Talmud and Torah. 
</P>
<P>
And, as the students approach age 13, after about three to five years of 
classes, they learn the necessary skills -- reading aloud from the Old 
Testament, reciting traditional blessings -- to hold a bar or bat mitzvah in 
front of hundreds of worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
"The bar mitzvah is of ultimate importance in Judaism," said Neal Schnall, 
principal of Valley Beth Shalom Hebrew School. "Because it's so public, it 
cements a Jew's identity in his own mind and in the mind of the community. The 
Jew now has the right and responsibility to observe the laws." 
</P>
<P>
For parents, the ceremony affirms a family's status in the congregation. But 
for the families in Shaare Tikva, it means something more. 
</P>
<P>
When Danny LeCover, 13, of Los Angeles talks, his speech is slurred; his body 
movements are awkward. But he celebrated his bar mitzvah in October at 
University Synagogue in Brentwood after taking classes at the Encino temple. 
</P>
<P>
"How could we expect Danny to have a bar mitzvah?" asked his mother, Deborah 
LeCover, 43. "My God, he can't even hold a pencil." 
</P>
<P>
But Danny read several passages from the Old Testament, and he delivered a 
speech to the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
"Danny can share the rich traditions with us," Deborah LeCover said. "We can be 
a family. With Danny, there's no running to play with Billy or going to the 
mall. There is no soccer or Valentine Day dances. There's not a lot. So you 
search continually for something. Anything." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funded by Parents 
</P>
<P>
Funded by the parents ($370 per child) and the Jewish Federation in Los 
Angeles, Shaare Tikva is one of several programs in Southern California that 
serve about 500 Jewish students with learning disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Valley Beth Shalom, synagogues that offer classes for students 
with learning disabilities include Congregation Ner Tamid in Rancho Palos 
Verdes, Temple Emanuel in Beverly Hills, Temple Etz Chaim in Thousand Oaks and 
Temple Isaiah in Rancho Park. Shaare Tikva is run only at the Encino synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
"Our community has room for everyone," said Elaine Albert, coordinator for the 
Commission on Jews with Disabilities in Los Angeles, which helped set up the 
programs. "All Jews should have the opportunity to participate in Jewish life." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers and parents say it is unclear to what degree the youngsters retain 
their new Jewish knowledge and how it affects them emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
"What matters more is that Elisa is connecting with Judaism at some level," 
Lora Jerugim said. "She is a complete human being like the rest of us, and if 
we can provide her with the whole range of human experiences, that's what we 
shoot for." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Sirota, Shaare Tikva's music teacher, believes that the students sense the 
program's significance and value Judaism in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they feel a spiritual peace and that it feels right for them to be 
here," said Sirota, 39, of Santa Monica. "They have feelings. They just can't 
express them the same way. You can't keep these kids away." 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago at a Hanukkah party, Sirota said, he was singing with the 
students when a 6-year-old girl approached him. She just stood and stared -- 
and listened. Their eyes met, only inches apart. When the song ended, she 
clapped and walked back to her seat, never uttering a word. 
</P>
<P>
"But she had communicated with me," Sirota said, "and that's what it's all 
about. This class allows them to communicate." 
</P>
<P>
Each student finds something special in the class. Elisa likes to draw. Danny 
plays games. Another student, Noah Frank, 6, of Canoga Park, loves to read the 
Jewish calendar. Parents say the youngsters look forward to Sundays and often 
recite the new songs in the car on the way home and in the house during the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
As Schnall explains, Shaare Tikva tries to give students a feeling of what 
being Jewish is all about. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a proverb that says, 'Educate each child according to his ability,' 
and that's what we try to do here," Schnall said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repetition Strategy 
</P>
<P>
The main strategy of Shaare Tikva is repetition. Each year, the students sing 
the same songs, draw the same pictures and participate in the same rituals. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the reinforcement these kids need," Sirota said. "These kids aren't 
that good at retaining information. Occasionally, we'll bring in a new 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
The lessons are reinforced at home. The Jerugims light the candles on Friday 
nights, a ritual that formally welcomes the holiest day in Judaism, the 
Sabbath. The LeCovers go over the songs with Danny. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't that religious," Deborah LeCover said, "but Danny has made our lives 
more spiritual. It has made us more aware and sensitive to others." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen LeCover, deeply moved by Danny's bar mitzvah studying, joined him at 
the podium in October. The elder LeCover, 47, had never had his own ceremony, 
but he read portions from the Old Testament and addressed the worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been allowed to dream of unlimited possibilities and opportunities for 
Daniel," he told the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
The families in Shaare Tikva say they had some doubts about putting their 
children in Hebrew school. 
</P>
<P>
"Because there is such a high emphasis in the Jewish community on education and 
achievement, parents might feel uncomfortable because their child won't achieve 
in ways others will," Albert said. "There is a lot of pressure for academic 
excellence in the Jewish community." 
</P>
<P>
But the families overcame the doubts and became friends. Every Sunday, while 
their children learn about the past, the parents meet for coffee; they share 
stories and strategies and hope. 
</P>
<P>
They build strong friendships with the teachers, too. 
</P>
<P>
"They do such a great job," said Deborah LeCover. "They know how frustrating 
and yet fulfilling it is to work with these kids." 
</P>
<P>
Maeva Carter, 30, of Reseda, who has taught in Shaare Tikva for six years, said 
she never knows what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
"Every week, every minute is a roller coaster," Carter said. "One technique 
won't be working and the child won't respond and then, all of a sudden, he will 
remember something from a week earlier." 
</P>
<P>
The teachers strive for small miracles, like the mention of a familiar phrase, 
or even a smile. When a student surprises them by remembering something taught 
weeks earlier, the instructors rejoice. It is then that they realize the odds 
they must overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"They've done something wonderful," Carter said, "and then you compare it to a 
5-year-old, and it's nothing. A giant step for them is like a little one for 
younger kids." 
</P>
<P>
But there are giant steps. Like the time Jonathan Garden opened up. Two years 
ago, when he joined Shaare Tikva, Jonathan would not talk in class. He spoke at 
home, but in new, potentially uncomfortable situations, like Hebrew school, he 
kept quiet. He sat and stared for months, seemingly oblivious to his 
surroundings. One day, when the teachers asked the students what gifts they 
received for Hanukkah, there was a whisper from the back of the room. 
</P>
<P>
It was Jonathan. 
</P>
<P>
"He said 'white bike,' " Carter recalled. "We had to have him repeat it five 
times. We didn't know whether he could speak. Since then, he has started 
conversations." 
</P>
<P>
Once students are ready to prepare for the bar or bat mitzvah ceremony, Schnall 
makes it clear that the synagogue won't treat them any differently than 
teen-agers without learning disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We meet with them and go over the whole day, like we do with everyone else," 
Schnall said. "The ceremony is not some kind of freak show. We don't do shows." 
</P>
<P>
During October's bar mitzvah, the LeCovers were worried about anything that 
might demean Danny and point out his disability. Because of his physical 
limitations, Danny would not be able to carry a complete Torah. So instead of 
having him carry a scaled-down Torah without all of the Old Testament, they 
found a lighter one that still had the entire Scripture. 
</P>
<P>
The LeCovers say the ceremony was more than an attempt to give Danny a valuable 
Jewish experience. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a way we could connect with the Jewish community," Deborah LeCover 
said. "It's a validation of everything we've gone through." 
</P>
<P>
She showed pictures of Danny and her dancing at the Saturday night reception 
after the bar mitzvah. Danny was dressed in a tuxedo. 
</P>
<P>
"You asked if it was all worth it, going through the whole program. It's worth 
it," she said. "Look at him. Look how happy he is." 
</P>
<P>
This Saturday, the Greenspans of Northridge will experience the same pride. 
Their son, David, 13, will celebrate his bar mitzvah at Valley Beth Shalom. 
</P>
<P>
David was born without an ear, sees from only one eye and speaks slowly. But 
his parents couldn't be more excited about Saturday's special event. 
</P>
<P>
"He's doing so much," said Deanna Greenspan, 34, his mother. "I never thought 
he could do it." 
</P>
<P>
At first the Greenspans set low expectations. They would be satisfied if David 
could understand some of the Jewish traditions and make some new friends. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured he had a hard enough time with English, let alone Hebrew," his 
mother said. 
</P>
<P>
But last summer, David started learning the Old Testament portions he will read 
to the congregation. Each Sunday after class, he meets with a tutor to go over 
the readings and prepare his personal address. A few weeks ago, he was almost 
finished with the speech. As his mother watched, David practiced. 
</P>
<P>
The voice was raspy, the sentences sometimes hard to comprehend. The word 
"eligible" had to be omitted because David couldn't properly pronounce it. But 
he was smiling. So was his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"David will join with all the people around the world who have had their bar 
mitzvahs," Deanna Greenspan said. "Who would have believed it?"

CULINARY SOS: A NON-DAIRY MUFFIN LOW ON CHOLESTEROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR SOS: While vacationing in Flagstaff, Ariz., we had breakfast at Macy's 
European Coffee House and Bakery. They had non-dairy peach muffins that were 
out of this world. Please see if you can get the recipe for this wonderful 
low-cholesterol treat. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DEBBIE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DEBBIE: We thought the peach muffins made without dairy products were 
quite good. Using oil instead of butter makes the muffins cholesterol-free. The 
wheat bran and flour plus oats give the muffins a nutritional boost too. 
</P>
<P>
MACY'S NON-DAIRY PEACH MUFFINS 
</P>
<P>
1 cup whole wheat flour 
</P>
<P>
1 cup toasted wheat bran 
</P>
<P>
1 cup oats 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon ground ginger 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup chopped nuts or seeds (walnuts, pecans, sunflower seeds) 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoon safflower oil 
</P>
<P>
2/3 cup honey 
</P>
<P>
1 egg 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups diced peaches (fresh, frozen or canned, drained) 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup apple juice 
</P>
<P>
Combine flour, bran, oats, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, baking powder and nuts in 
mixing bowl. Combine oil, honey, egg, peaches and apple juice in another bowl. 
Using rubber spatula or wooden spoon, fold egg mixture into dry ingredients. Do 
not overmix. Batter should be wet and sticky, but should hold its form when 
mounded in muffin tin. 
</P>
<P>
Spoon into muffin cups, using ice cream scoop as measure, so batter is mounded 
to about 1/2-inch above top of muffin tin. Bake at 325 degrees 25 to 30 minutes 
or until golden brown. Cool slightly before serving. Makes about 14 muffins. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: I would love a recipe for albondigas soup for a chilly day. 
</P>
<P>
 -- ANGIE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR ANGIE: We love the Mexican soup chock-full of meatballs and vegetables on

</P>
<P>
SOPA DE ALBONDIGAS (Mexican Meatball Soup) 
</P>
<P>
1 cup fresh bread cubes 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound lean ground beef 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound chorizo or Mexican sausage, casings removed 
</P>
<P>

LIFE ON WHEELS: TOUGH TIME WITH SIGN LANGUAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Quick -- what's the opposite of east? 
</P>
<P>
No, it's not west. It's Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The opposite of Los Angeles? Not New York. It's Riverside, just as the opposite 
of San Diego is Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Don't believe me? Just check out the freeway signs. It's all right there in 
green and white. 
</P>
<P>
It's enough to make you wonder sometimes if our roads were actually 
manufactured in Taiwan and shipped over here with a set of instructions that 
bear an uncanny resemblance to English: Exit must lane right. 
</P>
<P>
At least one thing is clear: Traffic congestion isn't the only reason we have 
so much trouble getting from one place to another around here. Traffic 
confusion deserves a sizable share of the blame as well. 
</P>
<P>
So while we're wishing upon a star for monorails or cursing car-pool lanes and 
ramp meters, let's pause for a moment (something we Orange County drivers do 
fairly often anyway when we're on the road) to confront a problem that ordinary 
mortals might even be able to solve. Cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
So let's talk sign language. 
</P>
<P>
* Problem No. 1: The hidden ramp. The trouble here is in placement, not 
phraseology. 
</P>
<P>
You're driving along a surface street, cars to the left, cars to the right, 
more cars behind you and in front. Up ahead you can see a freeway ramp going 
off to the right. But you want to go in the other direction, which means you'll 
have to drive under the overpass or over the underpass. You'll also need to get 
in the correct lane, because sometimes these ramps go off to the left and 
sometimes they're on the right. But how can you tell if there's no sign? So you 
stick to the middle, ready to hit the turn signal and zip over as soon as you 
get the word. But all too often, the only sign is the one on the ramp itself. 
By the time you see it, your only options are a mad lurch across the lanes or 
going past and doubling back. 
</P>
<P>
Solution: Put up a sign for every freeway ramp to let drivers know ahead of 
time which way to turn. How much could that cost? If necessary, the signs could 
say something like, "Ramp Left/57 North/100 Yards." Even obtuse directions are 
better than none at all. 
</P>
<P>
* Problem No. 2: Let's say you do see the ramp, and you even manage to get on 
it. What you don't see, until it's too late, is that the freeway is full. But 
by the time you're on the ramp, it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
Solution (comes from Dorothy Adams of South Laguna): Put up a warning signal, 
she says, to let drivers know when there's no more room before they're on the 
ramp and can't turn back. 
</P>
<P>
* Problem No. 3: I haven't been to Pomona in years, but every time I get on the 
freeway to go to Fullerton, I have to pretend I'm going to Pomona. If I'm 
headed for Mission Viejo, I have to imagine I'm on my way to San Diego. Maybe 
some drivers enjoy the idea that the road they've chosen could take them 
farther if they didn't have to be home in time for dinner, but to me it's just 
plain confusing. 
</P>
<P>
Solution: Whatever happened to quaint but simple terms such as "north" and 
"south"? Or if cities must be named on these signs, why not the cities we're 
most likely headed for: Orange County cities? 
</P>
<P>
* Problem No. 3 1/2: Apparently someone decided to experiment with this idea on 
the Costa Mesa Freeway (which no one ever refers to as the "Costa Mesa 
Freeway"). At the Chapman Avenue exit, you have two choices: East and Orange. 
Both ramps, by the way, will leave you in the city of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Solution: If they can't call the "Orange" ramp "West," then they should rename 
the eastbound ramp "Green." 
</P>
<P>
* Problem No. 4: Names versus numbers. When was the last time you gave someone 
directions that went like this: "You take the Riverside Freeway to the Orange 
Freeway to the Garden Grove Freeway to the Costa Mesa Freeway"? Most people use 
numbers instead: "Take the 91 to the 57 to the 22 to the 55." 
</P>
<P>
Solution: Names are friendlier than numbers, but they're not as concise. Stick 
with the numbers instead. Orange County is a pioneer in this effort, since we 
already have one nameless freeway. It's the 90 in Yorba Linda, a.k.a. part of 
Imperial Highway, and it was once known as the Richard Nixon Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
* Problem No. 5: Caltrans, we know you mean well when you paint the road with 
messages such as "Left merge ends lane." You're just trying to be considerate, 
giving us time to read the nearest word first. But most of us learned to read 
left to right, top to bottom, and to us it looks backward. 
</P>
<P>
Solution: Turn the messages around or figure out a way we can drive standing on 
our heads. 
</P>
<P>
* Problem No. 6: Aren't they attractive, those green and white signs? Such 
soothing colors. Unfortunately, they're not the best for contrast, according to 
Dr. Clifford Terry, the ophthalmologist we talked to last week about night 
vision. And that means we can't see them as well as we should. 
</P>
<P>
Solution: Stick to black and white, the clearest combination according to 
Terry, either black letters on a white background or vice versa. But it could 
be worse: Freeway signs in Orange County could be like some of the old ones in 
the city of Orange: white letters on an orange background, barely visible day 
or night. 
</P>
<P>
That's the end of my list. But if you have any problems (or solutions) in mind 
when it comes to traffic signs, please send them to Life on Wheels.

WWII BOMBER LOST IN JUNGLE IS SEAL BEACH WOMAN'S GRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was a simple bit of curiosity, a matter-of-fact question about a man's 
not-so-distant roots: How and where, 27-year-old Thomas Hall asked his mother 
in August, 1983, did his great uncle meet his death in World War II? 
</P>
<P>
Five months later, they were fighting off dehydration in the Papua New Guinea 
jungle trying to find out. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Hall's offhand bit of familial curiosity touched off an extraordinary 
journey of the heart, a sprawling, snowballing paper chase that ultimately led 
the two Halls to the edge of a steaming lagoon half a world away to search for 
the last traces of a relative he never knew. 
</P>
<P>
"It sort of got to be like (Sir Edmund) Hilary and Everest," said his mother, 
Patti Domville Hall, 57, a writer and former paralegal who lives in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We did it because it was there. After my son asked me what happened to my 
uncle, I realized that no one had ever known anything about what happened to 
him. I thought it might be time to find out. It seems strange, but it just 
seemed like the right time to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Hall remembers her uncle -- her mother's brother -- fondly from her childhood 
years when he, Hall and several other relatives lived in the same house. She 
called him her "role-model male. He taught me to ice-skate, fly a kite, and so 
on, but his finest lessons involved not giving in to fear -- the 
pick-yourself-up, dust-yourself-off school of thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 47 years ago, during World War II in the Pacific, Lt. Thomas C. 
Domville, the co-pilot of a B-26 bomber, was killed along with the six other 
members of his plane's crew when the bomber was shot down by a Japanese shore 
battery over a New Guinea lagoon. The crew was declared to have been killed in 
action, but no trace of them has ever been found, and no one has been able to 
locate the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Hall still doesn't know. She returned from her fifth trip to Papua New Guinea 
Sunday with little more information about the whereabouts of her uncle's 
remains than when she began her quest. The most immediate evidence of her 
latest venture into obscure history was a bad case of jet lag. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't for lack of trying. Through minute examinations of military records, 
as well as face-to-face contacts with natives of Papua New Guinea and 
cooperation from former Japanese occupiers, Hall said she has found the lagoon 
in which her uncle's B-26 crashed. She believes the plane then sank to the 
bottom, to be covered over the years with shifting sands. 
</P>
<P>
During late February and early March, Hall made what she called "the toughest 
of all the trips I've made yet (to New Guinea) in terms of my physical 
condition. I came down with a bug of some kind almost as soon as I got there, 
and the boat trip was the roughest yet. It was about 60 to 70 miles by boat (to 
the lagoon), and it was open sea about half the way. You know when the locals 
on board get sick, it's a pretty rough trip." 
</P>
<P>
The latest trip took 17 days, 8 of which were spent living on the small boat 
and taking frequent readings off a device called a magnetometer, which is used 
to find iron-bearing substances under the water. 
</P>
<P>
"We did an enormous amount on a daily basis," Hall said, "doing magnetometer 
surveys and gridding the lagoon. We covered a goodly area, but there's still 
more to be done." 
</P>
<P>
What the expedition found were what Hall called "ferrous anomalies" under the 
bottom sand: iron-bearing volcanic rock that was "probably the very basis for 
these islands." 
</P>
<P>
But no plane, no wreckage, no bones, no identification tags. No trace of the 
bomber or its crew. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, however, remains encouraged. Six years ago, the plane's wreckage seemed 
as inaccessible as the moon. Now, she said, "we know it's there," somewhere in 
or under a lagoon of about 12 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
It took the better part of 5 years, Hall said, plus an ocean of paper work, to 
shrink the search to a target that small. 
</P>
<P>
The paper chase began with a letter inquiring about the crash, which Hall sent 
to the Army adjutant general's office in 1983. After about 3 months, the letter 
was shunted onto the desk of the Army's acting chief of the Department of 
Memorial Affairs. That department in turn referred her to the reunion 
association of the Army Air Corps bomb group that had included her uncle's 
plane and crew. 
</P>
<P>
Members of that group told Hall about Bruce Hoy, then curator of the war branch 
of the National Museum of Papua New Guinea. 
</P>
<P>
"He is without a doubt the most knowledgeable man anywhere in matters to do 
with the 5th Air Force in the southwest Pacific area during World War II," Hall 
said. "He has an incredible computerized mind." 
</P>
<P>
Still, she said, through the mail Hoy "could not be very encouraging. He could 
indicate the possible target the plane was headed for, but there was an awful 
lot of open water involved." 
</P>
<P>
Hall and her son, then 27, decided to fly to Papua New Guinea to meet Hoy in 
January, 1984, but "our initial meeting with him was not much more 
encouraging," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The morning after that first meeting, however, Hoy told them that he had found 
a narrative written by a U.S. pilot who had flown in the area during the war, 
dated July, 1942, which referred to a downed bomber sinking in a lagoon. The 
plane had crashed May 10, 1942. 
</P>
<P>
"My son and I reached the conclusion," Hall said, "that we should go (to the 
lagoon) and see for ourselves. We'd never been camping before, but we went out 
and bought a lot of camping gear, and Bruce (Hoy) loaned us a giant machete." 
</P>
<P>
After a commercial flight to the southwest tip of Papua New Guinea, the Halls 
boarded a charter flight for the interior, then chartered a reconnaissance 
flight over the general area described in the pilot narrative found by Hoy. 
</P>
<P>
"During the flight," Hall said, "both my son and I spotted what we thought was 
a very large wheel in one lagoon." 
</P>
<P>
They were dropped off at an airstrip about 60 miles away from the lagoon, then 
prepared to take a dugout canoe to the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
The canoe, Hall said, "leaked like crazy. We were bailing constantly" during 
the 24-hour ride to the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
Once near the lagoon, "we were stashed in what had once been a splendid 
plantation house," she said. "But it was the high point of their summer, and 
our problem was that because there was a drought, we couldn't get enough liquid 
into us fast enough to offset dehydration. It reached a serious stage after 
about 3 or 4 days. We opened a can of peaches at one point and drank the juice 
from that. We boiled water from the sump at the back of the house and made tea. 
We were drinking tea as fast as we could get it in us." 
</P>
<P>
A meeting between the Halls and villagers who lived near the lagoon was 
arranged. Patti Hall questioned the older natives through an interpreter, 
looking for firsthand accounts of the crash of a U.S. bomber. 
</P>
<P>
"The story of the crash of our plane was contained in local lore," she said. 
"One village elder told us what happened that day, complete with arm-waving 
indicating that a wing had come off." 
</P>
<P>
The wheel they thought they had spotted from the air turned out to be a coral 
structure, Hall said, "but it didn't matter. We knew we were in the right 
place." 
</P>
<P>
The next 5 years were spent sifting through a mountain of documentation, 
"trying to support the fact that the plane mentioned by the locals was ours," 
Hall said. "We had to find records for all planes, Japanese and American, that 
could have been in the area for a period of, say, a week or more." 
</P>
<P>
(Thomas Hall, a lawyer who lives in Colorado, accompanied his mother on the 
first trip only. However, she said, he has continued to help with research at 
home.) 
</P>
<P>
She wrote letters to veteran associations, ran queries in military association 
magazines, interviewed former Japanese and U.S. soldiers and fliers, often 
gleaning information through "an enormous element of what people call luck," 
Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Through a slow process of elimination, she said, she became convinced that the 
bomber mentioned by the Papuan natives "could not have been anyone else's 
plane." 
</P>
<P>
Three more trips were made in the next 3 years, but weather often curtailed 
exploration, she said. Also, sophisticated survey equipment was not available 
until the latest trip. Divers searching the lagoon on the third trip found no 
trace of wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
She decided to explore the possibility that the plane had been buried under 
bottom sand. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said her quest has generated unusual interest in the offices of the Army's 
Central Identification Lab in Hawaii, which is responsible for the 
identification and retrieval of remains of military personnel when they are 
discovered. Two representatives of the lab, convinced that Hall was closing in 
on the wreck, accompanied her on her third trip. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me at one point that no next of kin had ever gone to this extreme" 
to find a relative's remains, she said. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly 5 years, "some portion of every day and often full days" have been 
consumed by Hall's research and letter writing. "I haven't been doing anything 
else," she said. "Our house is full of paper. It becomes such a personal 
commitment that money is not a consideration. In its own way, it's a financial 
hardship. But compared to the sacrifices of those seven men, it's a drop in the 
bucket." 
</P>
<P>
Hall's husband -- who is also named Thomas -- has been consistently supportive, 
Hall said, although he has not made any of the trips. He has stayed home and 
continued his job as a sales representative for a sporting goods company. 
</P>
<P>
"He's told me, 'It's not a matter of should you go; you must go,' " Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
The search, she said, has actually begun to take on a momentum of its own: "You 
reach a certain point in resurrecting the truth. . . . You get to a point of no 
return. Half the truth is no good to anyone. Right now, we're going to regroup. 
We'll go back, sure, but I don't know when or how. Having tried is really the 
crux of it." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter before she left on her most recent trip to Papua New Guinea, Hall 
wrote, "I return to a question asked many times: Why carry a search to such 
obvious extremes? Some answer lies in this: that our original hopes to find 
signs of the crew have led not only to our 'resurrecting' my uncle in memory 
and (obtaining) new information about the war, but that we now understand 
somewhat better what his friends saw, felt and experienced. 
</P>
<P>
"What the 2nd Squadron, 22nd Bomb Group did, along with their fellow air units 
and hundreds of other participants in the sad old war, stands as utterly 
remarkable. Honor is the point."

GOURMANDS GO IN -- FEAST FIRST

"You can always spot the first-year people," said Sandy Stave as she surveyed 
the crowd at South Coast Plaza's Jewel Court on Sunday. "First-year people are 
real polite and they sit quietly. By the second year, they've got on running 
shoes and clothes with elastic waistbands and they're on the move." 
</P>
<P>
Before the night was through, though, 510 local gourmands had cruised the 
buffet paradise of "Cuisine Fantasy VI," a fund-raiser for the Orange County 
Philharmonic Society. Hosts are the Irvine Philharmonic and Las Canciones 
Women's Committees. 
</P>
<P>
This year's benefit raised an estimated $20,000 for the Philharmonic society's 
music education programs. Featured were such delectables as roast leg of veal, 
grilled beef tenderloin, linguine with prawns and sushi (not to mention the 
variety of soups and salads and the wall o' desserts), all donated by local 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The tables were covered with white cloths topped with snare drums loaded with 
fruit juices, mineral water, French bread and tangerines -- the theme 
centerpieces were to encourage guests to "drum up support" for the Philharmonic 
society. 
</P>
<P>
On the move through it all was Mitzi Tonai, who, with Mary Louise Smith, was a 
co-chair of the event. 
</P>

Asked why this year's Fantasy drew nearly 100 more guests than last year's, 
Tonai spread her arms wide, laughed and said, "Because I have 280 friends and 
relatives here tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Across the street at South Coast Plaza's Crystal Court on the night before, 
more than 750 Performing Arts Center supporters gambled and danced the night 
away at the Cabaret Chapter of the Guilds' "Casino Cabaret." 
</P>
<P>
The guests, dressed in the requisite black or white (or black and white) 
attire, munched on snacks as they tried their luck at blackjack, roulette and 
craps. 
</P>
<P>
Walking off with the raffle prize, a real 4-night cruise for two to Ensenada, 
was Paul Joyce of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the $60-per-person benefit (about 50 tickets at $75-per were sold 
at the door) were about $30,000, event chairwoman Debbie Novak said.

ANN CONWAY: CROWD GETS BRUNCH AND TIME OF DAY

<P>
And you thought a diamond-studded Piaget was a status watch. Well, the Guilds 
of Childrens Hospital of Orange County have news for you. 
</P>
<P>
The timepiece to sport on your wrist at their patron brunch Sunday was a "CHOCO 
the bear" watch. No diamond face. No fancy-schmancy band. Just an image of a 
grinning brown bear and a plain brown strap. 
</P>
<P>
"I love mine," said Carol Palermo, general chairwoman of CHOC's upcoming 
"Island Dreams" fashion show. "The watches are a fund-raising idea of our Jack 
and Jill Guild." 
</P>
<P>
CHOCO the bear, the huggable and adorable mascot of Childrens Hospital of 
Orange County, was among the 350 guests who swept into the Center Club for the 
champagne-laced tribute to fashion show patrons. 
</P>
<P>
But while most guests dined grandly on pyramids of fresh fruit and scrambled 
eggs heaped into pastry baskets, CHOCO typically went without. She (Dori 
Spydell) was just too busy hobnobbing. 
</P>
<P>
"I love doing this," she said after extending her paw to special guests Nora 
and Charles Hester. "It makes me happy." 
</P>
<P>
Not nearly as happy as CHOCO makes hospitalized children, or on this occasion, 
the Hesters. 
</P>
<P>
"We're thrilled to be here for the guilds," said Charlie, beaming over his 
visit with the gadabout bear. 
</P>
<P>
The Hesters -- for years boosters of CHOC -- will be its honored guests at a 
fund-raising dinner April 13. The event will crown the guilds' three-part 
benefit, "Island Dreams," which will also launch the hospital's 25th 
anniversary celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Deep background: In 1986, the guilds' annual fashion show had become so popular 
that it was changed from a once-a-year affair to a back-to-back fund-raiser, an 
identical show staged 2 days in a row. "Last year, we had 1,500 guests each 
day," Palermo said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the double fashion extravaganza, by Saks Fifth Avenue, will be 
staged at the Anaheim Marriott on April 12 and 13, but with something added: 
the same show plus the Hester tribute on the night of the 13th. 
</P>
<P>
Will a tribute become an annual affair? "We're going to wait and see," said 
Jackie Powell, tribute-dinner chairwoman (and fashion show chairwoman in 1985). 
"We just felt we were ready to see what would happen with an evening show." 
</P>
<P>
The nighttime event will enable working women to attend, Powell explained. "And 
it's also for couples. But a woman doesn't need an escort to attend." 
</P>
<P>
Powell said that many women have indicated they will "double book" -- attend 
one daytime show and the tribute to the Hesters. 
</P>
<P>
Palermo said it was Charlie Hester who "fluffed up my pillows and propped me 
up" when the guilds' board decided to implement the patron brunch a few years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I was patron chairman and he donated $5,000 and let us use his membership at 
the Center Club," Palermo said. "The event has been a winner ever since. From 
this year's patron drive, for example, we have already made $140,000 for CHOC." 
The money is earmarked for the hospital's Ambulatory Care Center, an outpatient 
facility designed to meet acute care and continuing treatment needs. 
</P>
<P>
Patron event chairwomen were Susan Carter and Fran Paulson. 
</P>
<P>
Principal sponsors of Island Dreams are the Fieldstone Co., the William Garwins 
and SensorMedics Corp. Major sponsors are Allergan Inc., the James Andreolis 
and TRW/Information Services Division in Orange. Diamond Circle patrons are Leo 
and Ruth Cook, Eddie Hopper Chevrolet, the Charles Hester Family Foundation, 
Koll Company and the Marvin Weisses.

CRITIC AT LARGE: A TRIBUTE TO A FILM NATURAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gregory Peck, who will be honored tonight as the 17th recipient of the American 
Film Institute's Life Achievement Award, got his first close-up taste of the 
movies as a child, watching silent comedies being filmed on the beaches of La 
Jolla, where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
He was fascinated but not awed, and he viewed the male actors in particular 
with suspicion. "Lounge lizards," Peck said during a talk we had a few years 
ago, smiling as he remembered a wonderful period term. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly because of his feelings about the lizards, acting was not to be his 
career; medicine was. His father was a pharmacist in La Jolla and Peck admired 
his work and the esteem in which he was held by the community. But there 
appears to be no immunity to the acting bug and it caught Peck at Berkeley, 
where he was doing premed studies. 
</P>
<P>
He switched to the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York. In the great tradition, 
he supported himself between auditions with odd jobs: being a barker at the New 
York World's Fair in 1939, a tour guide in Rockefeller Center. 
</P>
<P>
Barred from military service by a sports injury to his spine, he came back to 
Hollywood and made his first film in 1944. Directed by Jacques Tourneur, "Days 
of Glory" was a patriotic wartime drama about Russian peasants resisting the 
Nazis, but its claim on history now is as Peck's debut. 
</P>
<P>
He was a film natural, lean and classically handsome with a mellifluous and 
commanding voice. On the screen he often looked pale beneath the black hair and 
the contrast gave him a brooding intensity that was, however, sympathetic, not 
alarming, strong rather than menacing. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Marshall Berges in The Times' West magazine years later 
Peck complained that he liked doing comedy above all things but was seldom 
given a chance. "Five films out of 50," he said in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
He was in fact terrific opposite Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," the lovely 
romantic comedy directed by William Wyler in which Peck was a newspaperman, a 
lounger although surely not a lizard. Peck also received high marks as another 
newspaperman, married to a high-powered Lauren Bacall in "Designing Woman," 
directed by Vincente Minnelli. 
</P>
<P>
But, as difficult as comedy is to do well, actors who do it well are in better 
supply than actors who can convey stature, heroic nobility and a thoughtful 
sensitivity. Peck from early times had a career cut out for him as the uncommon 
man of feeling and honor. 
</P>
<P>
He received the first of his Academy Award nominations for only his second 
film, "The Keys of the Kingdom," from A. J. Cronin's best-selling novel about a 
missionary priest in China. 
</P>
<P>
There have been subsequent nominations for "The Yearling," "Gentleman's 
Agreement" (Peck again a journalist, this time probing anti-Semitism in a film 
courageous for its time) and "Twelve O'Clock High" (a wracking story of 
psychological pressures on wartime fliers). 
</P>
<P>
The Oscar itself came for "To Kill a Mockingbird" in 1962, and Peck's portrayal 
of the small-town lawyer in the South, defending a black man on a rape charge, 
is probably as fine as anything he has ever done, which is saying a good deal. 
Horton Foote's adaptation of the Harper Lee novel and Robert Mulligan's 
unobtrusive direction were just right, but it was the moral authority Peck 
brought to the role that gave the film its classic size. 
</P>
<P>
The only other actor who might have brought a comparable authority to the role 
might have been Henry Fonda, and there are parallels between the two men: their 
stature, their dignity, their ability to play American Presidents convincingly, 
their dedication in their private lives to good and sometimes controversial 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
There are differences -- the present tense is appropriate because films live 
on. Fonda is indefatigably Midwestern, as American as Omaha, with a laconic, 
homespun aura even in upmarket roles. Peck is somehow the unregional American, 
the all-encompassing Californian, quite at ease in the surtax brackets. Perhaps 
a contributing strength of Peck's performance in "To Kill a Mockingbird" is in 
fact that he was a less obvious choice to play the part than Fonda would have 
been. 
</P>
<P>
Peck will be 73 next month, and as he is being honored for a life's 
achievements, it is interesting to remember just how varied those achievements 
have been: the obsessed lover in "Duel in the Sun," the obsessed, mad Captain 
Ahab in "Moby Dick," a wigged-up barrister in Hitchcock's "The Paradine Case" 
and -- the real sign of the star -- the man in the title as well as above it: 
"Captain Horatio Hornblower," "The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit," "The 
Chairman," "MacArthur the Rebel General." 
</P>
<P>
Box-office successes like "The Omen," in which he had profit participation, 
have given Peck the freedom not to do roles that look unsatisfying going in. In 
1978 he took a fair risk, playing a mad and unrepentant Nazi in "The Boys From 
Brazil." Portraying evil incarnate is not Peck's forte, but by the sheer force 
of his craft he brought it off. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 he played the President of the United States in a low-budget, 
critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful anti-nuclear film called 
"Amazing Grace and Chuck," his most recently released film. It was a labor of 
love for Peck, who worked hard to promote it (and drew rave reviews for his own 
role as a President who was goodness incarnate). But Peck had less luck with 
his advocacy of the film than in his commercials opposing the candidacy for the 
Supreme Court of Judge Robert Bork. 
</P>
<P>
Peck continues to work, extending a screen career that now spans 45 years. He 
will shortly be seen in "Old Gringo," in which he co-stars with Jane Fonda. 
Among his many achievements, Peck has moved up through the decades with a rare 
and continuous ease. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope there will be older parts for me," he told Berges years ago. "I don't 
resist change. I love the seasons of life. I'm fascinated with the pageant of 
growing older."

YOUSUF ISLAM (CAT STEVENS) REAFFIRMS VIEWS ON RUSHDIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yousuf Islam -- as the former pop music star Cat Stevens is now known -- has 
once again explained that Islamic law calls for the death of "The Satanic 
Verses" author Salman Rushdie, and this time he has chosen to speak to viewers 
of the Christian Science Church's new "World Monitor" cable TV news program. 
</P>
<P>
The interview was a major scoop for the Boston-based news program and was 
Islam's first extended interview since he became a part of the worldwide furor 
over the Rushdie book. 
</P>
<P>
"When I studied (what the Koran says about this subject) I found that, yes, the 
evidence is all there," Islam told "World Monitor" London correspondent Ned 
Temko in an interview broadcast late Tuesday. "(Rushdie) has been irresponsible 
with his freedom of speech. . . . Any writer who abuses the Prophet or indeed 
any prophet, under Islamic law the sentence for that is actually death. . . . 
(Rushdie's writings are) as good as stabbing Muslims in the heart." 
</P>
<P>
Temko conducted the interview with Islam on Monday in a mosque north of London. 
</P>
<P>
Islam did not apologize for his controversial earlier statements and, indeed, 
reaffirmed his support of the Ayatollah Khomeini's call for the death of the 
novelist. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got to be seen as a deterrent so that other people should not commit the 
same mistake again," Islam said. "Let's face it, America has the atom bomb. 
It's a deterrent . . . able to blow up a whole nation of people. What we are 
talking about is a deterrent for individuals to be careful not to disturb the 
society in which they live." 
</P>
<P>
Islam chose the news program on the relatively obscure 18-hour-a-day Discovery 
cable channel, which is available to 37.6 million U.S homes because, "World 
Monitor" officials said Wednesday, he liked the way he was treated in a report 
that the program broadcast last fall on the rise of the Muslim faith in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Islam "felt he was treated very fairly, and he and Ned struck up a good 
relationship," said Sanford Socolow, the show's producer. 
</P>
<P>
Temko contacted Islam when comments supporting Khomeini's calls were attributed 
to the one-time singer-songwriter. Temko told The Times on Wednesday that Islam 
was "puzzled by the depth and range" of the furor over his statements, 
including destruction of his old recordings as part of radio station 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly that was what prompted him to speak at all," said Temko from London. 
</P>
<P>
Temko said that at first Islam planned to hold a large press conference or be 
interviewed by a major American network news representative. 
</P>
<P>
But Temko said that Islam was concerned about making sure his explanations were 
kept in context. "He wanted to talk at greater length (than most news shows 
would allow) and not be turned into 30-second sound bites."

MORNING REPORT: 'DIE HARD' HANGS ON TO TOP SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT , Arts and entertainment reports from The Times, national and 
international news services and the nation's press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apparently none of the recent crop of movies has the clout to dethrone "Die 
Hard" as the No. 1 rental, but one of the new chart entries could easily take 
over the top spot in the next few weeks. "A Fish Called Wanda," debuting at No. 
11, has definite No. 1 potential. Another possible chart champ is "Midnight 
Run," which raked in a hefty $37.2 million at the box office. "Run" sprinted 
onto the chart at No. 15. Look for "Big Business," which sneaked onto the 
rental Top 40 at a lowly No. 35, to take a big leap next week -- into the Top 
10. 
</P>
<P>
*"Married to the Mob" grossed a nifty $21.2 million in movie houses, but that's 
not the only reason it's such a hit rental -- debuting at No. 9. Its star, 
Michelle Pfeiffer, is the big lure. Since "Mob's" theatrical run, she's 
appeared in "Tequila Sunrise" and earned an Oscar nomination for "Dangerous 
Liaisons."

DRESSING UP THE ACADEMY AWARDS SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Big, glitzy and nostalgic seem to be the catchwords for this year's Oscars 
telecast, which was previewed Wednesday at L'Ermitage Hotel in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's bigger than life," said the show's flamboyant producer Allan 
Carr. "It'll be very much like a Broadway musical." 
</P>
<P>
The draperies alone, if sewn together, would cover one side of the Empire State 
Building, or so a press release boasts. 
</P>
<P>
The length of the street in front of the Shrine Auditorium will be covered by a 
red carpet. "The second largest banner ever made" will hang outside the 
auditorium, welcoming celebrities to the 61st annual Academy Awards, where the 
stage will be flanked by 24-foot-tall gold-leaf Oscar statues. The ceremonies 
will be broadcast March 29 on ABC at 6 p.m. PST. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside the auditorium, with its 6 million flowers, viewers will be treated 
to 11 sets-constructed by more than 100 craftsmen. One set will feature a 
re-creation of the fabled Cocoanut Grove, complete with a roomful of Cocoa 
Palms, neon signs and 200-foot curtains adorned with 50,000 beads and sequins. 
</P>
<P>
Also bedecked with beads and sequins will be the presenters, whose Oscar garb 
will be matched to the sets this year. Presenters include Jimmy Stewart, 
Dorothy Lamour, Doris Day, Alice Faye, Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
As he unveiled three of the gowns to be worn by presenters and described the 
lavish sets it has taken three months to assemble, Carr said he hopes this 
year's show will mark a revival of the glamorous Hollywood of the '20s and 30s. 
</P>
<P>
"The Oscars are about achievement and about stars and glamour," Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
The publicity surrounding the show is a significant departure from previous 
years where an atmosphere of secrecy surrounded the Oscars telecast. 
</P>
<P>
Carr said he organized the "sneak preview" to tantalize viewers. His hope is to 
draw more viewers than in previous years, when ratings have slipped. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be the year to watch it from beginning to end," Carr said.

CENSORSHIP ISSUE CONCERNS US ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The controversy in Pasadena over a move by Marshall Fundamental School 
Principal Joseph Caldera to impose censorship on the school newspaper should 
concern journalists and educators as well as parents. 
</P>
<P>
As a journalist who grew up in Pasadena and attended its schools, including 
Marshall 25 years ago, I commend the integrity and courage shown by faculty 
adviser Mary Ellen MacArthur, student editor Matt Luecke and The Eagle's Eye 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
This country is constantly uneasy with, yet drawn toward the tenets of its 
foundation: free thought and speech and human equality. The perpetual tension 
over the First Amendment between those who would restrict it and those who 
would protect it reflects a society's struggle to live up to democratic values. 
</P>
<P>
Board of Education President James McBath's suggestion of a forum appears to be 
a thoughtful approach that could lead to a valuable experience. Antonia Darder, 
a parent and community leader respected for her insight and ability to 
facilitate communication, should be among those asked to lead such a forum. 
</P>
<P>
Student Michael Comas' fantasy piece using culturally stereotypical words that 
"perpetuated negative images of people of color," as Darder put it (Times, 
March 5), no doubt offended some. Another article explored the relevance of 
reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Such topics have been known to upset people. 
</P>
<P>
Caldera may have thought he was accomplishing damage control when he moved to 
restrict the publication process. What he did instead was to run a more subtle, 
though far greater risk, of undermining the students' understanding of the 
First Amendment's role in a democratic society, where ideas are, literally, the 
tools of justice. 
</P>
<P>
Democracy never has been, and never could be furthered by censorship, which, 
however well-intentioned, is anathema to it. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Federal Judge Learned Hand, writing in a case involving the Associated 
Press, made an observation that might prove useful to chew on regarding this 
situation: 
</P>
<P>
"The First Amendment presupposes that right conclusions are more likely to be 
gathered out of a multitude of tongues, than through any kind of authoritative 
selection. To many this is, and always will be, folly; but we have staked upon 
it our all."

HUNTINGTON RECONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. of Tokyo has reached an agreement with Gemtel Corp. 
of Los Angeles to provide financing for the reconstruction of the historic 
Huntington Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of money the bank will provide was not disclosed. The cost of the 
project is estimated at $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Lary Mielke, head of Gemtel Corp., said demolition of the 82-year-old hotel's 
main building could begin this month. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel project was the topic of a bitter referendum in 1987 in which 
historical preservationists fought to stop the demolition of the main building. 
The preservationists were defeated by a vote of 7,032 to 5,088. 
</P>
<P>
The new 385-room hotel, located in Pasadena's Oak Knoll neighborhood, will be 
operated by The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. and is expected to open in late 1990.

CHAMBER CUTS AGENCY TIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anticipating less support from the Covina Redevelopment Agency this year, the 
Chamber of Commerce has decided to sever financial ties with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
The agency, whose members are the five City Council members, has partially 
funded the chamber. Last year, the agency gave the chamber $30,000 to 
supplement its $310,000 budget, said Randy Gordon, executive director of the 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"The makeup of the council has changed," said Tim Burlingame, chamber 
president. "Former council members were very, very strong supporters of the 
chamber. We don't sense that from the new council." 
</P>
<P>
In last April's election, Tom O'Leary, Gary Coffey, and Chris Lancaster were 
elected to the council. O'Leary and Coffey have sided with Mayor Robert Low on 
some issues, such as the renovation of City Hall, which the chamber did not 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the feeling of the (chamber) board of directors that our chances of 
getting funding would probably not be too good this year," Burlingame said. 
</P>
<P>
Low said that "the job of the council is not to rubber stamp chamber action. We 
have a duty to represent all of the citizens of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Cutting financial ties with the agency will help to make the chamber more 
independent, Burlingame said. The chamber may want to disagree with the city 
and the agency on future issues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to be able to do that without checking the bank account," 
Burlingame said. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon said that even when the chamber was receiving about 10% of its revenues 
from the agency, the chamber board did not believe there was a conflict of 
interest. By declining agency funding completely, the chamber is making sure no 
doubt remains, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber plans to make up the lost city funding by raising membership dues 
20% and by sponsoring more fund-raising events, Gordon said.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: HOME UPKEEP LAW STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has directed city staff to draft a property maintenance 
ordinance requiring residents to care for their homes and yards through regular 
upkeep and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The council took the action Monday after receiving a petition from residents 
who said they are concerned about the deteriorating conditions of various 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Dyer, a 34-year resident, presented the council with a petition signed by 
75 residents, asking the council to adopt a property maintenance ordinance "in 
order for us to maintain our pride in our city." 
</P>
<P>
Among other recommendations, the petition suggested that residents be required 
to regularly water and trim their lawns, park cars in a garages or designated 
areas and complete remodeling work in a timely manner. 
</P>
<P>
Most homes in the city were built in the early 1950s, and many are beginning to 
deteriorate, said Sam Engel, an administrative analyst who oversees code 
enforcements in the city. Some houses need paint, and others have overgrown 
yards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point in time, there is no real enforcement authority" to require 
residents to maintain their homes, Engel said. 
</P>
<P>
A draft of the ordinance will be presented to the council in May, Engel said. 
The proposed ordinance will include fines that may total $100 or more per 
violation, he said.

COUNCIL TO VOTE ON ASSAULT-WEAPON BAN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council is expected to formerly enact a ban against the sale and 
possession of semiautomatic assault rifles tonight, joining almost a dozen 
municipalities statewide to enact such laws. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the council unanimously voted to introduce the ordinance. If the 
council reaffirms its earlier vote, the ordinance will go into effect in 30 
days. 
</P>
<P>
The law, modeled after one adopted in February by Los Angeles, would ban 
semiautomatic or carbine rifles, which use detachable ammunition clips of 20 
rounds or more. 
</P>
<P>
Violating the ordinance would be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to 
$1,000 and a year in jail.

TRAINOR ELECTED TO SEAT ON ROSEMEAD SCHOOL BOARD

<P>
James R. Trainor defeated Robert A. Kehne II Tuesday to win a vacant seat on 
the Rosemead School District's governing board. 
</P>
<P>
"I've found out I've got a lot of friends," said Trainor, who serves on three 
Rosemead Parent-Teacher Assn. boards and has been a volunteer baseball and 
basketball coach at district schools for about 12 years. Trainor manages 
inventory control of materials for AT &amp; T. 
</P>
<P>
Kehne called himself "a new face for residents" and said he got a late start. 
But he said he plans to start campaigning immediately for an election in 
November, when three seats on the board will be at stake. Kehne is vice 
president of a metal-manufacturing firm and has been a baseball coach with the 
Rosemead Youth Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unspecified Problems 
</P>
<P>
Voters favored Trainor, 371 to 175. An additional 14 people voted, but their 
ballots were not processed because of unspecified problems. A spokeswoman for 
the county registrar-recorder said the ballots may have been unintentionally 
damaged, but that the reason will not be learned until the official canvass. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 560 people, just over 6% of the district's registered voters, cast 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Trainor will serve the remaining three years of former board member Rene 
Laverde's term. 
</P>
<P>
The county Office of Education in November ordered the district, which has five 
schools, to hold the special election after Laverde did not return from a study 
trip to Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Laverde left last summer, and occasionally wrote to say he was staying longer 
than expected, said Marie Ortiz, who was president of the board until December. 
Laverde, a full-time college student, also wrote asking her for board meeting 
agendas, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought he would be gone a month or two," Ortiz said, adding that the 
district tried unsuccessfully to contact him several times. 
</P>
<P>
The district received a letter of resignation from Laverde in November, but by 
then the county had declared the seat vacant, Ortiz said. She said she believed 
he is studying in a South African university.

W. COVINA VOTES TO BAN RECREATIONAL FIREWORKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Legal fireworks displays are a thing of the past in this city. 
</P>
<P>
Voters doused the use and sale of "safe and sane" fireworks by better than a 
2-1 margin Tuesday with a vote of 4,468 to 2,011. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome makes West Covina the 16th San Gabriel Valley city to ban 
recreational pyrotechnics. Fireworks are also prohibited in unincorporated 
areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we can go forward and really take steps to protect our homes, our pets and 
our children," said Steve Millar, chairman of Citizens to Ban Fireworks. "The 
first year is going to be an education process. Even though we had good support 
(Tuesday) night, the general populace is going to have to be better informed." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council outlawed fireworks on a 3-2 vote in August, but a coalition of 
veterans groups forced the referendum by gathering signatures from 10% of the 
city's voters. One fireworks manufacturer has estimated that the five veterans 
groups, the only organizations previously allowed to sell fireworks, made 
$120,000 from the sale of pyrotechnics for the Fourth of July last year. 
</P>
<P>
Firecrackers, bottle rockets and more potent fireworks are prohibited in 
California. Sparklers, cones and other fireworks that emit sparks but do not 
shoot or explode have been deemed "safe and sane" by the state fire marshal and 
are regulated by local governments. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 7, voters in La Verne upheld that city's fireworks ban by a 3-1 margin. 
As in West Covina, the ban was opposed by service organizations and fireworks 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
In both referendum elections, ban supporters were outspent by large margins.

Consumers may pay at least 5 cents a pound more for poultry over the next two 
months because winter storms earlier this week left millions of birds dead and 
hundreds of chicken barns destroyed in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Wholesale prices for chickens went up 5 cents a pound Wednesday and should be 
reflected in supermarket prices in two to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The price increases will be felt nationwide," said Bill Roenigk, economist for 
the National Broiler Council in Washington. "There is generally always an 
overreaction to weather in the market. The question is where do we go from 
here." 
</P>
<P>
The storms last Sunday and Monday dumped ice and then wet, heavy snow on a 
broad area of the nation's midsection from Oklahoma to central Illinois. The 
weight of the ice and snow collapsed the roofs of more than 600 of the 
country's 40,000 broiler houses and left between 5 million and 6 million birds 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
Broilers are the whole and cut-up chickens consumers buy at supermarket 
counters and as fast food in carryout restaurants. Several of the collapsed 
barns also housed hens that lay breeding eggs used to raise broilers. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're facing is not only a disruption in the actual number of birds going 
to market," Roenigk said, "but because breeder hens have been lost, we're also 
going to be losing some hatching eggs, and they have been in tight supply even 
before this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Cost Millions 
</P>
<P>
The storms are expected to bring the average retail price of chickens up to 
about 85 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about tens of millions of dollars, whether that is $30 million 
or twice that number remains to be seen," said Roenigk. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas, the nation's No. 1 poultry producing state, bore the brunt of the 
storms with losses that may exceed $35 million in buildings and birds, said 
Susan Whitacre, spokeswoman for Gov. Bill Clinton. At least 280 poultry barns 
were collapsed in four counties where the state is now seeking federal disaster 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty devastating," said Robert Moorman, a Sulphur Springs, Ark., farmer 
who grows chickens for Tyson Foods Inc., a major poultry packager. "It looks 
like a disaster. There are chickens just everywhere. We're trying to catch them 
and put them in other houses. 
</P>
<P>
"My chickens are 6 weeks old and would go to market in two weeks, but they 
(Tyson) can't get here to pick them up because of the road conditions. The 
chickens have had no feed or water since Sunday. I don't know how many are 
going to live. There are maybe 10,000 to 12,000 chickens (on the farm). I've 
lost probably 3,000 to 4,000, but that is a drop in the bucket compared to my 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
In Oklahoma, state officials are seeking disaster declarations in at least 16 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surplus Reported 
</P>
<P>
California, the nation's leading egg producer, was unaffected by the storms. If 
anything, the state's poultry producers, led by Foster Farms, Zacky Farms and 
Louis Rich, will benefit from the temporarily higher prices caused by the 
storm-shortened supplies of broilers, observed a spokesman for the agricultural 
marketing service in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Roenigk said the storms will not affect the price of table eggs -- in 
particular demand before Easter -- because there was a surplus of them before 
the bad weather hit.

U.S. WON'T BEND STUDENT LOAN RULES; B OF A FEARS BIG LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The parent company of Bank of America said Wednesday that the federal 
government has refused to relax regulations covering $1 billion worth of loans 
in the most expensive foul-up in the history of the student loan program. 
</P>
<P>
The action essentially voids federal guarantees on the loans and leaves Bank of 
America and several other major banks vulnerable to losses estimated by the 
bank at $450 million to $650 million. 
</P>
<P>
Those losses are likely to affect some of the world's largest banks and may 
cause banks to reconsider their participation in the federal loan program, 
which provides about half of all financial aid to post-high school students in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Education officials expressed concern Wednesday that it will become more 
difficult for students nationwide to obtain financial aid. They said the impact 
is potentially most serious on students attending community colleges and 
vocational schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Processing Mistakes 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very much concerned about the impact on the student loan program 
throughout the United States," said Samuel M. Kipp III, executive director of 
the California Student Aid Commission, whose compromise plan was rejected by 
the federal government. "The impact can only be a profound reduction in access 
to post-secondary education." 
</P>
<P>
The concern stems from the U.S. Department of Education's refusal to bend its 
rules and have taxpayers pick up the tab for massive processing mistakes by an 
Encino firm in handling $1 billion worth of student loans. 
</P>
<P>
The refusal came despite intervention on behalf of the San Francisco-based bank 
by several California politicians, including Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), and 
concerns voiced by educators across the country. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to A. W. Clausen, BankAmerica chairman and chief executive, 
Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos said his responsibility to protect the 
taxpayers and the integrity of the federal student loan program meant that 
guidelines on the guarantees could not be altered. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, dated Monday, followed a Jan. 31 meeting in Washington arranged by 
Wilson at which Clausen presented the bank's case to Cavazos and other top 
department officials. 
</P>
<P>
At issue are hundreds of loans to students, mostly at vocational schools, 
guaranteed originally by the federal government. About 40% of the loans were to 
students in California. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds backing the loans were sold on the secondary market. Bank of America 
served as trustee for the bonds, which meant it has responsibility to assure 
that the bondholders are paid off and that the loans are serviced properly. 
</P>
<P>
A consortium of big banks, including New York's Citicorp and the world's two 
largest banks, Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Fuji Bank, provided letters of 
credit to back the bonds. The letters of credit require the banks to provide 
their own funds if collections on the loans are insufficient to pay the 
bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
A chief cause of insufficient revenue is the failure to students to repay 
loans, and vocational schools have notoriously high default rates. But the 
lenders are normally protected because the federal government promises to 
provide funds for bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computer Failure Blamed 
</P>
<P>
However, federal regulations set out specific steps that must be followed in 
attempting to collect bad loans in order for the guarantee to remain in effect. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, United Education &amp; Software of Encino was hired to service 
the loans, including taking the required steps to seek repayment on delinquent 
loans. Last summer, a federal examination of United Education uncovered serious 
flaws in its compliance with the collection rules. 
</P>
<P>
United Education and Bank of America blamed the problems on a massive computer 
failure at the firm. Bank of America ultimately bought out United Education and 
hired another company to process the loans. 
</P>
<P>
But the Department of Education, after months of negotiations with the bank and 
California student loan officials, said the problems were so grave that its 
guarantees would not be honored. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was conveyed to the bank on Jan. 30 and the next day Clausen met 
with Cavazos and others in Washington in an attempt to persuade them to change 
their ruling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funds to Cover Loans 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth D. Whitehead, an assistant secretary of education who attended the 
meeting, said Clausen argued that the regulations were meant for routine errors 
and should not cover a massive computer failure. He also argued that the bank's 
shareholders would be hurt if the department did not reverse its decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The secretary carefully considered this and all the facts, but concluded that 
the integrity of the program and the interests of the taxpayers obliged him to 
maintain the regulations," Whitehead said. 
</P>
<P>
That means that the banks that issued the letters of credit will have to 
provide the funds to cover the loans without any federal repayment. Those banks 
have already indicated that they intend to try to recover any losses by suing 
Bank of America for what the other banks consider to be negligence in 
administering the program. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Wednesday, B of A said the estimated losses of $450 
million to $650 million include loans that are never repaid, the costs of 
trying to collect delinquent loans and the bank's legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
The bank set aside about $80 million in the fourth quarter of last year to 
cover expected losses in the program and said Wednesday that an unspecified 
additional amount will be added to the reserves as a result of the government's 
decision. The bank said its 1989 earnings should not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America said it believes that it has fulfilled its obligations as 
administrator of the program and will defend its actions in court. The bank 
said it expects lawsuits to drag out over several years.

SMALL FIRMS VYING FOR KEY ROLES

Amerasia Technology isn't yet a household word, but if Teong Lim has his way, 
its technology will end up in every home. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny Westlake Village company, which develops highly specialized heat and 
pressure sensors for the military, thinks it has a role to play in the future 
of television. 
</P>
<P>
Amerasia Technology is one of about 18 Southern California companies, most of 
them small or medium-sized, trying to win some of the $30 million the Defense 
Department has earmarked for development of high-definition television 
technology. Few of the small companies -- many of them headed by former 
academics or defense industry scientists -- propose to develop a complete 
high-definition system. Instead, many say they can contribute small but crucial 
pieces to the technological puzzle that will ultimately be solved by such 
giants as AT&amp;T, IBM or others. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't get a big piece (of the work), but a small piece -- a piece that will 
help make the others more successful," predicted Lim, a former scientist for 
Rockwell International who now is president of Amerasia, which had sales of 
$2.5 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
High-definition technology could mean big money for companies that play key 
roles in its development. Many experts believe that HDTV will figure 
prominently in industry, defense and consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
The technology, which provides sharper, clearer video images, could be used 
with computers to design cars or to spot enemy targets. But the consumer market 
may be the most lucrative area, with sales of HDTV sets and transmission 
equipment expected to be a $50-billion business by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the small Southern California companies hoping to get part of the HDTV 
business have made bids for defense department grants with huge corporate 
partners with ample financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
Symbolics Graphics, based in Los Angeles, made a proposal with Microelectronics 
&amp; Computer Technology Corp., a consortium whose members include such major 
technology companies as National Semiconductor, Hughes Aircraft and Harris 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
But Symbolics, which was founded in 1980 by a group of former Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology scientists, also turned in its own proposal for a 
technology its says can produce sharply detailed computer graphics. The company 
plans to use its high-definition technology to film next week's space shuttle 
launch in a demonstration with several other companies, including Bell South 
and Sony. 
</P>
<P>
Symbolics, like other small Southern California technology companies, says it 
wants to keep the details of its proposal secret for competitive reasons. 
Still, Thomas L. McMahon, director of graphics research and development, said 
he isn't too concerned about the size of some of his competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not intimidating. Its really part of playing the game," he said. "It's my 
understanding that (the Defense Department) wants to stimulate the U.S. 
technological base. IBM has a lot of technology, but the smaller guys do, too." 
</P>
<P>
Other small companies can count on the help of well-financed owners. PCO, a 
Chatsworth company owned by Corning Glass Works and IBM, wants to develop a 
device that would receive high-definition television signals from both 
fiber-optic cables, and over-the-air transmissions. PCO makes special devices 
that allow information to pass from fiber optic cables to telephones and 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
PCO's proposed device "would allow higher-quality pictures to be achieved as 
more and more fiber-optic transmission systems are implemented," said James 
Goell, vice president for special projects. Goell said he couldn't comment on 
whether PCO would work with its owners, which separately submitted their own 
proposals to the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
Interstate Electronics Corp., an Anaheim defense contractor with about $150 
million in 1988 sales, is owned by Figgie International of Richmond, Va. Bert 
Weinstein, planning director for Interstate Electronics, said his company hopes 
to turn its experience with liquid crystal technology -- the same technology 
used in digital watches -- into a research grant. 
</P>
<P>
High-definition technology is important to his company, he said. "It's going to 
tie into the military display business, and so we have to be up with it 
somehow." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't certain about Interstate Electronic's chances, however. "This is hard 
to judge. We're certainly not regarded as high as some others. But we wouldn't 
have a proposal out there if we didn't think we had a chance." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego-based Qualcomm, which develops two-way communications systems for the 
military, wants to tackle some of the signal transmission problems generated by 
HDTV, said Qualcomm founder and Chairman Irwin Mark Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
"One problem with HDTV is that you have to fit much more information into a 
limited band width," Jacobs said. "You have to treat that information very 
carefully. We're interested in how you properly compress that signal, transmit 
it and restore it at the other end." 
</P>
<P>
Optics, a 2-year-old Westlake Village company created by two former Hughes 
Aircraft scientists, submitted a "pseudo proposal," said President Robert E. 
Fischer. The company, which has three employees, does consulting in special 
optical technologies that are used to make computer chips, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"These technologies are going to be used in high-definition in one way or 
another," said Fischer, who added that he wasn't seeking grant money, but 
perhaps work as a "technical monitor." He said, "We just wrote a letter to the 
Defense Department to let them know we're here."

TOYOTA CAN USE THE LEXUS NAME ON NEW CAR LINE, APPEALS COURT RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
An appellate court has decided that Toyota can use the Lexus name on a new line 
of luxury cars, the car company said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
By a 3-0 vote, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a ruling by a 
federal judge who found that Toyota's plan to use the name Lexus infringed on 
the trademark rights of the company that owns Lexis, a computerized legal 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota's U.S. subsidiary, which is headquartered in Torrance, said the ruling 
by a federal appeals court in New York would allow it to proceed on schedule 
with national advertising to announce the premier of the Lexus line. The car 
was first shown at an automobile show in Detroit in January and is expected in 
showrooms by September. The company will probably start a newspaper campaign in 
June, Toyota spokeswoman Mindy Weiman-Geller said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruling was against Mead Data Central Inc. 
of Dayton Ohio, which had argued that Toyota's Lexus name infringed on its 
Lexis legal information retrieval service. Mead offers the Lexis service, among 
others, to law firms, businesses and other organizations that pay fees for 
access to certain information. 
</P>
<P>
Mead declined comment on the appeals court ruling until its attorneys have read 
the entire opinion, which was not made available on Wednesday. Toyota said that 
it is possible the ruling may be appealed, but that it had received no 
indication of how Mead would respond. 
</P>
<P>
Following Mead's lawsuit late last year, U. S. District Judge David Edelstein 
ruled that because of New York state law Toyota would be unable to use the 
Lexus name, which he said would dilute the effect of Mead's Lexis name. Later, 
Toyota was permitted to use the Lexus name at automobile shows in Los Angeles, 
Detroit and Chicago, but was barred from national advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota, plans to sell two models of the Japanese-made Lexus cars at prices 
ranging from $20,000 to about $35,000. Nissan, another Japanese automobile 
manufacturer, has also introduced a new line of luxury cars called Infiniti, 
which will also be in automobile showrooms this fall at prices in the range of 
the Lexus prices.

Potential Pipeline Partners Emerge: Two more potential partners emerged in the 
competition to build a natural gas pipeline into California. Pacific Gas &amp; 
Electric agreed to drop its opposition to a proposal by Coastal Corp. for a 
Wyoming-to-Kern County pipeline in return for the option to supplant the 
California portion of the proposed line with an expansion of PG&amp;E's 
existing lines. That could significantly cut the cost of the project, said 
officials at the California Public Utilities Commission. At least four other 
projects are in the works, including a separate line from Canada proposed by a 
PG&amp;E subsidiary, which the utility said it would continue to develop.

Consolidated Seeks Bankruptcy Protection: Consolidated Oil &amp; Gas Inc., 
recently taken over by a group of disgruntled investors, has filed for Chapter 
11 reorganization in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. In its filing, Consolidated listed 
assets of $38.6 million and liabilities of $51.5 million. The Denver company 
has been under financial pressure in recent years because of slumping oil and 
gas prices. In 1987, it reported a $9.3-million loss, compared to a loss of 
$21.5 million the previous year.

Sale of Coleco Explored: Coleco Industries Inc.'s board has authorized 
management to look into selling the toy company as a means of solving its 
financial problems, but no potential purchasers have been identified. J. Brian 
Clarke, president and chief executive of the Avon, Conn.-based company that has 
$540.3 million in debts, said the board took the action two weeks ago. The 
committee representing Coleco's creditors in its bankruptcy case has also 
approved exploring a sale, Clarke said. Morton E. Handel, Coleco's chairman, 
said no purchase offers have been received. He wouldn't say whether any talks 
with interested bidders have been held.

GRAND MET AGREES TO SELL PILLSBURY S&amp;A RESTAURANTS

Grand Metropolitan PLC, Pillsbury's new owner, sliced off another section of 
the food and restaurant group Wednesday, agreeing to sell the S&amp;A 
Restaurant Corp. to an investor group including top managers for $431 million. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;A was part of Pillsbury Co., acquired by Grand Met in January. Grand Met 
has launched a program of cost cuts and asset sales as it attempts to make 
Pillsbury more profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Met said in a statement that the investor group was led by DSJ/Inverness 
&amp; Co. and the senior management of S&amp;A. Financing will be provided by 
Citicorp's Citicorp Venture Capital Ltd. and others. 
</P>
<P>
In its first move to slim down Pillsbury, Grand Met cut the company's 
Minneapolis headquarters staff by nearly a quarter with 550 layoffs earlier 
this week. London-based Grand Met bought Pillsbury, one of the best-known U.S. 
food and restaurant companies, for about $5.7 billion after a bitter struggle 
that included repeated legal clashes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sold Together 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;A, with Steak &amp; Ale and Bennigan's family restaurant chains, has a 
total of 380 outlets. It had sales of $716 million in the fiscal year ended May 
31, 1988, and operating income of $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Met had previously stated that it would sell the S&amp;A restaurant 
business to comply with laws in most states that prohibit a distiller from 
owning retail liquor outlets or restaurants that serve alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
"We will invest the proceeds (from the sale) in the growth of Pillsbury Foods 
and Burger King to enhance shareholders' investment in Grand Met's most 
recently acquired U.S. operation," said Ian Martin, chief executive of Grand 
Met's food operations. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Adelman, food industry analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, said the two 
chains had to be sold together because Bennigan's has been profitable while 
Steak &amp; Ale has had less successful because Americans are consuming less 
beef and many outlets are in Texas where the economy is weak.

DU PONT PROCESS FOR FIBER DOCUMENTED, AFFIDAVIT IN EXTORTION CASE CLAIMS; 
</P>
<P>
STOLEN PAPERS ALLEGEDLY DETAIL SPANDEX SECRETS

<P>
An affidavit filed in a case stemming from a $10-million attempted extortion of 
Du Pont Co. shows stolen documents detailed company secrets for its spandex 
fiber. 
</P>
<P>
In the affidavit filed in U.S. District Court, FBI Special Agent Charles Flagg 
said the documents ranged from "blueprints for the construction of the Du Pont 
Lycra manufacturing plants" to the company's specific process for manufacturing 
the spandex fiber, "including mixtures, formulas, pressures, operating 
temperatures, plant maintenance and all necessary related technology." 
</P>
<P>
In the affidavit, Salim M. Ibrahim of Geneva, who directs Du Pont's worldwide 
Lycra business and helped develop the spandex fiber process, told Flagg, "a 
knowledgeable individual or chemical company would be in a position to 
duplicate the Lycra manufacturing process" if they had access to the documents. 
</P>
<P>
Lycra is primarily used in swimming suits, sportswear and stockings. 
</P>
<P>
Four former employees at the Du Pont Lycra manufacturing plant in Mercedes, 
Argentina, were arrested Feb. 28 in Geneva after an aborted meeting at which 
they were to pick up the $10 million in exchange for more than 1,000 documents 
stolen from the plant. 
</P>
<P>
A fifth suspect, also a former employee, remained at large Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
All are charged with attempted extortion and conspiracy to extort, according to 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Edmond Falgowski. 
</P>
<P>
If the suspects fight extradition, it could take up to two months to have them 
returned to the United States, Falgowski said, adding, if they waive 
extradition, they could be in Delaware in about a week. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit alleges Isaac Assa, a Mexican citizen who manufactures spandex in 
Mexico City, hired Bruno Skerianz, who in turn enticed three employees of the 
Argentina plant to work for him. 
</P>
<P>
Skerianz, who worked for Du Pont 20 years ago, was among the Argentine 
nationals arrested last week. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Armando Giordano, 36, former superintendent of Lycra operations, and 
Antonio Ruben Inigo, 39, former maintenance supervisor of Lycra production at 
the plant, were allegedly recruited by Skerianz and arrested last month. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Ines Lorenzo de Bianchini, 39, former custodian of the technical records 
at the plant with access to the documents, was also arrested. The affidavit 
says she was drawn into the scheme by Inigo, who allegedly was her lover. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Maria Peterosino, 44, a former engineer on the Lycra production line, 
remains at large. He too, was allegedly recruited by Skerianz. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit says Assa's first contact with Du Pont came in a meeting Nov. 10 
and a second meeting the following day at company headquarters in Wilmington 
with Ibrahim and Paul G. Gillease, who directs Du Pont's textile fibers 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Assa told them he had hired Skerianz to gather technical information about 
spandex to make his company more competitive and that Skerianz had Du Pont 
secrets. Assa said Skerianz was negotiating to sell the information to the 
Italian fiber maker Ridici, the affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
Skerianz met in December in Wilmington with Ibrahim and Gillease, demanding $10 
million for the documents and promising the former employees would not open a 
competing spandex operation for five years, the affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
Skerianz met again with Ibrahim and Gillease in Wilmington on Jan. 9. The Du 
Pont executives were accompanied by an undercover FBI agent, the affidavit 
says. 
</P>
<P>
After examining the documents Jan. 27 in Milan, Italy, Gillease called Skerianz 
to agree to the $10-million payment.

ALR PLANS TO UNVEIL CLONE OF IBM COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Advanced Logic Research, a small but rapidly growing Irvine computer maker, 
next week will become the third U.S. manufacturer to introduce a clone of 
International Business Machine's PS/2 line of personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
ALR's announcement comes at a time when IBM is stepping up its efforts to 
establish the PS/2 Micro Channel as an industry standard, accepted by the 
hundreds of companies that produce personal computers and accessory products. 
Micro Channel is the internal data pathway used inside the PS/2 machines. 
</P>
<P>
Tandy Corp. and Dell Computer Corp. have also introduced clones of the IBM PS/2 
line. 
</P>
<P>
ALR, which will formally announce its Micro Channel clone on March 17, claims 
that its machine will be able to process data faster than the comparable IBM, 
Tandy or Dell models. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slow to Catch On 
</P>
<P>
Since its entry into the personal computer market in 1981, IBM has been the 
standard-setter for the design of the internal workings of desktop computers. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, however, a group of computer companies challenged IBM's 
dominance by unveiling plans for a rival standard. The group was led by Compaq 
Computer, a leading maker of IBM-compatible machines, and included AST 
Research, an Irvine PC maker. 
</P>
<P>
IBM has been hoping that the Micro Channel, like its earlier AT and XT designs, 
would catch on in the industry. But until recently the IBM standard has been 
slow to catch on. 
</P>
<P>
In the past several months, "there has been a tremendous amount of interest" in 
Micro Channel, said Dave Kirkey, ALR's vice president of sales. "IBM is really 
putting a lot of effort into making it a successful product." 
</P>
<P>
ALR hopes to benefit from wider acceptance of IBM's Micro Channel design among 
corporate customers in much the same way that clone-makers have in the past: by 
offering competitively priced and often more powerful versions of the IBM 
models. 
</P>
<P>
But one industry analyst doubts that the ALR strategy will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"The corporate customers who are buying (Micro Channel) machines are not buying 
them for the technology, but because they are made by IBM," said Richard 
Shaffer, publisher of the New York-based Computer Letter. 'I don't think ALR is 
going to get much out of (the Micro Channel) product. What do you get from them 
that you can't get from IBM, Tandy or Dell?" 
</P>
<P>
ALR President Gene Lu disagreed. "There's always a business opportunity when 
you have a significantly better product than IBM," he said. "There are needs in 
the industry we can fulfill that IBM cannot." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1984, privately held ALR has grown from sales of $15 million two 
years ago to $40 million for the fiscal year that ended last September, Lu 
said. ALR expects sales to reach nearly $100 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
ALR is 60% owned by Singapore-based Wearnes Bros. Ltd. It employs slightly more 
than 200 people, mostly in Irvine.

Sterling Software Inc. said the General Services Board of Contract Appeals has 
directed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to reopen bidding on 
a contract Sterling claimed was unfairly awarded to another bidder. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling said it filed a protest last December. 
</P>
<P>
The contract is for a three-year base period and two one-year options to 
provide software services at the NASA/Ames Research Center in Mountain View, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling said the value of the five-year contact could be about $24 million for 
the first 12 months.

WARNER SHAREHOLDERS FILE SUIT TO BLOCK MERGER WITH TIME 
</P>

<P>
A group of Warner Communications Inc. stockholders charged in a lawsuit filed 
Wednesday in a Delaware court that a proposed merger with Time Inc. is an 
illegal scheme to block any outside takeover of Warner. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Warner and Time shares skidded as takeover talk dimmed. 
</P>
<P>
West German publisher Bertelsmann AG said it was not interested in seeking 
either Time or Warner, and industry analysts saw no other serious threats. In 
New York Stock Exchange trading, Time fell $1.875 to $114.875 and Warner 
declined $1.125 to $47.75 after rising in previous sessions on talk of outside 
offers emerging. 
</P>
<P>
The Warner shareholder suit, filed in Delaware's chancery court, seeks to block 
the companies from proceeding with a so-called lockup provision in which Time 
will exchange 12.5% of its stock for 12% of Warner's shares. 
</P>
<P>
The provision was part of the agreement under which Time and Warner plan to 
swap shares and merge into what would be the world's largest media and 
entertainment company, with a market value of $18 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Court records also showed that two more shareholder suits have been filed 
challenging the merger, including one naming Time and Warner and another naming 
just Warner. No other details were available immediately. The suits could later 
be consolidated. 
</P>
<P>
Time and Warner agreed to vote each other's shares in support of the merger or 
in case of a proxy fight for control of Warner. This, together with Warner 
director share holdings, would effectively block any outside takeover of 
Warner, the shareholders said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit charged that by blocking an outside takeover, Warner is preventing its 
stockholders from receiving a fair price for their shares. It noted that Time 
and Warner have each been a rumored takeover target in recent years and that it 
"is generally believed that (their) merger would make them a difficult takeover 
target." 
</P>
<P>
"The merger and lockup transactions are nothing more than a plan and scheme by 
the (Warner) director defendants to entrench themselves," argued the 
shareholders, Bernice Berger, Harold Sachs, Joseph Kovacs and Kathleen Pessin. 
</P>
<P>
The shareholders said in a 12-page court document that Time and Warner are 
"engaged in a conspiracy and are substantially and knowingly aiding and 
abetting each other in carrying out this unlawful scheme." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts had been predicting lawsuits because some shareholders were 
disappointed that a more lucrative offer did not emerge for either of the 
companies, whose underlying asset values are estimated at as much as twice 
their current stock market value. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the House Judiciary Committee announced that its 
subcommittee on economic and commercial law will hold a hearing on the proposed 
merger on Tuesday.

Southern whites who have been to college and now live in the suburbs of a small 
city are likely making the most progress in bettering their financial standing, 
a Census Bureau analysis indicated Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, white families increased their median income by 1.1% from 1986 to 
1987, while the incomes of black and Latino families slipped, according to the 
report "Money Income of Households, Families and Persons in the United States: 
1987." 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 median income of white families was $32,274, up from $31,935 a year 
earlier, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, median income for blacks was $18,098, down from $18,247. For 
Latinos, the median fell to $20,306 from $20,726, according to the study, an 
expanded version of an analysis released in August that found nearly one-third 
of all black Americans living in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
While the earlier report detailed the poverty status of various segments of 
society, the new edition contains extensive detail on income for differing 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
Among family groups, the highest incomes were reported for white married 
couples at $35,295, up from $34,647. Black married couples saw their median 
income fall from $27,554 to $27,182; for Latino couples, the figure dropped 
from $24,786 to $24,677. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some College Helped 
</P>
<P>
White families maintained by a woman with no husband present had an income 
increase from $16,290 to $17,018. 
</P>
<P>
Black female heads of households reported an increase from $9,640 to $9,710. 
Among Latinos, the median for this group edged up from $9,777 to $9,805. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest income gain by education was for people with from one to three 
years of college. Families headed by people in this category saw their incomes 
rise from $35,455 to $36,392. 
</P>
<P>
Ranked by education, families headed by people with more than five years of 
college still had the highest income at $54,491, but that was down a bit, from 
$54,595. And for those with four years of college, income fell from $47,269 to 
$46,533. 
</P>
<P>
High school graduates saw an 0.6% increase from $29,765 to $29,937, while 
income for families headed by those with some high school education climbed 
from $20,854 to $21,265. Family income for those with no high school education 
fell from $14,616 to $14,547. 
</P>
<P>
Regionally, Southerners led in income gains, with median family income rising 
from $27,684 to $28,250, up 2%. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having the largest gain, Southerners continue to have the nation's 
lowest median income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drop in Inner Cities 
</P>
<P>
In the Northeast, the rise was 1.8%, from $33,335 to $33,938, and, in the 
Midwest, 1.1%, from $30,665 to $30,991. In the West, median income slipped 0.2% 
from $32,096 to $32,026. 
</P>
<P>
By residence, the greatest gain was 3.6% for families living in the suburbs of 
cities with less than 1 million people. Their income rose from $32,034 to 
$33,192. 
</P>
<P>
Rural residents were next, increasing their incomes 1.3%, from $24,078 to 
$24,397. Large-city suburbanites had income growth of 1.1% from $39,850 to 
$40,270. 
</P>
<P>
Inner-city residents of large cities had an income drop from $27,654 to 
$27,458, while families in smaller inner cities saw their income dip from 
$27,614 to $27,294.

DEMAND FOR CHIPS LEAPS IN FEBRUARY

The Semiconductor Industry Assn., an industry group, said Wednesday that its 
closely watched index of new orders for computer chips rose sharply last month. 
</P>
<P>
The group said the February book-to-bill ratio, which measures the rate of new 
orders against shipments to fulfill old orders, rose to 1.07 from 1.00 in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the February figure "fantastic," Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Michael 
Gumport said the ratio could reach as high as 1.20 in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Appears Healthy' 
</P>
<P>
Goldman Sachs computer chip analyst Rajiv Chaudri said the February figure 
indicates that the industry's buildup in inventories may be over. 
</P>
<P>
"(The February ratio) is a very solid number, a very high quality number. It 
says the inventory correction the industry was experiencing appears to be over 
now and end-demand for chips appears to be healthy," Chaudri said. 
</P>
<P>
Average monthly orders, for the three-month period ending in February totaled 
$1.24 billion, 10.6% above the figure for January, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
The average billings for the three-month period were just under $1.17 billion 
to produce a book-to-bill ratio of 1.07.

MOTOROLA SET TO RE-ENTER CHIP MARKET AFTER 4-YEAR ABSENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Motorola, one of five U.S. semiconductor makers that stopped making the memory 
chips nearly four years ago because of Japanese competition, has started pilot 
production at its once-idled Phoenix plant -- the first of the five to return 
to the market. 
</P>
<P>
The Schaumburg, Ill.-based communications and electronics company, which 
shuttered the plant in 1985, has begun producing one-megabit dynamic random 
access memories, or DRAMs. These are the tiny slices of silicon used to store 
data in most electronic devices, from personal computers to toasters to weapons 
systems. One-megabit chips are capable of storing 1 million bits of data. 
</P>
<P>
The company is now the third U.S. maker of DRAMs, along with Texas Instruments 
in Dallas and Micron Technology in Boise, Ida., which never stopped 
manufacturing the chips. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola, along with four other U.S. chip makers, pulled out of the DRAM market 
in 1985 amid charges that their Japanese competitors had artificially depressed 
prices for the devices by dumping huge quantities of them on the U.S. market. 
Of the five companies that abandoned the market that year, Motorola is the only 
one -- so far -- to return. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the DRAM market has become more attractive to U.S. semiconductor 
makers because they are increasingly viewing the DRAM as a fundamental 
component of a complete product line. Equally important, a 1986 trade agreement 
with the Japanese stabilized prices for the chips. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Venture Will Continue 
</P>
<P>
Semiconductor industry sources say that other U.S. chip makers are studying the 
market and may be poised to re-enter. Last week, the Semiconductor Industry 
Assn. said it was developing plans to re-establish large-scale U.S. production 
of DRAMs. Also, a small Silicon Valley firm, Alliance Semiconductor, has said 
it will begin producing semiconductors at an abandoned American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph plant in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Production at Motorola's Phoenix facility is still in the test phase, but 
shipments to customers will begin later this year. The company also plans to 
start shipments to its European customers of one megabit DRAMs from a plant in 
Scotland later this year.

NEWBORN LEFT OUTSIDE HOSPITAL WITH DIAPERS, MONEY AND NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A newborn boy was found outside a community hospital in Mission Viejo this 
morning with a bag full of diapers, a $20 bill and a note saying, "Hi, my name 
is Brett. Please find me a good home." 
</P>
<P>
Suma Nassef, a medical assistant at the Saddleback Urgent Care Center on Alicia 
Parkway, discovered the baby about 7:15 a.m. when she arrived for work. 
</P>
<P>
"The baby was wrapped in a towel and its face was covered," Nassef said. "I 
think he heard my keys and started crying," she said. "That's when I noticed 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still in shock. I can't believe it," she said. "I thought this only 
happened in the movies." 
</P>
<P>
The baby's umbilical cord was still attached, so "it's probably just a couple 
of days old," said Teresa Bibler, center director. 
</P>
<P>
The infant was examined at the center and appeared to be in good health. The 
9-pound child, described as white with brown hair and brown eyes, is being 
cared for at Orangewood Children's Foundation in Orange.

Dist. Atty. Ronald Tepper of El Dorado County was found shot to death in his 
downtown office today and Placerville Police Chief Bob Harmon said the 
prosecutor committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Tepper, 54, was found with a head wound by a district attorney's investigator. 
There was no note explaining the shooting, Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
Tepper, who was married, had been involved lately in the prosecution of El 
Dorado County Supervisor Michael Visman, who was to be arraigned in U.S. 
District Court in Sacramento later today on marijuana cultivation charges. 
Tepper asked to have the trial shifted from the county to U.S. District Court 
after a challenge to his prosecution of the case. Visman's attorney charged 
that Tepper had a longstanding grudge against his client. He said Tepper 
insisted on going through with a court hearing to review evidence in the case 
to further damage Visman.

EASTERN FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY; 
</P>
<P>
STRUCK AIRLINE DENIES MOVE IS 'A DEATH WARRANT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Eastern Airlines filed for protection from creditors in bankruptcy court today, 
on the sixth day of a bitter strike by machinists that virtually shut down the 
nation's seventh-largest carrier and cost it up to $7 million a day. 
</P>
<P>
The filing under Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York is designed to 
give tottering Eastern a reprieve from bills and debts while it tries to 
restructure and extricate itself from the worst crisis in the history of the 
60-year-old airline. 
</P>
<P>
"The bankruptcy process will assist Eastern in rebuilding itself," Eastern 
President Phil Bakes told a packed and tense news conference. "We shouldn't 
look at this as a death warrant for Eastern," he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo 'Hurt' 
</P>
<P>
Eastern boss Frank Lorenzo said the animosity many union leaders have expressed 
toward him have "hurt my family and me." 
</P>
<P>
"But I suggest that the intensive focus on a single person does a real gross 
injustice to the real issues that are at stake in airline deregulation and, 
indeed, in our business climate today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is fundamentally whether a troubled and sick business in a 
competitive marketplace should be allowed to change itself and manage its 
survival for the benefit of all its constituencies, its employees and their 
families, its suppliers, its investors, the communities we serve and, of 
course, the traveling public and our customers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the machinists' union at Eastern, Charles Bryan, said in Miami: 
"Frank Lorenzo did not bring anything into the airline industry, Frank Lorenzo 
has extracted everything he has, his fortune, from the backs and the suffering 
of thousands and thousands of employees throughout the airline industry." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's labor leaders said they believed that Lorenzo would try to use the 
protection of bankruptcy proceedings to break the unions. Lorenzo earned the 
hatred of organized labor when he took Continental Airlines into bankruptcy in 
1983, threw out its union contracts and revived the carrier as a non-union 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air Corp., would have a 
tougher time imposing lower wages on the unions than he did when he reorganized 
Continental. Congress amended federal laws in 1984 to require bankrupt 
companies to negotiate with unions and prove economic necessity before 
abrogating their contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo denied today that bankruptcy is part of a plan to break the unions. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought we would be here today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern, running just 4% of its flights with a skeleton crew of 1,500, had 
warned that it could end up in bankruptcy court by week's end if pilots 
continued to honor picket lines. Analysts' estimates of the carrier's daily 
losses have ranged from $2 million to $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Bakes said Eastern faces a "cash crisis that can only be averted and stabilized 
by" turning to the bankruptcy court. But he said the airline intended to 
continue to operate and to "prudently but unmistakably" restore routes as its 
financial situation is resolved.

STATE SENATE PASSES NEAR BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS

The state Senate approved a bill today that would virtually ban the sale and 
possession of assault weapons, with supporters pleading for action against 
heavily armed street gangs and critics calling the bill a violation of gun 
owners' rights. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted 27 to 12 to send the bill by Senate President Pro Tem David 
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) to the Assembly, where its fate is uncertain. The 
bipartisan vote, which easily surpassed the simple majority vote of 21 that was 
needed for passage, followed about an hour of debate. 
</P>
<P>
"I work in a district and live in a district where we are under siege" by 
street gangs and drug runners, said Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles). "What is 
prevailing is the law of the gun." 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of the bill said it would infringe the right of law-abiding 
citizens to bear arms. They called instead for tougher laws against criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"There's 1 million people who protected themselves from being a victim of a 
crime because they have a right to keep and use the weapon of their choice," 
said Sen. Don Rogers (R-Bakersfield). 
</P>
<P>
Roberti said his bill would not prevent hunters from using legitimate sporting 
weapons, and accused the National Rifle Assn. of lying to its members about the 
legislation's intent. 
</P>
<P>
He called the measure "rational public policy" and likened it to laws passed by 
state legislatures to ban machine guns used by gangs 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A similar bill, which virtually bans four dozen specific models of assault 
weapons, has reached the floor of the Assembly.

U.S. ACCUSES SOVIET DIPLOMAT OF SPYING, ORDERS HIM TO LEAVE;

The United States today accused a Soviet diplomat of spying and ordered him out 
of the country, the State Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Charles E. Redman said Yuri Nikolayevich Pakhtusov, a member of the 
Soviet military mission, "has been declared persona non grata for engaging in 
activities incompatible with his diplomatic status," a diplomatic term for 
spying. 
</P>
<P>
Redman said Pakhtusov "received classified documents from an American employee 
of a firm with classified government contracts" but declined to identify either 
the American or the company. 
</P>
<P>
The documents "dealt with how the U.S. government protects classified and other 
sensitive information contained in its computer systems," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI said Pakhtusov was arrested Wednesday before he had a chance to examine 
the classified documents. It was not disclosed how long he is being given to 
leave the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FBI Informed 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Dennis Harter said Pakhtusov approached the American 
last August and asked about the possibility of acquiring the secret documents. 
The American reported the contact to the FBI, which began monitoring contacts 
between the two. 
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman Nik Walsh said the case had no connection with the arrest last 
week of several West German computer "hackers" accused of selling codes to 
Soviet intelligence agents that would permit entry into Defense Department 
computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
Although the FBI routinely conducts surveillance of Soviet diplomats stationed 
in this country, it is rare when the United States makes public any accusations 
of spying. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Embassy was not immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The last time a Soviet official was expelled from the United States for alleged 
spying was on June 20, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI at the time said that Vladimir Izmaylou, an air attache at the Soviet 
Embassy in Washington, had been caught trying to steal top military secrets 
from a U.S. military officer posing as a traitor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Improved Relations 
</P>
<P>
The latest incident occurs during a period of dramatically improved U.S.-Soviet 
relations in arms control, human rights and regional cooperation, and it was 
uncertain how much this case might sour the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III just met Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard 
A. Shevardnadze in Vienna this week for their first formal meeting since Baker 
came to office.

Kitty Dukakis, wife of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, said today that she continues

"I am an alcoholic," she told the media at a news conference attended by her

center will encourage others to follow her route. "I would have preferred to 
deal with my private trouble in private," she said, acknowledging that was not 
possible as the wife of Massachusetts' governor. "One of the mysteries of this 
disease is that you can have a loving family, a network of caring friends and 
still face recovery every day," she said, asking that she be afforded some 
privacy during the fight. 
</P>

She returned home Tuesday after spending 31 days at Edgehill Newport, a private

Atari Corp., the video game and computer maker, reported a third-quarter net 
loss of $97 million largely because of its ailing subsidiary, the Federated 
Group. In an effort to stem its losses, Atari announced that it would begin 
treating the Federated Group as a discontinued operation. Atari also said it 
was considering its possible sale, spinoff or leveraged buyout. The Federated 
Group, a chain of about 50 retail electronics stores, suffered a third-quarter 
loss of $106.3 million and a year-end loss of $124.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Atari's third-quarter net income loss of $97 million, a loss of $1.67 per 
share, compared to a profit of $18.7 million, or 32 cents per share, in the 
same period in 1987. For the year, it lost $84.8 million loss, a loss of $1.46 
per share, contrasted with a gain of $57.4 million, or 76 cents per share, in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
In the report released Wednesday, Atari said net sales in the third quarter 
totaled $152.6 million, compared to $146.4 million in the same period of 1987. 
For 1988, the company had sales of $452.2 million, compared to $362.6 million 
the previous year.

CHINA TO HELP BOOST OIL PRICES

China said today it will cut oil exports by 5% in the second quarter of this 
year to help boost world oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
The official New China News Agency quoted Zheng Dunxun, head of the state oil 
trading arm, China National Chemicals Import &amp; Export Corp., as saying the 
move was designed to help the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
restore prices to the group's target of $18 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Technical experts from China and five other oil-producing nations outside OPEC 
proposed at a meeting in London last month to try to bolster prices by 
tightening output. The five other non-OPEC producers are Egypt, Oman, North 
Yemen, Mexico and Malaysia. The Soviet Union, which attended the London meeting 
as an observer, said last Friday it is cutting its hard-currency exports by 5% 
in the first half of 1989 to support the price strategy. 
</P>
<P>
China did not give a precise target for the second quarter, but it exported 26 
million metric tons of oil -- about 162 million barrels -- in all of 1988, a 
drop of more than 4% from the previous year.

Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita today proposed banning stock trading 
by Cabinet members and requiring regular disclosure of their assets during 
their tenure, government spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita submitted the proposals to a private group of advisers and also 
suggested ministers keep their shares in a blind trust. At present, ministers 
are allowed to deal in stocks, and must disclose their assets only once at the 
time of appointment. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals come as the Takeshita government is embroiled in an insider 
trading scandal involving pre-listed shares in a subsidiary of Recruit Co. More 
than a dozen politicians and businessmen have been arrested on bribery charges 
in the case.

With little debate, the Tennessee House voted 95 to 0 today for a bill to 
establish a jail term of up to six months for assaulting a referee or umpire at 
a sports event. The bill is designed to allow schools to prosecute unruly fans 
if the official is not available to file charges. The measure is sponsored by 
Rep. Tommy Head (D-Clarksville). His sister, Pat Head Summitt, is coach of the 
Lady Vols basketball team at the University of Tennessee.

BENGALS' WILSON IN DRUG CLINIC AGAIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Cincinnati Bengals say they are paying for another drug rehabilitation 
program for suspended fullback Stanley Wilson, who still awaits word from the 
National Football League on whether he will ever be allowed to play in the NFL 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, 27, a former University of Oklahoma star from Carson, checked into a 
drug rehabilitation clinic in Inglewood on March 1, said Mike Brown, the 
Bengals' assistant general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said Wilson was due to stay at the clinic for a week to 10 days and was 
being treated as an in-patient. The Bengals are paying the cost of Wilson's 
stay at the clinic through an insurance policy, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Bengals general manager Paul Brown has said his team has no further plans for 
Wilson as a player. Wilson, a 1983 Bengals draftee, scored two touchdowns in 
the NFL playoffs but was suspended hours before the Bengals' Jan. 22 Super Bowl 
appearance in Miami because of evidence that he had relapsed into drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has asked the NFL to reinstate him. Commissioner Pete Rozelle has not 
announced his response. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL suspended Wilson for the 1985 and 1987 seasons because of cocaine use. 
The Bengals said the NFL told Wilson, when he was reinstated the last time in 
April, 1988, that it would be his last chance to stay drug-free if he wanted to 
continue playing in the league.

BRITAIN BANS BLOOD DOPING OF HORSES

Blood doping of racehorses will soon be banned in Britain, although officials 
said they have no evidence that the practice ever has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
The Jockey Club voted this week to outlaw blood doping beginning March 25, 
disqualifying a horse from starting "if he has received a blood transfusion for 
the purpose of enhancing his performance in that race." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said there have been persistent rumors of blood doping of horses. 
"There is no evidence of blood transfusions taking place," Jockey Club 
spokesman David Pipe said. "The security department has followed every bit of 
rumor and advice but has never found any evidence whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
Pipe said one of the main reasons for the new rule was to allay public concern 
and said it was not even clear that transfusions would help a horse perform 
better.

THE NEW: FITNESS AT 55 M.P.H. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You're stuck in rush-hour traffic on the Ventura Freeway. Your temper is rising 
along with your blood pressure. As someone cuts you off, you reflect that it's 
a good thing that the Los Angeles City Council just banned semiautomatic 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
You're ready for "Autorobics." 
</P>
<P>
"Autorobics" is a spiral-bound book that bills itself as "an exercise program 
for the daily commuter." The brainchild of Huntington Beach entrepreneur Larry 
Reynolds, the 52-page tome details 24 isometric exercises that can be done 
either while hurtling along Interstate 5 at 55 m.p.h. or languishing behind an 
overturned manure truck on State Highway 23. 
</P>
<P>
Each exercise (they range from "car squats" to "floorboard toe raisers") should 
be done three to five times for about 10 seconds each, Reynolds said. The 
entire workout takes about one hour, and the exercises actually tone and 
strengthen, in addition to reducing stress. 
</P>
<P>
"I got tired of being a car potato, of being on a freeway with absolutely 
nothing to do. This helps relieve a lot of tension," said Reynolds, who hit on 
the idea while stuck in traffic for three hours one memorable day. He enlisted 
the help of Newport Beach management consultant John Casella and Fresno sports 
medicine expert Charles Eldred and, presto, a book was born. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the California Highway Patrol looks askance at such exercises 
as "steering wheel curls" and "car sit-ups." 
</P>
<P>
"People have been involved in accidents combing their hair or drinking coffee," 
said CHP Officer Craig Strauch. "Anything that would require that you take one 
hand off the wheel is potentially dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds countered that each exercise can be safely accomplished while looking 
straight ahead and keeping one hand on the steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
"That's safer than talking into a car phone or looking in a rear-view mirror," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Reynolds added, "we're not telling them to do the exercises and run 
into a truck." 
</P>
<P>
"Autorobics," a paperback that costs $6.95, was released in January and is 
selling well although it hasn't made it into bookstores, Reynolds said. It can 
be ordered from Baker &amp; Taylor Co. in Reno, Nev., or through a bookstore.
