Bad words -- and a flashing knife -- involving two inner-city groups. 
</P>
<P>
Rival street gangs? No. Feuding members of the Rapid Transit District and the 
Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The two rivals gathered Thursday at an RTD board meeting to discuss the Long 
Beach-Los Angeles trolley line, which the commission is building and which the 
RTD will operate. The two differ on how it should be built and operated. 
</P>
<P>
Shown a sample of a cloth-covered foam seat that the commission has chosen to 
use in the trolleys, RTD board member Nick Patsaouras pulled out a knife and 
slashed the cushion open. This latest dig was his subtle way of showing that 
the pad isn't vandal-proof. 
</P>
<P>
Later, when commission members said they planned to use a "graffiti-resistant" 
paint for the trolley exteriors, RTD forces argued that it is "essentially the 
same" type of paint now used on RTD buses. And RTD buses aren't exactly immune 
to spray paint. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have problems (with the paint)," warned RTD official Rich 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The trolley exteriors didn't get the knife test, however. 
</P>
<P>
On Oscar night, the tension will be building over which nominees, if any, show 
up. 
</P>
<P>
The nominees, that is, for worst achievements in film. Those awards, plastic 
raspberries called Razzies, will be handed out in a rival ceremony March 29 at 
the Palace. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to see Sly," says writer John Wilson, who founded the Oscar parody. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sylvester Stallone, a two-time Razzie winner going for his third Worst 
Actor award for "Rambo III," is not expected to appear. In fact, in the 
Razzies' eight years, no nominee has ever shown up. 
</P>
<P>
But versatile Bill Cosby, a three-Razzie winner for "Leonard, Part Six" last 
year, did later make a good-natured exception to his no-awards-accepted policy. 
He collected his Razzies between shows at Harrah's resort in Lake Tahoe. No 
word on whether Cosby will hand out the Worst Actor award this year. 
</P>
<P>
It was a situation hardly befitting the dignity of the Hermosa Friends of the 
Arts Poetry Reading Series. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, a woman with numerous gentlemen friends left her name with a referral 
service, but in doing so, transposed a couple of numbers. Suddenly, the Friends 
began receiving calls at all hours from inquisitive men. 
</P>
<P>
Hence, the new recorded message on the phone machine of the Hermosa Poetry 
Reading Series: "Please do not leave any messages for Tanya. There is no one 
named Tanya at this number." 
</P>
<P>
With rumors circulating that the newspaper might be purchased by the Toronto 
Sun, Don Rosen, a reporter at the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, suddenly 
launched into a semi-striptease in the City Room to the whistles and groans of 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, what the hell, I might as well volunteer to be the first 'SUN-shine 
Boy,' " said Rosen, referring to the Canadian tabloid's daily photo spreads of 
scantily clad men and women. 
</P>
<P>
In the alphabet-soup world of radio, station KNX-FM recently switched to an 
oldies format and rechristened itself KODJ -- "O" for oldies, "DJ" for disc 
jockeys. The station is following the current trend of choosing call letters 
that symbolize a format, in the manner of KROQ (rock) and KLSX (classics). 
</P>
<P>
The call letters of older stations, however, have more mysterious origins. 
</P>
<P>
Some bear their original owners' initials -- KMPC (MacMillan Petroleum Co.), 
KFWB (Fox-Warner Brothers), now-defunct KECA (Earle C. Anthony) and KJLH-FM 
(John Lamar Hill III, whose first studio was in a Long Beach mortuary). 
</P>
<P>
Others are acronyms: KFI (Farm Information), KHJ (Kindness, Happiness and Joy), 
and KCRW-FM (College Radio Workshop or Corsair Radio West -- "I've heard two 
versions of the origin," said spokeswoman Sarah Spitz. KGFJ is short for 
Keeping Good Folks Joyful, said music director John Morris, a reference to the 
fact it was one of the first 24-hour stations. 
</P>
<P>
And, 68-year-old KNX-AM, the oldest local broadcaster of all? "The letters go 
back so far that no one around here seems to know," said spokesman Fred 
Bergendorff.

NEED FOR NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congratulations for your editorial. You are so correct, and the public does not 
realize that companies cannot drill and produce oil in a short period of time. 
I believe it was something like 10 years before Exxon was able to produce oil 
from the Santa Barbara area after the discovery. And still everyone says "don't 
drill off our shores." Anyone who has driven along the coast highway can attest 
to the fact that there is nothing unsightly about the platforms out there. And 
it is a proven fact, from the gulf areas, that the best fishing is near and 
around the producing platforms. 
</P>
<P>
People should be made to understand that it is in the interest of our national 
security to find as much oil as possible, and all geologist think that the best 
chances to find something big lie off the California and northern Alaska 
coasts.

BUYOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Morris' thoughtful column on leveraged buyouts (Opinion, Feb. 26) did 
not mention that most LBOs involve privately held companies. 
</P>
<P>
Each year an uncounted number of these companies pass from one owner to the 
next thanks to LBO financing. Generally, there are neither superfluous 
operations that can be sold to pay down debt nor a legion or unnecessary 
employees that can be dismissed to increase cash flow. Thus, even though the 
financing is secured by the company's assets, lenders won't provide funding 
unless the buyer can show that the resulting company can continue as an ongoing 
business. As a result, these private deals must be priced very conservatively. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative to most private LBOs is for the owner (often nearing retirement 
age) to close the company, fire its employees, and sell its machinery, real 
estate and account list. But a leveraged buyout saves the company -- as well as 
the jobs and the output of goods and services it provides. Properly structured, 
an LBO will enable the company to remain viable despite rising interest rates 
or slowdowns in the economy.

FANG LIZHI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a Chinese student studying here, I am greatly disturbed by the incident of 
Prof. Fang Lizhi, the prominent Chinese dissident astrophysicist, being blocked 
by the Chinese police from attending President George Bush's banquet on his 
invitation (Part I, Feb. 27; editorial, "The Missing Guest," Feb. 28). 
</P>
<P>
The obviously politically motivated obstruction not only violates Prof. Fang's 
basic human rights, it may also alarm and alienate many Chinese students here. 
Largely identified with Fang's honest and outspoken ideas, hundreds and 
thousands of them have signed letters to support him. Now his humiliation 
clearly sends a chilling signal to those of us who plan to return that 
political freedom and tolerance are still very limited there. If these students 
choose to speak their minds as Fang is doing back in China, it is very likely 
that they will face the same threat of jeopardizing their career and even 
personal freedom.

Our Hollywood Chamber of Commerce is wasting money and time. Ninety-nine and 
forty-four one-hundredths percent of the world think only of California's 
Hollywood, no matter where they might see the name.

Any other state using the name is simply providing free publicity for what the

A LIVING WAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A move to raise the minimum wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.65 an hour is gaining 
momentum in Congress. That a vote could come in the Senate as early as next 
week is encouraging news for the working poor. Despite repeated efforts by 
Democrats, employees earning the legal minimum -- except for those in 
California and six other states -- have worked at the same low wages for eight 
years. A decent pay raise is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
At least one major stumbling block has been removed. President Bush -- unlike 
his predecessor -- is willing to support an increase to $4.25 an hour, the 
present rate in California. That meager increase would be better than none, but 
it would not even make up for the 30% loss in buying power that inflation has 
imposed on minimum-wage earners since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
To make any raise more palatable to business, which traditionally opposes any 
increase at all on the unproven ground that it causes unemployment, Bush also 
supports a lower "training" wage of $3.35 an hour for six months for new 
workers. A sub-minimum wage is a troubling notion, because the lower rate could 
encourage employers to replace adults with younger and cheaper labor. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Democrats have rejected Bush's new minimum wage in favor of a sounder 
proposal by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) that would raise the minimum wage 
to $4.65 an hour. The higher rate would be just enough to make up for 
inflation. It would go up in stages -- 40 cents when the bill becomes law, an 
additional 40 cents next Jan. 1 and another 50 cents on the first day of 1991. 
The gradual increase would give employers time to prepare for the higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats say they will drop their opposition to a sub-minimum wage if it 
includes an educational component and lasts only for the time it takes to train 
a new worker -- often as little as a month, according to the U.S. Department of 
Labor. That seems fair. 
</P>
<P>
While the Senate is expected to take up Kennedy's bill sometime next week, an 
identical proposal will go before the House Education and Labor Committee 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Five million Americans earn the minimum wage of $3.35 an hour. At least 1 
million of them are heads of impoverished households. Their paychecks stay the 
same -- $134 a week -- no matter how high prices rise and no matter how well 
they perform their jobs. They earn slightly less than $6,900 a year, which is 
below the poverty line for all families except a single parent and two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Congress and a compassionate President ought to do better by Americans who are 
willing to work hard for the nation's lowest wage.

MORNING BRIEFING: SOMETIMES, TOO MANY COOKS SPOIL ANYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Would-be stand-up comic Norman Chad, currently making ends meet as a Washington 
Post sports television columnist, has done the world a (dis)service by 
collecting one-liners delivered by ESPN football commentator Beano Cook. 
</P>
<P>
Herewith, a sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Twenty years from now, this place (ESPN) is gonna be a rats' nest. And 
I'll be dead, but unlike Brent Musburger, I won't be expected back in five 
days." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "I worry about these people whose biggest thing in life is following high 
school prospects. They indeed lead a life of quiet desperation." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "You only have to bat a thousand in two things -- flying and heart 
transplants. Everything else, you can go four for five." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: The Calgary Flames' Lanny McDonald this week became the 23rd 
player in NHL history to reach the 1,000-point mark. Who was the first? 
</P>
<P>
Punch and Gary: After taking that celebrated swing at teammate Keith Hernandez 
during a photo session last week, the New York Mets' Darryl Strawberry 
supposedly glared at catcher Gary Carter and said: "You're next." 
</P>
<P>
And what does Carter think about that? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hear him," Carter told Claire Smith of the Hartford Courant. "If I 
did, I would have just waved him off. But I was too busy jumping in front of 
the cameras, saying, 'Come on, guys, you don't need to shoot this stuff.' I 
heard nothing but clicks . . . I felt like I was in the Japanese embassy. 
</P>
<P>
"It was only talk (from Strawberry). If he'd swung at me, he would have had to 
put me down for good, though." 
</P>
<P>
Add Carter: Although Carter might be concerned about his less than stellar 
season in 1988, New York management apparently is not. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by the cool reaction the Mets gave to San Diego's suggestion that they 
might like to look at minor league catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., Carter's job is 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite what everyone reads in the papers, our reports (on Alomar) do not 
indicate that he is Moses incarnate," said Mets Vice President Joe McIlvaine. 
</P>
<P>
Perceptive: CBS commentator Billy Packer, on the upcoming NCAA basketball 
tournament: 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of teams that can win a couple of games, but there aren't many 
who can win it all." 
</P>
<P>
Only one, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
Chair man of the boards: Indiana Coach Bobby Knight says he can't understand 
why more attention is paid to him than to the average basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
"What difference does it make who it is? How many coaches have kicked chairs, 
thrown chairs, thrown jackets?" he asked the Washington Post's Anthony Cotton. 
"Why is it me? If I threw 500 chairs in 900 games, that would be one thing, but 
I've thrown one and now I'm the chair-thrower. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Add Knight: "It seems to me that pounding on a table pales in significance to 
97% of our players graduating. How many stories are written -- not about 
academics -- where somewhere there's a line that says, 'By the way, Coach Jones 
has graduated only 20% of his players in the last 10 years?' 
</P>
<P>
"You'll never see it, but to me, that should be the same as sticking in a line 
that says I threw a chair." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Gordie Howe of Detroit, who reached that mark on Nov. 27 1960. 
</P>
<P>

One of the old gems from broadcaster Jerry Coleman: "There's a fly to deep

It's rolling toward second base."

Top-seeded Ivan Lendl and fifth-seeded Emilio Sanchez both breezed into the 
quarterfinals Thursday night in the $415,000 Eagle tennis tournament, while 
Yugoslavian teen-ager Goran Ivanisevic upset eighth-seeded Andrei Chesnokov of 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, the No. 1-ranked men's player in the world, needed just 69 minutes to 
eliminate South Africa's Christo van Rensburg, 6-0, 6-2, in their second-round 
match. 
</P>
<P>
Van Rensburg, ranked 37th in the world, won only six points in the first set. 
</P>
<P>
"If tonight is any indication, I'm hitting the ball quite well," said Lendl, 
who defeated Paul Annacone, 6-2, 6-4, in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, a Spaniard ranked 17th in the world, beat Australia's Mark Woodforde, 
6-3, 6-3, in a 68-minute match. 
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Jim Courier, 18, eliminated 30-year-old Johan Kriek, 6-1, 6-1, in 
another second-round match on the hardcourts of the Scottsdale Princess resort 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Kriek, a South African ranked 39th in the world but unseeded here, had ousted 
third-seeded Jimmy Connors, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the big winner Thursday was Ivanisevic, 17, ranked 119th in the world. 
He beat the 19th-ranked Chesnokov, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic blew a 4-1 lead in the first set but came back to score what he 
called the biggest victory of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"The first set, I was up 4-1 and then I started to hurry," Ivanisevic said. 
"Every backhand that I hit was out. Then I started serving bad and lost some 
games. In the second and third sets, I played not too bad."

Loren Roberts battled cold and wind for a five-under-par 66 and a one-stroke 
lead Thursday in the first round of the $800,000 Nestle Invitational golf 
tournament at Bay Hill Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions were miserable. 
</P>
<P>
"The coldest it's been this year," Roberts said. And most agreed that, overall, 
this winter has been the coldest start to the PGA Tour within memory. 
</P>
<P>
"By far the worst I've been in this year," Ted Schulz said. 
</P>
<P>
"The coldest I remember in a long time," Tom Kite added. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Price, wearing gloves, a ski cap and five layers of clothing over his 
upper body, said nothing. He just shivered, but birdied the final three holes 
for a 67. 
</P>
<P>
The temperatures reached only into the low 40s. A brisk wind reduced the chill 
factor to 25. Mist and fog rose from the lakes and ponds dotting the course and 
obscured some fairways. 
</P>
<P>
Kite holed a 173-yard, 6-iron shot for an eagle-2 on the 16th hole and was tied 
at 68 with Schulz and Tom Purtzer. 
</P>
<P>
Don Pooley, Steve Pate and John Huston were next at 69.

STEINLEN EQUALS TURF RECORD AT SANTA ANITA

Steinlen, making his first start since finishing second in the Breeders' Cup 
Turf race behind 1988 champion turf filly Miesque in November, withstood the 
challenge of Peace to win the $60,000 Project Hope Purse at Santa Anita 
Thursday. 
</P>

Chris Chelios, Russ Courtnall and Brian Skrudland scored third-period goals as 
the Montreal Canadiens clinched the Adams Division title with a 5-2 victory 
over the Quebec Nordiques Thursday night at Quebec City. 
</P>
<P>
Chelios broke a 2-2 tie at 6:11 of the third period when he put in Bobby 
Smith's rebound for his 14th goal. Courtnall added a goal at 17:28, and 
Skrudland connected 46 seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the Canadiens 101 points in 70 games, tops in the league and 
27 more than the division's second-place team, Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 3, N.Y. Rangers 2 -- Steve Chiasson and Shawn Burr scored eight seconds 
apart in the third period to lift the Red Wings to the win at Detroit, 
extending the Rangers' losing streak to four. 
</P>
<P>
After the Rangers' Carey Wilson snapped a 1-1 tie 44 seconds into the final 
period, New York's Lucien DeBlois was penalized for holding Steve Yzerman. 
Chiasson converted the power play by taking a pass from Adam Oates at the left 
point and beating goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck with a low slap shot. 
</P>
<P>
On the ensuing faceoff, Petr Klima carried the puck into the New York zone and 
fed a cross-ice pass to Dave Barr. Barr slid a pass across the goalmouth, and 
Burr tipped the puck into the net to give Detroit the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 7, Boston 2 -- Geoff Courtnall had three goals against his former 
team, and the Capitals scored four times in the first period, twice during a 
five-minute power play, to win at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The loss ended the Bruins' undefeated streak at nine games as the Capitals gave 
goalie Andy Moog his first loss after four straight wins. 
</P>
<P>
N.Y. Islanders 4, Philadelphia 4 -- Tim Kerr scored from a scramble in front 
with four seconds remaining in regulation to give the Flyers the tie at 
Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders led, 4-2, after Gerald Diduck's power-play goal at 5:54 of the 
third period. But Rick Tocchet scored at 12:16, and Kerr scored at 19:56. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers, who are 0-2-3 in their last five games, moved eight points ahead of 
New Jersey in the race for the final Patrick Division playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 4, Toronto 1 -- Bernie Federko scored for the eighth time in his last 
six games as the second-place Blues won at St. Louis and moved three points 
ahead of idle Chicago in the Norris Division. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Hull, Greg Paslawski and Cliff Ronning also scored for St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 10, Pittsburgh 3 -- Joe Nieuwendyk and Hakan Loob each scored twice as 
the Flames won easily at Calgary, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Nieuwendyk also had three assists, while Joey Mullen contributed a goal and 
four assists. Jiri Hrdina had a goal and two assists as the Flames reached the 
100-point mark for the second straight season. They are one point behind 
Montreal in the overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Errey scored on a center-ice slap shot 1:08 into the game for the Penguins, 
but the Flames scored the next nine goals.

BRUINS DRAW A TEAM THEY CAN BEAT

<P>
Washington, already devoured twice by UCLA this season, will be served up to 
the Bruins again at 9 tonight in the quarterfinals of the Pacific 10 Conference 
basketball tournament at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
That's bad news for Washington Coach Andy Russo, whose job is thought to be in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (19-8) isn't the only team that has carved up the Huskies. Washington 
(12-15) has lost nine games by 14 or more points, among them a 55-point rout by 
Arizona, a 40-point defeat by Oregon State and 19- and 23-point beatings by 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA guard Pooh Richardson has been especially effective against Washington, 
averaging 20 points and 11.5 assists a game while making 62.5% of his shots.

COUGARS BEAT DUCKS, 78-56, MUST FACE ARIZONA TODAY

<P>
Washington State dispatched Oregon, 78-56, Thursday night in the opening round 
of the Pacific 10 basketball tournament at the Forum to earn the right to play 
No. 1-ranked Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars may feel like sacrificial lambs for the Wildcats in today's 
quarterfinal game at3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we played great," WSU Coach Kelvin Sampson said. "I think Washington 
State is playing its best basketball. Tomorrow (today) is March 10, and in the 
minds of 99.9% of the people in this country, our season will end on March 10. 
That doesn't matter to us. 
</P>
<P>
"This team is playing as well as it can play. As far as Arizona is concerned, 
maybe that's not good enough." 
</P>
<P>
But it was good enough to beat Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Brian Quinnett scored 18 points, all in the first half, as the Cougars 
cruised past the Ducks. Quinnett left the game after picking up his fourth foul 
with 13:15 remaining in the second half and sat on the bench for almost 10 
minutes before returning. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Quinnett came back with 3:38 left, the Cougars had the game safely 
in hand. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Brian Wright and guard Harold Wright added 14 points each for WSU. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State is 10-18 overall. Oregon, which lost its last nine games, 
finished the season with an 8-21 record. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the mental toughness has kind of gone out of us," Oregon Coach Don 
Monson said. "We just don't seem to get over the hump." 
</P>
<P>
Forward Randy Grant led the Ducks with 23 points.

GAUCHOS GET HAT TRICK, DEFEATING 49ERS FOR THIRD TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
UC Santa Barbara disproved the theory that the odds are often against a team 
trying to beat another for the third time in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos, who had defeated Cal State Long Beach by 1 point and 11 points 
during the regular season, eliminated the 49ers from the Big West Conference 
tournament, 69-57, Thursday afternoon at the Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jerry Pimm, whose team improved to 21-7, didn't believe the theory, 
anyway. "It really didn't go through our minds," he said. "You just line up and 
play hard. I felt our preparation was solid." 
</P>
<P>
Both teams concentrated on working the ball inside. The Gauchos, who shot 55%, 
had an easy time doing that. The 49ers, who shot 43%, had a hard time. 
</P>
<P>
"We got the ball inside pretty good; that's the key for us," Pimm said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara took control of the game midway through the first half. In six 
minutes, the Gauchos went from a 17-14 deficit to a 30-19 lead. Eric McArthur 
scored nine points and Mike Doyle five during that run, which was aided by a 
technical foul on Long Beach Coach Joe Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, who finished the season 13-15, trailed at halftime, 38-29. But a 
series of power moves by reserve center Marco Fleming helped cut the lead to 
44-41 six minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Carrick DeHart came back with a baseline jumper for the Gauchos, and after 
Bobby Sears scored for Long Beach, DeHart hit from the wing for a five-point 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
Saved from danger momentarily, the Gauchos pulled away quickly. Frank Johnson 
converted a rebound into a basket. Doyle made a layup after breaking the 
all-court press. Doyle fed Lucius Davis for a lay-in, then scored inside 
himself. A three-point play by DeHart topped off the surge. 
</P>
<P>
The score was 59-48 with 6:02 to play, and Harrington conceded. "With six 
minutes to go, we started preparing for next season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming led all scorers with 20 points.

Tracy Murray scored a game-high 31 points, including all 11 of his team's 
points in the third quarter, to lead Glendora High School to a 52-46 win over 
San Bernardino Thursday night in the semifinals of the Southern California 
Regional Division II playoffs at UC Irvine before a crowd of 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, a 6-8 senior considered one of the top college prospects in the nation, 
made 13 of 25 field-goal attempts, grabbed 12 rebounds and blocked seven shots. 
Murray also hit three of seven shots from three-point range, had five assists 
and made five steals. 
</P>
<P>
For Glendora (30-2), the win made up for last week's 72-69 loss to San 
Bernardino in the Southern Section Division 4-AA final. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino (31-1) closed within 34-32 with 1:59 left in the third quarter 
but was never able to come closer. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Allan Thompson added 12 points for Glendora, which will play Dominguez 
of Compton in the Division II final Saturday at 5 p.m. at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Bryon Russell led San Bernardino with 17 points. STEVEN FLEISCHMAN In other 
Southern California Regional semifinal games: Crenshaw 110, Fresno Edison 92 -- 
After scoring just two points in Tuesday's first-round win against Poway, 6-6 
center Danny Griffin got a career-high 35 points to lead Crenshaw to the 
Division I win against visiting Edison. Griffin, who has signed with 
Pittsburgh, had a previous high of 23. Edison was led by 6-6 forward Bevice 
Bowen, who had a game-high 42 points. Dominguez 78, Del Mar Torrey Pines 70 -- 
Dejon Bernard, a 6-1 forward, scored 27 points to lead Dominguez, the Southern 
Section 4-A champion, to the Division II win at Torrey Pines. Dominguez (25-4) 
built a 55-42 margin after three quarters and then held on for the win. Torrey 
Pines (32-2) was led by Courtie Miller (31 points). Morningside 53, Corona del 
Mar 46 -- The win in this Division III game made up for a 57-56 loss in the 
Southern Section 3-A semifinals two weeks ago. Corona del Mar (20-11) closed 
within four points with 31 seconds left, but Chris Vance grabbed Jon Madison's 
missed shot, scored, was fouled on the play and converted the free throw to 
give the visiting Monarchs (23-5) a seven-point lead. Morningside will play 
Trabuco Hills in the Division III final Saturday at the Sports Arena at 1 p.m. 
Trabuco Hills 86, Lemoore 79 -- Rick Swanwick, a 6-10 center, scored 22 points 
to lead Trabuco Hills (24-6) to the Division III win at El Toro High. Tommie 
Jones scored a game-high 28 points for Lemoore (21-6). Easton Washington 74, 
Whittier Christian 61 -- Carl Ray Harris of Washington, which is just outside 
Fresno, had a game-high 27 points to make him the all-time Centeral Section 
single season scoring leader, passing Clifton Pondexter, who played at San 
Joaquin Memorial and later at Cal St. Long Beach. In the Division IV game at 
Fresno City College, Whittier Christian (23-7) was led by Paul McKinley with 10 
points.

BOXING AT THE SPORTS ARENA;

<P>
PEREZ SURVIVES BLOODY BOUT TO KEEP WBC TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raul Perez, the best boxer you never heard of, survived a savage bout with 
Argentinian Lucio Lopez at the Sports Arena Thursday night to retain his World 
Boxing Council bantamweight championship on a unanimous decision. 
</P>
<P>
It was the bloodiest bout seen in Southern California in several years. 
</P>
<P>
Halfway through the 12-round fight, both boxers were all but covered, front and 
back, with blood, flowing from cuts high on their foreheads. Ghengis Khan might 
have stopped this one, but not referee Chuck Hassett or ringside physician Dr. 
Bernhard Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot 11-inch, 117 1/2-pound Perez, in the first defense of his 
championship, had things going his way after two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
But midway through the third, Lopez, 5-4 and 116 3/4, butted him in a clinch. 
Perez came out of the clinch with a deep cut in his hairline, on the right side 
of his forehead. Hassett deducted a point from Lopez for the butt, warned him 
several more times for butts but failed to warn him after numerous other butts. 
</P>
<P>
In the third, Perez's wound bled freely, and while he seemed momentarily 
rattled, the 22-year-old champion from Tijuana managed to stay away from Lopez 
and land the heavier blows. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those in the crowd of about 5,000 were Perez supporters and loved it. 
They cheered and chanted, "Meh-hee-co!" and, when it was over, threw coins into 
the ring, where they landed in the blood. 
</P>
<P>
Perez's cut was ghastly enough. But Lopez, the 10th-ranked WBC 
super-bantamweight and South American champion, himself wound up with the same 
kind of cut in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
After that, spectators in the ringside seats were spattered the rest of the 
way. By the end, referee Hassett's sleeves were red to the elbow, and the front 
of Lopez's white shorts were pink. However, Hassett called only two timeouts 
between rounds -- after the third and eighth rounds. Schwartz visited Perez's 
corner only twice and never inspected Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
The only knockdown occurred in the 12th round, when Perez landed four 
consecutive blows to the head, the final one a short left hook. Lopez briefly 
dropped to one knee, then took a standing-eight count. 
</P>
<P>
Judges Terry Smith, Horico Castillo and Raul Caiz scored it for Perez by scores 
of 116-110, 115-112 and 116-111, respectively.

CAL POLY POMONA WOMEN SEEK ANOTHER TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Cal Poly Pomona has slightly higher expectations than most teams heading 
into the start of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s Division II women's 
basketball playoffs, there is plenty of justification. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos certainly have a good track record. 
</P>
<P>
In the eight years that the NCAA has held competition in women's basketball, 
Pomona has won three championships and made five trips to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the Division II West Regional, the dominance of the Broncos 
has been even more impressive. Pomona has won seven of the eight years, losing 
only to Chapman in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, ranked No. 3 in Division II with a 24-5 record, are favored again 
this year. They open play in the West Regional tonight against Cal State 
Hayward (13-14) at Cal Poly Pomona's Kellogg Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona Coach Darlene May said: "I think it's realistic for us to get 
to the Final Four. (But) we just can't look past anybody along the way." 
</P>
<P>
May, who has the most coaching wins in Division II history with a 393-90 record 
in 15 seasons, says she is not about to look past tonight's first-round game 
against Hayward. 
</P>
<P>
"To me it's a concern to play anybody," May said. "It doesn't matter what their 
record is. It's a one-game season now." 
</P>
<P>
Hayward earned an automatic berth in the Division II tournament by winning the 
Northern California Athletic Conference Tournament last week, defeating 
Humboldt State and Cal State Chico along the way. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers, who defeated Chico in the tournament final, 61-44, will be making 
their first appearance in the NCAA tournament. Hayward, under first-year Coach 
Dennis Frese, is led by 5-foot-6 guard Alicia James and 6-2 center Lori 
Zaragoza. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos won their fourth consecutive California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
Tournament title last Saturday by defeating Cal State Northridge, 75-62. Center 
Niki Bracken was named most valuable player for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Bracken, a 6-2 junior, had been slowed in recent games by an ankle sprain but 
scored 47 points and grabbed 18 rebounds in the conference tournament. She had 
30 points against Northridge and is averaging a team-leading 18.9 points and 
8.8 rebounds for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona also has All-American point guard Cathy Gooden, 5-5, who averages 15.6 
points and 5.4 assists, and 5-9 forward Sue Luckinbill, who averages 9.6 points 
and 5.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The only other top-20 team in the West Regional is 14th-ranked Northridge 
(21-8), which faces Florida Atlantic (21-7) in the opening game of the regional 
at 6 p.m., before Pomona plays Hayward at 8. The winners will meet for the 
championship at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
It will mark the first NCAA appearance for Florida Atlantic, which has suffered 
five of its seven losses to Division I teams. The Owls are led by forwards 
Valene Harris and Vicki Bentkowski. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, making its second appearance in the NCAA tournament, has been paced 
by all-conference players Chris Cavalin at forward and Bridgette Ealy at guard. 
Cavalin averages 15.1 points and 9.6 rebounds and Ealy 12.7 points and 6 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Just when it appeared that things couldn't get much worse for the Cal State Los 
Angeles men's basketball team, they did last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Eagles thought they had seen their last loss of the season with a 
97-58 setback to Cal Poly Pomona on Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
But the team learned last week that it would have to forfeit its only win of 
the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. season, a 79-67 decision over Pomona 
on Feb. 4, because it had used an ineligible player, 6-6 junior forward Omar 
Bray. "It's a situation that we regret because of the hard work Omar and the 
team have put in this season," said Carol Dunn, interim athletic director. "But 
we have standards to maintain and we must enforce them, no matter how painful 
they may be." 
</P>
<P>
The forfeit loss dropped the Golden Eagles to 0-14 in conference play -- the 
second consecutive season that they have not won a conference game -- and 2-25 
overall. Over the last two seasons the team has a forgettable record of 0-28 in 
the CCAA and 4-48 overall. 
</P>
<P>
The Biola men's basketball team was in a familiar position when it beat 
Southern California College for the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics 
District III title Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles (29-7) won their sixth district title in the 1980s, at the same time 
avenging two regular-season losses to Southern California College, which 
finished at 28-4. 
</P>
<P>
Biola will go on to the 32-team NAIA national tournament starting next Tuesday 
at the Kemper Arena in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
When the Cal State Northridge women's basketball team won its first game in the 
CCAA tournament last week, it established a new school record for wins in a 
season with 21. . . . With its subsequent victory over that same Northridge 
team, the Cal Poly Pomona women's basketball team improved its all-time record 
in the CCAA tournament to 8-0. The Broncos also have won the regular-season 
title eight straight years. 
</P>
<P>
UC Riverside is the only men's basketball team that has competed all four years 
in the CCAA tournament. The Highlanders won the title for the second time with 
an 87-83 victory over Chapman last Saturday. The win earned the Highlanders a 
berth in the NCAA Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Senior pitcher Rick Davis of Cal State Dominguez Hills suffered his first 
defeat of the season in a 4-1 setback to Chapman last Saturday but still has 
been among the most impressive players in the Southland among College Division 
teams. A shortstop last season, Davis has a 4-1 record and a 2.01 earned-run 
average with 76 strikeouts in 53 2/3 innings pitched and has held opponents to 
a .154 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
The Pomona-Pitzer men's basketball team lost to Cal State Stanislaus in the 
NCAA Division III West Regional semifinals, 90-78, then defeated Wartburg of

Phil Mahre, currently sandwiched between two Swedes near the top of the U.S. 
Pro Tour standings, will attempt to ski into the lead this weekend during the 
WinterFest races at Snow Summit. 
</P>
<P>
The former World Cup and Olympic champion has 415 points so far in his comeback 
at the age of 31, placing him second to Jorgen Sundqvist, who has 465. Mahre, 
with $41,650, has earned $650 more than Sundqvist, but both have made less than 
Niklas Lindqvist, third in the standings with 375 points but first in line at 
the ATM window with $47,730. 
</P>
<P>
Action at the Big Bear Lake resort gets under way today with qualifying for 
Sunday's slalom. The giant slalom is set for Saturday. Racing starts at 11 a.m. 
each day on Widowmaker Run, and there will also be a pro-celebrity event at 2 
p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
After 12 stops on the 16-meet pro circuit, Mahre has six slalom victories to 
his credit in the dual, head-to-head elimination format. Each first place is 
worth 35 points on a scale that drops to five points just for reaching the 
round of 32. 
</P>
<P>
Phil's twin brother, Steve, who hadn't won a race since the opening slalom in 
November at Park City, Utah, is out for the rest of the season. He injured a 
knee last weekend at Winter Park, Colo., and underwent surgery Wednesday at Dr. 
Richard Steadman's clinic in South Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
Spring conditions prevail at ski areas throughout California, where depths 
range from two to six feet in the sunny Southland, and up to 10 feet in the 
Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
Mammoth Mountain reported eight inches of new powder and a 6 1/2-foot base 
Thursday, but relatively warm temperatures in midweek meant rain and wet snow 
farther north, around Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
Skiing seems assured about everywhere at least through Easter. 
</P>
<P>
Other activities in the next few days include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- U.S. Ski Assn.'s Freestyle Mogul Finals Saturday and Sunday on Showtime Run 
at Bear Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 -- North Lake Tahoe-Truckee Winter Carnival through Sunday at Northstar and 
Squaw Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Corporate Ski Challenge, with 124 teams, Monday through March 18 at Alpine 
Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Top Gun on Gunbarrel mogul competition, for $10,000 in prizes, next 
Wednesday and Thursday at Heavenly Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 -- National Masters' Championships, for skiers 30 and over, Sunday through 
next Friday at Mt. Bachelor, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
And, oh yes, full-time residents of snow country will compete in their favorite 
ski-season pastimes during the Tahoe Local Man Winter Triathlon today at 
Homewood, near Tahoe City. The three sports: Installing tire chains, splitting 
firewood and shoveling snow. 
</P>
<P>
Skiing Notes 
</P>
<P>
World Cup racing, which began last November in Europe, is screeching to a halt 
this week at Shiga Kogen, Japan, where the schedule calls for a men's slalom 
today, a women's slalom Saturday and parallel races for both men and women 
Sunday. Alberto Tomba of Italy still has a chance to make up for a 
disappointing season by pulling out the slalom title today. He is third in the 
standings with 100 points, behind three-time overall champion Marc Girardelli 
of Luxembourg, who has 106, and Armin Bittner of West Germany, who has 102. 
Vreni Schneider of Switzerland, who has already won the women's overall cup, 
will be trying for a record-breaking 14th victory in one season Saturday. . . . 
The Alps, mostly bare throughout early winter, are becoming more skiable. Some 
sample snow depths passed along by Powder Ski Adventures in Mission Viejo this 
week include: Austria -- St. Anton 12 to 100 inches, Kitzbuhel 4-46; France -- 
Avoriaz 53-63, Chamonix 19-85, La Plagne 53-87, Val d'Isere 39-63, Val Thorens 
53-79; Italy -- Cortina d'Ampezzo 28-67, Val Gardena 16-55; Switzerland -- 
Davos 18-69, Saas Fe 12-59, Verbier 12-94. . . . Tennis star Chris Evert and 
her husband, former U.S. downhiller Andy Mill, will be Bob Beattie's guests on 
"Ski World" Sunday at 2:30 p.m. on ESPN. . . . Friedl Pfeifer, 77, who 
"discovered" Aspen, Colo., and first developed it for skiing in the mid-1940s, 
was the honored guest at Ski magazine's annual Legends of Skiing banquet last 
Saturday night at Beaver Creek, Colo.

One of the treats within "New York Stories," the new three-part movie about Big 
Apple life by Martin Scorsese, Francis Coppola and Woody Allen, is the Chanel 
fashion parade -- scaled down to kid size -- in Coppola's segment, "Life 
Without Zoe." It turns out that 17-year-old Sofia Coppola, who co-scripted with 
her famous father, worked summers at the Chanel atelier in Paris, according to 
a Chanel spokeswoman in New York. The film, about a poor little rich girl who 
is loco for Coco, is awash in berets, bijoux, bags -- even an enormous perfume 
bottle -- from the East 57th Street boutique, the source tells us, but the 
clothing is all from Paris. "Of course, there is no children's wear within the 
Chanel collection," she adds, speculating that Big Apple teens of means 
probably do mix "real Chanel -- in small sizes -- with other things." (The 
12-year-old protagonist combines a houndstooth hat and jacket with torn jeans.) 
And if it's not enough for Chanel worshipers to spot signature buttons and 
bows, there is a cameo by Chanel No. 5 spokeswoman Carole Bouquet, who plays a 
princess.

Not-So-Secret Service 
</P>
<P>
Since returning to California, Nancy Reagan has had more time to have her skin 
pampered at the Aida Grey Institut de Beaute in Beverly Hills. But nothing's 
changed about the tight security measures that still accompany the former First 
Lady on her every visit. According to Grey, Reagan's been in twice since her 
husband left office, and both times, Secret Service agents arrived to check out 
the salon before her arrival. And three agents remained with Reagan at the 
salon during her treatments, she says, noting that the same procedures were 
followed when Reagan visited during the preceding eight years. While Grey 
clearly enjoys seeing more of her famous client, she's making no secret of the 
fact that she'd also love to have Barbara Bush stop in so she could create a 
"natural, translucent look" for the current First Lady to accent her "quiet 
elegance." 
</P>
<P>
Sixties Socks 
</P>
<P>
E. G. Smith's Eric Smith was one of the first to get his foot in the door of 
the '60s revival in fashion. It was three years ago that the sock designer came 
out with his tie-dyed foot gear. Now he's added two more oh-so-'60s looks to 
his line -- one pair of socks printed with "Love" and another with those famous 
smile faces (which are also the trademark of the current Acid House music craze 
in London). Smith has been spreading his message by sending out heart-shaped 
greeting cards with socks that have "Love More, love Eric" written on the 
soles. The smile-face version reads "Have a Nice Sock." Smith's neo-hippie 
hosiery retails for about $8.50 at Bullock's.

Tina Cassaday, owner of the Beverly Hills' hair salon of the same name, seems 
to travel with a walking advertisement. She was celebrating her birthday at 
Disneyland recently with her 7-year-old-son, Justin, she tells Listen, when the 
pair was spotted by one of her clients, Miko Brando, son of Marlon. According 
to Cassaday, Brando liked Justin's layered hair style so much, he made his next 
appointment on the spot. As they sing at Disneyland: "It's a small world, after 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Wonder Wardrobe 
</P>
<P>
We had to do a double-take when we spotted a sophisticated-looking 13-year-old 
in a body-hugging, polka-dot Guess? suit and huge hoop earrings recently in the 
foyer of the Leo S. Bing Theater at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The 
willowy brunette, whose long hair was pulled up in a high, knotted ponytail, 
was whispering to a slightly older blond boy dressed in black with lizard-skin 
boots. The two were Danica McKellar and Jason Hervey, known to "Wonder Years" 
viewers as the winsome Winnie Cooper and junior-high tough guy Wayne Arnold. On 
the hit ABC show, set in '68-'69, the youngsters frequently wear bell bottoms 
and tie dyes -- truly vintage looks for actors born in the mid-'70s. McKellar 
and Hervey were at a Museum of Broadcasting presentation on their Emmy-winning 
sitcom, after which a show staffer confided that "the kids ask if people really 
wore those things in the '60s. But some of the adult actors could just walk 
right in in their own clothes."

Son's Red Letter Day 
</P>
<P>
Another Hayman has entered the fashion fray. Robert, 30-year-old son of Rodeo 
Drive retailer, parfumeur and Giorgio co-creator Fred Hayman, has become a 
clothing manufacturer. In December, he introduced Red Square Wear, a unisex 
clothing concept incorporating Soviet-inspired prints, such as a "double nyet" 
pattern, a "little red man" motif and a sexy-woman design entitled "babushka." 
Vanna White has worn the shirt that says "I love you" in Russian. "We're not a 
political company, and we're not a peace movement," explains Hayman, who says 
he merely has a fascination for Soviet imagery. Dad was initially skeptical, 
the younger Hayman admits. However, he must be impressed now. In addition to 
being carried at stores like Theodore, Fred Segal, Ron Ross and Nordstrom, the 
line is available at Fred Hayman Beverly Hills.

THE MAGICAL TREASURE OF 'BARON MUNCHAUSEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We wouldn't really want to be children again. Mumps. Chicken pox. First day of 
school. Big dogs. But to find the world an adventure, an astonishment. 
Believable again. Who wouldn't want that? 
</P>
<P>
That is Terry Gilliam's gift: He spins his yarn about an elegant old duffer who 
has waltzed round and round through the air with the goddess Venus, who has 
been to the moon and has the moon dust in his shoes to prove it and we are his, 
our eyes as round as the fullest moon. 
</P>
<P>
Children won't know that "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen" (selected 
theaters) is the most sophisticated vision imaginable. That a treasure-chest of 
references -- from movies, old and new, animated and otherwise; from the 
history of art and from music and mythology -- is being spilled out for them. 
That their imaginations as well as their funny bones are being tickled and 
that, actually, they are being taught to prefer the beautiful to the gaudy, the 
perfect to the shoddy. (You hate to think what the Care Bears will look like 
after "Munchausen.") Children will simply accept the movie's magic 
matter-of-factly, the way they do a book by Maurice Sendak or a movie as 
effortlessly fine as "The Black Stallion." They don't yet know how great a 
present it is, and that's probably best. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of us have no such stake in keeping our cool, and from its very first 
minutes, "Munchausen's" witty splendor is reason enough to lose ours. In an 
unnamed European city under siege from the Turks in the late 18th Century, a 
very tatty theater company is attempting to tell the miraculous adventures of a 
semi-fraud, Karl Friedrich Hieronymus, the Baron von Munchausen. 
</P>
<P>
The Theater Royal itself, backstage and onstage, is enough to hook us: There is 
an enormous sea monster with sea-blue-green scales who might have swum straight 
out of Sendak and seductive mermaids (the most seductive Uma Thurman from 
"Dangerous Liaisons" and Valentina Cortese, in the first of their double 
roles). Suddenly, just as we are entering a Turkish harem, the performance is 
interrupted by a tottering old gentleman (John Neville) who says he is the 
baron himself. 
</P>
<P>
To prove it, he will save the city from the siege and set a few facts about 
himself straight. But to do this, he needs his four friends: Berthold (Eric 
Idle), the fastest man alive; Albrecht (Winston Dennis) the strongest; Adolphus 
(Charles McKeown) the most farsighted and Gustavus (Jack Purvis) the most 
leather-lunged. 
</P>
<P>
Only the spirited Sally Salt, 10-year-old daughter of the troupe's impresario, 
believes him, but she's enough for Gilliam: The adventures are off and rolling. 
Salt is played by Sarah Polley, a marvelously feisty, blessedly un-cute 
Canadian actress who seems to have been raised oblivious to any child-acting 
cliches. A perfect foil for the richly classic shadings of Neville's Baron, 
Polley is irresistible. (Kids will recognize her at once as Ramona Quimby, from 
the splendid PBS series based on Beverly Cleary's "Ramona" books.) 
</P>
<P>
And so we glide back into the harem again, which this time is "real," staffed 
by Fellini-esque harem ladies so pinkly voluminous they appear to be made out 
of folds of salt-water taffy. It's the domain of a cheerfully lethal Sultan 
(Peter Jeffrey), and the consequences of a bet he makes with Munchausen are the 
bombardment of the city. 
</P>
<P>
That is how things began, Munchausen explains to a skeptical audience. If he 
can leave the besieged city and seek out his four invaluable friends, he will 
raise the siege. And so, in a hot-air balloon made from the silken knickers of 
the town's ladies, and with Sally, who has secretly stowed away on board, 
Munchausen soars off, to hover between faith and disbelief, reality and 
illusion, old age and virile manhood. 
</P>
<P>
"He won't get far on hot air and fantasy," sneers his nemesis, the Right 
Ordinary Horatio Jackson (Jonathan Pryce, terrifying behind his Three Blind 
Mice glasses), chief bureaucrat of the city. Ah, but how wrong he is. Those are 
exactly the qualities the world needs a shot of -- and that movies soar upon. 
</P>
<P>
(That, and money, and how ever much this extravaganza cost, it is, as they say, 
all up there on the screen a thousandfold. Frankly, it is beside the point of 
this film, anyway, not its big news.) 
</P>
<P>
The baron is a terribly reassuring hero. Not all of us have adjusted to the Age 
of Reason, no matter how long it's been upon us. For those discombobulated by 
astronauts and space stations, who can barely manage daylight savings time and 
who are put off by an invention with more moving parts than a fly swatter, the 
baron is our man. 
</P>
<P>
And Gilliam is our man too. Ironically, he has harnessed the most advanced side 
of movie technology to make poetry, not hard-edged hardware. To give us a 
shimmering, tide-rippled moonscape, littered with giant heads like some silent 
De Chirico vista; to offer a theater that Piranesi might have etched, an angel 
of darkness that Goya would recognize. 
</P>
<P>
But its best moments go straight into our filmic unconscious, as unerringly as 
"The Thief of Baghdad" or "Pinocchio" or "Moliere," to create new pockets of 
wonder. There are the King and Queen of the Moon, whose heads and bodies can be 
-- and frequently are -- separated: reason and carnality, nicely 
differentiated. If the king, "Ray D. Tutto" / Rei di Tutto / King of 
Everything, sounds madly familiar, it is an unbilled Robin Williams, creating 
his own amazing universe. 
</P>
<P>
There is the baron's dalliance with no less than Venus herself (Uma Thurman, 
naturally), who has stepped daintily out of her Botticelli clam shell. The 
sight of them, waltzing upward into the sky, attended by angels whose wings 
flutter like hummingbirds, is enough to make steam shoot from the ears of her 
hairy husband, Vulcan (Oliver Reed, also naturally). 
</P>
<P>
And more and more and more. But it is "Munchausen's" theme, that in the face of 
logic and reason, there is still a place for the imagination, that is its 
greatest gift. "We cannot fly to the moon. We must face facts. We must live in 
the modern world," gloats archvillain Pryce. 
</P>
<P>
For all those whom the modern world unsettles slightly, there is Munchausen. 
And small, sturdy Sally. And, thank the Lord, Terry Gilliam, captaining his 
magnificent artisans: production designer Dante Ferretti, cinematographer 
Giuseppe Rotunno, costume designer Gabriella Pescucci, special effects man 
Richard Conway, editor Peter Hollywood and composer Michael Kamen. And whoever 
it was who persuaded Munchausen's horse to sit.

'TO THE LIMIT' TESTED LIMITS OF FILM GROUP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In December, 1987, Dr. Roger Nichols, the president of the fledgling Museum 
Film Network, died of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
"That became the moment of truth" for "To the Limit," the network's first 
attempt at developing an IMAX-OMNIMAX film, said Dr. Jeffrey W. Kirsch, 
executive director of the Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater, a founding member of 
the Museum Film Network. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the original six members of the 2-year-old film network, consisting of 
museum and science centers from around the world, was risking hundreds of 
thousands of dollars on "To the Limit," which makes its world debut March 11 at 
the Fleet Space Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols, the director of the Museum of Science in Boston, had been instrumental 
in bringing the group together -- and keeping it together. They were trying to 
do something that had never been done before -- to work as one unit to produce 
an extremely expensive, science-oriented film in the big-screen IMAX-OMNIMAX 
format. 
</P>
<P>
"His leadership ability was something quite astonishing to watch," Kirsch said. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols sudden death left a pall on the project. The film is dedicated to him. 
</P>
<P>
"It (Nichols death) was a stunning event for me," said Kirsch, who replaced 
Nichols as president of the network. "I said I would do it because I wasn't 
going to let Roger down. It energized me and made it clear the network was 
going to carry through on Roger's promise" to produce the film. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols death was the most serious of many "moments of truth" in the 
development of the $3-million "To the Limit," a look at the potential of the 
human body, complete with inner body photography shot with a microscopic camera 
developed especially for the project. 
</P>
<P>
The Museum Film Network was brought together to specifically address the need 
for science-oriented IMAX and OMNIMAX films. "To the Limit" will be marketed 
complete with a package of educational materials on the human body. 
</P>
<P>
"The (IMAX and OMNIMAX) films being produced were travelogues or films that 
exploited the medium with sensational scenes, lots of visual impact," said Dr. 
Paul Knappenberger, director of the Science Museum of Virginia in Richmond. 
"But there was very little in terms of scientific messages." 
</P>
<P>
Bringing together the museums and science centers was not an easy task. Some 
centers experienced in producing films, such as the Science Museum of Minnesota 
based in St. Paul, refused to participate. 
</P>
<P>
The first incarnation of the network consisted of five members -- Boston, 
Chicago, San Diego, Richmond and Detroit -- then the National Museum of Natural 
Science of Taiwan came on board, giving the project an international flavor. 
Each was looking out for its own interests. 
</P>
<P>
"This institution had (made films) before," Kirsch said. "But for others it was 
something new." 
</P>
<P>
Deciding on a topic was the first major source of debate. A group was hired to 
research OMNIMAX audiences in different cities. The film had to be educational, 
but also entertaining enough to attract an audience. Antarctica and a look at 
the formation of weather were considered but eventually discarded, although 
Antarctica might be used in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to use the medium to the fullest," MacGillivray said. "We don't want 
to present something that can be presented equally as well on TV." 
</P>
<P>
Nichols brought in the public broadcasting group WGBH-NOVA to serve as 
co-executive producer's of the first film. NOVA's involvement gave the project 
basic respectability in the science industry, in addition to a voice 
experienced in the techniques and nuances of making entertaining and 
educational science films. NOVA's background was especially important in 
developing the inner body sequences. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first venture into a non-television project for NOVA, the science 
program specialists based with WGBH, the public broadcasting entity in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed to be an exciting visual challenge," NOVA Executive Producer Paula 
Apsell said. "We had never worked in anything outside an 18-inch television 
screen. When they were talking about a screen as big as a house we saw it was 
an interesting opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
WGBH-NOVA paid $50,000 to become an associate of the film network. In exchange, 
it will receive a small share of the profits from the film. 
</P>
<P>
"IMAX films are really a good way to help people understand what science and 
technology is all about," Apsell said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though NOVA's involvement gave the project instant credibility in the 
science community, it also carried a certain mental burden for some members of 
the network. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a two-edged sword," Kirsch said. "We knew with NOVA's involvement it 
would be a quality film, but some were afraid it would be too much like a PBS 
film." 
</P>
<P>
In the fall of 1987, the five original members finally signed their names to 
contracts, agreeing to pay $225,000 each into the film project, with another 
$300,000 in escrow. Detroit was unable to raise the $300,000 and dropped out in 
October, eventually replaced by Omniversum from The Hague, Holland. 
</P>
<P>
"Until that moment everybody was still hedging," Kirsch said. 
</P>
<P>
Once the individual museums had approved the script, there were no more 
committee reviews. Extremely conscious of the old saying about "too many cooks 
. . . ," the members of the network had to agree not to get involved in the 
day-to-day production activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Another moment of truth," Kirsch said. 
</P>
<P>
A debate enused over the production structure. Kirsch wanted a member of the 
network to oversee production; Nichols thought it would be best to have someone 
in charge who had experience with developing science films, mainly NOVA. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually a compromise was reached. Kirsch and Apsell would serve as 
co-executive producers with Kirsch serving as the lone link between the network 
and the producers. 
</P>
<P>
"Kirsch was responsible for communicating with me," said MacGillivray, whose 
company produced such OMNIMAX favorites as "To Fly" and "Speed." "He was the 
filtering system." 
</P>
<P>
Another "moment of truth" arose when MacGillivray decided he had to go to 
Russia. He wanted to focus on a ballet dancer, and after a year of research he 
decided he had to have a ballet dancer from the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Dancers from throughout the world had been considered, including Mikhail 
Baryshnikov, but MacGillivray steadfastly insisted on a female ballet dancer, 
and that meant Russia. He also pointed out the marketing advantages of using 
Russian footage. 
</P>
<P>
"Going to Russia became a necessity," MacGillivray said. 
</P>
<P>
Already, one member had dropped out of the network, the Detroit science center, 
pleading lack of funds. MacGillivray's request to go to Russia, in addition to 
adding mountains of red tape, was going to push the project far over the 
strained budget established by the already jittery network. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg's dedication to going to Russia pulled it off," Kirsch said. That and 
MacGillivray's agreement to loan the project some of his company's money. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so intent on it," Kirsch said. "And I think he was right. The dancer he 
recorded (Nina Ananiashvili) is unbelievable."

2 GUYS OF 'GREATER TUNA' EXPOSE FOIBLES OF SMALL AND BIGGER TOWNS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever wonder what happened to Richard Nixon's Silent Majority -- the ones who 
wanted to help make a better America for the "right" kind of people? 
</P>
<P>
They're alive and well and living in "Greater Tuna," a sendup of the 
third-smallest city in Texas by co-writers and actors Joe Sears and Jaston 
Williams at the Lyceum Stage through April 2. 
</P>
<P>
The cheerfully self-satisfied residents of Tuna include station OKKK 
newscasters Thurston Wheelis and Arles Struvie, who couldn't be prouder of the 
titles of this year's winning high school essays: "Human Rights, Why Bother?" 
and "The Other Side of Bigotry." 
</P>
<P>
And then there's Vera Carp, vice president of Smut Snatchers, an organization 
determined to pull such words as "deflowered" and "nuts" from the dictionary. 
Remarkably, these three and 17 others -- including an unadoptable perennial 
canine of the week named Yippy -- are all played by Sears and Williams. 
</P>
<P>
That the two know their terrain is a given. Both were out-of-work actors in 
Austin, Tex., when they put this show together seven years ago. Later, Ed 
Howard came on board as a director and co-writer and "Greater Tuna" has been 
supporting them ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the "Greater Tuna" success story is obviously the skills of Sears and 
Williams. Sears uses his beefy frame to take on the slow, solid citizens: the 
depressed matrons, the cliche-ridden reverend, the menacing sheriff, the 
insensitive husband, and he reveals surprising emotional depths in most of 
them. The slightly built Williams buzzes around Sears with a series of children 
and snappy, waspish and hapless adults, providing more of the stinging side of 
the comedy. 
</P>
<P>
But part of the success, too, is due to localizing small towns as figures of 
small-minded fun. The laughter then takes on a spirit of exorcism as clever 
urban audiences identify the problem as being outside them. 
</P>
<P>
But, before you laugh too much, there is that apt phrase that Vera Carp 
(Williams), the queen of smut snatchers said to Pearl Burras (Sears), dog 
poisoner extraordinaire when Pearl criticizes Vera's boy: "Glass houses . . . " 
The sad part is that you don't have to live in a small town in Texas to 
champion censorship. You could be a well-to-do matron from a suburb of Detroit 
like Terry Rakolta, whose protests of "Married . . . With Children" pulled 
advertising support from the show. Or you could be the leader of Iran. 
</P>
<P>
And when San Diego is a home to Tom Metzger and the Skinheads, how much of a 
finger can you point at Elmer Watkins (Sears) addressing the Tuna chapter of 
the KKK? 
</P>
<P>
But the single most remarkable thing Sears and Williams make you do is care 
even for the very people they are using for target practice. They can actually 
take would-be book burner, Bertha Bumiller (Sears), and make you squirm when 
the smart young interviewer (Williams) makes critical mincemeat of her beliefs 
without her even suspecting. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Bertha tells the interviewer, she wants to ban "Romeo and Juliet" because 
it shows a rampant disregard for parental authority and, besides, it encourages 
teen-age sex. 
</P>
<P>
But doesn't she know that "Romeo and Juliet" is by William Shakespeare? the 
young man asks, rolling his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," she says. "And we're looking into his other works. . . . Didn't he write 
'Barefoot in the Park?' " 
</P>
<P>
But the joke turns sad when the young man leaves leaves smiling, because he has 
such a good story, and Bertha sighs with relief. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad he didn't ask about my family," Bertha says. 
</P>
<P>
She's glad he didn't ask her about her son in reform school, her husband who 
runs around on her, or her daughter who believes her life is over because she 
never made cheerleader. 
</P>
<P>
And, by the time Sears finishes Bertha's slow, measured, painful account of all 
the things that have gone wrong for the woman in ways that she doesn't even 
understand, one is close to tears for the very same person who seemed such a 
deserving target of ridicule just a few moments before. 
</P>
<P>
Moments like those save the script from being a one-joke show about Tuna to 
being a portrait of a people who are not so few and far between as many might 
like to believe.

The crisis facing the Massachusetts Council on the Arts and Humanities has been 
tempered slightly by a compromise in the state Legislature that will give the 
group half of its expected $19.5 million budget. The council was facing 
extinction, hit not only with a budget deficit but also word that the 
Legislature might kill its budget entirely. But the legislators voted a 
comprise $9.5 million for the council and the final budget will be worked out 
between the state's House and Senate. Angered supporters regard the cut as a 
tragedy, the New York Times reported. The council disperses grant money to 
cultural institutions and artists. ALEENE MacMINN

An extremely rare drawing of Mickey Mouse by Walt Disney has been bought for 
$110,000 by a private Canadian collector, making it the third most expensive 
animation artwork ever sold, according to Christie's East auction gallery. Only 
six drawings of Mickey by his creator are known to exist, and all the others 
are postage-stamp size. The sketch sold to the anonymous collector is 13 3/4 
inches by 14 1/2 inches. Disney drew the work in 1935 on the guest book of an 
unidentified film director and his wife and signed his signature. Joshua Arfer, 
Christie's animation art specialist, said that "a genuine Walt Disney signature 
is pure gold for an animation collector, but his Mickey is platinum." 
Christie's handled the private sale between the director's widow and the 
collector, who is said to own more than 100 pieces of original animation art 
work material valued at more than $1 million. The price was eight times that 
paid recently for a Walt Disney Studio artist's pencil drawing sketch from "The 
Mail Pilot," a 1933 film. In November, two rare black and white cells from Walt 
Disney's 1934 "The Orphan's Benefit," captured record prices of $148,500 and 
$121,000. ALEENE MacMINN

Johnny Carson fans can sleep better now. The longtime host of NBC's "Tonight 
Show" told his TV audience Wednesday night that he'll be back for at least one 
more season after this one. As Carson related it, the agreement came about 
during lunch with Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment. "We talked 
as we do about this time every year. He said 'What are your plans?' I said, 
'Maybe we should do another year.' So we signed it and we're going to continue 
for another year from September." Carson added that last year, he made "a 
foolish mistake -- I said I'll do another year when it snows in Malibu . . . 
and it snowed in Malibu, so here we are." In years past, Carson often has been 
the subject of much will-he-or-will-he-not-stay speculation, an exercise 
squelched for the time being by his announcement. ALEENE MacMINN

KCBS-TV's Valerie Coleman, who has been commuting for six months from her home 
in San Francisco to Channel 2 where she anchors the noon news broadcast, has 
decided to stay permanently in the Bay Area. Her duties on Channel 2's midday 
news will be taken over starting Thursday by Tricia Toyota, who will also 
continue on the station's 6 p.m. news. Up north, Coleman will rejoin KCBS 
Newsradio as a morning co-anchor, a position she worked from 1984-86. However, 
she'll still retain some ties here. She's going to provide Channel 2 with a 
three-times-a-week opinion segment about the family, covering "light, easy 
subjects and serious issues." The segments will be taped at her home. ALEENE

'TUNE THE GRAND UP' COULD USE FINE-TUNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another Jerry Herman revue? 
</P>
<P>
"Tune the Grand Up," at the Back Alley Theatre, is the third salute to the 
popular Broadway lightweight (composer/lyricist of "Hello, Dolly!," "Mame," "La 
Cage aux Folles") to be seen here recently. Long Beach's Studio Theatre 
presented the most famous Herman revue, "Jerry's Girls," and a second Herman 
program made up a recent AIDS benefit. 
</P>
<P>
It all seems somewhat excessive. Herman's oeuvre is hardly inexhaustible; "Tune 
the Grand Up" repeats many of the songs heard in "Jerry's Girls." 
</P>
<P>
Nor is Herman the ideal composer to focus on for an entire evening, or two or 
three. His songs are not deep. They don't yield new insights from repeated 
performances. They don't need the shows that gave them birth to be understood, 
but they do need those shows, with their characters and dramatic situations, in 
order to soar. 
</P>
<P>
"Tune the Grand Up" has a few advantages over "Jerry's Girls." The title and 
concept aren't as condescending, and the inclusion of men on stage as well as 
women naturally leads to a wider range of dramatic possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Tune" features a half-dozen more songs than the 36 in "Jerry's Girls." Most 
are truncated -- which is no great loss for many of them, but which dilutes the 
effect of the best songs, such as "If He Walked Into My Life." This adds to the 
impression of superficiality that's inherent in the material. 
</P>
<P>
Director Rick Roemer has assembled a fascinating cast. Two of the five are 
conventionally young and slim-trim, but the other three add a welcome note of 
variety to the usual look of such shows. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the show is Sharon Murray. She looks uncomfortable when she 
first appears in the upbeat opening ensemble numbers. She's a large woman, in a 
strapless dress that isn't very flattering (Don Nelson did the costumes). But 
then we hear her voice, and it's a powerful, rich instrument. 
</P>
<P>
She also acts her solos for all they're worth. Her renditions of the fierce 
"Wherever He Ain't" and the doleful "Time Heals Everything," both from "Mack 
and Mabel," are the show's highlights. 
</P>
<P>
They're also among the most simply staged numbers. Roemer's and choreographer 
Carol Woodbury's inventive blocking helps disguise the shallowness of the 
material, and musical director Nelms McKelvain (at the grand, of course) keeps 
the show hopping (too much so in a strangely jittery "It Only Takes a Moment"). 
But the show could use a few more concentrated or unexpected moments, such as 
the slow and harmonically interesting approach to "Hello, Dolly!" at the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
And it could do without a silent movie parody, featuring the cast on film, that 
interrupts the performance of "Movies Were Movies" with a labored stab at 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbury performs as well as choreographs, adding her throaty voice and 
irrepressible vigor. Brad Blaisdell contributes a screwy comic look. The 
capable Mark McGee and Maureen Mershon have the more conventional voices and 
looks, but they indulge in some unnecessary mugging. 
</P>
<P>
The set consists of posters from Herman shows (including "Jerry's Girls") 
tacked on to the fence erected for "Voice of the Prairie," which shares the 
space, but Lawrence Oberman's lighting design is considerably more 
sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
 At 15231 Burbank Blvd., Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 8 p.m., Fridays at 10 p.m., 
Saturdays at 3 p.m. and 10 p.m., through May 20. Tickets: $14.50-$18.50; (818)

STAGE BEAT : 'COUNTRY OF YOUNG' AT CELTIC ARTS; 'LA RONDE' AT HARMAN AVENUE; 
'BODIES ONCE YOUNG' AT BEYOND BAROQUE; 'JOSEPH' IN LONG BEACH; 'GENERATIONS' BY 
COLONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A play dramatizing the relationship between poet William Butler Yeats and the 
fierce Irish nationalist Maud Gonne is a curiosity whose appeal might point to 
literati and keepers of the Gaelic flame. 
</P>
<P>
But in this West Coast premiere of "The Country of the Young" at the Celtic 
Arts Center, Yeats' unrequited love for tempestuous freedom-fighter Gonne in 
turn-of-the-century Ireland assumes a gnarling passion that is absorbing as 
theater and literary history. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Susie Burke shows us Yeats in his middle 20s, before his fame, when 
he is bedazzled by the beautiful, wealthy, agrarian protest leader Gonne, who 
enlists him in her cause to free Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
As Yeats, sublimating his love for Gonne into his art, Michael Bryan is 
endearing in his restrained ardor. Vikki Powell's heroine catches the force of 
a suffragist, a worldly, rebellious woman who sublimates her own human 
passions, including her children, to the cause of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Yeats once wrote in an unpublished memoir that Gonne became "the troubling time 
of my life," and director Brendan Dillon accelerates the churning rhythms of a 
relationship that both inspires and agonizes the virginal Yeats. 
</P>
<P>
Most interesting, in this two-character play, is the couple's 
literary/political axis, a kind of surrogate sex. But undying patience takes 
its toll on Yeats. The characters, through the decade or so that we follow 
them, tumble into deepening confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
The play's staging suffers ragged moments. A desk and settee fail to counter 
the dankness of the interior set design. But this earthly reduction of lofty 
figures never deflates or demeans the subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5651 Hollywood Blvd., Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 3 p.m., 
through March 26. Tickets: $6-$10; (213) 462-6844. 
</P>
<P>
'La Ronde' 
</P>
<P>
A carrousel of sexual entanglements in decadent Vienna, Austrian playwright 
Arthur Schnitzler's "La Ronde" slips in and out of focus in Martin Magner's 
production at the Harman Avenue Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The show enjoys sybaritic moments as it spins through 10 seductive dialogues. 
Actors Stephanie White, Tim Didlake, Rick Telles and Ron Brooks stylishly catch 
the promiscuity and the last hurrah of Hapsburg Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
But director Magner, a specialist in modern central European drama, has 
discarded the traditional Eric Bentley translation for a new and more idiomatic 
translation by Carl R. Mueller. The contemporary shift in tone alternately 
wings the play out of Imperial Vienna (turn-of-the century nightshirts 
notwithstanding). In one instance of miscasting, Jeffrey Winner's abrasively 
clownish poet blows the fin de siecle aura altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Schnitzler, a contemporary of Freud, wrote with the dispassion of the physician 
he was. And the majority of Magner's 10-member cast mirrors the cynical, 
furtive dance of loveless love (Stacey Havener's deceptive sweetness is a 
plum). But too many of these shifting duets end up as cardboard sex instead of 
Schnitzler's intricate betrayals. On the other hand, the lascivious actress and 
the count (White and Didlake) epitomize the cynical intangibles of an overripe 
Vienna. There are Strauss waltzes in the air, but no student prince. 
</P>
<P>
 At 521 La Brea Ave., Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 p.m., through 
April 2. Tickets: $8-$12; (213) 466-1767. 
</P>
<P>
'Bodies Once Young' 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Baroque's theater wing is committed to the use of language, and in the 
case of "Bodies Once Young," the company is dramatizing two short stories, 
Sherwood Anderson's "The Man Who Became a Woman" and "Fudge" by Meridel Le 
Sueur. 
</P>
<P>
Director Alec Doyle's evocation of these Midwestern monologues is seductive, 
pristine, almost bleached in the production's lean and clean verbal momentum. 
</P>
<P>
In "Fudge," first published in "Fantasy" magazine in 1933 and adapted by Martin 
Worman, performer Jay W. MacIntosh's rich country accent has to fight echoic 
stage acoustics, but she prevails. Her portrait of a woman looking out her 
window and recreating a woeful tale of lost opportunity is quietly riveting. 
</P>
<P>
The more bizarre solo turn is by Joseph G. Medalis playing a husband taking a 
bath in "The Man Who Became a Woman," from Anderson's short-story collection 
"Horses and Men" (1923) and adapted by William Lanteau and director Doyle. Easy 
preconceptions make the title misleading but it makes psychological sense. 
</P>
<P>
Medalis is sublime splashing water around in his old-fashioned bathtub with its 
four little feet. His character blithely shares his strange coming-of-age 
story, concerning an attraction for a racehorse when he was a youthful groom on 
the fairgrounds circuit. 
</P>
<P>
The evening is short but unique, with expressive acting turning the 
first-person narrative form into theatrical coinage. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Old Venice City Hall, 681 Venice Blvd., Venice, Saturdays and Sundays, 
8 p.m., through March 19. Tickets: $8; (213) 822-3006. 
</P>
<P>
'Joseph' 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Community Playhouse is staging the nostalgic "Joseph," a young 
man's reminiscence of his childhood growing up in his father's New York deli in 
the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
The new play by Long Beach playwright Arthur Josephs has 13 cast members, four 
of whom give credible performances: Ralph Richmond's boisterous Jewish father 
figure, Jesse Sweeney as his young son, Jim Grollman as the young boy grown up, 
and Dennis Mooney's staunch family friend. 
</P>
<P>
But stereotypical characters abound. Director Robert Telford's staging is flat 
and stiff. The show has no momentum or respect for detail. We're in the early 
1930s and hear the father describe Trotsky's murder, which didn't occur until 
1940. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5021 E. Anaheim St., Long Beach, tonight and Saturday only, 8 p.m. Tickets: 
$9; (213) 494-1616. 
</P>
<P>
'Generations' 
</P>
<P>
The Colony's generational drama at the Studio Theatre Playhouse features strong 
acting and a textured production design. But these rewards are lavished on a 
crisis that never generates tension. 
</P>
<P>
Set outside a family cabin in the Oregon mountains, "Generations" by Dennis 
Clontz is overwrought with relationships difficult to sort out and slow to 
gather momentum. 
</P>
<P>
The play's catalyst, who alights from her cabin in the second act, is a 
mentally ailing mother with brief intimations of awareness (distinctively 
played by Kathryn Fuller). 
</P>
<P>
Frustrations fester among the old lady's caring husband (the quiet dignity of 
Russ Marin) and the aging couple's three visiting adult children (an affable 
Richard Lineback, a jittery-when-not-hysterical Judith Heinz and the simmering, 
visceral J. Downing, who also designed the dimensional, woodsy set). Meanwhile, 
a gathering storm brews within a reticent in-law (Kristina Coggins). 
</P>
<P>
Few of these eddies and swirls are involving or focused. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1944 Riverside Dr., tonight and Saturday, 8 p.m., ends Sunday, 7 p.m. 
Tickets: $10-$15; (213) 665-3011.

O'CONNORS HOLD FAMILY REUNION WITH 'AUNT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There's a new theater in Studio City -- or rather an old theater newly reborn. 
It used to be called the Showplace, one of two small legit houses with the 
uncommon distinction of being situated over a bowling alley (hate the play, 
play the lanes). 
</P>
<P>
There is some question as to whether this new 68-seat palace has been renamed 
the Donald O'Connor Family Theatre or the Donald O'Connor Family's Theatre 
(flyers in the hall had it both ways). But judging from the lineup of O'Connors 
listed in the program as on stage and backstage, the second appellation may be 
more accurate. 
</P>
<P>
The new theater opened Tuesday with that venerable old chestnut, Brandon 
Thomas' "Charley's Aunt." It features three O'Connors: Papa Donald (a hoot as 
that impudent matron of the title -- a role he played at Chicago's Drury Lane 
about 17 years ago), son D. Frederick and daughter Alicia. Papa also directed. 
The house was packed. It was a party. 
</P>
<P>
The production sets no new standards, breaks no records and wins no awards, but 
it has a sweetness and lack of pretension that almost make up for the play's 
creakiness, the wing-and-a-prayer sets, the in-and-out accents and the uneven 
acting. It is indeed a family affair. 
</P>
<P>
There are some stage-worthy performances: suave Jack Hagarty and blustery 
Malcolm Rothman as the older gentlemen in lip-smacking pursuit of their 
unlikely target (the aunt), and Richard Merson as the ubiquitous butler 
Brassett. Alicia O'Connor makes a winsome Ela Delahay and Carmen Recker smartly 
plays Amy Spettigue as a bubbly air-head. But the balance of the company needs 
to get its act together, though it forged ahead gamely Tuesday and seemed to 
have a good time. 
</P>
<P>
No one more so than O'Connor pere, whose jaunty wit, super timing and innate 
comic sense light up the stage and pick the show up whenever it stumbles 
(often). Part of his directing in this production seems to include rescuing it 
at regular intervals with funny personal business and comic ad-libs when lines 
fail or cues aren't picked up. Those moments at Tuesday's performance often 
proved more amusing than the scripted ones. 
</P>
<P>
Future plans for this theater are vague, but Donald O'Connor himself is not 
likely to be deeply involved. Other professional commitments call. What the 
family does with it (namely his offspring, two more of whom are on the board of 
directors along with a son-in-law) remains to be seen. It can continue to go 
for family fun and games or it can turn serious. But if it chooses to compete 
on the open market, it will have to develop a point of view and some real 
quality control. The opportunity is there. So is the competition.

THURBER'S 'MANY MOONS'

<TEXT>
<P>
Humorist James Thurber, known for his acerbic jabs at the battle between the 
sexes, also spun magical fairy tales for his own and his young daughter's 
amusement. One of these was "Many Moons," a romp of a story about a spoiled 
princess and her indulgent father. 
</P>
<P>
Adapted for the stage by Charlotte B. Chorpenning, it's playing at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center's Founders Hall, performed by South Coast 
Repertory's Young Conservatory Players. 
</P>
<P>
Princess Lenore (Kate Duffus) wants the moon, and until she gets it, she's 
going to pine away in bed, to the consternation of her father, the King (adult 
actor Clif Alvey), and the entire kingdom. The King's Wise Men are no help. 
Only the lowly Jester (Zen Gesner, a handsome teen who plays a mean trumpet) 
can show how to make the impossible possible. 
</P>
<P>
The Players' production, directed by John-David Keller, is good-natured, but 
uneven. Lost in the young cast's energetic delivery are the subtleties of 
Thurber's finely woven, verbal whimsy. At Saturday's second performance, the 
audience grew restless long before the play's wistful and wise ending. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, however, the Players, a group of 10- to 17-year-old theater arts 
trainees, are given a quality setting in which to shine. Dwight Richard Odle's 
set is pretty and simple -- just the princess' bed and the king's swiveling 
throne. The medieval costumes, on the other hand, are a visual feast for young 
eyes: lush, witty and multihued. 
</P>
<P>
 At 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. The final performances are tonight, 
7:30; Saturday-Sunday, 1 and 3:30 p.m. $6. (714) 957-4033.

Le Corbusier -- the pseudonymous Swiss-born architect famous for his severe, 
functional buildings -- generally came to his office in Paris only after 
spending the morning at home working on his paintings. In 1918, as a 
self-taught 31-year-old fresh from a small Alpine town, Charles-Edouard 
Jeanneret had encountered the painter and designer Amedee Ozenfant, who dazzled 
him with the geometric harmonies of Purism (a smoothed-out, more readable 
offshoot of Cubism). 
</P>
<P>
A few years later Ozenfant had suggested a suitably dashing nom de plume for a 
series of polemical articles on modern architecture. Although Le Corbusier 
broke with Ozenfant in 1925, his artistic influence was soon replaced by that 
of painter Fernand Leger, another friend. During his last couple of decades the 
controversial modernist hero of architecture occasionally incorporated in his 
art stylistic elements -- monstrous profiles, bullet-breasted women -- from the 
equally controversial modernist hero of painting, Picasso. 
</P>
<P>
Works on paper from the 1920s through 1965 (the year of Le Corbusier's death) 
are the product of a firm and deliberate touch that came to be absorbed by the 
minute quiddities of human anatomy. In "Deux Bouteilles et Livre" from 1928 -- 
a compact ink sketch on graph paper -- he still seems to be grappling for a 
geometric vocabulary adequate to convey his vision of real-life objects. His 
own voice comes through much more clearly in an undated ink drawing, "Femme 
Couchee," in which the squared hip of the woman, the necklace beads that echo 
her little round toes, and the pair of elegantly curved lines that describe the 
book she is reading are reminiscent of Leger but with a distinctive, suavely 
economical twist. 
</P>
<P>
In several pieces from the '50s, some incorporating effortlessly posed scraps 
of torn colored papers, Le Corbusier lingered on the human hand, tracking -- in 
his robustly stylized way -- the way the thumb curves or the shape of a 
fingernail or the puffiness of the individual pads of flesh on the palm. 
Perhaps this near-obsession was related to his architectural theory of 
"Modulor" (formulated in its final version in 1950), by which all his buildings 
were to incorporate a distinctively human scale. In any case, the work on view 
is for the most part wonderfully muscular, honest stuff, much more than a 
footnote to the famously ascetic buildings. (Fiorella Urbinati Gallery, 8818 
Melrose Ave., to April 30.)CATHY CURTIS

The world of Norman Schwab's mixed-media painting constructions is a gloomy and 
impoverished place, defined by black-painted pieces of cloth, bedraggled bits 
of string, twigs bound together to form skimpy triangles, black crosses in 
little boxes, sad photo-etched imagery (a sorrowful young man in the Army, 
innocent people gunned down by snipers) and incongruous swaths of wallpaper 
printed with little ducklings, which the artist paints over in various ways. 
</P>
<P>
There are pieces that convey an earnest attempt to create a particular mood and 
attitude, but too often it comes across as hollow and secondhand. Schwab 
borrows certain elements from arte povera -- the use of "poor" or "innocent" 
materials, a deliberate starkness -- but without being able to endow the work 
with the all-but-magical power it needs to make an overwhelming impression. As 
it happens, the concrete, undramatized images (mostly from newspaper 
photographs or snapshots) that Schwab incorporates into the works generally 
have a good deal more power than the ritualized settings he creates for them. 
</P>
<P>
A few pieces, however, offer an overall fresher approach. In "Demise of a 
Stone-Cutter," a wooden ammunition box filled with sharp stone shards in a bed 
of mulch and earth, Schwab combines various ideas and images -- war, a 
gravestone, futile attempts (at chipping the stone), craftsmanship and the 
shape and purpose of an individual life. 
</P>
<P>
Bay Area artist Barbara Milman's mixed-media works on paper are busy and 
bright. Layers of multi-directional little images -- skulls and hands and 
hearts and fish and crosses and heaven knows what else -- create a steady 
drumbeat that reads primarily as all-over pattern. For the most part, this 
bouillabaisse of familiar imagery does not seem have anything fresh to say. The 
more successful pieces are the ones (like "Patterns of Chaos" and "The Secret 
Garden") in which the broth is made up mostly of abstract markings and 
garnished with the steadying effect of superimposed black shapes. (Space, 6015

Tom Carr, a young artist based in Barcelona, Spain, engineers large and small 
architectural forms with blocks and strips of wood painted with lazy dribbles 
of bluish-white or blue-black paint. Some of the works in Carr's first American 
solo show are variations on a stairway theme. "Monument at Night," made (for 
some inexplicable reason) of partially splintered and gouged wood, is a chunky 
spiral of steps in which each tread diminishes in size and height as the 
stairway descends. "Shell" has a relentless flight of tiny stairs curling 
around an 11-foot-tall wooden matrix. 
</P>
<P>
Other pieces, made during the artist's recent stay in Los Angeles, are open 
forms -- like the floor piece, "Upside-Down Arch" and a nearly-12-foot-tall 
walk-in construction called "Wall with Passageway," defined by a pair of lanky 
arches and walls airily sketched in with two diamond-shaped arrangements of 
wood strips. The most recalcitrant work, "Dream I," is a half-hearted arc that 
pokes out from the wall, with little step-like notches dwindling into a skimpy, 
ragged promontory. Mixed-media drawings of spirals extend Carr's vocabulary 
into an ultra-purified, ultimately rather nebulous realm. 
</P>
<P>
As far as the three-dimensional pieces are concerned, any specific romantic 
association the viewer might want to make with monuments or moonlight or the 
stuff of dreams is counteracted by the repetitive coloristic and painterly 
treatment of the surfaces. And yet the studiously careless way the paint is 
applied gives the pieces a curiously wistful quality. The idea is, perhaps, 
that -- much as we want to do so -- it is no longer possible to believe 
seriously in the fancifully metaphoric side of architectural form. (Jan Baum 
Gallery, 170 S. La Brea Ave., to March 31.)CATHY CURTIS

New York newcomer Alfonse Pagano debuts in Los Angeles with inoffensively 
decorative works that combine canvas painting, sculpture and ideas from 
collage. He begins with oil on linen canvases painted with gestural royal 
blues, salmon pinks, rusts and grayed or acid teals frothed up and layered to 
look like New York School abstraction at its most light handed and romantic. To 
these canvases Pagano adds clusters of narrow, foot-long lengths of wood (like 
those scraps you use for stirring paint), their edges jagged as if cut to size 
with a quick blow over someone's knee. Painted in the same style and hues as 
the two-dimensional canvas grounds, the wood embellishments have an engaging 
way of both merging with flat forms and standing away as independent sculptural 
components. 
</P>
<P>
Whether scattered on works like 3-D versions of all-over gesture ("Rush to 
Relics") or bundled at one side of canvases like wheat sheaths tied and ready 
for market ("Spent Time Wasted Time"), Pagano's wood (and occasional barbed 
wire and copper) accents serve expressive and formal ends. In "Heros," wood 
takes the form of vaguely anthropomorphic cutouts mounted some distance from 
the slapdash canvas field and coiled in thin metal tubing to suggest fettered 
bodies or a literal shape overrunning the surface only to be contained by line. 
Initially Pagano's high-relief metallic looking finishes, colliding bits of 
rough-hewn wood, encaustic, copper and barbed wire concoctions look like 
distant cousins of junk sculpture, but they're too prettified and tamely 
wistful to be industrial art. (Wenger Gallery, 828 N. La Brea Ave., to March 
15.) MARLENA DONOHUE

Robert Barry is an artist who deals with the elusive, with things on the edge 
of comprehension. His interest in things at the threshold of perception led him 
in 1969 to make invisible conceptual installations of ultrasonic sounds or to 
release odorless, colorless gas in the Mojave Desert while ironically using 
photographs of the sites for documentation. A current show of his prints and 
paintings from the early 1980s incorporate faint words, precisely hand-lettered 
on intensely colored squares of paper or canvas. The color visually dissolves 
language and conveys some of the slippery nature of thought and understanding. 
</P>
<P>
The words on the largest pieces are written in a silvery graphite pencil that 
can be seen only up close and when the light strikes them at an angle. They run 
upside down and right side up at odd horizontal and vertical positions around 
the edges of the paper so that to read them all requires a lot of head craning. 
The words, such as risk, contradictions, leave behind, wish, and so on are 
open-ended yet emotionally descriptive. Hunting them out in the bright orange 
and deep red in order to absorb their meanings is curiously like tasting 
delicate flavors and gaining an appreciation for the way they go together to 
make an indescribable sensation akin to knowing. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in the center of the square is a faint, almost imperceptible image of 
a leaf-barren tree with exposed roots. The tree and an occasional doppelganger 
emerge from the color gradually, like a latent retinal image whose shape 
suggests both the optic nerve at the back of the eye and the branching diagrams 
used to analyze sentences in grammar school. As simple as these elements are, 
they form an ethereal experience touching on the limits of perception. (Roy 
Boyd Gallery, 1547 10th St., to March 30.)SUVAN GEER

WINNING COMPOSITIONS ALSO TO BE FEATURED AT CALARTS FESTIVAL

The Freeman Competition for Composers accepts entries from throughout the 
Western United States, so it was something of a coincidence that two of the 
three winners this year are from the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, John Naples of Toluca Lake and Brian Kehlenbach of Burbank live just a 
few miles from each other. But their winning compositions are a vast distance 
apart in origin and intent. 
</P>
<P>
Naples said "Juggernaut Variations," his 11-minute piece for solo clarinet, was 
written in three days and is designed as "something a virtuoso can sink his 
teeth into." Kehlenbach labored four months on "Times of Reflection," his 
10-minute composition for electric and acoustic piano, and he terms it an 
"interplay between a traditional instrument and the fruits of modern electronic 
music." 
</P>
<P>
The composers, along with the third winner, Haruna Aoki of Pasadena, will have 
their works performed Saturday afternoon at CalArts in Valencia. The concert is 
part of the school's annual Contemporary Music Festival, to be held today 
through Sunday. Aoki's work is for marimba with taped accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, the three will be the final Freeman winners. The competition, 
endowed by Betty Freeman of Los Angeles and run by CalArts, is being abandoned 
in favor of a scholarship at the school. The competition, open to composers 
under 35, awards $1,000 to each winner and pays the expense of producing a 
concert of their works. 
</P>
<P>
John Orders, assistant to CalArts President Steven Lavine, said the school 
asked Freeman to convert the endowment to a scholarship because rising tuition 
has made it difficult for many students to afford a CalArts education. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we will endow one full year's scholarship, which is $10,200 at our 
current tuition," Orders said. 
</P>
<P>
Naples and Kehlenbach agreed that the Freeman Competition, which drew 41 
entries this year, will be missed by young composers of serious contemporary 
music. 
</P>
<P>
"The concert is a real good showcase," said Kehlenbach, 30, a candidate for a 
doctorate in musical arts at USC. "It's part of the Contemporary Music 
Festival, which is a major event, so it's well-attended. Excellent performers 
play your piece, which is an added bonus." 
</P>
<P>
CalArts officials said they had hoped to stage the festival at the new Santa 
Monica Museum, but added that arrangements could not be completed in time. 
Efforts to make the move next year will continue because a Westside location 
could increase attendance, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Kehlenbach said there is no easy name for the music he writes. 
</P>
<P>
"You could call it art music or contemporary classical music," he said. "The 
main idea is that it's distinguished from commercial music. It's not a 
commercial venture by any stretch of the imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Kehlenbach said the name of his composition, "Times of Reflection," works on 
two levels. The mood of the piece is contemplative or reflective, and the 
writing uses electronic techniques to manipulate standard musical concepts of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"It extends the tonality of traditional piano through electronics," he said. 
"The two pianos start together and speak as one voice. In the center of the 
piece, they separate and the electronic piano becomes like an alter ego of the 
traditional piano. By the end, they are together again." 
</P>
<P>
Kehlenbach said he has been on pins and needles the past few weeks, 
anticipating the thrill that comes from hearing his work performed. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's very depressing to compose," he said. "You're struggling with 
what you're trying to express. It's often a very dark time. But this is the 
bright period for me." 
</P>
<P>
Naples, 34, has the opposite feeling about his work. He said "Juggernaut 
Variations" should leave listeners with a sense of inner calm, much as writing 
it did for him. He enjoys composing, which is one reason he works quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to keep going when I'm in that up spirit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Naples works at Screen Music International in Studio City, a firm that writes 
music for movies, commercials and industrial films. He has a bachelor's degree 
in classical guitar from State University of New York at Buffalo and a master's 
degree in composition from Cal State Long Beach. Neither school is widely 
recognized in music circles, a fact that only helps fuel his compulsion to 
write music. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for me to show that someone can come out of nowhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Naples sees his work as similar to that of composers John Adams and Steve 
Reich. He calls his style serial minimalism and said he didn't begin writing 
until 1982. In his teen-age years, he played classical piano and later turned 
to rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I left Buffalo for New York City; I wanted to go all the way with 
rock," he said. "I seriously thought I was going to get signed to a record 
contract. But the bands I was in never had that single-minded purpose that 
you've got to have to make it. Finally, one day I woke up and realized I'm not 
a rock and roller." 
</P>
<P>
Naples said he writes serious music "to express what I can't express otherwise. 
It's like being mute not to compose." 
</P>
<P>
His "Juggernaut Variations" will be performed by CalArts teacher Bill Powell, 
who encouraged Naples to enter the work in the Freeman Competition. 
</P>
<P>
Like Naples, Kehlenbach comes from the East Coast. He was raised in Hartford, 
Conn., and has been a lifetime devotee of composing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I've done since I was 8 years old and first put my hands on a 
keyboard," he said. "I always ignored the lessons I was supposed to practice 
and I'd interpret thoughts I had on the keyboard. A small idea gets in my head 
and I have to pursue it to its end." 
</P>
<P>
Kehlenbach left the staff of the Hartford Conservatory of Music when he was 
accepted into USC's doctoral program. He teaches two music theory classes at 
USC, and his wife is a junior high teacher for the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons I moved to Los Angeles is that I wanted to be around people 
who are interested in serious art music, and it's difficult to find them," he 
said. "You're better off in a city." 
</P>
<P>
He is fascinated by the possibilities that electronic technology offers in 
music and works late at night composing on USC's Synclavier, an $180,000 
digital synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
"The only time it's available is at night," he said. "That's why I have these 
dark circles under my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Because the three winning Freeman Competition pieces are relatively short, each 
of the composers will present a second work. Kehlenbach's is "Placations," 
written for two percussionists and a synthesizer with taped accompaniment. 
Naples' is "Histrionic Suite," featuring piano and clarinet. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors for the competition were Brian Serneyhough, a music teacher at UC San 
Diego; Charles Amirkanian, music director at KPFA in San Francisco, and Leonard 
Stein, director of the Schoenberg Institute at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the nice things about this year's competition is that the three winning 
pieces are totally different in aesthetics and styles," said Frans van Rossum, 
a CalArts faculty member who served as non-voting chairman of jury. "It's very 
fresh and lively music." 
</P>
<P>
 The Freeman Competition Concert is at 3 p.m. Saturday, Roy O. Disney Hall, 
CalArts, 24700 McBean Parkway, Valencia. Tickets are $6, $2 students and 
seniors. For information, call (805) 255-1050.

STUDENT'S FLAG ARTWORK PROVOKES UNPRECEDENTED CONTROVERSY AT CALARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
At first, no one paid much attention to the American flag tacked to the floor 
in the main lobby at CalArts. 
</P>
<P>
A few students paused to look at it. Steven Lavine, the school's president, 
glanced at it and continued on to his office. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first walked in," Lavine recalled, "I didn't think much of it one way 
or the other." 
</P>
<P>
But within a few days, that flag, the centerpiece of a student exhibit, 
unexpectedly drew CalArts into an artistic turmoil unparalleled in the Valencia 
school's 21-year history. 
</P>
<P>
The school received threatening phone calls from people who said the exhibit 
was unpatriotic. Staff members voiced similar protests, and the local American 
Legion picketed in front of the campus. Police advised school officials that 
the display might be violating state and federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
"People keep misreading this piece," said Adam Greene, the student who created 
it. "It's about censorship, not about anything else. It's about free speech. 
I've learned that a lot of people think symbols are more important than what 
they are supposed to stand for." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, two men walked into CalArts and snatched the flag, in effect closing 
the exhibit. But they could not end the debate over the issue of art, free 
speech and the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
"It began as an absurd situation that came to involve very real principles 
regarding what this country is about," said John Orders, assistant to the 
president at CalArts. "It came to involve the principles that are essential to 
free speech and artistic expression." 
</P>
<P>
Greene mounted the exhibit 1 1/2 weeks ago as a show of support for another art 
student, Scott Tyler, whose similar work at the School of the Art Institute of 
Chicago has been drawing vehement criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler's piece, "What Is the Proper Way to Display the American Flag?," included 
a flag draped on the floor and a ledger for comments. The exhibit made it 
difficult to offer comment without stepping on the flag. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 200 veterans demonstrated at the Chicago art institute, and school 
officials temporarily closed the exhibit. There was a brief court battle over 
the artwork, and a visitor to the exhibit was recently arrested for felony 
desecration of the flag because she stepped on the flag while writing comments. 
</P>
<P>
But that exhibit, unlike the one at CalArts, remains open. 
</P>
<P>
The most common argument against both exhibits has been that defiling the flag 
is a political statement, but not art. 
</P>
<P>
"I happen to be an artist; several members here are," said Armie Trujillo, 
commander of American Legion Post 507 in Newhall, which picketed the work. "We 
appreciate art for art's sake. I can take a set of keys and drop them on the 
table and say, 'That's art.' But to us, anything that has to do with treading 
on the flag, well, we don't consider it art." 
</P>
<P>
Yet people in the Los Angeles art community say aesthetic expression has become 
so varied in the 20th Century that virtually anything an artist proffers as art 
should be accepted as such. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at Marcel Duchamp, he basically took a toilet fixture and called 
it art," said Thomas Rhoads, director of the Santa Monica Museum of Art. "It 
wasn't art until he called it that. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what artists do," Rhoads said. "They basically select something from 
their environment -- they may put a frame around it or they may not -- and they 
bring it to the public's attention so that it takes on a greater import than it 
might have in everyday life." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Tyler and Greene were walking a well-beaten aesthetic path when 
they chose to display the flag in a new or controversial manner, said Howard 
Fox, curator of modern art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
"One thinks of the very important paintings that Jasper Johns did that were 
based on images of the American flag, or frequent appearances of the flag in 
pop art," Fox said. "Many artists today are interested in the power of certain 
signs or symbols to evoke strong cultural reactions. Use of the American flag 
is an artistic expression." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a New York artist named Ronnie Cutrone attracted protests of 
veterans with his show of cartoon figures, such as Woody Woodpecker, painted on 
American flags. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can get beyond the cutesy Looney Tunes vocabulary of Bugs and Tweedy," 
wrote Times critic Marlena Donohue, ". . . you find montages that elbow 
Americana (including the hallowed institution of art) in its most banal and 
self-important soft spots." 
</P>
<P>
But critical reviews and talk of art history don't wash with John Callaway. The 
22-year-old Canyon Country man took Greene's flag from CalArts and turned it in 
at a nearby sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
"I found it extremely offensive that this gentleman defiled the flag," Callaway 
said. "I have served in the military and I do believe in the principles on 
which this country is based. . . . I feel it was not only my right, but my 
responsibility to do what I did." 
</P>
<P>
Such sentiments were shared by others in the Santa Clarita Valley, a 
conservative, mostly Republican community. This is the kind of place where the 
local Brownie troop often stops by City Council meetings to lead the Pledge of 
Allegiance. The men at the American Legion hall were among the area's most 
vocal protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll have to understand that most of the people here are very patriotic," 
Trujillo said. "We felt it was an affront to us as patriots." 
</P>
<P>
CalArts officials have tried to stay clear of the debate, but steadfastly stand 
behind Greene's right to expression. The school has only three criteria for 
student exhibits: They may not break the law, damage or alter another student's 
work, or jeopardize anyone's physical well-being. Orders said CalArts has never 
otherwise restricted student work. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have to have, in a sense, a censorship board to look at every 
project," Orders said. "It would be a travesty to get to that point." 
</P>
<P>
Administrators admit that the recent uproar caused a goodly number of headaches 
and hassles around campus. But Lavine is pleased that Greene used his art to 
address a challenging subject. 
</P>
<P>
"It has always been one of the functions of art to raise hard questions and to 
provoke discussion," Lavine said. "This is a work of art whose real content is 
not the flag, but the debate. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, without the flag, the debate is still going on."

AT CSUN, THE VERY MODEL OF A MAN OF GENIUS -- DA VINCI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The inventions sketched by Leonardo da Vinci in more than 8,000 pages of 
personal notes testify to the brilliance of the 15th-Century painter, who 
envisioned such possibilities as helicopters, automobiles, hydraulics and 
robots. 
</P>
<P>
But wind up, crank, push or pump one of the working models that go on exhibit 
Monday at Cal State Northridge and the true genius of the Renaissance man comes 
to life. 
</P>
<P>
"At first you see them as inert, immobile objects," said Donald Strong, a 
professor of art history at CSUN. "But when his machines are working, they are, 
in fact, living machines." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four replicas of the devices, including a paddle-wheel ship, odometer, 
drill press, pile driver and parachute, will be at CSUN's Fine Arts Gallery 
through April 14. The models, on loan from a collection begun in 1951 by IBM, 
are all "hands-on" exhibits, made from wood and brass, standing several feet 
tall. 
</P>
<P>
Grab the crank of a scaling ladder and spin the large, toothed gear until all 
the sections are extended. Da Vinci was thinking in terms of scaling the wall 
of an enemy fortress, but the device clearly predates modern firefighting 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Turn the handle on one of his many gear systems -- machines more theoretical 
than practical in his day -- and see how da Vinci used several cogs to simulate 
what today might be called a variable-speed transmission. 
</P>
<P>
And don't forget to spin the wheels on the military tank, an armored capsule 
intended for carrying heavy firepower and to be driven from within by men with 
cranks. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all movement with a purpose," said Strong, who will lecture about the 
devices at 10 a.m. March 27 in the Fine Arts Gallery. "He believed he had the 
power to design something that had a living presence because it obeyed the same 
laws of operation as anything created by nature itself. In Leonardo's mind, man 
created on a par with nature." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, da Vinci was not the only man of his day weighing the heady ideas 
that made the 15th Century one of the most colorful, vital periods in history. 
But what made da Vinci unique, say scholars, was his extraordinary gift for 
synthesis, visualizing the relationships between art, medicine, music, 
engineering and the forces of nature. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1452 near Florence, Italy, da Vinci was the illegitimate son of a 
notary and, as such, was not permitted to attend the local university. Instead, 
he studied painting and gained the artistic perspective that allowed him to 
record with such precision the wonders of the world he lived in. 
</P>
<P>
He dissected corpses to learn human anatomy, observed birds to design flying 
machines, studied architecture to make maps, and mastered optics and color so 
that his paintings, such as the "Mona Lisa," radiate with warmth and intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"For him, art and science were the same, and their purpose was to lead to 
truth, to an understanding of the secrets of man and of the universe," writes 
Richard McLanathan in the IBM catalogue that accompanies the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no better example of that quest can be found than in da Vinci's 
notebooks, which by the time he died in 1519 were filled with inventions 
ranging from the practical to the fantastic, from the gruesome to the sublime. 
</P>
<P>
The modern models are the work of Roberto Guatelli, an engineer from Milan who 
was commissioned in the late 1930s by Benito Mussolini to replicate 156 of the 
devices. All of them were destroyed in bombing raids during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
But after the war, Guatelli came to the United States, where he built another 
56 models for a show that opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 
1950. The following year, IBM hired Guatelli to continue making the models, and 
for the last four decades they have been on almost continual tour in this 
country and around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like he is my dead grandfather," Guatelli once said of da Vinci. "If he 
were here, he would chase me around the block yelling, 'What are you doing to 
my work?' " 
</P>
<P>
"Leonardo da Vinci: The Inventions" will be on display Monday through April 14 
at the Fine Arts Gallery at Cal State Northridge, 18111 Nordhoff St. Gallery 
hours are noon to 4 p.m. Mondays, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays, 
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. March 18 and April 1 and 8, and noon to 4 p.m. April 9. 
Admission is free.

ANGKOR WAT IS A TEMPLE OF CAMBODIAN CUISINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angkor Wat in Cambodia was once a vast, intricate planned community built by 
the kings of the ancient Khmer Empire. Ransacked and burned hundreds of years 
ago, its exquisitely designed and carved sandstone palaces, monuments and 
temples sank back into the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
I have only seen photographs of various wats (temples) and, unforgettably, a 
colossal stone carving of Vishnu's serene countenance sitting on the forest 
floor wrapped in the thick roots of tropical trees. A woman I know who visited 
Angkor in the early 1960s, before the Cambodian borders were closed, described 
it as "total ruins . . . and probably the most beautiful place in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, while dreaming up future travel adventures, I remarked that I wanted 
to go to Angkor Wat. Call it prescience, coincidence, fate or synchronicity, 
but a week after I expressed this wish, I was sent on the job to the new Angkor 
Wat restaurant on Ventura Boulevard. In my daydreaming, I neglected to specify 
Angkor Wat, Cambodia. Once I had a spoonful of samlaw ktiss manors, a thick, 
sublime, velvety soup made with chicken, pineapple, red curry and tamarind, I 
was truly content to be in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
Even if I had been able to visit Cambodia as a tourist, it is unlikely that I 
would have had the opportunity to sample this luscious soup for the simple 
reason that there are no Cambodian restaurants in Cambodia. Traditional 
Cambodian cuisine is eaten exclusively at home. What restaurants existed there 
did so only during the French colonial period and did not feature the Khmer 
cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Cambodians living in the United States found the concept of 
restaurants offering their indigenous cuisine unlikely, if not downright 
distasteful. But the entrepreneurial possibilities were increasingly 
attractive, and the first Cambodian restaurant "in history," Phnom Penh, was 
opened in San Francisco in 1982. I consider it great luck that another one of 
these still-rare restaurants sits within easy driving distance of my home. 
</P>
<P>
Cambodian cuisine is spicy, delicate, refreshing, fragrant, utterly dependent 
on fresh ingredients. When my friend Amy took her first bite of plear bangker, 
a refreshing salad of chopped prawns, bean sprouts and fresh herbs, she 
exclaimed: "Yes, this is the kind of food I always want to eat!" 
</P>
<P>
A friendly young Cambodian couple preside over Angkor Wat's comfortable, spare, 
quietly attractive dining room. They cheerfully answer questions, warn you when 
you may have ordered a bit too much food and administer a bit of first aid when 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Everything we ate was fresh and delicious and surprising. Amy and I agreed that 
the prawn salad was our favorite appetizer, but the slightly denser, slightly 
puckery green papaya, pork and shrimp salad ran a close second. Little 
finger-sized, meat-stuffed spring rolls came with delicious, spicy, lightly 
pickled assorted vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
I suspect that Cambodian food is probably a little hotter than what we were 
served at Angkor Wat. When our waitress delivered our soup, she warned us to 
avoid the red chilies floating in it. For some of us, this was warning enough. 
</P>
<P>
Phil resisted the chilies in the soup, but could not resist the one he found in 
the otherwise mildly hot and fabulous spicy beef with fresh, sweet basil. When 
he was drenched in sweat, had drained all the water glasses and could begin to 
speak, he confessed, "I saw it, I knew what it was, and I ate it." His 
discomfort was so obvious, the waitress deduced it from afar and brought him a 
small plate of sliced pineapple to quench the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Phil recovered rapidly, spurred on by the fact that other entrees were 
disappearing at an alarming rate. He was especially fond of the much more 
delicately flavored pork with egg and winter melon, which looks and tastes like 
a large cucumber. 
</P>
<P>
Fish dishes ranged from the very light to the very rich. A steamed filet of 
sole with bean threads and banana blossoms was almost Japanese in flavor. The 
halibut in red curry sauce with baby onions and carrots tasted strongly of 
coconut milk and was a little too rich for my blood, although Amy loved it. 
</P>
<P>
Angkor Wat offers two wonderful desserts. There are fried bananas served with a 
cream custard and flamed at the table with Grand Marnier, and a jackfruit 
custard. The custard is also flavored strongly with coconut, but it's topped 
with shreds of jackfruit, which is the big, smooth melon-type fruit one often 
sees in photographs of Far Eastern markets. I was delighted to find its flavor 
mild, but strangely compelling. Amy reminded me that whenever one eats a new 
fruit, one gets to make a wish. My last wish, you might remember, was to visit 
Angkor Wat. This time, I wished I'd get to come back soon. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: nohrm lahong (papaya, pork and prawns in light lime sauce), 
$4.45; plear bangker (prawn salad with fresh herbs), $5.45; samlaw ktiss manors 
(spicy red curry chicken soup with pineapple and tamarind broth), $6.25; spicy 
beef with fresh sweet basil, $6.75; steamed filet of sole, bean thread, ginger 
and banana blossoms, $7.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Angkor Wat, 16161 Ventura Blvd., Encino. (818) 990-8491. Open 11 a.m. to 10 
p.m. Mondays through Saturdays, 5 to 10 p.m. Sundays. American Express, 
MasterCard and Visa accepted. Beer and wine. Dinner for two, food only, $15 to

Imagine owning your own copy of "Imagine: John Lennon," last year's 
theatrically shown documentary about the legendary singer, songwriter and 
ex-Beatle. Well, the film is out on video this week from Warner Home Video 
(MPAA rating: R) -- but you'll just have to keep on imagining ownership of the 
tape . . . unless you want to come up with $89.95. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for collectors, Warner has chosen a rental-oriented price rather 
than opting for a sell-through tag (usually $20-$30). That's especially bad 
news for rock music fans who'd skipped buying the "Imagine: John Lennon" 
compact disc when it was released at the time of the theatrical run. The CD 
left off several songs available on the video's digitally processed, hi-fi 
stereo sound track. 
</P>
<P>
The $90 tag means less affluent Lennon fans will have to wait even longer to 
purchase the tape -- until Warner reduces the price, in several months at the 
earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Warner is simultaneously releasing the 1978 movie "I Want to Hold Your Hand" 
($79.95, PG). Though the Beatles don't star (it's a fictional film about six 
teen-agers desperate for tickets to the group's 1964 appearance on the Ed 
Sullivan Show), the film does have some interesting features: Robert Zemeckis 
("Who Framed Roger Rabbit") directed; Steven Spielberg served as executive 
director; and many critics, while not raving, found the film mildly enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Playhouse Video, a subsidiary of CBS/Fox, released a batch of 
Shirley Temple films, and this week another nine skip into video stores ($19.98 
each). The child star is not the only thing minor about some of them, but among 
the more interesting are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Wee Willie Winkie" (1937). India-set Kipling tale directed by John Ford. 
Unfortunately, the original 99-minute version has not been restored; this print 
runs 76 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Captain January" (1936). Not a great film, but one of the most fondly 
remembered for its lighthouse/fishing-port setting and Buddy Ebsen's ebullient 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The Little Princess" (1939). For its Victorian setting and colorful 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Stand Up and Cheer," "Bright Eyes," "Baby, Take a Bow" (all 1934). Three 
films where Shirley was very young and not quite so sure of herself; many fans 
find she had a special charm at this stage. Shirley is only sporadically 
featured in "Stand Up and Cheer," but this wild Depression lampoon is notable 
for its hodgepodge of surreal comedy acts and oddball musical numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining Temples: "Our Little Girl" (1935), "Susannah of the Mounties" and 
"The Blue Bird" (1940), the last a flawed but occasionally pleasing attempt to 
cash in on "The Wizard of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
Other new cassettes include two TV movies, "Mayflower Madam" (Vidmark, $79.95), 
a toned-down version of Sydney Biddle Barrows' book with Candice Bergen as 
Barrows, and "Steal the Sky" (HBO, $89.99), a weak telling of a potentially 
exciting story -- how an Israeli secret-service agent (Mariel Hemingway) got an 
Iraqi pilot to fly his Soviet-made MIG to Israel and defect. Also new is 
another fighter-jet movie, "Iron Eagle II" (IVE, $89.95, PG). 
</P>
<P>
Other Videos 
</P>
<P>
Cartoon fans, Atten-shun! 
</P>
<P>
Six new tapes are led by "Bugs &amp; Daffy: The Wartime Cartoons" (MGM/UA, 
$19.95). Fascinating both for their frantic humor and their World War II 
propaganda, these 11 cartoons, many rarely seen, include such gems as "Falling 
Hare" (Bugs vs. a gremlin), "Draftee Daffy" (the duck tries to escape the man 
from the draft board), and "Swooner Crooner" (Porky Pig, present despite his 
lack of billing in the video title, gets his chickens to lay eggs with the help 
of a Crosby-like singer). Film/animation historian Leonard Maltin hosts. 
</P>
<P>
Three other collections from MGM/UA are "Bugs Bunny Classics," "Tweety &amp; 
Sylvester" and "Just Plain Daffy," each $14.95, about an hour long, and highly 
recommended. Of considerably less interest are two tapes from Warner, "Bugs and 
Daffy's Carnival of the Animals" and "Bugs Bunny in King Arthur's Court," each 
a $14.95, 24-minute TV special from the late '70s. TERRY ATKINSON

CD CORNER: DO HOMEWORK ON 'BEST OF' PACKAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you've been moved enough by Roy Orbison's recent work with the Traveling 
Wilburys or his posthumous "Mystery Girl" album to buy a CD of his original 
hits, be prepared for some confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Ask a record store clerk for a copy of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member's 
"greatest hits" and you could end up with five albums in your hands, four of 
which are drawn from same '60s Monument recordings. 
</P>
<P>
This may be an extreme example, but duplication isn't unusual in the CD world, 
which is heavily focused on catalogue product. That's why it is important for 
consumers to do some research before buying "best of" packages, especially 
those by '50s and '60s artists. 
</P>
<P>
Just because only one "best of" collection is in a particular store, don't 
assume that is the only one available. A good source for determining what is on 
the market is the Schwann CD catalogue, a monthly guide that lists more than 
20,000 CDs. It is sold in numerous record stores or you can obtain information 
about it by phoning 1-800-446-3563. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how the Orbison collection grew. 
</P>
<P>
Virgin Records signed the creator of such hits as "Only the Lonely" and "Oh 
Pretty Woman" in 1987 with the idea of re-introducing Orbison as a contemporary 
artist. As part of the campaign, the company put out a greatest hits package 
late that year. But the album -- "In Dreams: Greatest Hits" -- features 
re-recorded versions of the classic songs. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing that the original versions were still not available in a domestic CD, 
Rhino Records -- the masters of retrospectives -- secured the rights to the 
recordings from Columbia Records, which now owns the Monument tracks. The 
result last fall was the release of "For the Lonely: 18 Greatest Hits." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, Columbia released two of its own "greatest hits" packages 
featuring the Monument recordings. Each budget CD contained 10 songs and sold 
for about $10. Now that interest has mushroomed around the late singer, 
Columbia's Special Projects department has combined the 20 songs from the two 
budget volumes into a single, full-price CD. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Columbia has released three other theme-related Orbison packages, 
assembled from remaining Monument materials: "Best-Loved Standards" (including 
"I Can't Stop Loving You," "Bye Bye Love" and "Let the Good Times Roll"), "Our 
Love Songs" (mostly written by Orbison) and "Rare Orbison" (various tunes, most 
of which have never appeared on a domestic album). 
</P>
<P>
Recommendations: Of the greatest hits packages, go with Rhino's "For the Lonely 
. . . " because it contains all nine of Orbison's Top 10 hits and two of his 
earlier rockabilly efforts for Sun Records. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three new packages, "Best-Loved Standards" is the most revealing -- a 
marvelous demonstration of Orbison's ability to move between country, pop and 
rock genres. There's a teasing hint of "Running Scared" tension in his 
treatment of "No One Will Ever Know" and a wonderful tenderness to "Beautiful 
Dreamer." 
</P>
<P>
MORE CHOICES: Atlantic Records has just added four more "best of" collections 
to its "Super Savers" budget line. All contain 12 songs and retail for about 
$12. The new releases are "The Bobby Darin Story" ("Early in the Morning," 
"Mack the Knife"), "The Best of Aretha Franklin" ("Respect," "Rock Steady"), 
"The Best of Percy Sledge" ("When a Man Loves a Woman," "Take Time to Know 
Her") and "The Best of Wilson Pickett" ("In the Midnight Hour," "Funky 
Broadway"). Again, however, there are alternatives: higher priced, but also 
more comprehensive sets for all four artists. The most ambitious is "Aretha's 
30 Greatest Hits," also on Atlantic, which retails for about $24.

PUBLIC ENEMY RAPS THE SYSTEM

Critics' choice. According to the Village Voice, the No. 1 album band in the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
Public Enemy, that is -- deejay Terminator-X, emcees Flavor Flav and Chuck D -- 
brought its hip-hop sounds to town Thursday night, and UCLA's Ackerman Ballroom 
was the site, where black and white, college and street kids alike heard the 
word that disturbs and distills all the anger and fear that a young black 
person must feel on the street, in the schools and the jails when the System 
fails to take heed of those people in need. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murder is the No. 1 cause of death among black males under 25." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Los Angeles Times, March 9 
</P>
<P>
Boyeeee, this music is an outlet for the rage and the message of those denied 
access to any other medium. It speaks to its audience in a way that is clear to 
them about what a waste it is to freebase or watch television. About pride in 
one's race and one's history. About media hype and economic self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nearly three of every four black children live in poverty, more than half in 
single-parent homes." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Yo, the music is an angry, harsh, noisy bed, with razor-sharp cuts that go 
upside your head where Flavor Flav's jokin' and Chuck D's stentorian delivery 
merge with the urge to move your feet to the beat of the boots of the 
Uzi-toting honor guard that accompanied the 90 minutes' worth of facts that 
were rapidly rapped to a half-capacity crowd that was rapt and wowed by those 
with the courage to say what's on black minds in 1989. Terminator-X, bring the 
noise! DON WALLER

FROM MIGHTY MICHELIN, LE CROCODILE GAINS THAT THIRD STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 80th edition of the venerable Michelin food and travel guide was published 
in France on Thursday with the news that Le Crocodile in Strasbourg, has been 
added to the guide's three-star ranking. The newest member of the Michelin 
firmament brings the guide's number of three-star restaurants in France to just 
19 restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Le Crocodile, founded about 1790, was bought by its present owner/chef, Emile 
Jung, in 1971. Jung earned his first Michelin star at the restaurant the 
following year, and his second star in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Shut out of the three-star category was Paris' long-favored three-star 
candidate, Guy Savoy, which almost every established French critic argues is 
among the best and most consistent restaurants in France. 
</P>
<P>
Paris is also abuzz over the demotion of four prominent two-star restaurants 
that were dropped to one star. They include the Chantecler at the Hotel 
Negresco in Nice (penalized because its high-profile chef, Jacques Maximin, 
left to open his own restaurant) and the Beau Rivage Condrieu, whose longtime 
patronne, Paulette Castaing, retired last year and sold the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The guide, available in the United States in April, is expected to sell for 
$17.95. COLMAN ANDREWS

'MILLER BAND REUNION' SOUNDS AN AUTHENTIC NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though it's more of a salute than a reunion, "The Glenn Miller Band Reunion" 
(airing at 9:05 tonight on Channels 28 and 15, Saturday at 8 p.m. on Channel 
50) still has a pleasing ring of authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
True, only six former Miller band members are on hand -- trumpeters John Best 
and Zeke Zarchy, bassist Rolly Bundock, reedman Willie Schwartz, trombonist 
Jimmy Priddy and musical director Billy May -- in this Gary Halvorson-directed 
program, but the arrangements by May and Eddie Koch are based on transcriptions 
from original Miller charts. And while singer-host Jack Jones seems strangely 
out of place, the spiffy vocal group, String of Pearls, is right on the money. 
</P>
<P>
Filmed before an audience at Hollywood's Aquarius Theatre, "Reunion" is mostly 
a music presentation that finds the May-led big band, Jones, guest singers Kay 
Starr and Ray McKinley and String of Pearls delivering one Miller favorite 
after another. 
</P>
<P>
Interspersed with the musical numbers are snippets of archival footage and 
still photos, plus some recent interviews with former Miller musicians. The 
interviews are often humorous and informative, giving the non-cognoscenti some 
idea who Miller was -- the Swing Era's most popular bandleader before his 
disappearance on a flight from England to France in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
The instrumentals -- "In the Mood," "Sun Valley Jump" and "Pennsylvania 6-5000" 
among them -- have a sure-footed smoothness, due to May's first-class writing 
and to the zesty solos from tenor saxophonists Don Lodice and Bob Cooper and 
trumpeter Zeke Zarchy. 
</P>
<P>
Caveat: The sound on the review copy provided to The Times was only fair, and 
while sources at KCET said audio on the broadcast would be first-class stereo, 
it may not be. ZAN STEWART

VATICAN TELLS U.S. BISHOPS TO BECOME TOUGHER TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

VATICAN CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Pope John Paul II looked on, senior Vatican cardinals Thursday ordered U.S. 
bishops to combat the secular influence of American society on religion by 
being tougher teachers of their faith. 
</P>
<P>
On the second day of an extraordinary conference with the Pope, the three dozen 
American prelates and members of the Vatican Curia got down to theological 
brass tacks. American preoccupation with the difficulties of evangelization in 
a free-thinking democratic society was countered by Vatican insistence that the 
bishops strengthen their resolve rather than accommodate it to the secularism 
of modern America. 
</P>
<P>
"The Vatican rejects the pick-and-choose kind of K mart Catholicism so 
prevalent in the United States," Father John Navone, a Jesuit theologian at the 
Pontifical Gregorian University, said. "It is telling the bishops their job is 
to communicate the real things, not fashionable counterfeits." 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Joseph A. Ratzinger, who as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine 
of the Faith is the Vatican's principal theological disciplinarian, warned the 
Americans against allowing their teaching authority to be usurped by academic 
theologians, or their leadership role reduced to that of mere "spiritual 
administrators." 
</P>
<P>
He told the bishops they must reimpose their authority over dissent within the 
church, if necessary risking even greater dissent in the process. A summary of 
Ratzinger's theme-setting remarks, made at Wednesday's opening session, was 
made public Thursday. Americans had hoped to publicize the full texts of all 
the speeches at the 10 working sessions, but the Vatican demurred, preferring 
one-page summaries and press briefings by a spokesman for each side. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's theologians have an influence not only in the environment of 
scientific research and university teaching, but through the mass media bring 
to the public arena a concert dissonant to the point that their voices drown 
out that of the bishop evangelist," Ratzinger warned. "In many parts of the 
world, theologians have taken the place of bishops as teachers, engendering a 
growing insecurity and disorientation." 
</P>
<P>
Ratzinger, who is sometimes called the "deputy Pope," though not to his face, 
told the bishops: "It is necessary to risk being unpopular because of the 
truth. . . . It is worth suffering for the truth. In the deepest sense of the 
word, the evangelist must also be a martyr." 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, one of the American delegates, said: 
"To me, the important message of Cardinal Ratzinger's remarks was stressing the 
bishop's key role as messenger of the Gospel. We must recognize the danger in 
modern times of simply becoming managers. The Vatican is challenging us to make 
the message relevant and appealing . . . how to get the attention of people 
reaching for another Bud Light." 
</P>
<P>
Three sessions Thursday dealt with the role of priests as agents of 
evangelization, the pastoral role of bishops in religious life and a discussion 
of liturgy and the sacraments, with emphasis on confession. The Vatican, 
resolute for one-on-one confessions, makes no secret of its dislike of a 
growing American tendency toward general or group absolution. 
</P>
<P>
"Thursday was a great day," Mahony said. "Particularly the discussion on 
priests gave us a very useful overview." 
</P>
<P>
After formal presentations, one by an American and one by a member of the 
Curia, the Vatican's administrative arm, the prelates discuss the issues in a 
seminar-like session in the presence of the Pope. 
</P>
<P>
"About 85% of the time, we Americans are talking to each other. They're 
listening to us, and we're listening to each other," said Mahony. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's session on the priesthood, Curia Cardinal Antonio Innocenti told 
the American bishops they need to better support their priests, some of whom, 
he said, endure "personal identity crises." Some American priests are receiving 
theological training "inadequate for the needs and challenges of the times," 
Innocenti said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a decline in vocations in the United States, priests must be chosen 
with "acute discernment," said Innocenti, adding that American priests must 
also "deal with loss of prestige and consideration of the priestly mission in 
American society." 
</P>
<P>
Mahony said: "He talked about the disorientation of priests before conflicting 
ecclesiastical models. I think he's right. Some priests don't know which way to 
go. We need to support them better." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the Americans, Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston characterized 
American priests as "an extraordinarily faithful group who have been called to 
evangelize in uniquely challenging times and have done so effectively, despite 
significant pressures on their morale." 
</P>
<P>
Their mission of evangelization, Law said, is complicated in the United States 
today by exaggerated emphasis on egoism, "which undermines marriage and family 
life." He said priests are also challenged by aspects of American culture, 
including "the isolation of sexual pleasure as an end in itself, a climate of 
moral and intellectual relativism." 
</P>
<P>
Law called on bishops to be particularly supportive of American priests to help 
them meet demanding problems such as celibacy, "which requires ever-greater 
support for priests," and the diminishing public role of the priest. 
</P>
<P>
The conference, which was called to ease strains between the American church 
and its traditionalist central authority at the Vatican, will continue today, 
with sessions on the laity, the family, the young and the training of priests. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, two final sessions will consider ecumenism and the use of the mass 
media for evangelization. The conference, the first extended session of its 
kind between the church of 53 million Americans and its obedience-demanding 
leader, will conclude with a papal address Saturday afternoon.

EASTERN FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY, BLAMES PILOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Eastern Airlines, virtually grounded by a machinists walkout and the refusal of 
pilots to cross picket lines, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Thursday in an 
effort to survive its financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The action came on the sixth day of the crippling strike, which was costing the 
airline an estimated $4 million a day. 
</P>
<P>
"The pilots' strike has not only paralyzed our operation and severely 
inconvenienced customers, but has precipitated a looming cash crisis at Eastern 
that can only be avoided, regrettably, by bankruptcy protection," said Phil 
Bakes, airline president and chief executive, at a news conference after the 
filing of the Eastern petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Union to Expand Picketing 
</P>
<P>
The machinists' union responded to the court action by announcing it would 
spread its picketing to Continental Airlines, which union officials alleged is 
doing "struck work" of Eastern employees. Both Eastern and Continental are 
subsidiaries of Texas Air Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy filing gives Eastern temporary protection from its creditors 
while it tries to survive the bitter labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Since the strike by 8,500 mechanics and baggage handlers began in the face of 
company attempts to cut wages, Eastern has laid off all but 1,500 non-union 
employees. The airline employed more than 30,000 people before the strike. 
Eastern had attempted to have a walkout by pilots declared an illegal separate 
strike but Tuesday a U.S. District judge ruled against the airline. 
</P>
<P>
The court action was the second time that Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air 
Corp., put one of his airlines into bankruptcy proceedings. He employed a 
similar tactic in 1983 when Continental filed for protection under federal 
bankruptcy laws. At that time, he used the petition to abrogate union contracts 
with the carrier's flight attendants, pilots and machinists. 
</P>
<P>
Continental was reorganized and came out of bankruptcy, paying much lower wages 
and functioning without union contracts. Unions have since complained that 
Lorenzo has strapped Eastern by transferring assets to Continental. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo's success in eliminating Continental's union contracts will be far more 
difficult to duplicate with Eastern. Faced with outrage from organized labor, 
Congress altered the bankruptcy code to make it harder for management to use 
bankruptcy courts to break union agreements. A bankrupt company must convince 
the court that it needs cuts in wages to function. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some bankruptcy lawyers and analysts speculated that Eastern needs such 
relief. "When you've got hundreds of millions in losses for last year alone, I 
don't think Eastern will have a hard time persuading them it's got to have some 
adjustment in the labor costs," said Martin I. Klein, a New York bankruptcy 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Before the strike, Eastern was losing $1.5 million daily. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the International Assn. of Machinists condemned the bankruptcy 
filing. "Frank Lorenzo is taking his final vengeance out on the workers who 
stood up against his atrocities," said John Peterpaul, union vice president. 
"And he did it on pay day in a spiteful attempt to deny Eastern workers their 
last paycheck earned before the strike." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reorganization Plan 
</P>
<P>
Peterpaul said the union is drafting a reorganization plan that it will submit 
to the bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots' union also responded to Bakes' charges. "All Lorenzo has to do is 
look in the mirror to see who is responsible for the Chapter 11 filing," said 
Ron Cole, a spokesman for the Eastern local of the Air Line Pilots Assn. He 
said that talks between the pilots and management, which had been scheduled for 
Thursday, did not take place because "the company was a no-show." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Henry A. Duffy, national president of the Air Line Pilots Assn., said in 
an interview on Cable News Network that "we wish Lorenzo would go away. He is 
much better at filing for bankruptcy than he is at running an airline." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy said he hoped that the airline would be sold to "someone who knows how to 
run an airline" but would not rule out further negotiations with Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
Under Chapter 11, a company reorganizes under a trustee but continues to 
operate. During this period the company has protection from having to pay 
creditors. Airline observers expect that the reorganization might take as long 
as two years and once it is completed, Eastern will probably be a much smaller 
airline than it is today. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts expect to see an Eastern in a few months that is concentrated 
around its key routes and its big-money making lines, such as the Northeast 
shuttle between Washington, New York and Boston. Daniel A. Hersh, an airline 
analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards of Los Angeles, said he expects 
Eastern to give priority to keeping routes in its home base in Miami and its 
highly profitable service to South America, which it purchased from Braniff 
International Airways when that airline went bankrupt some years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A pale and unsmiling Lorenzo, guarded by security men, appeared at the news 
conference with Bakes. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has been labeled a "robber baron" by the unions, Lorenzo said that 
"the intensive focus on a single person does a great injustice to the real 
issues that are at stake in airline deregulation and in our business climate 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Both executives said they were saddened by the action they contended they were 
forced to take. Lorenzo once worked as a financial analyst for Eastern. "When I 
joined Eastern . . . I never believed I'd be at this press conference today," 
he said. "I'm not going to try to kid you by saying the attacks haven't hurt my 
family and me." 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo vowed that all creditors will be paid in full and that the shareholders 
will receive full value. He said that the net assets of the airline are "well 
over $1 billion after meeting all our obligations." He said that Eastern had 
$2.5 billion in debt but only about $200 million in cash. Texas Air had another 
$300 million, said Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
The largest Eastern creditors were identified as a consortium of European 
banks, the European plane manufacturer Airbus Industrie and several engine 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
The strike has shut down all but 4% of Eastern's flights. Of those flying, 
mostly in the Northeast corridor, only a handful of passengers appear to be 
taking them. 
</P>
<P>
Several passengers arriving at Washington National Airport from New York's La 
Guardia Airport cited convenience as the main reason for flying Eastern's 
shuttle. Ray Post said he flew on it because it was the first flight to 
Washington. "It was completely a matter of convenience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the emptiest shuttle flight I've ever been on," said Post, a Washington 
businessman who has been flying the shuttle for 10 years. Only 15 other 
passengers flew with Post aboard Eastern Flight 1481. 
</P>
<P>
The passengers interviewed said they enjoyed the relative solitude aboard 
Eastern's shuttle. "It was uncrowded and no hassle," another passenger said. "I 
knew Pan Am would be crowded and frantic." 
</P>
<P>
Other passengers said they were not concerned about the airline's safety. "It 
was an Eastern pilot, an Eastern flight attendant, and an Eastern shuttle," 
said Leland Schwartz, a Washington resident. Schwartz said the only unpleasant 
aspect of his flight was having to watch angry picketers. 
</P>
<P>
A group of four Eastern pilots supporting machinists spent Thursday in the 
airport terminal photographing their fellow pilots still working as Eastern 
flights pulled up to the terminal. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to find out who's not our friends anymore," said a pilot armed with a 
camera with a zoom lens. "We try to talk to them in a friendly manner and try 
to convince them not to fly," said the pilot, who declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland showed his support for the strikers by visiting 
the picket line at Washington National Airport. Kirkland criticized Lorenzo's 
"indifference" to Eastern employees and said the bankruptcy was "entirely 
predictable" because Lorenzo had abused the airline.

FRAUD FIGURE CONFESSES PAYING BRIBE TO PAISLEY; 
</P>
<P>
GUILTY PLEA IMPLICATING FORMER ASSISTANT NAVY SECRETARY SEEN AS BREAKTHROUGH IN 
DEFENSE PROBE

<P>
In a major breakthrough in the Pentagon fraud case, a former vice president of 
the Unisys Corp. pleaded guilty Thursday to bribing then-high-ranking Navy 
official Melvyn R. Paisley to win multimillion-dollar Defense Department 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The executive, Charles F. Gardner, admitted that he had directed an associate 
in 1986 to use company funds to buy Paisley's Sun Valley, Ida., condominium at 
an inflated price in return for preferential treatment on Navy and Marine Corps 
business. 
</P>
<P>
A guilty plea entered by the Gardner associate, James G. Neal, a Unisys 
consultant, implicated a previously unnamed sixth Pentagon official in 
wrongdoing. The official is retired Navy engineer Garland Tomlin Jr. When 
serving in the Pentagon, according to Neal's plea, Tomlin received $400,000 in 
bribes directed by Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
The new pleas provide prosecutors with their strongest evidence to date 
implicating Paisley in the massive fraud case. Paisley, a former assistant 
secretary of the Navy who later became a successful defense industry 
consultant, is the highest-ranking target of the 2 1/2-year investigation. His 
lawyer strongly denied any wrongdoing by Paisley. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner's plea agreement, which included a pledge to cooperate with the 
government, gives prosecutors a potential star witness to testify against other 
defendants when cases produced by the extensive investigation come to trial. 
</P>
<P>
"These are significant developments," said U.S. Attorney Henry E. Hudson, who 
has been directing the investigation from his office in Alexandria, Va. "The 
cooperation we get . . . from individuals will advance the case substantially." 
</P>
<P>
However, the government's willingness to strike a plea bargain with Gardner 
shocked some people close to the inquiry. "I can't believe it," one defense 
lawyer said. "This sounds like a desperation move." 
</P>
<P>
As a government target, Gardner, a highly placed corporate officer associated 
with many of the figures under investigation, was believed to rank in priority 
only behind Paisley and influential consultant William M. Galvin. 
</P>
<P>
However, Thursday's pleas also implicate Galvin in alleged bribery, saying that 
he advised Gardner to offer Paisley the inflated condominium price. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement entered in federal court in Alexandria, Gardner pleaded 
guilty to one count of bribery of a public official, one count of conspiracy to 
commit bribery and one count of tax fraud. He faces a maximum penalty of 18 
years and a $750,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing was postponed until July, apparently to allow him to assist the 
government in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Galvin and the Unisys Corp., as well as Paisley, denied that their 
clients were guilty of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denial by Paisley 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Paisley unequivocably rejects the contention that he was bribed by Charles 
Gardner or anyone else while at the Navy," his lawyer, E. Lawrence Barcella 
Jr., said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Paisley had no knowledge that the sale of his condominium was anything 
other than a completely legitimate, arms-length transaction" at fair market 
price. 
</P>
<P>
William Nussbaum, an attorney for Galvin, said, "Any allegation that Mr. Galvin 
bribed a government official or participated in a conspiracy to bribe a 
government official is absolutely false." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Unisys said that the company had been unaware of Gardner's 
criminal activities. The spokesman noted that those activities had begun when 
Gardner worked for Sperry Corp., which was acquired by Burroughs Corp. to form 
Unisys in November, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner was forced by the company early last year to retire as a vice president 
and general manager of its Fire Control and Surveillance Division in Great 
Neck, N. Y. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Disguised' Payoffs 
</P>
<P>
The payoffs were "disguised by a small group of former Sperry employees and 
consultants . . . " spokesman Peter Hynes said. "Gardner's crimes were rooted 
in premerger practices that the new company helped find and eradicate." 
</P>
<P>
All of Gardner's Sperry superiors have left Unisys since the merger, and 38 
former Sperry employees have been dismissed or otherwise disciplined, Hynes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his admission that he had bribed Paisley, Gardner admitted 
Thursday that he used company money to establish a slush fund for campaign 
contributions to Rep. Roy Dyson (D-Md.), former Rep. Bill Chappell Jr. (D-Fla.) 
and others with influence over the defense procurement process. 
</P>
<P>
His admission, in which he said he had directed Unisys subordinates and defense 
consultants hired by the firm to make the contributions, confirmed an account 
contained in a guilty plea entered in January by former Unisys executive Robert 
D. Barrett and former consultant Joseph E. Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Abbe Lowell, a lawyer who represents both Dyson and Chappell, reiterated that 
the congressmen did not know the money was tainted. The two, and other 
congressmen reported to have received illegal campaign funds, have pledged to 
return them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faces Up to 15 Years 
</P>
<P>
Neal, 63, who said he paid Paisley $149,000 for a condominium that was worth 
only $100,000, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bribery, one 
count of conspiracy to defraud the government and one count of tax evasion. He 
faces a maximum penalty of 15 years and a $750,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Also pleading guilty was Galvin's stepson, Kenneth F. Brooke, 40, who had 
worked for Galvin as an accountant. Brooke promised to testify against his 
stepfather and pleaded guilty to a single count of tax evasion. He faces a 
maximum penalty of five years and a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
The pleas indicated that Gardner, while presiding over Unisys' Great Neck 
division, supervised a network of associates that paid off Pentagon officials 
and contributed illegally to congressional campaigns in an effort to obtain 
further Defense Department business for Unisys. 
</P>
<P>
The net effect, Gardner admitted in the court documents, was that many of 
Pentagon contracts at his division "were obtained or maintained through the use 
of bribes and illegal campaign contributions." 
</P>
<P>
According to an account that both Gardner and Neal swore to be true Thursday, 
the two bribed Paisley in August, 1986, with the condo purchase and sold the 
unit the next year for only $100,000. From 1981 to 1987, Paisley oversaw 
contracts awards for the Navy as assistant secretary. 
</P>
<P>
In return, they said they sought Paisley's help in steering to Unisys 
multibillion-dollar contracts as the Navy's second source for production of the 
Aegis shipboard defense system and a multimillion-dollar contract to produce 
the Marine Air Traffic Control and Landing System. 
</P>
<P>
Both contracts ultimately were awarded to Unisys. The Times reported last 
summer that Paisley in June, 1986, abruptly revised the bidding rules for the 
Aegis contract in a way that favored Unisys. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's admissions disclosed that Gardner and Neal took elaborate 
precautions to disguise the source of the payment to Paisley, which they said 
they made at the recommendation of Galvin, whose close ties to Paisley were 
well-known in the defense community. 
</P>
<P>
Under instructions from Gardner, the documents show, Neal deposited more than 
$150,000 in Unisys money into an account on Britain's Isle of Man, which has 
secretive banking laws. 
</P>
<P>
He then transferred those funds to his own Bahamian-based company, Surrey 
Investments, and finally passed that money through a third firm, Pathway 
Investments, to buy the Idaho condominium. 
</P>
<P>
Neal said he had bribed the other Pentagon official, former Naval Electronics 
Systems engineer Tomlin, after Tomlin told Gardner that he would use his 
influence to help Gardner's company obtain an unspecified multimillion-dollar 
Navy contract in return for a $500,000 payment. 
</P>
<P>
Neal said that, at Gardner's direction, he had transferred 18 separate payments 
totaling $400,000 to Longwood International, a Bahamian company owned by 
Tomlin. It could not be learned to whom the contract ultimately was awarded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resigned From Navy 
</P>
<P>
A Navy spokesman said that Tomlin, a top-ranking civil servant, resigned from 
the Navy in October, 1985. Neither Tomlin nor his attorney could be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner also profited enormously from the transfer of the Unisys funds. 
According to the pleas, a total of $1.7 million paid to Neal under his 
consulting contracts with Unisys ultimately was transferred to AVC Associates, 
a company Gardner had established without the knowledge of his superiors. 
</P>
<P>
The Unisys spokesman said the company planned to take legal action against 
Gardner to recover the funds.

HIGH-TECH METHODS; 
</P>
<P>
HE STARS AS PROTECTOR OF CELEBRITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In December, 1942, 27-year-old Frank Sinatra stood on stage at New York's 
Paramount Theater, embraced his microphone, fixed his blue eyes on the 
bobby-soxers in the front row and crooned, sending his audience of teen-age 
girls into a shrieking, hair-tearing swoon. 
</P>
<P>
That was the birth of a superstar. 
</P>
<P>
And as Gavin de Becker sees it, it was the advent of the age of celebrities as 
targets. Targets of lovesick men and women. Targets of fans with benign, mildly 
amusing delusions. Targets of crazed people intent on stalking and killing 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
At 34, de Becker is himself a star in the field of celebrity protection, relied 
on by many of Hollywood's biggest names and other high-visibility figures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Redford Among Clients 
</P>
<P>
His clients past and present include Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Cher, 
Robert Redford, Dolly Parton, Jane Fonda, Joan Rivers, Victoria Principal, 
Brooke Shields, Olivia Newton-John, Tina Turner and John Travolta. 
</P>
<P>
But de Becker is not a bodyguard, nor does he simply provide that service. He 
does not wish to be even remotely identified with that trade, which he 
dismisses as work for rent-a-hulks and overweight, one-time rock 'n' roll 
roadies. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, de Becker and his staff of 31 offer a unique refinement in the 
celebrity security business, using state-of-the-art computers and psychological 
profiling to help protect clients, some of whom pay as much as $475,000 a year 
for the peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glimpse Into Minds 
</P>
<P>
His special approach also has allowed de Becker to obtain a rare glimpse into 
the troubled minds of the sometimes harmless but often twisted individuals who 
focus attention on themselves by sending "inappropriate" messages to his 
celebrity clients. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the Secret Service and the Capitol Police, who guard members of 
Congress, Gavin de Becker Inc. of Los Angeles has the "best-kept centralized 
files of threatening communications in the country," said Dr. Park Dietz of 
Newport Beach, prosecution psychiatrist at the trial of John Hinckley, 
President Reagan's would-be assassin. 
</P>
<P>
De Becker's business "is a counterpart of what we do in the FBI," to protect 
government figures, said agent Robert Ressler of the Behavioral Sciences Unit 
of the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va. "Unfortunately, we do not live in safe 
times. His type of business really fills a void. The government cannot protect 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
And former Los Angeles County Sheriff Peter Pitchess said: "Gavin is one of the 
best. . . . He has been very, very helpful to us (and) I have recommended him 
to many people." 
</P>
<P>
De Becker will discuss cases but won't name names; a partial list of his 
100-plus clients, most of whom live in California but some of whom are in New 
York, Washington and Nashville, the country music capital, was gleaned from 
other sources. 
</P>
<P>
"Sinatra and Sylvester Stallone are not clients," he said, adding that almost 
every other top Hollywood star is. 
</P>
<P>
To many, celebrities are magnets, and the crazed, some of whom have come to 
California from as far away as Saudi Arabia believing that they have been 
directed by a deity, have been undeterred by barbed wire or attack dogs. Some 
have taken telephone company jobs to gain access to unlisted numbers. They see 
special signs and signals for themselves in such everyday objects as license 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
They have mailed de Becker's clients a dead coyote, dead fish, blood, hair, 
teeth, human and animal fecal matter and bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, though, they begin acting out fixations -- some directed at 
Hollywood stars, others aimed at well-known corporate CEOs -- by writing 
astonishing letters, in which they display obsessive love, hate or other 
threatening desires. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Targeted an Executive 
</P>
<P>
There was a consumer, for example, who targeted a corporate executive, 
convinced that the company's toothpaste had caused his voice to change. There 
was a woman who turned to a toll-free 800 number to seek revenge at the 
corporate board level, blaming a cake mix as culprit: She had put her cake in 
the oven and her child's hair fell out. 
</P>
<P>
De Becker's printouts show that his firm has profiled 5,400 people, all but 
about 1,000 of them in still-active cases; the firm in its research has 
compiled 200,000 pieces of communication, a library of sorts that experts such 
as Dietz, a forensic psychiatrist and professor-on-leave of law and psychiatry 
at University of Virginia, have begun to study. 
</P>
<P>
The threats are sorted by de Becker into three categories: R-1s are fans whose 
craziness poses no danger to a celebrity, for example, the man who insisted 
that a star inform a network television audience of his kidnaping by Martians; 
R-2s are individuals considered a serious threat and who require monitoring; 
R-3s, roughly 40% of de Becker's current cases, are individuals who have 
threatened and are seeking an encounter with a celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 25% of the R-3s actually showed up, though the number of celebrity 
attacks that succeed are "quite low," de Becker said. "But the incidence of 
near-attacks and severe safety hazards is much higher" than ever, he added, 
noting that at any given time, a major media figure "might have 50 or 60 
(threats) that are very bad. It's just astounding." 
</P>
<P>
And though the media widely publicize incidents involving threats and attacks 
against celebrities, corporate VIPs and other high-visibility people, 
psychiatrist Dietz noted that "the press never learns about the vast majority" 
of threats against the prominent. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a recently reported blitz of threatening letters to actor Michael 
J. Fox (a de Becker client) by a female fan upset by the actor's recent 
marriage was "perfectly normal" abnormal behavior, Dietz said. "There are 
thousands of people right now in Los Angeles writing those letters." 
</P>
<P>
Why are modern fans so maniacal? De Becker theorized that the frenzy 
accompanying Sinatra's rise became socially acceptable behavior and "our 
relationship to well-known people changed forever. If, in 1850, someone had 
stood up in an audience and screamed at the top of their lungs and pulled out 
their hair, they'd have gone off to an asylum." 
</P>
<P>
The magic of modern sound systems has created more problems, he noted, by 
making it possible for performers to communicate with audiences in so 
"intimate" a way that even fans in the third balcony believe that the message 
is just for them. 
</P>
<P>
"Idolatry in America is normal," but "what's a mild drug for most people is a 
poison for some people," de Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Obsessive Interest 
</P>
<P>
He argued that the '80s are a time in which there has been an "explosion in 
degrees of famousness," with celebrities subject to obsessive interest by fans 
and the media. "There's bound to be someone out there who thinks you're 
representing the devil" or who is convinced "that little wink you gave before 
you left the stage was for him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the globally ubiquitous presence of television gives fans "a presumed 
intimacy" with their idols, and the medium gives schizophrenics "an excuse to 
be all alone," to fantasize about what they will do with or to a chosen 
celebrity, he said. TV airs a drama about a person who gets blown up while 
turning on the lights; a client soon receives a similar threat. 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrist Dietz put it this way: "It's one thing to sit in a theater with a 
couple of hundred people and watch Bogie. It's quite another to have him in 
one's bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
Dietz is directing a three-year U.S. Justice Department study on violence 
against public figures; de Becker is consulting. Dietz has studied 500 crank 
letters, half from de Becker's files, and found that the writers sent to 
targets, in order of frequency: a photo of themselves, poetry and photos of 
other people or objects, among them a dog and a deodorant ad. 
</P>
<P>
Those who target public figures most often fancy themselves celebrity 
spouses-to-be; others believe that they are a celebrity's child. Though 2% in 
his study had money motives, the thing most craved was contact with the 
celebrity -- a personal reply, at the very least, marriage, at the very most 
(15%). Dietz said he has found "more cases of erotomania (an obsession with a 
non-existent love relationship) in Gavin's files than have been reported in the 
entire world psychiatric literature." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Mark J. Mills, a forensic psychiatrist who is president of Forensic 
Sciences Medical Group in Santa Monica and a professor of psychiatry at UCLA, 
said that to his knowledge the data compiled by Dietz with de Becker "has not 
been replicated." Corroborative research is needed to be "absolutely certain" 
about the conclusions, he said, but he considers de Becker's observations 
"intuitive." 
</P>
<P>
Mills said he believes that one reason for the escalating number of celebrity 
harassment cases is simply that, "like child sexual abuse issues," more are 
being reported. But he agreed with de Becker that television is a major factor: 
"People have the fantasy they really know a celebrity if they see him or her 
regularly on TV." 
</P>
<P>
He said he sees harassment of celebrities as "a peculiarly American issue. We 
are a nation that gives rise to and authenticates virtually unlimited 
expectations. . . . We are taught to feel if we work hard enough we can do 
anything and be anything. And very few people want to be ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, some people will "do anything to be recognized. It's part 
of the American myth that anybody can be unique and remarkable and important." 
</P>
<P>
People who threaten celebrities represent "a wide range of both personality 
disorders and mental disorders," he said. "You're going to see some people who 
are crazy, like Lynette (Squeaky) Fromm (the woman who tried to assassinate 
President Ford), and some people who are merely grandiose or narcissistic or 
troubled." 
</P>
<P>
In his experience, de Becker said, the kinds of productions celebrities star in 
can play a role in the type of threats they receive, with science fiction shows 
"very attractive to crazy people at the age of greatest dangerousness, 28 to 
32." 
</P>
<P>
A male sci-fi film viewer contacted a female celebrity with urgent news: "He 
and my client were the only people in the world who had a particular blood type 
that would allow them to mate and save the world," de Becker said. The man was 
"very dedicated" to getting to the star and was convinced that they were being 
kept apart by Vulcans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Violence Attracts Violent People 
</P>
<P>
Violent people are also attracted to actors who portray violent people, said 
Dietz, who noted that Hinckley did not see "Taxi Driver" 16 times because he 
was a pacifist; he was thinking about assassinations before he ever saw it. 
"But it did him no good to keep watching it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some material de Becker sees is the stuff of probably harmless flights of fancy 
-- "I'm sorry I cannot accept an offer to appear in a film with you." Then, he 
said, there is "the person who is setting the table every night with a place 
for my client. Those aren't so funny." He also encounters many cases of 
erotomania. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, it is mental disorder, not criminal intent, that motivates the vast 
majority of those who pen the sick mail. And though they may be mentally ill, 
they are not fools, de Becker said: "The people we have under assessment are 
smarter than the general population. At least these people write letters." 
</P>
<P>
After receiving the crank correspondence from clients, de Becker and his staff 
tap into their computer bank to identify and locate the source and learn if, or 
when, those troubled individuals might visit Los Angeles. If they do, agents 
frequently are able to monitor their every move. 
</P>
<P>
Offenders usually help on that score. "Most people write (using) their real 
names," said de Becker, who considers the author profile an essential step in 
evaluating his threat. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a criminal history? A history of mental illness? If the writer is 
under psychiatric care, a psychiatrist is notified. If the writer is in a 
mental hospital, the institution might be advised to detain him. 
</P>
<P>
Because of quirks in the law, many of those who send crank correspondence may 
not have violated any statutes and do not fall under law enforcement 
jurisdiction. One of de Becker's tasks is to differentiate between intimidation 
and threats. 
</P>
<P>
Intimidation, he said, is a scare tactic, "the man who says he is Jesus and 
will cause Mt. St. Helens to erupt again," if a chosen star does not act as 
demanded. "My favorite kind of threat -- we know he can't deliver," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'm Going to Kill You' 
</P>
<P>
A real threat, he explained, is unconditional: "Get your affairs in order. I'm 
going to kill you on Thursday. Those we get. Those are real." 
</P>
<P>
Though Dietz disagrees based on his work, de Becker's figures show women are 
less apt to be violent -- perhaps only 10% of his offenders have been female. 
"They don't show up at the residence," de Becker said, "or climb the gate at 2 
in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Twisted fans bent on having star encounters do employ all manner of sneaky 
means. Consider the man who, convinced that a celebrity had injected chemicals 
into his brain to control him, sought a job with that star under an assumed 
name; de Becker thwarted that plan. 
</P>
<P>
Violent fans get themselves hired as security guards for their stars' concerts. 
If detected, they will be monitored or reassigned to low-risk areas of arenas. 
If a suspect simply has bought a concert ticket, "We often occupy the seats 
next to him," de Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
He and his agents are not above their own deceptions. "We have been the limo 
service that meets (suspects) at the airport" in Los Angeles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If intervention is indicated, timing is all-important, de Becker said, adding 
that he believes in acting only when "the fuse is lit." That might mean letting 
a person come to Los Angeles, then "following him to the gun store." 
</P>
<P>
Left alone, de Becker has found, "most of them won't act. You screw around with 
them and then they act." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guns Not Always Necessary 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, de Becker said, his agents are armed, sometimes not. "Firearms are 
not as relevant to protective work as people think they are" in an 
American-style attack, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, his firm made about 60 citizen's arrests, most for violation of 
probation or of a restraining order, or for trespassing. All of those arrested, 
he said, were "mentally ill people." It is rare for him to file a police report 
on routine threats, he said, because "we know there's nothing they can do about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"Even on a death threat," he said, "the restrictions under law are amazing." 
Prosecuting the Michael J. Fox case, the district attorney's office relied on a 
section of the penal code dealing with terrorist threats, de Becker said, 
adding: "That's what it ultimately is, it's terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
His interest in protecting public figures dates to President John F. Kennedy's 
1963 assassination, which he said "was the first world event that had any 
impact on me personally." As a teen-ager, de Becker was a "gopher" for comedian 
Stan Freberg, who worked to get the Kennedy investigation reopened. "I devoured 
all that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not long after graduating from Beverly Hills High, de Becker was recommended by 
Dean Martin's then-wife, Jeannie, whose daughter was a friend, for a job 
helping to protect Taylor and Burton as they trotted around the globe. At 19, 
that was a job "I was in no way qualified" for, de Becker conceded, but he 
added, "I had moxie, and some ability." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, business has burgeoned. He has consulted on the Tylenol poisonings 
investigation and with Domino's Pizza, allegedly targeted recently by Kenneth 
Noid, 22. Police said Noid, irked by Domino's "Avoid the Noid" commercials, 
held two Domino's employees hostage at a Georgia outlet for five hours, then 
ordered and ate a pizza before surrendering. 
</P>
<P>
To de Becker, the rise in disturbed fans has meant increasing revenues. 
Top-of-the-line clients pay $475,000 a year for his services, which in addition 
to threat analysis pays for around-the-clock protection with trimmings, 
including an armored car and escorts for tours. "A very common figure is 
$225,000," he said. "That gets you 24-hour coverage." 
</P>
<P>
Every 60 days, clients on retainer also receive advisories with dates and sites 
they should be concerned about. And though de Becker -- an articulate, 
soft-spoken, coat-and-tie man -- conceded that he "wouldn't last 10 minutes 
with fame," one of his client services is to "raise their tolerance" to living 
with threats. His message: "You don't have to change your life when you get a 
dead chicken" in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the dangers, de Becker understands why celebrities -- some of whom 
receive as many as 4,000 letters a month, a share of those harassing or 
threatening -- do not trade fame for tranquility. He said simply: "They've got 
a cultural ethic built into them," a gnawing need to be "the biggest star."

MYSTERIOUS TARGET OF FRAUD PROBE SHOT DEAD AT ESTATE 
</P>

A former California Highway Patrol officer, under investigation for tax fraud 
in connection with four Los Angeles nude and topless bars, was killed in a hail 
of gunfire early Thursday as he arrived at the gate of his remote Orange County 
home in his chauffeured limousine. 
</P>
<P>
Horace Joseph McKenna, 46, was killed only hours after Los Angeles Superior 
Court records were made public detailing the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's investigation of him and a suspected business partner, Michael 
Woods, also a former CHP officer. The documents identified several people 
associated with both men. 
</P>
<P>
"Judge J.D. Smith released (the court records) yesterday. The thing goes down 
today. You can draw your own inferences," district attorney's spokesman Andy 
Reynolds said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna, a body builder whose sprawling Brea estate reportedly was sometimes 
guarded by men with machine guns, died instantly in the gangland-style ambush 
at 12:30 a.m., Brea police said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting broke out as McKenna's chauffeur, Bob Berg, 42, was returning to 
the car after unlocking the gated entrance to the estate, known as "Tara 
Ranch," in the 6200 block of Carbon Canyon Road, police and employees at the 
ranch said. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna, a hulking 300-pound man who had been asleep in the car, died of 
numerous gunshot wounds, possibly from automatic or semi-automatic weapons, 
police said. The motive was unknown and no suspects were in custody. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear, according to police accounts, how Berg escaped the gunfire. 
Unhurt, he drove the limo to the house, a mile and a half up a winding 
driveway, immediately after the shooting and notified authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Reached by phone Thursday night, Berg, his voice trembling, said he would have 
no comment "until I talk to a lawyer. I don't want to talk about it, I've had 
enough." Berg was identified in court documents as one of the alleged 
conspirators in the tax case. 
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office released 
investigators' search warrant affidavits that had been unsealed in court 
Wednesday at the request of McKenna's attorney, Michael Nasatirs. The 300-page 
document named several associates of Woods and McKenna, including at least 
eight who allegedly conspired with them to hide profits and skim money. 
</P>
<P>
The warrants identified McKenna and Woods as the alleged hidden owners of 
several nude and topless bars in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Several law enforcement agencies -- including Los Angeles and Long Beach 
police, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and the FBI -- had monitored 
McKenna and Woods' suspected hidden interests in the bars, as well as alleged 
illegal gambling, narcotics and prostitution activities, according to the 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said in the warrants that the two men "have maintained 
associations with terminated, retired and currently employed law enforcement 
officers, thus making this investigation extremely sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities had no comment on the whereabouts of Woods Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extravagant Life Style 
</P>
<P>
"McKenna appears to live a life style," investigators wrote, "which apparently 
exceeds his reported income." For example, when McKenna and a girlfriend rented 
an apartment in El Segundo in 1987, they noted, McKenna listed his annual gross 
income as $44,431. 
</P>
<P>
The Brea property, purchased in February, 1986, cost $825,000 and investigators 
estimated mortgage payments to be $70,000 per year. In addition, they said, 
McKenna employed groundskeepers to maintain the horse training track at his 
"Gone With the Wind Arabian Horse Stables," a western movie set, grounds and 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
"Both estimated monthly payments and employment costs well exceeds McKenna's 
reported income of $44,431 . . . and strongly suggests that the McKennas were 
involved in a fraudulent loan application scheme or received funds from 
unreported income," investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry McKenna, McKenna's former wife, has no other source of income, they 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County authorities said Thursday that they were close to filing 
charges against Horace McKenna, who records showed had a criminal history -- 
including a federal conviction for conspiracy to counterfeit in 1976, a Los 
Angeles conviction for assault with a weapon in a San Pedro Bar in 1982, and a 
record of arrests for running what was described as a large prostitution ring 
in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
A native of New Orleans, McKenna joined the CHP in June, 1968, working 
generally in West Los Angeles until he resigned in June, 1972, a CHP spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On April 14, 1976, McKenna surrendered to sheriff's deputies investigating what 
they said was a prostitution ring centered in the Inglewood and Lennox areas. 
McKenna, deputies said, was the suspected kingpin of the ring. 
</P>
<P>
They linked McKenna and the prostitution operation to establishments called 
"The Institute of Oral Love," "Sexual Relief Center" and "Wild Mary's." The 
outcome of that case was not known Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna was sentenced to six years in prison in the counterfeiting case, but it 
was not known Thursday how much time he served. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, at the New Jet Strip in Lennox -- one of the bars in which 
McKenna allegedly was a secret owner -- a woman bartender remarked: 
</P>
<P>
"What a weird night to be working. I didn't think we would be working tonight." 
</P>
<P>
She elaborated: "Because the owner was killed last night. He was all over the 
news." 
</P>
<P>
When asked for more information about McKenna, the woman declined and refused 
to give her name. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't talk about it," she said. "I'm too upset." 
</P>
<P>
At 6-foot-5, McKenna was known as "Mac or Big Mac or just Big," said 
associates, who described him as a flamboyant and mysterious character who kept 
exotic animals on his ranch, where he also often entertained nightclub dancers. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sherry McKenna's attorney, Richard Debro, she feared for her life 
because her former husband had threatened to kill her. He said his client has 
been in hiding. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney said McKenna "used drugs and became incredibly violent." 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen her after she had been beaten up (by McKenna), the black eyes, 
things like that," Debro said. "The law didn't mean anything to him. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she had no doubt in her mind that he would kill her, or have her 
killed" if she insisted on fighting their divorce settlement, the attorney 
said. "He had threatened to kill her with a gun to her head." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Bill Gray, 42, owner of a gym in Brea where McKenna worked out, nor 
other friends and associates contacted Thursday had any idea who would have 
wanted to kill him. They described McKenna as a big, lovable man who was 
building a Shangri-La on his ranch for the pleasure of friends and their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't a mean bone in his body," Gray said. "He would take people's kids 
up (to the ranch) and give them horseback rides." 
</P>
<P>
Since buying the property, McKenna had stocked the ranch with prize Arabian 
show horses -- some worth as much as $20,000, friends said. He remodeled the 
property's sprawling, ranch-style home, installed a swimming pool and rose 
garden and was in the process of completing an Old West-style "ghost town," 
complete with "Main Street" and facades of a saloon, blacksmith shop and bank, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tutty, 31, a longtime friend of McKenna and a member at the 4 Star Gym in 
El Segundo, which KcKenna owned, described him as "a very intimidating person. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
"He was a person who commanded attention. He wanted people to know who he was. 
He had a big ego and he needed fodder for that ego. And he pretty much got it." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tutty said, "he liked the ladies, there's no doubt about it. He was 
very gracious to the ladies." 
</P>
<P>
According to Dana Sermas, one of several woman horse trainers McKenna employed, 
he often entertained friends and business associates by taking them on 
horseback rides and giving them "guided tours of his 'ghost town.' " 
</P>
<P>
McKenna also regularly entertained a group of young women whom he laughingly 
referred to as "his bimbos," because they worked as dancers at nightclubs in 
the Los Angeles area, according to Sermas and Ingrid Locken, another horse 
trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Both women said they were under the impression that the clubs featured topless 
or nude dancing, and they added that the women whom McKenna brought to the 
ranch "dressed in sleazy outfits." 
</P>
<P>
Pete Cahill, 35, another member of the El Segundo gym, described McKenna as 
"the most lovable gangster in the world. If he was a gangster, I guess that's 
the way you've got to go." 
</P>
<P>
Cahill said that at the club it was understood that McKenna "owned a lot of 
topless places. It was an unspoken thing everybody knew but nobody talked about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Sermas said McKenna was in the process of installing an electronic gate at his 
home so the chauffeur would not have to get out of the limousine every time 
they entered. She said the gate was about to be hooked up by utility crews. 
</P>
<P>
While police tried to piece together details of the slaying, one neighbor said 
she thought nothing when three visitors came to McKenna's home on Wednesday 
night, although now it seems ominous. 
</P>
<P>
About 6:55 p.m., the neighbor said, she watched three people, one with a 
flashlight, "going over the fence." 
</P>
<P>
Police would not immediately comment on the woman's statement or other details 
of the case.

A 16-year-old boy, serving time for causing injury by hurling concrete blocks 
from an overpass on Interstate 15 in San Diego, escaped from a Riverside County 
juvenile facility -- allegedly with the help of his mother. Officials at St. 
John's School for Boys in Whitewater said a judge had barred the mother from 
visiting the boy, but a guard who was unaware of the order allowed her into the 
minimum-security facility. The boy was convicted of heaving a 6-pound block 
that smashed the windshield of a car, striking the head of passenger Kurt 
Meyerling, who was comatose for more than two months after the February, 1988, 
incident.

MURDER TRIAL FOR DOG OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of a pit bull terrier that killed a 2-year-old boy while allegedly 
guarding a marijuana patch may be tried for second-degree murder, the 6th 
District state Court of Appeal ruled in San Jose. The three-judge panel said 
that Michael P. Berry, an unemployed construction worker, may also be tried on 
charges of marijuana cultivation and keeping a fighting dog. The boy, James 
Soto, of Morgan Hill, was killed June 13, 1987, when he wandered into a side 
yard of Berry's home where the tethered dog apparently guarded 243 marijuana 
plants.

IRAN 'HIT SQUAD' SUSPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspected Iranian hit squad passed through Spain recently on a mission to 
kill British author Salman Rushdie, the Spanish news agency EFE said. The news 
agency said seven Iranians met in Madrid about 10 days ago and that 
investigations showed they planned to kill Rushdie, whose novel "The Satanic 
Verses" was deemed so blasphemous by Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that he 
ordered the novelist killed. The news agency said that information obtained 
through telephone taps revealed the group was unable to purchase weapons in 
Spain and that no arrests were made for lack of evidence. The report said the 
commando team of five men and two women then split up and left the country. 
Rushdie is in hiding in England.

A student demonstration that had forced the resignation of Republican National 
Committee Chairman Lee Atwater from Howard University's board of trustees ended 
when the university granted the students' demands. The students left the 
administration building around 4 a.m., following several hours of negotiations 
involving the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Washington Mayor Marion Barry and Walter 
Fauntroy, the district's non-voting delegate in Congress. The demonstration 
ended after university officials delivered a letter promising that students 
will not be punished for participating in the action. Atwater resigned Tuesday, 
saying he was worried the occupation might lead to injuries.

A survey of eighth- and 10th-graders shows that a vast majority have tried 
drinking, most don't wear seat belts and about one in three has seriously 
contemplated suicide, researchers reported. The Centers for Disease Control 
reported the results of the National Adolescent Student Health Survey, the 
first such national questionnaire since the 1960s. The 1987 sampling of 11,000 
students in 20 states answered questions about alcohol, drugs, violence, 
suicide and sex, and the results showed unhealthful habits. Thirty-four percent 
of the students -- 25% of the boys and 42% of the girls -- reported that they 
had thought seriously about ending their lives, and 15% had gone so far as to 
attempt potentially fatal injuries. In the eighth grade, 51% said they had 
tried cigarettes and 77% had tried alcohol; by 10th grade, the numbers rose to 
63% for smoking and 89% for booze.

Venezuela restored some civil liberties, including the right to hold public 
protests, that were suspended Feb. 28 to quell nationwide price riots that 
claimed more than 250 lives. Soldiers will continue to patrol main avenues in 
Caracas, the capital, and in other cities until "the situation is totally 
normalized," government information director Pastor Heydra said. Restored 
liberties include press freedom, the right to gather in public and the right to 
travel inside and outside of Venezuela.

France complained to the United States about an incident at Miami International 
Airport involving a French diplomatic pouch that American customs officials 
believe may have contained narcotics, the State Department said. The French 
Foreign Ministry said U.S. customs agents held a French courier for nine hours 
after sniffer dogs and X-rays led them to believe his diplomatic pouch 
contained cocaine. French consular officials came to the airport to identify 
the pouch but refused a request to open it, the State Department said. French 
officials said the pouch was then flown to France for examination by 
anti-narcotics police but that no drugs were found.

Indian police arrested 2,000 people who tried to march on the Madhya Pradesh 
state legislature to protest Union Carbide's $470-million settlement in the 
1984 Bhopal poison gas disaster. About 5,000 demonstrators, many waving banners 
saying "We Want Justice," marched from shantytowns affected by the gas leak 
toward the legislature. The arrests were made as the marchers tried to cross a 
police barricade. Critics charge that $470 million was too small a settlement.

ASHLAND OIL FINED $2.25 MILLION FOR SPILL THAT FOULED TWO RIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge Thursday fined Ashland Oil Inc. a record $2.25 million for a 
1988 oil spill that fouled two rivers in three states and threatened to disrupt 
drinking water supplies for more than 1 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department officials said it was the biggest penalty ever imposed 
against a company for a fuel spill. 
</P>
<P>
"It was something more than simple negligence that the company was guilty of," 
U.S. District Judge Gustave Diamond said. 
</P>
<P>
A dime-sized flaw in the World War II-era steel of a tank at Ashland's Floreffe 
Terminal caused the vessel to collapse on Jan. 2, 1988, and unleash its 
contents of 3.8 million gallons of diesel oil, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 700,000 gallons escaped a dike and entered the Monongahela River 25 
miles south of Pittsburgh, in one of the nation's worst inland oil spills. The 
river is a source of drinking water for suburban Pittsburgh, and is a tributary 
of the Ohio River that is also a source of drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
The tank burst as it was being filled after having been dismantled outside 
Cleveland and reassembled beside the Monongahela. Ashland admitted violating 
industry standards in reconstructing the tank. 
</P>
<P>
Ashland spokesman Roger Schrum called the fine excessive but said the company 
had not decided whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The company had pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor counts under the Clean 
Water and Refuse acts. Each count carried a minimum fine of $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ashland has paid about $18 million in cleanup costs and civil claims from 
residents and businesses affected by the spill. 
</P>
<P>
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined Ashland more than 
$50,000 for safety violations, and the Environmental Protection Agency fined 
the company $145,000 for alleged deficiencies in its spill prevention plan. 
</P>
<P>
About 23,000 suburban Pittsburgh residents endured a week without tap water 
while the river carried the pollution past their water intakes.

U.S. EXPELS SOVIET ATTACHE FOR SEEKING COMPUTER DATA 
</P>

A Soviet military attache, carefully monitored by the FBI for seven months 
while he allegedly tried to obtain sensitive information on U.S. computer 
systems, was ordered expelled from the country Thursday on charges of accepting 
a package of classified documents from a computer company employee. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Dennis Harter said Lt. Col. Yuri Nikolayevich 
Pakhtusov, 35, was declared persona non grata and ordered to return home for 
"activities incompatible with his diplomatic status," the usual charge for 
diplomats caught spying. 
</P>
<P>
According to an FBI spokeswoman, Pakhtusov attempted last August to obtain 
classified information from an employee of a private firm that handles computer 
security programs for the government. The employee immediately contacted the 
FBI and followed the bureau's instructions on future contacts with the Soviet 
official. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Receives Documents 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Wallace, the spokeswoman, said Pakhtusov was arrested Wednesday night 
in suburban northern Virginia after he received classified documents from the 
employee. She declined to name the employee or his company because "if you 
release the identities then these people will not be approached again by the 
Soviets." 
</P>
<P>
She said that Pakhtusov was arrested before he had an opportunity to examine 
the documents. 
</P>
<P>
"The FBI has a policy of talking to business and individuals who may be 
approached by Soviets and other spies," Wallace said. "We request these 
individuals and companies to notify us immediately of any such request. In this 
instance, we were very lucky to have an individual who did his or her patriotic 
duty by informing us immediately about the approaches made by this Soviet 
attache." 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no indication that classified information was compromised, 
the incident underlines a continuing Soviet campaign to penetrate Western 
computer networks and to intercept computer communications. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they (the Soviets) have the technical means that we have to deal 
with encoded material," said Stephen D. Bryen, a former Pentagon technology 
security expert now with Delta Tech Corp. in Washington. "They lack 
supercomputers. From their point of view the only way in is to find a trap door 
that would let them get around the encryption." 
</P>
<P>
Bryen said that Moscow relied for several years on the family spy ring led by 
former U.S. Navy Warrant Officer John A. Walker Jr., who was arrested in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"For a very long while they had free access to our stuff," Bryen said. "Lately, 
they have been running dry, and I am sure there has been a lot of pressure on 
the KGB and GRU to get another source." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Pakhtusov was an officer of the GRU, the Soviet military 
intelligence agency. 
</P>
<P>
An FBI statement said the documents involved in the arrest "dealt with how the 
U.S. government protects classified and other sensitive information contained 
in its computer systems." FBI officials refused to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department official said the department uses a system similar to that 
which Pakhtusov apparently was trying to penetrate. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI said the case had no connection to the arrest last week of several West 
German "hackers" accused of selling computer access codes to Soviet 
intelligence agents. 
</P>
<P>
Pakhtusov is listed as an assistant military attache at the Soviet Embassy in 
Washington, a position that provides him with full diplomatic immunity from 
prosecution. He has been assigned to the embassy in Washington since last June. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all embassies throughout the world employ attaches who act as liaisons 
with the military organizations of the host countries. It is well known that 
the primary activity of many military attaches is the collection of 
intelligence. Because the practice is so widespread, the activities are 
normally overlooked unless they become blatant. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the Soviet Union has expelled American diplomats to retaliate for 
the expulsion of Soviet diplomats. Expulsion is the most severe penalty applied 
to people with diplomatic immunity.

U.S. PROTESTS TO SYRIA OVER ENVOY INCIDENT

<P>
The United States has called on Syria to "close down all activities" of the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command after members of 
the radical Palestinian faction, the main suspect in the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan 
Am Flight 103 over Scotland, last week detained two American diplomats, 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department said that the U.S. Embassy in Damascus is relaying a 
strong protest and an official request to the government of President Hafez 
Assad "to take action against the PFLP-General Command to ensure there is no 
repetition of the incident and to end all the group's activities" in Syria. 
</P>
<P>
A Bush Administration official noted that the sweeping request was prompted not 
only by the incident involving the two embassy staff members but also "on the 
grounds that the PFLP-General Command has long engaged in terrorism and is 
responsible for several well-known past incidents." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Detained for Eight Hours 
</P>
<P>
The envoys, detained for eight hours on March 3, were reportedly military 
attaches posted at the U.S. Embassy. They were picked up near a PFLP-GC refugee 
camp while on what a U.S. source said was a "regular" tour of the area. 
</P>
<P>
"They were only doing what they normally do," the source said. "We suspect that 
(the PFLP-GC) got itchy and nervous about what Americans were doing there and 
suspected that they might be casing the camp for a retaliatory strike" for the 
bombing that killed all 259 aboard Pan Am's New York-bound Flight 103 and 11 
persons in the town of Lockerbie, where most of the plane's debris fell. 
</P>
<P>
The two unidentified Americans, who were unarmed, eventually were turned over 
to Syrian authorities, who returned them to the U.S. Embassy. State Department 
sources said there are, as yet, no plans to recall the two envoys who will 
"continue to carry out their assignments." 
</P>
<P>
The PFLP-GC has been headquartered in Damascus for almost seven years and is 
widely considered to be the largest, most active such group under Syrian 
sponsorship. Its leader, Ahmed Jibril, was born in Syria and is a former Syrian 
army captain, although he is from a Palestinian family. 
</P>
<P>
The PFLP-GC has long been among the most militant Palestinian groups and has 
been associated with a string of terrorist incidents, including an airline 
bombing in the late 1960s. More than a dozen of its operatives, found in 
possession of explosives and detonators, were detained in Germany last October. 
Police suspected that they were planning to blow up a military train. 
</P>
<P>
The renegade faction broke with Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser 
Arafat after the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, charging that he had 
betrayed the Palestinian movement because of his willingness to abandon Lebanon 
under a U.S.-orchestrated plan and because of his subsequent attempt to 
negotiate a diplomatic resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department said that it will continue to hold Assad responsible for 
the safety of American officials accredited to Syria.

EAST-WEST CONVENTIONAL ARMS TALKS START

<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact on Thursday opened 
talks aimed at reducing conventional weapons in Europe and building trust among 
the Continent's nations. 
</P>
<P>
Arms reduction proposals presented by each military bloc at the negotiations 
underlined the differences between the sides, particularly over air and naval 
forces and tactical nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
But the top Soviet negotiator, Oleg A. Grinevsky, said the problems are not 
insurmountable, and he held out hope of an initial agreement by the early 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Chief U.S. negotiator Steven J. Ledogar said the negotiations are off to a good 
start but that NATO does not want to set a time frame for possible agreements. 
"We are not really that far apart," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Sets of Meetings 
</P>
<P>
Two sets of talks are being held in Vienna's majestic Hofburg palace -- one 
between the 16 NATO and seven Warsaw Pact nations on conventional armed forces 
in Europe, the other on building trust among the 35 nations that signed the 
1975 Helsinki accords. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, President Bush heralded the start of the talks, saying: "Today 
marks the beginning of a process of great importance for the people of Europe, 
the United States and Canada and for all who share the hope of a safer and more 
secure Europe." 
</P>
<P>
He said the negotiations on conventional forces "offer a new opportunity to 
redress the imbalance in military forces which strongly favors the Warsaw 
Pact." 
</P>
<P>
On the talks on improving East-West relations, he said: "Our aim is to lift the 
veil of secrecy from certain military activities and forces and thus contribute 
to a more stable Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Although these two negotiations have different participants and aim at 
different kinds of accords, they share a common purpose. That purpose is to 
make Europe safer, to reduce the risk of war and strengthen stability on the 
Continent that has seen more bloodshed in this century than any other part of 
the world," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Outlining the Warsaw Pact's stance on conventional arms, Grinevsky proposed 
deep cuts by 1994 in troop numbers, tanks, artillery and other land weapons and 
combat aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
He gave no numbers but said both blocs should eliminate any imbalances and then 
trim to 10% to 15% below their present lowest levels. 
</P>
<P>
In a second phase, from 1994-97, both sides should trim troop numbers by 25%, 
or about 500,000 military personnel, he said. In a third phase, by the year 
2000, the alliances should move to strictly defensive forces. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, NATO wants specific overall ceilings. Under its proposal, each 
side should be limited to 20,000 tanks, 16,500 artillery pieces and 23,000 
armored personnel carriers. 
</P>
<P>
NATO says the proposal would eliminate the danger of a surprise attack and a 
2-to-1 Warsaw Pact edge in those weapons. 
</P>
<P>
As outlined in a paper given to reporters, the Warsaw Pact proposal at the 
closed-door negotiations made no specific mention of tactical nuclear weapons.

BRITAIN REVIEWS ROLE OF TOUGH NEPALESE FIGHTERS;

FUTURE OF LEGENDARY GURKHAS IN DOUBT

<P>
Can 8,000 Nepalese hillmen reputed to be among the world's best jungle fighters 
find happiness here in the rolling, peaceful English countryside? 
</P>
<P>
If one of history's richest military traditions is to endure, they apparently 
have little choice but to try. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is Britain's 174-year-old military alliance with the famed, 
knife-wielding warriors known as Gurkhas. 
</P>
<P>
The British army's Brigade of Gurkhas -- who take their name from an 
18th-Century Himalayan principality that dominated most of what is now Nepal -- 
is headquartered in Hong Kong. But in 1997, Britain is to turn the colony over 
to China, so the brigade's future is under review. 
</P>
<P>
The government has promised some kind of continuing role for the force and has 
said it will make public its specific plans by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Defense Committee of the House of Commons published a 200-page 
study of the situation in which it expressed "the greatest admiration for the 
achievements of the Gurkhas . . . and for the great friendship and support 
which they have given to the British people." 
</P>
<P>
However, the committee cautioned: "To keep Gurkhas merely for the sake of it -- 
perhaps as a token unit with an artificial role -- would be no more than a 
shabby footnote to past glories. . . . If the only role that Her Majesty's 
government could offer were as a token battalion, performing public duties or 
providing demonstration troops, it might be better to end the historic 
partnership on a high note; with regret, but with dignity." 
</P>
<P>
Here at the headquarters of the 6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles, which 
is the only regiment of the brigade's four currently based in the United 
Kingdom, British officers in charge argued that they see no reason why the 
Gurkhas could not take a place alongside regular British units stationed 
anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adaptability Questioned 
</P>
<P>
The Commons Defense Committee said it expects that "in the long term, the bulk 
of the Brigade of Gurkhas will be stationed in the U.K." 
</P>
<P>
But other analysts question the adaptability of the Gurkhas to the needs of 
modern warfare. 
</P>
<P>
"A low-tech lot in an increasingly high-tech army" is how the Economist, a 
respected news magazine, characterized them not long ago. "Few can read much 
more than rudimentary English," the magazine said. "They are hard to train in 
the use of complicated weapons. They are 'straight-leg' infantrymen in a 
British army that no longer needs their like." 
</P>
<P>
Even an otherwise laudatory, illustrated reference book distributed through the 
Gurkha museum at Church Crookham describes them as "slower to learn than people 
with more formal schooling and more advanced backgrounds than they themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The book, "The Mountain Kingdom: Portraits of Nepal and the Gurkhas," written 
by a longtime British officer of the Gurkha Brigade, goes on to say: "As people 
they are . . . not imaginative nor able always to take the unexpected in their 
stride. Their early life was perhaps too hard, too pressing, primitive, stark 
and demanding to let the mind wander far or for fertile imaginations to 
develop." 
</P>
<P>
If the language of the current discussion sounds as though it might be from 
another era, it is in keeping with the colonial roots of Britain's relationship 
with the Gurkhas. 
</P>
<P>
They met first as enemies when, in the early part of the 19th Century, British 
troops defending the interests of the East India Company clashed with Gurkhas 
trying to extend to the south the influence of their king. After two bloody 
campaigns in which the Gurkhas got the upper hand in the first and the British 
in the second, they made peace. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than risk further trouble with an obviously talented fighting force, Her 
Majesty's government quickly enlisted it, and thousands of Gurkhas have been 
fighting for the Crown ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Gurkhas rallied to the Union Jack for the Afghan Wars and the Boxer Rebellion 
in China; they rode camels into battle with Lawrence of Arabia, and in the 
Falklands they went into battle aboard ships. But their forte is hand-to-hand 
combat, and their battle cry is still "Gurkhali ayo!" -- "The Gurkhas are upon 
you!" 
</P>
<P>
They are known particularly for their skill with the khukri, a curved heavy 
knife that in their Himalayan homeland is used from boyhood as a multipurpose 
tool. On the battlefield it is used mostly to slit enemy throats. 
</P>
<P>
A notch cut in the blade near the hilt is to direct blood away from the handle, 
explained Staff Sgt. Ganga Bahadur Gurung, custodian of the museum. Blood, he 
said, "makes the handle slippery." 
</P>
<P>
Crossed khukris are the Gurkha Brigade's symbol. A Gurkha legend has it that a 
World War II German soldier exulted, "Ja! Missed!" after one of the hillmen 
slashed deftly at him. "Try shaking your head," the Gurkha responds. 
</P>
<P>
"The Almighty created in the Gurkha an ideal infantryman," said Field Marshal 
William Slim, who served with Gurkhas in World War I and commanded them as a 
general in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Bruce M. Niven, who wrote and took the pictures for "The Mountain 
Kingdom," said: "Bold, hardy, tough, enduring and unimaginative, Gurkhas never 
moralize about the ethics of any war or conflict they get caught up in. The 
given order is the rock upon which they will stand until they are overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
Through the years Gurkhas have on 13 occasions won the Victoria Cross, 
Britain's highest award for valor. Their British officers have won 13 more. 
</P>
<P>
Their bravery inspired a story, possibly apocryphal, about a World War II 
Gurkha unit that appeared to disgrace itself when only half its members 
volunteered to join a risky, 1,000-foot airdrop behind enemy lines. Their 
reluctance disappeared, it is said, when it was explained that they would be 
issued parachutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Noble Profession 
</P>
<P>
By some definitions, the Gurkhas are mercenaries. But soldiering is considered 
a noble profession in Nepal, and the label of mercenary is so sensitive there 
that Britain has undertaken in its agreements with the king to discourage its 
use in reference to the Gurkha Brigade. 
</P>
<P>
Following Indian independence in 1947, most of the Gurkhas who were serving 
with the British there transferred to the new Indian army. About 100,000 still 
serve under the Indian flag. Gurkhas also form Nepalese contingents in various 
U.N. peacekeeping forces, and another unit makes up more than 10% of the 
Singapore police force. 
</P>
<P>
The money that the Gurkhas send home to support their families in Nepal, and 
the pensions paid to retired Gurkha soldiers, represents an important source of 
income for one of the poorest countries on earth, where the per capita gross 
national product is the equivalent of $160 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The value to Nepal of the relatively small British Gurkha contingent alone is 
estimated by the Commons Defense Committee at more than $50 million a year -- 
about 2 1/2 times Britain's annual aid to Nepal. The impact on the Nepalese 
economy is one of the factors being considered as the government weighs the 
future size and role of the Gurkha Brigade. 
</P>
<P>
By most measures, the Gurkhas even in peacetime are a bargain for the British 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gordon Corrigan, deputy commander of the 6th Gurkha Rifles, said in an 
interview that the Nepalese soldiers are generally more highly motivated than 
their British equivalents. Absenteeism is almost nonexistent, and about 95% of 
Gurkhas serve for at least 15 years, compared to an average of about five years 
for the typical British soldier. That means a much better return on training 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
A Gurkha rifleman with seven years' service, stationed in the United Kingdom, 
is paid less than $8,900 a year. His British counterpart is paid more than 
$13,000. The difference is even greater for retired soldiers, because of a 
complex salary scheme under which more than 90% of a British Gurkha's pay is 
considered a supplemental allowance. Because the base pay is so low ($77 a 
month for a rifleman), the pension for a Gurkha staff sergeant after 22 years' 
service is only about $800 a year, compared to more than $8,000 for his British 
counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
The 8,000 men of the Gurkha Brigade constitute about 10% of the British 
military's total infantry strength, and with what the army calls a "demographic 
trough" ahead, their relative importance could increase, according to the 
Commons Defense Committee report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tougher Times Ahead 
</P>
<P>
Between now and the year 2000, the report noted, the number of males aged 18 to 
22 in the British population will decrease by about 25%. This is the age group 
from which conscripts are drawn, and with the army having failed to meet its 
recruiting target in six of the past nine years, there is concern that it might 
face even tougher times ahead. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, there are on average about 30 applicants for each of the 
approximately 250 annual openings in the Gurkha Brigade, said Col. Clive N. 
Fraser, liaison officer for the brigade and one of 225 British officers 
attached to it. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiters known as galla walla go into the Nepalese hills twice a year looking 
for stout young men, usually in their late teens. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were to say, 'Anybody who wants to join, come on down!' we would be 
inundated," Fraser said. "There would be thousands." 
</P>
<P>
Many recruits, like Staff Sgt. Ganga at the Gurkha museum, are one of several 
in the family to join up. Ganga's father retired from the Gurkha brigade in 
1969, and he has three brothers in the unit. 
</P>
<P>
Of his life in the army, the 13-year veteran observed: "It's very good 
considering you come from a place high in the mountains, where you don't have 
much educational background and not much opportunity." Tradition and prestige 
are part of the attraction, he said, but "money is the main thing." 
</P>
<P>
Even his minuscule base pay is many times the annual income of 95% of the 
Nepalese, and with the relatively generous "Gurkha addition" for service in 
Britain, he can build a secure home for his family's future. 
</P>
<P>
Among the major drawbacks, Ganga, 32, said, is that Britain, unlike Hong Kong, 
is an "unaccompanied" post for Gurkhas -- no wives or other dependents allowed. 
</P>
<P>
"My small son was born after I came to the U.K.," he said. "I still haven't 
seen him, and he's 20 months old." 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest problem is something that even the army cannot do much about, 
according to Ganga. It's the weather. 
</P>
<P>
"Summer is OK," he said, "but in the winter it's dark and cold. The length of 
the days (short) and nights (long) is the main thing."

'POPE'S BANKER' TO LOSE JOB IN ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING

<P>
The financially strapped Vatican announced a record budget deficit here 
Thursday and an economic reform that will cost the job of a controversial 
American archbishop who has been known for two decades as "the Pope's banker." 
</P>
<P>
Reporting a projected 1989 budget deficit of $78.2 million, a commission of 
cardinals appealed for "every effort to reduce costs." The 15 cardinals, who 
include John Krol of Philadelphia and John J. O'Connor of New York, meet twice 
a year to oversee modernization of the complex 2,366-member Vatican 
administrative apparatus called the Holy See. 
</P>
<P>
As part of an administrative overhaul outlined by Pope John Paul II last June, 
the Vatican bank, called the Institute for Religious Works, is being 
restructured. 
</P>
<P>
"I will probably move on when it's all set up," Chicago-born Archbishop Paul C. 
Marcinkus, the institute's president, told reporters as the Vatican disclosed a 
long-mulled streamlining of a bank scarred by scandal. 
</P>
<P>
A Milan prosecutor issued warrants in 1987 for the arrest of Marcinkus, who has 
headed the bank for 20 years, and two lay bank officials, accusing them of 
being accessories in the fraudulent bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano, which 
collapsed in 1982. Last year, ruling that Italy had no jurisdiction over 
Vatican affairs, an Italian court annulled the warrant against the 67-year-old 
Marcinkus, himself almost a Vatican institution. 
</P>
<P>
Under the reform announced Thursday, the Vatican bank, which denied wrongdoing 
but paid $250 million to Ambrosiano's creditors in recognition of its moral 
responsibility in the collapse, will get new leadership and closer supervision 
by a watchdog commission of five cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Marcinkus' post as president will be abolished. In the new structure, a 
lower-ranking cleric will oversee the bank as secretary, aided by a supervisory 
council of five lay financial experts. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the reform, Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Agostino Casaroli 
said Marcinkus will remain at his post to assist with the transition, which is 
expected to take several months. 
</P>
<P>
The personable Marcinkus, an avid golfer and sometime papal bodyguard, will 
remain at the Vatican -- and may move from vice president to president of the 
Vatican city-state, the church's independent 108-acre territory surrounded by 
Rome. 
</P>
<P>
The city's administration is in the black, but the church administration, 
called the Holy See, is drowning in red ink. A 1988 deficit of around $65 
million will grow to $78.2 million for the 1989 fiscal year, the cardinals 
said, anticipating revenues of $56.1 million and expenditures of $134.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
A large part of the increased deficit, the cardinals said, came from inclusion 
in the budget of the $10.1 million cost of maintaining the Vatican's 118 
diplomatic missions aboard. Previously, they had been funded by special monies 
now exhausted, the cardinals said. 
</P>
<P>
To meet its bills, the Vatican has in recent years relied on a yearly 
collection in churches around the world called Peter's Pence, which was 
originally intended as a fund to be at the Pope's disposal. Last year the 
collection grew 5.5% to $52.9 million, the Vatican reported.

WOULD-BE SOVIET EMIGRES SAY 'NOISE WILL GET US OUT'; 
</P>
<P>
DON'T FORGET US, FASTING WOMEN REFUSENIKS PLEAD

<P>
A group of the forgotten -- Soviet Jewish women struggling to emigrate after 
the more famous refuseniks have gone -- are observing a three-day fast to try 
to remind the world that they are still barred from leaving their country. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the women gathered Thursday in the apartment of Ella Varshavsky, a 
graying, soft-spoken Muscovite who served as a personal secretary in the KGB 
during the Stalin Era but left her job 41 years ago and began trying to 
emigrate in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The women, who sipped water out of wine glasses and shared jokes to lift their 
spirits, included several who have waited a dozen years to leave, as well as a 
"new refusenik," as Marina Gorelik describes herself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'To Frighten Others' 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to forget us, but we must not be cast aside. Only noise will get us 
out," said Natasha Stonov, who has been trying to emigrate since 1979. 
"Otherwise the Soviets will simply keep us here, both to frighten others who 
might want to leave and to keep people in the bank to trade with the West at 
some future date." 
</P>
<P>
Gorelik, a 30-year-old linguist, and her husband, a computer programmer, were 
denied exit visas only three weeks ago on the grounds that they had access to 
state secrets. 
</P>
<P>
Gorelik flatly refuted the allegation. "The Soviets simply don't want everyone 
to think they can leave now, so they use state security as an excuse to create 
new refuseniks," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Improving Rights Image 
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 Jews, the largest number since 1980, were allowed to emigrate 
from the Soviet Union last year as part of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
efforts to improve his country's human rights image and allow the Soviets a 
greater role in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Among the well-known recent emigres were longtime Soviet Jewish activist Natan 
Sharansky, Hebrew teacher Josef Begun and Ida Nudel, known as the "mother of 
refuseniks." 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Israel had demanded freedom for Soviet Jews before Moscow 
could be accepted as a potential negotiator in the Middle East. Last month, in 
a sign that the Kremlin's tactics were at least partly successful, Israeli 
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens met with his Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze, in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, emigration restrictions have not yet eased enough for the 46 
women across the Soviet Union who are participating in the fast, which began 
Wednesday on International Women's Day. They say in all there are about 80,000 
refuseniks and that countless others have not even applied, fearing 
repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commission Sought 
</P>
<P>
Women in several cities, including Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev and Minsk, are 
participating in the strike, organizers said. They are calling on the Soviet 
Union to set up a commission to review their cases. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the group were denied permission to emigrate on the grounds that 
they had had access to state secrets, and the other half were refused 
permission to leave because their parents or divorced spouses failed to sign 
official documents stating they have no financial claims on the would-be 
emigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Varshavsky, 74, was initially turned down because of the KGB job she had held 
from 1938 to 1948, when Josef Stalin ruled the Soviet Union. She is reluctant 
to talk much about her work, saying only that she is ashamed of it and left 
when she was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, the Soviets said I possessed secrets. Now they know that is 
ridiculous and simply say it is 'undesirable' for me to go," said Varshavsky, 
who is seeking to join her son in Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
"The years of Stalin were a nightmare, and I still suffer bouts of depression 
from my work at the KGB," she said, her eyes filling with tears. "I have begged 
the authorities, at least, not to deprive me of motherhood in my old age." 
</P>
<P>
Varshavsky said the group meeting in her apartment was heartened by receiving 
calls of support from the United States, London, France, Canada and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets are trying very hard to create the impression that everyone who 
wants to leave is out now," said Stonov. "We can only hope these calls mean 
they are not succeeding."

KANSAN FOLLOWS A DISTANT DRUMMER WITH 'NO' VOTE 
</P>

When Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.) cast the lone GOP vote Thursday 
against John Tower's nomination to be defense secretary, it was just the latest 
example of an independent streak that has earned her respect in both parties. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the daughter of 1936 Republican presidential nominee Alfred M. 
Landon bucked the Ronald Reagan Administration by voting for economic sanctions 
against South Africa and by helping to lead the Senate in an override of the 
President's veto. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Kassebaum challenged the Reagan Administration's policy of 
seeking a military solution to the Nicaraguan civil war, and she has voiced 
abortion positions that set her apart from most other Senate Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can say she is an automatic, hard-line party vote," one Senate aide 
said. "She has strong conservative views and more often than not votes with her 
party, but she votes her own mind, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Kassebaum, 56, released a four-page statement explaining her 
opposition to Tower, saying: "I have discussed this matter in some detail with 
the President. I believe he understands my thinking just as I understand his." 
</P>
<P>
In prepared comments that the publicity shy Kassebaum did not actually deliver 
on the Senate floor, she charged that Tower's work for defense contractors 
shortly after leaving his position as a U.S. arms-control negotiator "raises 
very serious concerns about the nominee's judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Kassebaum, who formerly headed the Senate's Military Reform Caucus, suggested 
that the Pentagon procurement scandal has shaken public support for defense 
spending and said that Tower's actions, while not illegal, "demonstrate to me 
an enormous insensitivity to issues and questions that have been at the heart 
of our defense debate for years." 
</P>
<P>
The Kansas senator, sensitive to allegations that Tower is a womanizer, also 
questioned whether he would "demonstrate the necessary sensitivity" to women's 
rights issues in the military. She noted a recent Pentagon study indicating 
that women face serious problems with harassment and promotion in the armed 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
Until her statement was released an hour before Thursday's vote, Kassebaum took 
no part in the often vitriolic Senate debate. But she criticized the "circus 
atmosphere" surrounding the nomination, contending that the news media had been 
irresponsible in reporting allegations about Tower that had not been proved.

BUSH MUST MOVE QUICKLY WITH NEW CANDIDATE TO RECOVER, OBSERVERS SAY 
</P>

The bitter fight that culminated in the Senate's rejection of former Republican 
Sen. John Tower as defense secretary Thursday inflicted personal wounds on both 
sides of the aisle and seared George Bush's relations with the 
Democratic-controlled Congress only 48 days into his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
But the question of how profound the impact of the battle will be on the major 
policy decisions President Bush and the Congress must deal with in the months 
ahead appears still to hang in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
Bush can recover quickly from the embarrassing defeat, members of both parties 
agreed Thursday, but only if he moves swiftly to nominate a qualified candidate 
for secretary of defense and establishes a well-focused agenda for his 
Administration as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Terrible Distraction' 
</P>
<P>
"The critical thing is whether he comes right back with a strong appointment 
and puts this to rest or stumbles another week trying to find someone," said a 
key Republican strategist. "This thing has been a terrible distraction and has 
stepped all over the things Bush has wanted to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush has got to set an agenda now, or Congress will set it for him," the GOP 
strategist said. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Democratic Whip Alan Cranston of California, who says that the next 
Pentagon nominee must be "eminently qualified," thinks that Bush squandered the 
opening days of his presidency by getting mired in the Tower controversy and 
"failing to focus on any major matter he wanted to move on swiftly." 
</P>
<P>
And in some key areas, the bruising legacy of the Tower fight is likely to 
haunt Bush for months to come -- notably on defense policy and the on-going 
struggle between the President and Congress over their respective roles in 
governing the nation. In particular, the already powerful chairman of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee, Democrat Sam Nunn of Georgia, is likely to 
become an even more formidable problem for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Opposing Tower was the boldest move of Nunn's usually understated Senate 
career. He came out of the struggle with his image as a "statesman" battered -- 
unfairly, sources close to him say he believes -- but with a new reputation as 
a determined partisan leader. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn almost certainly will play a critical -- and potentially more determined 
-- role in shaping such pending issues as the future direction of U.S. 
strategic weapons, reform of the scandal-plagued Pentagon procurement system 
and the relative power of the President and Congress in setting national 
security policy. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the biggest loser in the Senate action -- other than Tower and 
perhaps Bush -- could turn out to be the man who is perhaps the Democrats' most 
prominent member of Congress: House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas. The Senate 
action means that House Democrats will be under intense pressure to hold Wright 
to high standards when the House Ethics Committee makes its report on an 
investigation into Wright's finances, probably next week. 
</P>
<P>
In the immediate aftermath of Thursday's vote, self-interest was pushing both 
congressional Democrats and the Bush White House in the direction of papering 
over the cleavage. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, mindful that he can do little without cooperation from the overwhelmingly 
Democratic House and Senate, issued a conciliatory statement. Sen. Alan K. 
Simpson (R-Wyo.), a close friend of Bush, said that it is "goofy" for anyone to 
think that bipartisanship would not return to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just been talking with Sam Nunn and (Senate Majority Leader) George 
Mitchell (of Maine) and we're back to business as usual," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A senior White House aide agreed that the Tower loss does not spell doom for 
the rest of Bush's presidency. 
</P>
<P>
"The sun's going to come up tomorrow, George Bush is still going to be 
President, Sam Nunn is still going to be chairman of the Armed Services 
Committee. We're here for years, he's here for years," said one senior White 
House aide. "People aren't going to say, 'I voted against John Tower, that 
means I can now vote more against George Bush on other issues,' it doesn't work 
like that; there's no nexus." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls to Bush 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, many Democrats worried about voters' reaction to the GOP charge that 
they rejected Tower for purely partisan reasons. Nunn and Mitchell telephoned 
Bush after the Senate vote to say they wanted to work with him in "a 
cooperative and constructive fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the former majority leader, sought to 
downplay the Tower fight as "one of those passing storms that's gone by and 
gone out to sea" and said: "We'll have fair weather until the next storm comes 
along." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, GOP National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater said Thursday that "it 
won't be street wisdom, but all the Democrats in the Senate for the next three 
or four weeks will go out of their way to work with the White House in an 
unprecedented manner to prove that this was not the partisan way they want to 
operate. That should make for smooth sailing for other Bush appointments." 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the surface, however, hard feelings may not fade so quickly after such 
a rancorous Senate debate. Republicans in particular indicated they are 
unlikely to soon forget the battering one of their former colleagues took on 
the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
Some Republican senators angrily predicted that it would hurt Bush on the 
international stage. Others said it would weaken him in his relations with 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"What it tells the world," said Sen. Steve Syms (R-Ida.), "is that George Bush, 
who was elected President of the United States, really has to kowtow to a 
Congress with a different ideological viewpoint." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jake Garn (R-Utah) said the Senate action "set a bad precedent for the 
future" and Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) said, "It's going to be hard to pull 
all the pieces back together." 
</P>
<P>
Republicans were especially upset that FBI files quoting anonymous sources on 
drinking and womanizing allegations against Tower were used by the Democrats in 
the Senate debate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressure Over Wright 
</P>
<P>
Democrats as well as Republicans said the Senate's repudiation of Tower along 
basically partisan lines puts Democrats under extraordinary pressure to take 
some action against the House Speaker if the House Committee on Standards of 
Official Conduct finds that he violated ethics rules. 
</P>
<P>
The committee has been investigating complaints that Wright broke House rules 
in a variety of financial dealings. If the panel finds serious violations, it 
could recommend that the full House reprimand, censure or expel Wright. 
</P>
<P>
The House fight in the current atmosphere could turn out to be every bit as 
bitter as the Senate fight over Tower, since the committee investigation was 
instigated by complaints against Wright by angry Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate action, said Cranston, "probably will make the fight over Wright 
even nastier. I imagine some Republicans will be out for blood, having lost in 
the Senate and having had their blood spilled." Several Republican strategists 
said they think Nunn's reputation for statesmanlike qualities had been 
tarnished by his role in the Tower fight. And two days ago Nunn himself 
predicted: "When it's over, I'm going to be bruised. I knew that when I 
started. I understood that . . . I'll be bruised, but I'm not going to have any 
grudges at all, and we'll proceed and try to do the nation's business." 
</P>
<P>
Although Nunn has emerged unscathed from past Senate fights, this time 
Republicans took after him personally, even spreading the story about a 1972 
auto accident that raised questions about whether Nunn, then 26, had been 
driving while drunk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls Nunn Opportunist 
</P>
<P>
The bitter residue of the contest was reflected in comments by Jim Lake, a Bush 
strategist during the presidential campaign. Lake said that it "showed Nunn is 
now a partisan guy who moves when he sees an opportunity and doesn't mind 
sullying a man's reputation. Nunn was always thought to be above that." 
</P>
<P>
But Atwater said that while Nunn's reputation as "almost a statesman" was 
damaged, "if his goal was to show that he could be a strong leader in a 
partisan fight, he succeeded." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell also was cited by several strategists of both parties as one of the 
players who came out on top in a fight that some participants said produced 
only losers, no winners. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's been talking about this being a loser for everyone, that the 
Senate comes out looking bad, the President, certainly John Tower, but I'm not 
so sure that there isn't one winner and that's George Mitchell," said a 
Republican strategist involved in the Tower fight. 
</P>
<P>
"He consolidated his power and showed he's a force to be reckoned with." 
</P>
<P>
Although his was a losing effort, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas, 
who fought bitterly and forcefully on Tower's behalf, shed his reputation as a 
reluctant ally of the President. 
</P>
<P>
Dole strengthened his ties to the President, said Atwater, who quoted Bush as 
saying, "Dole really goes to bat, and I appreciate it."

NEW DEMOCRATIC LEADER WINS HIS FIRST TEST; GEORGIAN DEMONSTRATES HIS INFLUENCE

<P>
For a brief interlude at the beginning of this week, the White House actually 
believed that it could push John Tower through the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
It was on Monday that Sen. Howell Heflin of Alabama became the first Democrat 
to announce his support of the nomination of the former Texas senator to be 
defense secretary. White House vote counters reckoned then that they had 49 of 
the 50 votes they needed: all 45 Senate Republicans plus Democrats Heflin, 
Christopher S. Dodd of Connecticut, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and J. Bennett 
Johnston of Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for that last elusive vote, President Bush met in the Oval Office with 
Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, who had entered the Senate in the same year as 
Tower (1961) and who was thought to be troubled by the rough treatment that his 
former colleague was receiving from his Democratic opponents. To build 
momentum, Republicans arranged for Dodd to announce his support for Tower on 
Tuesday and planned for Bentsen to do the same Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Johnston's Decision 
</P>
<P>
Then, Republican hopes evaporated as suddenly as they had materialized. In a 
private telephone call, Johnston notified Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.) that he was voting against Tower. 
</P>
<P>
So even as Dodd became the second Democrat to break ranks, Mitchell calmly 
announced that Tower would be defeated. In the end, 52 Democrats voted against 
Tower and, with the support of Republican Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, 
they scored a 53-47 victory Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Tower's defeat represented a signal victory, not only for Mitchell in his first 
test as the Senate's new Democratic leader, but especially for Armed Services 
Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.). Nunn, concentrating on Tower's drinking 
habits and his consulting company's acceptance of $750,000 from defense 
contractors since he left the Senate in 1984, led the opposition to Tower both 
in his committee and on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a testimony to Sam Nunn's influence," a senior Bush adviser said. "I 
don't think there's another committee chairman who could have pulled this off, 
because there were a helluva lot of Democrats who weren't all that comfortable 
with where they were." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
White House Miscalculation 
</P>
<P>
The outcome also reflected lack of sufficient White House concern over Tower's 
confirmation, despite early warning signals from Nunn. Only after Nunn's 
committee voted, 11 to 9, against Tower -- at a time when Bush was half-way 
around the world at the funeral of Emperor Hirohito in Japan -- did the 
President swing into action to save his nominee. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Tower wanted to back out and spare Bush further embarrassment. 
He went to the President and offered to withdraw his name, Sen. Pete Wilson 
(R-Calif.) disclosed after Thursday's vote. 
</P>
<P>
"John Tower repeatedly offered the President the opportunity to abandon this 
fight and George Bush refused to do so and it was the right thing to do," 
Wilson said. "It was important not only to vindicate John Tower but let the 
American people know the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Republican senators commonly laid responsibility on Nunn for making Tower the 
ninth Cabinet nominee in history to be defeated in the Senate -- and the first 
of a President's initial round of nominees. 
</P>
<P>
"This was made a personal matter by Sen. Nunn," Wilson said. " . . . A number 
of Democratic colleagues admitted privately (that) they yielded to arm-twisting 
. . . and said that this has become a test of personal allegiance to the 
chairman." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.) added: "When Sen. Nunn came down the other way, 
the others all wheeled into line behind him. Sam Nunn was the key -- he gave 
the others cover." 
</P>
<P>
Democrats likewise credited Nunn, who has built a reputation for a nonpartisan 
approach to defense issues, with holding the fractious party together. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of individuals based their decision on the fact that Sam Nunn took the 
position that he did," said Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.) 
</P>
<P>
Sen. J. James Exon (D-Neb.) said that Majority Leader Mitchell did not 
strong-arm the Democrats into line. "He said: 'I want them to make up their 
owns minds,' " Exon said. " 'I hope they tell me when they do.' " 
</P>
<P>
But, after the Armed Service Committee's strictly party-line vote against 
Tower, Mitchell worked with Nunn to persuade uncommitted Democrats to fall into 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) said that it was only after senators began inspecting 
the FBI report on Tower's history of drinking and womanizing -- a report that 
was carefully guarded in a fourth-floor room in the Capitol accessible only to 
senators -- that a pattern of Democratic opposition began to emerge. "That's 
when things began to gel," Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intensive Fight 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, meanwhile, Bush returned from his Asian trip and plunged 
into an intensive fight to win over a few undecided Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"You can lose a battle like this in the court of public opinion and grass-roots 
lobbying, but you can't win it that way," a senior Bush adviser said. "The 
President has to win it." 
</P>
<P>
Among the senators on the early White House list of likely Democratic prospects 
were Bob Graham of Florida and David L. Boren of Oklahoma. When the Senate 
rejected former President Ronald Reagan's nomination of Robert H. Bork to the 
Supreme Court in 1987, Boren was one of two Democrats who voted for him. 
</P>
<P>
But Boren quickly announced his opposition to Tower, and so did Graham. 
</P>
<P>
By the beginning of this week, the White House was focusing on the handful of 
still-uncommitted Democrats. Those included Pell and two freshmen, Joseph I. 
Lieberman of Connecticut and Charles S. Robb of Virginia, who would be casting 
their first major votes on Tower's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
All three voted against him. The only three Democrats who supported Tower were 
Heflin, who surprised the White House with his announcement Monday; Dodd, who 
noted that Tower had supported his father, also a senator, when the Senate 
censured him in 1967, and Bentsen, Tower's fellow Texan. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the President turned a vote," a senior Bush adviser said. 
"Bentsen and Dodd were going to go for Tower, and Heflin seems to have reached 
an independent judgment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Test of Loyalty' 
</P>
<P>
"It got down to a test of loyalty in the Senate -- George Mitchell and Sam Nunn 
versus George Bush and John Tower, and George Mitchell and Sam Nunn started 
with 55 (Democratic) votes." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who had been Bush's chief rival for 
last year's Republican presidential nomination, became the chief strategist of 
the drive to confirm Tower. He met almost daily with White House Chief of Staff 
John H. Sununu and conferred with him regularly by phone. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, the one Republican who defected was Kassebaum, Dole's fellow 
Kansan. Her vote came as a pleasant surprise to the Democrats, but she had 
given Bush the news two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognized that she's an independent person who doesn't respond well to 
lobbying by anybody, not even Bob Dole," a White House adviser said.

FAA TO GIVE BUSIEST AIR CONTROLLERS BIG RAISES IN BID TO IMPROVE SAFETY

More than 2,000 air traffic controllers and other Federal Aviation 
Administration employees will receive pay raises of up to 20% under a program 
that Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said Thursday is aimed at 
increasing air safety. 
</P>
<P>
The additional pay is to take effect on June 1 at 11 of the FAA's busiest 
facilities -- those that monitor air traffic over the New York, Chicago, Los 
Angeles and Oakland areas. FAA officials say they have had difficulty staffing 
their most complex facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The increases, called "retention allowances," will go to 2,100 controllers, 
inspectors and technicians for a five-year experimental period and may be 
extended to other FAA operations, a Transportation Department news release 
said. The FAA has about 19,000 controllers and other personnel working in air 
safety at more than 460 sites. 
</P>
<P>
"Facilities which have the most complex operations, the most chronic staffing 
difficulties and the most impact on the overall national aviation system are 
included in the demonstration project," Skinner said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the additional pay "will help us achieve our goal of a safer and 
more efficient national aviation system." 
</P>
<P>
A majority of the affected employees are air traffic controllers. Others are 
aviation safety inspectors and technicians who service computers and other 
equipment used to monitor air traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Facilities where the increases will take effect are the Air Route Traffic 
Control Centers in Aurora, Ill., and Ronkonkoma, N. Y.; the Chicago O'Hare and 
Los Angeles international airports; the Oakland and Santa Ana, Calif., and the 
Westbury, N. Y., terminal radar approach control facilities, and the flight 
standards district offices in Los Angeles, Teterboro, N. J., and Farmingdale 
and Valley Stream, N. Y.

WAVES POUND CAROLINA COAST; COTTAGES GONE WITH THE SAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huge waves pounded the beaches along the Outer Banks of North Carolina, 
tumbling cottages into the surf as if they were sand castles, and a winter 
storm dumped freezing rain, sleet and snow Thursday on parts of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
The waves that claimed six cottages or motel buildings along the northern Outer 
Banks also chewed up yards of precious beaches, leaving sheer sand cliffs at 
the ocean's edge. 
</P>
<P>
Kitty Hawk spokesman David Monroe watched as the ocean swallowed a cottage at 9 
a.m., just minutes after high tide bashed oceanfront property for the third 
time since early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cast About on Waves 
</P>
<P>
"The structure was undermined severely by wave action. The pilings collapsed," 
Monroe said. "The structure cast about on the waves like a houseboat. Then it 
battered five adjacent cottage fronts before it was broken apart by the wave 
action. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just piles of debris deposited in several places on the beach right now," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 68 other structures were threatened by anticipated bashings at high 
tides overnight and this morning. 
</P>
<P>
At least 18 people were evacuated from the area, which supports a small 
off-season population. 
</P>
<P>
"The rains are letting up, but it seems like the winds have increased," said 
Wally Piland, a spokesman for the city of Nags Head. "We have constant winds of 
20 to 30 m.p.h. with sudden strong bursts. 
</P>
<P>
"But the seas have not calmed down a bit," he said. "We have 8- to 10-foot 
waves constantly, but just a mile or two off the beach the seas are 18 feet." 
</P>
<P>
Officials worried about more beachfront flooding that could come overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"We're supposed to have an increased tide tonight by as much as one-half foot 
because of the lunar effects," Piland said. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists who have used the pristine beaches would not recognize the area now, 
Monroe said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like someone has just taken a massive bulldozer and driven away with 
all of our sand," he said. "We've lost about 10 lineal feet of frontal dune. We 
have a sheer face on them right now. They just drop right down to nothing. 
We've lost 6 to 8 feet of elevation of sand." 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 26, two motels were damaged by erosion at Nags Head and Kill Devil 
Hills. Kill Devil Hills police Maj. Mike Harris said sandbagging done at those 
facilities last weekend so far has protected the units from further damage. 
</P>
<P>
The storm also pelted the Raleigh-Durham, N.C., area and Duke Power Co. 
spokesman Mike Mullen said about 10,000 of the utility's customers in Durham 
were without electricity Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frozen Power Lines 
</P>
<P>
Mullen said the power outage was caused by frozen power lines and frozen tree 
limbs knocking down power lines. 
</P>
<P>
In Virginia, meanwhile, no significant snow accumulation was reported but many 
roads were icy. 
</P>
<P>
A winter weather advisory was in effect for the southwest and northeast 
Piedmont and southern foothills of Virginia, along with the central and 
southern coastal plain and the sandhills of North Carolina and parts of South 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, a storm in the West brought rain showers to southwestern Oregon.

EDWARD POWERS, 75; EX-AGENT, 'FATHER OF LOTTERIES'

Edward Powers, the FBI agent who helped solve the 1950 $2.2-million Brinks 
armored car robbery and because of his background and reputation was picked to 
manage the first modern American lottery, has died at age 75. 
</P>
<P>
Powers died Tuesday in a hospital here, where he moved in 1978 after retiring 
as director of the New Hampshire lottery. He had undergone bypass surgery in 
1979 and last year. 
</P>
<P>
The "Handbook of U.S. Lottery Fundamentals," a 400-page reference manual, calls 
Powers the "father of U.S. lotteries." 
</P>
<P>
He served as president of several national and international lottery 
organizations. In his retirement, Powers was a consultant to several state 
lotteries and companies that produce lottery paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
Powers, as FBI agent in charge of the Boston office, spent six years trying to 
solve the Brinks case. The break came when one of the holdup men informed on 
the others because he believed he did not get his fair share of the loot. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, after 22 years with the FBI, he was hired to manage the New Hampshire 
lottery because its sponsors wanted to prove it could be run without organized 
crime influence. 
</P>
<P>
As New Hampshire lottery director, Powers, who lived in Bedford, was 
instrumental in lobbying Congress to repeal an excise tax on lottery winnings 
and to allow radio and TV stations to broadcast lottery numbers across state 
lines.

The father of a teen-ager who died unexpectedly earlier in the week, three 
years after receiving the heart of a young admirer, said Thursday that he knows 
now what the donor's family went through. 
</P>
<P>
"When you walk in and see your daughter dead, it hurts bad," said Raymond 
Ashlock on the eve of the funeral of his daughter, Donna. 
</P>
<P>
Donna, who would have been 18 on April 1, was found dead in bed by Ashlock. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a shock," he said. "There were no signs of her being sick." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said that the death apparently occurred as a result of 
irregular beating of the heart, a common complication in heart transplants. 
Donna had experienced some rejection of the heart and was awaiting a second 
transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Ashlock said his daughter would not have lived the last three years without the 
heart she received from high school classmate and admirer, Felipe Garza.

Thai police stormed a jungle hide-out along the Mekong River, 325 miles

battle that left two Laotian kidnapers dead, authorities said Thursday.

The hostage, Yoshiaki Asao, 61, head of the Japanese trading company Mitsui and 
Co. in Laos, was abducted from his house in the Laotian capital of Vientiane 
before dawn March 1 and taken across the border to the hide-out. No ransom 
demands were made and no claims of responsibility were issued for the 
kidnaping, the second abduction of a Mitsui executive in Southeast Asia in the 
past three years.

TWO GANG MEMBERS HAD KEY TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE FROM JAIL, LAPD SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two gang members who still are missing used a key to escape from the jail at 
the 77th Street Division during the weekend, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The fugitives, Buford Bates, 24, and Eric Wright, 18, are members of the 
Rolling 60s Crips gang and had been arrested on suspicion of kidnaping and 
robbery, Police Cmdr. Bill Booth said. They had been taken into custody during 
a crackdown on drug trafficking in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Our investigation has established that they escaped (with) . . . a key," Booth 
said. "We're not certain how. . . . We start with the strong assumption of 
negligence or poor procedure someplace." 
</P>
<P>
However, Booth did not rule out the possibility that someone inside the police 
station may have given the prisoners a key that fits cell doors and a back 
door. The key was later found outside the building, Booth said, but he declined 
to say where. 
</P>
<P>
Bates and Wright were among 33 suspects arrested last week during joint raids 
by the FBI, anti-gang police detectives and agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms. Police said they are suspected of stealing 11 guns, 
including a MAC-11 assault weapon, from a man they allegedly kidnaped on Jan. 
30.

WITNESS SEIZED IN ALLEGED TRIAL SABOTAGE PLOT 
</P>

A Canadian nanny whose testimony helped convict the adopted son of a 
millionaire tobacco executive on a sex charge involving a 3-year-old girl has 
been arrested as she allegedly tried to collect $200,000 not to show up at a 
retrial, the FBI said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Isabel Anderson, who testified that she saw Luis Gillespie raping the child in 
his adoptive father's Hancock Park mansion in June, 1985, was taken into 
custody in Seattle on Wednesday as she collected the money from someone she 
thought was sent by a defense attorney, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified person was an FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, there will be no retrial. The U.S. attorney's office, seeing 
its primary witness against Gillespie apparently discredited, filed for 
dismissal of the charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have made a retrial extremely difficult," Assistant U.S. Atty. Julie 
Blackshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested with Anderson, the FBI said, was Vancouver, Canada, resident Kelley 
Peter Wiebe, 29, who was accused of being Anderson's lookout for the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie was convicted in Los Angeles federal court in 1987 of transporting 
his godchild from his native Ecuador for immoral purposes. He was sentenced to 
10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, however, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal reversed the 
conviction, ruling that U.S. District Judge David Kenyon erred by allowing 
prejudicial and irrelevant testimony that the defendant and his adoptive 
father, David Gillespie, had a homosexual relationship. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court ordered a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, however, Gillespie served two years in prison, because he was 
not allowed to remain free on bail pending appeal. 
</P>
<P>
According to the joint announcement by Steven L. Pomerantz and Lawrence G. 
Lawler, special agents in charge of the Seattle and Los Angeles FBI offices, 
respectively, Anderson initially demanded $500,000 not to testify at a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI would say only that she made her offer to a "defense attorney" and that 
the amount "was later reduced" to $200,000. It was not made clear whether the 
lower amount was her suggestion or that of the agent. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's current attorney, Robert Perry, was not available to discuss the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
At the time Anderson and her companion were arrested, the FBI said, Wiebe was 
carrying "a large bag to accommodate the monies." Like Anderson, he was 
reportedly a Canadian citizen. He was charged with conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Both were taken before a U.S. magistrate in Seattle and held pending further 
hearings.

Beverly Hills High School -- a 60-year-old landmark frequently portrayed in 
television and movies as California's typical high school campus -- would be 
torn down and replaced by a Century City-style high-rise development under a 
new proposal to raise money for one of the nation's most affluent school 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to redevelop the high school site is one of several options 
contained in a 26-page report issued by the Beverly Hills Unified School 
District's real estate committee. The committee is searching for ways to use 
real estate to improve the financial situation in the district, where parents 
and school officials fear that declining revenues will undermine a tradition of 
academic excellence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controversial Idea 
</P>
<P>
Despite the preliminary nature of the report, the proposal to demolish Beverly 
Hills High has already touched off a storm of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the most repugnant proposal I have witnessed in government," said Mayor 
Robert K. Tanenbaum. "I am not willing to sacrifice a generation of young 
people to be housed in Quonset huts or makeshift classrooms to have the 
district sell property. There are other ways to go about it." 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, committee chairman Kenneth Goldman said, "The high school 
site alone could be a billion-dollar development. It is possible to solve the 
financial problems of the district for the next five decades. Real estate is 
the only asset that will approach that." 
</P>
<P>
School districts all over California have been searching for ways to bolster 
sagging revenues ever since voters approved the tax-cutting Proposition 13 a 
decade ago. Beverly Hills -- which boasts celebrity alumni such as actors 
Richard Dreyfuss and Betty White -- has already tried star-studded 
fund-raisers, oil wells and, recently, a line of designer clothing decorated 
with the Beverly Hills High logo. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new proposal, the district would raze the existing high school 
building and construct a new "state-of-the-art high school" on the northern 19 
acres of the site. It would lease the remaining eight acres at Olympic 
Boulevard and Spalding Drive to a developer to construct an office complex. 
Depending on the size of the development, the district could earn up to $18 
million a year from this venture, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The real estate committee plans to schedule five public hearings on the 
proposal before it issues a final report to the school board sometime in the 
next two months. Most school officials were reluctant to discuss the issue this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
But school board President Dana Tomarken said, "I don't like it." 
</P>
<P>
"It deals with the bottom line economics needs and doesn't really assess the 
tremendous burdens that such a move would involve," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said that such a project would disrupt the education of thousands of 
students (the student body numbers 2,100) and it would require further study to 
determine the impact on traffic and density. 
</P>
<P>
But school board Vice President Frank Fenton said he needs more time before 
making a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
The important issue, Fenton said, is that the district be placed on a more 
secure financial footing. "If it meant putting the district on a financial 
course that would allow us to have the programs that we want and to give the 
benefits that we need to the teachers, I would tear the whole place down." 
</P>
<P>
The issue touched off a heated City Council debate this week when Mayor 
Tanenbaum strongly denounced the plan and asked that the city's zoning laws be 
revised to prevent the commercial development of properties designated for 
school use. Other council members decided to study the situation and wait to 
see what the school board does. 
</P>
<P>
Some early opponents say that the committee's proposal could stir up 
anti-development sentiments that have been dormant in the city since 1984, when 
voters defeated a referendum to build hotels ranging from 6 to 12 stories in 
the city's business district. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman, who chaired a group that fought to stop high-rise hotels, said the 
committee's proposal is different because the proceeds would support the 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a trade-off between commercial development and educational development," 
he said. "Clearly there are a number of people who do not want to disturb the 
status quo, but that will not solve the long-range needs of the district." 
</P>
<P>
School officials define those needs as the ability to lower class sizes, pay 
for higher salaries and provide better school facilities. Many parents and 
school officials feel that the district has been unable to maintain standards 
since it was stripped of its ability to raise taxes by Proposition 13. School 
officials have been forced to cut $3 million from the district's $27.6-million 
annual budget over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
The district spends more than $5,000 a year to educate each child, compared to 
a state average of about $3,000. The state gives Beverly Hills about $3,700 per 
child. To make up the difference, the district receives about $4.6 million a 
year from the city and about $500,000 in public donations. 
</P>
<P>
Oil revenues from wells operating on the high school campus dropped from $1.2 
million in 1982 to about $335,000 in 1988. The district expects to receive some 
income from the line of clothing being marketed with the high school logo, but 
the line has been delayed until spring. Thus far, the district has received 
from the clothing project only about $30,000, which came as part of a licensing 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
School Supt. Bob French said that by 1990 the board may ask the voters to 
approve a flat tax on each parcel of land in the district to support the 
schools. A similar tax lost by a narrow margin in a 1987 vote in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The real estate proposal could eliminate the need for a tax, but not everyone 
is impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"How crummy," snapped Joan Crawley McCarthy, who graduated from Beverly Hills 
High School in 1942. "It is such a beautiful old landmark. I'd love to think 
this would be defeated." 
</P>
<P>
Minde Sanders, 17, a senior, said: "No way. There is no reason to do that. The 
school is fine the way it is. We'd protest it."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: JOKES ABOUT 'THE GARV' SOUR PARTY FOR ATHLETES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It sounded like a swell idea: male and female athletes from high schools 
throughout San Diego County honored at a fancy banquet, with professional 
football players handing out the awards. 
</P>
<P>
But jokes about Steve Garvey's paternity problems and other mildly suggestive 
jibes by San Diego Charger Billy Ray Smith and former Chargers Kellen Winslow 
and Hank Bauer left at least some of the parents and school officials 
embarrassed and angry. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who were upset were the father of a girl receiving an award for her 
volleyball prowess and a San Diego high school principal who wishes she hadn't 
been invited. 
</P>
<P>
"The locker-room humor got going and they couldn't stop it," said John Deavers, 
student government adviser at Poway High School. "That would be all right for a 
Rotary or Kiwanis meeting but not for a banquet with teen-agers. These guys are 
supposed to be role models." 
</P>
<P>
Winslow asked a girl if she knew Garvey; Bauer wondered aloud how the male 
coaches react to having "gorgeous" young girls on campus, and Smith said Garvey 
should "lay off or cut it out." 
</P>
<P>
Former television sportscaster Mike Smith, whose video company, Image 
Producers, sponsored last week's banquet at the waterfront Marriott Hotel, says 
he is sorry that people were upset. The objectionable stuff began when the 
jocks departed from their prepared scripts and started to ad-lib. 
</P>
<P>
"The comments were out of place, and I hope people know we had no control over 
what the presenters would say," Smith said. "When we have something like this 
again, we'll sit down and talk about what is acceptable for a high school 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
Bauer, a radio sportscaster, said he is "ticked off" that anyone could 
interpret his comment as improper. He said he was merely trying to compliment 
the girls on their looks. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Ray Smith said his Garvey joke was a "feeble attempt at humor" and that 
"I'll be the first to apologize if anyone was offended." But he added that the 
adults should realize that the students are about to enter college, where they 
will hear much stronger stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Winslow did not return several messages left with his answering service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Pop and You're Out 
</P>
<P>
School officials in San Marcos have taken a tough stand against the latest rage 
on campus: small firecracker-like packages called "poppers," wrapped in tinfoil 
and sold at swap meets and in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 15 students have been expelled for possessing the illegal explosive 
devices and will not be readmitted until next fall, at the earliest. (The 
students are eligible to attend a county-run school for pupils with discipline 
problems or apply to other school districts.) 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos School Supt. Mac Bernd this week sent a note to all parents warning 
that there will be zero tolerance for poppers. 
</P>
<P>
The San Marcos response contrasts sharply with that of the San Diego school 
system, where students caught with poppers merely have them confiscated and are 
asked not to bring any more to campus, according to security chief Alex Rascon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Street-Smart Scalpers 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for Neil Diamond's April 17 concert at the Sports Arena sold out within 
two hours, but somehow, as always, the scalpers and brokers have plenty of 
tickets to sell, at a tidy profit. 
</P>
<P>
Two ticket hustlers hired 20-odd street people to sleep near the box office at 
the downtown Civic Theatre to be ready when sales began at 10 a.m. Monday. One 
of the two passed out cookies and sang off-key renditions of Diamond songs to 
keep the recruits focused on the task. 
</P>
<P>
As each street person approached the head of the line, he was slipped enough 
money for six tickets (the maximum allowed) at $20 each, plus a couple of bucks 
for his effort. Some were unsteady on their feet, others had the bruised faces 
that come with urban outdoor living. 
</P>
<P>
"One was so drunk he could barely stand," said one box-office employee, adding 
that she has seen nothing like the transients-as-proxies scheme in her 12 
years. Usually, the scalpers and brokers hire college kids, she said.

ESCAPE OF YOUTH WHO HURLED CONCRETE IS INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN MAREE SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities are searching for a teen-age boy -- convicted last year of throwing 
a chunk of concrete from a freeway overpass and severely injuring a motorist -- 
who escaped from a minimum-security juvenile facility, reportedly with the help 
of his mother, who was under court order not to see him. 
</P>
<P>
But the mother, interviewed by a San Diego television station, said she doesn't 
know the whereabouts of her son, even though she talks with him from "time to 
time." She also said the youth had been mistreated at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"He's cold. He's tired. He's hungry. He was getting beat up out there," Sharon 
Hendricks told TV station KFMB (Channel 8) in a brief interview about the 
disappearance of her 16-year-old son, Lance Hough. Speaking from behind a 
screen door, Hendricks, who lives in Golden Hill, said she wants her son "to 
get a fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Word of Mouth' 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Armour, chief of the juvenile division for the San Diego County district 
attorney's office, said the office is investigating whether Hendricks is 
involved in the escape. 
</P>
<P>
"All we have is word of mouth," he said, adding that the escape was not 
reported until a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
The escape was "not an unusual occurrence," Armour said. "It happens a lot. 
It's probably a daily occurrence, but this is a notorious case." 
</P>
<P>
The escape brought harsh words from the brother of Kurt Meyering, the 
24-year-old aspiring model who was injured. Meyering was sitting in the 
passenger seat of his girlfriend's newly purchased Corvette on Feb. 29, 1988, 
when a 6-pound chunk of concrete crashed through the sunroof as the couple were 
about to pass under the Pershing Drive overpass on Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
Meyering, who was in a coma for three months, underwent rehabilitation but has 
not regained his full mental capacity. He lives with his parents in Wenatchee, 
Wash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Predictable' 
</P>
<P>
Meyering's brother, Ralph, said Thursday that Hough's escape "was very 
predictable. This only goes to prove what we were trying to tell the judge a 
long time ago: This kid has got some serious problems. . . . I pray to God 
nobody else gets hurt. Nobody should have to go through what my family went 
through. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a bad movie, and the judge wrote the script," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hough escaped Feb. 19 from the St. John's School for Boys in Whitewater, near 
Palm Springs. According to authorities, an arrest order has been issued for the 
youth, who was convicted of three counts of assault with a deadly weapon. Also 
convicted for taking part in the incident was a 13-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
Hough was sent to the Southwood Psychiatric Residential Treatment Center in 
Chula Vista before being transferred to the residential school, said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Robert O. Amador, who prosecuted the case. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks, who was barred by Juvenile Court Judge Lawrence Kapiloff from seeing 
her son until she completed psychological treatment, was accidentally permitted 
by a probation officer to visit him Feb. 19 at St. John's, said Doug 
Willingham, deputy chief probation officer in charge of juvenile services in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"The mother was not supposed to have contact with her son until she went into 
therapy with the boy," Willingham said, but a probation officer missed the 
judge's order and failed to notify the school about the restriction. Officials 
from the school declined to comment on the escape. 
</P>
<P>
The mistake was made by a probation officer who "deals with thousands of court 
orders a month," Willingham said. "He missed that one item, and (Hough) 
happened to be a newsworthy kid. . . . Those things happen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the facility's fault. They were doing as they were supposed to do." 
Parental visits to the school are supervised, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Willingham, who also said such escapes occur daily, downplayed Hough's 
disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
"He was in an open setting. This is not the great jail escape. Every day 
someone AWOLs. There are over 300 juveniles from San Diego County in 50 open 
private facilities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Willingham said Hough was undergoing treatment by a psychiatrist and was 
participating in a group program at the school. He said the boy was "doing 
fine," before his escape. 
</P>
<P>
"He was there a short time, but he was quite treatable and making progress," he 
said.

L.A. SLOW TO SPEND FEDERAL HOUSING FUNDS, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a time when many Los Angeles public housing projects are mired in slum 
conditions, the City Housing Authority has taken up to five years to spend 
millions of dollars in federal housing improvement funds, an independent report 
has found. 
</P>
<P>
The study by the accounting firm of Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells, obtained by 
The Times, concluded that the Housing Authority has allowed numerous 
contracting delays in processing a total of $35 million in modernization funds 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The report said it takes the authority an average of 518 days to hire an 
architect and nearly three years to contract engineering work. These delays do 
not "reflect the urgency both HUD and (the Housing Authority) acknowledged when 
prioritizing and allocating funds to those projects," the report said. The 
report, received by board members in January, did not identify causes for the 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley said Thursday that he is aware of the delays and finds them 
unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mayor Sends Letter 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said he sent a letter to the Housing Authority saying: "The 
procedures take far too much time. I want them to reduce that time and take 
action immediately." 
</P>
<P>
At Bradley's request, the Housing Authority staff is expected to submit a 
proposal to trim the contracting period to one year at a board meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
The Housing Authority is in jeopardy of losing future modernization funds if 
the delays in contracting procedures continue, said HUD spokesman Scott Reed. 
</P>
<P>
The report, ordered by HUD officials last year, concluded that the Housing 
Authority has met a five-year deadline set by the federal government to spend 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
But, the report said, the money has been spent too slowly for renovation 
projects, given the substandard living conditions in many of the city's 21 
housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
The report follows recent disclosures in The Times that the Housing Authority 
lost $5 million in improvement funds for the dilapidated Jordan Downs housing 
project in Watts last fall after Executive Director Leila Gonzalez-Correa 
revealed a controversial plan to sell the project to a private developer. The 
Times also reported that Gonzalez-Correa has awarded contracts to her 
acquaintances and to political supporters of Bradley without using competitive 
bids as required by federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez-Correa declined to discuss the independent report on Thursday. But in 
an interview last month, she conceded that HUD officials are "very, very upset 
. . . that the money has not been expended as quickly as they would like. It's 
unconscionable to get money and take five years in spending this money when 
there are such needs out there," she said. Gonzales-Correa has headed the 
agency since October, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The report confirms complaints by low-income tenants that the Housing Authority 
has not fulfilled promises to repair broken-down kitchens, bathrooms, walls, 
windows and floors in the city's housing projects, said Charles F. Elsesser, a 
Los Angeles Legal Aid Foundation attorney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints From Residents 
</P>
<P>
"We often get complaints from residents about how long it takes to implement 
projects," Elsesser said. "The residents are saying that they were promised and 
told about these programs and how they were going to happen. Long periods of 
time went by and nothing occurred." 
</P>
<P>
Elsesser cited the multimillion-dollar face lift announced in July, 1987, by 
Bradley and Gonzalez-Correa for the huge Nickerson Gardens housing project in 
Watts. Under the plan, Nickerson Gardens is to be divided into village-like 
compounds with their own managers, color schemes, laundry facilities, 
playgrounds and additional landscaping and lighting. So far, the 1,064-unit 
project has received only a fresh coat of paint and new windows. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he learned of the unusual contracting delays recently when he 
became involved in a Housing Authority plan to use federal money from HUD's 
Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program to erect a security fence 
surrounding Jordan Downs. Bradley said Housing Authority officials told him it 
would take a year to prepare the fencing project before it could be forwarded 
to HUD for approval. 
</P>
<P>
"It took an entire year just to complete the review and recommendations; that 
is totally unacceptable to me. They must move much more expeditiously," Bradley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
HUD officials notified Gonzalez-Correa in a July 27, 1988, letter that they 
were "very concerned" about the Housing Authority's contracting delays. Reed 
said that HUD ordered the Housing Authority to use an independent consulting 
firm to study the problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commissioners Upset 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez-Correa did not tell board members she had commissioned the $9,500 
report until members were given copies of it at a January board meeting. 
Several commissioners became upset because the firm advised board members to 
allow Gonzalez-Correa more latitude in administering contracts at a time when 
they are seeking stricter controls on her spending activities. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported last month that the Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells consulting 
agreement was one of six contracts that Gonzalez-Correa had awarded without 
following federal procurement regulations. Gonzalez-Correa issued the 
consulting contract to Deloitte -- which has contributed $3,500 to the Bradley 
campaign since 1986 -- "without any evidence" of a competitive bid, the city 
attorney's office said in a Jan. 20 letter. 
</P>
<P>
The consultant's report uncovered several deficiencies in the Housing 
Authority's contracting procedures but failed to identify the causes, said Gary 
Squier, the mayor's liaison to the Housing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential answer is somebody is sitting on their hands not doing any work 
or they are not competent to run a rehabilitation project," Squier said. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Frederick M. Muir contributed to this story.

 HOSPITAL MAY HAVE MIXED UP NEWBORNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kaiser Permanente Hospital in West Los Angeles is investigating whether a 
mother was presented with the wrong baby when she left the maternity ward, 
spokesmen for the family and the hospital said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Rosetta Kirks of Inglewood gave birth on Feb. 11 and a few days later took home 
the baby she believed to be her new son, spokesman Shelly Shellmire said. As 
the days passed, however, the baby seemed smaller and shorter than when first 
born. 
</P>
<P>
Kirks reexamined the wristband that had identified the baby in the hospital and 
was shocked to see an unknown last name, Shellmire said. 
</P>
<P>
After several days of "panic," Kirks and her husband took the baby back to the 
hospital, where he will remain until the mix-up is sorted out. The Kirks were 
given blood tests, and Shellmire said the results should show whether they are 
the parents. 
</P>
<P>
Shellmire said hospital officials told him it was possible that the wristband 
was simply mislabeled or that the Kirks indeed had been given the wrong baby. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser refused to comment on details, offering only a statement saying it is 
"investigating the situation fully."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: PINE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An El Cajon man was convicted of second-degree murder Thursday in the slaying 
of a man whose mutilated body was recovered near Pine Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Ingham, 23, was convicted of stabbing the victim in the base of the 
skull in March, 1987. Scott Lee Hill, 27, of San Diego, also had his throat 
slashed. Another defendant, Lawrence Morris, 29, of San Diego, was convicted of 
first-degree murder in March, 1988. Ingham could be sentenced to 16 years to 
life April 6 by Superior Court Judge Terry B. O'Rourke. 
</P>
<P>
The motive for the slaying was revenge after Hill purportedly tried to rape 
Morris' wife while Morris was at sea with the Navy. Witnesses at the trial said 
they heard Morris talking openly with Ingham in a bar about killing Hill.

Kevin Eugene Cartwright, 21, the so-called "wishing-well bandit," was given the 
maximum sentence by Municipal Judge Jesus Rodriguez, who noted Cartwright's 
viciousness and cruelty when attacking his victims. Rodriguez said the victims 
were vulnerable and they suffered significant losses. 
</P>
<P>
Cartwright was sentenced to five years for the robbery of 84-year-old Rudy 
Lucas, who had a bottle broken over his head and was beaten and kicked. The 
robbery netted Cartwright $40 and a 1966 Buick, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Jeff Dusek. 
</P>
<P>
Cartwright will also serve one-year terms for five other robberies; he will not 
serve time in the two remaining robberies.

KILLER WHO WAS RULED INSANE DISAPPEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman declared insane after she killed her mother and slashed her daughter's 
throat with a razor eight years ago has disappeared from the psychiatric 
halfway house where she has lived since her release from a state mental 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Arlyne Louise Genger, 45, left Gateways Hospital in South-Central Los Angeles 
Tuesday morning after she received permission to go to the bank. She never 
returned, said Dr. Harry Goldberg, program director at the residential 
community mental health facility. 
</P>
<P>
Genger has lived at Gateway since June, when she was released from Patton State 
Hospital. She was committed there in 1981 after admitting that on New Year's 
Day, 1980, she stabbed her mother more than 20 times and cut her daughter's 
throat and wrist with a razor. The attacks took place in the family's North 
Hollywood apartment. 
</P>
<P>
After a court battle last April, Van Nuys Superior Court Judge C. Bernard 
Kaufman ruled on the basis of psychiatric testimony that Genger no longer was a 
threat to the community and should take continued psychiatric treatment at a 
halfway house with no physical restraints to keep patients on the premises.

 DYING CHILD'S WISH: TO MEET PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Make-a-Wish Foundation, an organization that grants wishes for 
terminally ill children, asked cystic fibrosis sufferer Jeffrey Baird what he 
wanted the most in the world, the Van Nuys boy thought it over. He decided 
against trying a stint as a guest DJ or meeting his favorite rock group, Guns 
'n' Roses. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Jeffrey, 12, will leave Saturday for Washington, where he is to meet 
President George Bush on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a few choices, and I couldn't really decide," Jeffrey said. "I said, 
'Which would be harder to do? Whatever that is would be the best one.' "

RALLY URGES TENURE FOR UCLA PROFESSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 350 supporters of UCLA professor Don Nakanishi assembled at the Westwood 
campus Thursday, calling for immediate tenure for the education instructor. 
Representatives of a broad range of mainly minority student groups voiced 
support for Nakanishi, who hopes to become the first tenured Asian-American in 
the UCLA Graduate School of Education. Nakanishi was first denied tenure in the 
fall of 1987, and his supporters have maintained that racism has played a role 
in the handling of the case. UCLA Chancellor Charles Young recently returned 
the case to the school of education for further study. In a statement Thursday, 
Young said the new review of the case is under way and will be resolved "as 
soon as possible."

BRADLEY PROPOSES SKID ROW HOTEL DEMOLITION BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an attempt to save the dwindling stock of low-cost housing on Skid Row, Los 
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley on Thursday proposed a measure aimed at preventing 
more demolitions of single-room-occupancy hotels in the city's neighborhood of 
last resort. 
</P>
<P>
"These hotels are our last defense against homelessness," Bradley said in a 
City Hall press conference to announce his plan. If the council approves, 
owners will not be allowed to tear down the hotels unless they pay the city 
$25,000 per room or build replacement housing in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Officials believe that the two-year measure will virtually halt the destruction 
of these hotels, known in street and bureaucratic shorthand as SROs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threat of Demolition 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of such hotels have been torn down in the last two decades, and scores 
more face the threat of demolition as development forces close in on the 
neighborhood from Little Tokyo on the north and the Central City business 
district on the west. 
</P>
<P>
A typical 10-foot by 12- to 14-foot room -- with a sink and bathing and toilet 
facilities down the hall -- rents for between $200 and $300 a month. Owners do 
not require deposits or last month's rent up front. Some of Skid Row's SROs are 
clean, quiet and well maintained. But others are plagued by roaches, rodents, 
drug dealers and occasionally prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the tenants, who can rent by the month or by the week, are on pensions, 
Social Security or welfare programs and cannot afford to spend much more on 
housing. The county's General Relief program, for instance, pays $312 to $349 
per month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just Scraping By' 
</P>
<P>
There are typically more vacancies near the end of the month, when money is 
short, than early in the month, when the welfare and General Relief checks are 
cashed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's people who are just scraping by," said Mike Neely of the Skid Row-based 
Homeless Outreach Project. 
</P>
<P>
"This ordinance will protect these tenants," Bradley said. "When an SRO hotel 
is demolished, tenants are often forced onto the streets." 
</P>
<P>
"They are the last rung on the housing ladder," said Councilman Michael Woo, 
who will introduce the measure in the council 
</P>
<P>
Recent attempts by the City Council to save the SROs have been ineffective and 
actually provided unintended incentives for some landowners to simply let their 
properties deteriorate or fall victim to mysterious fires, city housing chief 
Gary Squire said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Do It Right or Pay Off' 
</P>
<P>
But Bradley's proposal will force the hotel owners to "do it right or pay off 
the city," Neely said. 
</P>
<P>
The move was applauded by housing activists. Despite its tough enforcement 
provisions, it was not immediately challenged by area business interests. 
</P>
<P>
The city's shrinking stock of SRO hotels houses an estimated 6,000 to 7,000 
poor, aging and often disabled residents, according to estimates by the Skid 
Row Housing Trust, an organization dedicated to preserving the remaining 75 
hotels in the 50-block area east of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The SRO hotel residents differ somewhat from the general Skid Row population in 
that they are generally older -- in their 40s, 50s and 60s -- and the 
population is more racially balanced than the streets, where most residents are 
black, according to Neely and others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home for Decades 
</P>
<P>
Some residents make their homes in the SRO hotels for years, some for decades. 
And that is what makes Skid Row a community, said Alice Callaghan, founder of 
the Skid Row Housing Trust. 
</P>
<P>
The trust has organized nonprofit organizations to purchase and rehabilitate 
three SRO hotels on Skid Row and is in escrow to buy two more. The trust and 
its partners are negotiating to buy an additional two SROs and they hope to buy 
many more. 
</P>
<P>
The Community Redevelopment Agency, which is often criticized for not providing 
enough new low-cost housing in Los Angeles, has created the SRO Corp., which 
has purchased a dozen area hotels for rehabilitation.

SPRING BREAK IS WEEKEND WEATHER OUTLOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego is having nothing to do with the rapidly dwindling weeks of winter. 
As if impatient for the vernal equinox March 20, this weekend's weather is 
expected to plunge headfirst into very spring-like behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Warm temperatures and gentle sea breezes will reign today and Saturday, with 
slightly cooler conditions Sunday, the National Weather Service predicts. Night 
and early-morning low clouds will give way to mostly sunny skies through the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
This spring break is courtesy of a large low-pressure system extending from the 
Gulf of Alaska and a mild southwesterly air flow over San Diego, forecaster Dan 
Atkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Highs along the coast today and Saturday will be in the upper-60s, dropping to 
the mid-60s Sunday. Overnight lows will be in the mid-50s both nights, Atkin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The ocean temperature is 57 degrees. The surf is 2 to 4 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Inland highs today and Saturday will be about 77 degrees, dipping slightly into 
the low 70s Sunday. Lows both nights will be about 48, the forecast says. 
</P>
<P>
The mountains are expected to have highs in the mid- to upper-60s, and 
overnight lows in the upper-30s.

WOULD BE IMPOSED IN EMERGENCY; 
</P>
<P>
PANEL OKS STANDBY LIMIT ON HOUSING 
</P>

<P>
A San Diego City Council committee Thursday approved plans for a standby 
housing cap that could be imposed on a community or the entire city if home 
construction outstrips an area's ability to handle increased population. 
</P>
<P>
The "interim development standby ordinance" would allow the City Council to 
declare an emergency and temporarily limit home building in any part of the 
city based on a finding that the public health and welfare would be endangered. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-0 vote of the council's Transportation and Land Use committee sends the 
ordinance to the full council, which must approve it before the plan can become 
city law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8,000-Home Cap 
</P>
<P>
Residential construction in San Diego has been capped at 8,000 homes annually 
since August, 1987, under the city's interim development ordinance. Parts of 
the city and specific kinds of housing, such as housing for the poor, are 
exempt. 
</P>
<P>
The council in January approved a new growth-management plan that contains no 
housing cap and agreed to gradually lift the interim cap by May 21. Two 
long-term growth management plans that contained housing caps were defeated by 
voters Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan would offer the city protection against the kind of runaway 
construction that prompted the imposition of the existing housing cap in 1987. 
It would allow the council to declare that the rate of new home building was 
outstripping the capacity of roads, sewers, parks or schools to handle 
population increases. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance does not specify how severe conditions must become before the 
council could declare an emergency, nor who must initiate the proceedings to 
declare one. The council is scheduled to discuss a plan for monitoring 
development and its impact on public facilities next month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Majority Vote 
</P>
<P>
Imposition of the ordinance would require a majority vote of the nine council 
members based on "what, in their legislative discretion, they find is a need to 
act to preserve the health, safety and welfare of the community," said Janis 
Sammartino, a deputy city attorney who helped write the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Once a cap is imposed, the city's Planning Department would dole out building 
permits to developers based on a priority list contained in the ordinance. 
Housing for the poor, senior citizens, students and home building in 
redevelopment areas would be exempt from the cap. Other builders could apply to 
be released from the cap's provisions. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance could limit homes scheduled to be built under "development 
agreements" and other arrangements that give builders a "vested" right to 
construct homes. The agreements are contracts under which the city trades a 
guaranteed right to build a specific number of homes in return for early 
construction of roads, schools, parks, fire stations or other facilities needed 
by residents of the area. 
</P>
<P>
But James Milch, an attorney who has negotiated development agreements on 
behalf of large developers, said the contracts would give builders a strong 
argument for exemption from any temporary cap. 
</P>
<P>
Sammartino declined to comment on that issue.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: IT'S EASY TO SPOT THE DOBSON TOUCH AT GOLDEN 
TRIANGLE EATERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Dobson has christened his new Golden Triangle restaurant St. James Bar, 
but you will be safe in taking any odds you like that the popular name for it 
will be Dobson's North. 
</P>
<P>
Palatial in size contrasted with Dobson's signature eatery on Broadway Circle 
in downtown San Diego, this classy joint fills a desperate need for a 
top-drawer restaurant in the rapidly growing Golden Triangle. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone familiar with Dobson's style would have no more trouble identifying the 
place. The dining room, though gracious, is on the plain side and could use a 
little livening -- even something so simple as fresh flowers on the tables 
would help. The bar is unmistakably Dobson's -- a massive oak arrangement that 
takes up most of one wall, the back bar having been crafted a century ago for a 
saloon in Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the restaurant resembled a Southern California fern bar, the staff 
would instantly identify it as a Paul Dobson outpost. The chef, Jacques Pastor, 
moved up from downtown and brought his menu and his top-notch style with him, 
and the manager, the energetic but fastidious John Perkins, previously oversaw 
La Gran Tapa, Dobson's other downtown establishment. The two make an 
exceptional back-and-front-of-the-house pairing, and the service functions 
smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Menu Modifications Planned 
</P>
<P>
Pastor seems rather like a pleased monarch in his spacious new kitchen and said 
he expects to modify his menu and take it in perhaps more novel directions as 
time progresses. For the moment, it is virtually identical to the menu he 
cooked at Dobson's, which is in many ways saying a mouthful. Although it is 
written daily, the menu repeats many customer favorites and always includes the 
mussel bisque, Dover sole and Norwegian salmon that have become Dobson's 
mainstays. 
</P>
<P>
The current bill of fare leaves no room for complaint. A recent dinner list 
(which will vary from night to night, more in terms of sauces and garnishes 
than in principal ingredients) included such thoroughly attractive entrees as a 
half Maine lobster with lobster ravioli in a basil-flavored champagne sauce; 
broiled swordfish dressed with capers and lemon butter; a grilled veal chop in 
an unctuous sauce laced with old port (a favorite Pastor flavoring); sauteed 
veal medallions finished with a creamy grain mustard sauce infused with 
tarragon, and sauteed saddle of venison in an exuberantly lively sour cherry 
sauce. Garnishes are lovely; Pastor treats vegetables like tender treasures and 
sends out neat arrangements of perfectly cooked baby asparagus, French green 
beans bundled in bacon, gently sauteed potatoes and other gatherings from the 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
Two obvious innovations and definite improvements over the basic Dobson's style 
appear at opposite ends of the meal. The first is the plates of delicate amuse 
gueules (fanciful hors d'oeuvres) that arrive with drinks; the selection may 
include truffled duck pate on slices of buttery brioche, shrimp and a tangy 
tomato concasse (raw tomato sauce), also on brioche, and Armagnac-soaked prunes 
broiled inside bacon wrappers. These last are very much in Pastor's Southwest 
France heritage, and are exquisite. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tiny Truffles 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meal, pastry chef Michel Morlass sends out plates of 
mignardises, the tiny truffles and rich, clever pastries that traditionally 
accompany coffee at elegant French eateries. 
</P>
<P>
On a grander scale, Morlass daily turns out six or seven elaborate cakes and 
tarts, of which an exceptionally chocolaty example goes under the name of 
Golden Triangle cake. If dessert menus seem overloaded with chocolate these 
days, consider the imperial lime tart, a silken-textured confection with a 
nicely refreshing bite to it. 
</P>
<P>
The main events commence with such appetizers as a briny heap of black mussels 
steamed in cream, wine and shallots; the smooth mussel bisque, which sends up 
much aromatic steam from under its puff pastry crust when the waiter adds a 
shot of sherry at table, and a remarkable salad of translucent slices of 
marinated smoked salmon, formed into a purse around a filling of raw spinach. 
</P>
<P>
Other salads make excellent starters, most notably the rare duck breast slices 
spiraled over spinach and Belgian endive, the whole livened with raspberry 
vinaigrette, and the baked goat cheese, musky but demure in its garden patch of 
radichhio, oak leaf and Boston lettuces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simple Entrees 
</P>
<P>
The entrees, despite their Gallic glorification, are essentially quite simple 
and definitely most satisfying. A rectangle of Norwegian salmon, glamorously 
hatch-marked on the grill, married happily with its deep-toned saffron sauce. 
True Dover sole, flown in fresh from Holland, was presented as simply as 
possible, sauteed in the meuniere style that calls simply for butter and a few 
drops of lemon juice, and it virtually melted on contact. 
</P>
<P>
Pastor's personal recipe for osso bucco, or braised veal shank, was executed in 
a French style and, though nicely presented and beautifully tender, seemed 
rather restrained compared to the Italian original. Butter-crisped sweetbreads, 
crowned with sliced truffles and moistened with a scented truffle juice sauce, 
were perfect; this is another popular dish brought up from Dobson's. The 
lobster with lobster ravioli seemed relatively elaborate for this menu, and 
hinted at other happy complications Pastor may attempt in the future. 
</P>
<P>
When a French chef seasons a rack of lamb with but one herb, he usually chooses 
rosemary, which Pastor lavished upon a handsomely roasted rack that arrived 
carved into several meaty chops. 
</P>
<P>
As good as all this was, St. James Bar may become even more notable when Pastor 
expands into other types of dishes. Plans call for such offerings as breast of 
Muscovy duck, hot foie gras in Riesling sauce and quail stuffed with sweetbread 
mousse. Pastor also plans to employ a cook to prepare nothing but souffles, and 
not only dessert souffles, but entree-sized puffs filled with such savory 
concoctions as crayfish tails in Nantua sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The luncheon menu, which was not sampled, in many ways echoes the dinner menu, 
but at about half the price. Pastor's personal favorite may be a surprise, but 
he likes the massive hamburger, made with sirloin ground daily in his own 
kitchen. There are also a number of elaborate salads, and all the same 
appetizers offered at night. And, there is an excellent wine list of some 
depth.

TEACHER STABBING; 
</P>
<P>
9TH-GRADER TO STAY IN CUSTODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A juvenile court referee refused to release a ninth-grader accused of stabbing 
a teacher from custody Thursday, saying the student had planned the attack, 
showed the knife to other students and told them what he was going to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Several students had been told that he was going to stab the teacher ahead of 
time. They didn't believe him," Sylmar Juvenile Court Referee Lloyd Jeffrey 
Wiatt said at an arraignment hearing for the 15-year-old Pacoima youth. 
</P>
<P>
Wiatt ordered that the suspect remain in custody at the Sylmar Juvenile Hall 
pending the outcome of a trial set for March 28. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, whose name was not released because he is a minor, has been charged 
with carrying a knife on a school campus and with assault with a deadly weapon 
in the stabbing of English teacher Cynthia Edwards, 37. She was attacked Monday 
during an English class at Olive Vista Junior High School in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, of Palmdale, was stabbed in the back when she called the boy to the 
front of the classroom while she wrote a disciplinary report on him for using 
profanity. The knife, its 3 1/2-inch blade embedded to the hilt near Edwards' 
shoulder, was removed at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, where the 
teacher continued her recovery Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
At the arraignment hearing presided over by Wiatt, the slightly built suspect 
denied the assault charge, a move similar to entering a not guilty plea in 
criminal court. The suspect's arraignment on the charge of carrying the weapon 
on campus, which was added by prosecutors Thursday, was continued until March 
14. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parents Present 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, who wore a gray sweat shirt and black pants and sat at the 
courtroom defense table with his parents, did not speak during the hearing. 
After the denial of the assault charge, Los Angeles County Deputy Public 
Defender Mark R. Frazin asked Wiatt to release the youth to the custody of his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Frazin said the youth had strong community and family support and had no police 
record. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Michelle R. Rosenblatt opposed the suspect's 
release, saying that the accusations against him were "so heinous and so 
violent that detention is required." 
</P>
<P>
"He did it with planning and contemplation," Rosenblatt said. "It was not 
merely an act in anger." 
</P>
<P>
After noting that police reports on the incident say the suspect showed fellow 
students the knife and told them of his plan to attack Edwards, Wiatt ordered 
that the suspect remain in custody. Wiatt also said that the police reports say 
the boy admitted to investigators that he stabbed Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Warning 
</P>
<P>
Apparently because the students who were told of the planned attack did not 
believe the boy, they did not warn administrators or Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the suspect's parents, eight other relatives attended the hearing. 
The family members refused to discuss the case afterward. Frazin said the boy 
has received letters of support from former teachers and clergy members from 
the Pacoima area. 
</P>
<P>
If the suspect is convicted of the charges, he can face a punishment ranging 
from probation where he will be allowed to live at home to incarceration at a 
California Youth Authority prison.

VAN NUYS BOY HEADED FOR WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President George Bush may have his hands full when he meets Van Nuys resident 
Jeffrey Baird on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey wants to pin down the President about his plans now that Secretary of 
Defense nominee John Tower has been rejected; he wants to know what Bush really 
does all day in the White House, and he wants Bush to create another federal 
holiday: a day off for kids. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey is 12 years old, although his battle with cystic fibrosis has left him 
smaller than his 8-year-old brother. Through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, an 
organization that grants wishes to terminally ill children, he and his family 
are scheduled to leave for Washington on Saturday and see the President on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He also plans to tour the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing -- because "I 
like money" -- climb to the top of the Washington Monument and observe Congress 
in action. 
</P>
<P>
While Jeffrey is excited about his trip, it is not quite what he wished for. He 
wanted to be president. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a few choices, and I couldn't really decide," Jeffrey said Thursday 
morning during a send-off celebration at Van Nuys Hospital, where his father 
works. "I said, 'Which would be harder to do? Whatever that is would be the 
best one.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Washington trip won out over spinning records at radio station KIIS or 
meeting his favorite rockers, Guns N' Roses. Was he shooting a little high? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, but I'm kind of known for that," Jeffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey was diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis when he was 3 years old, after 
suffering nearly constant colds, allergies and breathing problems. It is a 
degenerative genetic disease that attacks the digestive system first, then 
turns mucous in the lungs "almost to tar," said Mary Schraeger, director of 
special events for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Greater Los Angeles chapter. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey's only outward sign, besides his small stature, is a nagging cough. But 
Schraeger said children suffering from cystic fibrosis lose weight, lose 
stamina and eventually succumb to lung infections and diseases such as 
emphysema and pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no cure, but we are getting very close," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Make-A-Wish Foundation heard about Jeffrey six months ago through 
Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, where he has been a frequent patient. Judy 
Lewis, executive director of the foundation's Los Angeles chapter, said the 
turnover of administrations in Washington caused some delay in granting the 
wish. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said they were surprised when Jeffrey asked to be president instead of 
choosing one of the more common wishes, such as a Nintendo game or a meeting 
with a movie star. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey's sister, 9-year-old Kimberly, said she would wish for a trip to Disney 
World in Florida and "a thousand bucks to spend." Kimberly also has cystic 
fibrosis. 
</P>
<P>
But Jeffrey's spunk did not surprise his mother, Doris, who said he became 
mature beyond his years by facing things most adults could not handle. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey cannot remember staying well long enough to spend a full week in 
school. He is a seventh-grader in a special program for sick and handicapped 
students at Porter Junior High School in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
He takes up to 52 pills a day, Doris Baird said. He used to end up in the 
hospital every year or so, but recently he has been admitted nearly once a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a terrible, awful place," Jeffrey said of the hospital. "But it's not 
my favorite place either." 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey has seen two of his friends die of the disease and a third become too 
sick to play. In fact, his mother said it was after his hospital roommate died 
several years ago that he realized the seriousness of his illness. 
</P>
<P>
"He sort of changed then," she said. "He got quieter, more introspective." 
</P>
<P>
When he was younger, Jeffrey wanted to become a fighter pilot when he grew up. 
Recently, he told his mother he didn't think he would ever realize that dream. 
</P>
<P>
But neither parents nor child have given up. In fact, when the Make-A-Wish 
Foundation contacted them, Doris Baird had misgivings about participating in 
something that sounded so final. 
</P>
<P>
"It tends to make a statement I wasn't ready to make," she said. "I'm going to 
fight as long as I can, and he'll fight too . . . . I will not accept a 
terminal diagnosis until this kid is dead."

DISPUTED VOTES COULD CHANGE 2 REDONDO RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Redondo Beach election officials today plan to count up to 24 ballots that were 
not included in the vote totals after Tuesday's election and could change the 
outcome of the school board contest and a City Council race. 
</P>
<P>
The count will be taken in the city clerk's office after officials from the 
county registrar-recorder's office finish checking the 24 ballots, which were 
withheld Tuesday night for verification, and determine which of them qualify. 
</P>
<P>
In the council race, District 1 candidate Valerie Dombrowski received 465 
votes, or 49.7% of the 936 ballots counted Tuesday night. That is just four 
votes short of the 50%-plus-1 total she needed to avoid a runoff and be 
declared the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Dombrowski's May 16 runoff rival -- unless enough votes are added to her column 
to make her the winner -- is Terry Ward, who received 417 votes, or 44.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Gregory, a deputy city clerk and elections administrator, said Thursday 
that the 24 uncounted ballots were scattered among the city's 27 voting 
precincts and five council districts. Consequently, not all of the ballots that 
qualify will affect the District 1 race. 
</P>
<P>
In the three-way contest for two seats on the Redondo Beach City School 
District board, incumbent Rebecca Sargent easily won reelection with 38.1% of 
the citywide vote. But board President Howard Huizing, who had been 
unofficially declared the second winner, received only eight votes more than 
challenger Andrew Deliman. 
</P>
<P>
To reverse that outcome, Deliman would need a net gain of nine votes from the 
uncounted ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory said most of the ballots were put on a "provisional" status by 
inspectors at the polling places Tuesday night after questions were raised 
about their validity. The most frequent reason, she said, was that the voter's 
name did not appear on a precinct's roster of registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
In many of those cases, she said, the voter may insist that a mistake has been 
made in the roster. The registrar-recorder's office then checks the challenged 
ballots against its list of voters. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory said it is common in elections for a few ballots to be pulled out for 
verification. They don't make a difference in the outcome except in close 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
The 24 votes, even if all are validated and counted, are not enough to change 
the outcome for council candidate Barbara Doerr, who won the District 1 seat, 
or for mayoral runoff candidates Brad Parton and Frank Bostrom. 
</P>
<P>
The council is scheduled to review and approve the election outcome Tuesday 
after the vote canvassing is completed.

3 CHARGED WITH STEALING PETS FOR EXPERIMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors filed felony charges Wednesday against three San Fernando Valley 
residents accused of luring pet owners into giving away dogs and cats that were 
then sold to medical laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, most of the animals died in experiments at the laboratories, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Ann Ruggiero, 25, Frederick John Spero, 43, both of Sylmar, and Ralf 
Jacobsen, 25, of Chatsworth were charged with 40 counts of felony theft of an 
animal for medical research purposes and with conspiracy to steal an animal for 
medical research, Deputy Dist. Atty. Norman Montrose said. 
</P>
<P>
The three were charged with 73 misdemeanor theft and conspiracy charges Sept. 
8. However, those charges are expected to be dismissed when the three 
defendants appear for arraignment in San Fernando Municipal Court on March 16, 
Montrose said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Felony Charges 
</P>
<P>
The felony charges were filed at the request of Ruggiero and her attorney, 
Robert Swanson, Montrose said. Deputy City Atty. Norman T. Wegener, one of the 
prosecutors in the case, said the stepped-up charges have some potential 
advantages for the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Wegener said the felony charges entitle the defendants to a preliminary 
hearing, which would give them a chance to have some of the charges against 
them dismissed before going to trial. But Wegener said that if convicted of the 
felony charges, the defendants could face stiffer penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Jacobsen and Spero said the felony charges were filed over their 
clients' objections. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants were scheduled to appear for arraignment Thursday, but Ruggiero 
and her attorney were not present. 
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero, the owner of two defunct Sun Valley kennels, along with Spero 
operated Biosphere, a company licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to 
sell animals for medical research. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Ruggiero and Spero hired Jacobsen to obtain animals for 
free that were then sold to three Southern California research facilities for 
as much as $500 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen got the animals by responding to classified advertisements offering 
free pets to good homes, according to prosecutors.

CENTINELA HOSPITAL FILES SUIT TO BLOCK FACILITY FOR MENTALLY ILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Centinela Hospital Medical Center filed a lawsuit Thursday aimed at preventing 
construction of a center for severely mentally ill patients across the street 
from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital had threatened to file the suit after the Inglewood City Council 
last week approved construction of the 14-bed facility, to be operated by the 
Didi Hirsch Community Mental Health Center. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit names the city, City Council members and Hirsch officials and seeks 
to overturn the council vote as "arbitrary and capricious," hospital Vice 
President Eric Tuckman said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, says city officials disregarded 
the danger the facility could pose for the neighborhood. It also asserts that 
city lawyers erroneously interpreted a state law that bars discriminatory 
treatment of mental institutions to mean that council members could not 
consider the type of patients to be treated at the facility, Tuckman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials say the severely mentally ill patients, who will live at the 
center for up to two weeks and can come and go as they please, will endanger 
Centinela's employees and patients. City and Hirsch officials disagree and 
accuse the hospital of fomenting discrimination against the mentally ill. They 
also say state and city law require approval of the proposed facility. 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch officials deny that the patients will pose any danger because they will 
be screened for admission. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the filing of the lawsuit, City Manager Paul Eckles said: "That's 
their privilege. That's why we have courts. But I would be very surprised if 
they could prevail." 
</P>
<P>
The hospital also alleges in the suit that City Council members held at least 
one illegal private meeting to discuss the issue before the Feb. 28 vote. 
Tuckman said hospital officials have information that such a meeting or 
meetings took place. Eckles said that he knows of no such meeting and that the 
council adheres scrupulously to state public meeting laws. 
</P>
<P>
The legal action is only part of Centinela's all-out campaign against the 
psychiatric center. Hospital officials said Thursday that they will try to 
bring the Hirsch proposal to the voters by collecting signatures for a ballot 
initiative that would prohibit the center -- planned for the 1000 block of 
Myrtle Avenue -- through a zoning change. One possibility would be a proposal 
to rezone the area from its current mixed residential-medical use to an 
exclusively residential zoning, Tuckman said. 
</P>
<P>
Eckles said that would be ironic because the city changed the zoning from 
residential to medical several years ago partly to accommodate expansion by the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Although Centinela and Hirsch representatives met Tuesday with Councilman 
Anthony Scardenzan in an attempt to resolve the matter, a compromise does not 
appear imminent. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Scardenzan said his wife, Franca, a member of the Centinela women's 
auxiliary, was told after the council vote that she could no longer work as a 
volunteer at the hospital. The Scardenzans say it was in retaliation for the 
council vote. 
</P>
<P>
But hospital President Russell Stromberg said Councilman Scardenzan's wife has 
not been dismissed. Rather, he said she was told it would be in her best 
interest not to work at the hospital while the controversy continues, because 
some employees are upset about the city's action. Stromberg said Franca 
Scardenzan may still work as a volunteer at an Inglewood thrift shop owned by 
Centinela Hospital.

HIGHEST AWARD;

<P>
GARDENA ART TEACHER GETS 'BRAVO' FOR EXCELLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The day after winning a Bravo Award for excellence in teaching the arts, 
Gardena High School teacher Phila McDaniel was elated but already looking ahead 
to other goals. 
</P>
<P>
After more than three decades as a teacher, the award "is a shot in the arm," 
McDaniel said. "You go along so far and you feel you've given your all. After 
33 years, you need something like this." 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel was one of three teachers who shared the 1988 Bravo Award, given 
annually by the Music Center for outstanding achievement in arts education. The 
winners were announced Monday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The award has given her an incentive to apply for grants to help improve 
Gardena High's arts program, McDaniel said. She is also planning to write grant 
proposals seeking money to maintain the school's extensive private collection 
of paintings by California artists, accumulated since 1919 from donations by 
Gardena High alumni. 
</P>
<P>
A veteran teacher and visual artist whose classroom instruction focuses on 
painting, art history, photography, film and video, McDaniel, 57, was one of 
two first-place winners who tied in the arts specialist category. A third award 
was given in the generalist category. 
</P>
<P>
According to Music Center spokeswoman Connie A. Rivera, this was the first time 
in the award's seven-year history that three educators shared the prize. 
Usually, two winners are named, one for incorporating the arts into a 
traditional classroom and one for achievement as an arts specialist. 
</P>
<P>
The other winners were Taffy Patton, who integrates the arts into her 
sixth-grade curriculum at Vena Magnet School in Pacoima, and Barrie Becker, who 
teaches dance at a Juvenile Court school in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The three winners were chosen from 97 Southland educators nominated by their 
principals. Ten finalists were announced in December. Each finalist was 
observed in the classroom by a panel of judges before the winners were chosen. 
The judges were educators and artists, including a representative from the 
charitable Jeffery Melamed Memorial Fund, which sponsors the competition. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the Bravo winners received a statuette designed by artist William 
Crutchfield. The winners also received $500 gift certificates from Robinson's 
and audio equipment from Audiotronics for their schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like an Oscar' 
</P>
<P>
For McDaniel, who was a Bravo finalist last year, finally getting the award was 
a high point in a long teaching career that is not over yet, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like getting an Oscar -- the Academy Award for teachers," McDaniel said. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel, who lives in Rancho Palos Verdes, was cited by the award committee 
for her ability to help students realize their artistic potential. 
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely believe that the arts are basic to all educational programs at all 
levels of schooling and that art is not a frill, but truly the heart of 
education," McDaniel wrote to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
She was also lauded for her campaign to create an art museum on the Gardena 
campus, and for her pioneering research on the folk art of China's ethnic 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being an art teacher and collector, McDaniel is also a photographer and 
world traveler who has led 17 tour groups to remote areas of China since the 
country opened its doors to Western tourists in 1979. She is preparing to lead 
her 18th tour of China in June. 
</P>
<P>
The Bravo Award was "a huge thrill," McDaniel said, and it has renewed her 
dedication to her first love, teaching. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll keep me going another five or 10 years," she said.

AVOIDS IMPLIED CRITICISM OF ROBERTI;

ROBBINS OPPOSES GUN BAN, YET DOES NOT VOTE

<P>
Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) on Thursday could have joined a majority of his 
colleagues in voting to approve a controversial bill to ban the sale and 
possession of military-style assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Or he could have sided with opponents of the bill by Senate President Pro Tem 
David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he abstained from casting a vote on the measure, which was approved 
and sent to the Assembly by a 27-12 margin. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not want to make any comment critical of Sen. Roberti," Robbins said. 
Even though Roberti pressed him to support the measure, Robbins said: "I didn't 
feel I could give him what he wanted, but I felt that the kindest I could be . 
. . was to sit quietly at my desk." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roberti Unaffected 
</P>
<P>
Roberti acknowledged that he urged Robbins to support his bill but did not 
consider it "untoward pressure." He quickly added that he was not offended by 
his colleague's abstention. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would ban the manufacture, sale, general possession and transfer of 
semiautomatic military assault weapons, such as the Soviet-designed AK-47. It 
is sponsored by top law-enforcement officers throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
While he did not object to the measure on the floor, Robbins in an interview 
criticized Roberti's bill and said he opposes gun controls. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said that if Roberti's proposal is approved in the Assembly and signed 
into law by Gov. George Deukmejian, it would be a step toward further 
restrictions on guns. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that this bill which deals with weapons like the AK-47 could 
potentially be used against individuals and law-abiding citizens who have small 
weapons for protection in their homes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Constituents Speak 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said that calls and letters to his office have overwhelmingly opposed 
Roberti's bill. He said the tally was 1,361 against and 398 for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
While Robbins was abstaining, Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), a former Los Angeles 
police chief, championed the opposition. He assailed the proposal as an 
unconstitutional restriction on the right to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Davis, another San Fernando Valley-area lawmaker, Sen. Newton Russell 
(R-Glendale), opposed the Roberti bill. In addition to Roberti, among those 
favoring the measure were Sens. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara) and Herschel 
Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles).

SQUABBLES KEPT AZTECS IN THEIR PLACE 
</P>

<P>
The record will say the season ended for the San Diego State basketball team 
Wednesday night with a loss to Utah in the preliminary game of the Western 
Athletic Conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
But the beginning of the end came two months earlier and 45 miles to the south, 
when SDSU blew a 15-point, second-half lead at Brigham Young and lost, 85-81. 
The defeat knocked the Aztecs out of a first-place tie in the WAC and started a 
downward trend they would never reverse. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the game, the internal bickering that would contribute to the 
Aztecs' downfall spilled into the open. The next two months were a time of 
turmoil, suspensions and injuries that carried to the final minutes of the 
final game. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play particularly well at BYU, but even at that we were up by 15," 
SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg said. "Then, through one reason or another, we ended 
up losing that basketball game. That was a major disappointment. That's when 
the finger-pointing began that set the stage for the rest of the season." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs went on two nights later to lose at Utah, 80-61. Senior guard Bryan 
Williams peppered his post-game comments with criticism of senior center Mitch 
McMullen, who scored a career-low two points. It was a rare public uttering of 
the conflict within, but the damage was done. 
</P>
<P>
"If I took a realistic approach, I could see we had the potential to become a 
fragmented team," Brandenburg said. "I could see some real strong signals early 
when we didn't react well at Texas Tech (a 58-43 loss Dec. 5). We didn't handle 
adversity well, and that bothered me. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually I can see some of those little signals and start doing some talking to 
work those things out. But I didn't see it coming like it did. Once it 
happened, I started doing the talking, but it was so sudden, so quick and so 
devastating. 
</P>
<P>
"The slippage that took place after the first road trip was a landslide 
slippage that I still am amazed at. I have tried to get a finger on it, but the 
gravity and the extent of it almost baffles me." 
</P>
<P>
The loss at BYU began a slide in which the Aztecs lost 13 of their last 17 
games, including 13 of their final 15 against conference teams. Their 12-17 
record was the same as last season, Brandenburg's first at SDSU, but their 4-10 
conference mark was a one-game drop. 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg said his preseason expectations were for the team to finish around 
.500. And after an 8-4, 2-0 start, he said he began to think his projections 
might be too low. That never seemed truer than when the Aztecs opened their WAC 
season at home by beating eventual champion Colorado State, 62-57. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the best game we put together in the two years I've been here," 
Brandenburg said. "It wasn't even close. We outfought and outscrapped Colorado 
State and beat them into submission. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at an all-time high after that game. I was thinking we had really made 
some progress." 
</P>
<P>
But it began to unravel the next week on the trip to BYU and Utah. The injuries 
and illnesses that were to haunt the Aztecs over the next several weeks began 
to have an effect. 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward Sam Johnson missed the BYU game with a sprained ankle, and it 
would be several weeks before he was at full strength. Williams, slowed by the 
flu, played one of his worst games at BYU. And junior reserve guard Rodney 
Jones sprained his ankle at Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulties continued at home when McMullen developed a sore Achilles 
tendon. McMullen, the team's leading scorer and rebounder, would not be the 
same for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
All of this helped contribute to a five-game losing streak, the longest in 
Brandenburg's 13 seasons as a college coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs had begun to regain their health and confidence with an 89-74 home 
victory over BYU Feb. 9 when the worst crisis of the season struck. Bryan 
Williams was suspended for the season after his arrest for petty theft. 
Williams had earlier served a one-game suspension for missing curfew after a 
game at Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks later, as the team prepared for its final regular-season games at 
New Mexico and Texas El Paso, junior guard Michael Best was suspended for what 
Brandenburg said were "medical reasons." School policy, he said, prevented him 
from commenting further. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Williams and Best left the Aztecs with only two scholarship guards 
-- Tony Ross and Jones -- neither of whom were experienced at running the 
offense. They went on to lose the two road games by a combined 54 points. 
</P>
<P>
"After we lost those two guards, the players made some valiant efforts," 
Brandenburg said, "but realistically, we were just playing out the season." 
</P>
<P>
It was during that last week that the splits within the team became more 
noticeable -- especially the tension between Brandenburg and Ross. 
</P>
<P>
That conflict reached its peak Wednesday against Utah when Ross, the team's 
best outside shooter, spent the last 4 minutes of the 70-57 loss on the bench 
after an argument with assistant coach Kevin McLeod. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute was the culmination of a season-long test of nerves between 
Brandenburg and Ross, the team's leading scorer in each of his first two 
seasons. Brandenburg had suspended Ross from a preseason game for disciplinary 
reasons, and the tension between the two could be seen that night in Provo 
when, after the loss to BYU, a disturbed Ross declined to comment about the 
reasons for the second-half collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say anything because if I said something, it would be the 
wrong thing," Ross said. It was a thought he would repeat throughout the 
season, the last time after Wednesday's loss. 
</P>
<P>
The benching of Ross was the last of several measures Brandenburg took in an 
effort to discipline his team. Six of the 13 players were suspended for a game 
or more or banned from team activities during the season. Three -- freshmen 
Dana Jackson, Alex Sund and Eeric White -- were suspended after a 
fighting-and-drinking episode in late December. Sund, whose jaw was broken by 
White, left the team and said he will transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg said he is at a loss to explain the rash of disciplinary problems. 
But he cited several weaknesses in team makeup that contributed to the slide: 
overconfidence built by early success, a lack of the kind of senior leadership 
Rodney Hawkins provided last season and frustration caused by losing. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his players agree that as the team slid, unity suffered. 
</P>
<P>
"At first we came out and tried to work with each other," senior forward Shawn 
Bell said, "but as we got deeper into the season, things started to wear on us. 
And without trying to cause problems, some of the players tried to do too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Said McMullen: "We had such high expections for ourselves in early January, and 
after we lost at Utah, we were just so crushed. We lost sight of how early in 
the season it was. We just got so down that we were not in first place anymore, 
and we never really got it together after that." 
</P>
<P>
With his second losing season ever over, Brandenburg must turn his attention to 
next season. The Aztecs lose their entire starting front line -- Bell, Johnson 
and McMullen -- and the status of their backcourt is in question. Best's is to 
be determined, and Brandenburg and Ross face the possibility of a final stormy 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs have signed at least two players for next season who could provide 
immediate help -- forward Courtie Miller of Torrey Pines High School and guard 
Ray Barefield of Fresno Hoover. But Brandenburg said he likely will have to 
find two community college players to help fill the gap in the front court. 
</P>
<P>
He realizes he still has some work to do before he can take the Aztecs to the 
next step in his three-stage rebuilding plan: competitive, contender, serious 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
"At times, we had the potential of moving from competitive to being a 
contender," Brandenburg said. "But after this, I would say we're still at the 
competitive stage."

</P>
<P>
PADRES' NELSON SAYS DYSLEXIA ISN'T WHY HIS CAREER IS STUCK

Rob Nelson, a first base prospect for the Padres, had just livened up an 
intrasquad game by powering a ball about 425 feet over a right field fence and 
into a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you get all of it?" someone jokingly asked him after he crossed home 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
"If you saw it come down," he said with a shrug, "then I didn't get all of it." 
</P>
<P>
Such has been the attitude Nelson has taken toward a six-year pro career that 
has yet to stop in the big leagues for more than a couple of hours at a time. 
Nelson has learned that for him to be a given a steady chance, he must prove 
himself beyond a trace of doubt, darn near hitting balls so far they are never 
seen again. 
</P>
<P>
Some may say that's just baseball. But Nelson sometimes wonders if it has more 
to do with a learning disability that baseball people do not understand. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson has dyslexia, which affects processing of the written or spoken word. In 
Nelson's case, he has difficulty reading, sometimes seeing the letters 
reversed, sometimes missing letters and words entirely. He does not read books 
because the process is so painstaking and frustrating. But he has learned to 
read magazines and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"And I can read a lineup card," Nelson said. "In this game, isn't that enough?" 
</P>
<P>
He wonders if baseball people believe that. 
</P>
<P>
He says he was denied an appropriate signing bonus out of Mt. San Antonio 
College when "an Atlanta Braves scout told me that because I had dyslexia, I 
could never get the kind of money I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
He then signed with Oakland. After hitting double figures in home runs in the 
minor leagues for four consecutive seasons, he opened the 1987 season as the 
A's starting first baseman. But he lasted just seven games. With a .167 
average, he was replaced by Mark McGwire, sent to triple-A Tacoma and later 
traded to the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Said Karl Kuehl, A's director of player development: "We feel his disability 
had nothing to do with his baseball ability . . . but we knew we had to treat 
Robbie a little differently." 
</P>
<P>
Last year for the Padres' triple-A Las Vegas farm team, Nelson hit 23 homers 
with 77 RBIs, but he made the major leagues for just seven more games and 
struggled again with a .190 average. This winter in contract negotiations, Tom 
Romenesko, Padre farm director, brought up the disability again. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel dyslexia affects him like another player is affected by a muscle pull 
or sore finger," Romenesko said. "We believe it's an eye muscle problem that 
can affect his swing. If you look at his scouting reports, there is a certain 
pitch he can't hit, and we wonder if it's because he can't properly track the 
ball as it comes from the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"If he works on it, it's no big deal, just like the guy with the pulled muscle. 
He is major-league caliber player who will probably play a lot of years in the 
big leagues. We are very high on him. He just has to keep working on his 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson and experts from the Hillside Development and Learning Center in La 
Canada -- where he was tutored as a youngster -- strongly disagree with this 
assessment. It's not that they feel Nelson doesn't need to keep working on his 
hitting. They simply say dyslexia has nothing to do with hitting. 
</P>
<P>
"That is absolutely ludicrous, that is dangerous talk," said Bob Dannenhold, 
executive director of the Hillside Center. "Rob had problems reading, but 
reading is a language process while baseball is a motor skill. And Rob was 
always a whiz at motor skills. 
</P>
<P>
"And Rob's reading problems have nothing to do with his eyes. You don't read 
with your eyes, you read with your brain." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, 24, hit the Padres' first two homers of the spring Thursday in a 7-7 
tie with Cleveland that was called after 10 innings. It probably won't do him 
any good. He understands he is the club's fourth first baseman behind Jack 
Clark, Carmelo Martinez and John Kruk. He understands he will probably return 
to triple-A and knows that in this instance, it has nothing to do with what 
anybody thinks about his ability to read. 
</P>
<P>
He knows he needs work. In 65 big league at-bats he has 11 hits (.169 average) 
with 33 strikeouts and just four walks. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not because I see the ball backward or anything," he said. "I don't 
see the rotation wrong. It's not like a slider looks like a screwball. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, so I can't read Bill White's signature on a fastball going 90 m.p.h. Who 
can? And who has to?" 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise quiet and subdued, Nelson's voice raises and his face reddens when 
talking about what Dannenhold calls, "The curse of being labeled." 
</P>
<P>
"If teams are holding being dyslexic against me," Nelson said, "then why am I 
even here? Why am I even trying? If anybody would ever ask me about this -- and 
they never really have -- I would love to sit down and honestly tell them just 
what it's like." 
</P>
<P>
Start in the seventh grade, when Nelson's teacher phoned his parents to discuss 
his poor grades. He was taken to Hillside for testing, where he and his family 
first heard the word "dyslexia." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't understand it," recalled his father, David. 
</P>
<P>
"I just saw things differently," Rob said. "I would read something real fast 
and not be able to tell you what I read. Words and letters would be missing or 
turned around." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson was sent to Hillside for tutoring twice a week. And his father added 
another brand of therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"I would bring him the morning sports section and get him to read it," David 
Nelson said. "I would ask him what happened that day, talk about what he read. 
It got so, if he took his time, he was having no problems with it." 
</P>
<P>
Experts say that often, dyslexics have a fear of failure. The Nelsons combated 
this through another unique therapy -- baseball. Rob began spending the 
majority of his time on fields, moving up through youth baseball and on to the 
South Pasadena High varsity as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as a person is labeled as dysfunctional, sometimes he loses his self 
confidence, he becomes afraid to risk anything in social situations," explained 
Jeff Spencer, Nelson's tutor at Hillside and an Olympic cyclist in 1972. 
"That's why sports was so good for Rob. It was different. He could compete 
there. There is no telling what toll this labeling would have had on him if he 
had not been so good in sports." 
</P>
<P>
"It's what I tell people today," Nelson said. "If anything, my dyslexia is an 
advantage in baseball because all my life I've had to learn verbally and 
through what I see. I'm a great listener and watcher. And that's how you learn 
in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
If only it had been so easy in the other parts of his life. 
</P>
<P>
His therapy at Hillside ended in ninth grade because, "They told me they 
couldn't help me anymore, that I had advanced as far as I could," Nelson said. 
But it wasn't far enough. 
</P>
<P>
He did poorly throughout high school, collecting mostly Cs, mostly because he 
never read the material. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget the size of my biology book," Nelson recalled. "To me, it 
was so thick, I didn't have a chance. I worked so hard, and still pulled a 'D'. 
" 
</P>
<P>
Then there were the difficult classes -- "The ones that made us read aloud," 
Nelson said. "Anytime they would ask us to read, I would slump lower and lower 
in my chair. There were always a couple of kids who could talk real good, real 
fast, great speech. I was always so envious." 
</P>
<P>
He attached himself increasingly to baseball, where with his bat and glove, he 
was the fast learner. 
</P>
<P>
"As a sophomore I first realized, hey, baseball is the way I can go to 
college," he said. "Baseball is how I can make my career. This was my 
opportunity. Compared to everything else, this was like, easy." 
</P>
<P>
At least he thought so. During his senior year of high school, a season that 
would be good enough to get him drafted by Houston, he applied to UCLA. He was 
so excited that he drove over and handed his application to the athletic 
department himself. 
</P>
<P>
He never heard from them until five years later, in 1987, when a UCLA athletic 
official he won't identify saw him playing with the Padres in Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy walked up to a friend of mine and said, 'Oh look, there's Rob Nelson, 
I'm so glad he overcame his learning disability,' " Nelson said. "Man, did that 
burn me." 
</P>
<P>
Snubbed by UCLA after he graduated from high school in 1982, he enrolled in Mt. 
San Antonio College. But six months later, he felt burned again by what he felt 
was a misconception. 
</P>
<P>
He was taken in the first round of the secondary phase of the January 1983 
draft by Atlanta. Soon thereafter, the Braves scout walked into the Nelson's 
living room and offered a $25,000 bonus, about $30,000 less than Nelson's 
opening demand. Then, according to Nelson, the scout said there would be no 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me I wouldn't get any more of that because of my dyslexia," Nelson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
That talk might have worked if the scout was just speaking to a 
then-impressionable Rob. But unfortunately for the scout, Nelson's mother 
Jacquie was also sitting there. 
</P>
<P>
"She jumped all over him," Nelson recalled. "Told him he had not done his 
homework, that he did not know what he was talking about. The guy left in a 
huff and said I would never get another chance." 
</P>
<P>
He hit 17 homers in 35 games for the junior college that spring and ensured 
that he would get another chance, this time with Oakland. The A's, according to 
Karl Kuehl, understood. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized we had to verbalize things more with him," the A's farm director 
said. "We had to check and make sure he understood things. With him, in 
teaching, we always took his disability into consideration." 
</P>
<P>
And not once, Kuehl said, did they look at it as a baseball ailment. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, he may have holes in his swing, but look at all the guys who have been 
successful in the major leagues who have holes in their swing," Kuehl said. "We 
did not think that was a factor in his disability." 
</P>
<P>
"Funny," Nelson said, "but I never even knew the A's knew about my dyslexia." 
</P>
<P>
He may have tipped them off when, while playing for double-A Huntsville (Ala.) 
in 1985, Nelson was asked to do a television commercial promoting the team. 
Unwilling to tell anybody of his problem, it took him 10 takes to read the cue 
cards before finally, in frustration, he jokingly shouted, "I'm dyslexic, so 
why don't you just write it backward?" 
</P>
<P>
He later memorized the lines and read them without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't go out of my way to do that kind of public speaking again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While he departed the A's thinking they never knew of his problem, he was aware 
early on that the Padres knew. Romenesko used to work with dyslexics as as high 
school teacher and mentioned some exercises to Nelson during contract 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a believer in eye muscle exercises for everybody," Romenesko said. "I 
don't think pro athletes can afford to waver one bit in any category, 
particularly the eyes. Again, we aren't treating him any different than we'd 
treat a guy with an injured toenail. This won't stop him from getting to the 
big leagues. " 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Padres showed their belief in Nelson this winter when they decided 
to keep him and traded their other top first base prospect, Brad Pounders. 
</P>
<P>
Said former tutor Spencer: "I can completely understand the Padres being 
cautious about an investment like Rob. But believe me, their worries are just 
not justified in his case." 
</P>
<P>
And Nelson continues to fight the label. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years ago at a winter league game in Pasadena, a scout noticed 
Nelson and announced, "Isn't that the boy with the speech problem? Did he ever 
get over that?" The same thing happened recently while Nelson was playing for 
triple-A Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"It is so totally unfair to bring this up after how hard he has worked to get 
here," David Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
While Rob Nelson doesn't read books these days -- and worries about what he's 
missing -- he did make an exception a couple of years ago. His hero had always 
been Steve Garvey, so he bought the book and set down to finish it. 
</P>
<P>
"And I did, I finished it," he said. "Took my wife four hours, took me five 
days, but yeah, I handled it." 
</P>
<P>
It is these little triumphs that keep him swinging, harder still, hoping not to 
end his career until he can hear people say, That Rob Nelson, he got all of it. 
</P>
<P>
Said Nelson: "If dyslexia had this much effect on me, I wouldn't be where I am, 
would I? There's a difference between a chance and a fair chance. All I want is 
a fair chance." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre Manager Jack McKeon didn't want Thursday's tie game to end, particularly 
since his team had come back from a 7-4 deficit after five innings. But the 
Indians claimed they were out of pitchers, which made McKeon wonder. "Here we 
are, the visiting team, and we have enough pitchers to go more innings, while 
the home team runs out?" he asked. "I guess it makes sense, the Indians only 
have, what, 30 pitchers in their camp? Just say this game ended against our 
will."

Question: Why were the 1988 Dodgers like a Sherlock Holmes movie or a vintage 
Charlie Chan or Agatha Christie whodunit? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Because the unlikeliest characters in the whole cast kept knocking off 
the poor victims. 
</P>
<P>
The butler did it. It got so it was like going to a bad Warner Bros. mystery 
flick. Keep your eye on the secretary. Even Colombo would have been baffled. 
</P>
<P>
Take the matter of the postseason games, the playoffs and World Series. 
Everybody knows about The Home Run, the Gibson-on-the-rocks against the Oakland 
A's in the World Series, and Kirk's 12th-inning job against the New York Mets 
in playoff game No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
But if Mike Scioscia hadn't hit a home run in the ninth inning of that game, 
there might have been no Dodger World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Scioscia? 
</P>
<P>
You heard me. Talk about the butler burying the knife in His Lordship's heart. 
</P>
<P>
Not even Scotland Yard would have figured on Mike Scioscia. Mike Scioscia was 
hitting his fourth home run of the year. (Gibson was hitting his 28th when he 
unloaded in the Series.) Mike Scioscia was hitting his 37th lifetime homer. 
(Gibson was to be hitting his 182nd). 
</P>
<P>
Scioscia might not have even been the butler. 
</P>
<P>
When he came to bat in the ninth inning of Game 4 of the playoffs, the Dodgers 
were trailing, 4-2. Dwight Gooden was on the mound. That's Dwight Gooden as in 
Cy Young winner, former rookie of the year, Dr. K. He owned the Dodgers. He was 
3-0 against them for the year, 8-1 lifetime. The Dodgers' earned-run average 
against him was 1.22. 
</P>
<P>
He had just walked John Shelby to start the ninth inning. So he wasn't going to 
fool around with Mike Scioscia. I mean, we weren't talking Kirk Gibson here. So 
he started him off with his best fastball. 
</P>
<P>
It ended up somewhere out in Queens. That was only the ninth home run Dwight 
Gooden had given up all year. It effectively put the Dodgers in the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
Had Scioscia popped that ball up -- or hit into a double play, it is more than 
possible, it is highly likely that the Dodgers would have been out of the 
Series picture, down 3-1 and fading. 
</P>
<P>
But Scioscia didn't pop it up. He popped it out. The most improbable home run 
of the season shocked Shea Stadium, to say nothing of Dwight Gooden, who 
reacted as if he had just been bitten by his own dog. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't shock the Dodgers, who had become accustomed to this kind of 
come-through performance from catcher Scioscia. 
</P>
<P>
If it had been a mystery, of course, the inspector would have said, "Don't 
anybody leave this room till we get to the bottom of this." But Mike Scioscia's 
fingerprints were on the murder weapon for a lot of Dodger victims over the 
years. Scioscia makes even the word dependable inadequate. He is as close to 
indispensable as any non-pitcher on the Los Angeles roster. 
</P>
<P>
No team wins the pennant without a solid, rock-steady performer behind the 
plate. First basemen, right fielders, even pitchers can be as temperamental as 
opera stars, unpredictable, egocentric. Catchers cannot. Catchers have to be 
like parish priests, country doctors. They're meant to keep the sanity, to 
soothe, counsel -- and, incidentally, throw out baserunners. 
</P>
<P>
They spend their lives on their knees. They catch a ball going 90 m.p.h., or 
curving or knuckling, 150 to 200 times a game. They sometimes have to calm down 
hysterical pitchers. They may have to position infielders. They have to be part 
psychiatrist, part parent. 
</P>
<P>
There is a man swinging a 33-ounce bludgeon only inches from their heads. They 
make their livings throwing out 9.3-second sprinters running on rubber tracks. 
They have 3.3 seconds to throw a ball 125 feet on a line to a target ankle-high 
on the first-base side of second. 
</P>
<P>
It's probably the most difficult job in baseball. No wonder they're not 
expected to hit home runs. 
</P>
<P>
They pay Mike Scioscia $1.1 million to call the pitches, dig bouncing curves 
out of the dirt, throw out Vince Coleman one out of three times, signal the 
pitcher when he sees a batter who can't possibly handle the outside curve. They 
don't expect him to homer off Dwight Gooden. He has other ways of putting the 
Dodgers in what Tommy Lasorda likes to refer to as the fall classic. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers didn't really club their way to the World Series championship, they 
kind of swarmed there like an angry hive of disturbed bees. 
</P>
<P>
And Scioscia wasn't the only hornet. They had Mickey Hatcher, who had hit only 
one home run all season, hitting two in the Series, and Mike Davis who had hit 
only two homers all season and driven in only 17 runs, hitting a homer and 
driving in two runs in the five-game Series alone. 
</P>
<P>
But a strong case could be made that none of these heroics would have been 
possible if Mike Scioscia had taken, swung and missed, or popped up that Gooden 
fastball on the night of Oct. 9. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the most shocked person in the park when it went out," he said the other 
day as he sat recalling the incident at Dodgertown. 
</P>
<P>
That may be so. But spectators recall Doc Gooden standing there as if he had 
just seen his own ghost. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to hit the ball hard somewhere, move John (Shelby) along," 
said Scioscia. 
</P>
<P>
As Gibson was to do later, he hit the ball almost standing on one leg. An 
inflamed Achilles tendon forced him to cut the heel out of his left shoe and 
wear a high-cut because it was the only way to keep the footwear from sliding 
off. 
</P>
<P>
"Even after I hit it, I wasn't thinking home run. I was just hoping it would 
hit off the wall because that was almost the only way I could be sure to get to 
first base." 
</P>
<P>
No one ever mixed Mike Scioscia up with Carl Lewis, even with heels in his 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, speed wasn't critical. Scioscia hit it where he could walk 
around the bases. 
</P>
<P>
As it also happened, Gibson's 12th-inning homer won that game. But not even 
Inspector Clouseau would accept that solution. As the Met fans streaming out of 
the park that night observed, "Scioscia killed us. Can you beat that?" 
</P>
<P>
It was the perfect crime. Nobody would believe it. They weren't even looking.

City officials want to boost the cost of parking for baseball fans at Anaheim 
Stadium by $1 to pay for lot repairs, but the Angels are balking, saying it may 
be pushing the cost of going to games too far by going from $3 to $4. 
</P>
<P>
The parking rate increase, if approved, would take effect March 31, city 
officials said, when the Angels play the Dodgers in the Freeway Series. The 
Angels, who have already increased most ticket prices by $1, may respond today 
to the proposal. The team would have to approve any parking changes made by 
Anaheim.

Charles Smith, Jaren Jackson, Bobby Winston and Johnathan Edwards say there is 
no special bond between them except that they are the only seniors on 
Georgetown's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyas Coach John Thompson sees it another way. 
</P>
<P>
"They were one of the reasons I would have been reluctant to take a leave of 
absence after the Olympics," said Thompson, who was offered an opportunity to 
do so after spending last spring and summer directing the U.S. national team. 
</P>
<P>
"More than any other group as a whole, they have fulfilled their academic 
obligation to this school. That lends itself toward my feeling a sense of 
obligation to them, and I felt extremely committed to them. They came to 
Georgetown to play basketball for me and they can't take a leave of absence 
from their senior year. This is their last time around and I wanted them to go 
out in style." 
</P>
<P>
So far, they have. The third-ranked Hoyas (23-4) won their first outright Big 
East Conference regular-season championship since 1983-84 and became the first 
team to clinch the Big East title before its final game. And Friday night, with 
a Big East tournament quarterfinal game, the four seniors will begin their last 
postseason journey -- one they hope will end in Seattle and the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
When this group of players came in, Edwards seemed the one destined for 
greatness. He was selected to the Parade high-school all-America team, and he 
was first-team all-Louisiana while Jackson was honorable mention. Winston, who 
played ahead of Smith while the two were at Washington's All Saints High 
School, was a first-team All-Met selection and set to go to Missouri until 
Thompson gave him the chance to go to Georgetown. Smith, an honorable mention 
All-Met, was passed over by Seton Hall in favor of Gerald Greene. He said he 
probably would have attended a small Division I or Division II school had 
Thompson not taken him. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably would have put myself at the bottom (compared to Edwards, Jackson 
and Winston)," said Smith, who entered Georgetown at 6 feet and 150 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it hasn't worked out that way. Smith started for the 1988 U.S. 
Olympic team and has become Georgetown's captain and its unquestioned team 
leader. This week he was named Big East player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"What Charles has accomplished speaks for itself," Thompson said. "This kid is 
basically the man on the team and he's done that through hard work and 
determination." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he believes Smith's NBA prospects are bright. But if a pro career 
does not develop, Smith says he will be ready and is hoping to enter the 
movie-production business. 
</P>
<P>
"Basketball wasn't the only thing I was in school for," he said. "I was here 
for an education. I'm going to have something to fall back on." 
</P>
<P>
For Edwards, a 6-9, 240-pound forward, the need to have something on which he 
could fall back developed earlier than he would have liked. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman, he played in all 32 games and led his classmates with averages 
of 4.1 points, 3.5 rebounds and nearly 14 minutes. He also was named to the Big 
East's all-freshman team. 
</P>
<P>
But early in his sophomore year, he injured his back and missed 12 of the 
Hoyas' first 14 games. He has been playing catch-up ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been difficult sometimes," said Edwards, who plans to pursue an MBA. "I 
think about high school, when I was the center of attention. ... But I also 
think about how people's reactions to me changed when I wasn't in the 
limelight. That brought me back down to earth. I learned right away that this 
only lasts for a little bit. ... " 
</P>
<P>
"He's handled his situation very well," Thompson said. " ... He didn't sit 
around and pout, and he didn't say, 'I'm a senior and I should be playing.' He 
just kept working hard." 
</P>
<P>
Winston, a 6-5 guard, also has continued to work hard this season despite 
averaging only 14 minutes in Georgetown's first 22 games. As a result, when 
Thompson increased his playing time in Game 23, at Boston College, Winston was 
ready. He tied his career best with 13 points, grabbed six rebounds and handed 
out two assists. In the four games since, he has averaged 28 minutes per game 
and performed the way Thompson expected. 
</P>
<P>
Winston said that playing for Thompson has been about so much more than just 
playing ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned a lot of things under Coach Thompson that really have nothing to 
do with basketball," said Winston, who is planning on a business career after 
he graduates. "That's what I've appreciated most about coming to Georgetown." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who is interested in computer science, agreed with Winston. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that every college basketball player can't be under Coach 
Thompson," he said.

DAVISON'S CLUTCH HITS PUT REDONDO IN TOURNEY FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS KAISER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Redondo High infielder Brian Davison was a two-time hero Thursday, delivering 
key hits to propel the Sea Hawks to a 5-4 victory over Burbank Bell-Jeff in a 
semifinal game of the Crossroads/Westside baseball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Davison delivered a one-out, bases-loaded triple in the top of the seventh to 
bring the Sea Hawks back from a 4-1 deficit to tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
He was not through. Two innings later, Davison again singled, scoring Ron 
Brooks from second base with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo, 3-1, advances to the final of the 32-team tournament Saturday against 
the winner of the Channel Islands-Venice game. 
</P>
<P>
"When you put a winner in there like Davison, (and) when you have a chance to 
win a game, this is what happens," Redondo Coach Tim Ammentorp said. Davison 
was 4 for 5 at the plate with 4 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Hawks got a stellar pitching performance from sophomore right-hander 
Mike Houck, who now has a 2-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
In his second outing this season, Houck was at his best in the three middle 
innings, where he faced the minimum of nine batters and threw just 18 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Davison's late-inning heroics would have been unnecessary but for two 
disastrous innings in which the Sea Hawk infield committed four errors. Houck 
surrendered just one earned run, but trailed 4-0 after the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out like we had been riding in a bus for an hour and a half," 
Ammentorp said of his team's early play. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't ready to play when we got here." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Davison woke up. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in a slump at the start of the season, but I pulled myself out of it 
today," he said. "I got all the pitches I wanted today."

LIONS EXPECTED TO STAY IN WEST FOR NCAA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where will Loyola Marymount be playing in a week? Thanks to its victory in the 
West Coast Athletic Conference tournament, chances are the Lions will remain in 
the West as the WCAC's official representative in the NCAA regionals. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions could be sent to any of eight opening-round sites but will probably 
stay in the West, either at the University of Arizona (Tucson) or Boise State 
in Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
Where that leaves regular-season champ St. Mary's is anybody's guess, although 
it will probably be outside the West and a low seed. 
</P>
<P>
For St. Mary's, it was bad luck to lose in the WCAC semifinals, with a key 
player hurt and on the bench during the tournament. From the WCAC's standpoint, 
however, it may have been a stroke of luck. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a weak non-conference schedule, St. Mary's outstanding record, 25-4, 
and rank as No. 2 defensive team statistically in the NCAA should assure the 
Gaels a spot somewhere in the field of 64. Regional sites outside the West are 
Atlanta, Dallas, Indianapolis, Greensboro, N.C., Nashville, Tenn. and 
Providence, R.I. Seedings and match-ups will be announced Sunday. First-round 
games are Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Santa Clara's upset of St. Mary's in the WCAC tournament, the 
conference has high hopes of placing four teams in postseason tournaments. That 
would be a high-water mark for the WCAC, which receives little recognition 
nationally but is seen as an up-and-comer by those who closely observe college 
basketball. Using a formula of team records and non-conference play, WCAC 
officials were crowing that the conference ranks in the top 12 out of about 40 
on the Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara, 20-10, has high hopes of being selected for the National 
Invitation Tournament for the second straight year, as does Pepperdine (19-12). 
If the Waves were to win a game in the NIT, they would join St. Mary's, Loyola 
(20-10) and Santa Clara as 20-game winners, which would be another conference 
record. This is only the second time in WCAC history that three teams have won 
20 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing last year's sentiment, Loyola players and coaches said they don't care 
where they go to open the NCAA tournament. "Like I said last year, I don't care 
where we go, we're just happy to be in and still playing," Lions star Hank 
Gathers said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the Lions made a good impression in Salt Lake City, winning a wild 
119-115 opener over a highly regarded Wyoming team before falling to North 
Carolina. This year they figure to be a relatively low seed. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's Coach Lynn Nance said he believed his team would be selected even if 
it didn't win the WCAC tournament. He was so sure that he held out his best 
player, Erick Newman, who was nursing a twisted knee. "I wasn't going to risk 
his health. I've got to think about the NCAA Tournament," Nance said. "We're 
25-4. I hope (the NCAA) shows us some respect, put us in there somewhere with a 
decent draw. I can't believe anybody would overlook (the Gaels), ranked where 
we are." 
</P>
<P>
It would be surprising if the Gaels are overlooked, but Nance may be overly 
optimistic about the draw. Since the Gaels would be an at-large selection -- 
instead of conference champ -- they would probably be seeded in the bottom 
third of the regional and draw a strong opponent. Their style of play, however, 
will probably allow the Gaels to keep most opponents close. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara should have a good shot at the NIT after its strong showing in the 
WCAC tournament and a solid non-conference record. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine probably plays the toughest non-conference schedule, but Waves Coach 
Tom Asbury sounded more hopeful than optimistic about chances of an invitation. 
The Waves went to the NIT last year with only 17 victories. "I think we played 
well enough that we should have the opportunity," he said. "I'm not gonna say 
we're an odds-on bet to get in." 
</P>
<P>
College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's Hank Gathers continues to lead the NCAA in scoring (32.9) and 
rebounding (13.6) by comfortable margins. He needs 13 points to become the 12th 
Division I player to get 1,000 in a season . . . Loyola continues to score at a 
record pace, averaging 112.8 per game. The collegiate record of 110.5 was set 
by Nevada-Las Vegas in 1975-76 . . . UCLA assistant basketball Coach Paul 
Landreaux, who won several community college state titles at El Camino College, 
has reportedly withdrawn his name from consideration for the Cal State 
Fullerton head coaching job . . . Loyola baseball standout Miah Bradbury has 
been named a first-team All-American in Sport magazine's season preview.

NORTHRIDGE'S SCHNARE 4 FOR 4 IN HER SPECIALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If ever a Division II swimmer has earned the right to wade with a bit of a 
swagger, it would be breaststroke specialist Tina Schnare of Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
By winning the 100-yard breaststroke in a time of 1:04.83 on Thursday, Schnare 
became the first four-time winner of a single event in the eight-year history 
of the women's portion of the NCAA Division II national finals. 
</P>
<P>
"I was relieved, " said Schnare, who made an animated swipe at the sweat over 
her brow at the conclusion of the race. 
</P>
<P>
A mediocre third leg Thursday kept Schnare from bettering her Division II 
record of 1:04.76, set as a freshman in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a little slow on that third leg, but she killed them on that last 
lap," CSUN Coach Pete Accardy said. Colleen Criscillo of Army was a distant 
second in 1:06.13. 
</P>
<P>
Three years after an auspicious national debut in which she shattered two 
individual records and contributed to a pair of record-setting relay teams, 
Schnare is only slightly less awed by her competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry about everything," she said between chomps on her glossy pink 
fingernails before Thursday night's race. "It's hard when you're the one 
everyone else is trying to beat." 
</P>
<P>
Schnare has won more first-place medals than any Division II women's swimmer in 
history, mixing six relay championships with seven individual titles. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Marie Wycoff, an Army senior who already has won the 200-yard individual 
medley and 200-yard butterfly in this meet, has matched Schnare's individual 
total. Wycoff has never been on a winning relay team, however. 
</P>
<P>
"You would think," Accardy said, "that with all Tina has accomplished, with 
what she's won, she'd be acting like she owns these races by now. But that's 
not her. She still lacks confidence. Emotionally, she's a yo-yo." 
</P>
<P>
Question Schnare about a future race and her response inevitably begins with 
the phrase, "I hope . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Swagger? Schnare doesn't even talk a boastful game. 
</P>
<P>
She said she wasn't aware she had become the first woman to post four 
consecutive victories. "Really? That's nice," she said when informed. 
</P>
<P>
It is not false modesty; Schnare is truly shy. Perhaps part of her reluctance 
to brag stems from having little to brag about before coming to Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
She was successful enough -- winning three league breaststroke titles while at 
Mira Costa High in Manhattan Beach -- but her times were not that impressive. 
</P>
<P>
"I never imagined winning nationals even once," Schnare said. "I used to go to 
junior national meets at AAU and I was nothing there." 
</P>
<P>
Before joining CSUN's team, Schnare had never bettered 1:07 in the 100-yard 
breaststroke. Before her first Division II championship meet, she had improved 
to just 1:06.4. 
</P>
<P>
Accardy recalls spending much of Schnare's first season trying to convince her 
that she had talent. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her she had the potential to go 1:05," Accardy said. 
</P>
<P>
Her response? "I said, 'Uh-uh, no way,' " Schnare recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, Accardy admits, she was right. She did even better. 
</P>
<P>
"She also told me that she wasn't a good finals swimmer," Accardy said. "I 
said, 'Baloney. There's no reason for that. I don't even want to hear it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Of course, as she has since proven, nothing could be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Schnare will try for her fourth consecutive championship in the 
200-yard breaststroke. Again, she will be chasing a mark -- 2:19.78 -- she 
holds, which is all the more for her to fret about. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd really like to break that record," Schnare said. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the record doesn't fall, and even if her winning streak does, 
Schnare will walk away from her last meet with few regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"Four years is a long time," Schnare said. "I think I'm ready to quit, even 
though it's been fun." 
</P>
<P>
But she will miss the people, Schnare said, especially Accardy, who offered her 
a tuition scholarship without ever seeing her swim. 
</P>
<P>
"I owe a lot to Pete," Schnare said. "He taught me a lot. I'm a better person 
because of some of the things I've learned." 
</P>
<P>
Such as? 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Schnare said softly, "I'm not as shy . . . and I have a lot more 
confidence."

VENTURA'S ESPITIA SHUTS DOWN VALLEY AGAIN, 3-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Shane Espitia of Ventura College has a secret -- one he isn't willing to share 
with the rest of the area's junior college pitchers. He appears to be the only 
one who knows how to beat Valley College, a trick he performed for the second 
time this season with a three-hit, 3-0 victory Thursday in a Western State 
Conference game at Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to pitch well to shut out a team like us," Valley Coach Chris Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Valley (14-2-1, 2-1 in WSC play), has suffered its only losses against Espitia, 
a freshman right-hander -- the first occurred two weeks ago, a 5-4 setback in 
the semifinals of the San Bernardino tournament eventually won by Valley. And 
Espitia recently mastered a new pitch, a cut fastball that moves toward 
right-handers, to complement his slider, which breaks in the opposite 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hitting my spots with my fastball and my slider," Espitia said. "If I 
can't control both pitches, I would have had a tougher time. That whole team 
can hit." 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday, Espitia (3-1) kept Valley guessing. He struck out five and walked 
four for his second complete game. Only one Valley runner reached third base 
and the Monarchs hit into three double plays. 
</P>
<P>
The most costly double play took place in the sixth inning. After Ray Sabado 
led off with a single to right to extend his hitting streak to 15 games, Gene 
Demyon walked. But Mark Cavaretta put the brakes to the rally with a grounder 
to first that was turned into a double play. Sabado advanced to third but was 
left there when Greg Struhl grounded to second. 
</P>
<P>
Valley starter Joey Kane (3-2) pitched well enough to win, scattering eight 
hits, striking out six and walking three. But he gave up run-scoring doubles to 
David Eggert and Mike Spencer in the second inning and an RBI single to Mike 
Teron in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura is 10-4, 2-2 in the WSC.

SECURITY PACIFIC EXTENDS HOURS ON MONDAYS, FRIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The war among California's big banks for consumer business heated up Thursday 
when Security Pacific National Bank said it will extend its hours to 7 p.m. on 
Mondays and Fridays at its 552 branches around the state. 
</P>
<P>
The move by the state's second-largest bank follows Wells Fargo's decision last 
month to keep all of its branches open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. every weeknight. 
It creates pressure on other banks, particularly Bank of America and First 
Interstate, to consider the expensive step of extending their hours. 
</P>
<P>
The tradition of bank offices being open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., the so-called 
banker's hours, has been vanishing across the country in recent years as banks 
compete for customers by offering more convenient hours. 
</P>
<P>
But the battle is hotter in California than elsewhere, in part because of the 
huge branch networks operated by the four big banks and because interest rates 
on consumer deposits and loans tend to be relatively uniform here. 
</P>
<P>
"Banks have chosen in California to compete on image and convenience," said 
Frank J. Diekmann, editor of Bank Advertising News, which monitors industry 
marketing and advertising trends. 
</P>
<P>
For customers, the results are longer branch hours, more automated teller 
machines and such innovations as 24-hour telephone service to answer questions 
about the status of their personal checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that banker's hours really don't make a whole lot of sense in 
today's world," said Jack Kopec, head of consumer services for San 
Francisco-based Wells Fargo, the state's third-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly in a world of two-income families, people have difficulty using 
branches during traditional hours. Many California banks have responded by 
extending hours at selective branches for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a Bank of America branch in Hercules in Contra Costa County is 
open from noon to 8 p.m. on weekdays, and some banks open some branches on 
Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo touched off the latest escalation in the battle last month with the 
announcement that all 455 of its branches would be open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Wells Fargo's across-the-board approach represented a real departure," said 
Larry Boggs, spokesman for Union Bank, the state's fifth-largest bank. Union's 
167 branches generally are open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., but Boggs said the bank 
is considering extended hours. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Monday, Los Angeles-based Security Pacific National Bank will keep 
all of its branches open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Mondays and Fridays. The 
9-to-4 schedule adopted in 1987 remains in effect Tuesdays through Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
"Our customers have indicated that they would like us to be available later on 
Monday and Friday," said Jerry A. Grundhofer, head of the bank's consumer 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey M. Radin, a spokesman for Bank of America, said the state's largest bank 
is not considering a blanket extension of hours. He said decisions on hours 
will continue to be made by local managers of its 851 branches, based on 
community needs. 
</P>
<P>
Some of First Interstate Bank's 318 branches have extended hours. Ken Preston, 
a First Interstate spokesman, said there are no plans for a broad change in the 
normal hours of 10 to 4. But he said California's fourth-largest bank will 
"monitor the competition and our customers." 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1988, Wells Fargo introduced its innovative 24-hour telephone 
service for checking account customers. Bank of America and Security Pacific 
followed with their own versions of the 24-hour service. 
</P>
<P>
An executive at one big bank, who asked that his name not be used, Thursday 
bemoaned the latest move to longer hours, fearing that something akin to a gas 
station war will break out. 
</P>
<P>
"Our marketing studies don't show a real need for these hours, and they are 
going to drive up costs," the executive said.

S. J. DIAMOND: THE REAL NEWS AT SEARS IS ITS BID TO CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Sears announced that it was cutting prices across the board, the nation's 
press hailed it as a revolution in retailing. Then the day came and the signs 
went up saying: "We have the brands you want at great low prices every single 
day!" and crowds of customers raced to Sears as to a one-day fire sale. 
</P>
<P>
But what kind of a revolution is it when other retailers have had low prices 
every day for years, building empires by discounting national brands? And what 
are these low prices, and how long will they last? "I'd guess they're lowering 
prices to try to save themselves," says Los Angeles resident Dorothy Clark. 
"They've probably been at a competitive disadvantage: there's Target, and Toys 
R Us, and even Saks always has a sale. The question is, are their prices now 
worth my going there? For a long time they weren't." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Sears' very effort to change is news: At $30 billion in annual sales, 
the nation's largest retailer still has girth, if not shine. And what it's 
doing may ultimately be revolutionary -- not because of Sears' rather tardy 
insight that "everyday low prices" are less costly to a retailer than constant 
sales promotions, but because some of the other things Sears is doing in an 
effort to save itself may give the marketplace some new shine. 
</P>
<P>
Sears has announced changes before, of course. For two decades the big chain 
has struggled to find its "franchise" in a new era of discounting, of clean, 
well-lit, socially acceptable K marts, Targets, Marshalls and Toys R Us, 
selling not junk but nationally advertised brands. Above Sears was a "glass 
ceiling" of upscale merchandising -- department stores, with fashion goods and 
affluent shoppers. Below was discounting, which Sears couldn't match, given the 
overhead of its big mall stores, service personnel, distribution centers, 
catalogue operations and expensive Chicago headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost Market Share 
</P>
<P>
Over 10 years, Sears has tried some deeper discounting, some higher fashion (a 
Cheryl Tiegs sportswear line). It introduced a "store of the future," with 
contemporary layout and graphics like other stores of the present. It clung to 
its traditions -- private labels, exclusive models of national brands, 
promotional sales of the week. 
</P>
<P>
And it kept losing its share of the retail market, which had "moved to another 
plateau," says Walter Loeb, senior retail analyst at Morgan Stanley in New 
York. For Sears, he says, "this is a fight for survival." 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy to test the validity of Sears' revolution in pricing (even 
granting that low prices are revolutionary only to Sears). Comparison shopping 
its prices leads to several pitfalls. For one thing, at this point, Sears may 
have blacked out its old prices on some items but provided no new prices on the 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
For another, many of Sears' goods may be comparable to goods elsewhere but 
impossible to compare. Some departments have only private labels: One cannot 
compare Sears-brand linen prices with another store's Fieldcrest, Cannon, 
Wamsutta. Similarly, one can't compare toaster oven prices when Sears stocks 
only Sears brand and everyone else carries Black &amp; Decker. 
</P>
<P>
More confusing, Sears has exclusive models of many nationally branded items, 
with unique model numbers and slightly different features. Sears' Black &amp; 
Decker Automatic Shut-Off Electronic Iron F440WHD is $44.74 (old price $59.99), 
but it's found only at Sears. The closest comparison elsewhere is model 
F440WHS, priced between $40 and $50, and, says the manufacturer, slightly 
different. How does one compare Sears' exclusive model 1570SR of Century's 
Kanga-Rocka-Roo baby carrier at $27.46: Is its proper counterpart the widely 
available model with tray? With storage pouch? In fabric or vinyl? 
</P>
<P>
When direct comparisons are possible, Sears wins some and loses some. A 
Fisher-Price nursery monitor is $42.96, compared to $44.84 at Toys R Us. An 
AT&amp;T Trimline 210 phone is $29.84, infinitesimally lower than the $29.90 at 
Adray's, one of L.A.'s most competitive discounters, but a Black &amp; Decker 
under-cabinet can opener is $13.94, compared to Adray's $9.90. Braun's 
Citromatic 2 juicer is $17.96 at Sears and $20 at the Broadway stores, but the 
Levi's 501 Student Fit blue jean is $20.94 at Sears, compared to $19.95 plus 
25% off at the Broadway. (More fascinating is the vision of Sears' old prices: 
the Citromatic 2, for example, was $24.99 -- $5 more than at the Broadway.) 
</P>
<P>
The validity of Sears' revolution in retailing is another matter, so far widely 
misunderstood. Sears' endorsement of the principle that everyday low prices are 
more cost-efficient than constant sales promotions is news, but not a 
revolution. A revolution would be the success of the overall program -- both 
sales boosting and cost cutting -- of which the new pricing is only a part. 
</P>
<P>
Sears has already closed three of its 13 regional distribution centers and will 
have only six by mid-1990. Catalogue sales will become a separate organization; 
its unit inventory cut by up to 25%. Sears' headquarters building in Chicago is 
for sale, and its merchandise group employees -- already 400 fewer since last 
year -- will be moved. 
</P>
<P>
To build traffic, Sears is also introducing "power formats" (Loeb's translation 
of "power" marketing: "If you walk into a store, you really feel like shopping 
there") in the guise of "superstores within a store." The first were "Brand 
Centrals" -- collections of appliances and home electronics that have already 
been deemed a success. This week Sears introduced its first "Kids &amp; More" 
-- a children's department featuring clothes, shoes, toys, furniture (both 
Sears labels and national brands such as Oshkosh, Levi, Bugle Boy, Hush 
Puppies, Reebok), even maternity clothes, a haircut salon and play areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impossible to Evaluate 
</P>
<P>
These "superstore" formats -- applicable in the future to tires, paint and 
hardware, men's or women's apparel, says retail analyst John Landschulz at 
Cowen &amp; Co. in Chicago -- could eventually give Sears some escape from its 
expensive mall locations. If a region or neighborhood could use a "Kids &amp; 
More" or a "Brand Central," but not a full Sears, it could be introduced 
economically as an independent store on a street or mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
But those are future developments, revolutionary in concept but impossible to 
evaluate. The new pricing, selection of goods and presentation are open to 
review. So is Sears' promise that salespeople who would otherwise be changing 
sale signs and re-marking goods will now be freed to provide more customer 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Now that would be news, and downright revolutionary.

Gosh, this was once a great place to work! Ed Bischoff was saying it, and Ed 
Bischoff would know. Twenty-two years with Eastern Airlines. The Wings of Man, 
they called it. And that's just what it was.

"The company feeling was, you did the job right, you did it quick, you did it 
together," the stock clerk said. "Camaraderie is what we had. Unshakeable 
thing, that camaraderie. I'll miss that."

<P>
Of course, the good old days are now good and gone. And Thursday was no time to 
get sentimental about them, not at union headquarters anyway. Workers still had 
picketing to do. They reached for signs and zipped up their jackets.

But for the older ones this was more than a fork in the road; this might be the 
end. Eastern -- in its 60th year -- actually had filed for bankruptcy. The 
Wings of Man were grounded, maybe for good. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Bischoff is nearly 60 himself. There was a full head of hair under his cap 
when he started, and no stretch to his waist. "I see guys here I've been having 
coffee with for 20 years," he said. "Now, who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
Cyril Skinner, his old pal, grabbed Ed's elbow. "Maybe we should declare 
bankruptcy, too," he joked. "We ain't got no money either." 
</P>
<P>
"We ain't got money for lawyers, and lawyers is what it takes," Ed said. 
"Lawyers, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
They trolled for memories. Younger fellows don't know that it used to be 
different. Sure, labor and mangement sometimes had arguments then, but both 
sides were in the aviation business. These days, it seems the guys at the top 
are more interested in juggling assets than flying passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank Lorenzo bought the company (in 1986) just so he could sell it off, piece 
by piece," said Earl Davis, who cleans airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
That is the union's view: that Lorenzo, Eastern's chairman, has been treating 
the airline like a derelict at a blood bank, converting its essence into cash. 
</P>
<P>
Workers hate him. "He has no concern for people," said Rene Devilliers, 59, 
crew leader at a machine shop, 21 years on the job. "When he shaves in the 
morning, he must close his eyes." 
</P>
<P>
To many old-timers, the signs were clear. Lorenzo had long been steering the 
company toward bankruptcy. A machinists' strike merely hastened the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"The past two years, you couldn't do your job," Devilliers said. "Parts were 
always out of stock. It was like there was a master plan to debilitate the 
airline until nothing was left." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Blakey, stock clerk, started at Eastern right out of high school, 36 years 
ago. He remembers when Eddie Rickenbacker, the World War I flying ace, ran the 
company. "He was hardball, but he listened," Blakey said. 
</P>
<P>
There was tradition. This was a pioneer company, born in the days when men in 
leather helmets were trying to prove air travel reliable enough to carry the 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, Eastern cornered the market in the New York-Atlanta-Miami 
triangle, then sprawled in all directions to Texas, Mexico, Puerto Rico and 
Canada. It became Miami's largest corporate employer. 
</P>
<P>
"This was known as the pilot's airline," said Dick Thompson, 23 years in the 
cockpit. "When I started here, Eastern had the great jet fleet. Delta was just 
a marginal carrier back then." 
</P>
<P>
Hard times came to stay under the leadership of Frank Borman, the former 
astronaut who took over Eastern in 1975. In the early 1980s, he had to struggle 
with an industry down-draft in the newly deregulated skies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Told You So' 
</P>
<P>
Borman fought ferocious battles with labor while trying to cut costs, then sold 
Eastern to Lorenzo, who already had a reputation as a union buster. 
</P>
<P>
"From then on, we were in the hands of a corporate raider, and there was 
nothing ahead but the selling of assets and then bankruptcy," Thompson said. 
"We all knew that." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, "You just wait and see" became "I told you so." That the 
bankruptcy petition was hastened -- the airline would say caused -- by a strike 
did not bother most workers. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it looks like we're keeping the house warm by burning the furniture, 
but it's personal," Devilliers said. "We can't work for Lorenzo any more." 
</P>
<P>
That means Devilliers is giving up $18.83 an hour, at least under the old 
contract. "I'd rather work for half the money with somebody else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But even lower-paying jobs will not be easy to find, especially for the older 
workers. Jack Blakey, 52, has already looked around. "They think I'm too old," 
he said. "They don't tell you that, but that's what it is." 
</P>
<P>
Pilot Les Welsh, 56, said, "If there's some way everyone gets their job back, 
I'll go back and work hard as ever. Otherwise, I'd be forced to retire. 
</P>
<P>
"At my age, I'd never get on with another line. I'll just pick up my pension 
and fade into the sunset."

Levi Strauss Associates Inc.: The San Francisco-based clothing company reported 
net income in 1988 of $111.9 million, down 17% from last year, on sales of $3.1 
billion, up 7%. The company blamed the results on increased advertising 
expenses, costs associated with reorganization of domestic operations and a 
higher effective tax rate. This is the first time the company has disclosed 
financial results since it went private in 1985.

K mart Corp., the nation's No. 2 retailer, said Thursday that its sales and 
profit hit record levels in the fiscal year ended Jan. 25, as new merchandising 
strategies and strong showings by specialty stores boosted earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The retailer said fourth-quarter profit surged 22% to $393.2 million from 
$321.4 million, as sales rose to 8.5% to $8.42 billion. 
</P>
<P>
For the year as a whole, profit rose 16% to $802.9 million and sales gained 
6.5% to $27.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The giant retailer, which ranks second in U.S. sales to Sears, Roebuck &amp; 
Co., has sought in recent years to shed its discounter image and has upgraded 
its stores and goods to appeal to higher-income consumers as well as its 
traditional base.

REGULATORS SEIZE CONTROL OF 45 MORE TROUBLED S&amp;LS 
</P>

<P>
Federal regulators Thursday seized control of 45 more savings and loan 
associations in eight states, including 21 in Texas alone, in another step 
toward bringing insolvent thrifts under federal control to minimize financial 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's move by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. brings the total under 
the agency's control to 118 thrifts in 24 states. The latest failed thrifts to 
be taken over had assets totaling $13.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Bush Administration announced Thursday that it 
opposes federal regulators' practice of offering tax breaks to attract buyers 
for insolvent savings and loan institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators used tax incentives in the sale of 75 institutions late last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Unequivocally, we do not favor the continuation of favorable tax treatment," 
White House Budget Director Richard G. Darman told the Senate Finance 
Committee. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board has estimated the tax revenue 
losses from those sales at $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional leaders have also spoken out against continuing the tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, in one of the earliest acts of his Administration, ordered 
seizure of insolvent S&amp;Ls because the insurance fund that guarantees 
deposits of up to $100,000 is far short of the cash needed to close down 
institutions crippled by bad loans and mismanagement during the economic 
upheavals of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The regulators, upon taking over the additional 45 thrifts, will take steps to 
prevent further financial hemorrhaging with the object of holding down the 
eventual cost of guaranteeing the deposits. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC, which under a Bush proposal is to become the agency responsible for 
surviving S&amp;Ls as well as for the nation's banks, has sought to reassure 
depositors that the thrift institutions the agency takes over will remain open 
as usual and that all deposit accounts up to $100,000 will remain fully 
protected by federal deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the 21 Texas S&amp;Ls seized Thursday, there were nine in Colorado, 
four in Tennessee, three each in New Mexico and Pennsylvania, two each in 
Alabama and Georgia and one in Michigan.

CONGRESS CONSIDERS TIGHTER RULES ON FUTURES TRADING

Congress is considering far-reaching proposals to shore up public confidence in 
U.S. future markets, rocked by allegations of cheating, the chairman of the 
Senate Agriculture Committee said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals include adding muscle to the federal agency that monitors futures 
exchanges, curbing some trade practices and requiring markets to track trading 
activity more closely. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont told Wendy L. Gramm, chairman of the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates futures markets, that he 
wants the agency to analyze the proposals within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Futures exchanges have been under fire since it was disclosed in January that 
the FBI led a two-year undercover probe into alleged illegal trading at the 
Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy's committee is responsible for drafting legislation to renew the CFTC's 
authority to operate. The agency's powers are to expire later this year. The 
senator said he would hold up the CFTC bill until he learns more about the FBI 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy told Gramm at a committee hearing that the reform proposals include 
requiring the futures exchanges to keep closer track of trades. Currently, 
trades must be timed to the nearest minute, but some critics have said the 
one-minute time frame gives traders a window of opportunity to cheat. 
</P>
<P>
The senator said his panel was considering giving the CFTC the power to fine a 
broker up to three times the amount of any monetary gain resulting from an 
illegal trade. 
</P>
<P>
Gramm was also asked to consider whether "dual trading," which allows brokers 
to trade for both their own and others' accounts, should be curtailed.

The market rose Wednesday amid hopes that the employment statistics for 
February would show a slowing of economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Such a development could be read as a positive portent for the inflation 
outlook and a possible easing of upward pressure on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the figures come in with an unpleasant surprise, analysts said, the 
market could suffer a letdown. 
</P>
<P>
Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose 1/2 to 113 1/8, General 
Electric gained 1/8 to 45 1/2, International Business Machines dropped 1 to 118 
3/8 and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was unchanged at 30 1/2.

<P>
Upjohn was the volume leader, down 2 1/4 at 29 3/8. Responding to an analyst's 
report, the company said it was too soon to gauge the effect of new 
prescription procedures in New York State on sales of two Upjohn tranquilizers.

CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
The dollar drifted lower against other major currencies in dull U.S. trading as 
dealers marked time before the release of February's unemployment report. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices rose in domestic dealing after declining overseas. Republic 
National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $393.80 an ounce, up $1.90 from 
Wednesday's late bid. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's waiting for the unemployment report," said Fred Barth, chief 
foreign exchange trader for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "Trading was 
lackluster at best." 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers elsewhere around the world reported that activity slackened as 
market operators awaited release of the U.S. unemployment report by the Labor 
Department in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar moved moderately higher against several key currencies in some 
overseas foreign exchange markets before reversing course in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.23 Japanese yen, up from 128.73. 
</P>
<P>
Later in London, the dollar traded at 129.10 yen. The decline continued in U.S. 
trading, and the dollar was quoted late in New York at 128.80 yen, down from 
129.225 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7183 late Thursday from Wednesday's 
$1.7200. Sterling strengthened in U.S. trading, rising to $1.7220 from $1.7155 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold bullion prices rose in U.S. trading but fell on foreign metal markets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices edged lower in quiet trading, also affected by anticipation of the 
release of February employment figures. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 5/32 point, or more than $1.50 per 
$1,000 face amount, while its yield crept up to 9.06% from 9.05% late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Nathan, senior financial economist with Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in San 
Francisco, said the market expected weak job growth last month, with 250,000 
new jobs added. A figure above the consensus likely would send bond prices 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
ranged between 1/16 point and 5/32 point lower, intermediate maturities lost 
5/32 point and long-term issues fell 1/8 point, according to Telerate Inc., a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, slipped 1.17 to 1,124.14. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate bonds moved higher. Moody's investment grade corporate bond index, 
which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five 
years or longer, rose 0.18 to 298.92. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9.8125%, down from 10.50% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Silver futures prices surged in the final minutes of trading on New York's 
Commodity Exchange and settled with the spot-delivery price above $6 an ounce 
for the first time in nearly six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, gold futures also advanced, grains and soybeans rebounded 
sharply, livestock and meat futures were lower and energy futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
Silver settled 14.1 to 15.3 cents higher, with the most actively traded 
contract, for delivery in May, at $6.09 an ounce. The spot contract for March 
delivery settled at the day's high of $6.008 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Gold settled $1.40 to $1.90 higher with April at $397.30 a troy ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the rally was technically inspired, meaning the buying was based 
on bullish interpretations of chart patterns rather than on any change in 
market fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
But the strength of silver relative to gold also suggests that speculators and 
investors are embracing silver and turning away from gold, the traditional 
leader of the precious metals group. 
</P>
<P>
"The white knight is finally performing," said Peter Cardillo, commodity 
trading adviser with Josephthal &amp; Co., a New York futures brokerage firm. 
"I think we're going to see silver emerge as the leader in the next major 
rally." 
</P>
<P>
Gold is often perceived as a safe haven for investment dollars in inflationary 
times, but it has responded poorly to recent government reports of sharp rises 
in wholesale and consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
Gold's sluggish reaction to the inflation signals "suggests to some traders 
that silver may outperform gold," said analyst Bette Raptopoulos of 
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
She said the rally also reflected positioning by traders before today's 
unemployment report. 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean futures advanced strongly on the Chicago Board of Trade, 
erasing most of the previous session's losses amid a variety of bullish 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasts for continued dryness in prime winter wheat areas supported the wheat 
market, as did talk that the Soviet Union was seeking to buy more U.S. wheat at 
subsidized prices. 
</P>
<P>
Corn futures were boosted by higher cash prices and by concerns about a lack of 
adequate soil moisture in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Sluggish cash markets pressured livestock and meat futures on the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange. Heavy marketings of hogs also weighed on the pork complex. 
</P>
<P>
Energy futures retreated in technically motivated trading on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange, reversing the previous session's sharp gains in heating 
oil.

EMHART TURNS DOWN $2.4-BILLION BID

Emhart Corp.'s board of directors rejected an investment group's unsolicited 
$2.4-billion takeover offer Thursday. The company also said it had received 
rival buyout bids from other parties. 
</P>
<P>
Peter L. Scott, Emhart's chairman and chief executive, recommended shareholders 
not tender any of their stock to Topper Acquisition Corp. and raised questions 
about unusual movements in Emhart's stock price before the group's bid. 
</P>
<P>
"This trading raises disquieting questions as to whether the government's 
actions aimed at curbing insider trading on non-public information have been 
effective," Scott said in a letter to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Topper, whose investors include oil heir Gordon P. Getty and New York 
developers Lawrence and Zachary Fisher, offered $35 a share for Emhart on Feb. 
24. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Topper, who asked that his name not be used, said the 
investment group would have no immediate comment on Emhart's action or the 
allegations of insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
Emhart stock rose 37.50 cents to $42.3750 a share Thursday in New York Stock 
Exchange trading.

EXPO SHOWS A NEW WAVE OF ACTIVEWEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEIL FEINEMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although most people have never heard of it, the Action Sports Retailer Trade 
Expo is the world's best indoor beach party. Twice each year for three days, 
surf, beach volleyball, skateboarding, rollerskating and windsailing stars, 
manufacturers and retailers pack the Long Beach Convention Center, preview the 
upcoming season's wares and generally have a fine old time. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, retail activist Peter Glen's opening seminar undercut the 
party atmosphere. In it, he warned the industry of the dangers of complacency 
and a failure to assume social responsibility in the face of environmental 
destruction, AIDS, homelessness and corporate takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
Even the success of the industry poses a problem, he said. Surf shops are now 
fixtures throughout the Midwest, Japan and Europe. New York department stores, 
such as Macy's, have profitable beach boutiques, and mainstream trade 
magazines, such as Women's Wear Daily, photograph neon activewear. 
</P>
<P>
These big boys have so much money, Glen continued, that they no longer need 
California to "do California." The only way the homegrown companies can 
survive, he concluded, is to become more authentic, more visionary and more 
creative. 
</P>
<P>
A walk through the exhibition hall validated his message. On the one hand, rows 
of manufacturers hawked essentially interchangeable lines of T-shirts, bathing 
suits and shorts with little flair or originality. But there were also a 
handful of companies that displayed the imagination, enthusiasm and sense of 
purpose that Glen believes the times demand. 
</P>
<P>
The Powell Corp., a leading skateboard company, for instance, cleverly 
satirized the entire proceedings by taking their orders inside a makeshift 
World War II bunker. They brought in a real tank, built a fence covered with 
artificial dried brown "leaves," shot photographs of models in '40s pinup style 
and offered visitors cold mineral waters. Just as Glen had predicted, their 
salespeople, clad in military khaki, were beseiged by hordes of buyers, friends 
and curiousity-seekers responding to the witty presentation. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy'Z took an entirely different approach. Unlike most of the other leading 
activewear companies, it makes no bones about bypassing the hardcore surfer and 
skater for the hip Barney's or Fred Segal customer. 
</P>
<P>
"Our clothes are contemporary street sportswear that blend California life 
style and art, and that just happen to have beach origins," Sepp Donahower, the 
company's co-founder, says. 
</P>
<P>
Their booth reflected that difference. To get even a glimpse of their clothes, 
one had to pass through a wall of hanging black rubber Jimmy'Z banners into a 
dark, cavelike room. Inside were tables, a series of stark black platforms for 
the fashion show and a disc jockey who spun eclectic, intelligent dance music. 
</P>
<P>
The clothing was equally distinctive. In the midst of an exhibition hall full 
of bright colors, Jimmy'Z featured blacks, whites, grays and blues, frequently 
in solids or free-form prints, sometimes on or with denim. The neon that was 
used was done so sparingly and to best effect in a unique neon plaid short. 
</P>
<P>
While Jimmy'Z describes itself as "real clothes for real people," Body Glove 
actively pursues the hard-core market. "We made our name for the past 35 years 
with wet suits," Greg Licht, national sales manager, says "and we have no 
intention of abandoning them now." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, they broadened that appeal considerably by introducing the first 
woman's neoprene bathing suits accented by the then-unfamiliar hot pinks, 
greens and yellows. Judging from this season's progressive collection and 
fever-pitched fashion show, their position is even stronger this year. 
</P>
<P>
With an unmatched flair for mixing fabrics, they brought out volley shorts made 
of Tactel, a fast-drying fabric, with neoprene at the waist; women's one-piece 
bathing suits with strategically located clear plastic squares; tie-dyed Lycra 
and lace tops, and hot pink or green high heels with the black-and-yellow Body 
Glove logo stamped on the shoe. It is as haute as beach couture gets and was 
greeted with a frenzy by buyers at the booth. 
</P>
<P>
It was not just these companies but the organizers of the expo itself who rose 
to Glen's challenge. On the first night of the show, they hosted a fund-raiser 
for the Surfrider Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to beach 
preservation, and presented them with a $5,000 donation. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized that the industry needs only two conditions to thrive: a clean 
environment and access to good beaches," Brad Bonhall, editor of Action Sports 
Retailer magazine, says. "The Surfrider Foundation has been working for exactly 
these goals for a number of years, and we thought we should help. 
</P>
<P>
"In retrospect," he continues, "we also were inspired by working with Peter 
Glen. His philosophy is to 'just do it.' So we did."

MAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEIL FEINEMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In William Kennedy's new novel, "Quinn's Book," a 17th-Century industrialist 
bemoans the appearance of English soldiers "in tatters so advanced that ladies 
were advised to avert their eyes when passing." 
</P>
<P>
A similar eye for propriety was evident at the MAGIC (Men's Apparel Guild in 
California) trade show at the Convention Center this week. The conservative 
merchandise and muted displays of more than 3,000 exhibitors convincingly 
demonstrated that, GQ notwithstanding, most men care less about what is in, 
than about simply covering their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Even Vision Street Wear's skateboard-oriented clothing line, one of the few to 
make an identifiable visual statement, courts a customer that may not be 
interested in fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"Some (of our clients) care, some don't," said Brad Dorfman, president of the 
12-year-old skateboard firm that has made sportswear for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who do care want a street look, as opposed to a surf look," he said. 
"They mainly want black, which is simple, fashionable and easy to wear." 
</P>
<P>
Dark colors predominate here, punctuated by tie-dye and bold street graphics, 
as well as by a fit that accommodates the skateboard life style. 
</P>
<P>
The pants have peg legs, and, to facilitate movement, loose hips and thighs. 
Heavyweight jeans feature double-reinforced knees that can withstand falls or 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Ca Va, an award-winning Seattle-based company, is working the opposite end of 
the spectrum. Their clothes blend the frequently antithetical qualities of 
"sophistication and fun," and are aimed at fashion-conscious men from 20 to 50. 
</P>
<P>
"These consumers probably bought the Britannia label back when it was the only 
game in town, and a pink shirt was as wild as men's clothes got," said Tom 
Hermann, president of the 2-year-old firm. 
</P>
<P>
"They are older now, but still don't like oxford- cloth shirts and khaki pants. 
Because they don't have the money for Armani or Hugo Boss, they look for 
affordable, wearable, quality fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Ca Va's clothes are meant to impress without being gaudy. One sport jacket, for 
instance, is cut quite short "to give it a better look when men put their hands 
in their pants pockets." 
</P>
<P>
An Inverness cloak updates the Sherlock Holmes look with details, such as a 
scarf loop, that are not generally found in $200 overcoats. A cotton duster is 
oversize and water-repellent. 
</P>
<P>
By nature, Hermann explains, this market is resistant to change. For starters, 
"men are far more loyal to a label than women are. Once they find a company 
they like, they will seek it out and stick with it." 
</P>
<P>
Most of these companies and their customers are more than happy to let someone 
else try the unusual new looks on for size. "It takes at least 18 months for an 
idea to filter down to a mass level," Hermann says. 
</P>
<P>
"We always knew, for example that the baggy thigh, narrow-leg pant was more 
comfortable. But it took years for men to wear that silhouette. Now that it's 
established, tighter pants feel strange." 
</P>
<P>
As if to prove his point, there, right in the middle of the Levi Strauss 
fashion show, was a pair of baggy-thigh, narrow-leg jeans. That wasn't all. 
There were also pleated jeans, stonewashed jeans and jeans with 
Girbaud-inspired labels at mid-fly.

BREA MAN IS SLAIN IN AMBUSH; 
</P>
<P>
VICTIM WAS SUBJECT OF TAX FRAUD PROBE INTO TOPLESS BARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former California Highway Patrol officer under investigation for tax fraud in 
connection with the operation of several Los Angeles nude and topless bars was 
killed in a hail of gunfire early Thursday as he arrived at the gate of his 
remote Brea home in a chauffeured limousine. 
</P>
<P>
Horace Joseph McKenna, 46, a body builder whose sprawling $825,000 estate 
reportedly was guarded at times by men with machine guns, died instantly in the 
gangland-style ambush at 12:30 a.m., police said. The motive was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna, who had convictions for counterfeiting and assault, was killed only 
hours after Los Angeles Superior Court records were unsealed detailing a 
district attorney's investigation of him and a business partner, Michael Woods, 
also a former CHP officer. These records alleged that McKenna and Woods were 
the hidden owners of several nude and topless bars. 
</P>
<P>
The 300-page file, unsealed Wednesday at the request of attorneys for McKenna 
and Woods, named several associates of Woods and McKenna, including at least 
eight who allegedly conspired with them to hide profits and skim money. 
Authorities were close to filing charges against McKenna at the time of his 
death, Los Angeles County district attorney's spokesman Andy Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
Several law enforcement agencies -- including the Los Angeles police and the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the Long Beach police and the FBI -- 
had monitored McKenna's and Woods' alleged hidden interests in the bars, as 
well as illegal gambling, narcotics and prostitution activities, according to 
the documents. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that McKenna and Woods "have maintained associations with 
terminated, retired and currently employed law enforcement officers, thus 
making this investigation extremely sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
The shooting broke out as McKenna's chauffeur, Bob Berg, was returning to the 
car after unlocking the gated entrance to the home, known as Tara Ranch, in the 
6200 block of Carbon Canyon Road, police and employees at the ranch said. 
McKenna, physically imposing at 300 pounds, had been asleep in the car, police 
said. After the attack, Berg, 42, who was unhurt, drove to the house, a mile 
and a half away. 
</P>
<P>
Berg, reached by telephone Thursday night, said he would have no comment "until 
I talk to a lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to talk about it, I've had enough," Berg said, his voice 
trembling. Berg was identified in the unsealed documents as one of the eight 
men who allegedly conspired with McKenna and Woods in the tax case. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that "McKenna appears to live a life style which apparently 
exceeds his reported income." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flamboyant Character 
</P>
<P>
At 6 feet 6, McKenna was known as "Mac or Big Mac or just Big," said an 
associate who described him as a flamboyant and mysterious character who kept 
exotic animals on his ranch, where he also entertained nightclub dancers. 
McKenna was recently divorced from his wife Sherry, who feared for her life 
because of threats from him, according to her attorney, Richard Debro. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna had a history of confrontation with authorities, including a federal 
conviction for conspiracy to counterfeit in 1976, a Los Angeles conviction for 
assault with a weapon in a San Pedro bar in 1982, and a record of arrests for 
running what was described as a large prostitution ring in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
As a convicted felon, McKenna would not be legally qualified to own businesses 
that hold liquor licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Since buying the Brea property 2 years ago for $825,000, McKenna had stocked 
the ranch with Arabian show horses -- some worth as much as $20,000, friends 
said. He remodeled a sprawling, ranch-style home on the property, installed a 
swimming pool and rose garden and was in the process of completing an Old 
West-style "ghost town," complete with a Main Street and facades of a saloon, 
blacksmith shop and bank, they said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bill Gray, 42, owner of the Star Gym in Brea where McKenna worked 
out, McKenna owned several wild animals, including a leopard, a 500-pound tiger 
and an elephant. On June 23, 1988, state Department of Fish and Game 
authorities seized 2 spider monkeys, a black leopard and a tiger at the 
property because they were being kept illegally, a department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
An undercover police officer, investigators said, once overheard McKenna say 
that his personal wealth included the Brea property, a penthouse apartment, 
Arabian horses and a $20,000 boot collection. The bars grossed as much as 
$2,561,900 a year, investigators estimated. 
</P>
<P>
According to the massive investigative file, authorities had in recent months 
interviewed numerous employees and concluded that many were "extremely loyal" 
to McKenna and Woods while others were intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
Some spoke confidentially, investigators said, apparently out of "extreme fear" 
of McKenna and Woods because they were former law enforcement officers and 
because of McKenna's size and "intimidating manner," the documents said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tutty, 31, McKenna's longtime friend and a member at the 4 Star Gym in El 
Segundo, which KcKenna owned, described him Thursday as "a very intimidating 
person. . . . He was a person who commanded attention. He wanted people to know 
who he was. He had a big ego, and he needed fodder for that ego. And he pretty 
much got it." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tutty said: "He liked the ladies, there's no doubt about it. He was 
very gracious to the ladies." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Sermas, one of several female horse trainers for McKenna, said Thursday 
that he entertained friends and business associates by taking them on horseback 
rides and giving them "guided tours of his ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Entertained 'Bimbos' 
</P>
<P>
McKenna also regularly entertained a group of young women whom he laughingly 
referred to as his "bimbos" because they worked as dancers at nightclubs in the 
Los Angeles area, according to Sermas and Ingrid Locken, another horse trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Locken and Sermas said they were under the impression that the clubs featured 
topless dancing, and they added that the women whom McKenna brought out to the 
ranch "dressed in sleazy outfits." 
</P>
<P>
Another member of the El Segundo gym, Pete Cahill, 35, called McKenna "the most 
lovable gangster in the world. If he was a gangster, I guess that's the way 
you've got to go." 
</P>
<P>
Cahill said that at the gym it was understood that McKenna "owned a lot of 
topless places. It was an unspoken thing, everybody knew but nobody talked 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
A native of New Orleans, McKenna served with the CHP from June, 1968, to June, 
1972, working in the West Los Angeles area before resigning from the force, 
according to a CHP spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County court records show that McKenna pleaded guilty early in 1973 
to one count of credit card forgery, and that five other counts were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
On April 14, 1976, McKenna surrendered to Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies 
investigating what they said was a prostitution ring centered in the Inglewood 
and Lennox areas. McKenna, vice squad deputies said, was being sought as a 
suspected kingpin of the ring. 
</P>
<P>
They linked McKenna and the prostitution operation to establishments called the 
Institute of Oral Love, Sexual Relief Center and Wild Mary's. The latter two 
were temporarily shut down during the investigation. The outcome of that case 
was not known Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna was convicted of conspiracy and counterfeiting on July 16, 1976, and 
sentenced to serve 6 years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna became the focus of the tax fraud investigation in mid-1987, 
authorities said. In recent months, according to the documents, investigators 
were developing a case that McKenna was living well beyond his means. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators estimated mortgage payments at $70,000 per year on the Carbon 
Canyon property, purchased in February, 1986. In addition, they said, McKenna 
employed groundskeepers to maintain the horse training track, Western movie 
set, grounds and residence. 
</P>
<P>
"Both estimated monthly payments and employment cost well exceeds McKenna's 
reported income of $44,431 . . . and strongly suggests that the McKennas were 
involved in a fraudulent loan application scheme or received funds from 
unreported income," investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Sherry McKenna has no other source of income. The couple was 
divorced in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Debro, the attorney for McKenna's former wife, said McKenna "used drugs and 
became incredibly violent." He said Sherry McKenna has been in hiding. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen her after she had been beaten up (by him), the black eyes, things 
like that," Debro said. "The law didn't mean anything to him. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she had no doubt in her mind that he would kill her or have her 
killed" if she insisted on fighting their ultimate divorce case settlement, the 
attorney said. "He had threatened to kill her with a gun to her head." 
</P>
<P>
When McKenna and his then-girlfriend rented an apartment in El Segundo in 1987, 
investigators noted, McKenna listed his annual gross income as $44,431. 
Investigators said they believed McKenna uses the 4 Star Gym as a legitimate 
source of income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big, Lovable Man 
</P>
<P>
Neither Gray nor other friends and associates contacted Thursday professed any 
idea who would have wanted to harm him. They described McKenna as a big, 
lovable man building a shangri la on his ranch for the pleasure of friends and 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't a mean bone in his body," said Gray. "He would take people's kids 
up (to the ranch) and give them horseback rides." 
</P>
<P>
Sermas said McKenna was in the process of installing an electronic gate at his 
home so the chauffeur would not have to get out of the limousine every time 
they entered. She said that the gate was ready to be installed as soon as 
Southern California Edison Co. work crews came out to hook it up. 
</P>
<P>
While police tried to piece together details of the attack, one resident 
recalled that she had thought nothing of three visitors to McKenna's home on 
Wednesday night, although later they seemed ominous. About 6:55 p.m., the 
neighbor said, she watched three people "going over the fence." One had a 
flashlight. Police would not immediately comment on that or other details of 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela Ferrero said she didn't know what relationship the 
unsealing of the court documents had with the murder. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you one thing. It's real surprising that a tax law investigation 
turned out like this. Maybe there's something we don't know about." 
</P>
<P>
Contributing to coverage of this story were staff writers Richard Beene, Jim 
Carlton, Dianne Klein, Eric Lichtblau and Nancy Wride in Orange County, and 
Richard Colvin, Hector Tobar, Sebastian Rotella and Boris Yaro in Los Angeles.

N. TUSTIN RESIDENTS FEAR PET DEATHS TIED TO SATANISM BUT OFFICIALS BLAME 
COYOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A series of killings of cats and other small pets in sections of North Tustin 
and nearby communities has alarmed pet owners and sparked an investigation by 
county animal control officials. 
</P>
<P>
The officials have all but concluded that the killings were done by coyotes 
searching for food, but some of the residents are not buying that explanation. 
</P>
<P>
If coyotes are killing the pets, one of the residents said this week, then they 
are coyotes that carry Swiss Army knives. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Hampson, who lives on Malena Street in North Tustin, says she has 
documented the killing of nearly 50 cats and other animals since last May by 
human hands -- by someone with a knife who is cutting up the animal body parts 
and collecting the blood, perhaps to use in some kind of satanic ritual. 
</P>
<P>
Hampson has embarked on a one-woman campaign to alert pet owners to what she 
fears is a danger more sinister than hungry coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
"The only people who think we're dealing with coyotes are the authorities," 
said Hampson, a part-time political consultant and owner of three cats. She 
plans to plaster the area with fliers that describe the deaths and urge people 
to keep their pets indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Hampson is backed in her effort by the owners of the dead animals, many of whom 
said they found their pets cut in two or more pieces with what appeared to be a 
sharp knife or surgical tool. In nearly every case, the pet owners said, there 
was little or no blood in, on or around the animal's carcass. 
</P>
<P>
Hampson has collected information on 43 cases, some of which involved more than 
one animal, from parts of North Tustin, Tustin, Orange and Villa Park. She said 
the reports include instances where intestines, severed paws and internal 
organs appeared to have been washed and neatly arranged around the body. In 
other cases, body parts and organs were missing. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of blood has led Hampson and some of the pet owners to wonder if some 
sort of cult is involved. Hampson has been looking for clues in literature on 
satanism. 
</P>
<P>
Police and animal control officials concede that "isolated" instances of 
satanic activity may be occurring in the county, but they said they doubt that 
the animals Hampson has cited were killed for rituals. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Edwards, chief of field services for the county's Animal Control Division, 
said he has seen the materials gathered by Hampson and has not changed his 
opinion that the pets were killed either by coyotes or dogs or while they were 
sleeping on the engine of a car to keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had to cut many a cat out of a fan belt or an engine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Three reports of mutilated cats that animal control officers responded to this 
week turned out to be coyote kills, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Although the vast majority of the dead animals have been cats, a few reports 
have involved rabbits, ducks, gerbils, birds and opossums. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like this," said Dr. James Connoyer, a North Tustin 
veterinarian whose cat, Keoke, was found last May on a neighbor's lawn cut 
horizontally in perfect halves. 
</P>
<P>
Connoyer, who worked for 4 years as an emergency veterinarian at the Orange 
County Emergency Pet Clinic in Garden Grove and who has seen the carcasses of 
two cats besides his own, said he is familiar with how a pet that has been 
mauled by a wild animal looks. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard for me to imagine that these were typical of attacks by dogs or 
coyotes," he said. "Organs were missing. The animals were severed in half very 
cleanly. There were no bite wounds anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Hayes of Orange and his wife, Terri, said that last September they found 
the head of their cat on their lawn facing toward the east with two of its paws 
lined up neatly in front. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel safe. I haven't for a long time," said Terri Hayes. "I'm afraid 
to let my daughter play outside. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by a reporter and a photographer, Hampson this week examined 
drainage ditches in Tustin, Orange and North Tustin, looking for signs of 
satanic activity. The ditches were mentioned as places where cats were killed 
in an article last month in the Tustin News. 
</P>
<P>
Of five ditches examined, three contained graffiti that were later identified 
as associated with Satanism. The outside of a storm drain pipe in Tustin near 
Walnut Avenue and Cherrywood Lane was covered with such graffiti. The words 
"Satanic Rules" were scrawled in grease pencil on the ceiling of the pipe, 
which is large enough for an adult to walk inside. 
</P>
<P>
Satanism was not ruled out by Mike Burns, an animal control administrator for 
the city of Los Angeles who is familiar with the use of animals in sacrifices 
and other rituals. 
</P>
<P>
Burns, who this week presented the Los Angeles Board of Animal Regulation with 
a voluminous report on the subject, said that animal blood, organs and body 
parts are a major part of satanic rituals. 
</P>
<P>
Burns reviewed the material collected by Hampson and concluded that satanists 
or someone trying to emulate them could be involved. He based his conclusion, 
he stressed, solely on descriptions of the carcasses provided to Hampson by the 
owners of the pets. He noted that some of the killings occurred on or around 
satanic holidays, such as St. Winebald's Day, which is Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wild Animal Killings 
</P>
<P>
"Assuming that the descriptions are accurate, I would say you're not dealing 
with wild animals," he said. "I've never seen a coyote string intestines in a 
line alongside a body. 
</P>
<P>
"A coyote will usually eat the entrails first and will eat the liver and heart, 
but when you're talking about a cat cut in half or with its chest cut open and 
two front paws missing -- no, you're not talking coyote." 
</P>
<P>
But an animal control officer who was spotted looking for coyote tracks at a 
drainage ditch in North Tustin, said he is convinced that a coyote can bite a 
cat in half without spraying blood all around. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen many of these cases," he said, "and they always turn out to be cat 
versus coyote."

D.A. WON'T FILE CHARGES IN ALLEGED ATTACK ON BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office has declined to file charges 
against an 18-year-old Huntington Beach man who was arrested and held on 
suspicion of attempted murder after he allegedly slammed a 9-year-old boy onto 
the cement at Huntington City Beach, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Travis A. Marshall was suspected of picking up the boy, slamming him to the 
cement and then leaping on his back on a beach bicycle path Sunday, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the boy did not seek medical help after the incident, but he 
complained of pains Monday morning while he was in school. He was taken to 
Pacifica Community Hospital, where his ruptured spleen was removed. 
</P>
<P>
But Huntington Beach Police Sgt. William Stuart said that Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Jan Nolan "declined to issue a complaint" pending further investigation and 
examination of the 9-year-old's medical records. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall, who was taken into custody on Tuesday, was released from custody on 
Wednesday, Stuart said.

VETERANS GROUP SUES TO STOP REPARATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. government plan to publicly apologize and pay $20,000 to 
Japanese-Americans who were interned during World War II is unconstitutional, 
the Anaheim-based American War Veterans Relief Assn. Inc. claimed in a lawsuit 
filed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The plan violates constitutional guarantees by "denying payment to or even 
acknowledging the existence of the German- and Italian-Americans placed in 
relocation and internment centers alongside the Japanese," said John P. Coale, 
attorney for the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Takahashi, representing the Japanese-American Citizens League, called the 
suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, "groundless" and 
said she expects it to "fizzle." 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim organization provides financial assistance to veterans across the 
country and refers them to hospitals through a toll-free number, according to 
Albert Lyon, 65, a World War II veteran and a part-time employee with the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon said the organization, which claims 30,000 members, is a two-man operation 
consisting of himself and John Kirby, who founded it in 1980.

OWNER OF IMMIGRATION FIRMS HELD ON TAX EVASION CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BEENE and CARLA RIVERA, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An El Toro businessman already under investigation for allegedly defrauding 
Spanish-speaking immigrants seeking work papers was arrested Thursday on 12 
felony counts of tax evasion, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Salinas, 51, owner of one of Southern California's largest immigrant 
legalization services, was taken into custody at his El Toro home Thursday 
morning and placed in Orange County Jail. Bail was set at $250,000 and an 
arraignment was scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gerald G. Johnston said Salinas, who also uses the name Jan 
Vouziers, was charged with eight counts of failure to pay payroll taxes for his 
employees and four counts of failure to file 1987-88 state income tax returns 
for his employees. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas is the owner of one of the region's largest immigrant assistance 
companies, with offices in Orange, Los Angeles, San Diego and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, including the Orange County Coalition for Immigrant Rights, have long 
complained that Salinas' companies, which operate under different names, are 
guilty of sloppy and incomplete work in handling and processing residency and 
work applications for thousands of Spanish-speaking immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston said his office has been investigating Salinas for more than 6 months 
in connection with complaints that he has lured immigrants to his businesses by 
making false promises of providing amnesty, residency or temporary work 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd estimate he has about 5,000 clients," Johnston said. "Depending on the 
program, it is very expensive. It can be up to $2,500 apiece for labor 
certification, and we think that there are about 2,000 people there." 
</P>
<P>
Johnston added that "there have been a number of complaints that people were 
lied to or not fully informed. Some people said they were not told they were 
not qualified but their money was taken anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Salinas also has been under investigation by the U.S. Labor Department, which 
sent two investigators to Orange County to assist in his arrest Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston said the case was made difficult because many of Salinas' customers 
are poorly educated, possibly in the country without proper papers and are 
afraid to speak to authorities for fear they will be deported. 
</P>
<P>
Although the tax evasion charges have nothing to do with the fraud 
investigation, Johnston said his office thought it was important to make the 
case because "we felt that there was a real concern of injury to the community 
and we needed to do something." 
</P>
<P>
Johnston said some of Salinas' firms operate under the names Hispanic Law 
Center, Attorney Management Services, H2A Growers Services and Southern 
California Immigration Center. 
</P>
<P>
He said Salinas attracted customers primarily by advertising extensively on 
Spanish-language radio. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Blackwell, coordinator of the Coalition for Immigrant Rights, said her 
office has been "receiving complaints daily about him." 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of gullible and innocent people who are hurt," said Blackwell, 
whose office has been assisting the district attorney's office in its 
investigation of Salinas.

ALISO VIEJO SETTLEMENT IN JEOPARDY; 
</P>
<P>
GROWTH ACTIVIST REFUSES TO SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A tentative settlement reached last January in a lawsuit to block the 
20,000-unit Aliso Viejo project is in danger of falling apart because a key 
slow-growth advocate is refusing to sign the agreement and is insisting on 
pursuing court action. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Rogers, who led the unsuccessful campaign for a countywide slow-growth 
initiative last year, said Thursday that he will not sign the settlement 
agreement even though lawyers for Citizens for Sensible Growth and Traffic 
Control and the Laguna Greenbelt environmental group, which brought the 
lawsuit, have strongly urged him to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't sign it," Rogers said Thursday. "Greg Hile has told me I have to, but 
I won't." Hile is the attorney for the slow-growth organization. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers believes that his signature on the agreement is a key element because, 
he said, the Mission Viejo Co., parent company of the developer of the Aliso 
Viejo project, has made it a condition of the settlement. But Rogers said he 
believes the lawsuit still has merit and that he wants to pursue it. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Laguna Beach and Irvine, which had joined the environmental and 
slow-growth groups in support of the court action, signed settlement agreements 
with the developer in January. Terms of the settlement basically require all 
parties to drop their legal actions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planned Community 
</P>
<P>
Aliso Viejo is a planned community whose lead developer is the Aliso Viejo Co., 
a subsidiary of the Mission Viejo Co. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint against the Aliso Viejo development was filed in Orange County 
Superior Court to challenge the constitutionality of the project's development 
agreement, which was approved early last year by the Board of Supervisors. 
Rogers and other slow-growth advocates argued that the agreement, and more than 
a dozen similar documents affecting other planned communities, were an illegal 
attempt to circumvent the countywide slow-growth initiative, which subsequently 
was defeated at the polls last June. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taxpayer Benefits 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that taxpayers will not receive any benefit from the 
development agreement that could not have been charged to the Mission Viejo Co. 
anyway, during the county's normal development approval process. Under state 
law, extraordinary benefits are required to justify such development 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
Hile said Thursday that he doesn't need Rogers' signature to settle the case, 
but he acknowledged that he wants Rogers to cooperate. No money is available to 
continue paying costs of the lawsuit, Hile said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's only one member of the board," Hile said of Citizens for Sensible Growth 
and Traffic Control. "We can get other board members to sign, but we're still 
negotiating details of the settlement." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers said he may try to raise money on his own to hire another lawyer to 
pursue the case. "The settlement agreement is terrible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A Mission Viejo Co. spokeswoman said the firm would have no comment because 
"there are no signatures on the settlement" and the lawsuit is still active.

TOLLWAYS DIRECTOR GETS RAISE DESPITE EARLIER OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
Orange County tollway officials voted unanimously Thursday to give the head of 
the Transportation Corridor Agencies an 11.8% pay raise, despite opposition a 
day earlier from Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
The same officials also voted -- despite objections -- to repay the county 
about $1.1 million for planning work done by the county in preparation for 
tollway construction. The work took place before the special tollway agencies 
were created. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo City Councilman Robert A. Curtis, among others, objected that 
there are no files documenting any agreement to repay the county, and that 
Thursday's decision was based on staff assurances that there had been an "oral 
understanding" reached with the county more than 4 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The vote on Executive Director John Meyer's salary increase of $10,000 took 
place after members of the agencies' two boards of directors held a closed 
personnel session. During the session, several members contended that no formal 
performance evaluation procedure had been developed yet for giving Meyer 
feedback about his performance, according to members who attended the meeting 
in Santa Ana. For that reason, they argued, the issue should be narrowly 
focused on whether the $10,000 raise -- from $85,000 to $95,000 -- was a 
well-deserved cost-of-living adjustment, members said. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer received his last raise 2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Riley and some other supervisors had said they would oppose 
Meyer's salary increase at Thursday's board meeting, citing delays in 
processing environmental, design and cost-estimating work, and unresolved 
questions about some expenses. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday's discussion behind closed doors never reached the point where 
specific gripes were aired, board members said. And Riley and other critics of 
Meyer joined with the majority in approving the raise when the regular meeting 
resumed. 
</P>
<P>
Riley did not comment during the vote, but Mission Viejo Councilman Curtis 
cited Meyer's heavy workload, staffing shortages and the uniqueness of the 
effort to build tollways in California as an explanation for some of the 
difficulties Meyer has faced. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Riley said simply that he was convinced that the raise was 
not going to be a merit award. "I don't talk about what is said in executive 
sessions," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Same Staff, 2 Boards 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Corridor Agencies are building three tollways in eastern and 
southern Orange County that are scheduled to open in the early to middle 1990s. 
The agencies share the same staff and office but have two governing boards: One 
oversees the Foothill and Eastern tollways; the other directs the San Joaquin 
Hills tollway project. 
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's meeting, Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, who serves on the boards 
of both the San Joaquin Hills and Foothill/Eastern Corridor boards, said he was 
concerned that tollway construction costs have escalated to between $2 billion 
and $3 billion from the $1 billion projected several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we received low-ball projections early on to bring as many people as 
possible into this thing," Agran said after Thursday's meeting. "It's 
imperative that the agency and the staff own up to the fact that we're now in 
the $2-billion to $3-billion range." 
</P>
<P>
Escalating costs could have serious implications for the financial feasibility 
of the tollways, because 48.5% of the construction costs are supposed to come 
from developer fees. But it is not clear whether those fees can be increased at 
a later date. The remaining share of the construction cost is expected to be 
covered by the sale of bonds, which would be repaid with toll revenue as well 
as state and federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
The fee issue is being reviewed, and revised cost estimates for the three 
tollways are scheduled to be delivered to board members within 30 days, 
according to tollway officials. 
</P>
<P>
An independent financial review of the agency also is under way. 
</P>
<P>
In order to speed construction of the Foothill Corridor, board members voted 
Thursday to contract with James McConnell, the county's lobbyist in Washington, 
to try to win Federal Highway Administration permission to build a segment 
through Rancho Mission Viejo with partial environmental documentation rather 
than the complete environmental impact statement for the full length of the 
tollway.

THIS TIME, CORONA DEL MAR FALLS SHORT

<P>
The prospect of deja-disaster in the air, not to mention on the court, the 
Morningside High School boys' basketball team did what it could not do two 
weeks ago: play under control. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside defeated Corona del Mar, 53-46, in the Southern California Regional 
Division III semifinals Thursday at Corona del Mar, avenging a loss to the Sea 
Kings two weeks ago in the Southern Section 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Revenge is sweet," said Ron Randle, Morningside's co-coach. "We've never (this 
season) lost to a team twice in a row. I told them don't let this be the 
first." 
</P>
<P>
All the elements were there for a repeat. Corona del Mar defeated Morningside, 
57-56, in overtime in the semifinals. Corona del Mar did it after trailing by 
four points with 2 minutes left in the game. But Morningside fouled Corona del 
Mar back into contention. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Morningside led, 48-44, with 2 minutes remaining. With 1:52 left, 
Morningside's Chris Vance was called for an offensive foul which sent Corona 
del Mar's Chris Pliha to the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Pliha, who had eight points in the game, missed the front end of the 
one-and-one, but Morningside was called for a lane violation giving Pliha 
another chance. He made both and Corona del Mar trailed, 46-44. 
</P>
<P>
On its ensuing possession, Morningside appeared content to hold the ball when 
guard Kenny Jones drove to the baseline and made a short jump shot. A Corona 
del Mar miss was followed by another shot by Jones, which missed, but Vance 
rebounded, made a layup and was fouled. 
</P>
<P>
Vance, who had 12 points, nine in the second half, made the free throw to put 
Morningside up, 53-46, with less than 35 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"When Kenny made that shot I was convinced we were going to win," Randle said. 
"We didn't attack in the first game. We didn't make the same mistake twice. 
Down the stretch we played smart and aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside led, 11-8, with five seconds left in the first quarter on Arthur 
Savage's short jump shot, but Corona del Mar guard Matt Cwiertnia drove the 
length of the court, and past the entire Morningside team to score at the 
buzzer to draw Corona del Mar to 11-10. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar took a 15-13 led early in the second quarter on Jeff Clark's 
three-point shot, but Morningside regained the lead at 23-22 when Don Sanders 
made a layup with 6 seconds left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar did have a chance to put some distance between it and 
Morningside through free throws, but it made only two of eight foul shots in 
the last 2 minutes of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"We just missed too many free throws in the first half," said Paul Orris, 
Corona del Mar coach. "We've got to make those shots. If we do, we've got about 
a four- or five-point lead going into the half." 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar did manage to rally, and, in fact, held a five-point at 34-29, 
with 1:47 left in the third quarter. But Morningside outscored Corona del Mar, 
10-2, in that last minute and a half, tying the score at 36-36 on Eddie Scott's 
turn-around jump shot and taking a 39-36 lead on Jon Madison's three-point shot 
at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar struck back fast. Cwiertnia made a three-point shot just 5 
seconds into the fourth quarter to tie the score, 39-39. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside went ahead for good at 40-39 on Arthur Savage's free throw.

HERALDS LOSE A LONG-RANGE BATTLE, 74-61

<P>
Word of the considerable exploits of Carl Ray Harris spread as far south as 
Whittier Christian High School in La Habra this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Heralds knew of his array of dunks and other crowd-pleasing moves to the 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
What they learned to their dismay was that Harris, a 6-foot-2 guard for 
Washington High of Easton, Calif., is not limited to acrobatic moves. He also 
has a soft touch from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Harris showed off his long-range shooting in Washington's 74-61 victory over 
Whittier Christian in a Southern California Regionals Division IV semifinal 
game Thursday at Fresno City College. 
</P>
<P>
His versatility is one of the reasons he is the Central Section's all-time 
single-season scoring leader. Harris, who has signed a letter of intent to play 
at Fresno State next season, passed Clifton Pondexter, a former Cal State Long 
Beach and National Basketball Assn. player who played at San Joaquin Memorial 
in the early 1970s. Harris has 822 points this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't realize how good Harris was from three-point range," Whittier 
Christian Coach Bob Brown said. "We talked about stopping his dunks and keeping 
the crowd out of the game. Maybe the kids were a little too concerned about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Harris had a game-high 27 points, including three three-pointers in the first 
half, to lead Washington (25-5) to the Regional final against Santa Clara at 
Cal State Dominguez Hills Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian finished its most successful season with a 23-7 record. 
</P>
<P>
The Hearlds, who won their first Southern Section title last week, also learned 
that Washington's supporting cast also can inflict damage. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Brad Gardner was particularly troublesome for Whittier Christian. He 
had 20 points and helped seal the victory with a pair of free throws with 1 
minute 18 seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Sonny Burton, a reserve guard, added 13 points and also made two key free 
throws late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thinks we're just a one-man team," Washington Coach Al Biancalana 
said. "One guy can't carry a team unless he's a 6-8 guy. Carl Ray doesn't carry 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Harris had only eight of his 27 points in the second half and that contributed 
greatly to a fourth-quarter rally by Whittier Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Washington took control of the game, leading, 23-14, at the end of the first 
quarter. The Panthers maintained a six- to 14-point advantage until Whittier 
Christian got hot from the outside midway through the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
A three-point basket by guard Matt Riehm pulled the Heralds to within 60-55. 
</P>
<P>
Washington started to pull away again after Burton made a short jumper and 
Harris, who made nine of 16 from the field including two dunks, drove for a 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
But Whittier Christian didn't fade. Center Scott Ferguson made a turnaround 
jumper and forward Rob Diaz followed a moment later with a basket and Whittier 
Christian was down, 64-61, with 1:35 left. But that was as close as the Heralds 
could get. 
</P>
<P>
Washington regrouped as Gardner and Burton made key free throws for a 68-61 
lead with 1:02 left. The Panthers added four more free throws and Gardner 
scored at the buzzer as Whittier Christian went scoreless in the final 1:35. 
</P>
<P>
"We picked up momentum in the second half but it seemed like we didn't have 
enough 'umph' to complete the rally," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul McKinley led Whittier Christian with 20 points and Ferguson had 16 to go 
with nine rebounds and three blocked shots.

Orange Lutheran High School missed the front ends of three one-and-one free 
throw opportunities in the final 40 seconds and lost to Santa Clara, 71-70, in 
a Southern California Regionals Division IV semifinal in front of 2,500 
Thursday night at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second loss for Orange Lutheran (24-5) in less than a week to the 
state's top-ranked Division IV team. Five days ago, the Lancers were blown out 
by Santa Clara, 78-54, in the Southern Section 2-A Division title game at the 
Los Angeles Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Orange Lutheran held a 70-69 lead with 1 minute 5 seconds to play, 
but then the game slipped away when it failed to make pressure free throws. 
Santa Clara (25-3) will advance to the division's title game against Washington 
High Saturday at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran had missed just one free throw in 22 previous attempts before 
misfiring in the final 47 seconds. Santa Clara's Shon Tarver, who scored 24 of 
the Saints' 36 points in the second half, sealed the victory by making two free 
throws with 9 seconds left to play. 
</P>
<P>
"We had three chances and failed," Orange Lutheran Coach Jerry Simmons said. "I 
felt we should have beat them but you can't win a close ballgame if you don't 
make your free throws at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran's misfortune began with 47 seconds left when freshman point 
guard Luke Aucoin missed a free throw with his team leading, 70-69. Tarver 
answered with two free throws 15 seconds later to give Santa Clara the lead for 
good, 71-70. 
</P>
<P>
Still Orange Lutheran had two more chances. 
</P>
<P>
First, reserve Brian Bedord missed a free throw with 16 seconds remaining but 
teammate Jason Neben managed to force a jump ball with Santa Clara center Bubba 
Burrage with 13 seconds left and the Lancers got possession. 
</P>
<P>
Next, it was Kent Dowding's turn at the line, but he missed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a combination of being good and lucky," said Lou Cvijanovich, Santa 
Clara's Coach. "They showed they are a good free-throw shooting team . . . 
until it counted. This is a crazy game, but that's what makes it the greatest. 
I told everyone at the Sports Arena that if we played Orange Lutheran again, it 
would be different. 
</P>
<P>
"They caught us on a good day the last time, and we got them on a bad day." 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran was a different team in the rematch. The Lancers opened a 40-35 
lead at the half by making 15 of 16 free throw but the momentum slowly shifted 
in Santa Clara's favor with Tarver taking control. 
</P>
<P>
He scored 13 of the Saints' 19 points in the third quarter and score was tied, 
54-54, going into the final quarter. He pushed Santa Clara ahead, 58-54, early 
in the period and the Saints remained in the lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Dowding's free throws with 2:31 remaining tied it, 64-64, and then the game 
became a free throw contest. 
</P>
<P>
Daryl Cole led Orange Lutheran with 21 points and center Pat Bagatourian added 
17 points before fouling out with 4:37 left. Tarver finished with 37 points, 
making 16 of 18 from the field.

Playing with an extra dose of intensity, teamwork and smarts, Trabuco Hills 
High School found its groove and defeated Lemoore, 86-79, in a Southern 
California Regional Division III semifinal game Thursday night at El Toro High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
The victory sends Trabuco Hills (24-6) into the Southern California Regional 
final against Morningside, a 53-46 winner over Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills, which defeated San Diego Clairemont, 87-60, in Tuesday's first 
round, found an even higher level of play against Lemoore. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an exciting game and fun too," Trabuco Hills Coach Rainer Wulf said. "I 
think we gave the crowd something exciting to watch tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Swanwick, who Tuesday overcame a frightful first-half shooting slump 
before scoring a career-high 32 points, had another good game, scoring 22 
points and grabbing 15 rebounds before being taken out midway through the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Trabuco Hills' biggest source of entertainment might have been its overall 
teamwork. The Mustangs, guided by guards Randy Kriech (14 points), Tim Manning 
(12 points) and reserve Louis Arenado (five steals, eight points), continually 
frustrated Lemoore with pinpoint passing and tricky dribbling. 
</P>
<P>
Lemoore's main weapon, 5-foot-9 guard Tommy Jones, scored a game-high 28 points 
including four three-pointers and had five steals. But even he had high praise 
for the Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
"They are hot, definitely hot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills opened up the game with a Swanwick bank shot in the key and a 
three-pointer by Poulos to take a 5-0 lead. The Tigers, pressed by Trabuco 
Hills' man-to-man defense, missed their first six shots. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, it was apparent Lemoore was going to have trouble with Trabuco 
Hills' well-balanced team. 
</P>
<P>
When Lemoore tried to double-team Swanwick, Swanwick passed to the perimeter 
where any of several Mustangs were ready to shoot. Kriech scored 10 points, 
including two back-to-back three-pointers to give Trabuco Hills a 28-16 
first-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
The balance -- from Swanwick's inside game to the sharp perimeter shooting of 
Kriech and Manning -- hounded Lemoore as it has many Mustang opponents this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so hard to defend this team," Lemoore Coach Jim Gordon said. "The big guy 
bangs inside, and they got those outside shooters." 
</P>
<P>
All of whom shot especially well -- 10 of 15 as a team -- in the first quarter. 
Lemoore was held to 7-of-21 shooting in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lemoore managed to find its running game in the second quarter, and 
outscored Trabuco Hills, 23-17, to cut its deficit to six (45-39), the Tigers 
couldn't handle Trabuco Hills' firepower late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
After two layups by Clarence Scott and a eight-foot jumper in the key by Jones, 
Lemoore had cut the lead to 47-45 just 3 minutes into the third quarter. 
Lemoore looked even more impressive as it held the Mustangs scoreless for 2 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But, with 2:39 left in the period, the Mustangs had had enough. Keyed by 
Poulos, who hit two three-pointers, and reserve John Goodman (eight points from 
within the key), the Mustangs broke open a 15-2 run to take a 63-47 lead into 
the fourth quarter.

SBA HONORS ADVOCATE FOR MINORITY BUSINESS; 
</P>
<P>
PACBELL EXECUTIVE CO-FOUNDED BUSINESS COUNCIL TO HELP BRIDGE GAPS BETWEEN 
ETHNIC GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH T. YAMADA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1965, Patricia A. Krone was appalled by the widespread destruction of homes 
and businesses during the violent race riots in the Watts section of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The riots happened because people in the mainstream ignored minorities," said 
Krone, 55, a resident of Newport Beach. "A community committed suicide because 
the different ethnic groups didn't realize there was value in helping each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
That realization ultimately served as the inspiration for Krone's work as a 
co-founder of the Orange County Minority Business Council, a nonprofit group 
created in March, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Krone was recognized as minority business advocate of the year by 
the U.S. Small Business Administration for her efforts on behalf of the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Krone is one of eight winners chosen for their advocacy of small business in a 
national competition. Advocates are "individuals who have used their 
professional expertise and personal talents to further the understanding and 
awareness of small business in their community," said Michael Howland, acting 
regional SBA director in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The eight people were picked from a pool of district winners by a panel of 
business, industrial and government leaders. Among the winners are three other 
Californians: Morris Van Asperen of Los Angeles, Joe Greenstreet of Marysville 
and Caryn Wiley of Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
Krone helped organize the minority business council in her role as a community 
relations manager for Pacific Bell in Orange. Besides Krone, other PacBell 
executives and representatives of the Orange County Chamber of Commerce and the 
Orange County Human Relations Commission helped establish the organization. 
</P>
<P>
The council is composed of chambers of commerce from the Latino, black, 
Vietnamese and Korean communities. It encourages members to cross cultural 
lines, promoting friendship and economic success. 
</P>
<P>
Krone, who was on a business trip in San Francisco on Thursday, said in a 
telephone interview that her goal was to encourage communication and 
cooperation among ethnically diverse business people in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
And despite the accolades, Krone is still concerned that feelings of racial 
tension and competition among Orange County minorities might damage the 
county's economic vitality. 
</P>
<P>
"A community is healthy only when local businesses are strong," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Krone has also been a member of the county's Human Relations Commission for the 
past 10 years. She was president of the Orange County Mental Health Assn. from 
1981 to 1986. And she has worked with scores of other community interest 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
But it was her work with the Minority Business Council that earned her the SBA 
recognition. The council sponsors seminars, speakers and social events that 
often cross cultural lines. 
</P>
<P>
For example, she said that members of the Vietnamese community provided 
entertainment during a Korean harvest festival in October. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to learn to be together," she said, "before we can work together." 
</P>
<P>
Chuoc Vo-Ta, executive director of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce in Orange 
County, said Krone encouraged merchants to appeal to customers from outside the 
Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
"She gives us advice," he said. "She advises people that it's time to get into 
the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
James D. McClellan, chairman of the minority business council, said Krone has 
been an inspiration to the organization and the community. 
</P>
<P>
She "lets people see there is a commonality of business objectives across all 
cultures," he said. "And that sharing of ideas allows people to work together." 
</P>
<P>
SBA spokeswoman Sandy Sutton said the eight winners will be honored in May at a 
dinner in Washington.

ENGINEERING-CONSTRUCTION UNIT POWERS IRVINE FIRM'S GAINS;

<P>
FLUOR'S QUARTERLY EARNINGS HIT $21.6 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Continuing its financial recovery, Fluor Corp. on Thursday reported earnings of 
$21.6 million for the quarter ended Jan. 31, more than double the $9 million 
recorded in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based engineering and construction giant logged revenue of $1.4 
billion for the first quarter of its 1989 fiscal year, up 37% from $1 billion 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor Chairman David Tappan Jr. attributed the improvement primarily to gains 
at Fluor Daniel, the company's principal engineering and construction unit. He 
said the company's investments in coal and lead mining operations also 
contributed to profits. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor said it won $1.6 billion in new contracts during the first quarter; the 
firm won $1.3 billion in contracts in the same period a year ago. The company's 
backlog of engineering and construction work rose to $7 billion in the quarter; 
it was $5.1 billion last year in the period. 
</P>
<P>
After 2 years of heavy losses and extensive restructuring, Fluor returned to 
profitability in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1987 and has remained in the 
black ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor has diversified its construction and engineering operations since the 
late 1970s, when its mainstay was designing and building large refineries, 
petrochemical plants and other energy-related projects. 
</P>
<P>
That work hit the skids in 1981, when oil prices began falling. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Fluor has benefited from the declining value of the dollar in 
relation to foreign currencies and from a resurgence of capital spending by 
heavy manufacturers, particularly in the pulp, paper and petrochemical 
industries.

Van Dell &amp; Associates recently announced that the firm had won a design 
award for its work on the refurbishing of John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dell said it won the Project of the Year award from the California Council

</P>
<P>
The Irvine civil engineering firm is the "V" in HPV, a consortium of three 
engineering firms supervising work at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
HPV was involved in a highly publicized flap last fall involving a $20-million 
cost overrun on the design of the new terminal. As overseers of the project, 
HPV is ultimately responsible for the overruns.

HOW PARENTS CAN HELP CHILDREN TO RESIST DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON OLDENBURG, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While prevention programs designed to get parents involved in keeping their 
children off drugs and alcohol sometimes emphasize different tactics, most 
experts concur on the following: 
</P>
<P>
* Remember you are your child's most influential role model. 
</P>
<P>
* Set the expectations, then follow through. "Be clear that you want no drug or 
alcohol use," says Lee Dogoloff of the American Council for Drug Education. 
"Tell the child what you will do if they don't meet that expectation. And then 
do it every time they don't." 
</P>
<P>
* Reinforce the message. "Children are not going to learn this the first time, 
and they need to know you are serious about it," Dogoloff says. 
</P>
<P>
* Take advantage of teachable moments. Dogoloff says parents who see an alcohol 
ad on TV might ask the child why the people in the ad all look healthy and 
athletic and are never shown hung over or vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
* Know what is going on in your child's life -- at home, at school and with 
friends. "Monitor your child's friendships," author Ken Barun says. "The No. 1 
cause of drug abuse is peer pressure. These kids need supervision." Also know 
the attitudes your child may be picking up from others -- including 
baby-sitters, camp counselors, adult family friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
* Know the parents of your child's friends. "Parents must communicate with 
other parents," PRIDE's Doug Hall says. "They need to let each other know what 
their standards are in their family." 
</P>
<P>
* Promote alternatives, Barun says. "Whether it is the inner city or affluent 
suburbia, there are worthwhile things going on -- community activities, YMCAs, 
athletics, school activities. Not TV. Boredom is one reasons kids get into 
drugs." 
</P>
<P>
* Be supportive of community anti-drug programs. "That shows your children your 
interest in the whole larger picture," NFP's Anne Meyer says. "And you have 
these messages coming from a lot of different directions -- the schools, the 
police, the media -- all in support of drug-free families." 
</P>
<P>
* Know what you are talking about when you talk about drugs. Nothing will turn 
your child off faster than if they find your information is outdated and 
incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
* Be able to recognize the signs of drug and alcohol abuse. Act if you suspect 
your child of involvement.

PARENTS ARE CALLED KEY TO DRUG-FREE CHILDREN 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 3-year-old boy gazes at a new video. From his seat on the living room couch, 
the episode looks and sounds to him a lot like Saturday morning cartoons -- 
flashy super heroes popping with super powers. 
</P>
<P>
But the stories and messages of "The Drug Avengers" bear little resemblance to 
those of the Muppett Babies or Scooby Doo: Three youngsters and an alien 
sidekick travel through time from 100 years hence to help 20th-Century 
earthlings wise up to drug abuse. The heroes in it are kids. The villains: 
pills, booze, cigarettes, dope, addiction. 
</P>
<P>
One catchy rap tune that the Avengers sing grabs the boy's attention: "A girl 
named Maggie had a little Baggie, full of something white, something didn't 
look right; she said, 'C'mon, check it out,' but I cut out instead, 'cause I 
listened to the voice inside of my head, it said, 'Uh-oh!' " 
</P>
<P>
Later, the child begs his dad to "play the uh-oh song" again. And again. The 
father asks the boy if he knows what the song is about. The boy shakes his head 
in the negative. 
</P>
<P>
When Larry Lancit and Cecily Truett say the fight to save America's children 
from drug abuse needs more super heroes, they aren't talking about animated 
ones like those in the "Avengers" video they produced. They mean parents. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to create something that would be used by kids and their parents 
together," say the husband-and-wife team whose concern for their own 5-year-old 
daughter and a grant from the U.S. Department of Education motivated them to 
create "The Drug Avengers" last year. Since then, the video, aimed at children 
from preschool to sixth grade, has been distributed to 18,000 school districts 
and now is available for home use. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for parents to get a handle on talking to their kids about drugs," 
says Lancit, whose New York company, Lancit Media Productions, maker of such 
PBS programs as "Reading Rainbow" and "Romona," co-produced this video with RNC 
Research Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea was to use entertainment as . . . a real focal point in the home for 
talking about drugs," Lancit says. "We wanted to produce something that when a 
5-minute episode is over, the child and parent could have a meaningful 
discussion." 
</P>
<P>
A Lou Harris poll on the American family recently disclosed that 9 out of 10 
parents are concerned about their children coming into contact with illicit 
drugs and alcohol. Yet, meaningful family discussion in the home about drug and 
alcohol abuse is not the norm, according to concerned experts. Most parents 
instead rely on schools to inform their children about substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Government, too, has typically bolstered police- and school-based programs, 
seldom seeing parents as a critical part of the solution. Even "The Drug 
Avengers" was created for school use and had to be revised for parents. An 
editorial piece in the New York Times 10 years ago expressed the attitude that 
has remained prevalent through much of the '80s when it contended that 
drug-abuse prevention was too important an issue "to be left in the hands of 
parents." 
</P>
<P>
But that thinking is changing. Last March, the prevention committee of the 
White House Conference for a Drug-Free America concluded that, "with the 
tremendous threat of the drug epidemic, it is vital that the first line of 
defense be the family and parents." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, experts advocate that parents take steps as early as the 
preschool years to develop the personal skills and values in their children 
needed to keep them free of drugs. Some even warn that if American parents 
don't learn to handle "drug talks" with their children better than they have 
traditionally handled "sex talks," the war on drugs may well be lost. 
</P>
<P>
"An informed parent is the best bulwark against drug use by young people," says 
Doug Hall, spokesman for the National Parent Resource Institute for Drug 
Education. Headquartered in Atlanta, the institute emerged as a maverick 
organization 12 years ago when it began proposing that parents "put themselves 
between drugs and their children." That was a time when parents intervening in 
drug problems brought to mind images of parents rifling through drawers and 
angry confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Gradual Development 
</P>
<P>
The institute's program stresses a gradual and developmental approach "that 
inculcates in the child, over many years, the family's values and standards, 
and provides techniques to avoid the problems outside the home," Hall says. The 
theory is that if parents warn children of the choices they will probably be 
asked to make, and explain the family standards, children are more likely to 
make the right decisions. The institute's surveys of children's attitudes 
indicate these discussions should take place no later than fourth grade. 
</P>
<P>
But there's an obstacle. "In many cases, today, the parent is less informed 
about drug use than children are," Hall says. "It's like the mama and papa 
telling the kid about the birds and the bees, and the child looks up and says, 
'That sounds a little like making love.' " 
</P>
<P>
Children today are drinking and taking drugs earlier than ever. Elementary 
schoolchildren, 100,000 of them, "get drunk at least once a week," according to 
the American Council for Drug Education. As early as the fourth grade, one of 
three children reports pressure from classmates to try wine coolers. One in 14 
children begins using marijuana before age 14. The average age of first use 
today has dropped to under 12. Almost a fifth of all children between 9 and 12 
have been approached to try illegal drugs, says the Media-Advertising 
Partnership for a Drug-Free America. 
</P>
<P>
Another obstacle to home-based approaches in preventing drug abuse is that most 
parents are entrenched in denial and blame. "They don't think this precious 
child of theirs would ever use drugs," says Anne Meyer, president of the 
National Federation of Parents for Drug-Free Youth, based in Deerfield, Ill. 
"So to get them interested in preventive measures is very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
The federation's program tries to debunk that myth by informing parents about 
how drugs and alcohol affect the underdeveloped bodies and growing minds of 
youngsters. "Alcohol, for instance," Meyer says, "takes 5 to 15 years for 
adults to become alcoholic. It takes less than 6 months for a child. Cocaine is 
a rapid addiction drug for adults, and much more rapid in children . . . 
interrupting the circuits in their brains and affecting their reproductive 
systems. Kids on drugs are anesthetizing themselves and missing things they 
should be developing at their age -- reasoning ability, physical growth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Action Urged 
</P>
<P>
That prospect shakes most parents into taking action. "Once they understand, 
they do what they need to do," says Meyer, who believes kindergarten is a prime 
time to get started. She recommends talking with kindergartners about their own 
bodies, about caring about themselves, about not taking things from strangers. 
Children a little older need instruction on handling peer pressure. "The actual 
drug information comes a little later, in the fourth or fifth grade," Meyer 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"But it isn't like saying, 'So now you are 9 years old and we're going to tell 
you all about drugs.' One problem is that some people give them too much too 
soon or too little too late. This is a process, not an event. This is helping 
children develop their own personal skills and build their self-esteem. But if 
you do all of that and never mention drugs, you haven't done your job as a 
parent." 
</P>
<P>
Some experts blame parents' paralysis in protecting young children from drug 
abuse on fear of not being a good parent. Does a tough stance work or drive the 
child to abuse? Is a little knowledge about drugs a dangerous thing? Lee 
Dogoloff, executive director of the American Council for Drug Education, says 
that parents learn most of what they know about parenting from what their own 
parents did with them. And that shortchanges today's parents on proper and 
effective approaches to prevent drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"This is unfamiliar territory for them," says Dogoloff, a former presidential 
adviser on drug policy. "People tend to make it more difficult than it needs to 
be. We need to think about it in terms reinforcing the message over and over 
again. Children need to know you are serious about it." 
</P>
<P>
He likens the process to teaching kids to turn off the lights when they leave a 
room. "You hear that over and over again as a child," Dogoloff says. "What you 
don't hear over and over is don't use alcohol and drugs." 
</P>
<P>
As for starting early, Dogoloff says that is critical too. "Parents need to get 
to kids at a time when they still have the credibility. For a young child, 
parents are still omnipotent, and they really do believe them." 
</P>
<P>
When Ken Barun talks to parents about their messages to children on substance 
abuse, he starts with the subtle messages communicated through actions rather 
than words. The first step for parents, he says, is to "take stock of your own 
position and addictions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Toeing the Line 
</P>
<P>
"Becoming a parent is like joining the Army -- if you don't like the sound of 
reveille and don't like crew cuts, then don't enlist," says Barun, co-author of 
"How to Keep the Children You Love Off Drugs" (The Atlantic Monthly Press: 
$12.95). "Parents have got to be responsible for their children's behavior. And 
parents need to toe the line themselves."

UNLIKELY MARY FOR 'EASTER' IN GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Typecasting it's not. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing I ever thought I'd be doing is playing the Virgin Mary," sassy 
Broadway belter Kim Criswell said of her role in "The Glory of Easter," which 
opens tonight at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," she added, sitting in her dressing room earlier this week after a 
rehearsal, "I'm not approaching this like, 'We are all in the Bible.' I'm just 
assuming I don't know that yet. If I really am this person, then I wouldn't 
know I'm in the Bible." 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly a churchgoer, Criswell figures the Crucifixion and Resurrection "is 
a seriously wild story and a great piece of theater, whether you believe it or 
not." 
</P>
<P>
She also allowed, in the faint Tennessee accent still with her from a 
Chattanooga childhood, that "maybe it is a true story, because nobody could 
have thought up something that wild." 
</P>
<P>
Seen last season in Opera Pacific's "Kismet" at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center -- she played Lalume, the royal trash of Baghdad -- Criswell is 
best known for her starring role in the Los Angeles production of "Cats" that 
ran at the Shubert Theatre in the mid-'80s. As old Grizabella, the wizened 
alley trash of the Heaviside Layer, she sang Andrew Lloyd Weber's nostalgic 
anthem, "Memories," every night for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Though her progression from "Cats" to "Kismet" to the Crystal Cathedral may 
seem surprising, it does have a certain logic, if only because of the 
accelerating decline of musical theater in New York, where the irrepressible 
and irreverent stage actress has made her home since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so few shows, you can't earn a living there anymore -- at least not 
the kind I need," said Criswell, whose Broadway credits include featured roles 
in "Nine," "Baby," "Stardust" and "The First," as well as the national touring 
company of "Annie" and top regional revivals. 
</P>
<P>
This lackluster season, for instance, the musicals that opened on Broadway can 
be counted on one hand: "Carrie," "Legs Diamond," "Black and Blue" and "Jerome 
Robbins' Broadway." The first two were disasters, closing soon after their 
premieres. The third has managed to remain open. And the fourth, which is the 
only bona fide hit, is a compendium of highlights from 20 years of musicals 
from 1944 to 1964. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed the auditions for the Robbins show, so it's like I'm out for the 
year," Criswell said. "That's why I came back to Los Angeles -- to do the (TV) 
pilot season. I'm trying to get into film and television work. Musical theater 
has become a dead-end trip." 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't help that this red-haired Southerner, 31, finds herself competing 
for starring roles time and again against established "name" stars whose 
marquee values carry the kind of weight that New York producers require before 
they risk millions of dollars on today's mega-musicals. 
</P>
<P>
"It happens every time," she said. "It's always between me and a name. And I'm 
never going to win that, not the way it is now. It doesn't matter what I do in 
the audition if they want a name. 
</P>
<P>
"For 'Anything Goes,' it was between me and Patti Lupone. For 'Sunday in the 
Park' and 'Into the Woods,' it was between me and Bernadette Peters. For 'Cats' 
it was between me and Betty Buckley. Judy Kaye is another one. Our paths cross 
a lot. It's getting a little silly. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless all of these girls decide to take a vacation somewhere -- together -- 
I'm not going to get the parts that I'm right for," Criswell said. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing she would be coming West and would need to tide herself over, Criswell 
tried out for "The Glory of Easter" in October in New York, where she said many 
of the pageant's leading players were cast (including Jonathan Fuller, who 
stars as Jesus). 
</P>
<P>
"When I went into the audition, I didn't know quite what to expect," she said. 
"Back there, they sort of think of the Crystal Cathedral as Radio City West. I 
guess it's because Radio City (Music Hall) has a Christmas show with live 
animals and special effects, just like here. This place obviously has many more 
religious overtones. I've noticed that. But I'm happy to be here." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Criswell sees significant parallels between what she did in "Cats" 
and what she is expected to do in "The Glory of Easter." The common 
denominator, she said, is the anguish that must be evoked in both performances, 
although one was secular and the other is religious. "As Mary, I don't have 
many lines, but there's a lot of hysteria," she pointed out. "It's really like 
Grizabella. All I did as Grizabella was have 'a hissy fit.' Every night I had a 
nervous breakdown, which is basically what I'm doing here. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly, I thought all I would do as the Virgin Mary was stand there and 
look pretty and sing a song. Now it's true that I don't go on until the last 20 
minutes of the show, but when I do it is full-tilt boogie." 
</P>
<P>
A 1979 graduate of the Cincinnati Conservatory, Criswell worked professionally 
on stage long before she got out of high school. At 15, she recalled, she was 
starring in shows at Six Flags Over Georgia, an amusement park near Atlanta, 
while her classmates "were dipping ice cream cones at Baskin-Robbins." 
</P>
<P>
The first time she sang in public she was not even old enough for elementary 
school. "My parents stood me on a box at church," Criswell said, "and I think I 
sang 'Ave Maria.' I didn't know that was weird for a 5-year-old. I had this 
strange adult voice. I never did sound like a kid." 
</P>
<P>
While Criswell's singing is her greatest claim to fame, she has misgivings that 
it "has become a trap," because casting directors "assume singers in the 
musical theater can't act." 
</P>
<P>
Still, she maintains a busy schedule of pop concerts. Last weekend, for 
instance, she was a guest artist with the Vancouver Symphony, singing an 
evening's worth of tunes from the Rodgers &amp; Hart songbook. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, she is trying to build a theatrical recording career. Twice 
featured on original cast albums -- "Baby" and "Nine" -- she recently recorded 
Cole Porter's "Anything Goes" with the London Symphony. It is due out in the 
fall on Angel-EMI Records. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm Reno Sweeney," Criswell said. "Frederica von Stade is Hope. Jack Gilford 
is Moon Face. It's great. I got to sing the starring role, and I'm the only 
person on the record I've never heard of." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Glory of Easter" continues through March 26 at the Crystal Cathedral, 
12141 Lewis St., Garden Grove. Performances nightly at 6:30 and 8:30 p.m., 
except Monday. Tickets: $14 to $25. Information: (714) 544-5679.

TOXIC PLANT PROFILE: LANTANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANTANA (Lantana camara): A native of tropical America, lantana (sometimes 
called red sage or yellow sage) is cultivated widely in Southern California. 
The shrubby plant grows to 6 feet tall and has small orange or yellow to red 
flowers that grow in a flat-topped head about 2 inches wide. All parts of the 
plant are toxic to humans, causing gastrointestinal irritation, muscular 
weakness, lethargy and circulatory collapse if eaten or swallowed.

SINGLE LIFE: NON-GRANDPARENTS IRKED BY THEIR OFFSPRING WHO REMAIN CHILDLESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN, Susan Christian is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Margy Kleinerman reached the ripe old age of 21, an aunt admonished her to 
"grab anything" she could get. She was, after all, well on her way to becoming 
a spinster. 
</P>
<P>
She married at 26 -- late, by '50s standards. Two years later, she and her 
husband, Joseph Kleinerman, started producing babies. 
</P>
<P>
Today, those babies all have passed their mother's matrimonial milestone: Mark 
is 34, Stephanie is 33 and Brady is 27. But times have changed. None of the 
Kleinermans' brood feels under pressure to wed, much less propagate -- except, 
that is, for the pressure their parents apply. 
</P>
<P>
"I hint constantly to my three adult children. I save the singles activities 
from various publications and encourage my children to attend," Margy 
Kleinerman, of Brea, wrote in a letter to Single Life. "They reply that they 
cannot get married just to fulfill my need to become a grandparent. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I see a baby, I ooh and coo and wish I were able to share in the 
fun and pleasures of seeing the world as it can only be seen through the eyes 
of a young child. I would like the joy of buying toys for any and all 
occasions. I would like to celebrate traditional holidays and teach my 
grandchildren about their heritage. I would like to do all this before the 
infirmities of old age catch up with me." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph and Margy Kleinerman seem like prototypal grandparents -- silver-haired, 
gracious and doting. Their home looks like a place that grandparents would 
inhabit -- spacious, yet cozy, and walls lined with family photos of every 
generation but the next. 
</P>
<P>
With both amusement and understanding, daughter Stephanie Kleinerman chats 
unselfconsciously about her parents' desire that she "settle down." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see many marriages working, anyway," Stephanie said. "Every time I 
turn around, another friend is getting a divorce. I've quit buying personalized 
wedding presents." 
</P>
<P>
Her mother, who is 62, said that "When I tell my children I'd like to see them 
get married, they throw back at me all the cliches I used on them: 'You always 
told us to wait until the right person comes along.' 
</P>
<P>
"I taught them to be cautious, and now I'm afraid that they're not making any 
concessions at all." 
</P>
<P>
Although he lets his wife do most of the complaining, Joseph Kleinerman, 64, 
said he is as eager as she is to hear once again the patter of little feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed my children very much," he said. "I didn't even mind getting up in 
the middle of the night with them. I'd like for them, too, to experience the 
pleasures of children." 
</P>
<P>
Both of the Kleinermans enjoy children so much, in fact, that before retiring 
they were schoolteachers. But their offspring, all sales managers, directed 
their goals with a different focus. 
</P>
<P>
"I have mixed emotions about children," Stephanie admitted. "They're wonderful 
if returnable. Often I'll think, 'Gosh, I'm glad that's not my kid who just 
broke that porcelain vase.' " 
</P>
<P>
Until -- and unless -- their children cooperate and provide them with 
grandbabies, the Kleinermans can only imagine the phase of life that they are 
missing. "We'd be such good grandparents," Joseph Kleinerman lamented. "Since 
we're retired, we'd have time to baby-sit. We could take the children to 
Disneyland, to the park. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
If it is any solace to them, the Kleinermans are far from unique in their 
longer-than-anticipated wait for grandchildren. As millions of baby boom 
products and their younger siblings delay parenthood for education and careers, 
they in turn suspend their parents' grandparenthood. 
</P>
<P>
For many older parents, that suspension will be a permanent one. A 1987 U.S. 
Census Bureau report on fertility put the proportion of childless Americans 
aged 30 to 34 at 23.6%, up 8 points from 1976's figure of 15.6%. In those 11 
years, the 35-to-39 age bracket rose from 10.5% to 16.7%. And the slice of 
childless Americans over 40 increased from 10.2% to 14.2%. 
</P>
<P>
The deferring -- or forgoing -- of grandparenthood is not always an easy 
adjustment. "Older people want to see the perpetuation of their family," said 
Laguna Hills psychiatrist Irwin Rosenfeld, whose practice centers on 
geriatrics. 
</P>
<P>
"As you become older, you get a sense of your own mortality; friends are 
developing health problems and dying," added Rosenfeld, president of the Orange 
County Psychiatric Society. "A grandchild is like a rebirth -- here is a part 
of you that will live forever." 
</P>
<P>
Also, grandchildren offer reassurance to older people that their children will 
have fulfilled, secure lives. "When children follow the traditional course, it 
is a source of gratification for their parents," said Robert Pfeffer, UC Irvine 
associate professor of neurology, who specializes in problems of the aged. 
"Throughout recorded history, children growing up and having children of their 
own has been the 'normal' expectation. 
</P>
<P>
"Often, parents of childless adults feel that something in their children's 
lives is incomplete -- and tend to regard them as children rather than as 
adults." 
</P>
<P>
Ask Steven and Elaine Brody about their grandchildren. They'll give you an 
earful -- because they don't have any, and they're mad as heck about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to win the lottery this weekend, and I'm not going to share it with 
any of my kids unless they have children," Steven Brody, 62, proclaimed 
half-seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Hills couple have a married daughter, 40, a married son, 35, and a 
divorced son, 37. And not a one in the whole bunch seems interested in 
procreation. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, all five of them -- the two in-laws, too -- are very immature and 
selfish," said Elaine Brody, 60. "They tell us, 'Why have children? We can pick 
up and go skiing whenever we want.' But they're missing out on a lot. I don't 
think you become mature until you have to sacrifice for your children." 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband so adore little ones that, in the past, when their sons 
dated divorced women with children, they were enthusiastic baby-sitters. "I 
talk to kids every chance I get," said Brody, a retired salesman. "In the 
doctor's office, in malls, in parks -- I stop and tease them. I love all kids 
-- except for my own (because) they've cheated some children out of some good 
grandparents." 
</P>
<P>
So, go ahead, ask them about their grandchildren. But whatever you do, don't 
tell them about your own. "I don't want to hear about other people's 
grandchildren. I don't want to see pictures of them," Elaine Brody said. "Yes, 
indeed, I'm envious." 
</P>
<P>
Rest assured that grandparenting is not going out of style. A hefty 90% of 
older people in the United States with children over the age of 40 are 
grandparents, although that figure is expected to decline somewhat over the 
next couple of decades.

If you're looking for fun and an opportunity to yell and scream and don your 
cowboy boots and hats, consider making a trek to the annual San Juan Capistrano 
Team Penning Competition on Saturday and Sunday at the Ortega Equestrian 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being a fun community event, the proceeds from the competition benefit 
the Orange County Riding Center, a therapeutic horseback riding program for the 
development of physically dependent children and adults, and Renee Lacouague, a 
native of San Juan Capistrano and teacher at San Clemente High School. 
</P>
<P>
"Renee . . . was left a quadriplegic in 1988 after an accident," said Dee Dee 
Gates, manager and founder of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
Team penning is a competition that evolved from the everyday work of a ranching 
operation when cattle are gathered for market and the yearlings and calves have 
to be separated from the cows and run into separate holding pens. 
</P>
<P>
Reined cow horses are used in the event. According to Nadine Symons, founder of 
the Southern California Reined Cow Horse Assn., "A reined cow horse is a horse 
. . . that has been trained to work cattle as well as perform a routine." 
</P>
<P>
A reined cow horse is trained to slide-stop, spin a full circle both to the 
right and left like a top and gallop a large figure eight with correct lead 
changes at the center of the figure eight. 
</P>
<P>
"A lead change means that if a horse is galloping or cantering to the right on 
a circle, his right front and hind legs lead first, thus allowing him to 
maintain balance," Symons said. "As he changes direction and circles to the 
left, the transition to the left lead should be smooth. The horse must also 
back in a straight line on cue without hesitation." 
</P>
<P>
In team penning competition, Gates said, "30 head of cattle are grouped at the 
far end of the arena." The cattle are numbered so that sets of three have the 
same number. At the signal a three-man team rides toward the herd and is 
assigned a number. The team members cut out the three cattle with their numbers 
and drive them to the opposite end of the arena into a small pen. Two minutes 
is allowed to pen the cattle. 
</P>
<P>
"We have team competitions for juniors, ladies, open and even an 'Old Timers' 
where the team members' combined ages are 165 years or more," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
The free event begins at 9 a.m. both days at the Equestrian Center, 27252 Calle 
Arroyo. For information, call (714) 661-3130.

The last few paragraphs of an article about the sentencing of former Los 
Angeles Police Officer Robert Von Villas were omitted from some copies 
Thursday. Von Villas was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of 
parole for the contract killing of a Northridge businessman. 
</P>
<P>
The missing part of the story quoted Von Villas as saying he believed jurors 
were prejudiced against him because of information they had received outside 
the courtroom, including his prior conviction for robbing a jewelry store and 
attempting to murder an exotic dancer to collect on a life insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
It said Von Villas' attorneys attempted to question two former jurors who 
invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to testify. In denying a motion for a 
new trial, Judge Darlene E. Schempp ruled that jurors who convicted Von Villas 
were not influenced by that knowledge or any other information they received 
outside the courtroom.

mathematics, economics, science, language, literature and fine arts in 
Bakersfield today as they defend their title of Academic Decathlon champions 
against 44 teams from around the state. If they win the grueling 2 1/2-day 
state competition -- which includes personal interviews, essay writing, 
prepared and impromptu speeches and oral quizzes -- they will compete in the 
national championships in Rhode Island next month. After winning the state 
championships last year, the Taft team came in second place at the national 
competition.

Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran said today that the only way to 
quiet Muslim furor over the novel "The Satanic Verses" is to burn all copies of 
the book and ban it forever. 
</P>
<P>
"If it stays, it will remain forever a source of rebellion and it would be 
impossible that peace would come between real Muslims and the supporters of 
this book," the official IRNA news agency quoted him as saying. "The only 
solution that exists . . . is to issue a strict order to seize all copies in 
the world and burn it," Rafsanjani said. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made his latest remarks about the book at the weekly mass prayer

Former National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane told a jury today that top 
Reagan Administration officials discussed whether arranging third-country aid 
to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels was an illegal act for which the President 
could be impeached. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying at Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial, McFarlane said then-White House 
chief of staff James A. Baker III took the position at the June 25, 1984, 
meeting of the National Security Planning Group that it is illegal to solicit 
third-country aid. 
</P>
<P>
"I took it to mean . . . that if the President were to authorize . . . money 
from third countries that would be a violation of law and he could therefore be 
so charged and impeached . . . removed from office," McFarlane said. Members of 
the planning group included then-President Reagan, Vice President Bush and 
secretaries of state and defense. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane recalled that Baker's view was "strongly countered" and that the 
consensus from the meeting was that Baker's opinion was "not true." 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia that year began giving the Contras $1 million a month. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor John Keker asked McFarlane whether top Reagan Administration 
officials were being asked to lie to Congress about the secret third-country 
aid. McFarlane said the intent was "just not to have" the matter "become 
public." 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane said the Administration decided to seek help for the rebels from 
other countries because it did not wish to become involved in a messy political 
fight with Congress by seeking additional Contra aid in an election year. 
</P>
<P>
"The American people don't like violence," McFarlane said in regard to the war 
the Contras were waging against the leftist Nicaraguan government. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a public relations consultant who moved money to the Contras 
testified at the U.S. District Court trial that North approved taking a 10% cut 
from private donations to the rebel cause. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Miller said North told him at the end of 1985 that "most of the people 
involved" in the fund-raising network were "getting 20% to 30%." 
</P>
<P>
Miller also told how he asked the former White House aide for lists of 
"big-ticket items" the Contras needed that would be "comprehensible" to 
potential contributors.

BRADY UNVEILS NEW FOREIGN DEBT STRATEGY;

ADMINISTRATION PLAN STRESSES FORGIVENESS TO SETTLE WORLD CRISIS

The Bush Administration, responding to growing instability in Latin American 
countries straining under heavy debt loads, today unveiled a new strategy 
emphasizing debt forgiveness to deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The new approach was outlined in a major policy address by Treasury Secretary 
Nicholas F. Brady, who called for a "great cooperative effort" among all 
nations to resolve the debt crisis that has occupied the world for the last 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to rekindle the hope of the people and leaders of debtor 
nations that their sacrifices will lead to greater prosperity in the present 
and the prospect of a future unclouded by the burden of debt," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
Three hundred people were killed last week in rioting in Venezuela sparked 
after the government announced new austerity measures aimed at satisfying 
international creditors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Response to Critics 
</P>
<P>
The Administration plan is a response to critics both in debtor nations and 
major industrialized countries who have been calling on the United States to go 
beyond the debt policies of the Reagan Administration and then-Treasury 
Secretary James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called Baker plan, unveiled in October, 1985, rejected the idea of 
broad-based efforts to forgive debt, focusing instead on increased lending to 
debtor nations. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Baker plan, the new Bush proposal endorses voluntary efforts on the 
part of commercial banks to forgive part of the $400 billion they are owed by 
the largest debtor countries, many of them in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage the banks to forgive the debt, the Administration called on the 
151-nation World Bank and its sister organization, the International Monetary 
Fund, to help provide guarantees for the remaining debt owed by the poor 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Quite Substantial' Reduction 
</P>
<P>
A Treasury Department official, briefing reporters under ground rules that did 
not allow the use of his name, said the Administration believes that the new 
approach will provide a "quite substantial" reduction in both the debt burden 
and annual interest payments required of debtor countries. 
</P>
<P>
However, the official refused to provide specifics about how much of the $400 
billion in debt held by middle-income countries such as Brazil, Mexico and 
Venezuela would be forgiven under the approach. 
</P>
<P>
While initial reaction was generally favorable to the Brady proposal, former 
Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker, who also spoke at the debt 
conference, cautioned against looking for a single "magic elixir" to solve the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"If not well-managed, a process of debt reduction clearly could be hazardous to 
the health of debtors and creditors alike," Volcker said in a speech before 
Brady's appearance.

NO SELLOUT IN U.S.-JAPANESE F-16 DEAL, CARLUCCI ASSERTS

Former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci told a congressional panel today 
that the Pentagon did not sell out U.S. economic interests in agreeing to 
transfer to Japan technology for building an advanced version of the F-16 
fighter. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my judgment that the FSX represents a good deal for Japan, a good deal 
for the United States and an excellent deal for the U.S.-Japan security and 
industrial relationship," Carlucci told a Senate Armed Services subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
He asserted that "in the end, much of the criticism of the FSX deal reflects an 
irrational fear of Japan's technological prowess." 
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, St. Louis-based General Dynamics would join forces with Japan's 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to co-develop and co-produce a next-generation 
fighter, called the FSX, for deployment by Japan in the late 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents argue that the agreement represents the best deal the United States 
could negotiate in the face of Japanese opposition to buying F-16s directly 
from the United States. They say the deal will serve to promote beneficial 
technology transfer in both directions while generating income and jobs for 
U.S. industry. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, contend that the arrangement amounts to a giveaway of 
advanced technology that Japan may use to help propel its civilian aircraft 
industry into head-to-head competition with the United States in the world 
market. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of congressional criticism, the Bush Administration has been 
conducting an interagency review of the FSX deal before sending the agreement 
to Capitol Hill.

KENTUCKY U PROBES GIFT OF $20,000 TO ASST. COACHES

Kentucky basketball coach Eddie Sutton employed help from a friend in raising 
$20,000 in outside income for two assistant coaches, a possible violation of 
NCAA rules, the university has reported to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
The Louisville Courier-Journal reported in today's editions it had obtained a 
portion of the university's response to 18 NCAA charges of rules violations, a 
response which has not been made public. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton and assistant coaches Dwane Casey and James Dickey contend the outside 
income was not a violation, but "the university does not agree" with that 
interpretation, the response said. 
</P>
<P>
After Casey and Dickey were turned down for raises by then-Athletic Director 
Cliff Hagan during the 1987-88 season, Sutton told the pair he would attempt to 
raise the money from outside sources, the response said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither assistant coach reported the outside income to the NCAA because they 
said it was not athletic-related income and therefore not subject to NCAA 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Triggered by Discovery 
</P>
<P>
The information was gathered as part of a university investigation of the 
program ordered by David Roselle, Kentucky's president, after a package bound 
for a Los Angeles-area recruit containing $1,000 in cash was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
The response said Sutton used an unidentified "friend and booster of the 
university's basketball program" to solicit $10,000 each for Casey and Dickey 
from two unidentified businessmen who are supporters of the Kentucky program. 
The money reportedly was for motivational speeches.
