LIMBAUGH'S OPINIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Rick Du Brow's "Radio's Limbaugh Brings His Opinions to TV," March 3: Rush 
Limbaugh is popular because he says things that really bother people and no one 
else in the media says it. For example, the excesses of black politicians who 
break laws and are not criticized in the press for fear of being labeled 
racist. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he speaks out against the lack of criticism when there is blatant 
behavior on the part of gays, feminists and liberal Democrats (while 
Republicans are fair game for criticism). He decries communism and the fact 
that the press has just now got around to thinking it's unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
But Rush is not altogether good. He is a self-aggrandizing adolescent who 
spends most of his show telling you how wonderful he is, selling his 
videotapes, playing terrible music, pushing his pet causes and telling about 
women who try to pick him up on airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
The reason he has an audience is those few moments when he expresses the 
majority's real opinion. It's like a voice in the wilderness.

YOSEMITE: THE CURRY CO. DESERVES CREDIT FOR ITS MANAGEMENT OF THE VALLEY. NOW, 
IF WE CAN JUST GET THE CARS OUT. . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. BROWER, David R. Brower's autobiography, For Earth's Sake: The Life 
and Times of David Brower, (Gibbs Smith, Inc.) will be formally published on 
Earth Day, April 22. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The periodic assault on Yosemite guardians has gone on long enough. Gnats are 
being strained at concerning Yosemite management while we in California as a 
whole swallow camels -- the spoiling of our waters offshore and on, the 
reckless destruction of our forests and the apparent preference for gridlock 
over clean air and acid-free rain. More camels will be identified on request. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 72 years I have been visiting Yosemite. I worked there year-round 
from 1935 to 1938, was fired by the Yosemite Park and Curry Co. for not being a 
good enough publicity manager, helped draft the Sierra Club's national park 
policy, was dubbed John Muir reincarnate by Stephen R. Fox in his book "John 
Muir and His Legacy: The American Conservation Movement," and helped establish 
six additions to the national park system and keep dams out of three of them. I 
care a lot about national parks. 
</P>
<P>
With all this behind me, I now wish the Curry Co. were receiving the bouquets 
it merits instead of the bricks it doesn't deserve. 
</P>
<P>
There were about 37,000 other visitors when I first visited Yosemite Valley in 
1918. Twenty years later, when I stopped working there, the count almost hit 
half a million. Last year there were six times that many and the valley looked 
better and was more enjoyable than it had been half a century earlier. The 
impact of visitors upon the valley has been lessened and the impact of the 
valley upon the visitors has been enhanced. 
</P>
<P>
That is the prize we need to keep our eye on. It needs to continue. The Curry 
Co. deserves much of the credit. Much of it has been the result of the 
company-run shuttle system that has allowed the Happy Isles and Mirror Lake 
regions, which were extensive parking lots, to be restored into something 
approaching their original beauty and serenity. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean that you can escape people in those areas. If that is your 
goal in Yosemite, it is understandable. And there are plenty of places in 
Yosemite Valley where you can escape, although I won't list them, lest the 
crowd beat you to them. 
</P>
<P>
I enjoy watching people enjoy Yosemite, looking at their faces, the wonder in 
them, the variety of their ages and origins. They are having their chance to 
know one of the world's most beautiful places, at all hours and in all seasons. 
Their very numbers, through the years, have provided the political force to 
keep most of Yosemite National Park one of the best-preserved places on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
In the valley itself, keep an eye on how the natural scenery has been little 
affected by the facilities built to serve the visiting lovers of Yosemite and 
the lovers of Yosemite who serve them. 
</P>
<P>
What we need to worry most about in Yosemite is the auto. Let the National Park 
Service's bold General Management Plan count on an early departure. The Century 
of Oil brought the cars. Sooner or later in the next century the cars will be 
starved of fuel and the people will have the valley back. 
</P>
<P>
Let's hurry that day by restoring the Yosemite Valley Rail Road (that's the way 
they spelled it before the great flood of Dec. 11, 1937, took it apart). It was 
a great ride, worry-free, up the beautiful Merced River Canyon. And remember 
that railroads helped establish the national parks in the first place. Restored 
railroads can help protect them for people -- and from cars. 
</P>
<P>
Visit the valley in an off-season, when cars are few, and see for yourself how 
worthwhile an investment the restoration of the railroad would be when it gives 
us a chance to tie private automobiles outside. 
</P>
<P>
While we're at it, let's restore the Hetch Hetchy Valley, keep it free of 
private cars, and let it share Yosemite admirers. If Los Angeles can find ways 
to get by with less hydroelectric power from Mono Lake's streams, San Francisco 
can certainly get by with less power from the Tuolumne River. Unlike Los 
Angeles, San Francisco will get more water in the bargain! Water will no longer 
evaporate from a reservoir-free Hetch Hetchy. There is plenty of storage space 
in Don Pedro reservoir, down at the 800-foot level on the Tuolumne River, where 
water is diverted to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
What should we do with the O'Shaughnessy Dam? The Army Corps of Engineers 
should enjoy the task of dismantling it. With the Berlin Wall as a precedent, 
pieces of the Hetch Hetchy dam could be sold to tourists as mementos. Invest 
the revenue in the Yosemite railroad. 
</P>
<P>
To sum up: Let the Yosemite master plan phase private automobiles out and phase 
rail and more shuttle service in. A few further accommodations, as superbly 
planned as those at Yosemite Lodge, can be fitted in nearby. If a few 
corporations convene there in the off-season, it could be good for slipping a 
little ecological conscience into the corporate soul. Let the people who serve 
visitors live where they work, not a multimile commute away. Let Yosemite's 
beauty remain part of their reward. Be grateful for the company that manages 
the wonderful shuttle system, that has driven Styrofoam out of the valley, that 
has long been recycling beverage containers and is now recycling 
chlorofluorocarbons while keeping prices lower than you will find in equivalent 
tourist meccas in San Francisco or Los Angeles. It is a company run by people 
who care about Yosemite and stay there long enough to learn how to protect it 
well. It is a company I own no stock in. Remember, they fired me. 
</P>
<P>
Generous credit is deserved by the Yosemite people, government and company, who 
have been masters of restoration. Try, for example, to find traces of the Old 
Village, the Sentinel Hotel, Cedar Cottage, the Ahwahnee golf course, the 
highway across the Ahwahnee Meadow, the Big Oak Flat Road, the old Wawona Road 
or the overjammed campgrounds of the past. Yosemite people deserve to toast, 
not a roast. 
</P>
<P>
If they annually serve 3 million visitors so well and protect the park so well 
that the company makes a lot of money, don't curse them. Profit is still legal. 
Persuade them to invest some of it in more shuttles, a railroad, developing 
smogless fuel for campers and distributing souvenir fragments of Hetch Hetchy's 
evil dam. If there is too much profit after all that, renegotiate! 
</P>
<P>
Anyone for a cease-fire while we stop straining at gnats and swallowing camels 
and get about the task of restoring precious bits of California?

FEMINISM REIGNS IN PARADISE; 
</P>
<P>
SEX: TROPICAL BIRDS HAVE A LESSON FOR HUMANS: THE UP-TO-DATE FEMALE HAS LITTLE 
USE FOR A MALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By C. M. DEASY, C.M. Deasy is an architect and writer in San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New studies in the jungles of New Guinea have revealed a link between economics 
and mating behavior that foretells a major change in human parenting. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bruce M. Beehler, the Smithsonian zoologist who reported his findings in 
the December issue of Scientific American, doesn't actually say that they will 
apply to human beings, but male-female relationships in the urban jungle are 
not much different from what he observed. While his subject is the flamboyant 
bird of paradise, given Nature's habit of dealing with similar problems in 
similar ways, it's clear that the man on the street faces some stunning 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
The facts are simple. There are several kinds of birds of paradise. The male of 
the raggiana species is the exotic member of the clan, with a brilliant yellow 
cap, a blue bill and magnificent orange flank plumes. The female raggiana is 
not as colorful. In contrast, in the manucode species both sexes are much 
alike, conservatively dressed in drab but serviceable plumage. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are the manucodes conservative in dress; their marital fidelity is 
exemplary. The male manucode is much like the American husband and father, 
faithful, trustworthy, reliable, sharing with his mate the responsibilities of 
parenthood. The male raggiana is, in contrast, a cad. He takes no 
responsibility for anything. He hangs out with his pals in a favorite tree, 
displaying his plumage and calling to passing females. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting of male and female raggiana happens in an atmosphere not too 
different from the average singles bar. When a female ventures into the 
all-male group, or "lek," the males go into a frenzy of activity, hopping back 
and forth, hanging upside down and squawking raucously. The female seems little 
impressed. Surrounded by male magnificence, she has the distant look of someone 
paused in a supermarket aisle weighing the virtues of competing brands of 
detergent. Once she makes her selection, the nuptials are over in an instant 
and she flies away to her nest, lays her egg and never looks back. 
</P>
<P>
In view of the radical difference in the way the manucode and the raggiana 
species approach family matters, the inevitable question is, what genetic quirk 
could have caused the male raggiana's irresponsible behavior? Beehler's 
research comes up with an alarming answer: The difference in behavior between 
male manucode and male raggiana has nothing to do with character, morality or 
early childhood nurturing. It results solely from the status of the female and 
the life style she has adopted. 
</P>
<P>
It starts with technology. Mom and Dad Manucode are still operating at the 
wooden plow level of development. They are only capable of harvesting soft 
fruits, which are plentiful but not very nutritious. As a consequence, it takes 
both of them working full time to gather enough food to nourish their young. If 
Dad doesn't bring home his share of the groceries, there won't be any 
offspring. Mom and Dad Raggiana, by contrast, have developed high-tech 
harvesting. Their bills are adapted to pry insects out of bark and crack hard 
seed shells, providing a much richer diet, higher in fat and protein. 
</P>
<P>
With this technology and the superior economic base it provides, the female 
raggiana can take care of her offspring all by herself. Given that 
independence, who needs a male hanging around, particularly one who squawks a 
lot and spends his time hanging upside down displaying his feathers? 
</P>
<P>
The Beehler report's implication for the human species is obvious -- and 
alarming. Our technology has virtually eliminated the difference in physical 
capabilities between men and women; women can do almost any job men can do. 
This is resulting in women's growing economic power and independence. With the 
ability to care for their offspring alone, how long will women want to share 
space with a non-essential male, regardless of how ornamental he might be? The 
human male could wind up like the raggiana male, showy but irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
Some men might like that. Some men might be willing to forgo the joys of 
parenting, happy to trade night feedings and Little League for some jungle 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
But before anyone takes the plunge and signs on with his local lek, there is 
something else he should know. Dr. Beehler has spent long hours observing the 
mating activities in the lek (zoologists seem to know no shame), and he reports 
that there is no such thing as fair shares for all. A few males dominate, and 
in some cases one male may attract nine out of ten of the females. So lek life 
is not all fun and games. In some ways, it's just high school all over again.

TEACHING STUDENTS BETTER LESSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone looking for no-cost, low-tech, frills-free and, most of all, effective 
ways to make education better would do well to consider a new Harvard 
University study on how students learn. 
</P>
<P>
The three-year study found that modest changes in teaching and studying methods 
can produce real improvements in learning. For example, students who are asked 
at the end of each class to write a one-minute paper on "the big point you 
learned today" and "the main unanswered question you still have" benefit from 
having to think about the course's central themes and organize their thoughts. 
Teachers benefit, too, from the feedback on how their ideas are getting across. 
</P>
<P>
The study further found that students learned the most when they were given 
periodic quizzes and regularly required to write reports and make oral 
presentations. They learned more when given the chance to rewrite a term paper 
after a teacher had read and commented on it, and found that taking part in 
outside study groups of up to six people was a more effective way to learn than 
hitting the books in lonely isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Such ideas are anything but new. Frequent tests to measure progress in, say, 
math and foreign-language classes are a staple of teaching. And many teachers 
demand frequent written reports and quizzes. But what's particularly intriguing 
about the Harvard study is that its findings have a relevance that clearly 
extends beyond higher education: The approaches in teaching and studying that 
the report describes can be applied through most of the school years. Best of 
all, in this age of tight budgets, here are some ideas to improve learning and 
teaching skills that don't require new schools or classrooms, expensive new 
laboratories or special equipment, or bigger staffs. 
</P>
<P>
What's needed, on the part of students and teachers alike, is a commitment to 
work a little harder each week. If the Harvard study is right, the payoff could 
be considerable.

WHY ISRAEL NEEDS THOSE MISSILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A paradox: An economically ailing Soviet Union moves to drastically cut its aid 
to clients around the world. Syria, a major recipient of that bounty and a 
fierce proponent of the Arab hard line, is shaken by word from Moscow that it 
had better forget about trying to achieve strategic parity with Israel. All 
this seems to indicate an easing of the military threat Israel faces. Suddenly, 
though, the Pentagon reveals that it plans to transfer an advanced anti-missile 
system to Israel on an emergency basis. Why? Because even as the Cold War 
withers away, a significant new threat to the Middle East's fragile military 
balance has emerged. 
</P>
<P>
The portents came late in the Iran-Iraq war, when the two belligerents launched 
deadly ballistic missile attacks against each other's civilian populations. The 
vulnerability of cities was brutally demonstrated. Since then, both countries 
have pushed missile acquisition, with Iraq bragging that it has developed its 
own 1,250-mile-range weapon. Syria, Iraq's bitter ideological foe, has 
stockpiled Soviet-supplied missiles and is getting help from China and North 
Korea to improve their range and accuracy. Egypt and Libya have 
ground-to-ground missiles; so does Saudi Arabia. Israel has test-fired its own 
930-mile-range weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that the Middle East is suddenly bristling with weapons able to 
carry high-explosive, chemical or even nuclear warheads. Because so many 
countries are now involved in the transfer of ballistic missile technology -- 
France, West Germany, Brazil and Argentina are among them -- the superpowers 
have only limited ability to restrain further proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
The justifiable U.S. decision to supply Israel with the anti-missile Patriot 
system and related early-warning satellite information on an urgent basis 
indicates how seriously the threat to an ally is being assessed. The strategic 
threat, though, isn't limited to Israel alone. It now hovers over the entire 
region, fueling tensions and raising the risks of fresh conflict.

CRIPPLED TRAUMA SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Closure of the first teaching hospital trauma center firmly seals the coffin's 
lid on an essential health-care service for San Gabriel Valley residents. The 
decision to close the trauma center at the Huntington Memorial Hospital shows a 
total lack of appreciation and consideration for important patient-care issues. 
</P>
<P>
In these days of cost controls and corporate medicine financial concerns, who 
is left to worry about patient care? If physicians and hospitals do not take up 
this cause, the whole system will collapse. Never should concern for payments 
be put above patient care. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Hospital has been an excellent teaching hospital for many years. It 
chose to be an institution for medical education, rather than just another 
community hospital. As a teaching hospital, it is expected to instill reliable 
and trustworthy value systems to its young physicians, yet by choosing to 
remove itself from the trauma center network, it reinforces the idea that 
dollars should take precedence over delivery of care. This kind of conduct if 
allowed to persist threatens the public safety. 
</P>
<P>
Trauma centers are essential health services which lower death rates without 
question. Allowing the entire San Gabriel Valley to not have a trauma center 
jeopardizes the health of everyone living there. 
</P>
<P>
A teaching hospital with such high responsibility should have reached a more 
reasonable and fair solution. Downscaling or accepting less trauma runs would 
help lower its financial exposure, while at the same time satisfying its 
societal obligation as a health-care institution. This disastrous and fatal 
blow must be met with an equally strong counterblow. First, county and state 
officials need to obtain a restraining order preventing the closure of this 
essential public service. Failure to achieve this is a real danger to the 
health of every resident in San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, if the hospital persists in its trauma closure, then its status as a 
teaching institution should be removed. We cannot allow institutions of medical 
education to hold hostage the public's well-being. 
</P>
<P>
We are all potential patients of trauma centers. Continued closure of these 
health services only further increase needless deaths due to accidental 
injuries.

<P>
Considering the Department of Health and Human Services report (Part A, Feb. 
21) that tobacco kills 400,000 Americans each year and costs the nation more 
than $52 billion annually in health care and productivity losses, it seems that 
the recent drug summit should more appropriately have been held in Columbia, 
South Carolina, rather than in Colombia, South America.

30-CENT STAMP PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the proposed increase by the U.S. Postal Service, I want to make the 
following comments: 
</P>
<P>
I believe the major portion of the deficit is due primarily to junk mail 
delivered at "bargain basement prices." Think of the cost of extra staff 
handling and delivering printed advertisements and soliciting letters! 
</P>
<P>
When I told a mail carrier that 70% of my mail was junk mail, he replied that 
junk mail was his job insurance.

NEW CURBS ON CIGARETTE SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You present a cogent editorial on the dangers of smoking. It calls for action 
now! It points to the deaths and illnesses and economic losses caused by 
smoking . . . and then it asks what are the Bush Administration's plans to do 
something about it. 
</P>
<P>
The front page and the Business section run stories about how the tobacco 
companies aim their advertising at young, at minorities and at women trying to 
lure them to this insidious drug. 
</P>
<P>
But your same newspaper runs full-page ads for cigarettes and tobacco products. 
Apparently the same people who write your editorials don't control your 
advertising. Apparently promoting addictive drugs that kill and main outweighs 
the loss of advertising income. Don't ask what the Bush Administration will do 
about smoking; what will The Times do about it.

RULING ON OMB ANALYSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial ("Comeuppance for Budget Bullies," Feb. 25) described how the 
U.S. Supreme Court ruled recently that the President's Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) cannot use "paper-work reduction" as an excuse to thwart a law 
requiring employers to warn their employees of hazards in the workplace from 
dangerous chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
You are guilty of taking a cheap, simplistic shot at the entire institution 
because of your disagreement with the policy. If you had liked the policy you 
would be praising OMB for policing a maverick agency. If there were no OMB you 
would criticize the Administration for lack of program coordination and 
budgetary control. 
</P>
<P>
Your editorial conveys an impression that the OMB is simply a bunch of storm 
troopers for the President and operates without regard for the law of the land. 
I assure you that if that is so it is a fairly recent development. I was in the 
statistical policy division of OMB during the 1970s, with responsibilities for 
economic statistics. My copies of our organic laws, the Federal Reports Act of 
1942 and the Budget and Accounting Procedures Act, were on my desk at all 
times, underlined and dogeared from constant reference. 
</P>
<P>
Much of what OMB has done in the paper-work area has benefited the public. The 
Federal Reports Act demanded that the government not impose "unnecessary 
reporting burden" on the public. (Our authority did not extend to the income 
tax forms, unfortunately.) The operative word was "unnecessary," since we and 
most of the responsible reporting public understood the government's need for 
information of all kinds. 
</P>
<P>
We did not permit the reporting burden issue to handcuff a reasonable or 
mandated program, no matter how controversial it was. Under the wise guidance 
of people like Roye Lowry, Paul Krueger, Milton Moss, Margaret Martin, Julius 
Shiskin and Joseph Duncan in my day (and others before them), we cleared forms 
which were opposed by many business including the FTC's line of business form 
and President Nixon's price and wage control regulatory forms. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Budget and Accounting Procedures Act we prepared statistical budgets 
and tried to make government information more accurate, internally consistent, 
timely and credible. We often pushed within OMB for more money to enhance 
statistical programs. 
</P>
<P>
Your editorial talks about "dancing in the corridors" of the agencies because 
of the "comeuppance of a town bully." Well, it is easy to sit back here and 
portray OMB as the bad guy doing the President's dirty work. In fact, when I 
was there (1970-1976) OMB was about 800 highly talented and hard-working 
professionals who quickly impressed each new director. 
</P>
<P>
OMB has power of persuasion as well as of budget review and coordination under 
law. The Times must know that, in real life, agencies are not powerless in the 
face of OMB. They get their way often by going over OMB's head to the President 
or to Congress. For instance, statistical agencies have their own committees on 
the Hill, and OMB is not so powerful if they "go to the mat." The Times, of all 
papers, should resist the urge to use simplistic notions of "good" or "bad," no 
matter how helpful they are in making a point.

NEIL SIMON'S 'WOMEN' IS AN ODD UNCOUPLING

<TEXT>
<P>
"You wanna get laughs or you wanna get better?" asks one of several women in 
"Jake's Women," Neil Simon's latest play, which opened Thursday at the Old 
Globe. "If I get laughs," replies Jake, "I'll get better." 
</P>
<P>
That is exactly how "Jake's Women" feels -- like someone working at getting 
laughs while working at getting better. 
</P>
<P>
Not funny, McGee. 
</P>
<P>
Here is Jake (Peter Coyote), a successful writer, living in a super-fashionable 
apartment in New York's SoHo (a terrific set by Tony Straiges, brightly lit by 
Tharon Musser). 
</P>
<P>
He's the father of a happy daughter Mollie (played at 13 by Sarah Michelle 
Gellar and at 21 by the engaging Amelia Campbell). True, Jake's first wife 
Julie (Felicity Huffman) died young in an auto accident, but Jake has 
remarried, and his new wife Maggie (Stockard Channing), an advertising 
executive, loves him and -- to make this a more perfect union -- dearly loves 
his daughter Mollie. 
</P>
<P>
So why is this man unhappy? 
</P>
<P>
Why can't he let go of the past? Why can't he enjoy the present? Why does he 
play around? Why does he lie to his wife while insisting that she, who has made 
one inadvertent slip, level with him? 
</P>
<P>
Because, as you may have begun to suspect, Jake is very neurotic and Jake is 
not a nice man. 
</P>
<P>
Being alone a lot, and hopelessly self-absorbed (for which he endlessly, 
tediously rebukes himself), Jake airs his Angst by conjuring up the women in 
his life and talking to their imaginary presences. 
</P>
<P>
"Blithe Spirit" this is not. The device is perilous, smacking too much of 
convenience, not enough of engagement. It is also insufficiently explored. When 
Jake tries to throttle the "imaginary" Maggie at one point, it feels as if some 
unseen boundary had been crossed. We know he sees these women, but can he touch 
them too? 
</P>
<P>
Jake suspects Maggie's about to leave him. Incapable of discussing it with her, 
he discusses it with his "materialized" nagging sister Karen (Candice Azzara) 
and his "materialized" therapist Edith (Joyce Van Patten), a ditz who must be 
related to the female therapist in Chris Durang's "Beyond Therapy." 
</P>
<P>
Would that we were beyond therapy. "Jake's Women" feels too much like therapy 
gone awry. Even Jake's reconstituted first wife gets into this act. 
</P>
<P>
When Jake finally gets up the gumption to talk to the real-life Maggie about 
their problems, they separate. Jake tries to date. A scene among Jake, his live 
date-of-the-moment Sheila (Talia Balsam) and the "materialized" Maggie (who 
moved out six months before), has true comic possibilities. But they remain 
either desperately forced or merely unrealized. 
</P>
<P>
What have we got here? "Chapter Three." A cross between Simon's "I Ought to Be 
in Pictures," "Chapter Two" and more recent events in his life -- or more 
semi-psychoautobiography from the Simon files. 
</P>
<P>
Which would be fine, of course, if any of it were funny. But "Jake's Women" 
feels like a protracted "poor me" whine that Peter Coyote's charmless Jake 
seems powerless to rescue. Even Channing's considerable comic gifts are 
confronted with insuperable odds. Balsam can't make Sheila flesh and blood. 
Campbell has the requisite sweetness as Mollie in a role that demands little 
else, but even such pros as Van Patten and Azzara are fighting an uphill 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
The show is as flat as the Mojave Desert and, surprising for Simon, devoid of 
even enough workable one-liners to keep the audience interest from flagging. 
Thursday's crowd was the stillest Simon audience in memory, as if the people 
were politely waiting for the real play to begin. It never did. 
</P>
<P>
This partly explains why director Ron Link was fired over the weekend and 
replaced by the Globe's artistic director, Jack O'Brien. But neither man should 
be held accountable. It is the writer who must look to his script. 
</P>
<P>
Just like its protagonist, "Jake's Women" as a play sends out a mixed and 
troubling message. "We need to be cautious and yet courageous," Jake says to 
Sheila. "We need to hold back and not let anything stop us." That's the word we 
get, subliminally. It's as if Simon decided to write about himself but got cold 
feet. Like Jake, he's holding out on us -- and worse, on himself. 
</P>
<P>
What's next? For all concerned, let's hope not Broadway. "Jake's Women" needs 
to descend peacefully into a drawer for serious reconsideration -- or not -- at 
a much later date.

USC FEELS THE FURY OF ARIZONA, 80-57 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TEMPE, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Raveling, USC basketball coach, had seen enough. 
</P>
<P>
Disgusted when no foul was called when Arizona forward Brian Williams elbowed 
Trojan guard Harold Miner in the head with 6:20 remaining in an 80-57 loss to 
Arizona in the second round of the Pacific 10 Conference tournament Friday 
night, Raveling bolted from his seat and stormed onto the court to confront 
referee Terry Christman. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Miner lost consciousness after Williams hit him in the head, Raveling 
said: "No, he didn't, but I did. That's the only way I can explain me walking 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said it was unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
"They just trapped me in the corner," Williams said. "People don't realize that 
if they can trap you, you have an equal opportunity to get out of it. I just 
pivoted and tried to keep the ball away from (Miner). There was no intent to 
elbow him, but I have to create enough space for me to get out of the jam. 
</P>
<P>
"I think for the most part guards know not to harass big men once they get the 
ball. You might slap the ball away one or two times, but it's dangerous 
territory." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona Coach Lute Olson was stunned when Raveling stormed the court. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like taking a walk (onto the court) a lot of times," Olson said. "But 
George has more courage than I do." 
</P>
<P>
Although Raveling received a technical foul for his antics, he wasn't finished. 
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later, after Christman called a foul against Arizona center Sean 
Rooks for checking Miner, Raveling applauded the call and bowed to the referee 
in jest. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona guard Matt Muehlebach defended against Miner and pretty much took him 
out of the game. Although he scored 14 points to break Don MacLean's Pac-10 
freshman scoring record of 577 points by a point, Miner missed 15 of 20 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I can bounce back, regroup and come back stronger next year," Miner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Left off the All-Pac-10 team, Muehlebach played as if he had something to 
prove, getting 10 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. It was the third time in 
Pac-10 history that a player has reached double figures in points, rebounds and 
assists. Gary Payton got a triple-double in 1989, and Kevin Johnson, former Cal 
guard, had a triple-double in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't try to B.S. you, I voted for Muehlebach on the All-Pac-10 team," 
Raveling said. "I thought he deserved be on it. He's smart and he's an 
excellent defensive player. I like him." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona forward Jud Buechler also played well, scoring the Wildcats' first 11 
points. He finished with 20 points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Matt had a super game," Buechler said. "I'm a bit jealous." 
</P>
<P>
But the Wildcats' front line depth doomed USC as Arizona defeated the Trojans 
for the 10th consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
Rooks had 18 points in a substitute's role and center Ed Stokes had 12 points 
and 12 rebounds as Arizona outrebounded USC, 56-33. 
</P>
<P>
Raveling wouldn't mind having some of Arizona's big men. 
</P>
<P>
"I've often felt you ought to be able to make trades in college basketball," 
Raveling said. "They've got all those big guys and we can make a trade. We'll 
send them one of our defensive backs." 
</P>
<P>
The No. 15 Wildcats (22-6) who have won 12 consecutive Pac-10 games since a 
73-67 loss to UCLA, will play Stanford in a Pac-10 semifinal game today. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they do well in the NCAA tournament," Raveling said. "They certainly 
have the capability of being a Final Four team." 
</P>
<P>
Leading 33-23 at halftime, Arizona outscored USC, 17-6, in the first 4:39 of 
the second half to take command. The Wildcats led by as many as 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Coleman had a team-high 15 points for USC, which finished the season at 
12-16.

LONG BEACH, HARRIS OFF TO A GOOD START IN BIG WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lucious Harris, Cal State Long Beach's freshman guard, wasn't worried about 
playing in his first tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
"I just stay cool," Harris said after scoring a career-high 23 points to lead 
the 49ers to an 86-68 victory over Utah State in the Big West Conference 
tournament Friday at the Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who made eight of 11 shots, said he felt pressure "at first, but then 
it was just another game, another step." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the eighth in a row for the 49ers (21-7), who will play New 
Mexico State in the semifinals tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't panic or worry about anything. He just goes out and plays," Tyrone 
Mitchell, the 49ers' senior guard, said of Harris. "I take a lot of pressure 
off him -- I let him play and I do the rest of the stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell had nine assists against Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach had not won a postseason game in its last five attempts, three under 
Coach Joe Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the first tournament game for about eight of our guys, so they're 
1-0," Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers won the game with two big surges in the last eight minutes of the 
first half. Over that span, they outscored Utah State, 27-10, and led at the 
half, 45-31. The Aggies never seriously threatened in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State lost its last lead when Kevin Cutler, who had 19 points and 12 
rebounds, scored on a jump shot in the lane. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell then stole the ball from Allen Gordon and drove for a layup. 
</P>
<P>
Cutler scored again in the lane to put the 49ers ahead, 28-23. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State (14-16) not only started missing shots, but also started making 
errors against Long Beach's press. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively they caused us problems," Aggie Coach Kohn Smith said. "After they 
put on their press, they rushed us into off-balance shots." 
</P>
<P>
A three-point play by Harris and a reverse dunk by Rudy Harvey, which followed 
an Aggie turnover, made it 33-23. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State got back to within 35-29, but the 49ers closed the half with a 10-2 
run, which featured two baskets each by Cutler and Frankie Edwards, and a 
reverse dunk by Joseph, who had driven the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers shot 52% from the field in the first half and forced the Aggies into 
13 of their 20 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve forward Frankie Edwards scored 16 points for the 49ers, making seven of 
10 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall Youngblood led Utah State with 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with 21 wins," Harrington said. "Happy but not satisfied. We're 
getting into a better rhythm on offense, better than we have had at any time 
this season. They're a happy bunch of guys, and they're working hard."

NOW IS THE TIME TO GIVE WALT CREDIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In four years at UCLA, all Walt Hazzard did was win two Pac-10 championships, 
including the first Pac-10 tournament in 1986, win the NIT championship in 
1985, and average 19 wins a season with significantly less talent than the 
current team. Walt was never reprimanded by the Pac-10 for berating officials, 
his players were not known as whiners and he never lost five games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
You can't blame Coach Hazzard anymore for the ills affecting the program. If he 
had had a team with this much talent that consistently played this poorly, the 
media and the boosters would have hung him in effigy. I'm not suggesting anyone 
do that to Coach (Jim) Harrick, but I am suggesting it's time people recognized 
the positive contributions Coach Hazzard made to the UCLA program.

COVERAGE OF GATHERS' DEATH BRINGS STRONG REACTION FROM READERS

<TEXT>
<P>
After sifting through countless stories about athletes on drugs, lockouts, 
point shaving and the like, it was always a pleasure to flip to the South Bay 
section of The Times and find a story about Hank Gathers and the Loyola Lions. 
I was looking forward to the day when news about Loyola would supplant that 
about USC, UCLA and even the Lakers on the front page of the sports section. 
</P>
<P>
It happened on Monday, but not at all in the way it was supposed to.

IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO MAKE MORE DOLLARS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I couldn't believe what I was reading. Brian Weston (Viewpoint, March 3) wants 
to get rid of Curtis Crayon, who has picked winners paying $253 more than Bob 
Mieszerski, and replace him with "someone who knows what he is doing." 
</P>
<P>
Then he calls Mieszerski's picks "rock-solid and professional." A person goes 
to the track to make as much money as he can, not to see how many winners he 
can pick.

FANS IN FIGHTING MOOD ABOUT KINGS-OILERS BRAWL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
I realize that Earl Gustkey's and Steve Springer's articles on March 2 are 
attempts at satire. However, I take exception to articles and sportswriters 
that decide to express their uninformed opinions in the name of humor. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Gustkey gives his boxing ratings in the ice hockey division and 
says that Marty McSorley "is not alert defensively." Was this the first game 
the guy has seen or is he not aware that McSorley has a reputation in the NHL 
for being a maniac when it comes to fighting? How can you take a guy seriously 
who rates Petr Prajsler first on his list when Prajsler can barely muster up a 
decent body check? So what if he happened to look good that night. The question 
is, is he consistent? 
</P>
<P>
And why can't The Times be more consistent in its coverage of the Kings? They 
get top billing for two days in a row because of a new record for penalties, 
but they couldn't get a front-page story earlier in the season (when they were 
playing decent hockey) unless there was a story on Gretzky or a trade rumor. We 
get half-baked coverage for a wonderful sport and everyone wonders why hockey 
isn't popular in Los Angeles.

So, owner Bruce McNall doesn't think that any fan who was at the Forum on Feb. 
28 was disappointed. I hate to break it to you Bruce, but as one who came to 
see a hockey game and saw a boxing match instead, I was disappointed. I didn't 
pay thousands of dollars for my season seats to see the game I love deteriorate 
into a street brawl.

DUCHESNAYS CAN'T CATCH SOVIET SKATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

He wore a torn striped shirt with a tie. She wore a tattered red dress. If 
there was a sequin or a feather on the ice, it was left behind by a previous 
ice dance team. 
</P>
<P>
Skating a freestyle program Friday night at the world championships that 
depicted the difficulties of daily life for peasants in South America, the 
innovative brother and sister team of Isabelle and Paul Duchesnay earned the 
most perfect scores of 6.0 in a major competition since British dancers Jayne 
Torvill and Christopher Dean in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
But even though the Duchesnays' daring freestyle program was a winner, they 
settled for second place. They could not overcome the lead defending champions 
Marina Klimova and Sergei Ponomarenko of the Soviet Union built in winning the 
first two phases of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the Duchesnays, Klimova and Ponomarenko skated a traditional 
program to "My Fair Lady." The reaction of the capacity crowd of 9,500 at the 
Halifax Metro Centre was exactly that: fair. The Duchesnays received a 
five-minute standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
Even though they represent France, the Duchesnays were raised in Canada. They 
have become the most popular skaters since Torvill and Dean, who won four world 
championships (1981-84) and an Olympic gold medal in 1984. All nine judges gave 
them perfect scores for artistic impression after that performance. The 
Duchesnays received five 6.0s for artistic impression here.

COURIER ELIMINATES KRICKSTEIN; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: BECKER, EDBERG, AGASSI ALSO SWEEP INTO SEMIFINALS AT INDIAN WELLS.

<P>
Just before sundown Friday, a message arrived by Courier. 
</P>
<P>
 Still aiming toward French Open. Stop. But have big job here. Stop. Play 
Edberg next. Stop. On a roll. If I'm lucky, there may be no stopping me -- Jim. 
</P>
<P>
 Courier, a 19-year-old Floridian with hopes of storming Paris with a 
thundering forehand, put himself into a semifinal showdown today with Stefan 
Edberg by upsetting sixth-ranked Aaron Krickstein, 6-2, 7-6 (7-2), in the 
Newsweek Champions Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The 22nd-ranked Courier, a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open, beat 
Krickstein in a matchup of hard-hitters for the right to play the second-seeded 
Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
Courier chose to be optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I've got a good shot if I can get it in a groove," Courier said. 
"But Edberg's not No. 3 for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
And Boris Becker isn't No. 2-ranked for nothing. The top-seeded Becker made 
short work of Jay Berger, 6-1, 6-2, and advanced to a semifinal against Andre 
Agassi, who defeated Emilio Sanchez of Spain, 6-1, 7-6 (7-3). 
</P>
<P>
Edberg defeated fellow Swede Jan Gunnarsson, 6-2, 6-2, and waited to see who he 
would play. 
</P>
<P>
Courier's victory was the day's only upset, and it may improve his sleep. After 
losing a third-set tiebreaker, 9-7, to Mark Kratzmann in Philadelphia, Courier 
said he didn't sleep for three nights. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept replaying those points in my mind," he said. "It was like a recurring 
nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
For Becker, he decided to cast off a bad dream, too. He decided not to play 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lesson from last year, I think," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
Becker needed only 65 minutes to avenge a year-old defeat, which he blamed on 
playing 18 holes of golf the day before. Berger, who administered Becker's 
worst defeat in last year's Newsweek tournament, 6-1, 6-1, smiled when Becker 
whispered something to him after the rematch. 
</P>
<P>
"He said I was still up by one game," said Berger, who acknowledged that there 
was little he could do against a formidable opponent playing at the top of his 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"Boris is an unbelievably strong player," Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who said he wouldn't comment further on the Davis Cup, was greeted by a 
smattering of boos as he walked on the court. But he said he was not fazed by 
the mixed reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't notice it too much at all," said Agassi, who cut nothing from his 
post-match act. 
</P>
<P>
He climbed over the net to shake hands with Sanchez and patted him on the back. 
Then Agassi peeled off his shirt, wadded it up in a ball and tossed it into the 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
He wrapped up the tiebreaker as impressively, after splitting the first four 
points with Sanchez. Using a well-placed forehand lob winner, followed by a 
tricky 58 m.p.h. first serve that Sanchez returned long, and a deftly placed 
backhand volley, Agassi built a 5-2 lead and won the tiebreaker, 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Becker served notice in the first set that there would be no 
recurrence of last year's upset. He allowed only five points on his serve, 
broke Berger in the second and fourth games and deposited winners with ease. 
</P>
<P>
Serving for the match at 5-2, Becker won the first point after a 115-m.p.h. 
first serve, got to 40-0 with a 110-m.p.h. ace and closed out the match with a 
service winner that Berger could only graze. 
</P>
<P>
After sweeping into the semifinals, Edberg conceded that the struggle for No. 1 
is between Ivan Lendl and Becker, but said he shouldn't be overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'm very far behind," Edberg said. "Lendl has had a very good 
year already and he's tough as well as Boris. I think they're very very close." 
</P>
<P>
After making 86% of his first serves against Gunnarsson, Edberg's arrival in 
the semifinals has been like clockwork. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Edberg has beaten Scott Davis in 69 minutes, Sergi Bruguera in 58 
minutes and Gunnarsson in 61 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg said he is playing well and completely recovered from the stomach-muscle 
injury that forced him to retire in the Australian Open final. 
</P>
<P>
Courier makes no secret of the fact that his big tournament of the year is the 
French Open, where endurance and shot-making are the most valued qualities. 
</P>
<P>
"I like my forehand a lot and I like my competitiveness," he said. "I don't 
really give up."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;

AUBURN UPSETS NO. 16 LSU AS OPTIONS RUN OUT, BUT NOT TIME

<P>
By the time the ball got to John Caylor in the right corner, Auburn's options 
had run out. 
</P>
<P>
But as things turned out, it really didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
Caylor made a three-point shot with just under seven seconds remaining to give 
the Tigers their only lead in the game, one that gave them a 78-76 upset 
victory over 16th-ranked Louisiana State in the quarterfinals of the 
Southeastern Conference tournament at Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Caylor was the third option, with Auburn wanting to go first to Ronnie Battle 
or Derrick Dennison outside, then Caylor inside. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nobody (open) so I just shot it up," Caylor said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the one I wanted because it went in," Auburn Coach Tommy Joe Eagles said. 
"I didn't want another." 
</P>
<P>
LSU, which lost a five-point lead in the final 50 seconds, hustled to get an 
off-balance shot by Chris Jackson at the buzzer that was short. Jackson scored 
28 points. 
</P>
<P>
Caylor's game-winner capped a comeback from a 15-point first-half deficit for 
the Tigers (13-17). 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Gallon made two free throws with 41 seconds left and Dennison, who 
finished with 34 points, stole the inbounds pass and made a layup to cut the 
lead to 76-75 with 39 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
LSU (22-8) turned it over again on the inbounds pass and Auburn had possession 
with just under 34 seconds remaining, running the clock down to Caylor's shot. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn plays Alabama in the semifinals of the SEC tournament today. The Crimson 
Tide beat Mississippi State, 59-44. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt 78, No. 25 Georgia 74 -- Scott Draud scored four of his 14 points in 
the final 39 seconds of overtime to help the Commodores upset the Bulldogs in 
an SEC quarterfinal game. 
</P>
<P>
The Commodores (16-13), who made 32 of 39 free throws, will play Mississippi in 
today's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt (16-13) never trailed in the extra period, which was forced by 
Marshall Wilson's short jumper with eight seconds left in regulation to lift 
Georgia (20-8) into a 63-63 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi 87, Tennessee 86 -- Joe Harvell made three free throws in the final 
minute to help the Rebels hold off the Volunteers after they nearly squandered 
an 18-point lead in an SEC quarterfinal game. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi (12-16), which split two regular-season games with Tennessee 
(15-13), used a 35-14 run to open an 18-point lead late in the first half, then 
spent the next 25 minutes fighting off the Vols. 
</P>
<P>
ATLANTIC COAST 
</P>
<P>
Virginia 92, North Carolina 85 -- Anthony Oliver scored eight of his 
career-high 23 points in overtime as the Cavaliers beat the Tar Heels in the 
first round of the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament at Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth-seeded Cavaliers (18-10) advance to today's semifinals and will meet 
17th-ranked and top-seeded Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-seeded Tar Heels (19-12) tied the game at 81-81 with five seconds 
remaining in regulation when Scott Williams tapped in a miss by King Rice with 
five seconds left. The basket came after Bryant Stith, who led the Cavaliers 
with 32 points and 11 rebounds, was called for charging with 35 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia had a chance to win in regulation, but Williams blocked a 15-foot 
jumper by John Crotty as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
No. 17 Clemson 79, Wake Forest 70 -- David Young scored the final six points 
for the Tigers to help them get their first opening-round victory in the ACC 
tournament in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson (24-7), which earned the tournament's top seed after winning its first 
regular-season ACC title, had a 26-point lead in the first half and led by 16 
early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
But the Demon Deacons (12-16) cut the lead to three points in the last two 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Young made a three-point shot -- his only basket of the game -- with 1:15 left 
to give the Tigers a 74-68 lead. He then made the front end of a one-and-one 
with 55 seconds to play and two foul shots with 15 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
No. 12 Duke 104, Maryland 84 -- Phil Henderson scored 24 points and Bobby 
Hurley keyed an early second-half rally as the Blue Devils routed the Terrapins 
in a first-round ACC game. 
</P>
<P>
After scoring game's first seven points, Maryland went cold and basically 
stayed that way for the duration. The Terrapins (18-13) had just three baskets 
in the first nine minutes of the second half, and Hurley led a run that put 
Duke (24-7) ahead and into today's semifinals against Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
Hurley scored the first seven points in a 9-2 run that lifted the Blue Devils 
from a 60-57 deficit to a 66-62 lead after Henderson made two free throws with 
12:31 left. 
</P>
<P>
No. 14 Georgia Tech 76, North Carolina State 67 -- Dennis Scott scored 23 
points and Brian Oliver had 22 to spark a second-half comeback in a first-round 
ACC game. 
</P>
<P>
The Yellow Jackets (22-6) trailed, 40-30, at halftime, and went on a 17-3 run 
to take a 58-52 lead after Johnny McNeil hit two successive baskets, the last 
with 5:35 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
N.C. State (18-12) got no closer than four points the rest of the way. Rodney 
Monroe scored 20 points for the Wolfpack. 
</P>
<P>
METRO 
</P>
<P>
No. 18 Louisville 76, Memphis State 73 -- Jerome Harmon came off the bench and 
scored 22 points and the Cardinals (25-7) held the Tigers (18-11)without a 
basket for nearly eight minutes in the semifinals of the Metro Conference 
tournament at Biloxi, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
Regular-season champion Louisville had a 20-point second half lead reduced to 
three points in the final minute, but held on to reach the tournament title 
game for the fifth consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
In the other Metro semifinal game, Southern Mississippi beat Cincinnati, 75-73. 
</P>
<P>
SOUTHWEST 
</P>
<P>
No. 9 Arkansas 84, Southern Methodist 61 -- Oliver Miller, known more for his 
rebounding and shot-blocking, scored a career-high 22 points to carry the 
Razorbacks past the Mustangs in the quarterfinals of the Southwest Conference 
tournament at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas, the regular season SWC champion, advanced to today's semifinals. The 
Razorbacks will play Baylor in today's semifinals. The Bears beat TCU, 72-62.

for SMU (10-18). 
</P>
<P>
Texas 92, Texas A&amp;M 84 -- Lance Blanks scored 27 points to lead five 
teammates in double figures as the Longhorns (21-7) beat the Aggies (14-17) for 
the third time this season. The Longhorns will play Houston (24-6) in the other 
SWC semifinal. The Cougars beat Rice, 90-81.

MIDWESTERN COLLEGIATE 
</P>
<P>
No. 24 Xavier (Ohio) 89, Evansville 78 -- Michael Davenport scored 22 points 
and the Musketeers (26-3) used big runs in each half to beat the Purple Aces 
(17-14) in the semifinals of the Midwestern Collegiate Conference tournament at 
Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Musketeers, who have won 14 of their last 15 games, will meet 
second-seeded Dayton in tonight's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Dayton 97, Loyola (Ill.) 95 -- Negele Knight scored 34 points, including four

NBA ROUNDUP;

TRAIL BLAZERS CONTINUE TO WIN ON EAST COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was only a few years ago that, except for the Lakers, almost all the power 
in the NBA was in the East. There has been a major switch. 
</P>
<P>
Western teams such as Portland, Phoenix and Utah go east and find success. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers are the scourge of the Atlantic Division. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Drexler scored 12 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter to lead Portland 
to a 104-100 victory over the 76ers Friday night at Philadelphia, knocking 
Charles Barkley &amp; Co. out of first place. 
</P>
<P>
The Blazers, who are 10-1 against the division, wind up play against the 
Atlantic tonight against the Washington Bullets. Their only loss was by a point 
to the 76ers at Portland Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive victory for Portland, whose 42-18 record is the 
fourth best in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
The Blazers led, 100-99, when Barkley, who had 31 points and 11 rebounds, was 
fouled with 31 seconds left. Barkley made a free throw to tie it. He missed the 
second, and four seconds later Jerome Kersey made a jump shot to put Portland 
ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers had taken over the division lead with victories over Boston and New 
York, but now trail the Knicks by percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
"This was some trip," Coach Rick Adelman said. "We beat the top three teams in 
this division. Maybe people back here will realize we are a good team." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 134, Indiana 130 -- There are only six teams in the league with winning 
records on the road. Three, including the Suns, are in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Chambers led Phoenix to its fourth consecutive victory on this trip, 
scoring 41 points. The Suns are 16-14 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 108, Milwaukee 100 -- Karl Malone and Thurl Bailey sent the visiting Jazz 
off to a sizzling start, and it romped to its third consecutive victory on this 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
Malone finished with 40 points and 12 rebounds, helping the Jazz build a 
16-point lead after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey had 20 points as the Jazz increased its lead in the Midwest Division to 
4 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 99, New Jersey 95 -- The one team that doesn't fear the West is 
Detroit. Although the Pistons usually play down to their opponents, they are 
usually good enough to win. 
</P>
<P>
They increased their winning streak to seven games when Isiah Thomas scored 
eight of his 20 points in the closing minutes at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit, which has won 20 of its past 21 games, was hard pressed to come back 
from a 14-point deficit against a team that has won only three of its past 23. 
</P>
<P>
With Sam Bowie sidelined because of flu and his backup, Chris Dudley, injured, 
Charles Shackleford played center for the Nets. He had 15 points and 24 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 115, Boston 108 -- Jeff Malone scored 43 points at Hartford, the 
Celtics' other home, and the Bullets handed Boston its third consecutive home 
loss. It's the first time that has happened since Larry Bird joined the team in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard King scored 10 of his 29 in a fourth-quarter spurt that broke it open. 
Bird played all 48 minutes and had 27 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 107, Seattle 97 -- Dominique Wilkins scored 15 of his 28 points in the 
third quarter, and the Hawks prevented a sweep of the travelers from the West 
for the night. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks, battling to gain the final playoff berth in the East, shot 55.6% 
from the field to end a two-game losing streak. DAN HAFNER

LATE BASKET BEATS LONG BEACH POLY

<TEXT>
<P>
For the first 30 minutes of the Southern California Regional Division I 
championship game Friday night, Santa Ana Mater Dei guard Jason Quinn wasn't a 
factor, but he finished the game a star. 
</P>
<P>
With Mater Dei trailing, 45-43, and 1.8 seconds remaining, Quinn made a 
desperation, 20-foot three-point basket to give the Monarchs a 46-45 victory 
over Long Beach Poly before a crowd of 5,071 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Poly, which made only two of six free throws in the last three minutes of the 
game, had a chance to increase its lead to three points after center Willie 
McGinest made a free throw with 19.3 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
However, McGinnest missed the second and Mater Dei got the rebound. With less 
than five seconds remaining, Quinn found himself trapped on the baseline in the 
right corner and put up the winning shot that hit nothing but net. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea that I'd make it. . . It was just a Hail Mary," said Quinn, who 
finished with 10 points, including eight in the game's final two minutes. "I 
threw it up and just tried to get fouled." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, who was fouled on the play but missed the free throw, sent Mater Dei 
(31-1) into its first State title game since 1987, when it defeated Ygnacio 
Valley, 69-51. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Mater Dei's pressure defense caused problems for Poly's 
half-court offense. During one stretch, the Jackrabbits failed to score a point 
in over six minutes as the Monarchs took a 14-8 lead early in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Poly, which outrebounded the Monarchs, 35-30, began to 
dominate the boards. Scoring mainly on second shots, the Jackrabbits opened a 
44-40 lead with :50 seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
But Quinn made his first of two fourth quarter three-point shots to cut the 
lead to one, setting up the dramatic finish. 
</P>
<P>
"Stuff like this happens," Poly Coach Ron Palmer said. "It is all apart of the 
game. We'll get our share down the line."

KURT SANDERLING SURVEYS BRAHMS WITH PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The center of Kurt Sanderling's three-week Brahms survey with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic is the Second and Third symphonies. As heard Thursday evening at 
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, it is a center of reflective nobility, 
ponderable and more than a little ponderous. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderling treated the pairing for its complementary aspects, rather than its 
contrasts. There would be no rustic dancing here, and the characteristic 
struggles -- though undeniably fierce and pointed at times -- would be played 
out on an abstracted spiritual level. 
</P>
<P>
The opening theme of the Third, for example, carried from the beginning a sense 
of its bittersweet destiny, almost inert at points, with little feeling of 
syncopation and physicality. Then at the end of the symphony, Sanderling 
allowed its rustling recollection in the strings to be nearly buried under the 
sustained winds. 
</P>
<P>
Given this apparent approach, Sanderling not surprisingly placed the emphasis 
in the Second Symphony on its subtle and tragic Adagio. This was a marvel of 
concentrated thought and haunted orchestral chiaroscuro. 
</P>
<P>
In the Third Symphony, it was the soulful Allegretto that proved the emotional 
fulcrum. It led to a finale of great contemplative forbearance, delivered as 
one long, resigned exhalation. 
</P>
<P>
Though eminently poetic, all this could sound underenergized at times. 
Sanderling's pliable tempos were within conventional norms, but the effect was 
invariably expansive and even placid. Nor was he much concerned with 
architectural markers, large or small, creating an organic unity through the 
strength and uncompromising commitment of his vision. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra gave him an alert, sympathetic performance, filled with glowing 
individual and sectional solos. Textures were clear -- no fuzzy Brahms here -- 
and the sound generally lean and gleaming, though there was some odd buzzing in 
both finales. JOHN HENKEN

ABT'S BRIEF AND FRENZIED FLING WITH THARP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC/DANCE CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year go, Twyla Tharp was a provocative fixture at American Ballet Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Baryshnikov -- the matinee idol who ran the company when he wasn't too 
busy making movies or acting in plays or dancing elsewhere -- had elected the 
irresistibly iconoclastic choreographer as his "artistic associate." Going 
straight, in her finely frenzied fashion, Tharp disbanded her touring ensemble 
and joined the ABT team. 
</P>
<P>
She took some of her specialized repertory with her, not to mention a few of 
her own dancers. The collaboration with Baryshnikov &amp; Co. produced some 
appealingly gutsy work as well as some lavish show-bizzy fizzles. Then came the 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Baryshnikov quit Ballet Theatre in a managerial huff. Tharp's name disappeared 
from the managerial roster. 
</P>
<P>
Her future with the company remains clouded. Her present, however, remains 
dazzling, and pleasantly disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
The latest addition to the Tharp oeuvre, first applauded in San Francisco a 
week ago and introduced at the Orange County Performing Arts Center on 
Thursday, is a legacy of the Baryshnikov era. It bears what may be a prophetic 
title: "Brief Fling." 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the fling refers -- or at least pretends to refer -- to a 
charming highland ritual. This is Tharp's Scottish symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind searching for sylphides. Tharp's fling is fast and furious, taut and 
tense. It is refined on the surface yet rough inside. Or is it vice-versa? One 
is never quite sure, and that adds to the compelling intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
At the outset, the ballet looks reasonably polite. It strikes amusing, even 
dainty poses. Then it takes off in potentially suicidal flights, often for 
their own frantic sake. Eventually, Tharp chooses some shocking structural and 
dynamic detours. 
</P>
<P>
The quaint becomes dangerous. The cheer turns dark. 
</P>
<P>
Michel Colombier provided the loud -- too loud -- musical impetus for this 
fusion of strict classicism and feverish adventure. Manipulating the 
technological miracles of tape and computer, he concocted a sonic tapestry that 
innocently explores the country gardens and stranded Handels of Percy Grainger, 
only to succumb to the easy dissonances and portentous rumbles we associate 
with horror flicks. 
</P>
<P>
The score may suggest candy-coated modernism. The choreography, thank goodness, 
does not. 
</P>
<P>
It toys brazenly with a tippy-toe tattoo. It showcases a frenzied ballerina in 
a tartan tutu, partnered by a fearless, airborne cavalier. It adds the casual 
counterforce of some muscular modernists who happen to specialize in bravura 
funk. In a bizarre, perfectly coordinated, essentially symmetrical suite of 
fugues and gigues, flirtations and confusions, the twain eventually meet. 
</P>
<P>
If the clash of impulses is unsettling, its progress is organic and its 
resolution strangely comforting. Cheryl Yeager, the brilliant ballerina, and 
Julio Bocca, her firebrand partner, become more interesting as they shed their 
royal manners. Resident Tharpians -- the devastating Shelley Washington, 
accompanied by Kevin O'Day, Keith Roberts and Jamie Bishton -- become even more 
compelling when they stretch for classical impact. 
</P>
<P>
The supporting corps includes such energetic paragons as Claudia Alfieri, 
Isabella Padovani, Gil Boggs and Robert Wallace. They sustain the aura of 
mock-nationalistic unity and bridge the stylistic gap with splendid, overwound 
bravado. 
</P>
<P>
In this ultracompact 20-minute opus, Tharp redefines conventional rules of 
partnering. She mocks the traditions she observes. More important, perhaps, she 
understands the tradition she mocks. 
</P>
<P>
"Brief Fling" bristles with nervous outbursts, yet dares unwind just when one 
expects a final zonking climax. It shouts its abstract drama. That makes its 
occasional whisper of lyricism all the more affecting. 
</P>
<P>
Isaac Mizrahi has decorated the piece with a bizarre jumble of parody costumes. 
Misplaced plaids and tilted tams adorn a generally courtly corps. Some of the 
men sport formal kilts but no shirts. Baggy slacks coexist with prissy toe 
shoes. The sartorial worlds collide neatly, tellingly. 
</P>
<P>
One sees obvious texts and complex subtexts here. Tharp has much going on. Too 
much, perhaps, for one to absorb in a single viewing. The prospect of 
repetitions -- many and frequent -- is reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
ABT surrounded the novelty with familiar fare. When, one had to wonder, will 
Tharp come up with the full-length ballet she owes us. 
</P>
<P>
The evening opened with the ubiquitous "Kingdom of the Shades" episode from "La 
Bayadere." Susan Jaffe served as a radiant Nikiya, nobly partnered by Kevin 
MacKenzie as Solor and unevenly seconded by Leslie Browne, Cynthia Anderson and 
Christine Dunham as her fluttery attendants. 
</P>
<P>
The 24 ghostlets in white executed their Petipa arabesques rather shakily. The 
brisk tempos favored by Emil de Cou hardly reinforced the aura of otherworldly 
languor, but Ron Oakland (uncredited in the program) performed the violin solos 
exquisitely. 
</P>
<P>
A kind and gentle performance of Agnes de Mille's "Rodeo" completed the bill. 
Shawn Black -- still ranked a member of the corps de ballet -- undertook the 
central conflicts of the cowgirl for the first time, and did so sweetly if a 
bit sketchily. 
</P>
<P>
Ethan Brown didn't strut much stuff in his debut as the head wrangler, and 
Julie Kent seemed content to be blandly pretty in her first outing as the other 
woman. John Gardner returned as the sympathetic, soft-grained champion roper. 
Leading the excellent Pacific Symphony, Jack Everly served Copland heartily in 
the pit.

ROMEO HE'S NOT, BUT PENN'S GOT A HANDLE ON ELOQUENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So what if Michael Penn was Romeo in black jeans? What if he was Heathcliff? 
</P>
<P>
Well, he's not. At least that's the answer to those questions (posed by Penn 
himself so tunefully in his recent rookie hit "No Myth") as gleaned from his 
Roxy debut Thursday, the first of three shows in two nights for the Angeleno. 
</P>
<P>
Penn seems more the kind of guy whose shirt and hair never quite fit right, 
whose shy reservedness could easily be mistaken for brooding awkwardness -- 
hardly the kind to express his passions with grand gestures a la the two cited 
romantic heroes. His performance was nothing if not understated and low-key, 
even at several junctures when the music (powered by a band that now includes X 
drummer D.J. Bonebrake and Lucinda Williams' guitarist Gurf Morlix along with 
long-time collaborator/keyboardist Patrick Warren) rocked flat out. 
</P>
<P>
But he is the kind to express his passions with grand eloquence, a la the folks 
who created Romeo and Heathcliff. He's the rare writer who can make the mundane 
sublime -- the song "Big House," he said, is "about a big house," and 
"Invisible" inspired by a favorite Santa Monica coffee shop, the explanations 
taking nothing away from their agitated and aching qualities, respectively. His 
restrained demeanor only helped bring these out. Grand gestures would have 
squashed them. And, for the record, he was wearing blue jeans. 
</P>
<P>
Penn made one grand gesture, though, in letting opening act Peter Blegvad take 
over for one encore. Blegvad -- who's been in such art-conscious bands as Slapp 
Happy and the Golden Palominos -- tends to pack his songs with thicker irony 
than Penn (he's the kind of guy who brings his brother on stage to help do a 
song that begins, "I'm my father's only son"). But the twists of melodies and 
words yield plenty of pleasures. STEVE HOCHMAN

PETER MURPHY: A CREEPY, FELINE, REPTILIAN PRESENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A puff of fog, a synthesized violin, and it's gloom-rock hero Peter Murphy, 
close-cropped hair protruding like a blond parsnip, posed like St. Sebastian on 
stage at the Wiltern Theatre on Thursday. You've heard of the Thin White Duke? 
Murphy is thinner, whiter, more aristocratic in bearing. 
</P>
<P>
He's the sort of performer who always seems to know, within a degree or two, 
the angle at which his cheekbones glint most fetchingly in the sea-green 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
He'd crouch leonine on a stack of amplifiers and pounce, not skipping a beat. 
He suffered, even as he danced, under lighting designed to look like moaty 
sunbeams filtering into a subterranean prison cell. 
</P>
<P>
When Murphy sang, he directed his words up into the flies and winced, as if 
imploring the Almighty. Murphy's voice is a cross between Bowie and "Lust for 
Life"-era Iggy; his music a slightly jazzier take on the spare, two-chord 
death-rock formula (which he helped invent with Bauhaus, the Led Zeppelin of 
the genre); his performance spectacular, feline, reptilian, letter-perfect, 
creepier than Malcolm McDowell at the height of his powers. 
</P>
<P>
Exene Cervenka, another ex-lead singer of a dark, religion-obsessed ensemble 
(X), opened with a quiet, powerful set of neo-country, her flat, quavering 
voice made strong by a band that included X's Tony Gilkyson on guitar. Thin 
White Rope is scheduled as the opening act for the final night of Murphy's 
Wiltern stand tonight. JONATHAN GOLD

BOB GREENE: NIXON'S PLACE: A GATHERING OF NON-VOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB GREENE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The thing I still love about being on the road, other than 24-hour room 
service, is that you're always learning something new. 
</P>
<P>
For example: When you were growing up, you probably had a drive-in restaurant 
that you and your friends went to. Depending on where you lived, the place 
might have been called Frisch's, it might have been called Bob's Big Boy, it 
might have been called the Peter Pan. Regardless of what it was called, though, 
the routine was the same all over the United States. Kids would pull up in 
their cars on a summer evening, find a parking spot, order some cheap eats, and 
socialize in the warm night air until closing time. 
</P>
<P>
So what have I discovered on this particular trip? Well . . . in Whittier, 
Calif., a town not all that far from Los Angeles, the drive-in restaurant of 
choice during the 1950s was a place called . . . 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's. 
</P>
<P>
Yep. Richard Nixon had strong roots in the city of Whittier, and when he was 
vice president under Dwight D. Eisenhower his younger brother, Donald Nixon, 
apparently aware of the value of the family name, opened up Nixon's Drive-In. 
By all accounts, it was like most other American drive-ins, except it was 
called Nixon's. And the kids loved it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was right on Whittier Boulevard," said Marian Saxon Bramlett, Whittier High 
School class of '58. Bramlett, now 49, works in the personnel department of the 
Whittier High School District. "It was quite popular. On the weekends, you'd 
have to get there pretty early in the evening to be sure to get a space for 
your car." 
</P>
<P>
Paula Abbott, also 49, said, "None of us really thought that it was unusual for 
a drive-in to be called Nixon's. The name certainly had no political meaning 
for us, even though we knew that Donald Nixon's brother was vice president of 
the United States. When someone would say 'Let's go to Nixon's,' our only 
thought was of having a good time. Nixon's was a drive-in, not a politician." 
</P>
<P>
According to Marian Bramlett, Donald Nixon had operated a sit-down place called 
Nixon's Family Restaurant before he opened Nixon's Drive-In. "He kept Nixon's 
Family Restaurant open, but that was mostly for our parents," Bramlett said. 
"The drive-in was for high school kids. So there were really two Nixon's 
restaurants in town at the same time. I'm told that Donald Nixon used to be 
present at the family restaurant, but I never saw him at the drive-in. I 
certainly never saw Richard Nixon at the drive-in." 
</P>
<P>
The courting routine at Nixon's Drive-In, she said, never varied. "The boys 
would arrive together in their souped-up cars, and they would park and open 
their hoods," she said. "The girls would arrive together and walk over to where 
the boys were. The girls would look at the boys, and the boys would look at 
their engines." 
</P>
<P>
Although precise historical documentation is vague, Bramlett and Abbott believe 
that it was 1955 or 1956 when Nixon's Drive-In got competition -- right down 
Whittier Boulevard, but on the other side of the street. The competition came 
in the form of a Bob's Big Boy. 
</P>
<P>
"The food was about the same at both places," Bramlett said. "But at Nixon's, 
you went up and got your French fries and Cokes yourself and took them back to 
your car. At Bob's Big Boy, they had carhops on roller skates." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually Nixon's closed. "It wasn't that the food was bad or anything, or 
that we liked Bob's Big Boy better," Bramlett said. "I just think that Donald 
Nixon may not have been a very good businessman." Donald Nixon died in 1987 at 
the age of 73. 
</P>
<P>
Bramlett said that she drives by the spot where Nixon's used to stand virtually 
every day. Standing on the location now is -- you couldn't make this up -- a 
used car lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that the name Nixon has a certain connotation all around the world," 
Bramlett said. "And I also know that some people have good feelings toward the 
name, and some people have bad feelings toward the name. 
</P>
<P>
"But for a lot of us the word means a lot more than just the name of a man who 
became President. Nixon's was the place where we had the most fun on the nights 
when we were young. We were young and happy, and we went to Nixon's."

BUCK WILLIAMS NETS HAPPINESS AS A TRAIL BLAZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN GOLDSTEIN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a bit of wonderment in Buck Williams these days, as his mind bridges 
the constant turmoil of eight frustrating seasons with the New Jersey Nets to 
his new-found prosperity with the Portland Trail Blazers, a bona fide Western 
Conference title contender. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't ask for anything more than I have now," said the former University of 
Maryland star, who faces the Washington Bullets at the Capital Centre Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a chance to make a lot of noise in our conference, and, for a 
change, I'm having fun playing basketball. I've got a lot of talented players 
around me, and my talent complements theirs. I'm in a situation where I can 
contribute every night." 
</P>
<P>
Save for declaring for free agency, the 6-foot-8 power forward felt trapped as 
the backbone and only consistent performer for the lowly Nets. 
</P>
<P>
But Williams, who turned 30 Thursday, was traded to a contender last June when 
the Nets sent him to Portland for center Sam Bowie and a No. 1 draft pick 
(point guard Mookie Blaylock). 
</P>
<P>
"I think every basketball player wants to showcase his talents, but no one 
seemed to care about the Nets. Playing there got to the point where I was sort 
of like an abused woman. They always think the relationship will get better, 
and it really doesn't. I always hoped it would, but it never did. 
</P>
<P>
"I always worked hard in New Jersey, but the constant losing just drains you. 
Now I look forward to playing before sellout crowds every game in Portland and 
feeling appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
No one appreciates the rugged forward more than his new coach and teammates. 
</P>
<P>
He averages 13.9 points and 9.8 rebounds, and has become the unifying force on 
a Portland team that, in the past, was beset by petty squabbles and jealousies 
among the players. It led to last season's firing of Mike Schuler, who was 
replaced by Rick Adelman. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't believe what Buck has done for this chemistry of this team," said 
Adelman, a favorite for Coach of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have four solid guys -- Terry Porter, Clyde Drexler, Kevin Duckworth and 
Jerome Kersey -- back from last year. Buck gives us a physical presence. We 
don't get pushed around anymore. His work ethic and positive attitude have been 
an inspiration to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Williams is credited with motivating Drexler, an All-Star shooting guard and 
explosive scorer known in the past for moodiness and creating clubhouse unrest. 
</P>
<P>
"Buck has been a very positive influence on Clyde," said Portland vice 
president Bucky Buckwalter. "Clyde is playing the best defense of his career." 
</P>
<P>
Said Adelman: "You can really see the difference in Clyde's play this year. 
He's playing like Buck, doing whatever is necessary to win."

CLAYTON PITCHES NORTHRIDGE PAST CAL STATE L.A., 3-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the moment he was named Cal State Northridge baseball coach in the summer 
of 1988, Bill Kernen has maintained that the key to the Matador program will be 
effective recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
Overshadowed by the players who signed on last season was Kernen's hiring of 
former Cal State Fullerton ace Dave Weatherman as pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
Weatherman, the winningest pitcher in Fullerton history, helped lead the Titans 
to the 1979 national championship. And in his short tenure with the Matadors, 
he has helped develop Weathermanesque potential in sophomore right-hander Craig 
Clayton. 
</P>
<P>
That was evident again Friday night at Cal State Los Angeles where Clayton 
weathered some shaky Northridge defense and pitched a complete game as the 
Matadors defeated the Golden Eagles, 3-2, in a California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. contest. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton, who pitched just 6 2/3 innings last season, allowed three hits and 
struck out six against the Golden Eagles, improving to 5-2 with his third 
complete game. 
</P>
<P>
His effort, coupled with back-to-back home runs by Denny Vigo and Eric Johnson 
in the fourth inning, helped the Matadors (11-10, 6-5 in conference play) end a 
four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I come in between innings I talk to (Weatherman)," Clayton said. 
"He tells me what I should be trying to do and it clicks in just like that." 
</P>
<P>
Weatherman, who compiled a 42-11 record at Fullerton, downplays his impact on 
Clayton's success -- but their similarities in mechanics and attitude are 
obvious to anyone who saw Weatherman pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"(Clayton) has a lot of natural ability but his best quality is his 
competitiveness," Weatherman said. "Each time out, he's gotten better and 
better." 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors, who committed five errors Wednesday in a loss to Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo, had four more against the Golden Eagles (9-13, 2-2), including two 
in the second inning that led to the game's first run. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge came back and took the lead in the fourth on Vigo's and Johnson's 
back-to-back-homers off losing pitcher Abdom Pinon (2-1). It was Vigo's seventh 
homer and Johnson's second. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors added what proved to be the game-winning run in the fifth when 
Mike Sims scored on a wild pitch by Pinon after reaching on a fielder's choice 
and advancing to third on a double by Clayton. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State L.A. pulled to within, 3-2, in the home half of the fifth when Randy 
Day walked, stole second and scored when Sharts mishandled a throw by Clayton 
on a bunt by Brent Bish. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State L.A. missed an opportunity to tie the score in the sixth when 
Picketts, who had singled, was thrown out at the plate trying to score on a 
double to left field by Mart Tourville. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors and Golden Eagles conclude their two-game series today at Matador 
Field at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge then plays 11 nonconference games -- eight against Division I 
opponents -- before resuming CCAA play April 5 against Cal Poly Pomona.

CSUN TO GLIMPSE DIFFICULT FUTURE IN TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone with visions of Cal State Northridge having a quick and widespread 
impact in NCAA Division I should attend a track and field meet involving CSUN, 
Azusa Pacific, the Cal women's team and UCLA at Drake Stadium this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity between a high-quality Division I and Division II program will be 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
The Northridge men have placed among the top nine teams in the Division II 
championships in nine of the past 10 years, and the Lady Matadors have finished 
in the top nine in seven of the past eight Division II meets. Yet Northridge, 
which will move to Division I in all sports except football starting in the 
fall, will be no match for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The mismatch will have little to do with inferior coaching or a lack of effort 
or desire by Northridge athletes. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors simply do not have the manpower to compete with the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
Tradition has something to do with that. UCLA is steeped in it -- the Bruin men 
have won eight NCAA titles and the women have won four national championships 
(including two in the Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women) -- while 
Northridge is still trying to establish a tradition. The Lady Matadors did win 
three consecutive AIAW titles from 1978-80 but funding for women's track 
dropped substantially when Northridge moved to Division II in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Money -- in the form of scholarships -- is needed to attract blue-chip athletes 
and Northridge cannot compete with UCLA in this area. 
</P>
<P>
And it won't be able to for several years, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
While UCLA offers the Division I maximum of 14 men's and 16 women's full track 
scholarships (worth approximately $8,000 each), the Matadors have roughly 3 1/4 
men's and 3 3/4 women's scholarships (worth $5,500 each), according to CSUN 
Coach Don Strametz. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's scholarship totals are projected to double (to six men's and seven 
women's) by 1993, but even then Strametz cannot foresee the Matadors finishing 
among the top 10 or 15 teams in the Division I meet. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we have the maximum number of full rides, I don't think that's 
possible," Strametz said. "It's not even feasible to talk about it right now." 
</P>
<P>
So Strametz will continue to make do by dividing his full scholarships among as 
many good athletes as he can. 
</P>
<P>
No one is on a full ride at Northridge -- not even Darcy Arreola, who ranked 
10th in the nation in the 1,500 meters in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Northridge wants to be very, very competitive in a dual-meet type situation. 
And I think we're headed in that direction," Strametz said. "But that doesn't 
guarantee success in the (national championships), where a few studs can score 
a lot of points." 
</P>
<P>
The field events today begin at 11 a.m. followed by the running events. 
</P>
<P>
Convincing facts: Need more evidence of the qualitative differences between 
Division I and Division II track? 
</P>
<P>
In Northridge history, only seven men (five in the javelin and two in the 
shotput) would have met the qualifying standards for this year's NCAA Division 
I championships. The most recent would-be qualifiers: javelin throwers Shawn 
Denton and Dave Stephens, who threw 261 feet 10 inches and 261-6, respectively, 
with the old-style javelin in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Quick start: Hampered by a back injury last year, John Knight of UCLA is off to 
a healthy start. 
</P>
<P>
The former Oak Park High standout, who placed eighth in the hammer throw in the 
1988 and '89 NCAA championships, threw a personal-best 212-8 to win last 
Saturday's triangular meet against Cal State Los Angeles and Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo at Drake Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Knight's effort qualified him for this year's NCAA meet, added 5 feet 2 inches 
to his previous best, and now ranks second on the all-time Bruin list behind 
Dave Wilson's 224-8. 
</P>
<P>
"Our throwers got off to a great start," UCLA Coach Bob Larsen said. "They're 
going to be one of our strengths this season." 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled debut: Arreola, who is redshirting because of injuries suffered 
during the cross-country season, is expected to compete in her first race of 
the track season in the Northridge Invitational at CSUN on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
However, it has not been decided in which event or events Arreola will run. 
</P>
<P>
All-CCAA II: The California Collegiate Athletic Assn. announced its men's and 
women's all-conference basketball teams last week, but here is the unofficial 
All-CCAA name team for men. 
</P>
<P>
At forward are Cam Skaugrud of Chapman and Marvin Redeemer of Cal State 
Bakersfield. The center is Beau Redstone of Bakersfield, and the guards are 
Chancellor McCobb of Cal Poly Pomona and Segaro Bozart of Cal State Dominguez 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The second team includes forwards Clyde Fontenette (UC Riverside) and Coby 
Naess (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo), center-forward Frantz Reyes of Chapman, and 
guards D. C. Cashman (San Luis Obispo) and Bo Ashkenazy (Riverside). 
</P>
<P>
Home-court advantage: Canyons, which lost to host Sequoias in the final eight 
of the women's state basketball tournament last week, will attempt to show that 
turnabout is fair play when it plays host to the state tournament next year. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, the coaches' committee selected Canyons as the host for the 1991 
tournament, pending approval of the state community college board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Having the tournament at Canyons is no guarantee that the Cougars will be in 
the tournament. Yet Canyons, which has four freshman starters, will be an early 
favorite for the elite eight. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons (25-8) has only two sophomores on the roster, although one is Kodak 
All-American nominee Tressie Millender. 
</P>
<P>
"The youth of the team speaks for itself," Canyons Coach Jeff Dunlap said. "It 
will give our program some exposure, and it will be exciting for the girls to 
be playing on their home floor. As a coach, hopefully I'll be part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Name game: Mission's baseball roster lists three players, all unrelated, with 
the surname Chavez -- catcher Jose, left fielder Robert and third baseman 
Robert. The Free Spirit also has two Romos -- brothers Chris and Nino. 
</P>
<P>
Out but not down: Glendale failed to advance to the eight-team men's state 
basketball tournament finals when it lost in overtime last Saturday to Rancho 
Santiago, 86-84, in the Southern California regional. However, Coach Brian 
Beauchemin wasn't hanging his head after a 24-12 season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the competition we played throughout the year was extremely 
good," Beauchemin said. "At one point, we were 21-6. In that 21 wins were a lot 
of road victories that took a lot of effort. 
</P>
<P>
"From that standpoint, it was really a great year."

Although others see a potential power when they look at the Taft High track 
program, all Coach Mel Hein can see are the shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
"We're weak in the hurdles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That might be one of only a few of Taft's weaknesses. The team lacks depth in 
all individual events except the distance races, but the Toreadors, as Kennedy 
Coach Warren Farlow put it, "are going to be a powerhouse." 
</P>
<P>
Taft might not be as strong as it was during the era of Quincy Watts, a 
much-heralded sprinter who helped the Toreadors dash off with the 1986 state 
title and consecutive City Section championships in '86 and '87, but it should 
run away with the Northwest Valley Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
"This year we have sprinters like we didn't last year," Hein said, "and that 
makes a relay team which will score you a lot of points." 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Benitez, a senior transfer from Trona High, timed 48.9 for 400 meters 
last year in qualifying for the Southern Section 1-A Division final. 
</P>
<P>
Another addition is Irving Carter, a senior from Antelope Valley High who will 
run a leg on the 400-meter relay and compete in the horizontal jumps. He 
already has bounded 43 feet, eight inches in the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
Taft's 400 relay team of Cornell Hill, Carter, Clint Stokes and Darren 
Lemontree timed 43.8 seconds in a nonconference meet last month. Hill impressed 
Hein when he cleared 6-4 in the high jump and leaped 20-5 in the long jump 
without any practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I'm going to mess him up by having him practice," Hein joked. 
</P>
<P>
Taft, which placed third in the conference last year, lost pole vaulters Greg 
Sheets and Rejesh Chauhan to graduation, but shotputter Greg Bernard leads the 
team's field event athletes. Bernard, an All-Valley football player whose best 
in the shotput last year was 52-4, placed second in the '89 City finals. 
</P>
<P>
Pole vaulter Josh Cook competed in the shadows of Sheets (15-1) and Chauhan 
(13-9) last year. His best was 11-6, but the senior has cleared 12 feet in 
practice and he could reach the 13-foot range, Hein said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Taft's City championship cross-country team give the Toreadors a 
strong distance group. Junior Brian Godsey clocked 4:31.71 for 1,600 meters 
last year and helped the Toreadors' cross-country team to the City title with a 
fifth-place individual finish. 
</P>
<P>
Senior David Rodriguez and juniors Kipp Ortenberger and Torino Carr provide 
depth in the longer races. Sophomore Mike Krentzin, Taft's No. 5 runner in the 
City cross-country finals, is recovering from a stress fracture that forced him 
to miss the state Division I championship. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals to watch: 
</P>
<P>
Obed Aguirre (San Fernando): Aguirre placed third in 9:17.87 in the City 
3,200-meter final last year as a junior and is a favorite to win the title this 
year. He also clocked 4:26.35 in the 1,600. In November, he won the City 
cross-country championship and placed seventh in the state Division I meet. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Blackwell (Hart): The senior rushed for more than 1,200 yards and scored 
24 touchdowns for the Indians in the fall from his tailback position, and he 
returns with a 43-0 mark in the triple jump. He bounded 42-6 in Hart's opening 
meet against rival Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Casey (Sylmar): Casey qualified for the City final in the 100 last year 
but misunderstood that the meet would be held despite the teachers' strike 
against Los Angeles Unifed School District and missed the race. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartan senior, who rushed for 1,447 yards in the fall and has committed to 
USC, timed 10.9 for the 100. His best in the long jump is 22-6. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Dameworth (Agoura): The Charger senior claimed an unprecedented third 
state Division I cross-country title in November but has yet to win a state 
championship on the track. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth, the 1989 Kinney national cross-country champion, returns with a 
9:00.27 mark in the 3,200 and will try to improve on a second-place finish in 
last year's state final. 
</P>
<P>
At the Times/Eagle Indoor Games at the Forum in February, Dameworth ran a 
converted 4:11.6 mark for 1,600 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Gastelum (Birmingham): Gastelum, second in the 1,600 in the 1989 City 
finals as a junior, will renew his rivalry with defending champion Danny Jordan 
of Venice. Gastelum has recorded a 4:17.29 mark at that distance. He finished 
second to Aguirre in last fall's cross-country finals. 
</P>
<P>
Gabe Higa (Quartz Hill): The defending 4-A champion in the triple jump returns 
as the Valley's No. 1 jumper. He placed second in last spring's Southern 
Section Master's Meet with a wind-aided 49-9 1/4 mark and finished eighth in 
the triple jump in the state finals. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lindsay (Thousand Oaks): Sixth in the 4-A 300-meter intermediate hurdles 
last year, Lindsay timed 39.0 for the event as a junior and heads Valley 
returnees this season. A 22-6 long jumper last year, Lindsay finished ninth in 
the 4-A final. He has also timed 15.3 for the 110-meter high hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Richter (Oak Park): Academic ineligibility forced Richter to miss the 
Southern Section 1-A championships last May, but the senior returns as the No. 
1 400-meter runner in the Valley with a 48.68 mark. 
</P>
<P>
He also has timed 11.22 and 22.7 in the 100 and 200, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Ross (Royal): He is an All-Ventura County defensive back and he returns 
with bests of 6-6 1/2 in the high jump and 42-11 in the triple jump. Last year 
as a sophomore, Ross won Marmonte League titles in both events and placed sixth 
in the high jump at the 4-A championships. 
</P>
<P>
Abe Valdez (Camarillo): Valdez placed seventh in the 3,200 in 9:07.0 last 
spring and led the Scorpions' cross-country team to the state Division I crown 
with a fourth-place individual finish. Valdez, a senior, finished second to 
Dameworth by two-tenths of a second in the 3,200 at the Ventura County 
championships in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Van Scoy (Rio Mesa): Van Scoy led Valley athletes in the shotput and 
discus last year as a sophomore with throws of 55-1 1/2 and 165-0, 
respectively. He placed fifth in the 3-A shotput final and is the defending 
Ventura County champion in the discus.

CORCORAN GETS CHAMINADE OUT OF THE WOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ted Corcoran's home run trot almost ended at first base. 
</P>
<P>
The Westside tournament Red Division semifinal game Friday between Taft and 
Chaminade highs came to a confusing conclusion after Corcoran, Chaminade's 
sophomore first baseman, had apparently given the Eagles a dramatic 7-6 victory 
with a towering solo home run in the bottom of the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
But Corcoran, a husky left-handed hitter, was forced to wait anxiously, hands 
on hips, feet on first base and eyes on both umpires, as the officials held 
court with both coaches near the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Corcoran's home run had caromed back onto the field and was retrieved by 
right-fielder Joel Montano, forcing Corcoran to scurry back to first base. 
</P>
<P>
Had Corcoran's blast banked off the 50-foot-high right-field screen at 
Chaminade? Or had it hit the trunk of one of the giant eucalyptus trees just 
beyond the screen? 
</P>
<P>
"I heard tree branches the whole time, so I figured it had to be gone," 
Corcoran said. "I was positive it was out, but I wasn't about to get thrown out 
this late in the game. I thought it might be just a single." 
</P>
<P>
It was worth more, the umpires ruled, and Corcoran circled the bases. 
</P>
<P>
The score then settled, Chaminade (3-1) had completed a stunning comeback, 
scoring four times in the inning on back-to-back home runs to advance to 
today's 11 a.m. championship game against Channel Islands at Jackie Robinson 
Stadium in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
With one out, runners at first and second and Chaminade trailing, 6-3, junior 
Aaron Weiss, another left-handed hitter, blasted a home run over the 
right-field screen to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
"Three runs down," Weiss said simply. "I knew this was the game and I had to go 
deep." 
</P>
<P>
Weiss' home run came on the first pitch from starter Eddie Soto and knocked the 
junior right-hander from the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Mike Krasner (2-1) then entered the game, which didn't last much 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
Until the seventh, Taft (3-2) had done a good job of stifling Chaminade 
rallies. Catcher Carey Wilbur had thrown out four baserunners and had Corcoran 
pegged trying to steal home in the first inning, but Soto was charged with a 
balk and Corcoran scored. 
</P>
<P>
Taft capitalized on three Chaminade errors in the first two innings and when 
shortstop Benji Belfield smacked a two-run double in the second, the Toreadors 
led, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade scored a run in the third, but Taft extended its lead with two runs 
in the sixth.

CLARK TO TEST FAITH BAPTIST IN TITLE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faith Baptist High basketball Coach Stuart Mason's first order of business 
Friday was to find out as much as possible about the El Cajon Christian 
basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Mason found all he needed to know in two words: Tony Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, a 6-foot-8 senior forward, is averaging 43 points a game for Christian 
(18-11), which will play Faith Baptist (21-10) at 4:30 p.m. today at Cal State 
Dominguez Hills for the Southern California regional Division V championship. 
The winner advances to the state finals Friday in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who will attend the University of Arizona in the fall, is reportedly one 
of the best players to come out of San Diego County. He holds section records 
for points in a career (2,474), season (1,264) and game (63, vs. La Jolla 
Country Day this season). 
</P>
<P>
Clark scored 52 points against San Juan Capistrano St. Margaret's in the 
regional opener Tuesday and added 30 against Paramount Brethren on Thursday in 
the regional semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard about all those records and numbers," said Mason, whose team 
advanced to the regional final with a 61-57 upset of Ribet Christian on 
Thursday. "He sounds like a very good player. It also sounds like if we can 
shut him down, we'll shut their team down." 
</P>
<P>
Christian, the San Diego Section Division V champion, sputtered early in the 
season as Clark received little support. But Coach Randy Wright said the rest 
of the Patriot lineup has developed, providing more relief for Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Christian has plenty of size with 6-6 forward Dave Piester and 6-2 center 
Dwaine Lee. 
</P>
<P>
The tallest player for Faith Baptist, the Southern Section Division I champion, 
is Peter Rasmussen, a 6-6 sophomore center who scored 18 points and grabbed 13 
rebounds against Ribet Christian. 
</P>
<P>
The Contenders' leading scorer, Alex Estrada, a 5-8 sophomore guard, is 
battling the flu. But Estrada played in Tuesday's 67-52 win over Calipatria and 
scored 17 points against Ribet Christian. 
</P>
<P>
"Several of our guys are feeling a little under the weather," Mason said. 
"We've been doing a lot of praying this week. We've got some more still to do."

DAVE DISTEL: THE COMMON DENOMINATOR IN POINT LOMA'S SUCCESS: COACH T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Point Loma High School's girls are playing for the Southern California Division 
II basketball championship today. 
</P>
<P>
As news goes, this is dog-bites-man stuff. 
</P>
<P>
A regional final without Point Loma's girls would be like Donald Trump without 
an ego, Jack McKeon without a cigar or Lee Hamilton without an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, it just doesn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our seventh time in eight years," said Coach Lee Trepanier, who has 
coached basketball's version of the Pointer sisters to 335 victories and a mere 
50 losses over 15 years. "Just think, we're one game away from state." 
</P>
<P>
Again. 
</P>
<P>
And Coach T, as they call him, was marveling at the thought, as though in awe. 
Obviously, each time is as nice as the time(s) before. 
</P>
<P>
That one game Point Loma needs to win to get to the state final (again) will be 
against Pasadena Muir at 1:30 in the Los Angeles Sports Arena. Win today, and 
the kids get a chance to hang still one more state championship banner along 
the wall of the campus gym up there on Chatsworth Boulevard. There are four 
there already. 
</P>
<P>
Muir, however, represents an interesting footnote in the recent history of 
Point Loma girls' basketball. 
</P>
<P>
In December 1985, to be precise, Muir beat Point Loma in one of those holiday 
tournament games. Point Loma had won 62 consecutive games before that loss and 
74 consecutive games after it, accounting for a tidy record of 136-1 over a 
stretch of five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Muir, in this sense, was like the pitcher who stopped Joe DiMaggio's streak. 
</P>
<P>
Those, of course, were different teams and different players. Successful 
coaches with successful programs are able to sustain through the inevitable 
transitions, which might be more volatile on the high school level than 
anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Trepanier qualifies as a successful coach running a successful 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Understand that he might not win many popularity contests north of I-8 or east 
of I-5 or south of Rosecrans. His detractors insist his players arrive 
literally by the busload from other areas in the San Diego district. So what? 
The busing program is tied into the district curriculum. To hear others (read 
that losers) tell it, the guy brings his players to school in limousines. 
</P>
<P>
Paying this juggernaut a visit Thursday night, I expected to find Little Miss 
Showtime. Just roll out the basketball and turn 'em loose. Naturally, they 
would be tall, fast and flashy. Jack Nicholson might even be there to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, they looked more like they came out of a biology class. Their 
warm-up jerseys had nicknames such as Untouchable, Stretch, Rocko, Mighty Jo 
and E-Bay Lok (as well as some less imaginative real names such as Davis, 
Stacy, Moss and Neves). 
</P>
<P>
When the game began, I could see why Neves would choose her own name rather 
than a nickname. Claudine Neves was nothing but serious. She was the point 
guard, running the offense, and her determination and discipline seemed to 
define the work ethic of the team. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this was far from a flash-and-dash aggregation. The word that comes to 
mind is gritty. 
</P>
<P>
Both Point Loma and its opponent, La Quinta, went into the game with 28-3 
records. Point Loma had its star, Tyeast (Untouchable) Brown, and La Quinta had 
its star, Amy Jalewalia, and what they did was virtually neutralize each other. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jalewalia's teammates were getting the best of Brown's. Point Loma 
looked like it was going anywhere but to another Southern California 
championship game. It made only one of 16 shots in the first quarter and five 
of 30 in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Given those numbers, one might assume the Pointers trailed by maybe 20 points. 
Not exactly. That dirty D word, defense, kept them close. 
</P>
<P>
With La Quinta's players hanging all over Brown like Christmas ornaments, Point 
Loma came up with another hero for the occasion. Robin (Rocko) Rabello made big 
baskets at the end of the second and third quarters to keep it close and yet 
another with seven seconds to play in the game to provide the comfort zone in 
what was finally an uncomfortable 39-36 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Rabello, of course, is yet another of those made-to-play-basketball kids 
Trepanier is so "lucky" to get. Not exactly. She is a senior who came into the 
season with three soccer letters and zero basketball letters. She simply kept 
her wits about her and got the job done. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, what struck me in watching this game was that all these girls remained 
calm and controlled even when things were bleak and time was getting short . . 
. and this was definitely a game that could have gotten away. 
</P>
<P>
It was easy to understand why Point Loma's girls will be playing in their 
seventh Southern California regional championship game in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Because Lee Trepanier will be coaching his seventh regional championship game 
in eight years.

EXTRAORDINARY POLITICAL REFORMS IN HUNGARY ARE EVOKING FEAR AND UNCERTAINTY, 
NOT EUPHORIA. 'ALL THE RULES ARE CHANGED,' ONE PSYCHIATRIST OBSERVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
BUDAPEST, Hungary 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The face of Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth, as he stands before the lame-duck 
Hungarian National Assembly daring it to press a vote of no-confidence, is a 
study in gloom. He wins his argument and averts the vote, but weariness and the 
pessimism registered on his features remains. 
</P>
<P>
The taxi driver, his offers to change money at black-market rates declined, 
sinks back into sullen combat with the traffic, turning up the disco music on 
the radio one more notch. "What the hell," he says. "It makes no difference." 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian-born American manager of the successful lighting manufacturer 
Tungsram, Gyorgy Varga, makes steady rounds among 18,000 employees, 
conspicuously informal in his shirt sleeves and trying to spread Yankee 
optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole country is not in a good mood," Varga says. "We're going to have to 
make a mind change here." 
</P>
<P>
The mood of depression is widespread in Hungary -- and all the more striking 
for the fact that the country is on the verge of free elections, the 
culmination of a long process of reform that will finally, and probably 
irrevocably, remove the Communist Party from power after 42 years. 
</P>
<P>
Given the approach of these long-awaited changes, it would seem more probable 
that this nation of 11 million would be closer to euphoria than gloom. But the 
sense of foreboding, of deep pessimism, is pervasive and obvious, to natives 
and newcomers alike. 
</P>
<P>
The mood of Hungary is also an illustration of the danger, uncertainty and fear 
associated with the transformation of an entire economic, political and social 
system, and a reminder that such changes are not all flag-waving joy for 
new-found liberties. For most people, the change is a nerve-racking process -- 
and, as Hungarians swiftly point out, you don't have to be an ousted Communist 
to feel nervous and embittered. 
</P>
<P>
All serious change, psychologists note, is fraught with uncertainty and fear. 
And the change of a political system is no less fraught than, for example, the 
end of a marriage (even a bad one) or a change in jobs (even to a better one). 
</P>
<P>
"All the rules are changed," Dr. Andras Veer, director of Budapest's largest 
psychiatric hospital, said in a recent interview. "The situation of former 
leaders is up for grabs. But it's not just political. All leadership jobs are 
up for grabs." 
</P>
<P>
And below the leadership level, in offices and factories, in pensioners' 
apartments where the rent is going up and even newspapers are too expensive to 
buy, the less powerful wait in suspense for the effect on their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
Some pessimism here comes from economic uncertainty: 
</P>
<P>
New taxes now take a 30% slice of the average Hungarian's income (10,000 
forints a month, or about $150). 
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index jumped 17% in 1989, 15% the year before that. 
</P>
<P>
One-fifth of the population lives on an income of less than 4,300 forints a 
month (about $65), the officially designated "social minimum." 
</P>
<P>
About 70% of Hungarian men hold more than one job and work up to 14 1/2 hours a 
day, and heart attacks are on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
For Hungarians, Poles and East Germans -- and soon, probably, for Czechoslovaks 
as well -- real incomes are not keeping up, despite the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs, at whatever income, are no longer secure for many people. In Poland, 
unemployment has been growing at the rate of 100,000 per month; the same 
specter looms over Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
At Tungsram, Varga's first order of business will be to trim the payroll; a 
hiring freeze, early retirement plans and attrition, Varga calculates, will cut 
his work force by 2,000 in the next two years. He declines to say much beyond 
that, except to note that there will have to be cuts in white-collar personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many people handling too many pieces of paper," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Judit Gergely, the managing director of Investcenter, an office set up to help 
promote foreign investment and joint ventures with Hungarian concerns, 
sometimes finds herself subject to the pessimism, even though her official 
duties call for the opposite approach. 
</P>
<P>
After a year of trying, and the intercession of the deputy minister of 
telecommunications, she is still unable to get a home telephone, even though it 
is essential to her work, and her work is deemed important to the national 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether I'm depressed or not depends on what time of day you ask me," she 
said, adding: "People are depressed because they are not used to inflation. 
They are not used to dynamism. They don't see opportunity, they see danger." 
</P>
<P>
Few Hungarians, evidently, see any answer in the blossoming of the new 
politics. A recent survey showed that only 45% of the population believes that 
Hungary is ready for democracy. In part, some believe, the pessimism grows out 
of the campaigns of the three or four most important new parties, which focus 
more on blaming the Communists for the nation's problems than on suggesting 
better times might lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
To psychiatrist Veer, the new political parties have added to Hungary's 
psychological burdens, perhaps even unconsciously. He cites two posters, 
displayed all across the country, by two of the leading competitors in the 
March 25 elections, the Hungarian Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Forum posters show the back of a fat neck and head, squeezed 
between a green military hat and collar. "Comrades, goodby," says the legend. 
</P>
<P>
"I have asked many people what they think the meaning of this poster is," Veer 
said, "and almost everyone tells me they think it means a shot to the head." 
</P>
<P>
The most accessible interpretation of the poster, he added, is that the 
unattractive figure represents the Soviet military, but "the identity of the 
'comrade' is not really defined. Everyday people don't take the time to think 
over problems like that. They cannot figure it out. It adds up to frustration." 
</P>
<P>
The other poster, from the Free Democrats, carries the warning, "Those who are 
not with us are with THEM." The last word is underlined in red. 
</P>
<P>
"This suggests that those who are not with the Free Democrats are Communists," 
Veer explained. "It says, 'If I don't think the way they do, I am a Communist, 
and people will hate me.' " 
</P>
<P>
The problem, as Veer sees it, is that "meaning is not articulated, so 
frustration is the result. We know we are frustrated, but we don't know why. . 
. . We wake up with this fear and go to bed with this fear every day. I think 
it is very dangerous to prepare for democracy in this way." 
</P>
<P>
The dark undertone of the Hungarian political campaign is notable in contrast 
to Poland and Czechoslovakia, the two most comparable East Bloc countries. In 
the closing weekend of last year's Solidarity election campaign in Poland, for 
example, a poster appeared showing Gary Cooper, in a still from the movie "High 
Noon," striding forward on his way to a showdown -- in this case, at the ballot 
box. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, Cooper's six-gun was painted out of the picture. And the poster, 
which became an overnight collectors' item, was seen as clever and funny, not 
threatening. 
</P>
<P>
In Czechoslovakia, the revolution that ousted the Communists last November also 
was renowned for its gentle temper and its humor. One student banner, carried 
in the massive demonstrations that led to the change, brought a characteristic 
laugh with its demand: "We want a government with a higher IQ." 
</P>
<P>
A major difference between those two countries and Hungary is that the Polish 
and Czechoslovak populaces had a clear center of opposition to rally around -- 
Solidarity in Warsaw, Civic Forum and Charter 77 in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
The changes in Hungary, meanwhile, were gradual and actually were led by 
figures inside the Communist Party. The new opposition parties, formed in the 
last year, are unknown quantities to most Hungarians, who know they no longer 
want Communists ruling them, but are uncertain how to settle on a successor 
through the continuing dislocations of an economic revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the evidence in Hungary and Poland suggests, Eastern Europeans are in 
for visions that are commonplace enough in the West, but are still wrenching 
here: The old man rummaging through trash barrels for castaway items good 
enough to use or sell, the old woman picking through a box of bones at a meat 
market in search of one with enough gristle attached to make a thin soup. 
</P>
<P>
Janos Hernadi works as a restaurant manager in a first-class Budapest hotel, a 
job that provides him with a good income, a comfortable house, two cars -- and 
a familiar, Western-style, middle-class lament that he can never manage to save 
any money. He is fortunate, he knows, but like many Hungarians, he is caught 
short by the new realities. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to visit my father last weekend," Hernadi recalled recently. "He's 
retired, getting up in years. We were watching television, and I started 
looking around for the newspaper to check the TV schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him where the paper was, and he said, 'Well, I don't buy the newspaper 
every day anymore.' Now, in all my life, I cannot remember my father not buying 
the newspaper every day. I was mortified, embarrassed for not realizing. He 
doesn't buy it because he can no longer afford it. This is a small thing, but 
we see it around us all the time now, and it frightens us." 
</P>
<P>
To Veer, part of the pessimism is, in a sense, uniquely Hungarian, an 
inheritance of history. 
</P>
<P>
"For 1,000 years," he said, "Hungarians have been struggling to gain an 
identity for the nation." And most Hungarians, he observed, believe that 
struggle is still going on. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, for more than 100 years -- as long as anyone has been keeping 
statistics -- Hungarians have led all the world's nations in the rate of 
suicide. The phenomenon is well-known, deeply ingrained and has had nothing to 
do with Communist rule; indeed, the trend was there long before the Communists 
took over in 1948, although they did nothing to diminish it. For years, the 
number of suicides has run about 5,000 annually in a population of 11 million. 
</P>
<P>
However, in each of the last two years the number has declined sharply, to 
about 4,100. It is the kind of drop in the suicide rate that typically occurs 
only in times of war, when the struggle to survive overpowers even overwhelming 
despair. 
</P>
<P>
It is, as Veer suggests, a curiously double-edged statistic, a positive trend 
that shows what a struggle life in Hungary has become.

2ND MENENDEZ SON RETURNING TO SURRENDER

Erik Menendez, accused along with his older brother, Lyle, in the shotgun 
murders of their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion, is returning to Los 
Angeles to give himself up to police, an attorney for his brother said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my understanding that he wants to turn himself in as soon as possible," 
said defense attorney Gerald Chaleff, who is representing Lyle, 22. 
</P>
<P>
Erik, 19, had been in Israel playing in a professional tennis tournament, and 
was reported to have flown to London before transferring to a Los Angeles 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle was arrested by Beverly Hills detectives Thursday and booked on suspicion 
of homicide. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner is expected to announce Monday that both brothers will 
be charged with homicide under "special circumstances," which would mean that 
the pair could receive the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
"I would expect special circumstances because of the grotesqueness of the 
crime," said the chief of detectives of the Beverly Hills Police Department, 
Lt. Russ Olson. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects' father, Jose Menendez, 45, chief executive of Live Entertainment 
Inc. of Van Nuys, a video and music distributor, and his wife, Kitty, 44, were 
slain in a barrage of shotgun blasts at close range while they watched 
television in the first-floor library of their Elm Drive home last Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
As police and prosecutors busied themselves Friday preparing for a Monday 
arraignment hearing, there were these other developments: 
</P>
<P>
It was learned that police have obtained a 12-gauge shotgun shell casing that 
was found by a friend in one of Lyle's jackets. His parents were murdered with 
two 12-gauge shotguns, law enforcement sources have said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he considered the shell casing important evidence, Olson said, "I 
think it will be." 
</P>
<P>
Although the killers -- police said there were two -- picked up the shell 
casings before leaving the house on the night of the murders, investigators 
later found shotgun wadding -- material expended with the shells -- at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
At a minimum, sources said, the casing in police custody could be used as 
circumstantial evidence that Lyle had some familiarity with guns. It was not 
immediately clear whether the wadding matches the single shell that was 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Also, tape recordings between a psychologist and the two brothers, made after 
the murders, have been seized by Beverly Hills detectives and, if admitted into 
evidence, could bolster the prosecution's case, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Police served search warrants Thursday on the psychologist's office and home. 
The tapes that were seized are now being stored pending a court hearing on the 
admissibility of the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
There are believed to be several tapes, although Olson declined to say what was 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
Before the seizure of the tapes from the psychologist, police had been trying 
to poke holes in the alibi of the two sons. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers said they had attended the movie "Batman" on the night of the 
murder and then had gone to a food festival at the Santa Monica Civic 
Auditorium. Finally, they said they had made plans to meet a friend at a 
Beverly Hills restaurant called the Cheesecake Factory. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said police found some inconsistencies in the alibi, but not enough to 
be critically damaging to their defense. 
</P>
<P>
Police also were interested in the sons' behavior after the murders. 
</P>
<P>
Friends said Lyle went on a spending spree that included the purchase of a new 
Porsche, residential property in Princeton, N.J., and, most recently, a 
Princeton restaurant that specialized in chicken wings. 
</P>
<P>
Erik dropped plans to enter UCLA after the murders and launched a professional 
tennis career. 
</P>
<P>
Both brothers traveled extensively, often on the exclusive MGM Grand airline, 
according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they had been developing a considerable amount of circumstantial 
evidence but that only recently did they find "the glue" that enabled them to 
move against the brothers. "The things that came from the psychologist are 
quite helpful," said Olson. "But it (the case) was there without it." 
</P>
<P>
Conversations between a patient and a psychologist are considered confidential 
except in some unusual circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
One is in the case of a person who tells his therapist he intends to physically 
harm someone. Then the therapist has a duty to report it. Another exception is 
when a person tries to enlist the therapist to help him elude prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Sources declined to say under which exception authorities are hoping to use the 
tape recordings. 
</P>
<P>
Some investigators have said greed could be a motive. They pointed out that the 
two sons were the sole heirs to the $14-million Menendez estate. But others who 
saw the gruesome pictures of the victims said rage must also have been 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle had been under surveillance in recent days. In the last week, as police 
moved closer to an arrest, they traveled to Princeton and visited one of Lyle's 
recent acquisitions -- a restaurant called Chuck's Spring Street Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
The Menendez family lived in the Princeton area until 1986, when they moved to 
California. Both brothers attended prep school there and Lyle went to Princeton 
University before he dropped out in 1988, reportedly because of a plagiarism 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"They (detectives) were very nice. They made a comment that the (chicken) wings 
could be hotter," said Gus Tangalos, the restaurant manager. "They introduced 
themselves as friends of Lyle Menendez. They were looking for him." 
</P>
<P>
A friend of Lyle, David Pae Bros, said the detectives "questioned all of Lyle's 
friends on campus. The friends have been shaken up." 
</P>
<P>
After the detectives left, Bros said, Lyle complained that the police were 
harassing him. 
</P>
<P>
"He did not want to speak with the police at all," Bros said. 
</P>
<P>
Bros added that Lyle had been questioned several times by police and it was 
bothering him. 
</P>
<P>
"They (police) constantly followed him around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bros said Lyle had a girlfriend in Princeton who was "in shock" over the 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
He also said Lyle went back to California recently to set up a corporation, 
Menendez Investment Enterprises, which was designed to be a shell for real 
estate ventures. 
</P>
<P>
News of the arrest Thursday was big news in the affluent university town. It 
was the main story of the Daily Princetonian, the undergraduate newspaper, and 
the restaurant owned by Lyle was filled for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer John Goldman in Princeton, N.J., contributed to this story.

HUGHES ADMITS ILLEGALLY DEALING IN DEFENSE DATA 
</P>

<P>
Hughes Aircraft Co. pleaded guilty in federal court Friday to two felony 
charges of trafficking in secret Pentagon budget documents and agreed to pay 
$3.7 million in fines and costs. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, based in El Segundo, Calif., became the fourth major defense contractor 
convicted in a continuing investigation into illegal trading in stolen Pentagon 
papers among military suppliers. GTE Corp., Boeing Co. and RCA Corp. earlier 
pleaded guilty to similar charges and paid large fines. 
</P>
<P>
The case is part of a six-year investigation, dubbed Operation Uncover, into 
defense contractors who trade secret Defense Department documents to win 
competitive advantage. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Henry E. Hudson, who is leading the inquiry, with assistance from 
the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, said that other major contractors 
are likely to be charged soon. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable sources said that Raytheon Co. and Grumman Corp. are among the 
targets of the investigation and are expected to sign plea bargains soon. 
Officers of those companies refused to comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes is the latest in a long list of major defense contractors that have been 
convicted of or pleaded guilty to serious federal charges in the last year. A 
virtual Who's Who of military suppliers has been swept up in Operation Uncover, 
a similar but unrelated inquiry dubbed Ill Wind and other, independent 
investigations of such firms as Northrop Corp., which recently was fined $17 
million for falsifying test data on weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that both the Ill Wind investigation as well as this investigation 
into the trafficking in classified documents have heightened the awareness of 
people in corporate board rooms that there are rules of fair play by which 
procurement must be conducted," Hudson said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
In its plea agreement with federal prosecutors, Hughes admitted that it had 
acquired numerous classified Pentagon planning documents from 1978 through 1985 
and filed them under false titles to conceal them from government auditors. 
</P>
<P>
The reports included five-year defense spending plans, the defense policy 
guidance and acquisition planning papers. All were stamped "Secret" and many 
bore the notation, "Not Releasable to Contractors/Consultants." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said that the documents had been obtained for the company by Frank 
J. Caso, who retired last year as a marketing executive at Hughes' Missile 
Systems Group in Canoga Park. Caso remains under investigation for his role in 
the scheme, government investigators said. He could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes executives said that the company regrets its actions but noted that it 
did not bribe any government officials to obtain the reports, it did not profit 
from them and has not acquired any such documents since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Hughes volunteered information about its role in the 
conspiracy to trade secret documents with other defense industry figures and 
cooperated fully in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wrong and it can't be justified," company spokesman Richard H. Dore said. 
"The company has a pretty good ethics program in place to try to make sure that 
things like this don't occur." 
</P>
<P>
Dore said that the guilty plea and fine were not expected to have a material 
impact on the firm's earnings or operations. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, which was acquired by General Motors Corp. in 1985, is the nation's 
ninth-largest defense contractor, with $3 billion in Pentagon contracts in the 
fiscal year that ended last September. All the offenses occurred before GM 
bought the aerospace concern. 
</P>
<P>
The company was specifically charged with "conveyance without authority" of the 
five-year defense plans prepared for 1983 and 1984. It said Hughes obtained the 
documents through an unnamed third party. 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Costello, a senior official of the Defense Criminal Investigative 
Service, said that Caso, the Hughes executive named in the company's guilty 
plea, was involved in a "tightly knit group" of contractor executives who 
swapped bootleg Pentagon documents among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the price of entry into the group was a valuable internal Defense 
Department document, which was then copied and distributed to the other 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Costello said there may have been no more than a dozen individuals and 
companies involved in the conspiracy. Although scores of valuable government 
planning documents were acquired from Pentagon sources and exchanged among the 
contractors, investigators have found no evidence that any money changed hands, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Costello said that the Defense Criminal Investigative Service had stepped up 
the pace of its investigation because the statute of limitations will expire in 
September for several of the major target firms. He said that the investigative 
service has increased manpower devoted to the inquiry by 40% and shifted 
computer capacity to processing data uncovered in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Boeing pleaded guilty to two similar charges and was ordered to 
pay fines totaling $5.2 million. Former Boeing executive Richard Lee Fowler was 
convicted in December of 39 counts of conspiracy, conveyance without authority 
and fraud and sentenced to two years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, RCA Corp. pleaded guilty to two felony counts of illegal traffic in 
Pentagon documents and agreed to pay $2.75 million in fines. One former and one 
current RCA employee each pleaded guilty to felony charges of participating in 
the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Although similar in nature, Operation Uncover is not related to the Ill Wind 
investigation of corruption in Pentagon weapons buying. More than 30 companies 
and individuals have been convicted or pleaded guilty to crimes in the Ill Wind 
inquiry, which focuses on bribing Pentagon officials for inside information on 
military weapons procurement.

PENTAGON PLANS $877-MILLION ANTI-DRUG EFFORT; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: THE EXPANDED INITIATIVES INCLUDE SPECIAL TRAINING AND SURVEILLANCE. 
IT IS A REVERSAL OF DEFENSE DEPARTMENT RELUCTANCE TO JOIN THE WAR ON NARCOTICS.

<P>
The Pentagon, unveiling an $877-million package of military drug-fighting 
initiatives, said Friday it plans to erect an "aerostat fence" along the 
southern border and increase the total steaming, training and flying hours 
dedicated to halting the flow of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said that, as of Jan. 1, more ships, aircraft and military 
personnel got their marching orders to join the war on drugs, reversing years 
of military reluctance to participate in what the Pentagon's drug chief once 
called "the President's crusade." 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in a statement released by the Pentagon, said: 
"We will act swiftly, methodically and in accordance with our nation's laws and 
traditions" to take part in the coordinated anti-drug campaign initiated by 
President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Defense officials were quick to note that, even though the Pentagon clearly is 
expanding its participation in the drug war, the military's role in the 
campaign will be subject to strict limits. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, National Guardsmen and active-duty soldiers, accompanied by 
military drug-sniffing dogs, will help U.S. Customs Service agents inspect 
cargo for drugs under the Pentagon proposal. But the military personnel will 
focus on surveillance, passing information to U.S. and foreign law enforcement 
authorities who would perform actual arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Although the new strategy does not assign any new anti-drug missions to the 
Defense Department, Pentagon officials said it represents a significant 
commitment of additional resources to the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It is more of the same, but it is substantially more of the same," said 
Stephen M. Duncan, the Pentagon's drug czar. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan warned, however, that U.S. efforts would take a long time to bear fruit 
and said the effectiveness of the military's participation could not be 
measured by increased arrests or drug seizures. 
</P>
<P>
While some in Congress have long urged an increased military role in the 
anti-drug war, critics have complained that military operations are costly and 
less effective than civilian education, treatment and interdiction efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's plans also increased concerns among some lawmakers and public 
interest groups that the military's expanded role could further erode the legal 
doctrine that bars servicemen and servicewomen from participating in law 
enforcement functions. 
</P>
<P>
"I greatly fear for our civil liberties as the traditional separation between 
the civilian and the military is further breached," said Rep. Don Edwards 
(D-San Jose), who characterized the military expansion as "enormous" and "very 
shocking." 
</P>
<P>
The armed services plan to step up their provision of intelligence, 
communications and logistics support, as well as interdiction training, to 
local drug-fighting efforts in the cocaine-producing countries of Colombia, 
Peru and Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
Defense officials said, for instance, that special U.S. military teams will 
help train and equip Colombian, Peruvian and Bolivian forces to conduct 
operations along South America's vast river networks. 
</P>
<P>
In the Caribbean Sea, four to five ships will ply the heavily trafficked area 
daily in search of drug runners, an operational increase of about 80%. Flight 
hours by U.S. surveillance aircraft will rise by 220% this year over 1989's 
level, Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pacific, U.S. naval forces that previously played a minor role in 
gathering drug-related intelligence will see a "dramatic increase" in their 
efforts, the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy ships operating out of Pacific Command ports will devote the equivalent of 
867 days of patrol to waters close to Asian nations and nearer to the United 
States in search of drug traffickers. That would represent a 146% increase in 
the Pacific drug-fighting efforts by surface ships. Navy warplanes would 
increase drug-related patrols by 24%.

American military forces already have broken new ground by joining in efforts 
to eradicate marijuana fields on federal lands in the Hawaiian Islands. Under 
the Pentagon plan, active-duty forces and National Guardsmen would conduct 
similar operations over state lands if requested. 
</P>
<P>
The military's "aerostat fence" -- 15 sensor-laden balloons and blimps strung 
across the southern U.S. border -- would be completed by 1992, defense 
officials said. Their gaze would be supplemented by 44 ground-based radar 
installations along the border. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 50 American interceptor aircraft would remain on alert to 
"scramble" toward potential drug traffickers and monitor their approach to U.S. 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Lawrence Izzo, a military planner for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that 
while U.S. warplanes would not be able to open fire on suspected drug 
traffickers, they would operate under guidelines that permit them to defend 
themselves if fired on. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan said that Cheney has agreed to begin a cooperative study by the Defense 
Department and the Justice Department's Bureau of Prisons to investigate how 
Defense Department facilities could be used to house overflow prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
In a proposal expected to bring an expanded military presence to Long Beach, 
Duncan said that the Pentagon will establish four new regional logistics 
support offices around the nation -- slated for New York, Florida, California 
and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
While officials have not identified the sites, a Defense Department source said 
that Long Beach appears to be the principal location under consideration in 
California.

LEBANON: HE MAKES A CONCILIATORY MOVE TO MUSLIM LEADERS AND A CHRISTIAN FOE. HE

Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun appealed Friday for an end to Lebanon's 15-year-old civil 
war, making a conciliatory move to Muslim leaders and a Christian warlord he 
has tried to crush in more than a month of battles. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun also dropped his outright opposition to the peace accord and power-sharing 
agreement worked out by Lebanon's Parliament in October. 
</P>
<P>
Police said a week-old cease-fire between Aoun's 19,000 troops and the 
6,000-member Lebanese Forces militia of Samir Geagea was holding despite minor 
exchanges of sniper fire. 
</P>
<P>
At least 750 people have been killed and 2,089 wounded during the inconclusive 
showdown for control of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, police said rival Shiite Muslim militias loyal to Syria 
and Iran clashed in South Beirut and southern Lebanon, but there were no 
reports of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
The Shiite clashes came two days after a Beirut firefight between the two 
groups that left two people dead and three wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The two factions have been fighting sporadically for more than two years for 
dominance among Shiites, the nation's largest sect. 
</P>
<P>
The war between the two Shiite militias has left 1,030 people dead and 3,046 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun, in an unusually conciliatory statement to the newspaper An Nahar, said 
there will be no more clashes among Christians or between Christians and 
Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun told the newspaper he wants "dialogue with everyone" to find a settlement. 
He stressed that there will be peace in the Christian enclave as well as along 
the areas separating Christian territory from the Muslim sectors. 
</P>
<P>
The general also dropped his rejection of an Arab League peace plan brokered 
last year in the Saudi Arabian city of Taif. 
</P>
<P>
"Abrogating the Taif accord is not necessary to launch a dialogue," Aoun said. 
</P>
<P>
He did call, however, for unspecified amendments to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun originally rejected the accord because it did not include a timetable for 
the withdrawal of Syria's 40,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun described the inconclusive intra-Christian showdown as "self-destructive" 
and called on Geagea to declare his "readiness for dialogue so we can meet." 
</P>
<P>
"Once two people manage to meet, they can invite others," Aoun said.

Unofficial American negotiators have had direct contacts with the captors of at 
least 16 Westerners believed held in Lebanon and are working on a deal to pay 
ransom for the hostages' releases, the leading Lebanese magazine As Shiraa said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
As Shiraa, which has good contacts among Islamic fundamentalists and is the 
magazine that first broke the Iran-Contra scandal story, said Anglican Church 
envoy Terry Waite may be the first hostage freed in the proposed deal. 
</P>
<P>
Waite, 50, was abducted Jan. 20, 1987, in Muslim West Beirut while negotiating 
the release of Western hostages held by Muslim extremists in secret hideouts in 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The deal would involve all the Western hostages believed held by pro-Iranian 
Shiite extremists in Lebanon, including eight Americans, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
"U.S. figures with no official capacity have been engaged in direct contacts 
with the captors, focusing on a proposed deal to pay some money in exchange for 
releasing hostages," As Shiraa said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk said he was 
unaware of any such dealings, but again noted, "There are plenty of people out 
there talking," trying to win release of the hostages.

SOVIETS TO END NUCLEAR TESTS AT ASIA SITE

The Soviet Union, bowing to extraordinary political pressure from its citizens, 
has decided to end underground nuclear explosions at its principal test site in 
South-Central Asia within three years and move a sharply reduced atomic testing 
program to a remote island within the Arctic circle, according to Soviet and 
U.S. sources. 
</P>
<P>
The move, announced in Moscow this week by a senior defense official at a 
hearing of the Supreme Soviet legislature, is aimed at satisfying residents 
near the Semipalatinsk test site in rural Kazakhstan who claim they repeatedly 
have been exposed to radiation generated by the detonations. 
</P>
<P>
But the shift to an Arctic test site will force a reduction in the number of 
nuclear tests and hinder development of weapons that could be used against the 
United States and its allies, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
A special committee of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences determined last 
year that residents had experienced excess cancers, genetic diseases and child 
mortality because of radiation exposure while nuclear tests were conducted 
above ground prior to the U.S.-Soviet Limited Test Ban in 1963.

100 ARRESTED AS SOUTH AFRICA LAUNCHES MASSIVE CRACKDOWN ON POLITICAL UNREST

The government of President Frederik W. de Klerk arrested more than 100 people 
in two provinces Friday in the first major crackdown on political unrest in the 
country since the unveiling of a racial reform program five weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Police said at least 19 blacks died in fighting in one township overnight in a 
battle between rival taxi operators that has overwhelmed local hospitals and 
continued to rage despite appeals for peace by anti-apartheid leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Ruben Bloomberg, a police spokesman in Pretoria, said 53 blacks were 
detained in overnight sweeps in the central Orange Free State province and 10 
others in the northern Transvaal province under regulations of a 44-month-old 
state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Another 67 people, all whites, were arrested on charges of obstructing police 
when they tried to disrupt a protest march by black schoolteachers in the 
central city of Welkom. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the whites, mostly farmers, were armed with whips and other 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests coincided with one of the worst outbreaks of political unrest in 
the country since the June, 1986, imposition of the state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
The unrest has intensified since De Klerk lifted a 30-year ban on the African 
National Congress five weeks ago and has spread to the nominally independent 
black homelands.

SOVIET GEORGIA DEMANDS TALKS FOR INDEPENDENCE

The Parliament of the Soviet republic of Georgia on Friday condemned its 
forcible annexation to the Soviet Union more than half a century ago and 
demanded talks on restoration of its independence, a local news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia thus becomes the fourth of the 15 Soviet republics, after Latvia, 
Lithuania and Estonia, to take action condemning its incorporation into the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania's Parliament is expected to vote on a formal declaration of 
independence on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Georgian Parliament, called the Supreme Soviet, also condemned a proposal 
made by Mikhail S. Gorbachev to create a strong Soviet presidency, according to 
a transcript of the resolution read to the Associated Press over the telephone 
by the Independent News Agency of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution said the law, which would allow the president to declare a state 
of emergency and martial law, introduces "an authoritarian presidential rule, 
which may be interpreted as the president's right to remove organs of power . . 
. and thus to completely eliminate the republic's sovereignty." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev hopes to win approval of the constitutional amendment in Monday's 
special session of the Congress of People's Deputies, despite progressives' 
complaints that the draft would give him "dictatorial" powers. It is widely 
assumed Gorbachev would be elected to the post at the same session. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia has long had an active independence movement, but has not pushed its 
case through parliamentary means. Many Georgian independence leaders said that 
would be tacit admission of Soviet power even though the Baltics have won 
greater autonomy and edged closer to independence by using Gorbachev's reforms 
to elect trusted local leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The official news agency Tass reported that the Georgian Parliament had adopted 
a resolution saying the presidency proposal restricts sovereign rights of the 
republic. But Tass said nothing in its four-sentence report about the section 
of the resolution condemning the Red Army's occupation of Georgia in February, 
1921, and the subsequent treaties incorporating Georgia as part of the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
According to the independent news agency, the text states, "The Supreme Soviet 
of Georgia denounces the occupation and annexation of Georgia by Soviet Russia 
and considers it to be an international crime." It calls the entrance of troops 
"a military interference, intervention and occupation with the aim of 
overthrowing the existing political order." 
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to start talks on restoration of an independent state of 
Georgia," the resolution says. 
</P>
<P>
The republic is in the southern Caucasus and borders Turkey between the Caspian 
and Black seas.

SOVIET UNION AGREES TO WITHDRAW TROOPS FROM HUNGARY BY MID-'91

The Soviet Union reached agreement with Hungary on Friday to withdraw all its 
troops from Hungary by the middle of 1991, after having them there 
"temporarily" since the end of World War II, the Hungarian MTI news agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a report from Moscow, it said withdrawal of the 50,000 troops will begin 
next Monday and be finished by June 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was initialed in Moscow on Friday by senior Soviet and Hungarian 
officials and will be signed in the Soviet capital today by Foreign Ministers 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Gyula Horn, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow's accord with Hungary follows a similar agreement with Czechoslovakia 
that also sets a deadline of June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Talks on the troop withdrawal broke down in Budapest last week when the Soviet 
delegation led by Deputy Foreign Minister Ivan Aboimov insisted the pullout 
could not be completed until the end of August, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
A Hungarian delegation headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Ferenc Somogyi had 
gone to Moscow on Friday to resolve remaining issues after senior officials in 
Budapest said they were confident the accord could be signed today as 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"No Soviet soldiers or Soviet property will remain in Hungary after the date 
set down, and real estate will also be handed back," MTI quoted Somogyi as 
telling Hungarian reporters in Moscow after he initialed the accord with 
Aboimov.

Soviet troops began a partial withdrawal in 1989.

MONGOLIAN COMMUNISTS OFFER TO RESIGN IN FACE OF PROTESTS

Mongolia's Communist leaders offered to resign Friday in the face of protests 
by thousands of people calling for multi-party democracy, East Bloc news 
agencies reported from the capital Ulan Bator. 
</P>
<P>
The East German news agency ADN and the Soviet news agency Tass also said a 
national referendum will be organized to give the people an opportunity to say 
whether they had confidence in the Mongolian Parliament, the People's Great 
Hural. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by Mongolian President and Communist Party leader Jambyn 
Batmonh marked the first time the revolution sweeping through the Communist 
bloc has threatened a regime in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's events brought the wave of political reform to the doorstep of China, 
which crushed its own democracy movement last spring with the army attack on 
protesters in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators crowded the vast central square of Ulan Bator on Friday to demand 
a new constitution and creation of a provisional congress with the 
participation of all public forces, Tass said. Early reports said the square 
was teeming with thousands of protesters. 
</P>
<P>
Many speakers called for a general strike starting today, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
Batmonh responded Friday evening on national television with the promise that 
the Communist Party's Central Committee will meet Monday to consider the 
resignation of the top leaders in the Politburo and the convening of a special 
party congress, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said members of the Mongolian Democratic Union and other public movements 
ended their three-day hunger strike after the announcement Friday.

CLEAN AIR BILL STALLED BY PROPOSAL TO AID COAL MINERS

<P>
Senate leaders and the White House faced new obstacles Friday to passage of 
clean air legislation because of discord over providing $700 million to help 
coal miners who lose their jobs because of stricter pollution controls. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to resolve that dispute, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) put off further votes on the bill until the Senate returns from its 
upcoming weeklong recess. 
</P>
<P>
"It has become apparent that we cannot complete action on the bill . . . this 
week," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
The senators adjourned late Friday and will not reconvene until March 20, when 
the clean air bill will be the first order of business, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Senate leaders had been prepared Thursday night to bring the coal miner 
amendment to a vote, but action was postponed when they grew uncertain about 
their ability to defeat the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment is one of a string of proposed changes that would alter the 
compromise reached between Senate leaders and the White House in closed 
negotiations. Senate leaders have said they would oppose any such amendments. 
</P>
<P>
The coal miner amendment was offered by Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W. Va.), who 
described it as a "safety net" for up to 5,000 miners who stand to lose their 
jobs because of tougher acid rain pollution controls. It would provide miners 
with up to four years of full or part salary if their job loss is attributed to 
the new controls. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd originally had sought assistance costing nearly $1.4 billion over six 
years, but then cut that by half in a bid to gain support. But the Bush 
Administration told Senate leaders that the measure is still too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
"If this amendment is passed, it's over," Senate Minority Bob Dole of Kansas 
said during debate Thursday night. He said Administration officials had told 
him that President Bush could not support a compromise bill that includes the 
coal miner provision. "The Administration doesn't like this amendment one bit, 
and that would be an understatement," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said Friday that negotiations were under way among Senate leaders, 
Byrd and the Administration to try to work out a settlement but that no vote 
would be taken on the amendment until after the Senate returns. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm willing to let the dice role," Byrd said on the Senate floor Friday, 
noting that he was prepared to put the matter to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell had threatened to hold the senators in session into today if necessary 
to work out key provisions of the clean air legislation. But he canceled those 
plans Friday because of the impasse over the coal miner assistance issue. 
</P>
<P>
Among amendments still pending are several that would strengthen pollution 
controls, including those on automobiles. 
</P>

Several of those measures, especially a call for a second round of auto 
emission controls and broader alternative fuels programs, are opposed by the

BUDGET: PRESIDENT CALLS FOR CAUTION IN ASSISTING EMERGING DEMOCRACIES. CONGRESS 
SEES HIS POSITION AS A FAILURE TO CAPITALIZE ON GLOBAL CHANGES.

<P>
The Bush Administration is heading for a major political confrontation with 
Congress over how to assist the newly emerging democracies in Eastern Europe 
and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides know a good political issue when they see one. Rep. Dante B. Fascell 
(D-Fla.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, says voter sentiment 
for increasing foreign aid -- all but absent during most of the 1980s -- is now 
higher than at any time since the Marshall Plan was started in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to help the emerging democracies," Fascell exulted. 
</P>
<P>
But the White House, hemmed in by the huge federal budget deficit and President 
Bush's steadfast refusal to raise taxes, argues that a dose of caution is in 
order. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger warns that the fragile 
Eastern European and Central American economies are not capable of absorbing 
massive amounts of aid. Eagleburger recalls how America "dumped" money into 
Poland in the late 1970s, only to see it pay for consumer goods rather than 
productive new factories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must 'Act Boldly' 
</P>
<P>
To congressional Democrats, the Administration's hesitancy amounts to nothing 
short of a failure to capitalize on sweeping changes around the globe -- the 
democratic tide in six Eastern European countries, the ouster of Panamanian 
strongman Manuel A. Noriega and the electoral defeat of Nicaragua's Marxist 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"America must think creatively and act boldly," asserted House Majority Leader 
Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who fired the Democrats' first major salvo at 
the Administration Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
He announced an eight-point Democratic plan for additional aid and trade 
benefits for the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration contends that the emerging democracies often can benefit as 
much from trade, technology, investment and U.S. business expertise as from 
outright cash. It argues that in some countries -- such as Romania and Bulgaria 
-- the United States should wait for genuine movement toward democracy before 
parceling out substantial aid. "A new democratic differentiation," Eagleburger 
called it last week. 
</P>
<P>
Congress and the Administration have three basic choices: They can increase the 
foreign aid budget, cutting defense spending or domestic programs to foot the 
bill; they can slash aid to other countries to provide funds for grants to 
Eastern Europe and Central America, or they can simply allow the United States 
to take a smaller role in influencing developments in these regions -- leaving 
it to other donors, such as Japan, to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration is trying a little of each. It has asked Congress for a 
beefed-up foreign aid budget and more authority to determine which countries 
should benefit. And it has been trying to persuade other major industrial 
nations -- particularly Japan -- to shoulder more of the burden. 
</P>
<P>
At last weekend's meeting in Palm Springs, Calif., Bush persuaded Japanese 
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu to help provide relief money for Panama and 
Nicaragua. Japan promptly announced that it will offer aid to Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ceding Influence 
</P>
<P>
To critics of this approach, it smacks of an abdication of responsibility. 
Robert E. Hunter of Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies 
said the United States is ceding worldwide influence to Japan even though the 
Japanese "are not capable yet of providing the leadership." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Administration is seeking both to increase the foreign 
aid budget and to increase its own authority to spend the aid as it chooses, 
free of congressional mandates. 
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1970s, Congress has insisted on earmarking specific amounts of 
aid for particular countries -- often down to individual programs. Now, the 
Administration is pleading for the flexibility to shift foreign aid money from 
some parts of the world to Eastern Europe and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleburger complained Tuesday that congressional micromanagement of the 
foreign aid program "ties our hands" and makes it "impossible to respond to the 
new developments and changes" in Eastern Europe and other regions. A House 
Foreign Affairs Committee task force came to the same conclusion last year and 
recommended reducing or even eliminating the practice. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III has proposed shaving every country's 
allocation and channeling the money into a central pool that Bush could use -- 
in consultation with Congress, the Administration promises -- to finance the 
aid for the emerging democracies. Bush strategists say they would use the 
rechanneled money for Eastern Europe, Panama, Nicaragua, the Caribbean and 
Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
But most lawmakers seem unwilling to yield authority. "Every Administration 
wants to have it -- and they ain't going to get it," Fascell asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Many members of Congress believe that earmarking funds gives them more leverage 
over the Administration and over foreign governments. And some use foreign aid 
to please local constituencies, such as Jewish groups and Greek-American 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has proposed a $20.8-billion foreign aid budget for fiscal 
1991, up $1.7 billion from the current year. Some countries' allocations were 
cut to provide funds for six new proposals: 
</P>
<P>
 -- $300 million for Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $500 million for Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $441 million in drug-interdiction aid for the Andean countries. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $888 million to clear up arrears on U.S. payments to the United Nations and 
other international organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $270 million to build a new U.S. Embassy in Moscow, to replace the one that 
is riddled with electronic bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- $70 million for admitting 27,000 more refugees from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
And now that Nicaragua has elected a friendly government, the Administration 
can be expected to seek aid for that country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Budget Bolstered 
</P>
<P>
If anything, Capitol Hill strategists say, Congress will sharply increase the 
Administration's proposals for Panama and Eastern Europe, as it did for Poland 
and Hungary last year. Fascell proposed formally last week adding $2 billion to 
Bush's foreign aid budget, and some Democratic lawmakers are calling for even 
more. 
</P>
<P>
By far the most controversial plan for obtaining the money has come from Senate 
Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. Earlier this month, Dole stunned Washington 
by suggesting the unthinkable -- slashing aid to Israel and Egypt, which 
together receive about half the total current foreign aid budget, and trimming 
payments to other big recipients as well. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way we're going to pay for new aid . . . is to make some tough 
calls," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dole's proposal has not attracted widespread support, it has sparked a 
serious debate on Capitol Hill. Members of Congress now seem nearly unanimous 
in wanting to dig into the defense budget to find the additional foreign aid 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to have a $10-billion peace dividend, you may as well use $2 
billion of it for foreign aid," a key House strategist said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee 
on foreign aid, has drafted a broad plan for shifting money from the military 
aid budget. The lawmakers may also jettison the Administration's requests to 
catch up on U.S. arrears to the United Nations and to replace the bug-plagued 
U.S. Embassy in Moscow. "You don't need an awful lot to get what it takes," 
Obey insisted. 
</P>
<P>
This year's foreign aid debate is the most explosive since the late 1970s, when 
President Jimmy Carter coaxed Israel and Egypt to make peace in return for 
promises of billions of dollars each in added U.S. aid. "I can't even remember" 
when the issue has been this visible, said Hunter, a White House strategist 
during the Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans and Democrats agree the aid dispute must be settled soon, or 
America could miss the chance to help shape the course of events in Eastern 
Europe the way it did in Western Europe after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is whether we're going to be serious about playing a role in the 
outside world," said Hunter of the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies. "The United States spent somewhere between $1 trillion and $2 trillion 
in Europe containing the Soviet Union during the Cold War years. Surely now we 
can spend some of that on peace -- to consolidate those gains."

IDAHO HOUSE OKS STIFFEST ABORTION CURBS IN NATION

<TEXT>
<P>
The state House of Representatives voted 47 to 36 on Friday to approve a bill 
that would give Idaho the most restrictive abortion law in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which now goes to the Senate, would make abortions illegal in the 
state as a means of birth control. 
</P>
<P>
It would ban all abortions except in cases of incest, profound physical or 
mental disability of the fetus or threats to the life or the health of the 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
The House approved amendments that sponsors said strengthened the 
constitutionality of the measure. One amendment would make all abortions 
illegal in Idaho after fetal viability, except when the life of the mother is 
endangered. Fetal viability, that point when a fetus can survive outside the 
womb, is usually reached after 20 to 23 weeks of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
The National Right to Life Committee, which helped draft the bill, hopes it 
will become the test case that could force the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse 
Roe vs. Wade. Supporters believe it would halt up to 93% of abortions in Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents argue that the measure is broadly unconstitutional and will cost the 
state up to $1 million to defend in court.

NEW U.S. SURGEON GENERAL SWORN IN AT WHITE HOUSE

Dr. Antonia Novello was sworn in Friday as the nation's surgeon general, and 
President Bush made it clear that he expects no letup in the anti-smoking and 
anti-drug abuse crusades of her predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief White House ceremony, Bush saluted the new appointee and Health and 
Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, himself a fervent critic of tobacco 
use. 
</P>
<P>
"My respect and appreciation of my good friend Lou Sullivan grows every day as 
he fights for the good health of our people," Bush said. "In the few minutes 
we've been here, 11 people have died from smoking, 390,000 people each year." 
</P>
<P>
Novello said her motto would be "good science and good sense," and she thanked 
Bush for an appointment she said should be an inspiration to women and 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"The American dream is well and alive," said Novello, the first woman and first 
Latino to serve as surgeon general. "Once a dream, it is now my pledge: to be a 
good doctor for all who live in this great country." 
</P>
<P>
Novello, 44, is a native of Puerto Rico. On hand for the ceremony was the 
governor of Puerto Rico, Rafael Hernandez Colon, who told Bush: "I'm here 
representing the pride of all the people of Puerto Rico at this moment." 
</P>
<P>
Novello, who succeeds C. Everett Koop, is a pediatrician who has specialized in 
AIDS and kidney disease in children. 
</P>
<P>
The surgeon general officially is the leader of the 6,500-member Public Health 
Service, but Koop and others before him used the post as a bully pulpit to 
influence government policy on smoking, AIDS and other health-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
Bush mentioned drug and alcohol abuse and AIDS as among the challenges facing 
Novello. "The tasks ahead are difficult," he said. "Because so many of these 
problems begin with our children, it is only right that we ask a pediatrician 
to help."

FAA GROUNDS PLANE CREW CHARGED WITH DRINKING

The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday revoked the licenses of three 
Northwest Airlines crew members charged with flying from Fargo, N.D., to 
Minneapolis under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
The three Boeing 727 crew members -- a captain, second officer and flight 
engineer -- were taken into custody by airport police officers Thursday morning 
at the gate in Minneapolis after a citizen's arrest by an FAA inspector. 
</P>
<P>
He had received an anonymous tip that the three had been drinking in the Fargo 
area Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
A Northwest spokesman said that there had been no irregularities during the 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
FAA regulations prohibit drinking within eight hours of flying a plane. 
Northwest has a stricter rule -- 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Federal air regulations also prohibit flying a plane with a blood-alcohol level 
of .04 or more. 
</P>
<P>
FAA Administrator James B. Busey issued a statement saying: "Safety and alcohol 
do not mix. We have taken quick and effective action in this case, and we will 
take equally forceful action against any other pilot who violates the agency's 
regulations against alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gibbons, director of media relations for Northwest, said it is "wholly 
appropriate" for the FAA to take any action it feels necessary, and that the 
Northwest investigation continues. 
</P>
<P>
The crew members have 10 days to protest the FAA action. 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated move, the FAA fined Northwest $200,000 for improper maintenance 
in an incident Jan. 4 over Florida in which a chunk of "blue ice" broke off the 
fuselage of a Boeing 727 and knocked off an engine. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA said a faulty valve on a lavatory leaked, causing ice to form outside 
the plane. It said the valve leak had been reported several times but was not 
properly repaired. The 727 flew 53 flights with the faulty valve, the agency 
said.

CAMERA TAPES 4 CONFRONTING WOUNDED MAN

Four suspected gang members shot a man inside a La Puente liquor store and 
chased him to a nearby hamburger stand where a security camera taped the 
confrontation, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ray Baytos, Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman, said Jose Alvarado, 22, 
of El Monte was shot once in the stomach at 5:30 p.m. Thursday in the liquor 
store but managed to drive himself to a nearby Gabby's hamburger stand. It was 
there, Baytos said, that the four alleged gang members confronted Alvarado 
again and were videotaped by a security camera.

OAKLAND GIVES DAVIS UNTIL NOON MONDAY TO DECIDE ON RAIDERS MOVE

If Oakland authorities thought they could force Los Angeles Raiders owner Al 
Davis to meet a 5 p.m. Friday deadline for giving an answer on whether his 
football team would move back to Oakland, they had another think coming. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours before the deadline, and nearly three years after he first started 
talking about the possibility of moving his team from Los Angeles, Davis got a 
postponement until noon on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson and the chairman of the Alameda County Board of 
Supervisors, Don Perata, dropped for now their threat to cancel a Monday night 
joint meeting of the Board of Supervisors and the Oakland City Council at which 
formal approval of a $660-million offer to the Raiders is to be considered. 
</P>
<P>
They said Davis had given them "very sound" personal reasons for delaying his 
announcement of a decision, but they would not say what they were. 
</P>
<P>
"My own gut feeling, I'm inclined to think they're coming," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, a source familiar with talks between the Los Angeles 
Coliseum's private business managers and Davis said that Ed Snider, head of 
Spectacor Management Group, would probably talk again to the Raiders owner over 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
But the source said there are not many reasons for Los Angeles to be optimistic 
about keeping the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
He said the chances seem smaller now that Snider will be willing to make an 
advance payment to the Raiders, as a promise of eventual Coliseum renovations, 
which the team could keep if the project were not accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
MCA Inc., Spectacor's partner in the private management of the Coliseum, is 
unwilling to join in such a payment, the source said, and Snider himself is 
dubious of committing Spectacor alone to make it. The source said Snider has 
not yet finished negotiating a private lease of the Coliseum grounds with the 
Coliseum Commission and he believes if he gave millions of dollars to Davis, 
Spectacor would would lose leverage in the commission negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
While not ruling out a change of mind by Snider, the source said it seems more 
likely that Davis will move to Oakland rather than risk getting neither advance 
money nor accomplishment of the project from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Los Angeles is a victim of timing," the source said. "The Coliseum 
commissioners have waited so long to make their final arrangements for a ground 
lease and (revamping) the Coliseum that Snider has very little to offer Davis." 
</P>
<P>
"The funny thing is, he has the impression that Al Davis wants to stay in Los 
Angeles," the source said. "We're chasing him out of town." 
</P>
<P>
However, Coliseum Commissioner Richard Riordan said Friday night that finding 
someone to blame for not reaching a deal "is irrelevant. Our consultants, the 
private managers and I should have been pushing it," he said. "Nobody was 
pushing it." 
</P>
<P>
But, Riordan added, he still believes if Davis waits two weeks, a Los Angeles 
deal will come together. 
</P>
<P>
In Oakland, meanwhile, Wilson, Perata and George Vukasin, the chairman of the 
Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Commission, waited most of the day to hear from 
Davis. Finally, about 3 p.m., Davis called and they had a 20-minute 
conversation with him. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and Perata, at a news conference later, said Davis gave them "private 
assurances" that they felt comfortable with, but they would not discuss their 
content. 
</P>
<P>
Perata said that if, on Monday, Davis says only "maybe" his team is coming, 
that "would not suffice" and there would be no need for a meeting to approve 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, Wilson said, "it's over on Monday" one way or 
another. 
</P>
<P>
Reich reported from Los Angeles and Zamora from Oakland.

SEIZURE OF THERAPY RECORDS IS RARE, FACES CHALLENGE IN MENENDEZ CASE

<P>
Police seizure of a psychologist's records of therapy sessions is extremely 
rare and, in the Menendez case, will almost certainly be the subject of a legal 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"There definitely will be a challenge because in my opinion, the seizure is 
clearly a violation of the law," said Gerald Chaleff, attorney for Lyle 
Menendez, who, with his brother, has been accused in the shooting deaths of his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Conversations between patients and psychotherapists are ordinarily secret. 
State law says they are not to be disclosed by the psychotherapist even in 
civil or criminal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
However, there are exceptions to the secrecy rule that prosecutors could cite. 
</P>
<P>
The two main ones are these: If the psychotherapist believes the patient is a 
serious threat to himself or others, courts have held that the psychotherapist 
has an obligation to warn those in danger. If the patient is using the 
psychotherapist as part of some plan to commit a crime or cover one up, the 
psychotherapist is also free to talk. 
</P>
<P>
However, the law distinguishes between crimes committed in the past and those 
that might be committed in the future. If the patient merely confesses to a 
past crime, the psychotherapist is legally bound to keep the patient's secret. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say I'm a patient and I . . . confess to my psychologist that I killed 
somebody last year -- or yesterday," said Win Schachter, a psychologist and 
lawyer who is executive director of the California Psychological Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The psychotherapist has "a legal duty not to report that information." If he 
does report it, he could be sued for malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the secrecy is that the Legislature has said it recognizes that 
psychotherapy is "dependent upon the fullest revelation of the most intimate 
and embarrassing details of the patient's life. . . . Unless a patient . . . is 
assured that such information can and will be held in utmost confidence, he 
will be reluctant to make the full disclosure upon which diagnosis and 
treatment . . . depends." 
</P>
<P>
In strengthening what is known as the "psychotherapist-patient privilege" to 
keep a secret, the Legislature in 1965 declared that some seriously disturbed 
people were refusing treatment because they feared that therapists would 
disclose what they said. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature said "the interests of society will be better served if 
(psychotherapists) are able to assure patients that their confidences will be 
protected." 
</P>
<P>
State law nonetheless provides a procedure in which police can seize records, 
using a search warrant, from a psychotherapist who is not himself a suspect in 
a crime. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain a warrant to search under this statute, police need to convince a 
judge that they have good reason to believe they will find evidence of a crime. 
The judge then appoints an independent attorney, known as a "special master," 
to carry out the search. Special masters are also used in searches of lawyers' 
offices to make certain police do not look into files they are not authorized 
to. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of legal experts said Friday that they had never heard of the 
procedure specified in the statute, Penal Code Section 1524, being applied to a 
psychotherapist. 
</P>
<P>
Under the procedure, the special master seizes the records. If the 
psychotherapist objects -- as he is legally obligated to -- the special master 
seals the records and takes them to court. There, a judge holds a hearing to 
determine if the records should remain secret or be given to the police. 
</P>
<P>
In the Menendez case, however, police first reviewed the seized materials, 
which were tape recordings, then turned them over to the special master pending 
a court hearing, according to a law enforcement source. 
</P>
<P>
What the tape recordings say is not clear. However, they are apparently 
significant. District attorney spokesman Mike Botula has been quoted as saying 
that Lyle Menendez was arrested after "newly discovered evidence (turned up) in 
the case, which involved conversations that he and his brother had with a 
psychiatrist after the killings." 
</P>
<P>
Chaleff, the lawyer for Lyle Menendez, said he was unaware that police had 
examined the evidence, but said, "If law enforcement authorities have listened, 
or read, or in any way obtained any information from the files, then it's 
clearly a violation of 1524." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to assume that police have indeed reviewed materials prematurely, other 
legal experts said it was unclear whether courts would block prosecutors from 
using the materials as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Myrna Raeder, professor of law at Southwestern University School of Law and 
chairwoman of the American Bar Assn.'s committee on rules of evidence and 
criminal procedure, said, "I think you can make an argument on either side." 
She said a court might allow the evidence if it construed the violation to be 
merely technical. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor and police could argue that they relied in good faith on the 
judgments of the special master, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing after seizure of the materials, the psychotherapist is entitled 
to argue that the materials should not be disclosed to the police because to do 
so would violate his psychotherapist-patient privilege. 
</P>
<P>
Raeder said prosecutors could argue that the Menendez brothers had waived their 
privilege by disclosing the content of their psychotherapy sessions to others. 
</P>
<P>
Or, she speculated, prosecutors might argue that they were entitled to pierce 
the privilege because the brothers were an ongoing threat to others, or because 
they had told the psychologist before their parents died that they intended to 
kill them. If that is the case, it could be argued the psychologist had a duty 
to disclose the threat.

SIX WOMEN FILE FOR TOP STATE POSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With six highly visible women leading the way, the first formal step toward 
what may be a major change in California in the 1990s was taken Friday as all 
candidates for the June 5 primary had to file their declarations of candidacy 
or be left off the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein will be on the 
Democratic ballot for governor against Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and 
several lesser-known candidates. 
</P>
<P>
With the aid of a much-talked-about TV ad, Feinstein moved ahead of Van de Kamp 
by 19 points in the most recent Los Angeles Times Poll, a dramatic turnaround 
from the Times' December survey, when she trailed him by 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
Darry Sragow, a top Feinstein adviser, said that the new poll has generated so 
many queries from volunteers and potential donors that the campaign will move 
from its cramped Santa Monica headquarters to a more spacious office in the 
Mid-Wilshire area. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, Dianne is like the Miata," said Sragow, referring to a new 
sports car that is so popular there are long waiting lists. "There is enormous 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Brown, daughter of former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown and sister of 
former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., will also be on the June Democratic ballot in 
a move to launch a statewide political career that is drawing interest from all 
over the country. 
</P>
<P>
Her opponent in November could be a woman if former U.S. Treasurer Angela (Bay) 
Buchanan pulls off an upset in June of incumbent Republican Treasurer Thomas 
Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Marian Bergeson of Newport Beach is also trying to increase the 
number of women in top political office by seeking the Republican nomination 
for lieutenant governor. Her major opponent on the June ballot will be state 
Sen. John Seymour of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Two-term incumbent Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy will have no serious opposition on 
the Democratic side. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the only woman holding statewide office in California is Secretary 
of State March Fong Eu. She has filed her candidacy for June and could have her 
first major female opponent for the job she has held since 1974 if Los Angeles 
City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores wins the GOP nomination for secretary of 
state in June. 
</P>
<P>
Flores is opposed by Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Gordon Levy. 
</P>
<P>
Reform advocate Tom Skornia and insurance agent Wes Banister will fight for the 
GOP nomination for insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. John Garamendi of Walnut Grove probably has the best name 
recognition of the Democratic candidates for the job. He ran a strong race for 
state controller in 1986, losing to Gray Davis, who will have no serious 
opposition for the controller's job this year. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi's top opponents for insurance commissioner are Conway Collis, a 
member of the State Board of Equalization, Walter Zelman, the former head of 
California Common Cause, television commentator Bill Press and activist-lawyer 
Ray Bourhis. 
</P>
<P>
A battle for attorney general is shaping up as San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo 
Smith takes on Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner in the Democratic primary. 
The winner will face former Long Beach Rep. Daniel Lungren, a Republican who 
helped revise the federal Criminal Code while in Congress.

Four Indian intelligence agents disappeared in Kashmir, and a news report said 
they were kidnaped by Muslim militants fighting for independence. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an Indian Cabinet minister who was dispatched to the war-torn region 
acknowledged that the government has held secret meetings with the separatists 
in a bid to open peace talks. United News of India, in a report from Jammu, 
said the missing agents, who provide security for senior government officials, 
were abducted from the Nawab Bazar area in downtown Srinagar. The governor of 
Jammu-Kashmir state said the men were on a regular patrol when the intelligence 
headquarters lost radio contact with them. Their burned jeep was found a 
half-hour later, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Charles H. Mayo II, the grandson of one of the founders of the Mayo Clinic, 
has been fined $4,000 by the Minnesota Board of Medical Examiners for not 
diagnosing illnesses in his patients. During his 16 years with Group Health, a 
health maintenance organization in the Twin Cities, Mayo failed to diagnosis 
lung cancer in one patient, leukemia in another, skin cancer in a third, and a 
broken forearm in a fourth, according to a document signed by Mayo and Dr. 
George B. Martin, chairman of the board's discipline committee. 
</P>
<P>
Mayo, who is practicing with the board's permission in a clinic in Moorhead, 
Minn., said he thought he was being unfairly singled out for review. "I feel 
put upon," he said. Mayo, 59, said he thought the fact that he carries a famous 
name in medicine was a factor in the review.

Tootsie the cat is back home after spending five weeks in a storm drain. 
</P>
<P>
"The poor little thing looked awful when we got her out. 
</P>
<P>
She was just skin and bones," said Nicole Lonsdale, who helped find the cat for 
her neighbors, Peter and Teri Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
Tootsie disappeared on Jan. 26, after apparently entering an open storm drain 
that was later sealed off by a snow plow clearing roads in this southern Maine 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The Tysons and neighbors searched the area but gave up hope of finding the 
6-year-old cat. 
</P>
<P>
Then, late last week, Tyson was chatting with Lonsdale in her driveway when he 
heard a faint meow from the nearby drain. He pried the lid off and climbed 
inside, calling Tootsie's name. The cat poked its head out of a pipe and 
scampered to Tyson.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ARTS GROUP OPENS SHOW OF SLAIN MURALIST'S 
WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent slaying of a 37-year-old Los Angeles artist has prompted a Venice 
arts organization to open a showing of his work in his honor, while two 
suspects in the killing await preliminary hearings in Los Angeles County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Hitoshi (Tony) Yshida, a Japanese-born muralist and set designer best known in 
Los Angeles for his acclaimed 1989 mural, "Flight to the Angels" in Little 
Tokyo, was stabbed with a kitchen knife March 1 in what police described as a 
"domestic" dispute at a Hollywood apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Two men who were visiting a roommate of Yshida's girlfriend were arrested March 
4 in the slaying, Detective Ron Venneman said. Zialcito De Castro, 30, pleaded 
not guilty to a charge of murder on Wednesday, and on Thursday, Carlos Pascual 
Jr., 37, pleaded not guilty to a charge of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Directors of the Social and Public Art Resource Center, which is showing 
Yshida's work, said he was known for his "futuristic symbolism."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLDEN CALLS PROBE OF BROOKINS 'A GIMMICK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
African Methodist Episcopal Church leaders and Councilman Nate Holden on Friday 
defended a controversial education and job training program that operates out 
of a building owned by Bishop H.H. Brookins. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a gimmick," Holden said of a city investigation that concluded 
Brookins had "obscured" from the city his ownership of a Southwest Los Angeles 
office complex that housed the program. 
</P>
<P>
The program was stripped of its $87,142-a-year city contract last month. The 
Community Development Department said Brookins had a conflict of interest as 
owner of the building and head of the program while he received rent from the 
city, and that he listed the building's owner as a nonexistent California 
church corporation before he acquired the property in his own name. 
</P>
<P>
But Rev. Larry Kirkland, a member of Southern California Conference AME Church, 
said the church owned the building until it was sold in 1984.

METHAMPHETAMINE SPREAD HIKES TOXIC CONTAMINATION RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When police raided a white, wooden house on Pasadena Avenue in Long Beach early 
this year, they found a dozen guns and rifles, one pit bull, a couple of boa 
constrictors, two small children and enough toxic chemicals to blow up the 
block. 
</P>
<P>
Unbeknown to the neighbors on the residential street, William Odom was in the 
business of manufacturing methamphetamines, otherwise known as speed. The pipes 
under the kitchen sink were rotted from corrosive chemicals poured down the 
drain. The walls and carpeting were saturated with poisonous fumes. By the time 
Odom moved into his new residence in state prison, the house on Pasadena Avenue 
was a miniature toxic wasteland, local police and prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Experts warn that methamphetamines, highly addictive stimulants long confined 
to outlaw motorcycle gangs, will replace crack cocaine as the drug of the '90s. 
Already, the 15 clandestine drug labs uncovered in the Long Beach this year is 
more than the two previous years combined. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike the cocaine that is processed beyond American borders, police said 
drug dealers are "cooking" methamphetamines right here -- in motel rooms, atop 
toilet seats, in storage sheds, garages, camper shells and rental houses -- 
using some of the most explosive and carcinogenic chemicals known to science. 
</P>
<P>
As its popularity soars across California, the drug not only threatens to 
ravage its addicts but also to poison the environment, contaminate police 
officers and imperil the public health, law enforcement and health officials 
warn. 
</P>
<P>
"These manufacturers are leaving toxic waste dumps behind them that you cannot 
smell or see," said Long Beach Deputy Dist. Atty. Barbara Channell, who has 
prosecuted 15 cases in a little more than a year, "the tip of the iceberg," in 
her assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine you're in Room 212 of the motel while he's in Room 211 and it all 
blows up," she said. "Why should people have to live in an environment like 
that with no means of knowing what's going on next door?" 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, police seized 184 drug labs nationwide. In 1989, they took 1,000, 
according to the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Forty-four percent of 
the labs were in California, more than any other single state, the DEA reports. 
</P>
<P>
Known in the streets as "crank," methamphetamines have long been considered the 
drug of poor white men -- injected, snorted, smoked and sold mostly by outlaw 
motorcycle gangs. 
</P>
<P>
But as diplomats and drug agents move to shut down the pipeline of cocaine from 
Colombia and other Latin countries, methamphetamines are moving in to take its 
place, experts warn. The price is said to be cheaper, the high is said to be 
longer and the source is local. 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, only 2% of the addicts who sought help at a city-run drug 
rehabilitation clinic were methamphetamine addicts. Today 20% are, the majority 
of them women, said Jane Reddick, a unit supervisor at the Pine Avenue 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, a new concentrated form of methamphetamines known as "ice" has already 
overtaken crack on the Hawaiian Islands, offering a high that is said to last 
up to 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Law enforcement is standing on the beach watching a tidal wave and it is going 
to hit soon," said Long Beach Police Sgt. Gerry Roberts, who investigates drug 
labs full-time. "Once they realize they can get more for their money with 
methamphetamines, there is nothing doctors, parents, husbands, wives, sisters 
or brothers can do to stop them. We will be off to the races." 
</P>
<P>
The recipe for methamphetamines includes an array of chemicals known to cause 
cancer, birth defects and blindness. One of the byproducts of the cooking 
process is phosphine gas, similar to mustard gas used during World War I. 
</P>
<P>
Police say it is cooked by "chemists" usually high on the drug themselves. 
Their crude laboratories are stocked with crock pots, turkey basters and Pyrex 
pie plates. Police find them in the same motel rooms businessmen frequent -- 
the smoke alarms disconnected and the toxic waste poured down the drain -- and 
in rental homes, the poisonous run-off dumped into back yard soil. 
</P>
<P>
"Are there children playing in the soil? Is it getting into the drinking water? 
Are there vapors under the house?" asked Dick Smith, chief of the Long Beach 
Department of Health and Human Services hazardous materials unit. 
</P>
<P>
"Cops treat this stuff like something that could blow up the block. You start 
thinking, 'What did I breath? Did it stick to my clothes?' " Roberts said. "I 
went through two pairs of Levis, two pairs of shoes and two shirts on two 
cases. I just took them off outside my house and threw them away."

2 WOMEN FOUND SHOT TO DEATH IN LAWNDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two young women were found slain in a sedan parked near Leuzinger High School 
in Lawndale, and sheriff's deputies said Friday they were searching for a 
30-year-old Carson man as a suspect in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
Isabel Ines, 22, of Bell Gardens, and Maria Hernandez, 21, of Torrance, were 
found about 9:30 p.m. Thursday, shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
The car was parked at the end of a cul-de-sac in the 14500 block of Freeman 
Avenue, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said they saw a red truck driving away shortly before the bodies were 
found and deputies said they were seeking Hesiquio Fraire Cerda, believed to be 
the driver of the truck. 
</P>
<P>
Officers declined comment on a possible motive in the shootings, but they said 
the deaths apparently were not related to student demonstrations at the high 
school earlier this week protesting alleged racism by school officials. 
Deputies from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department station in Lennox 
said they discovered the bodies after they were called to the scene by a 
neighbor who reported a "suspicious" sedan parked at curbside. 
</P>
<P>
The witnesses noted the license plate of the red, 1990 GMC sports truck that 
drove away, and Cerda was identified through an investigation that began with a 
search of vehicle registration records, deputies said. The officers said they 
are also looking for the truck, license number 2PYR964. 
</P>
<P>
None of the witnesses reported hearing any shots, leading to speculation that 
the women were shot elsewhere, then driven to where they were found. Liz 
Rivera, who lives across the street from where the women were found, said the 
sedan did not appear on the street until shortly before the bodies were found 
in it.

2 WOMEN GET PRISON FOR KILLING CLASSMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two young Arleta women were sentenced to a minimum of 15 years in state prison 
Friday for the drowning of a 17-year-old high school classmate they had accused 
of having an affair with their boyfriends. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Severson and Laura Doyle, both 22, stared straight ahead, showing no 
emotion, as Pasadena Superior Court Judge Jack B. Tso sentenced them to the 
maximum penalty for second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
A jury found the women guilty Jan. 31 of murdering Michele (Missy) Avila, who 
was drowned Oct. 1, 1985, in a shallow stream in the remote Big Tujunga Canyon 
area of Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
With credit for the time they have already served in Los Angeles County Jail, 
the women will be eligible for parole in about seven years. Attorneys for the 
women said they will appeal the case. 
</P>
<P>
Avila's body was found by hikers two days after she died. But Severson and 
Doyle, who were teen-agers at the time of the killing, were not arrested until 
almost three years later when Eva Chirumbolo, a witness to the slaying, finally 
came forward. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Avila's death, Severson moved in with the Avila family to console 
them, even joining them for Thanksgiving dinner that year. At that time, Irene 
Avila, the victim's mother, said Severson was her daughter's best friend and 
like a second daughter to her. 
</P>
<P>
Tso said the maximum sentence was warranted because of the violent nature of 
the crime. During the two-week trial, several witnesses testified that the 
women quarreled with Avila and angrily accused her of having sex with their 
boyfriends. Chirumbolo testified that the two held their struggling friend's 
face down in six inches of water until she died. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses also testified that both women were jealous of Avila because of her 
petite stature, good looks and popularity with boys. 
</P>
<P>
Before the sentence was announced, members of the Avila family urged the judge 
to give Michele Avila's killers the maximum penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"My life has been shattered forever because of this cold-blooded and senseless 
act," said Irene Avila. "They left my daughter to die in the woods like an 
animal." 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God, justice has been served," she said afterward, clutching a framed 
photograph of her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's brother, Mark Avila, 24, said Severson and Doyle not only killed 
his sister but "a part of all our lives as well." 
</P>
<P>
Doyle's attorney, Charles Lloyd, and Harold S. Vites, the attorney who defended 
Severson, called for leniency because of the women's age and because they said 
their childhoods had been troubled. 
</P>
<P>
Vites said Severson "at some point" wants to rebuild her life. "For the rest of 
her days, she will live with the memory of this crime," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Tamia Hope said people "are still waiting for Laura 
Doyle and Karen Severson to show some remorse. When are they going to face the 
seriousness of this crime?" 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Campbell, 43, of South Pasadena was foreman of the jury that convicted 
Doyle and Severson, and he returned to the courtroom for the sentencing. "I 
just had to see this through," he said. "I now think justice has been served."

A COMMITMENT TO HELPING OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several months ago, Kevin Alex got a telephone call from a sobbing classmate. 
Increasingly frustrated with learning difficulties and sure that everyone in 
her family was "better," the girl had just left school and was thinking of 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Alex kept her on the phone, urging her to get help, assuring her over and over 
that she is a good and worthy person. "There is a place on this Earth for you . 
. . it's a beautiful world, and nothing is worth killing yourself over," he 
told the girl, who today is back in school and working out her problems. 
</P>
<P>
For Alex, 18, a bright, energetic Fairfax High School senior who has worked 
hard to overcome a learning disability, the advice reflected his own philosophy 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
Keenly interested in politics and human relations, Alex wants to be a priest 
and help others. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, he attended the Brotherhood/Sisterhood U.S.A. camp sponsored by 
the Los Angeles Unified School District and the National Conference of 
Christians and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things I love about L.A. is all the different groups. I like to 
learn about different cultures, languages, religions. I think it's very 
important that we all learn to understand each other," said Alex, who plans to 
attend another, school-sponsored program on race relations this month. 
</P>
<P>
Right after that, he will spend a week in Washington as part of the school's 
and the Close-Up Foundation's program to familiarize students with the workings 
of the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he will appear on a Washington-based cable television show about 
youths involved in community work, and end the month with a church retreat. 
</P>
<P>
The fast pace is something Alex is used to. 
</P>
<P>
After school is out each day, he rides the bus downtown to City Hall, where he 
works in the mayor's Office for the Disabled from 3 until at least 5 p.m. He 
studies on the bus as well as every evening at home to keep up with his 
schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
On Sundays, he sings in the choir at St. Columbkille Church in South-Central 
Los Angeles, and then serves as an altar boy at St. Vincent de Paul Church in 
the West Adams district. 
</P>
<P>
During Christmas vacation he worked at Universal Studios to help raise money 
for the trip to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I am just amazed at the drive and determination Kevin has -- I wish some of 
the other kids had even just half as much," said Zane Meckler, community 
liaison representative at Fairfax High. "But what is even more outstanding is 
his caring and commitment to others," Meckler added. "This is a kid with such 
enthusiasm for life and such concern for others . . . he really wants to make a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Alex credits his family -- especially his mother, father, grandmother and aunt 
-- for instilling in him a need for persisting in the face of adversity and for 
caring about others. 
</P>
<P>
"They taught me that you have to work for what you want," Alex said. "They also 
taught me not to dislike anybody because of race or religion but to accept them 
for who they are." 
</P>
<P>
At City Hall, Alex has plastered the shelves above his desk with pictures of 
his family and of himself with Mayor Tom Bradley, one of his heroes, "because 
he shows he cares about all the different groups of people in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Betty Wilson, director of the Office for the Disabled, praised Alex as 
"committed, reliable and responsible." 
</P>
<P>
"In the two years he's been here, we have watched him grow from someone who was 
not always sure of himself to someone with a lot of confidence and who knows 
what he wants out of life," Wilson said.

WATER DILEMMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Water is something most Southern Californians take for granted -- until it is 
taken away, as it has been in Santa Barbara ("Drought Law Bans Watering Grass," 
March 1). 
</P>
<P>
The reality is: California is in its fourth consecutive drought-condition year. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara's strict water enforcement rules are indicative of the type of 
measure that all of Southern California will need to adopt in a severe water 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
We can still enjoy our green lawns, plants and flowers if we embrace simple 
conservation efforts (taking shorter showers, alternating days for outdoor 
irrigation, running full loads of laundry and dishes). Water re-use 
(reclamation) is a viable alternative to using valuable drinking water for our 
golf courses, parks and freeway medians.

ABORTION PILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a native California woman, I was proud to learn that physicians of my state 
who met in Anaheim took a progressive stand on the abortion issue (State 
Medical Group Urges Tests of French Abortion Pill, March 6). 
</P>
<P>
I realize the manufacturer of this product has been harassed, much as women 
exercising their legal right to surgical abortions have been, but I hope the 
pharmaceutical company will show the courage these women have shown and begin 
procedures to market RU-486 in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Availability of this product, that women can use in privacy, will help to take 
abortion out of the public and political arenas.

GATHERS HAD INSURANCE POLICY; 
</P>
<P>
AFTERMATH: LOYOLA MARYMOUNT STAR MIGHT HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE TO COLLECT $1 
MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANNY ROBBINS and MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hank Gathers may have been eligible to collect on a $1-million insurance policy 
in December, when he was diagnosed as having an irregular heartbeat, if he had 
quit playing basketball at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, the Loyola Marymount star who collapsed and died Sunday during a West 
Coast Conference tournament game, purchased a $1-million policy from Lloyd's of 
London last May to guard against career-ending injury or illness during his 
senior season at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
The policy, which ran until May of this year, can no longer be cashed because 
it does not contain a provision for death. But, had Gathers quit basketball 
when his heart condition was first noted, he might have been able to collect on 
the policy, according to sources familiar with the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't yet know exactly what Hank's condition was," said Mike Petersen, vice 
president of Petersen Marketing and Management Corp., the L.A. correspondent 
for Lloyd's of London who handled Gathers' policy. "But this is a good example 
of a situation where a policy might have paid off. If the doctors state that he 
can never play basketball again because of his condition, that would qualify 
(for a payoff) under the definition of the policy." 
</P>
<P>
As it is, Lloyd's of London has agreed to return the $6,600 premium that 
Gathers paid to obtain the policy, according to Petersen -- a move that 
industry sources believe may be unprecedented for the company. Lloyd's 
underwrites most of the disability insurance policies purchased by athletes. 
</P>
<P>
It is common for high-profile football and basketball players who anticipate 
having professional careers to protect themselves by purchasing disability 
insurance while still in college. For instance, Louisiana State basketball star 
Chris Jackson, a sophomore, said earlier this season that he had purchased a 
$1-million policy from Lloyd's of London. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Blake, the NBA's director of scouting, has said that Gathers, a 6-foot-7 
center who was projected as a forward in the NBA, most likely would have been a 
middle to late first-round pick in this year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
According to Petersen, Gathers' policy covered him for any kind of 
career-ending disability, on or off the court, which is standard practice for 
such policies. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers momentarily lost consciousness during Loyola's Dec. 9 game against UC 
Santa Barbara. After undergoing a battery of tests, he was diagnosed as having 
a cardiac arrhythmia, a condition in which the heart beats irregularly. He was 
put on medication, Inderal, that is often prescribed in such cases. He returned 
to the Lions' lineup Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Among the questions raised by Gathers' death is whether or not he should have 
been allowed to continue playing. School officials have cited a letter, dated 
Dec. 21, 1989 and signed by Dr. Michael Mellman, a Los Angeles internist, that 
cleared Gathers to return to competition. However, a cardiologist familiar with 
the case has told The Times that Gathers was advised not to play after his 
initial fainting episode. 
</P>
<P>
Had Gathers followed such advice, he would have, according to Petersen and 
others, stood a good chance of cashing in on his policy. 
</P>
<P>
"He would have had a decent claim, as far as I can tell, because he had no 
history of anything (medical problems)," said Dana Morck, the insurance broker 
who sold Gathers the policy. "The only thing he was concerned about, I think, 
was a twisted ankle he had toward the end of last season." 
</P>
<P>
According to Morck, president of Morck Financial and Insurance Services in 
Torrance, Gathers showed no signs of heart or other medical problems when he 
underwent a physical that was required to obtain the policy. Morck said the 
physical was given by a Loyola team physician whose name he could not recall. 
</P>
<P>
Morck said he did not sell Gathers a life insurance policy and does not believe 
the player took one out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a concern with him," Morck said. "Unfortunately, a 22-year-old male 
in great physical shape -- at least when he took out the (disability insurance) 
policy -- doesn't consider himself mortal. He's worried about blowing out a 
knee." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers came up with the $6,600 he needed to purchase the disability insurance 
by obtaining a bank loan, Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
Under NCAA rules, a college athlete can obtain disability insurance by 
borrowing against his future earnings from an accredited commercial lending 
institution as long as neither a school representative nor a sports agent is 
involved in the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
With Gathers' death, Petersen said, Lloyd's of London has agreed to refund the 
entire premium, although the company is under no obligation to do so. "The 
tremendous shock and sympathy factor caused them (Lloyd's of London) to 
consider this case as a flat cancellation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd's of London refunded only a portion of the premium used to purchase a 
similar policy for the late Len Bias, the University of Maryland basketball 
player who died of cocaine intoxication shortly after being drafted by the 
Boston Celtics in 1986, according to William Sutton, whose Toronto firm set up 
Bias' policy. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dennis Burns, executive vice president of an Arlington Heights, Ill., firm 
that also arranges policies for athletes with Lloyd's of London: "That thing 
(Gathers' policy) runs almost a year. The majority of the premium burns out 
during the playing season. . . . If Hank had called up at some point and said, 
'I want to cancel,' they (Lloyd's of London) would have kept it (the premium). 
But, because of the way things happened, they're not keeping anything." 
</P>
<P>
David Spencer, who as a USC assistant coach recruited Gathers to that school in 
1985, said he urged Gathers to purchase the insurance policy when the player 
was considering making himself eligible for the NBA draft last spring.

GATHERS' FAMILY PLANS TO FILE SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUIT: ATTORNEY CLAIMS A LOYOLA OFFICIAL REQUESTED REDUCTION IN PLAYER'S 
MEDICATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND and DANNY ROBBINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the day that Dobbins Tech High School in Philadelphia held a memorial 
service for Hank Gathers, an attorney for Gathers' family announced Friday he 
plans to file a lawsuit in L.A. Superior Court against those he believes are 
responsible for the former basketball star's death. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, 23, collapsed last Sunday during a West Coast Conference tournament 
game in Gersten Pavilion. The Loyola Marymount star died 1 hour 40 minutes 
later at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most serious claims made by Bruce Fagel, a Beverly Hills attorney who 
was previously a physician specializing in emergency medicine, was that someone 
in the Loyola athletic department requested a reduction in Gathers' medication. 
Fagel said that request, obtained in medical records, came "because it was 
affecting his play." 
</P>
<P>
Fagel said his staff is trying to determine who was involved in allowing 
Gathers to play and whether proper medical standards were followed after 
Gathers collapsed at midcourt. After that, the defendants will be named, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the university wanted Mr. Gathers to play and they were involved," 
Fagel said. "I'm not sure if it was the coach or trainer. It is obvious at this 
time the university is as much or more involved than the physicians in the 
circumstances that led to Gathers' death. I want to find out who at the 
university intervened in making decisions pertaining to medication dosages as 
well as the decision to play." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the university Friday night, Martin Burke, Loyola's 
legal counsel, said the university was cooperating with Fagel's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Loyola Marymount University has made available to Bruce Fagel . . . medical 
records from the university health center," he said in the statement. "It is 
our understanding that the physicians have cooperated with Mr. Fagel, and it is 
the intent of the university to fully cooperate in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"The threat of a lawsuit requires, however, that we consult with our insurance 
carriers and their legal counsel. We will do this on Monday. The university is 
convinced that Hank Gathers had outstanding physicians and that the 
administration acted responsibly. He was only allowed to resume his athletic 
activities following written release by his physicians." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Quinn, Loyola Marymount's athletic director, said he had been advised by 
Burke not to comment on the allegations made by Fagel. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn acknowledged, however, that he was bothered by the fact that Fagel held 
the news conference to make the charges before Gathers' funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say to you and anyone else that there was a beautiful marriage between 
Hank and our university," he said Friday night. "I hate to see anything at this 
point take away from the man, the grieving and hurt on our campus, the grieving 
of his family. I'm going to the funeral to pay my last respects. After that, I 
will have to sit down and figure out what's going on and why. At this stage, I 
believe we did everything right and followed the best medical advice. I don't 
know what else I can say." 
</P>
<P>
Although Gathers' funeral is not scheduled until Monday in Philadelphia, Fagel 
said he was compelled to announce the $1-million-plus suit after Loyola 
president James N. Loughran said he was satisfied with the school's handling of 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Loughran told The Times on Thursday that a doctor's letter allowing Gathers to 
play relieved the university of any responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
The suit could encompass personal physicians, attending physicians and the 
school. Fagel said the case will involve allegations of medical malpractice and 
infliction of emotional distress on family members who witnessed the incident 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
California state law limits damage to $250,000 for malpractice claims of pain 
and suffering against doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers fainted Dec. 9 during a game against UC Santa Barbara, and underwent a 
number of tests that revealed he suffered from a heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
He was prescribed the drug Inderal, a beta-blocker that can helps control 
abnormal heart rhythms. Fagel said medical records show that Gathers reduced 
his medication three times -- from 240 milligrams to 40 milligrams -- at the 
recommendation of Dr. Vernon T. Hattori, a cardiologist affiliated with Daniel 
Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
Fagel also said family members and friends told him that Gathers took his 
medication Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Side effects of Inderal, according to the Physicians' Desk Reference, include 
weakness, fatigue and lethargy with dosages of at least 160 milligrams per day. 
</P>
<P>
Fagel said Gathers' medical records were made available by the doctors who 
treated the player -- Hattori and Dr. Michael Mellman. While Fagel has received 
some records from the university, he said school officials refused to release 
other records on Gathers such as the doctor's clearance to allow Gathers to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Los Angeles County Coroner's office said preliminary tests show 
Gathers' heart problem caused his death. The coroner's report is expected to be 
released Wednesday or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also is expected to question the procedures of Gathers' immediate care 
Sunday. Loyola officials had purchased a defibrillator on Hattori's advice when 
Gathers returned to the Lions' lineup Dec. 30. It was taken on the road when 
Loyola played in Philadelphia against LaSalle and St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
The instrument, which can shock a failing heart back to a normal rhythm, was 
not used after Gathers collapsed. Dr. Benjamin Schaeffer, an orthopedist from 
the Kerlan-Jobe Clinic, and Dr. Daniel Hyslop, from Loyola's Student Health 
Services, attended him.

ABBOTT UNHAPPY ABOUT RAISE; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS: CLUB RENEWS HIS CONTRACT. HE WILL RECEIVE $185,000 THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Abbott, the first Angel rookie pitcher to reach double figures in victories 
in four years, said Friday that the team's decision to unilaterally renew his 
contract and pay him $185,000 this season "kind of hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott earned the minimum of $68,000 last season and as a second-year player is 
not Abbott, who made a rare jump by going directly from college ball to the 
major leagues, was 12-12 with a 3.92 earned-run average in 181 1/3 innings. He 
was the first Angel rookie left-hander to reach double figures since Frank 
Tanana in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't ask for the moon," Abbott said. "I'm not real happy with it. We went 
in and we talked about how I contributed a lot to the Angels on and off the 
field and they didn't agree. We really went in with an offer we felt was fair 
based on my performance. You look at guys around the league who have won less 
games, and they're going to be paid $80,000 to $100,000 more. 
</P>
<P>
"We just feel there was a pretty good commitment on our part toward the Angel 
organization and they said there wasn't. I'm a little disappointed. In these 
things, you should compare yourself with people in your class and they ranked 
me at the bottom of the class." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels also renewed the contract of pitcher Mike Fetters, who was 12-8 last 
season with triple-A Edmonton. Seven players also agreed to new contracts, 
catchers John Orton and Ron Tingley, infielders Mark McLemore, Kent Anderson 
and Bobby Rose, outfielder Dante Bichette and pitcher Rich Monteleone. 
</P>
<P>
No terms were disclosed in any case. The Angels have all 38 of their players 
under contract. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott's agent, Scott Boros, said that in arguing for a higher salary he 
compared Abbott with to the Atlanta Braves' John Smoltz, the Seattle Mariners' 
Brian Holman and the Baltimore Orioles' Bob Milacki, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Smoltz, who was 12-11 with a 2.94 ERA in 208 innings, recently signed for 
$210,000 plus $55,000 in incentives. Milacki was 14-12 with a 3.74 ERA in 243 
innings, and he recently signed for $235,000 plus $40,000 in incentives. 
Abbott's contract has no incentive clauses. Holman was 8-10 with a 3.44 ERA and 
signed for $195,000. 
</P>
<P>
Boros also contended that Abbott should be compensated for attracting fans to 
Anaheim Stadium. He presented the Angels with data showing that the team's 
average attendance in Abbott's home starts was 5,000 higher than in games 
started by other pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Mr. (Gene) Autry would particularly understand Jim Abbott's 
entertainment value," Boros said. "(The attendance increase) was pretty 
reflective that his value was above average for a major league baseball player 
but the Angels said they do not recognize that value." 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Mike Port said the raise given Abbott was substantial and 
deserved. 
</P>
<P>
"We evaluated his performance to the best of the club's capacity and tired to 
look at it in an economic framework," Port said. "We've had the capability of 
renewing since March 1, but we wanted to give our fellows every conceivable 
opportunity to present their case."

NFL TV PACKAGE HITS $3.637 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The NFL's new four-year television contract was all but completed Friday when 
NBC agreed to pay $752 million for the AFC games plus the 1993 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
All that remains are the rights to the 1994 Super Bowl, which will not be 
awarded until later -- within a year. 
</P>
<P>
The NBC deal raised the total revenue from all three networks and cable to 
$3.637 billion. Add another $40 million, which the '94 Super Bowl is expected 
to bring, and the total is $3.677 billion. 
</P>
<P>
That breaks down to $32.8 million a team a year, or nearly double the $17 
million each club was making under the old contract, which was worth $1.428 
billion over three years. 
</P>
<P>
Turner Broadcasting, which made its deal two weeks ago, will pay $450 million 
for Sunday night football during the first half of the next four seasons. ESPN 
will pay another $450 million for Sunday night football during the second half 
of the same seasons. 
</P>
<P>
ABC will pay $925 million for Monday night football, two Saturday first-round 
playoff games under an expanded format and the 1991 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
CBS will pay $1.06 billion for the NFC package plus the 1992 Super Bowl. CBS is 
also paying $1.06 billion for baseball over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' football tab is higher than NBC's because the NFC has most of the larger 
markets and, thus, generates higher ratings. Although New York and Los Angeles 
have teams in both conferences, the NFC also has Chicago, San Francisco, 
Dallas, Detroit and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
One way the NFL increased its total value to television was to boost the number 
of playoff teams from 10 to 12, thus creating two additional playoff games for 
ABC to televise. 
</P>
<P>
Another was to extend the season. There will be 16 games over 17 weeks the next 
two seasons, then 16 over 18 weeks after that. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL also brought in a new cable partner, Turner, creating a new package. 
</P>
<P>
The new television contract will be ratified at the owners' meeting next week 
in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Departing from previous practice, the NFL announced each deal separately this 
time. In the past, the league waited until all negotiations were completed 
before making one announcement. 
</P>
<P>
The new total package is viewed both in league and network circles as a triumph 
for Paul Tagliabue, the new commissioner, who negotiated it along with Art 
Modell, the owner of the Cleveland Browns and chairman of the television 
committee, and Val Pinchbeck, the league's director of broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rozelle, former commissioner, also is credited with an assist for limiting 
the 1987 contract, negotiated in a time of network retrenchment, to three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"The magnitude of this new agreement reflects the NFL's importance to NBC," 
network Vice President Arthur Watson said. "Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, Art 
Modell and Val Pinchbeck should be congratulated." 
</P>
<P>
Another network official, who asked not to be identified, put it more bluntly: 
"They certainly didn't leave any money on the table."

RAMS SIGN PLAN B GUARD MILINICHIK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams announced the signing of six free agents Friday, including Plan B 
guard Joe Milinichik of the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Milinichik, 6-feet-5, 275 pounds, played in all 16 games for Detroit last 
season, starting once. 
</P>
<P>
He was a four-year starter at North Carolina State and the Lions' third-round 
draft choice in 1986. Milinichik, who will turn 27 March 30, spent his entire 
rookie season on injured reserve after suffering a dislocated elbow. 
</P>
<P>
After being injured during training camp in 1989, Milinichik lost his starting 
job to rookie Mike Utley. 
</P>
<P>
With the Rams, Milinichik fills a void left by guard/center Tony Slaton, a Plan 
B free agent who signed last week with Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
In lesser moves, the team signed tight end Richard Ashe and wide receiver 
Anthony Sargent, both of whom finished the 1989 season on the team's 
developmental squad. 
</P>
<P>
Others signed included guard Jeff Mickel, Eastern Washington; cornerback Mario 
Mitchell, San Diego State, and wide receiver Derrick Saison, Howard University.

PROST, SENNA CAN SMILE AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
FORMULA ONE: FORMER TEAMMATES PART, WITH PROST GOING TO FERRARI FOR SUNDAY'S 
SEASON-OPENING RACE AT PHOENIX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alain Prost won his third Formula One world championship last year for McLaren, 
but there were no smiles from the little Frenchman. 
</P>
<P>
Ayrton Senna, who finished second, rarely smiles for any reason. Last year, he 
had reason not to smile after being disqualified, fined, suspended and 
threatened with expulsion at the Japanese Grand Prix for a transgression that 
contributed to his losing the world championship he had won in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But that was last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Professor, as Prost is known along the Grand Prix circuit, is smiling 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Senna, a Brazilian who thinks of little else but winning races, is even smiling 
-- a bit. 
</P>
<P>
The start of a new season will do that. No one has lost, crashed, blown an 
engine or been fined yet. All is well in Formula One until Sunday, when the 
second Iceberg USA Grand Prix will be run through the streets of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
More significant for Prost and Senna is that they are no longer teammates 
driving the same Honda-powered, British-built McLarens that have dominated 
Formula One for the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Prost has gone to Ferrari to drive the distinctive red cars with Britain's 
Nigel Mansell, leaving Senna at McLaren with former Ferrari driver Gerhard 
Berger of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning their former teammates by name, Prost and Senna made it 
clear this week that they are much happier with the new alignment. 
</P>
<P>
"My motivation, my anticipation of being with a new team, has never been 
greater, but more than that, racing is fun again," Prost said. "Nigel and I 
have been friends for a long time, and we think the same way about motor 
racing. We can work together with the cars, and then we can golf together for 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
Prost was admittedly upset with Senna's intensity, which frequently found him 
in the garage checking with his mechanics long after everyone else had left. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a computer. He sees only his success," Prost said last year. 
</P>
<P>
Prost is not the first driver to criticize Senna's devotion to racing. 
</P>
<P>
Prost was also nettled by what he considered favoritism toward Senna from the 
McLaren team. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I cannot understand is the way Ron Dennis behaved with Senna," Prost 
was quoted as saying in the French sports daily, L'Equipe. "He forgives him 
everything. And he gives him whatever he wants. For instance, when I was ready 
to test, if Senna wanted the car, they asked me to give it to him." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he faced 1990 with less strife than last year, Senna smiled as he 
answered: "I hope so. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, yes, definitely I do. And that I am sure brings up the next question, 
why? My feelings are that respect comes from results, and it is reciprocal, and 
I think Gerhard (Berger) and I have that respect. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we maintain that respect for each other and honesty with each 
other, we will have the right relationship. And that relationship can have a 
great influence in the motivation we have." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Prost won the championship last year, Senna was the hottest driver. 
He won six races to four for Prost and took the pole in 13 of the 16 races, 
including the last six. Senna was on the pole in Phoenix last year with a speed 
of 94.287 m.p.h., but speeds should be much faster this year because of cooler 
weather. Last year, the race was in June, and the temperature was 100-plus 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Senna and Dennis, the McLaren team director, are still smarting over the ruling 
in Japan last October by the International Motor Sports Federation (FISA) and 
resultant rulings by Jean-Marie Balestre, FISA chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Senna needed victories in Japan and the season's final race, in Australia, to 
retain his world championship against Prost, who already had announced that he 
was leaving McLaren for Ferrari at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Prost was leading with seven laps remaining when Senna attempted to pass, and 
their cars collided. Both spun off course. Prost was unable to restart, but 
Senna got his car going and returned to the race, finishing first. 
</P>
<P>
Race officials ruled, however, that Senna had shortened the course by cutting 
off one turn when he restarted, and he was disqualified. This clinched the 
championship for Prost, and when Senna was fined $100,000 and given a six-month 
suspension, it set off a series of protests and appeals by McLaren and Senna. 
</P>
<P>
Senna accused Balestre of rigging the title for his fellow Frenchman. Balestre 
responded by threatening to ban Senna for the entire season if he did not 
apologize. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have not given up on last year," Senna said. "It is a very complex 
situation, (with) two sides to it, and after much discussion, (FISA) came to a 
conclusion, and it was not the right conclusion at all. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not right for me, the crew, the sponsors, the team, the sport, the 
nation. It was not good." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis said a decision was still pending as to whether McLaren would pursue the 
case in a French civil court. 
</P>
<P>
"We will do what we think is in the best interest of the sport," Dennis said. 
"At the moment, I can't give you the answer. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, our focus is on winning the 1990 world championship." 
</P>
<P>
Prost was not McLaren's only loss to Ferrari. Also defecting was engineer Steve 
Nichols, but Dennis downplayed the significance of the move. 
</P>
<P>
"A team is only as strong as its weakest link," he said. "Steve was a very 
competent engineer, and he was successfully head-hunted (by Ferrari), but I 
doubt if his loss will have any effect on our program." 
</P>
<P>
Mansell, however, said Prost and Nichols will bring a lot of McLaren experience 
to the Ferrari team. 
</P>
<P>
"Having Alain on our team gives everyone at Ferrari tremendous motivation for 
the coming year, and the coming race, in particular," Mansell said. "Last year, 
we made tremendous strides with the new engine and the automatic gearbox. Now, 
with Alain's and Nichols' know-how, we should have better reliability." 
</P>
<P>
Mansell won the opening race last year in Brazil, but then was dogged by a 
string of reliability problems that caused him to drop out of five consecutive 
races. He came back to win in Hungary, and Berger gave Ferrari its third 1989 
victory in Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say we have a real crack at the world championship -- as long as we 
can chip it in on the last lap the way Greg Norman did on the last hole at 
Doral," Mansell said. 
</P>
<P>
Mansell, a one-handicap golfer who, critics say, spends more time on the golf 
course than in his race car, was at Doral on his way here for Sunday's race 
when he saw Norman chip in for an eagle to win a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Prost, who won world championships in 1985 and '86 with McLarens powered by 
turbocharged TAG Porsche engines and last year with a non-turbocharged Honda, 
is approaching the season with unbridled enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
"McLaren is in my past," he said. "I feel like the first day of school. Ferrari 
gives me new motivation, and, after 10 years in Formula One, it is fantastic 
for me to be driving for Ferrari." 
</P>
<P>
If Prost can repeat as champion, he would be second only to Juan Manuel Fangio 
of Argentina, who won five world titles between 1951 and '57. With three 
championships, Prost is tied with Piquet, Niki Lauda of Austria, Jack Brabham 
of Australia and Jackie Stewart of Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
With only a bit more luck, Prost already could be tied with Fangio. Or even 
ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, he lost to Nelson Piquet by one point while driving for Renault and 
commented after the season: "I can never be any closer and finish second." 
</P>
<P>
He was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The following season, he lost the championship by a half-point to his teammate, 
Lauda, in the first of six years with McLaren. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1988, when he lost to Senna, he scored more points, 105 to 94, but 
Formula One rules allowed a driver to count only his 11 top finishes from the 
16 races. Under that restriction, Senna won, 90-87. 
</P>
<P>
Prost is also the career leader with 39 victories in 10 seasons, far ahead of 
runner-up Stewart, who has 27. Senna has 20 in six seasons.

ONE TICKET WITH 8 WINNERS PAYS $494,252 IN PICK NINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A single Pick Nine ticket at Santa Anita Friday had eight of the day's nine 
winning horses on it, and that ticket was worth $494,252.40. 
</P>
<P>
There was a mandatory payout in the Pick Nine, after the carryover pool reached 
$525,915 at the end of Thursday's program. 
</P>
<P>
Under Pick Nine rules, the payout is made on the day after the carryover 
exceeds $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's crowd of 27,972, including 20,260 at the track, wagered another 
$538,240 for a chance at a big payoff. A single ticket with all nine winning 
horses would have been worth nearly $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
With no perfect tickets, there was a three-tiered payoff. In addition to the 
single winner with eight correct picks, 36 tickets with seven were worth 
$2,941.80 each, and 563 with six returned $188 apiece.

Kent Donnelly led Foothill High School to a 15-2 victory over Tustin in a 
championship semifinal of the Newport-Tustin baseball tournament Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Donnelly hit a two-run home run in the third inning to give Foothill a 3-2 
lead. Donnelly also pitched five innings and struck out seven. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill will play Mater Dei in the final at 2 p.m. today at Tustin High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
In the other championship semifinal, Lionel Hastings had two hits and three 
RBIs to lead Mater Dei to a 4-1 victory. Hastings' bases-loaded single in the 
fourth scored two runs. 
</P>

SOUTHLAND RACERS FARE WELL AT DISABLED EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
American racers dominated the World Disabled Ski Championships, which ended 
this week at Winter Park, Colo., taking a total of 83 medals, more than twice 
the number earned by runner-up West Germany, which had 37. 
</P>
<P>
Southland competitors contributed substantially to the U.S. team's success -- 
which included 35 gold medals to West Germany's 16 -- in several divisions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Greg Evangelatos, 28, of Sherman Oaks, who is blind, earned a gold medal in 
the super-G and a bronze in the giant slalom, a performance that also netted 
him a gold in the combined. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dave Kiley, 36, of LaVerne, a paraplegic athlete who races on a monoski, 
came away with golds in the super-G and the slalom and a silver in the giant 
slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Greg Mannino, 27, of Yorba Linda, who had one leg amputated above the knee, 
got a couple of bronzes, in the super-G and the downhill, as West German 
Alexander Spitz swept all four events in this category -- as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cathy Gentile, 27, of Torrance, also an above-the-knee amputee, won the 
gold medal in the downhill when favored Diana Golden fell, then wound up with 
the combined gold by placing second in the super-G and the slalom and sixth in 
the giant slalom -- as Golden won all three. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the medalists in the world championships, which First Interstate Bank 
brought to the United States for the first time, are en route east for the 
weeklong Chap Stick U.S. Disabled Ski Championships, which begin Sunday at 
Stratton Mountain, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
Evangelatos, who swept the gold medals in his division at last year's 
nationals, will not be able to defend his titles, however. He broke his 
collarbone in a finish-line collision with his guide after winning the super-G 
at Winter Park and needs about three months' healing time before resuming 
training for next season on Mt. Hood in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors permitted him to race in the giant slalom Tuesday, with one arm taped 
to his side, but only on the condition that he then take some time off. 
</P>
<P>
"And I got the bronze," Evangelatos said from Denver. "Not bad for a one-armed 
skier." 
</P>
<P>
Evangelatos, who lost his sight in a fireworks accident when he was 18, trains 
in Colorado during the winter and attends L.A. City College in the off-season. 
He is a volunteer worker with the Foundation for the Junior Blind's summer camp 
program in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to be a role model for totally blind children, helping them to realize 
their recreational capabilities and to understand that they can make their 
dreams come true," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kiley also works with the disabled, heading the wheelchair sports program at 
the Casa Colina rehabilitation center in Pomona. He is proficient in several 
sports and has only recently added skiing to his activities. 
</P>
<P>
After winning a World Cup slalom Thursday at Geilo, Norway, Alberto Tomba told 
the Associated Press: "It's Mother's Day in Italy today, so I dedicate this 
victory to my mother and all women in Italy." 
</P>
<P>
Tomba, 23, who has apparently regained the form that earned him two gold medals 
in the 1988 Winter Olympics at Calgary, and the other male racers are scheduled 
to compete in a super-G today at Hemsedal, Norway, and in a slalom Monday at 
Salen, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, Tiger Shaw of Stowe, Vt., finished seventh at Geilo, two places 
ahead of Switzerland's Pirmin Zurbriggen, who last weekend clinched his fourth 
World Cup overall title -- equaling the record of Italian Gustavo Thoeni. 
</P>
<P>
The women in the "White Circus" will race in a giant slalom today and a slalom 
Sunday at Stranda, Norway, where a heavy snowfall forced postponement of 
Friday's scheduled downhill. 
</P>
<P>
After a slalom Tuesday at Vemdalen, Sweden, and a giant slalom Wednesday at 
Klovsjo, Sweden, the women will join the men for the World Cup finals next 
weekend at Are, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Skiing Notes 
</P>
<P>
A special hourlong season finale of "Subaru Ski World" will be shown on ESPN 
Tuesday at 9 p.m., featuring "the best of the best" from Bob Beattie's 15-week 
series. It will be repeated Wednesday at 7 p.m. . . . Colorado resorts, from 
Steamboat to Aspen, are up to their Rockies in powder after a series of midweek 
snowstorms. 
</P>
<P>
Racers on the Women's Pro Ski circuit will compete today and Sunday at Sierra 
Summit, in the Central Sierra east of Fresno. . . . The men on the U.S. Pro 
Tour will take a break from their Million Dollar Plymouth Super Series for a 
meet this weekend at Sugarbush, Vt., then will go to Niigata, Japan, next 
weekend. Bernhard Knauss of Austria tops the standings with 402 1/2 points, and 
American Phil Mahre is fifth with 337 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Bear Mountain, at Big Bear Lake, will stage the Jose Cuervo Games of Winter, a 
mixture of events, today, then hold the Chevrolet Truck All-American Ski Outing 
Sunday. . . . Connie Stevens' celebrity races, produced by David Mirisch, are 
adding some glitz to the slopes at Jackson Hole, Wyo., this weekend.

SLOW TICKET SALES FORCE SCALE-BACK OF AIDS BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Claiming that the show will definitely go on, organizers of an AIDS benefit 
featuring Soviet ballerina Maya Plisetskaya and leading opera singers from 
around the world said Friday that they have sold only one-sixth of the tickets 
for Sunday's event in Pasadena and have had to scale back the gala because of a 
failure to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket prices have been reduced but if sales don't improve, organizers said 
that instead of raising $500,000 for the AIDS Hospice Foundation as they had 
hoped, they could wind up losing tens of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"We've still got a damn good show, but we've had to cut, cut, cut, cut, cut," 
said Alan Sievewright, producer of the International Gala of Opera and Ballet 
benefit, scheduled for 7 p.m. Sunday at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of factors was being blamed for the situation, including charges of 
public disinterest in AIDS, but there was also finger-pointing among the 
organizers over how the event was managed. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never experienced anything in Europe the way I've experienced it here," 
said Sievewright, who has been presenting operas and concerts in England for 
two decades but never in the United States. "I've had some wonderful help, but 
nobody seems to give a damn about anything to do with AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
According to organizers, among those scheduled to appear Sunday are American 
sopranos Martina Arroyo and Veronika Diamond, Hungarian soprano Sylvia Sass, 
English soprano Elizabeth Connell, and Louis Lebherz of the Los Angeles Music 
Center Opera. 
</P>
<P>
Bolshoi Ballet dancers Vitali Artyushkin and Alla Khaniashvili-Artyushkina will 
perform two pas de deux, and Plisetskaya, 65, will dance her signature piece, 
"The Dying Swan." Actress Jane Seymour will host the program. 
</P>
<P>
But organizers said they could not afford air fare for Spanish soprano Victoria 
de los Angeles, German soprano Marika Napier, Danish ballet dancer Peter 
Schaufuss and members of the English National Ballet (formerly the London 
Festival Ballet), and Greek tenor Mario Frangoulis, a 24-year-old newcomer who 
was to make his U.S. debut, all previously announced participants. 
</P>
<P>
(Ballerina Lynn Seymour, formerly principal at the Royal Ballet of London, will 
not appear because of an ankle injury, officials said.) 
</P>
<P>
In some instances, more ambitious staging also had to be abandoned, said Roland 
Brown, a member of From the Heart, an independent committee that raises money 
for the AIDS Hospice Foundation and is helping to organize Sunday's event. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the event, originally priced from $25 to $300, have now been 
reduced to $25, $50 and $100. A $500 ticket includes a post-performance 
reception, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Committee treasurer Patricia Naidorf said that only 500 tickets for the 
3,000-seat auditorium had been sold as of Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
One corporation has donated money: 20th Century Fox, at Brown's request, gave 
$5,000 for scenery by artist David Hockney that was commissioned for the gala, 
she said. And some plane tickets, hotel rooms and a special flooring for the 
ballet dancers have also been donated. In addition, From the Heart committee 
members have given $50,000 out of their own pockets, Naidorf said. 
</P>
<P>
But expenses (including $45,000 for the Pasadena Symphony, pay for stage hands 
and theater rental) total about $190,000 so far and if ticket sales -- which 
totaled $50,000 as of Friday morning -- don't pick up, Naidorf said, the 
organizers stand to lose tens of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"People say this is a late town, that people don't buy tickets until the last 
minute," she said. "I hope that's true." 
</P>
<P>
Sievewright and Brown, who have produced benefits together before, attributed 
their money problems to a combination of factors, including broken promises of 
funding and disinterest in the cause. 
</P>
<P>
One corporation had "said they would present $15,000, and $1,000 came," said 
Sievewright, refusing to name the firm. "I think a lot of people let the (AIDS 
foundation) down in a bad way. I'm horrified." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, whose West Hollywood home serves as the organizers' headquarters, said 
he wasn't sure whether support for AIDS was currently "fashionable." "Ecology 
is fashionable at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
But organizers laid much of the blame to Conway and Associates, a Los Angeles 
event-management firm hired by the From the Heart committee. Brown charged that 
the firm, which has organized fund-raisers for Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), 
other individuals and ventures, failed miserably in publicizing the event, and 
in finding a single major corporate funder and support from individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Conway and Associates "just didn't know what they were doing and they took on 
something which they did not understand," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Conway vice president Robert Ellis refuted these accusations, saying that the 
firm was hired only to assist the effort and that the "guts and the heart of 
any fund-raiser, mailings of invitations to the event," were handled entirely 
by the From the Heart Committee. 
</P>
<P>
As for corporate sponsorship, Ellis said that corporations determine their 
major contributions "a year in advance. We've only been on this job for 90 
days. . . . And we are not responsible for any ticket sales. All tickets sales 
were handled through Ticketron and the (Pasadena Civic Auditorium) box office."

WARM AFI TRIBUTE TO DAVID LEAN; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: CREATOR OF 'LAWRENCE OF ARABIA' AND 'DR. ZHIVAGO' MIXES HUMOR WITH 
CRITICISM OF COMMERCIALISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lectures, like loin of lamb, are best served warm, and those people at the 
American Film Institute's tribute to David Lean at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on 
Thursday night got both. 
</P>
<P>
The 81-year-old Lean, whose wide-screen masterpieces include "Lawrence of 
Arabia," "The Bridge on the River Kwai" and "Doctor Zhivago," mixed wry British 
humor with the stern tone of a schoolmaster in lecturing his high-powered and 
captive Hollywood audience for its cautious, commercially homogenized films. 
</P>
<P>
Lean, asking to be forgiven his presumption, said that he got the green light 
for his long-planned adaptation of Joseph Conrad's "Nostromo" just two hours 
before arriving at the hotel, and it was high time, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
"After months and months of talk," he said, "(it's) sort of asinine (to get the 
go-ahead for a film) only two hours before receiving this great honor." 
</P>
<P>
Lean -- taking the podium after a parade of tributes from old friends and such 
contemporary film makers as Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese and Lawrence 
Kasdan -- tempered his scorn for the greed that he says governs Hollywood with 
his own passion for the medium. "I speak from the heart and because I love 
movies," he said, before delivering his apparently off-the-cuff lecture. 
</P>
<P>
Lean quoted Noel Coward, with whom he made his directorial debut in the 1942 
wartime drama, "In Which We Serve," as telling him to "always come out of 
another hole," to be surprising and daring. "We don't come out of any more new 
holes," Lean said. "We come out with Parts One, Two, Three and Four, and I 
think it's terribly sad." 
</P>
<P>
Lean said a staple diet of repeated themes "will sink us" and urged the studios 
to take risks, especially with young talent. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind for old birds like me -- we can take it -- but we have to protect 
our young. Please, you chaps in the money department, look out for the young 
ones. . . . This business lives on creative pathfinders." 
</P>
<P>
Coming from Lean, especially in the wake of clips from such films as "Kwai," 
"Lawrence," "Brief Encounter," "Great Expectations" and "Oliver Twist," the 
blunt criticism of current film making was taken enthusiastically. Lean had 
made similar comments during a tribute at Cannes last year and left that 
audience aghast. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night's industry crowd was treated to one of the briskest and most 
seriously reverent tributes in the award's 18-year history. John Mills, whose 
David Lean films included "Ryan's Daughter" and "Great Expectations," flew 22 
hours "with no pay at the end of it" to honor Lean in person. Also on hand was 
composer Maurice Jarre ("Dr. Zhivago," "Lawrence of Arabia"), who spoke of 
Lean's lessons in "humility, tenacity and perfectionism." 
</P>
<P>
One of the evening's highlights was the appearance -- live via satellite from 
London, where it was 4 a.m. -- of Omar Sharif, who portrayed Zhivago, and Peter 
O'Toole, who co-starred with Sharif in "Lawrence of Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
Steven Spielberg told Lean and the audience that "Bridge on the River Kwai" and 
"Lawrence of Arabia" were the two films "that most made me want to be a film 
maker." Lawrence Kasdan told of how he and his brother had arrived seven 
minutes late for a showing of "Lawrence" and decided to wait six hours for it 
to begin again rather than go in late because "every moment" of a David Lean 
movie mattered. Martin Scorsese spoke of Lean's "landscapes of the spirit -- 
there's no such thing as an empty landscape in a David Lean film."

<P>
Given the consistent insight, heart and individual vision of John Prine's work 
since his debut nearly 20 years ago, it's a grievous oversight that America 
hasn't named him its poet laureate, or at least President. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, as "respected artist" has increasingly become a code word for 
"virtually unheard-of artist," the singer-songwriter has had no airplay to 
speak of and for the last seven years has had his records released only on his 
own cottage-industry Oh-Boy Records. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as his career has sojourned along at the speed of shoes, Prine has built a 
rightly fanatical following, evident in the hero's welcome that greeted him 
when he took the stage Thursday for the first of two nights at the Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
Much like the wonderfully representative 1988 "John Prine Live" album -- 
recorded chiefly at the Coach House -- his 31-song set drew from all points of 
his career and, as such, explored many of the avenues and byways of American 
life. 
</P>
<P>
The most easily communicated of Prine's qualities is his humor. Examples 
Thursday included his "Let's Talk Dirty in Hawaiian"; an ode to organ donors 
("Please don't bury me in the cold, cold ground/I'd rather have them cut me up 
and pass me all around"), and a wealth of anecdotes, including a recent 
experience in Berlin. He bought a chunk of the Berlin Wall from a street 
vendor, he said, mostly because it looked like his home state of Illinois. 
Paying with too-large a bill, he was given a rock-size piece of wall as change. 
</P>
<P>
"They must have thought we were Fred and Wilma Flintstone," Prine deadpanned. 
</P>
<P>
He had gone with friends to Berlin in January "to see what fresh-baked freedom 
smells like right out of the oven." He came back with a new song, which 
included the lines: 
</P>
<P>
I want your East German kisses on my West German face 
</P>
<P>
 We'll hang old Gorby's picture up above the fireplace. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If you show me your lederhosen, I'll take you to a shopping mall 
</P>
<P>
 Because tonight we're going dancing on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 While covering the more crass and commercial aspects of the border's opening, 
his loose-gravel voice added a sense of wistfulness and one-to-one romance to 
the song. And its celebratory tone perhaps caught the moment better than all 
the laborious tomes written about the wall coming down. 
</P>
<P>
Prine mixed the fantastic with the commonplace in "The Bottomless Lake." To the 
question of just what goes on in a car sinking in a bottomless lake, Prine 
posited a family eating chicken legs and smoking all available cigarettes, 
while: 
</P>
<P>
Papa played the music on the radio 
</P>
<P>
 Mama rocked the baby to sleep 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would have taken the other road 
</P>
<P>
 But he didn't think the lake was this deep. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't merely a clever wordsmith behind Prine's wry smile. Rather, like a 
Mark Twain with a guitar, his lyrics could often be at once funny, bittersweet 
and true. 
</P>
<P>
With such imagery as "heat lightning burnt the sky like alcohol" or the 
childhood memory of Green River, "where the air smelled like snakes," Prine 
needed no more than the space of a song to create a palpable world. The latter 
line is from his "Paradise," a powerfully evocative song that uses the true 
story of a childhood haunt being strip-mined as a metaphor for lost innocence. 
</P>
<P>
These often mean-spirited times are encapsulated in one line from his "People 
Puttin' People Down": "People without love sometimes build a fence around the 
garden up above." One of the most heartbreaking songs of the last 20 years must 
be his "Sam Stone," with a child's-eye view of a broken Vietnam veteran: 
"There's a hole in daddy's arm where the money goes." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Prine delivered it right after the uproarious "Let's Talk Dirty in 
Hawaiian," his "Hello in There" ached with the isolation of aging. It was that 
parallel ache and absurdity running through Prine's show, perhaps, that gave 
the performance such a palpable sense of life.

MUSEUM MAKES NAME FOR ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a 17-year docent of the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana ("Bowers Museum Grapples 
With Its Identity," Feb. 4), I have proprietary interest and enthusiasm for the 
museum. There are lots of things going on and great plans for the future. 
</P>
<P>
Armand Labbe, chief curator, Paul Apodaca, curator of folk art, and Paul 
Johnson, exhibit designer, are already working on the details of the exhibits 
planned for the renovated museum. 
</P>
<P>
The museum does still have one gallery open featuring an exhibit of Indian and 
Eskimo artifacts and entitled "Where We Live is How We Live." Docent tours are 
scheduled through June. 
</P>
<P>
Apodaca curated a recent exhibit of Bowers artifacts at the Mission museum in 
San Juan Capistrano, and Labbe curated a current exhibit at the Irvine Fine 
Arts Center that features Peruvian textiles from the museum collection. More 
such exhibits are planned for the renovation period. 
</P>
<P>
The museum name also has become known through sales of a docent-written book 
entitled "How to Write a Better Tour." Copies have been sold throughout the 
United States and Canada and were eagerly sought after at the recent national 
docent symposium in Washington, where Bowers docent Ruth Seigle led a seminar. 
</P>
<P>
The Docent Guild will continue its outreach programs during the renovation. The 
Mini-Museum section takes programs into the classroom and offers seven 
different subjects designed to tie in with the museum collections and augment 
the curriculum studies. Already this school year, (the Guild has) reached 8,000 
children, traveled 3,000 miles and volunteered 315 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The Senior Outreach goes into retirement and rest homes as well as to various 
organizations. Rest- home personnel praise the therapeutic value of the 
presentations. 
</P>
<P>
The Speakers Bureau has a number of varied topics available, all of which tie 
in with the museum collections, and has booked 85 presentations so far this 
school year.

SEATTLE MINISTER BRUCE LARSON TO JOIN SCHULLER AS CRYSTAL CATHEDRAL ASSOCIATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time since the Rev. Robert H. Schuller founded the Garden Grove 
Community Church at a drive-in movie theater 35 years ago, he will be joined by 
a co-pastor. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Bruce Larson, 64, senior pastor at 3,600-member University 
Presbyterian Church in Seattle, will begin his work at the Crystal Cathedral 
this June, Schuller, 63, announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
Schuller will spend most of his time running his television ministry and will 
continue to conduct Sunday services for broadcast on his "Hour of Power" 
television show, church officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A church spokeswoman said the appointment does not mean that Schuller intends 
to change his plans to hand over the ministries to his son, Robert A. Schuller, 
in another 10 years or so. 
</P>
<P>
"I am strictly the No. 2 man (at the Crystal Cathedral)," Larson, said in a 
telephone interview. "I am there to assist Bob to help build and bless that 
congregation."

THE STAMP ACT; 
</P>
<P>
HOBBIES: TAKE A RUBBER STAMP. ADD ONE OF A MULTITUDE OF MEDIUMS. THERE YOU HAVE 
IT: INSTANT ART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a movement afoot to stamp out art. News about this movement has spread 
through retail outlets and specialty stores. It has its own magazine, books and 
devotees, who have turned it into a multimillion-dollar industry. 
</P>
<P>
Who is at the forefront of this movement? People who have discovered the art of 
the rubber stamp. 
</P>
<P>
From young children to adults, these are people who have never thought of 
themselves as artists but yearn to create. 
</P>
<P>
Cyndi Fox, a self-described minor stamp artist, says: "Stamps allow the average 
person to feel creative. You don't have to be an artist, you just have to be 
able to hit a pad with a stamp and voila! You're as good as Picasso ever was." 
</P>
<P>
Fox, who works at See Spot Run, a rubber stamp emporium at Los Angeles' Farmers 
Market, may exaggerate a bit. But many noted artists have used rubber stamps. 
</P>
<P>
The Dada movement in the 1920s prominently featured rubber stamp images. Saul 
Steinberg, Andy Warhol and Sister Corita Kent dabbled in stamp art techniques. 
Sixties buffs may remember "Be Here Now" by Baba Ram Dass, a counterculture 
classic completely illustrated by rubber stamp art. 
</P>
<P>
Stamping and mailing have always gone together. In the late '50s, there was 
even a "Correspondence Art" movement with hundreds of artists sending their 
rubber stamped art to each other -- in effect, using the mail as a gallery 
wall. (Some stampers swear Elvis was caught up in this movement; witness his 
testimonial anthem "Return to Sender.") 
</P>
<P>
But before art, there was commerce. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1860s, Charles Goodyear perfected the process of vulcanizing and curing 
rubber, thus making it possible to mold and hold an impression. The U.S. Post 
Office was one of his first customers; "Return to Sender" and "Postage Due" 
were among the first rubber stamps. Today, the postal service owns what many 
believe to be the largest collection of rubber stamps in the world. 
</P>
<P>
While the post office may use the most stamps, its message is hardly artistic. 
For Art with a capital A, prospective stampers have to get their hands on a 
stamp. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at them they're fun; when you hold them and use them they're 
fun," says Gary Dorothy, owner of Stampa Barbara, the nation's largest rubber 
stamp store with about 75,000 stamps. 
</P>
<P>
"And when you receive something that's been stamped, it's delightful." 
</P>
<P>
Several enthusiastic stampers were browsing through Dorothy's shop recently. 
One 7-year-old was looking for a gift for her violin teacher; the debate over 
the rabbit playing a violin and a frog playing a violin was a long one. 
</P>
<P>
Comedian Mark Pitta was shopping for ways to stand out from the crowd. He 
decided on a stamp that portrays "Really Ugly Ties." 
</P>
<P>
As he watches his customers shop, Dorothy observes: "People will say, 'I'm not 
creative.' But they really are. They just haven't had the right medium. People 
learned early on that they weren't good at drawing and painting, but rubber 
stamps help them change that perception about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Forged in rubber, ready and waiting for the artist are stamps of birds and 
bees, flowers and trees, 747s and Model Ts. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday stamps celebrate St. Patrick's Day, Easter, Halloween and Christmas; 
Valentine's Day sentiments can be celebrated year 'round, with hearts and 
roses, kissing couples and even a few mildly naughty motifs. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of stamps is overwhelming. Teddy bears, kittens and rabbits are 
predictable favorites, as are names, monograms and smiling faces. 
</P>
<P>
But your choices are hardly limited to the warm and fuzzy. You can buy: 
</P>
<P>
* A picnic pack of stamps -- complete with food, drink, trees and even ants. 
</P>
<P>
* A political slogan, a caricature of George Bush or Mikhail Gorbachev, 
"Boycott Exxon," or "Peace and Freedom in Central America." 
</P>
<P>
* Christians can spread the word with praying hands, doves and "Praise the 
Lord" stamps. 
</P>
<P>
* Southwestern buffs can stamp out cacti, adobes, pottery and the likeness of 
Georgia O'Keeffe. 
</P>
<P>
But the art is in the stamping, not the stamp, so you need an array of 
accessories to make your mark. 
</P>
<P>
First, because every message needs a medium, you must decide what to stamp. 
Your choices include stickers, gift tags, refrigerator magnets, bookmarks, door 
hangers, greeting cards, party hats, ribbons, gift bags, lunch bags and 
stationery and envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the artist can choose from an array of supplies that give color, texture 
and dimension to stamping. Stamp pads range from metallic inks to brilliant 
colors. Glitter glue, watercolor markers, embossing powders, ribbons, flowers 
and jewels complete the polymer palette. 
</P>
<P>
These supplies can be purchased through mail-order catalogues from a number of 
small companies bearing names like Stamp Francisco, the Rubber Room, Repeat 
Business and Bizzaro. Until recently, the dedicated stamper had to shop by 
mail. But of late, Southland retailers have gotten into the stamp act. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Harris, 68, has a collection of more than 12,000 stamps. She makes 
several pilgrimages a year up the coast to Stampa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I bought my stamps and supplies just from catalogues," she said. 
"But when the specialty stamping stores opened, I went hog-wild and crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Also boosting the stamp craze is Rubberstampmadness, a magazine published in 
Ithaca, N.Y. The editor, Roberta Sperling, puts her editorial stamp on her 
publication under the byline Rubberta Stampling. The tabloid includes product 
reviews, personality profiles and design techniques. 
</P>
<P>
The current issue features an article about stamping out stress and another 
that boasts of the therapeutic benefits stamping provides for the criminally 
insane -- and for those who are just a little crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbie Boschan, who owns Stamp Stamp Stamp in Santa Monica Place, suggests that 
stamping may very well be the perfect art form for the '90s. It's fast, it's 
fun, it holds your attention, and it grabs the attention of others. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a hobby that offers instant gratification," Boschan says. "It's not 
like trying to learn the piano." 
</P>
<P>
All in all, stamping is a very stimulating experience, Boschan says. 
</P>
<P>
"Put a rubber stamp down of a bird, and you can make it fly off the page." 
</P>
<P>
Rubber stamp outlets in Southern California include:

WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH CELEBRATES TRIUMPHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY JO HILL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Molly Murphy MacGregor thought being a woman was something to be proud of, 
something to be celebrated. That's why in 1978 she helped launch a one-day 
event in Sonoma County to honor women and their achievements. 
</P>
<P>
Three years after that, National Women's History Week was started as support 
for the idea of celebrating women and their contributions to American life 
grew. In 1987, National Women's History Month was born with a Congressional 
proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
March is National Women's History Month. Southland events scheduled to mark the 
monthlong celebration include art exhibits, theatrical presentations, special 
award programs and seminars on topics that reflect this year's theme -- 
"Courageous Voices Echoing in Our Lives." 
</P>
<P>
The theme "really speaks to the spirit of and the action of the women who have 
proceeded us," MacGregor says. Women, she says, need "to realize that they are 
part of that continuity." 
</P>
<P>
MacGregor heads up the National Women's History Project in Windsor, Calif., 
which promotes the rediscovery of women's history by creating resource 
materials for schools, churches and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The celebration honors more than famous women, MacGregor says. "We want to say 
we are recognizing all women, all cultural backgrounds . . . women who work 
outside the home and inside the home, young and old -- all women." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Rose, executive director of the Los Angeles City Commission on the Status 
of Women, says: "There really is a need to recognize the achievements of women, 
and the fact here is that their contribution -- the role of American women in 
history -- had been consistently overlooked and undervalued, both in history 
and literature, throughout the social sciences that we study. . . . This is a 
real effort to recognize their accomplishments and achievements." 
</P>
<P>
The commission serves as an advocate on women's issues such as child care, 
sexual harassment in the workplace and empowerment of women of color. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a statement of purpose around Women's History Month that talks about 
the critical role women have played as part of the labor force, the unique role 
they have played as volunteers, their participation in the establishment of 
early charitable and cultural institutions in our country," Rose says. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at March as a time to celebrate, and that's the underlying approach to 
Women's History (Month): to recognize and celebrate womens' achievements. The 
more we recognize . . . women's accomplishments and achievements, I think the 
more that will be significant for young girls who need role models to follow." 
</P>
<P>
Here is a sampling of Women's History Month events around the Southland:

Archeologists believe that when Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo discovered Southern 
California for Spain in 1542, there were more than 20,000 American Indians 
living in the area. And there is evidence that people lived here for at least 
10,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
When the Spaniards arrived, they found that the two largest Indian groups in 
today's Los Angeles area -- the Chumash and Gabrielino -- were accomplished 
artists and skilled craftsmen, adept at making a living from the sea and land. 
Food was so abundant they did not need to farm. They lived in large villages 
with a hierarchy of rulers and a division of labor among skilled artisans. 
</P>
<P>
Some created finely woven baskets and carved bowls. Others made shell beads for 
jewelry and money. Carpenters built large canoes from wooden planks for 
deep-sea fishing and travel to the Channel Islands. Religious leaders painted 
or carved intricate designs on rocks as part of a rich ceremonial life. 
</P>
<P>
During the 17th and 18th centuries, many Indians died of European diseases and 
from the shock of being relocated from their tribal lands to the missions, 
where they worked as laborers. With these changes, a vital cultural legacy of 
several thousand years was forever altered, but not completely lost. 
</P>
<P>
How can you learn more about these first Californians? There are dozens of 
places to look. What follows is a list of some of the best. 
</P>
<P>
1) VISIT AN INDIAN MUSEUM 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 30 museums in Southern California with exhibits of 
artifacts made by local native groups. Among the most complete are: 
</P>
<P>
* SOUTHWEST MUSEUM, 234 Museum Drive, Los Angeles, (213) 221-2163 
</P>
<P>
Four main exhibit halls spotlight North America's earliest inhabitants. 
Highlights in the "People of California" exhibit include a replica of a cave 
painted with Chumash rock art, an acorn granary with a display of mortars used 
for grinding acorn flour, and a basket collection. Open Tuesday-Sunday, 11 
a.m.-5 p.m. Adults, $3; seniors and students, $1.50; ages 7-18, $1; under 7, 
free. 
</P>
<P>
* SANTA BARBARA MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY, 2559 Puesta del Sol Road, Santa 
Barbara, (805) 682-4711. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's "Indian Hall" displays an unrivaled collection of Chumash 
artifacts. In the museum's Fleischmann Auditorium, look for the replica of a 
tomol, a Chumash wood-plank canoe. Open daily 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Sundays and 
holidays from 10 a.m. Free. 
</P>
<P>
2) ATTEND AN AMERICAN INDIAN FESTIVAL 
</P>
<P>
Several museums present powwows or Indian fiestas in Southern California, 
including two annual festivals: 
</P>
<P>
* AMERICAN INDIAN FESTIVAL, Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, (213) 
744-3414. March 23-25. 
</P>
<P>
Indians from the Southwestern United States, including California, perform 
dances, demonstrate artistic skills and sell their wares at this three-day 
festival. Adults, $3; ages 13-17 and seniors, $1; ages 5-12, 75 cents; under 5, 
free. 
</P>
<P>
* MALKI MUSEUM ANNUAL FIESTA AND BARBECUE, Morongo Indian Reservation, 11-795 
Fields Road, Banning, (714) 849-7289. May 27. 
</P>
<P>
Cahuilla Bird Dancers, Sherman Indian Museum Hoop Dancers, and dancers or 
storytellers from other California Indian groups perform throughout the day. 
Free. 
</P>
<P>
3) TAKE A CLASS 
</P>
<P>
Universities, community colleges and museums offer courses and lectures on 
California Indian subjects ranging from rock art and mythology to 
basketry-making techniques. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* UCLA EXTENSION, Los Angeles, (213) 825-9971. 
</P>
<P>
* VENTURA COUNTY MUSEUM OF HISTORY AND ART, 100 E. Main St., Ventura, (805) 
653-0323. 
</P>
<P>
4) GO TO A MISSION 
</P>
<P>
Local Indians built and lived at California missions between 1770 and 1830. Two 
missions that tell the story of the Indians best are: 
</P>
<P>
* LA PURISIMA MISSION STATE HISTORICAL PARK, 12 miles west of Buellton on 
Highway 246, Lompoc, (805) 733-3713. 
</P>
<P>
The only California mission run by the state, La Purisima was restored to its 
1800s splendor by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. The mission 
takes visitors back to the old days because of its isolation and the fact that 
all its buildings, not just the church, were reconstructed. Weaving rooms, 
kitchens with Indian grinding stones resting on dirt floors, and cow hides 
tanning in the sun recreate those early times. Open daily, 9 a.m.-5 p.m. 
Adults, $1; ages 6-17, 50 cents; under 6 free. 
</P>
<P>
* MISSION SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, at Camino Capistrano and Ortega Highway (74), 
San Juan Capistrano, (714) 493-1111. 
</P>
<P>
Visit the American Indian area on the mission grounds to see a replica of an 
Indian shelter and grinding stones used to make acorn flour. An adjacent museum 
displays Indian artifacts discovered during excavations at the mission. Open 
daily, 7:30 a.m.-5 p.m. Adults, $2; children under 11, $1. 
</P>
<P>
5) VISIT AN ARCHEOLOGICAL SITE 
</P>
<P>
Few archeological sites have survived in Southern California. The ruins at San 
Juan Capistrano Mission are one exception. Another dig site you can visit is: 
</P>
<P>
* ALBINGER ARCHEOLOGICAL MUSEUM, 113 E. Main St., Ventura, (805) 648-5823. 
</P>
<P>
An extensive excavation during 1974-75 uncovered artifacts dating back 3,500 
years. Archeologists found a particularly large number of objects from the 
Chumash village of Mitz-kana-kan, which occupied the site for more than 1,000 
years. Remains from this Indian occupation are on display at the adjacent 
museum, along with artifacts from Spanish, Mexican, Chinese and Analo pioneers 
who lived in the area. Open Tuesday-Sunday, 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Free. 
</P>
<P>
6) TAKE A GUIDED HIKE 
</P>
<P>
Many natural areas offer docent-led hikes to help visitors understand how early 
inhabitants lived off the land. Some of the best: 
</P>
<P>
* SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS NATIONAL RECREATION AREA, National Park Service 
Visitor Information Center, 30401 Agoura Road, Suite 102, Agoura Hills, (818) 
597-9192. 
</P>
<P>
A group of more than 30 parks stretches across the Santa Monica Mountains from 
Franklin Canyon Ranch in Beverly Hills to Point Mugu State Park north of 
Malibu. Many of the parks offer hikes led by docents or rangers who teach 
participants about the area's Indians and and their use of the land. Call for a 
schedule of hikes. 
</P>
<P>
* DESERT STUDIES CENTER, Soda Springs. From Interstate 15, take the Zzyzx Road 
off-ramp near Baker, (619) 256-3591. 
</P>
<P>
Take a guided tour of ancient Indian sites to learn how Indians lived in the 
desert. Sponsored by the Desert Studies Consortium and the Bureau of Land 
Management, tours are conducted from October-April on most weekends at 10 a.m., 
noon, and 2 p.m. Per person, $2; family, $5. 
</P>
<P>
7) SEE INDIAN ART 
</P>
<P>
Many California Indian tribes left behind paintings (pictographs) and carvings 
(petroglyphs) on rocks. Because much of this exquisite rock art has been 
destroyed by vandals, remaining sites are protected. One site can be seen on 
the tour at the Desert Studies Center. Another site you can visit is: 
</P>
<P>
* PAINTED CAVE STATE HISTORIC PARK, San Marcos Pass. 
</P>
<P>
This sandstone shelter contains a spectacular Chumash polychrome painting. The 
age of the complicated designs are not known, although one theory suggests the 
painting may have been made at the time of a solar eclipse in 1677. 
</P>
<P>
To reach the cave, drive north from U.S. Highway 101 on San Marcos Pass Road 
(Highway 154) 6 miles to Painted Cave Road; turn right to a shady canyon with a 
sign pointing to the cave. 
</P>
<P>
8) SAIL TO AN ISLAND 
</P>
<P>
CHANNEL ISLANDS NATIONAL PARK, Visitor Center, 1901 Spinnaker Drive, Ventura, 
(805) 644-8262. 
</P>
<P>
Five islands in the Santa Barbara Channel -- Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, 
San Miguel and Santa Barbara -- were once home for seafaring Chumash who lived 
on these islands and regularly crossed the channel in their canoes. Stop by the 
mainland Visitor Center to see a display of Chumash artifacts, pleasantly 
labeled "Please touch." Open daily, 8 a.m.-5 p.m. Free. 
</P>
<P>
* ISLAND PACKERS, the transportation concession for the park, offers daily boat 
excursions to the islands. The two best islands for learning about Indian life 
are Anacapa and Santa Cruz. Nature Conservancy guides describe life on the 
Islands before European contact. 
</P>
<P>
Island Packers, 1867 Spinnaker Drive, Ventura, (805) 642-1393. Reservations 
required for island tours. Day trips to Anacapa and Santa Cruz islands: Adults, 
$34 and $39; ages 3-12, $18 and $29; under 2, free. 
</P>
<P>
9) VISIT AN INDIAN PARK 
</P>
<P>
SATWIWA NATIVE AMERICAN INDIAN NATURAL AREA, Rancho Sierra Vista/Satwiwa, at 
Potrero Road and Pinehill Road, Newbury Park, (818) 597-9192. 
</P>
<P>
Located in foothills inhabited by the Chumash Indians for perhaps 2,000 years, 
Satwiwa Native American Indian Natural Area sits on a grassy plain below Boney 
Mountain, a peak sacred to the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
The Indian Natural Area is open daily. The cultural center is open Sundays, 9 
a.m.-5 p.m. Free. 
</P>
<P>
* INDIAN CANYONS, at south end of South Palm Canyon Drive, Palm Springs, (619) 
325-5673. 
</P>
<P>
Andreas Canyon, Murray Canyon and Palm Canyon are desert oases, once tribal 
home sites for the Agua Caliente Cahuilla Indians. Today you can pack a picnic 
and hike or ride on horseback along ancient canyon trails. Under majestic palms 
and along running streams, you'll spot Indian house pits, irrigation ditches, 
food processing areas and petroglyphs. Open daily, September-May, 8 a.m.-4:30 
p.m. Adults, $3; seniors, $2; children, 75 cents. 
</P>
<P>
10) READ A BOOK 
</P>
<P>
You'll find books about Southern California Indians at the museums mentioned 
above and at some bookstores. Three readily available books are: 
</P>
<P>
* HANDBOOK OF THE INDIANS OF CALIFORNIA, A.L. Kroeber, Dover Publications, New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
* CALIFORNIA'S CHUMASH INDIANS, McCall and Perry, Santa Barbara Museum of 
Natural History, Santa Barbara. 
</P>

HONOR FOR EVERETT BRINGS RESPONSE FROM THE HEART

L.A. Rams quarterback Jim Everett was honored Tuesday at a banquet hosted by 
the CHOC Padrinos, a men's support group of Childrens Hospital of Orange 
County. The $100-per-person benefit drew 450 men and half a dozen women to the 
Irvine Marriott for silent and live auctions, a steak dinner and a few 
surprising moments of unchecked emotion when Everett accepted his Sportsman of 
the Year award. 
</P>
<P>
Roasted 
</P>
<P>
Master of ceremonies John Robinson -- a.k.a. the Rams' coach -- gave the 
business-suited crowd a 15-minute pep talk larded with quarterback quips. 
(Everett soaked it in from a front row seat, where he sat with his girlfriend, 
Kristina Beatty, his smiling face upturned to his boss). 
</P>
<P>
"I look out at this group and I'm reminded of my team (meetings)," joked 
Robinson. "The left side of the room's drunk. The middle of the room's asleep. 
The right side is too dumb to know what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim always sits on the right side of the room," the coach added. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson noted happily that he had not won the centerpiece on his banquet table 
-- one of the Everett-signed gym shoes plunked unappetizingly amid salad plates 
and wine glasses and coffee cups. "Imagine me going home, 'Honey, look what I 
won! Jim Everett's shoe!' " Robinson said. His advice to the winners: "Bury the 
damn thing in the yard." 
</P>
<P>
Winning, of course, was Robinson's theme -- why the Rams didn't win their way 
to the Super Bowl, how they were going to win seasons yet unplayed. The key to 
all that winning and would-be winning, said Robinson, is Jim Everett. "He 
epitomizes success." 
</P>
<P>
Prime Time 
</P>
<P>
After guests watched a video montage of Everett's moves on the field and a 
recent tour through CHOC, the quarterback stepped up to the podium. He flicked 
a few punch lines back at his coach. Then he started to talk about the children 
he'd visited in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are fighting for life," Everett said, his voice thickening with 
emotion. "Some of these kids might not make it to tomorrow. . . . I'm sorry to 
break down like this," he said, wiping his reddened eyes. 
</P>
<P>
For several tear-filled minutes, Everett braved his way through his heartfelt 
message of hope, ending to a standing ovation as he presented Padrinos 
president Richard Sparrow with a personal check for lifetime membership to the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Check 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the program, Sparrow made his own check presentation: $200,000 to 
Mel Miller, president of the CHOC Foundation, and Howard Jones, chairman of the 
board of CHOC. The check -- one of those poster-sized mock-ups -- represented 
net proceeds from a year of the Padrinos' fund-raising events. It is the second 
of five such checks the group plans to donate annually to help underwrite a new 
neonatal intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
Other Guys 
</P>
<P>
Glen Allen, chairman of the benefit, led a banquet committee that included Sid 
Adler, Jeff Morris, Tim Redmond, Jay Brown, Kelly Munson, Tim Scanlon, Doug 
Forde, Ed Slater, Noel Wells and Dave Parsonage. 
</P>
<P>
Attending cocktail hour but gone by dinner: Dr. Ragnar Amlie, of CHOC's 
critical care unit, with Aaron Cunningham, 12, of Yorba Linda; Eddie Arrioja, 
10, of Orange; and Sonya Paulik, 13, of Anaheim. All three children have cystic 
fibrosis and have been patients at CHOC. PAMELA MARIN

West German government sources confirmed that Bonn has evidence that Libya 
produced 30 tons of mustard gas in a test at a chemical plant built with 
assistance from West German companies. "We passed on the information to 
Washington in February," a senior government source said. Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Hanns Schuhmacher said the Bonn government is working "shoulder to 
shoulder" with the Bush Administration in seeking ways to prevent further 
production of the chemical weapons at the Rabta plant, about 60 miles southwest 
of the Libyan capital of Tripoli.

Luo Yunguang, a vice minister of railways, has been ousted for allegedly taking 
bribes, becoming one of the highest-ranking Beijing officials toppled in a 
nationwide campaign against corruption. 
</P>

The official New China News Agency said Luo ignored corruption by his aides and 
personally accepted a gold ring, a refrigerator and the equivalent of $465 in 
bribes. He was the fifth Railways Ministry official accused of corruption in 
the past six months. What he did for the bribes was not specified.

Calling Proposition 103 a "fraud," a state lawmaker who represents eight rural 
Northern California counties proposed a constitutional amendment reinstating 
territorial ratings as the chief factor in setting automobile insurance rates. 
Sen. Jim Nielsen (R-Rohnert Park), vice chairman of the Senate Insurance, 
Claims and Corporations Committee, said banning the use of ZIP codes to price 
insurance under Proposition 103 unfairly forces rural drivers to subsidize 
insurance rates paid by urban dwellers. Nielsen contended that urban areas have 
a higher likelihood of accidents, lawsuits and fraudulent claims.

Pointing out that California ranks 37th of the 50 states in voter 
participation, Secretary of State March Fong Eu called for legislation to make 
it easier for citizens to register to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Eu told a state Senate committee studying ways to encourage more people to vote 
that low voter turnout is a "national shame." She noted in the November general 
election, only 53% voted, the lowest since 1924. Eu called for measures to 
increase voter participation -- particularly among young people, new citizens 
and people on the move -- including such steps as allowing people to register 
while changing the address on their driver's license.

<P>
Citing budgetary constraints, Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed legislation to 
restore $15 million he cut out in funding for community mental health programs. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said it was "inappropriate" to place additional demands on a 
budget whose $1 billion reserve has been cut in half by expenses related to the 
Northern California earthquake. Deukmejian noted that he allowed a bill to 
restore $20 million for family-planning services to become law in late January 
without his signature. At that time, he challenged the lawmakers to reduce 
expenditures in next year's budget.

HAWAII HOTEL STRIKE: SURF'S UP, MAKE YOUR BED 
</P>

<P>
Hotel managers, claiming that disruptions by striking workers have escalated 
out of control, asked a federal judge Friday to limit picketing to avert "blood 
in the streets." The judge said no. 
</P>
<P>
As Hawaii's first statewide hotel strike marked its seventh day, tempers were 
wearing thin for everyone involved, especially the tourists unwittingly caught 
up in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Although the struck hotels have continued operating since 7,500 workers walked 
out last Saturday, it's not quite the Hawaiian vacation that many visitors 
envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
Honeymooners can't have breakfast in bed because room service has been 
suspended. Guests can't even sleep in late, thanks to loud chanting from the 
picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are the soothing sand and waves of Waikiki sacrosanct. Strikers have taken 
to marching up and down the beach with bullhorns bellowing. Even those tourists 
who leave the tourist strip of Waikiki, where the picketing is concentrated, 
return to find beds in their hotel rooms unmade and linen unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of puts you in a bad frame of mind," said Rodney Wilkins, a guest at 
the Hilton Hawaiian Village, the state's largest hotel. "Here we are, paying 
for services that are not being delivered." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, while management headed for court, the union turned its attention to 
a new target. About 300 retired hotel workers picketed the Japanese Consulate 
for more than an hour, chanting, "Fair is fair, we want our share," and, "Hey, 
hey, ho, ho, the Japanese have got to go." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 11 hotels that are struck are Japanese-owned, although negotiations 
are being handled by the Council of Hawaii Hotels, which represents U.S. hotel 
operators, including Hilton, Hyatt and Sheraton. 
</P>
<P>
The council sought help in U.S. District Court, claiming that hundreds of 
pickets had overwhelmed security guards and swarmed onto the grounds of the 
Kahala Hilton on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Management contends that pickets have also disrupted entry to some hotels, 
damaged vehicles and disturbed guests with their chanting. "I do not think this 
court needs to wait until there is blood in the streets to protect the public," 
argued Robert Katz, attorney for the Council of Hawaii Hotels. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Judge Harold Fong disagreed. He denied the motion for a 
temporary restraining order to bar pickets from hotel entrances. "From what 
I've seen, the situation has not turned ugly," he said. "One incident does not 
a riot make." So far, there has been just one arrest on the picket line, he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Rutledge, leader of the Hotel Employees, Restaurant Employees Union, Local 
5, said any violence was the result of security guards overreacting. 
</P>
<P>
The strike affects 9,300 hotel rooms, 16% of the state's total. 
</P>
<P>
The hotels involved in the strike are the Hilton Hawaiian Village, the Hyatt 
Regency Waikiki, the Ilikai, the Kahala Hilton, the Sheraton Waikiki, the 
Sheraton Moana Surfrider, the Princess Kaiulani and the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. 
On neighboring islands, the Sheraton Kauai, Sheraton Maui and Kona Hilton also 
are struck. 
</P>
<P>
As the week has worn on, striking workers have become more unruly, jostling 
cars that cross the lines and yelling insults at strike breakers, according to 
management. Management also contends that the hotel workers' slow shuffle is 
tying up traffic and blocking business. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the spirited rhetoric in the courtroom, negotiations between union and 
management resumed on Friday afternoon. William Crawford, executive director of 
the hotel council, said the two sides have made progress. 
</P>
<P>
Union leader Rutledge agreed that "we're not that far apart." "If they spend 
their energies at the bargaining table, rather than in court, we could get this 
thing settled in a day or two," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Talks broke down last Saturday and pickets hit the streets but the two sides 
returned to the bargaining table Tuesday at the behest of Gov. John Waihee, who 
fears the strike's impact on Hawaii's economy. Tourism is the state's backbone. 
Officials are concerned that news reports will scare off visitors during the 
peak winter season. 
</P>
<P>
There are signs that the strike has not hurt business that much. At United 
Airlines, the carrier that flies the most passengers to Hawaii, "we have not 
seen any impact from the hotel strike," spokesman Joseph Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, in an effort to counteract the impression that the strike has 
"shut down Hawaii," the Hawaii Visitors Bureau is launching a $300,000 
"emergency advertising campaign" in mainland newspapers Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Katz alluded to those concerns in seeking court intervention. "Not only is 
there going to be blood in the streets, but the state economy is going to come 
to a grinding halt because this is going to scare the living daylights out of 
anyone who wants to come to Hawaii," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The strike is the talk of local radio stations and coffee shops. Although the 
hotel workers have substantial public sympathy in this strongly Democratic 
state, some residents are upset at union tactics that aggravate tourists, who 
are Hawaii's bread and butter. One caller to a local radio station stopped his 
car in morning traffic to use a pay phone to register his disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
For some visitors, the strike is a dream turned sour. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish there was some other method of resolving this dispute," said Len 
Hazzard, a visitor from Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
"We're innocent. We only get a couple of weeks holiday here a year." 
</P>

SHEARSON HIRED TO STUDY FLUOR UNIT'S OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fluor Corp. said Friday that it has retained Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. to 
"explore strategic options" for its A. T. Massey Coal Co., raising speculation 
that Fluor may be considering a sale of the highly profitable unit. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor spokeswoman Deborah Land would not rule out the possibility that the 
Richmond, Va., coal company might be sold. 
</P>
<P>
"I never say 'never,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
But she stressed that there are other options for the investment banker to 
study, including the possible expansion of the unit's operations or simply 
maintaining "the status quo." 
</P>
<P>
Herb Hart, an analyst with S. G. Warburg &amp; Co., said Irvine-based Fluor 
would be reluctant to sell Massey unless it got an exceptionally good offer. "I 
think they feel coal is an energy product and Fluor understands energy," said 
Hart, referring to Fluor's longstanding history in the hydrocarbon field. "I 
think they feel all forms of energy have appreciation potential." 
</P>
<P>
There is speculation that legislation to fight acid rain could make low-sulfur 
coal reserves of the kind Massey mines much more valuable. 
</P>
<P>
Hart said he thinks that instead of selling Massey immediately, Fluor "would be 
much more likely to sell stock in Massey to the public, as they did with the 
(St. Joe) gold operation, to establish a value for it." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Fluor spun off 10% of St. Joe Gold, its former gold mining unit, in a 
public stock sale. After testing the market, Fluor the next year sold the rest 
of St. Joe Gold and other gold properties for $500 million in cash.

DREXEL OKS PANEL TO OVERSEE FIRM'S LIQUIDATION

Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. won a battle Friday that allows a panel of 
its outside directors to monitor the winding down of the company instead of 
turning its books over to a court-appointed investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel and First City Bancorp, the head of its creditors committee, told the 
bankruptcy court that they had reached an agreement in which a committee of 
three of Drexel's outside directors would oversee the liquidation process. 
</P>
<P>
However, the accord also provides for a subcommittee of four creditors who will 
be told of transactions before they occur. 
</P>
<P>
Although the creditors cannot demand that Drexel stop a sale, they can ask for 
a delay. If no agreement can be reached, the creditors can appeal to the 
bankruptcy judge. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to overseeing the liquidation process, the oversight committee of 
Drexel directors has the authority to investigate compensation of more than 
$100,000 to anyone who had been an officer or director of Drexel or its 
subsidiaries since Jan. 1, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Creditors and government regulators have been concerned about Drexel's payment 
of some $270 million worth of bonuses several weeks before it filed for 
bankruptcy. The Securities and Exchange Commission is currently investigating 
the payments. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel filed for bankruptcy Feb. 13 but its subsidiaries are not included in 
the filing. Therefore, they are being liquidated without court supervision.

U.S. SPENDS $890 MILLION ON S&amp;L SOLD TO PERELMAN FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal regulators spent an estimated $890 million in taxpayer money to bail 
out a Texas savings institution in a sale to a thrift holding company 
controlled by financier Ronald O. Perelman. 
</P>
<P>
Perelman's holding company, on the other hand, is putting up only $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Resolution Trust Corp., created in August to dispose of failed thrifts, 
sold San Antonio Savings Assn. to First Gibraltar Holdings Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The holding company already owns First Gibraltar Bank, a Dallas-based thrift 
with assets of more than $9 billion. It was formed in 1988 from five smaller 
insolvent S&amp;Ls in a much criticized bailout deal that required $5.1 billion 
in federal assistance and favorable tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the San Antonio S&amp;L will be changed to First Gibraltar Bank, 
but it will be maintained as a separate financial institution. Earlier this 
week, the RTC board voted to allow thrifts created in earlier bailouts to bid 
on newly failed S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
However, because Congress has ordered the RTC to review the old bailouts, the 
agency is requiring First Gibraltar Holdings to maintain the San Antonio 
institution as a separately capitalized entity. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC said First Gibraltar's proposal was the cheapest of seven received. The 
holding company is taking $1.1 billion of San Antonio's $2.3 billion in assets. 
And it agreed to assume responsibility for deposits of $2 billion in 220,000 
accounts and other liabilities of $750 million. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the RTC agreed to advance $1.6 billion to First Gibraltar. The 
agency is keeping about $1.1 billion in sour loans. After those are sold, the 
RTC expects its expenses will total $890 million. 
</P>
<P>
An investor group -- MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings Inc. -- controls First 
Gibraltar Holdings. Its investors include Perelman and Revlon Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas newspapers reported earlier this week that Perelman's group had emerged 
as the winner of a bidding war. Others reportedly interested in the San Antonio 
S&amp;L were NCNB Texas, Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, and Security Pacific 
Corp. of Los Angeles, although Security Pacific denied having submitted a bid.

Oscar Mayer to Shut Vernon Plant: Lunch meat giant Oscar Mayer Foods Corp. will 
close its Vernon processing plant at the end of September, laying off 537 
workers, company officials said. The company, which purchased the plant in 
1951, blamed the closure on high operating costs. Based in Madison, Wis., Oscar 
Mayer operates 21 manufacturing plants nationwide.

QUARRY'S PLANS WORSEN AN ALREADY ROCKY RELATIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The neighbors of Padre Transit Mix in Poway have lived with the rock quarry 
operation for 15 years, and they've had enough of it. 
</P>
<P>
The Calmat Co., which gained control of Padre Transit Mix in 1986, is seeking a 
30-year extension of its conditional-use permit, which expires Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Calmat also hopes to double its 83-acre sand- and gravel-mining operation and 
introduce an asphalt plant and an aggregate-minerals processing plant. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby residents say they are not about to stand for it. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, contends Betty Rexford, is trucks carrying rock and sand from the 
quarry -- they travel the narrow road in front of her house -- the noise from 
rock-crushing equipment and the dust. 
</P>
<P>
"We hear the crashing and crunching of the rocks all the time," said Rexford, 
who lives half a mile from the quarry. "We're gearing up all of Poway to keep 
this out of here. Why should we be known as the sand and gravel capital?" 
</P>
<P>
Calmat representatives argue that any noise will be controlled by use of 
natural and man-made sound barriers. Dust pollution will be minimized by 
frequent watering of dirt roads and wherever sand is being transported. 
</P>
<P>
"We're proposing a state-of-the-art plan, and we feel that we are addressing 
the issues raised by the neighbors," said Robert Imler, Calmat's district 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Truck traffic on narrow, residential Beeler Canyon and Creek roads will be 
eliminated by building a private road north through to Kirkham Road, said 
Imler, who added that rock-mining operations and residential areas have 
coexisted before. 
</P>
<P>
"By and large, it's a pretty much peaceful coexistence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The skeptics remain, however -- despite a tour Calmat gave to concerned 
residents of its other asphalt plants. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing that I am concerned about is the addition of the asphalt plant, 
because I think the canyon is going to smell of asphalt and I don't think 
anyone wants to get up in the morning and smell it," said one resident who went 
on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"The smell wasn't real strong (at the other plants), but it certainly was 
there. It's like when you smell a skunk. It doesn't have to be that strong, but 
you sure know it's there." 
</P>
<P>
The city is waiting for completion of an environmental impact report to 
determine the effects of an expanded plant, not only on neighbors but also on a 
new industrial park to the north. 
</P>
<P>
The road Calmat proposes to build would divert the sand and gravel trucks away 
from residential areas and toward Pomerado Business Park, which includes light 
industry and also hopes to attract retail businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Poway City Councilman Robert Emery said he is skeptical of the quarry. "They 
don't have a very good track record" of living up to former promises, he said. 
</P>
<P>
When Padre Transit Mix received its operating permit in 1975, conditions 
included road improvements and landscaping. According to neighbors, the company 
failed to comply with those conditions for more than 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
After Calmat applied for an extension and expansion of the permit in 1987, 
neighbors submitted to the city a list of conditions Padre Transit Mix had not 
met. Only then were tasks such as paving roads and fencing the property 
completed, said Rexford, the neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
She is concerned that Calmat complied with residents' demands only because it 
wanted approval of the permit extension, and that it will stop complying 
someday. Neighbors still complain of noisy trucks driving at high speed outside 
the permit-stipulated hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., Rexford said. 
</P>
<P>
Calmat, meanwhile, contends that in 1987 it had been involved in Poway for only 
a year and that when it heard of the neighbors' complaints, it complied 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that we have to meet our commitments and live with our 
neighbors," said Severo Chavez, assistant manager of Calmat's San Diego region. 
"We operate in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
"We will be actively participating with the community for the entire time we're 
there," Imler said. "That's the only way we know how to operate." 
</P>
<P>
The Poway facility has 50 employees, and, although the operation would double 
in size, Imler said that only about a dozen new workers would be hired under 
the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The area is rich with valuable minerals found in gravel, cement and asphalt and 
vital to buildings and roads. 
</P>
<P>
"All the south Poway area is identified as a mineral resource zone by the state 
Department of Conservation," said Steve Streeter, assistant planning director 
for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Mineral deposits are where they're at," Imler said. "We have to operate where 
the deposits are, and (south Poway) happens to be one of the better deposits in 
San Diego County and one of the few remaining ones." 
</P>
<P>
Calmat operates similar mining and asphalt facilities in Pala, Mission Valley 
and Carroll Canyon on Black Mountain Road. 
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, Calmat has paid $2,000 in fines for three minor permit 
violations of air pollution rules, according to the county Air Pollution 
Control District. A public nuisance violation regarding the Carroll Canyon site 
is pending.

2 MORE JAILBREAK FUGITIVES ARE CAUGHT BY POLICE; 
</P>
<P>
ESCAPE: COUNTY OFFICIALS SEEK FUNDING TO TIGHTEN SECURITY AS NINE INMATES FROM 
CHULA VISTA JAIL REMAIN AT LARGE. 
</P>

<P>
Two more of the 13 inmates who fled the County Jail in Chula Vista in the 
county's biggest jailbreak were recaptured Friday. Meanwhile, county and 
Sheriff's Department officials took steps to patch security leaks in 
problem-plagued county jails. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests of Carlos Renteria, 27, and Michael Walker, 29, along with the 
capture of two inmates shortly after their escape Wednesday, leaves nine 
inmates at large, according to Deputy Robbie Hill, a Sheriff's Department 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The escapees considered to be the most dangerous -- three of whom are suspected 
of murder -- are still being sought, Hill added. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department has taken several steps to recapture the inmates, 
including notifying Mexican authorities, assigning special officers, and 
informing law enforcement agencies nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, Supervisor Brian Bilbray drafted a proposal asking the county 
Board of Supervisors to immediately allocate funds to secure the windows at the 
South Bay jail. The proposal, which is expected to be addressed by the board 
Tuesday, also asks the Sheriff's Department to identify and evaluate other 
security deficiencies at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Board Chairman Leon Williams drafted a proposal asking county and 
Sheriff's Department officials to conduct a comprehensive security review of 
all county jails. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday evening, the 13 inmates escaped from the jail by sawing through 
steel bars with hacksaws smuggled in through an open window, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The men escaped about 8:45 p.m. by sawing through two bars -- each about 5 
inches deep, 1.5 inches wide and 2 feet tall -- and then using the bars to 
smash through a window. Sheriff's Capt. Chuck Wood, who runs the South Bay 
jail, said alarms installed on the windows when the jail was built in 1982 are 
no longer operative. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, 29 -- accused of possessing stolen property -- was recaptured by San 
Diego police officers shortly before 3 a.m. Friday, when an anonymous caller 
informed authorities that Walker was driving a gray Ford Mustang with a missing 
left taillight. Police found Walker at 4th Avenue and Juniper Street and 
arrested him without incident, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Renteria, 27 -- jailed on suspicion of robbery -- was recaptured by San 
Diego police in Encanto about 11 a.m. Friday, when officers responded to a call 
about a burglary in progress in the 6100 block of Brooklyn Avenue. Two police 
officers suffered minor injuries while trying to apprehend Renteria, who 
resisted arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department officials said that Christopher Bell, 21, is considered 
the most dangerous of the nine men still at large. Bell is charged with robbery 
and assault and is considered the key suspect in the October slaying of a La 
Mesa man who was kidnaped at a bank automatic teller machine and slain 
execution style. Bell was being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the jailbreak, an angry Wood blamed the incident on 
overcrowded conditions and the failure of the county government to respond to 
requests for improvements in the facility's security system. 
</P>
<P>
Although disturbed that his requests for expensive detection cameras and 
sophisticated alarms had been shunned because of the county's fiscal woes, Wood 
seemed particularly distressed about the county General Services Department's 
failure to put grating or wire mesh on the outside of the jail's windows. 
</P>
<P>
In hindsight, officials agree, that simple preventive measure could have foiled 
the jailbreak. An investigation by authorities has determined that somebody 
lowered the hacksaws by rope to the inmates from a public walkway 15 feet above 
one of the jail's unattended windows. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the poorly constructed County Jail in El Cajon that is riddled with 
problems -- inmates have been able to escape from that facility by kicking 
holes through the walls -- authorities say the South Bay facility is well built 
and fairly secure. Therefore, without the hacksaws, authorities say, the 
inmates could not have escaped. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Griego, who, as the county's deputy chief administrative officer, 
oversees the general services department, denied that his department was to 
blame. He said the department simply lacked the funds to carry out jail 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
More important, Griego said, the lack of wire mesh was never described to his 
department as a security problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a tour of the facility and when I talked to Captain Wood the main thing 
he was disturbed about was the pigeon droppings that were accumulating outside 
the windows," Griego said. "Apparently that was a health risk, so he asked me 
to put (wire mesh) up to keep the pigeons out. He never told me it was needed 
to tighten up security." 
</P>
<P>
In December, a financially strapped general services department forwarded 
Wood's request for window mesh, alarms and security cameras to a special county 
committee with the authority to distribute money earmarked for justice facility 
improvements, Griego said. 
</P>
<P>
"Stopping pigeon pooping wasn't considered a high priority, so the request was 
rejected," Griego said. "If it was identified as a needed security measure, if 
it was really dramatized, maybe we could have tried harder to get the money." 
</P>
<P>
But David Janssen, the county's deputy chief administrative officer, said the 
request still would have been denied. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't have mattered because we didn't have any money left anyway," said 
Janssen referring to a $3.9-million fund of local fines and forfeitures that 
state law requires be set aside for improvement of justice facilities. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Wood declined to say whether he told general services staff that the 
lack of wire mesh posed a security risk. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no point debating this in the press," Wood said. "I am not going to 
engage in any finger-pointing. That's not important. My intent is to address 
these security issues with a spirit of cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm getting a very, very satisfactory response (from county officials)," 
Wood said. "We're looking at everything from fences to television cameras to 
motion sensors. . . . We are looking at everything that can help alleviate this 
from ever happening again." Wood said the windows will be made inaccessible to 
the inmates immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"I had 14 people escape. . . . I was very sensitive to that. . . . I was very 
upset," said Wood about comments he made at the press conference implying that 
the county had ignored his requests. "Sometimes I put in work orders, and 
sometimes I talk with people in high places (to get things accomplished). You 
wait for a response but you realize these people can't promise you anything." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department officials initially reported that 14 inmates had escaped, 
but that count was revised to 13 after jail officials determined that 
Christopher Brown, charged with violating probation, had never left the jail. 
</P>
<P>
County and Sheriff's Department officials -- who, in the past, have often 
blamed each other for the jail woes -- curbed criticism and instead expressed 
frustration over the lack of solutions to solve the county's jail problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Our jails are at 183% capacity," said Asst. Sheriff Ken Wigginton, who 
oversees the county's detention facilities. "We have 1,900 inmates more than we 
have rated beds for. The county has a real serious money problem. I don't know 
how we're going to solve this." 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray added: "We just don't have the money to take comprehensive preventive 
measures. Right now, we're looking at each weak link in the system as it 
appears and are trying to make sure that no weak link is exploited twice by a 
prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
"Keep in mind that (South Bay) is one of our better facilities," Bilbray added. 
"But they found the Achilles heel and they got outside help." 
</P>
<P>
The escapees used bed sheets to lower themselves 40 feet to the ground. Jail 
officials were not aware of the escape until a passer-by called 911 after 
seeing inmates getting in a car outside the jail. Two of the inmates were 
quickly recaptured. 
</P>
<P>
The jail has a staff of 53 deputies, but no more than a dozen are on duty at 
night. Understaffing prevents deputies from standing guard outside the jail 
around the clock, Wigginton said. But he added that deputies patrol the jail 
grounds about four times per 12-hour shift. The Chula Vista jail is built to 
house 192 inmates but contains more than 750.

UCSD CO-OP DISPUTE DEADLOCK CONTINUES; 
</P>
<P>
UNIVERSITY: STUDENTS FEAR THEY'LL LOSE CONTROL OF STORES IF UCSD OWNS THE 
LOCKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The students who run the co-operative stores at UC San Diego refused Friday to 
sign a lease proposed by the university administration, saying that to give in 
would lead to further university control over the co-ops. 
</P>
<P>
The decision came after a meeting among the students Thursday night at the 
Groundwork, a co-op bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict arises over who should own the locks on the co-ops. The 
administration wants to issue keys to students running the stores and to keep a 
set of keys for emergency, safety and health reasons. The students do not 
oppose the administration having keys, but they feel they should own the locks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more symbolic than anything else," said Jason Carbone, chairman of the 
University Center Board, which has been acting as mediator in the lease 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not about these locks going on doors, it's about what kind of active 
participation does the university want to take place with the co-ops and how 
much interaction does the co-op want with the university," Carbone said, adding 
that the co-ops want more autonomy from the administration. 
</P>
<P>
Students fear that university control over the locks, while making no 
short-term changes in existing operations, may in the long run lead to more 
university control, said Paul Eykamp of the UCB. 
</P>
<P>
The UCB, a committee of students that advises the vice chancellor on issues 
concerning the center, had drawn up a lease agreement that was rebuffed by the 
administration. The administration then returned with its proposal, Carbone 
said, adding that the locks is the only issue preventing the three-year lease 
from being signed. 
</P>
<P>
"If the administration goes through with this and ignores the UCB and co-ops 
which represent the students, then the administration is setting a precedent of 
ignoring student input," said Tony Smith of the Che Cafe co-op. 
</P>
<P>
"In view of all the developments of world democracy, I think it's a disgrace." 
</P>
<P>
University officials said they will not be evicting any of the four student-run 
businesses, but will begin changing co-op locks to university locks which have 
have keys that can't be duplicated. 
</P>
<P>
"The co-ops are entities of the university with tremendous amounts of autonomy, 
but the reality is that they are student organizations and the university has 
some responsibilities," said Jim Carruthers, the director of the University 
Center and in charge of approving leases. 
</P>
<P>
"They are university buildings first, and they are no different than any other 
university facility," Carruthers said, pointing out that every other building 
is secured with university locks. 
</P>
<P>
But Eykamp said the center is different because it was built from funds raised 
through student fees, and as such the center should come under student control. 
</P>
<P>
The co-ops put their own locks on the doors in 1980 when a campus security 
officer was allegedly found in one of the co-ops with the cashbox. Carruthers 
said that the co-op locks are illegal and must be removed. 
</P>
<P>
The students, however, are determined not to let the locks be changed. 
</P>
<P>
"The Food Co-op, the Groundwork and Che Cafe are all going to be open for the 
next 72 hours to prevent them from being changed," said Heidi Mitchem, who 
works at Che Cafe. There will also be a midnight vigil today at Che Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
"When they decide to change keys, hopefully we will be here and we will be able 
to stop them," Mitchem said. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, said the administration will wait until students have left for 
spring break or the summer to change the locks.

SAKHAROV SQUARE?; 
</P>
<P>
CATERING TO FOES OF CHANGING A STREET NAME, WACHS' PROPOSAL WOULD HONOR SOVIET 
WITH AN INTERSECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Hoping to avoid merchant opposition that doomed an earlier effort to honor 
Soviet human-rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, two Los Angeles city 
councilmen on Friday proposed naming a major Studio City intersection after the 
late Nobel Peace Prize winner. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the intersection of Laurel Canyon and Ventura boulevards would 
be designated "Andrei Sakharov Square." 
</P>
<P>
An earlier proposal to rename nearby Ventura Place after Sakharov ran into 
fierce opposition from merchants, who complained that some customers would be 
unable to find the renamed street and that they would have to change stationery 
and advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joel Wachs, who authored the Ventura Place proposal, on Friday was 
joined by Councilman Michael Woo in proposing the designation for the 
intersection, which splits the two council districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The southeast corner of the same intersection was the scene of a lively 
dispute last year when neighbors tried to prevent a developer from tearing down 
a coffee shop and a carwash for replacement with a mini-mall. The protesters 
tried unsuccessfully to save the carwash by arguing that it was a historically 
important cultural monument to 1950s architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides of that dispute said Friday that they favor the Sakharov proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Jack McGrath, a Studio City activist who led the unsuccessful campaign to save 
the carwash, said the idea "has merit." He added, however, that "maybe we 
should have some sort of election to see if residents agree with it." 
</P>
<P>
His opponent in the carwash dispute, developer Ira Handelman, called the 
proposal "commendable, and we're all for it. . . . We think it's honoring a 
great man." 
</P>
<P>
The Wachs-Woo motion directed the city Bureau of Engineering to erect signs 
indicating that the intersection has been named for Sakharov. But no part of 
either boulevard would be renamed. 
</P>
<P>
"This way, no business will have to change any letterheads or anything, so we 
hope there won't be any opposition," said Gail Koretz, a Wachs aide. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which was referred to the council's Public Works Committee, must 
be approved by the full council. 
</P>
<P>
Although the new proposal may mollify merchants, the location of the proposed 
Sakharov memorial is opposed by John Nelson, owner of a Texaco gas station on 
Ventura Boulevard, who is on the board of directors of the Studio City Chamber 
of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson favors honoring Sakharov by giving his name to a small, triangular 
traffic island at Ventura Place and Ventura Boulevard, just a block east of the 
intersection chosen by Wachs and Woo. Ventura Place runs diagonally for one 
block between Laurel Canyon Boulevard on the west and Ventura Boulevard on the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said the chamber's board suggested naming the island for Sakharov in a 
letter sent to Wachs about a month ago. Wachs said Friday night that he knows 
of no such proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said the island, now home to five palm trees and a sundial, is to be 
renovated anyway. It will receive brickwork and a flagpole in a project 
financed by $45,000 that Ventura Boulevard merchants donated years ago to 
beautify the street divider. Work is scheduled to begin in less than two weeks, 
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs said he knows of only one other intersection in the city named after a 
person -- Raoul Wallenberg Square, dedicated to the Swedish diplomat who 
disappeared in the Soviet Union after helping European Jews escape the Nazis. 
The square is at Beverly Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs said that Sakharov, who died Dec. 14, 1989, at age 68, "was widely known 
as the conscience of Soviet society" who spoke out vigorously against 
repression in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Manochehr Bajoul, who owns Studio Carpet on Ventura Place, fought against the 
original proposal to name that street for Sakharov but is all for Wachs' second 
proposal. "Today, we are putting one Russian in our neighborhood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow, maybe they'll put the name of one American over there. Who knows?" 
</P>

AUTHOR OF REPORT CRITICIZING SDG&amp;E MERGER LEAVES PUC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Terry L. Murray, who recently directed a Public Utilities Commission staff 
report that criticized San Diego Gas &amp; Electric's proposed merger with 
Southern California Edison, is leaving the state agency to join an 
Oakland-based consulting firm, PUC officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Morse, Richard, Weisenmiller &amp; Associates, the firm that Murray will join, 
is under contract to the city of San Diego, which is opposing the merger. 
</P>
<P>
At the PUC, Murray served as director of the Division of Ratepayer Advocates. 
The city of San Diego strongly supported the division's recent report, which 
suggests that the merger would not prove beneficial to customers of either 
utility. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at SGD&amp;E and Edison on Friday declined to comment on Murray's 
departure. In a prepared release, PUC Executive Director Neal Shulman said 
Murray was making the move to be "closer to where she lives in order to handle 
an unexpected family health emergency."

DEPUTY ASSOCIATION'S BACKING OF DROWN SEEN AS KEY ENDORSEMENT IN SHERIFF RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a key endorsement, the San Diego County Deputy Sheriffs' Assn. on Friday 
pledged its support for Jack Drown in his bid to succeed longtime Sheriff John 
Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
The endorsement, announced at the association's Mira Mesa headquarters, was 
made after a survey of the 1,200 members of the labor organization showed 
overwhelming support for Drown, and the group's board of directors voted 
unanimously to back Drown in this year's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The support is viewed as a key endorsement because the association represents 
about 92% of the sworn members of the Sheriff's Department, and their lead will 
likely be followed by other area law enforcement groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack has worked his way through the ranks of the department to his current 
position (as assistant sheriff) and throughout his career has shown that he has 
the skills to fill his post," said Skip Murphy, DSA president. 
</P>
<P>
"He has also shown that he has not forgotten the problems of doing the job or 
the problems facing the individual doing that job." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy denied a charge that the endorsement was influenced by Duffy, who 
dropped out of the race late last year and then threw his support to Drown. 
"That comment was totally without foundation and was totally false," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And Murphy dismissed any contentions that, if elected, Drown would simply 
represent a continuation of the 20-year Duffy administration. 
</P>
<P>
"They are different personalities," he said. "They have different management 
styles, and I have personally observed issues where they have disagreed, 
sometimes very strongly. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack is loyal to his department and therefore loyal to the sheriff, and there 
is nothing improper with that. But Jack Drown is not a John Duffy clone." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache, the only other candidate who is a sworn member of 
the Sheriff's Department, said Friday that the association's endorsement of 
Drown was certain from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I was concerned, this decision was DOA: Drown On Arrival," he said. 
"I previously indicated that internal pressures and lobbying was under way to 
ensure that Drown would win the endorsement, so I'm not surprised by the 
result." 
</P>
<P>
He conceded, however, that association support "probably will be beneficial" 
for Drown. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an important organizational endorsement," Roache said. "All other law 
enforcement agencies will take the lead of the Deputy Sheriffs' Assn. Now, how 
much value that will be in the public's mind, we'll just have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates are Vincent Jimno, who is on leave as chief of police in 
Escondido, and Ray Hoobler, former police chief in San Diego.

NEED FOR SENIORS HOUSING MAY OVERRIDE 'NUISANCES,' HIDDEN HILLS PLANNERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed lower-cost apartment building for senior citizens in Hidden Hills 
may not be compatible with a five-story office building that would be built 
next to it, according to an environmental-impact report the city released 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But the environmental report, prepared by the city's planning staff, also 
states that the area's lack of lower-cost housing may be a more important 
consideration for the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The report was released a day after a Los Angeles Superior Court judge told 
Hidden Hills officials that he is prepared to order them into court to approve 
the lower-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that the proposed 75,000-square-foot office building and 
its about 250 employees could cause "nuisances" for the about 100 residents of 
the senior complex. 
</P>
<P>
"Office-related traffic, trash pickup and other common activities found at 
office sites are likely to disturb the peace and quiet of the apartment site, 
which has no outdoor recreational facilities," the report states. 
</P>
<P>
"In addition, the large height and bulk of the proposed office building is 
likely to cast extensive shadows onto the apartment building and present an 
imposing mass which 'closes in' the apartment building," the report continues. 
</P>
<P>
But, the report adds: "The availability of affordably priced housing may be 
more important, however, to local households with limited incomes and presently 
undesirable living conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Hidden Hills has no multifamily housing, and the average home price in 1988 in 
the city was $843,579, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The parts of the report that criticize the senior housing are likely to provide 
opponents of the project with ammunition. Earlier this week, some of the nearly 
50 residents who attended a City Council meeting complained about the size of 
the commercial building. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental report also provides more details about the entire 25-acre 
proposal by Tarzana developer Danny Howard. On 21 acres inside Hidden Hills' 
gates, Howard would build nine hilltop-style luxury homes. The remaining 4 
acres would be outside the gates and would accommodate the five-story 
commercial building and a four-story apartment building containing 48 units. 
</P>
<P>
The 48 apartments would consist of four efficiencies, 35 one-bedroom units, 
eight two-bedroom units and a manager's apartment, the report states. A scale 
for rents has yet to be determined, it adds. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is considering the project as a result of the settlement of a 
lawsuit filed against it by Los Angeles County in 1984. The lawsuit concerned 
the city's use of a redevelopment agency to fund a flood-control project and a 
state law requiring a part of redevelopment money to be spent on lower-cost 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Judge R. William Schoettler Jr. told Hidden Hills officials that 
the city must abide by the July, 1989, settlement, which took the form of a 
court order that Hidden Hills provide lower-cost housing on the Howard 
property.

FREEWAY AND RAIL LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With regard to a Times article of Feb. 7 about an advisory vote by Valley 
residents for a choice of a continuation of the Metro Rail line, let's get a 
few facts straight. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura Freeway opened in 1960. It does not have sound walls, even though 
before 1987 it was considered the most heavily traveled freeway in the world.

Drive it now, and it feels like you have a flat tire. Cement loses some of its 
strength over years, especially when tons of weight are placed upon it second 
by second. Trying to put up a monorail or heavy rail line along the Ventura 
Freeway is just inviting another Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
I moved into my home in 1966, when freeway noise was minimal -- but then so was 
Burbank Airport noise, which goes right over my home. 
</P>
<P>
An official of Caltrans promised me, prior to my moving into my home, that a 
sound wall would be put up along the Ventura Freeway by the end of 1968. 
Unfortunately, that person now is retired and no longer a state employee. 
</P>
<P>
We handful of naysayers -- the Coalition of Freeway Homeowners and those 
members of churches and synagogues along Chandler Boulevard -- are not against 
mass rapid transit, but we know what we were promised, and we know the 
bureaucracy is not to be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Deane Dana wants an advisory vote. Is he willing to pay for it? Who 
is doing this advising? Not one person on the City Council's Citizen Advisory 
Committee lives along any of the proposed routes. How come? Don't they want to 
put up with the dirt, dust, noise and nighttime construction? 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that is acceptable is a subway. Or let's get some bus service 
first here in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
There is only one Metro Rail route for the Valley -- a 50- to 75-foot-deep 
subway along Ventura Boulevard, where all the offices could be served.

MEETING MEDICAL NEEDS OF REFUGEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nem Norn is almost always tired. A refugee from Cambodia, Norn, 53, saw two of 
his children killed by the communist Khmer Rouge before he fled to the United 
States five years ago. Today he shares a small apartment in Long Beach with his 
wife and four surviving children where, suspecting that his constant state of 
exhaustion stems from the longstanding depression of his past, he struggles 
through his days with little help. 
</P>
<P>
Yoth Yoeung, 45, has a lump in her throat. Once she went to a doctor, but the 
doctor could not speak her language. So Yoeung, also a Cambodian refugee, does 
the best she can without much comprehension. "I never understand what the 
doctor says," she explained through an interpreter who recently visited her 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
That interpreter was part of a new program that already has served about 350 
elderly Southeast Asians in Long Beach, either by luring them to health 
education classes or by providing translators for their appointments with 
doctors. Sponsored by St. Mary Medical Center and United Cambodian Community 
Inc., its aim is to reach Southeast Asians 45 and older, particularly Cambodian 
refugees, whose language barriers, cultural values, fear or general alienation 
often prevent them from seeking or using much-needed medical care. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an uphill battle," said Lillian Lew, project director, "but I'm sure that 
we can make an impact on this community." 
</P>
<P>
In the seven months since the program began, she said, it has sent teams of 
bilingual health workers door to door in central-city apartment complexes known 
to be inhabited by large numbers of Southeast Asians. The teams also have been 
stationed at a local Cambodian Buddhist temple where many elderly Cambodians 
spend much of their time. 
</P>
<P>
The service is delivered in two basic ways, Lew said. First, health workers 
introduce themselves, distribute leaflets bearing the program's telephone 
number and interview people regarding the general state of their health. And 
second, she said, they organize "health fairs" at the temple or in the 
apartment complexes to provide health education and such basic health-care 
screening as blood pressure checks, diabetes tests and vision exams. 
</P>
<P>
When health problems are discovered, Lew said, project workers make 
appointments for the refugees with doctors of their choice or at St. Mary. If 
necessary, she said, they even provide transportation to the doctor's office 
and may act as interpreters during the appointments. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Lew said, she hopes to expand the program into Asian markets where 
health workers will give lectures on nutrition and provide demonstrations on 
healthful methods of cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Diet is a key reason for the program, according to Lew, a Chinese-American who 
is a registered dietitian with degrees in sociology and cross-cultural 
education. Among other things, she said, traditional Southeast Asian culture 
encourages the consumption of fatty meats, which contributes to a high 
incidence of strokes and cardiovascular disease; pickled or fermented foods, 
which doctors suspect of causing stomach cancer, and foods high in sodium, 
which contributes to hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the refugees' general health problems were made worse by their 
experiences under Pol Pot, when food was scarce, and by life in refugee camps, 
where conditions were primitive. 
</P>
<P>
Although no data exists on the health status of Southeast Asian refugees, Lew 
said, they seem to suffer from high rates of hepatitis B, perhaps caused by 
unsanitary living conditions; malnutrition, which is probably a result of the 
war years, and diabetes, which may be diet or stress-related. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, many older Cambodians suffer from serious mental health 
problems, resulting both from the trauma of their past experiences and their 
current difficulties in adapting to a new culture. 
</P>
<P>
One of the goals of the new health project, Lew said, is to collect some of the 
missing data on the health needs of older Southeast Asians. The task is 
difficult because they are wary, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Southeast Asians have a different world health view," Lew said. "They have 
their own underground health culture." 
</P>
<P>
Among the features of that culture is the perception of a hospital as a place 
one goes only to die. Having come from a society in which medical techniques 
are an average of 30 years behind those in the United States, Lew said, many 
refugees utilize herbal cures, spiritual healing or over-the-counter medicines 
rather than seek the advice of trained physicians. 
</P>
<P>
It was to help provide alternatives to those practices that the FHP Foundation 
-- a Long Beach-based organization dedicated to supporting health-care 
education, research and services -- recently awarded a $140,000 grant to the 
Southeast Asian Health Project that runs the new program. The money is being 
used, Lew said, for printed materials, health fair personnel, and to pay the 
salaries of the teams of bilingual health workers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the refugees encountered during a recent visit to their apartment 
complex seemed to appreciate the personal attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy if someone comes to knock at my door," said Lach Kheng, 57, 
who, speaking through the interpreter, had complained of "hot" feelings inside 
his stomach. "It's a help. I don't know where to go or what to do. At least now 
I can discuss it."

In some editions of Saturday View last week, part of the directions in the Day 
Hike column were omitted. 
</P>
<P>
The correct directions are: 
</P>
<P>
The Hike: From the end of Mel Canyon Road, follow the unsigned footpath up the 
brushy slope. The trail briefly joins a road and continues ascending to a fire 
department helipad. 
</P>
<P>
Continue on the trail, a short way past the helipad to an unsigned junction, 
where the trail joins Van Tassel Fire Road. You'll hike around a locked gate 
and begin some steep switchbacks. The dirt road climbs to a ridgeline and takes 
you past big cone spruce, which frame views of San Gabriel peaks. Enjoy the 
panorama from 3,720 Mt. Bliss; return same way.

16 O.C. CITIES RUNNING AFOUL OF HOUSING RULES; 
</P>
<P>
REGULATIONS: MORE THAN HALF OF THE COUNTY'S CITIES HAVE PLANS THAT FAIL TO 
COMPLY WITH STATE STANDARDS. ENVIRONMENTALISTS SEE A POTENT TOOL TO HALT 
PROJECTS.

<P>
More than half of Orange County's 29 cities have local housing plans that fail 
to comply with state standards and could face legal problems such as those that 
barred Seal Beach this week from issuing any new residential building permits, 
state officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, opponents of a 329-unit development in northwest Seal Beach gained 
a court order preventing the city from granting permits until the city updates 
and adopts its state-required housing plan. 
</P>
<P>
While the ruling applies only in Seal Beach, environmentalists said the legal 
battle highlights a potent new tool to fight developments in cities whose 
housing plans fail to meet state standards. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, this will set a trend," said Galen Ambrose, vice president of the 
Wetlands Restoration Society, which filed the lawsuit against Seal Beach. "I 
expect all the cities now will be scrambling to adopt their new plans." 
</P>
<P>
State officials agreed that other cities could face similar challenges. "This 
could certainly happen to any city that has not updated their plan," said 
William Murphy, assistant chief of housing policy development for the state 
Department of Housing and Community Development. 
</P>
<P>
"Any city that ignores the regulation will be vulnerable to similar court 
action and to the same kind of decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires cities every five years to update their local housing plan, 
known technically as the "housing element" of the city's general plan for 
commercial and residential construction. In the plan, cities assess current 
housing and show that their officials are planning to accommodate future 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, 16 cities either failed to submit housing plans by last 
summer's deadline or turned in plans that did not include adequate strategies 
for dealing with such issues as low-income housing, said Murphy, whose 
department reviews the plans. 
</P>
<P>
The jurisdictions with approved housing plans are Anaheim, Costa Mesa, Santa 
Ana, Newport Beach, Placentia, San Clemente and Tustin. Dana Point and Mission 
Viejo, plus the county. Newly incorporated cities whose housing plans are not 
yet due are Dana Point, Mission Viejo and Laguna Niguel. Under review are plans 
for Orange, Huntington Beach and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
These plans must be submitted to the state according to a state-mandated 
timetable, although no government agency has the authority to force a city to 
comply with the housing requirement. Private citizens, however, can take legal 
action to force compliance. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no authority to take action against a city for not updating their 
housing element," said Travis Pitts, deputy director of the state Department of 
Housing and Community Development. "Private citizens can sue the city for 
non-compliance. That's about the only way to enforce this law." 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach officials say their housing plan will not be in compliance until at 
least late April, when the City Council hopes to adopt a new plan. 
</P>
<P>
For Seal Beach resident and developer Henry A. Ericksen, 76, the ruling has hit 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working eight months getting ready to apply for this permit," said 
Ericksen, who sought permission to build two homes Thursday afternoon, just 
hours after the city stopped granting permits. "I've spent $30,000 so far, and 
now it'll cost me $1,500 a week just to wait. I'm sitting here with bare land 
and 10% interest. It's not very pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
According to Seal Beach Planning Director Lee Whittenberg, Ericksen is the only 
permit applicant the city has turned away so far. Officials stressed, however, 
that the ruling came down only this week and details of enforcement are not 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
The city has temporarily suspended issuing new permits while awaiting a more 
detailed ruling on whether each kind of residential building permit would be 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say keeping a housing plan up to date is difficult because the 
process requires a lot of staff time. In addition, state goals, such as making 
sure there is enough apartment housing for low-income residents, sometimes 
conflict with the sentiments of residents who oppose high-density housing. 
</P>
<P>
"The growth-control sentiment is part of the problem," Murphy said. "Everyone 
seems to have a NIMBY attitude (about high-density housing) -- 'not in my back 
yard.' " 
</P>
<P>
In Fullerton, the City Council adopted a housing plan over the objections of 
state officials who said the plan did not include a time line showing how the 
city will include housing programs for low-income residents. The city decided 
it would be a waste of time to submit a revised plan to the state, said Joel 
Rosen, a Fullerton senior planner. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that we are substantively and substantially in compliance with state 
law, and, if challenged, we feel we could win on this issue," Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
Holly Hamlin, associate planner for Cypress, said she is more concerned with 
preparing a proper housing plan than with meeting the state's deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing to us is we do it right, that we adopt a housing 
element that satisfies state law and meets the needs of the people of Cypress," 
she said, adding that a consultant is working on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of various county cities said they realize that operating without a 
current housing plan is legally questionable, but they also said some smaller 
cities cannot afford the expense of updating one. 
</P>
<P>
"The state says, 'Gee, we're going to pass all these laws,' and then they don't 
say how they expect us to comply," said Whittenberg of Seal Beach. "Small 
cities like Seal Beach don't have the resources to do everything." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Knight, director of community development for Dana Point and former planning 
director in Seal Beach, said he is not surprised that Seal Beach was sued. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason so many general plans are out of date is that it takes so much 
money to keep them updated," Knight said. "There's probably no general plan in 
the state of California that is adequate." 
</P>
<P>
In Stanton, Planning Manager Mike Bouvier said his city's housing plan was 
neglected "because whoever was in charge at the time didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, we recognize the legal ramifications," Bouvier said, adding that 
Stanton's general plan is being rewritten. "It is just one of the risks all 
cities have to take." 
</P>
<P>
However, state officials said cities have had ample notice that housing plans 
must be submitted every five years and should be able to comply. "We'd 
certainly like to direct attention to this problem, because we think it's a big 
one," Murphy said. "Since there's not direct enforcement, the enforcement of 
the plan depends on public attention."

Besides Seal Beach, 15 other Orange County cities could face the same problem

O.C. ORDERED TO PAY RETIREES FOR INSURANCE 
</P>

<P>
A Superior Court judge Friday ordered Orange County to pay what could amount to 
$50 million to thousands of retired county workers who were forced to pay more 
for their medical insurance after the county stopped contributing to the 
coverage in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The decision caps a five-year legal battle between the county and the Orange 
County Employees Assn., which argued that discontinuing medical insurance 
contributions violated gov 
</P>
<P>
ernment regulations. 
</P>
<P>
County officials reached Friday declined to comment on the judgment, saying 
they had not yet seen the ruling. A private attorney represented the county in 
the case and he could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In his 15-page ruling, Judge Claude M. Owens agreed with the association and 
ordered the Board of Supervisors to pay back the retirees and approve "a health 
benefit plan or plans that comply with the provisions" of government codes. 
</P>
<P>
Owens said the exact amount of the refund, the number of people affected by the 
ruling and the method of paying the refunds must still be decided before any 
money is received by retirees. The attorney for the employees association said 
up to 46,000 retirees could be affected. 
</P>
<P>
If the association and county cannot agree on a new benefit plan or on payment 
of damages, the matter will go before the court again for another hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Richard S. Rockwell, attorney for the employees association, hailed the ruling 
as significant because other counties in the state have also discontinued 
insurance payments on behalf of retirees. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell also said Orange County's decision to halt payments for retirees 
forced some of them to go without insurance because they could not make the 
payments. "There were people being cut loose," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The case hinged on the interpretation of an obscure Government Code section 
dealing with medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Association attorneys argued that the statute required that counties offer the 
same coverage to retirees as it does to current employees. 
</P>
<P>
Owens agreed with the association, saying it is the board's duty "to approve 
health benefits plans that have the same coverage for retirees that is 
available to active county employees and at no increase in cost to retirees 
over the cost to active employees." 
</P>
<P>
Owens rejected arguments forwarded by the county's attorneys that portions of 
the statute are "permissive" and that the meaning of certain key phrases in the 
code are unclear. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly 11 years, Orange County paid all or part of health insurance 
premiums for retired county employees. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1979, the Board of Supervisors voted to stop making payments, agreeing 
with a staff recommendation that the payments were "not an effective 
expenditure of benefit dollars," according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the time said county contributions, which amounted to between $22 
and $44 per retiree, were "not a vested right but rather (are) subject to the 
annual discretion" of the county. 
</P>
<P>
They also noted that county employees "have a stronger and more beneficial 
retirement program than most private sector retirees" even without the medical 
insurance contributions. 
</P>
<P>
County Counsel Adrian Kuyper said a private attorney handled the case because 
of the possible conflict of interest that could arise with county employees 
handling a case that deals with their own health benefits. He identified that 
attorney as Santa Ana lawyer Ken Smart. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known what action the county would take next or whether an appeal 
was likely. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, contacted at home, had not been informed of the 
judge's decision, but he acknowledged that the ruling could be a blow to the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, $50 million is one tremendous liability," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Owens said in his ruling that estimates varied as to how much the county owed 
retirees, noting that figures as low as $12 million and as high as $50 million 
were used in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
However, the judge rejected the county's contention that the expense involved 
in paying the retirees should exempt the county from having to make a full 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
"Although this argument would evoke considerable sympathy in the hearts of many 
taxpayers, the law bars such consideration as an excuse for non-compliance with 
the law," Owens stated in his ruling.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; 
</P>
<P>
SHOPPING CENTER TO OPEN DOORS DEC. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opening day for La Habra Marketplace will be Dec. 1, the center's development 
company announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
The mall's major tenant will be Service Merchandise, a catalogue department 
store that will occupy nearly one-fourth of the center, said Jeffrey B. Armour, 
senior development manager and partner with the Hopkins Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
About 40% of the shopping center is leased, Armour said. Ross Dress for Less 
has leased 26,000 square feet, and one or two more major tenants are being 
sought, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The center is being built on the western end of what was previously known as 
the Fashion Square Mall. Demolition of old buildings on the site has already 
begun. However, the Buffums building will remain for two months until asbestos 
in the building can be removed, Armour said.

The principal of El Dorado High School will allow the school's drama students 
to perform an edited version of a play about a young woman with cerebral palsy, 
reversing a decision he made earlier this week banning the production. 
</P>
<P>
But Principal Richard Bernier said the decision to allow the play, "They Dance 
Real Slow in Jackson," should not be interpreted as a move toward "more lenient 
policy on school plays." 
</P>
<P>
"The final editing right shall be mine," Bernier said. "I certainly will 
continue to push for more family-type plays." 
</P>
<P>
Bernier first objected to the play because of its sexual innuendoes and 
profanity. He decided to allow the play only after making changes in the script 
to eliminate some of the harsh language and explicit scenes. Drama teacher Gai 
Jones said the changes do not take away from the play's message. 
</P>
<P>
And both Bernier and the drama students, who supported the original version of 
the play, said the incident has helped improve campus relations. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll always have conflicting ideas," Jones said. "But at least we can 
be negotiable so that in the future it won't have to reach the levels it did 
this time." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Melissa Frydman, who spearheaded the student campaign to preserve the 
original version of the play, said: "I'm really pleased that Mr. Bernier 
listened to us. . . . I hope it means that he won't come out again and flat-out 
say no." 
</P>
<P>
Problems arose Monday when Bernier said he had not read the entire play but had 
decided to ban it and would not consider reading an edited version. LISA

BOND SALE APPROVED FOR RECYCLING GEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council this week unanimously approved the sale of $2.6 million in 
bonds to pay for new equipment for the city recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
The Placentia Disposal Co. will use the money to buy new equipment for the 
recycling program scheduled to begin in July, City Administrator Robert D'Amato 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The money will be repaid through garbage collection fees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"By financing the equipment ourselves, we were able to save as much as 50 cents 
per household," said D'Amato, adding that city financing at an interest rate of 
7.5% is cheaper than the bank rate of about 12%. 
</P>
<P>
The equipment will include a mechanical arm that picks up curbside trash bins 
containing recyclables. 
</P>
<P>
"The city will share in the profits from the recycled goods and will have a 
share in getting top dollar for recyclables," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The firm of Stradling Yocca Carlson &amp; Rauth was chosen to act as bond 
counsel, with the firm of Seidler-Fitzgerald Public Finance acting as 
investment banker. -- JULIE ESPY

LATIN TO BE TAUGHT AT MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA MICHAELIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To give high school Latin students a head start, the Orange Unified School 
District this week unanimously approved teaching the language at the middle 
school level. 
</P>
<P>
For the last year, Latin has been taught before regular classes begin at El 
Rancho Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
The program will now be expanded for students at all five of the district's 
middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
High school officials wanted first-year Latin taught to students earlier so 
they could be eligible to take advanced placement courses for college credit by 
their senior year, said Tom Schrodi, director of instructional services for the 
district. French and Spanish are already offered at the middle-school level. 
</P>
<P>
Latin courses are popular with students and parents, Canyon Principal Jack Fox 
said, largely because of their application to modern languages like French and 
Spanish. Latin also "teaches good discipline," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents really went for it," Fox said. "I think also, for kids who are 
taking SATs, the Latin really helps." 
</P>
<P>
After pre-registration for the middle school courses, the district will 
evaluate whether or not additional teachers are needed. LAURA MICHAELIS

EX-DEPUTY CHARGED ON 2 SEX COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Orange County sheriff's deputy has been charged with two counts of 
sexual misconduct after confessing to investigators that he had sex with 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent act of religious repentance, former deputy Bret McCammon 
contacted sheriff's officials on March 22, 1989, to confess that he had had sex 
with inmates while he was employed at the Men's Central Jail, Sheriff's 
Department Lt. Bob Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
McCammon, who is now a construction worker, had been hired as a sheriff's 
deputy in 1982. His employment as a deputy ended in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
After a seven-month investigation by the Sheriff's Department and the district 
attorney's office, McCammon was charged with two felony counts of forcing an 
inmate, identified only as James A., to have oral sex with him. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, McCammon, who is a Mormon, said: "I have a desire to 
clean up my life and the church plays a role in that." 
</P>
<P>
McCammon said he could not discuss his case. Deputy Dist. Atty. Wally Wade, who 
is in charge of special investigations, said the Sheriff's Department had 
originally investigated McCammon in 1987 after an inmate filed a complaint 
against the deputy. 
</P>
<P>
McCammon, who is free on his own recognizance, was arraigned Jan. 19. He faces 
a preliminary hearing March 26 in Santa Ana Municipal Court.

GIRL MAY BE AT CENTER OF SCHOOL STABBING

<P>
A dispute that led to this week's stabbing of a Bolsa Grande High School 
student and the arrest of a 13-year-old suspect was apparently touched off by a 
confrontation over a girl, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Salvadore Ceja, 18, was stabbed Wednesday by a 13-year-old member of a rival 
gang who went to the Westminster Boulevard campus seeking a girlfriend, Garden 
Grove Police Lt. Chuck Gibbs said. The younger boy, however, was stopped by 
members of a gang that Ceja allegedly belongs to, Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys happen to be in rival gangs, and there's a . . . girl involved," 
Gibbs said. "But it wouldn't be accurate to say (the 13-year-old boy) went 
looking for the other kids because they were in opposing gangs. It's probably a 
combination of both. We don't know for sure what is the overriding factor 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Grande High Principal George Willson said the incident, which occurred 
after school shortly before 3 p.m., began when the 13-year-old boy, a 
Westminster resident who does not attend the school, went to the campus to meet 
a girl. However, he apparently was confronted by Ceja's companions. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody recognized that this guy didn't belong here, and they decided to 
exert themselves," Willson said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police reports, the confrontation escalated into a fight, during 
which the 13-year-old pulled a knife and stabbed Ceja twice in the back and 
once in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
Willson said a custodian intervened and attempted to grab the 13-year-old by 
his coat, "but the next thing he knew he was standing there with just the coat 
in his hands." 
</P>
<P>
School officials administered first aid to Ceja and called authorities. Ceja 
was flown by helicopter to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he was reported 
in good condition Friday. 
</P>
<P>
After the stabbing, the 13-year-old boy fled to a nearby apartment, where a 
friend who is also a gang member lives, Gibbs said. Police tracked him down and 
arrested him about 7 p.m. He was booked at Juvenile Hall on suspicion of 
attempted murder. His name has not been released because he is a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a lot of cooperation from a lot of witnesses and a lot of different 
people," Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other juveniles who were in the apartment were also arrested and charged 
with harboring the 13-year-old, Gibbs said. They were also believed to be 
members of the gang. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs said investigators were still attempting to determine which gangs, if 
any, Ceja and the 13-year-old belonged to, and whether the rivalry was also a 
factor in the stabbing. "Who's to say what the motive was?" Gibbs said. 
"Gang-bangers will fight over dirty looks." 
</P>
<P>
The gangs involved in the incident are believed to be "newer gangs, offshoots 
of other gangs," Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
Willson said he also did not know which gangs were involved but added that gang 
activity was unusual at Bolsa Grande and that the stabbing was the first 
violent incident there in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
"This campus . . . is graffiti-free," he said. "We keep track of what's going 
on here. The thing with some of these (gangs) is they're here today and gone 
tomorrow. If you're talking about long-established groups, to this point, we 
haven't had them." TONY MARCANO

ACTION TOO LATE TO SAVE EUCALYPTUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA MICHAELIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until recently, nobody really noticed the towering eucalyptus tree beside City 
Hall. City officials couldn't say how old the tree was or how tall. And the 
city Design Review Board apparently ignored the tree when approving plans for 
renovating the corner where it stood. 
</P>
<P>
But when public works employees began sawing off the tree's limbs, the action 
resulted in a petition drive, a promise to replace the eucalyptus with $10,000 
worth of new trees, and a proposal to fine people who chop down large trees in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Lida Lenney successfully suspended the felling about halfway through the 
process but later was convinced that the tree was damaged too severely to be 
saved. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a tree-hugger, and this was not an easy decision," Lenney said. 
</P>
<P>
The ax came down on the eucalyptus Feb. 28, according to Linda Rushing, a 
Laguna Canyon Conservancy member who phoned city officials as soon as she 
noticed workers sawing the tree. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lenney, members of the Design Review Board had approved a plan 
that included removing the tree. But she is not sure that board members 
realized the implications of the renovation blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
"When they passed the plans, it appears they just didn't see it," Lenney said. 
</P>
<P>
After Rushing talked to Lenney, the tree work was halted, leaving just 25 feet 
of what Rushing said had been a 70-year-old tree about 35 feet in height. 
</P>
<P>
Lenney said council members thought the tree was worth saving and that plans 
were made to see how the renovation could accommodate it. 
</P>
<P>
But a few days later, a landscape architect told her the tree would probably 
rot in the core and could fall. 
</P>
<P>
This week the City Council decided it was "better to go ahead and cut down the 
tree," Lenney said. 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved spending $10,000 from a contingency fund to buy 
mature trees to replace the eucalyptus, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to avert future tree mishaps, Rushing and several members of the Laguna 
Beach Beautification Committee are pushing for fines to be attached to an 
existing ordinance prohibiting the removal of "heritage trees." 
</P>
<P>
However, there is some disagreement about what constitutes a "heritage tree." 
</P>
<P>
Rushing contends that "heritage trees" are those with circumferences measuring 
more than 55 inches. But City Manager Kenneth Frank said that other factors 
besides girth determine which trees qualify for the status. 
</P>
<P>
"They're historic, stately trees," Frank said. "There's a process for placing 
trees on the list of heritage trees . . . there's only about 50 in the city, 
most are on private property and there are very few eucalyptus among them." 
</P>
<P>
But Rushing, who cited several examples of eucalyptus trees destroyed to make 
way for development projects, said the city should be more cautious in 
assessing the fate of trees in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic that the same City Council that is saving a whole canyon full of 
trees is beginning their renovation by cutting one down," Rushing said. LAURA

26-SQUARE-MILE AREA SPRAYED FOR MEDFLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aerial spraying against the Medfly took place as scheduled Friday night over 
portions of Brea, Fullerton and La Habra, as well as adjacent parts of Los 
Angeles County, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The spraying had been postponed from earlier in the week when high winds 
grounded helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's was the fifth spraying of the 26-square-mile target area. State 
officials say the area will probably be sprayed 10 to 12 times, and as 
frequently as once a week during summer. 
</P>
<P>
The next spraying is scheduled for March 26. 
</P>
<P>
Information on spraying is available by calling (714) 447-7118.

DESPITE RULING, ELECTION PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials are pushing ahead with plans to hold city elections April 10, even 
though Councilmen John Kelly and Earl J. Prescott won a round in their legal 
fight to halt the balloting next month. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Mary E. Wynn sued the City Council last month after its four members 
deadlocked on a resolution necessary to plan for the election. Mayor Richard B. 
Edgar and Councilwoman Ursula E. Kennedy voted for the resolution. Wynn was 
seeking to force Kelly and Prescott to approve the resolution, which provides 
for the location of polling places, the hiring of precinct workers and ballot 
counting. 
</P>
<P>
But Superior Court Judge Eileen C. Moore denied Wynn's lawsuit on Friday. 
Nonetheless, key city officials, including Edgar, Kennedy, City Atty. James G. 
Rourke and City Manager William Huston, met late Friday and decided to proceed 
with the election. The deadline for setting election guidelines is Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rourke said the state Election Code gives the city clerk the authority to set 
the election. 
</P>
<P>
Prescott and Kelly sharply criticized the action. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny how they met in secret in City Hall and came out speaking on behalf 
of Mary Wynn, an elected official, who was not there," Prescott said. "That's 
preposterous. They cannot hold an election after the court ruled the way it did 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, reached at a Tustin restaurant where he was having dinner, said: "Then 
why did we just go through the expense of that legal exercise?" 
</P>
<P>
Prescott's attorney, Anthony Duffy, said the city's action is inconsistent with 
its argument that the council must approve the election resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"They've filed a position in court seeking authority. They said they needed the 
writ issued to have the polling places and other details established," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rourke said Moore's ruling will be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to get it adjudicated," he said. "We believe that the trial judge made 
an error, and we want that to be corrected by a court of appeal. I think it's 
clear that John and Earl failed to perform their duties." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling Friday marked Prescott and Kelly's first significant victory on the 
election issue. Since the council majority moved the election from November to 
April, the two councilmen have unsuccessfully challenged the decision through a 
referendum drive and a lawsuit against former Councilman Ronald B. Hoesterey. 
He resigned shortly after voting with Edgar and Kennedy to move up the 
elections to April. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly and Prescott alleged the decision to move the election was not valid 
because Hoesterey was living outside of the city when he voted for the 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar and Kennedy maintain that Hoesterey was a legal resident and the election 
date change is valid. 
</P>
<P>
In a related legal development, Prescott filed a complaint in Superior Court on 
Thursday asking that the ordinance be ruled invalid because he claims only two 
legitimate council members attended the Nov 20 meeting. Prescott and Kelly 
boycotted that meeting on the advice of their attorneys. SHANNON SANDS

STEADY PLAY EARNS ANDERSON HIS MINUTES;

<P>
PREP BASKETBALL: SERVITE SOPHOMORE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING THE TEAM AS A 
FRESHMAN. NOW, HE NO LONGER WORRIES ABOUT PLAYING TIME.

Adam Anderson wasn't sure what to think when he arrived for the first day of 
freshman basketball tryouts at Servite High School in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He sat on the sideline, nursing a collarbone injury from football season, as 44 
other freshman boys raced up and down the court. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was just a little intimidated, and frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't sure if I would get any playing time on that team," Anderson said. 
"Eddie Rubio and Angel Barrios (who is now at Buena Park) were on that team. I 
showed up that first day of practice and I thought it would be a struggle just 
to make the team." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson doesn't worry much about playing time these days. 
</P>
<P>
He's getting plenty of it as a sophomore on Servite's varsity. He'll be in the 
starting lineup when the Friars (19-11) play Dos Pueblos (18-13) in the 
Southern California Division III Regional championship game at 11:30 a.m. today 
at the L.A. Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a 6-foot-4 forward, smiles when he thinks back to his start at 
Servite. His collarbone healed four weeks into his freshman year and he 
averaged 12 points a game and shot 57.8% from the field for the Friars' 
freshman team, which finished 18-1. 
</P>
<P>
"He was hard to figure out as a freshman," said Richard Smith, Servite's 
first-year coach. "He was quiet. I think he was overwhelmed by the tryouts. We 
had 45 kids come out for our team. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a good freshman year. He had a supporting role and his confidence 
grew." 
</P>
<P>
When Smith was promoted from an assistant coach to head coach this fall, 
Anderson joined the varsity. He has started every game this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a first-year coach, I wanted to set a precedent that people who worked 
hard here were going to play," Smith said. "In practice, Adam showed he wanted 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
"After about four or five games, all of the coaches sat down and evaluated 
everyone. Adam was our most steady player." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson is averaging 10 points and five rebounds a game. He leads the team in 
steals, averaging three a game. His steady play earned him a spot on the 
all-Angelus League first team. 
</P>
<P>
His role on the varsity is similar to the one he had on the freshman team. He 
plays defense, rebounds and takes some of the offensive pressure off leading 
scorer Steve Marusich, a 6-7 center. 
</P>
<P>
"Adam's very active without the ball," Smith said. "He sneaks in behind people 
for layups. He does a lot of things that don't show up in the stats. He's an 
A.C. Green and Kurt Rambis type of player, always going after loose balls and 
getting steals." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson says he's in no rush to score more points. He's satisfied with fitting 
into the Friars' offense. 
</P>
<P>
"The points will come," he said. "Paul (Stapleton) finds me on a pass every 
once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
Smith has been pleased with Anderson's patience. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't tried to force anything," Smith said. "He's blossomed more and more 
as the season has gone on." 
</P>
<P>
Early in the season, Smith wondered how a young, inexperienced sophomore would 
mesh with a team comprised mainly of seniors. Anderson's barely 15 years old -- 
young for a sophomore -- and Smith hoped Anderson had the maturity to play. 
</P>
<P>
"He and Eddie are the only sophomores on the varsity," Smith said. "It was 
tough for them socially at the start of the year. Most of our players are 
seniors, and Adam and Eddie had to find out how to fit in personality-wise, who 
to hang around with and stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they've earned the respect of the older players. Now we even look to 
Adam and Eddie for leadership." 
</P>
<P>
They also like to tease him. The Friars finished Friday's practice with a 
free-throw shooting contest between the starters and the substitutes. The 
object: make seven consecutive free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The starters sank six in a row when Anderson stepped to the line. His shot drew 
iron but no net. He heard all kinds of ribbing after the substitutes rallied to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"My teammates always give me a hard time," Anderson said. "They say I'm the 
best layup shooter in Orange County because I'm always getting the ball inside 
and shooting." 
</P>
<P>
One of Anderson's biggest layups came Thursday night in a 41-39 semifinal 
victory over Corona del Mar. The Friars trailed, 30-21, when Anderson rebounded 
a missed three-pointer by Stapleton, drove to the hoop and laid the ball in. 
</P>
<P>
"He scores a lot of big baskets for us," Smith said. "He had a big hoop on a 
drive in our (57-55 quarterfinal) win against Lemoore. His dad (Russell) came 
up to me after the game and said, 'I don't want to tell you what to do, but you 
need to kick Adam in the butt and tell him to drive to the hoop like that more 
often.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, Anderson has room to improve, Smith said. He moved from center to 
forward when he was promoted to the varsity, and he's been working on his 
shooting range. 
</P>
<P>
"He's also worried that if his ballhandling doesn't improve," Smith said, "I'll 
move him back to center." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson spends all fall working on his basketball game. He gave up football 
after his collarbone injury. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, he'll play pitcher and first base with the junior varsity baseball 
team. In the meantime, he's practicing basketball instead of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think my baseball coaches are too happy about it," he said. "They want 
to see me out there at practice." 
</P>
<P>
And if Anderson has his way, that will come after the state basketball 
tournament March 16-17 in Oakland.

QUINN FINDS PERFECT TIME TO TAKE HIS TURN

Mater Dei High School Coach Gary McKnight called it a fluke. A nice fluke, but 
still a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Quinn called it his turn. 
</P>
<P>
With time running out and the Monarchs trailing, 45-43, Quinn found himself 
trapped in the corner 20 feet from the basket. As the last act of a desperate 
man, he threw the ball up, over two defenders. 
</P>
<P>
The ball swished through the net with 1.8 seconds left to give Mater Dei a 
46-45 victory over Long Beach Poly at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Gasping for breath between bear hugs from teammates, Quinn tried to sort out 
the frantic final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it had a chance to go in. . . . It was just a 'Hail Mary.' . . 
. This is great," said Quinn, a 6-foot senior point guard. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei, which had led by as many as eight points, trailed, 44-40, with 57 
seconds left. But Quinn hit a three-pointer to pull the Monarchs within one. 
</P>
<P>
With 19 seconds left, Long Beach Poly's Willie McGinest made one of two free 
throws, missing the second. Mater Dei's Andy Karich grabbed the rebound and 
passed to Quinn, who dribbled up the right side of the court. 
</P>
<P>
However, Quinn was trapped by 6-5 Rod Hannibal along the right baseline. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for David Boyle, but they had him cut off," Quinn said. "I knew 
time was running out. Someone had to take the shot. It had to be me." 
</P>
<P>
From McKnight's vantage point, the season looked over. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were in trouble," McKnight said. "The plan had been to penetrate, 
then kick the ball back out to Boyle. Everything fell apart." 
</P>
<P>
But Quinn managed to find some room between defenders and threw in the shot 
over Hannibal. He was also fouled on the play, but missed the free throw. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach told me to," Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
After the buzzer, Quinn was mugged by teammates. They lifted him in the air, as 
he extended his arms in jubilation. His shot had put them in the state 
championship game, which will be played next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But Quinn wasn't taken any credit alone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a different guy coming through for us each game," Quinn said. 
"Tonight, it was just my turn." 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs had more than a few problems on offense in the second half. Long 
Beach Poly had used a half-court trap to pressure Mater Dei out of its 
offensive scheme. 
</P>
<P>
But in the fourth quarter, Quinn rescued the Monarchs. He had 10 points in the 
game, but eight came in the final 2:36. 
</P>
<P>
"No one was able to score for us," Quinn said. "Some one had to take charge." 
</P>
<P>
And Quinn did, especially in the final few seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"I just threw it up," he said. "It was desperate. Then I saw the ball go 
through the net. It was incredible."

COOL AS ICE: AIMEE MCDANIEL QUIETLY BECOMES A FORCE FOR BREA-OLINDA;

BECOME TOP SCORER ON NATION'S FOURTH-RANKED TEAM.

<P>
She has inspired the nicknames "ice" and "baby-faced assassin," definite clues 
to the type of basketball player Aimee McDaniel is. 
</P>
<P>
They call her "ice" because Brea-Olinda High School's senior point guard is 
hard-edged and cool under pressure on the court. And baby-faced assassin? Well, 
she's only 5-6, wears her blonde hair in a ponytail, and has the face of a 
cherub. But her passing, the most potent weapon in her arsenal, has riddled 
opposing teams like bullets from an automatic. 
</P>
<P>
It was assistant coach John Hattrup who first called her the baby-faced 
assassin. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the nickname) is not too bad," McDaniel said. "It just bugs me for some 
reason because it reminds me of a killer and I'm not a killer. I mean I have 
been called worse things. 
</P>
<P>
"On the court I'm like a, how do I put this nicely, I'm very aggressive. Off 
the court, I'm sort of hum-de-dum, but on the court I'd do almost anything to 
win. Well, not anything bad." 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda Coach Mark Trakh agrees: "She's very free-spirited, not very 
intense, fun-loving. Something happens when the ball is tipped off. She becomes 
the total antithesis of that." 
</P>
<P>
Though nobody would mistake her for a quick runner or explosive jumper, she 
knows how to play off screens or create openings for her shot. That, and her 
ability to shoot the three-point shot, has helped her become the leading scorer 
(16.5 points a game) on a team that gets double-figure scoring from three other 
starters and is ranked fourth in the nation by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel broke the school's career scoring record of 1,778 points Tuesday in 
the opening round of the Southern California Division III regional basketball 
playoffs in Brea-Olinda's victory over San Diego Lincoln. She has 1,807 points, 
breaking the record set by Carrie Egan from 1984-87. 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily I had a chance to learn the three-point shot and lot of them go in," 
McDaniel said. "A lot of it is just teamwork. When you have the great team I 
played on for four years everything just clicks." With McDaniel running the 
point, the Lady Cats won their first state championship (Division III), had a 
player named the most valuable player in the division -- McDaniel -- and got 
their first national ranking last season. 
</P>
<P>
They are favored to repeat as Southern California regional champions today when 
they face Palos Verdes at 9:30 a.m. at the L.A. Sports Arena. They also are 
heavily favored to repeat as state champions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the first (title) is the most cherished one," McDaniel said, "but 
back-to-back would be nice. I'm not going to say it wouldn't be. There is a lot 
more pressure this year. Like, at the beginning of the year people were already 
planning to go to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard because it is just playing under pressure and we get a little 
big-headed sometimes, and I think Palos Verdes is the perfect team that could 
upset us. We have to keep our heads in it." 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Cats are working on a school-record winning streak of 54 games, second 
in Southern Section girls' basketball history to the 84-game winning streak set 
by the Cheryl Miller-Riverside Poly teams of 1978-82. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the Lady Cats toppled national powers outside Orange 
County, beating Morningside (then top-ranked nationally) and Los Angeles 
Washington to win the Tournament of Champions in Santa Barbara in December. 
</P>
<P>
"Aimee is responsible for bringing our program up a notch and making us a 
national power," Trakh said. 
</P>
<P>
It is against ranked city teams that McDaniel's game seems to rise a level 
along with her intensity. She may bury a three-point shot at the buzzer to send 
a game into overtime as she did against Washington, she may talk trash, if 
invited to. She may just give the icy stare. 
</P>
<P>
Against Morningside, with Brea-Olinda in control late in the game, McDaniel was 
fouled intentionally and hard as she went to the basket, Trakh said. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid got up in her face and said something to her and Aimee said, 'Didn't 
you guys used to be the No. 1 team in the nation?' 
</P>
<P>
"She does it to show she is not intimidated by them. Her attitude for those big 
teams is our equalizer." 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel's greatest strength is her passing. She averages 5.4 assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
"She has a tremendous sense for the game," Trakh said. "On the fast break, if 
she doesn't have a pass, she can wait that split second later for the pass to 
develop and hit that player. She is the best high school passer I have ever 
seen. She throws it soft so the kids can catch it and leads them perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
Though USC, UNLV, Cal State Long Beach were among the schools that came 
calling, McDaniel chose Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to stay at a smaller school," she said. "I don't plan to play 
basketball after college and a good education would be nice to start off with 
in life."

CLOTHESTIME REPORTS LOSS OF $4.2 MILLION 
</P>

Clothestime, the discount women's apparel retail chain, reported a $4.2-million 
loss in the fourth quarter Friday, a downturn in which analysts blame the 
extreme price competition during the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company revealed that two shareholders recently filed a 
class-action lawsuit against Clothestime, alleging that management released 
misleading information about the the firm's financial performance prospects. 
</P>
<P>
The large loss for the three months ended Jan. 27 came on revenue of $45 
million. It had a loss of $2 million on sales of $45.7 million for the fourth 
quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
For the year, Clothestime posted net income of $461,000 on sales of $187 
million. It had a loss of $2.2 million on sales of $171.4 million for the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
"Clothestime is not the only retail company having a difficult time," said Otto 
Grote, a retail analyst with Derby Securities, a New York securities research 
firm. "The problem was that department stores were heavily discounting goods 
during the peak Christmas season, and a whole raft of specialty stores and 
women's apparel retailers got caught in it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to Friday's news, Clothestime stock fell 44 cents, to $4.44 in 
trading on the over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
The company said two shareholders, Herbert Van Horn and Lee Squiteri, filed a 
lawsuit Feb. 16 in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana against the company and 
several top officers, including chief executive Michael P. DeAngelo and vice 
chairman Raymond A. DeAngelo. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed on behalf of those who bought Clothestime stock from April 17 
to Feb. 1, alleges that company officials during that period conspired to issue 
"a series of false public statements . . . about Clothestime's finances, 
business prospects, results from operations, marketing techniques and 
merchandise." 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that such statements helped to boost the price of Clothestime 
stock to $15 a share in August. The suit further alleges that when the stock 
price was high, Clothestime officers benefited by selling shares that they 
owned. 
</P>
<P>
Clothestime said it needed to study the lawsuit further before responding to 
the allegations.

Stake Increased: General Automation, the struggling Anaheim computer vendor, 
said Thursday that Sanderson Electronics PLC of the United Kingdom has 
increased its stake in the firm from 35% to 49%. Sanderson exercised warrants 
and loan conversion rights it received when it agreed to provide up to $4 
million in financing to General Automation in December, 1988. General 
Automation has recently begun to turn a small profit after years of heavy 
losses.

Westport Savings Seized: Federal thrift regulators seized Westport Savings Bank 
on Friday and put it in receivership, saying it was insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
Its assets of $163 million were transferred to a newly created thrift called 
Westport Federal Savings Bank, which was put under control of the Resolution 
Trust Corp. In 1984, a group of South Orange County investors bought Westport, 
which had opened in Hanford in 1979, and moved its headquarters to Mission 
Viejo. The group later opened a branch in Laguna Beach. After a change in 
directorship more than a year ago, the thrift moved its headquarters back to 
Hanford.

'COASTERS' TO BRING '50S BACK TO CLUB FOUL PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Long known as a haven for hard rockers, the club Foul Play is taking a long 
step backward tonight with two shows by the Coasters, a '50s rock 'n' roll 
vocal group. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the trio that will sing at Foul Play is one of many groups touring 
under the Coasters name. The original group is a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 
inductee that coined such lighthearted hits as "Yakety Yak" and "Charley 
Brown." 
</P>
<P>
Club owner Ezra Joseph said the three Coasters who will play shows at 9 and 11 
are Grady Chapman, Jerome Evans and Patrick Jackson. None is listed in rock 
reference books as a member of the original group during its peak years, but 
Chapman sang with the Robins, a Los Angeles vocal group that was a predecessor 
of the Coasters. These Coasters are not otherwise connected to the Coasters led 
by Cornelius Gunter, a '50s-vintage Coaster who was killed recently in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph said tonight's Coasters shows foreshadows a regular series of Saturday 
night oldies shows at Foul Play -- with Jackson, who lives in Huntington Beach, 
helping to bring in the acts. "Patrick is going to book Saturday nights 
starting April 28," Joseph said. "We'll do bands like Brenton Wood, the 
Drifters and the Platters. They're all friends, and they're dying for a place 
to play. It's what I like to call the expansion of the club -- less punk and 
more other acts to mix in." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Joseph said, he is going to continue booking some of the hard 
rock acts that have been Foul Play's bread and butter since its earlier 
incarnation as Night Moves. Upcoming rock and punk dates include a slate of 
longtime Night Moves regulars: Gherkin Raucous, April 1; the Weirdos, April 5; 
Cadillac Tramps, April 14; Rattlesnake Shake, April 20, and Celebrity Skin, 
April 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coasters play tonight at 9 and 11 at Foul Play, 5902 Warner Ave., 
Huntington Beach. Tickets cost $10, with one admission good for both shows. 
Information: (714) 840-6118.

AMERICAN TELEVISION SETS STAGE FOR TERRORISTS, EXPERT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERMAN WONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Terrorism isn't a pretty subject. It evokes images that are at once horrendous 
and deadly, but also enormously dramatic and compelling. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, argues Alex Schmid -- an international expert on terrorism who was at 
UC Irvine on Wednesday for a lecture -- these hijackings, kidnapings, bombings 
and related violence are tailor-made for prime time TV. 
</P>
<P>
This is especially true, he said, for prolonged acts of terrorism, such as the 
1985 Shia Muslim hijacking of TWA Flight 847 and the international bargaining 
that led to the release of 39 American hostages more than two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
"This was television (coverage) at its fastest, most exciting and competitive 
-- and theatrical in a storytelling sense," said Schmid, a political scientist 
at the State University of Leiden in the Netherlands, in an interview at UCI's 
Center for Global Peace and Conflict Studies. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the American television coverage of the Flight 847 drama was 
typically too simplified, too keyed to pure emotions and subjected to the needs 
of "commercial news values" and high audience ratings. 
</P>
<P>
The Flight 847 incident, said Schmid -- a specialist in international media 
coverage of terrorism -- became "a theater of terror" and a series of 
"terrorist spectaculars" for American audiences. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of coverage, he said, demonstrates the peculiar relations between the 
media and terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been said the terrorists manipulate the media. But it can also be said 
these are examples of mutual manipulation," he added. "I tend to subscribe to 
the argument that the media in many cases inspire and encourage terrorism -- 
that the media can be the oxygen which terrorists need to stay alive." 
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old, Swiss-born Schmid lectured on "Terrorism and the Media: 
Freedom of Information vs. Freedom From Intimidation." It was the latest 
segment in the first program of its kind in Orange County -- a nine-lecture 
series on the nature and impact of terrorism throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
Usually the Center for Global Peace and Conflict Studies, a multidiscipline 
program formed six years ago at UC Irvine, concerns itself with nuclear 
disarmament, Soviet society, American foreign relations and defense policies, 
and international peacemaking organizations, said center director Keith Nelson, 
a history professor. The center does not have specific studies or research on 
terrorism, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
"But terrorism, obviously, is an exceptionally timely topic and -- because of 
the hostages and other incidents -- a now familiar one for many Americans," 
Nelson said. "The field is also related to another of our center's research 
concerns -- public opinion and the role of the media in matters of conflict." 
</P>
<P>
During his visit to UC Irvine, Schmid focused on those he calls "insurgent 
terrorists," such as the Shia Muslim militants in the 1985 TWA hijacking. 
</P>
<P>
He said such acts, including bombings in public places, are in effect "war 
crimes but committed in times of peace." These are "unprovoked violent attacks 
against non-combatants" who are "randomly chosen or who are seen by terrorists 
as symbolic or representative targets." 
</P>
<P>
And these terrorists, above all else, need -- and exist on -- media attention. 
"In other words, a new kind of violence has come about in the last two decades 
-- a kind of violence which is performed in order to be reported," Schmid said. 
"If it is not reported, it cannot be successful. 
</P>
<P>
"These terrorists try to conquer space in the papers and on the airwaves. They 
are waging a media war," Schmid said. "The attention that a mere handful of 
terrorists get through perpetrating atrocities gives them status -- a negative 
status in the eyes of many -- but status, nevertheless." 
</P>
<P>
In Schmid's mind, American television often comes across as too eager, at times 
even too accommodating, in covering terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
This is particularly true of the commercial networks, where the "marketing 
advantages" are obvious, Schmid maintained. "The terrorist stories possess the 
kind of highly personalized drama that translates into higher ratings," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been said -- with some exaggeration -- that terrorism is so ideally 
suited to television that the medium would have invented the phenomenon if it 
had not already existed." 
</P>
<P>
Under these criteria, the Flight 847 hostage crisis, which dominated the news 
for weeks, couldn't have been better for the American networks, Schmid said. 
</P>
<P>
"It became a situation where television itself, including the (network) 
anchormen, became participants -- acting as go-betweens for the American 
government and the terrorists," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The relentless daily coverage was a crucial factor in pressuring the Reagan 
Administration to seek the release of the 39 American hostages, Schmid said. 
One American, a serviceman, had already been killed by the hijackers, who had 
forced the flight from Athens to Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a case of television diplomacy at work," said Schmid of the outcome -- 
the exchange of the Americans for 700 Shia Muslim militiamen held prisoner in 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he argued, the television accounts were critically lacking in 
depth. Coverage "was much too simplified, keyed almost totally to the most 
emotional levels of its viewers," Schmid said. He also noted that fast-breaking 
technology of television lends itself to greater pressures for "obtaining 
scoops" and to less time for assessing and editing the immense flow of 
information. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time we realize that we should not have our minds captivated by messages 
of intimidation which are administered to us under the guise of information," 
Schmid said. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not deny that there is a place for reporting violence in our societies," 
Schmid said. "Yet I think that an attempt should be made by the media to 
distinguish between genuine violence -- which would have taken place anyway -- 
and histrionic violence aimed at audience manipulation. Whenever the latter is 
suspect, coverage should be minimal." 
</P>
<P>
To this end, Schmid contends that some kind of "code of ethics" could be 
adopted by the media that contains "some restraints" on coverage but would not 
conflict with the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
"Between a total blackout on one hand, and saturation coverage on the other, 
there is room," Schmid added, "for reasonable compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 The three remaining lectures in the terrorism series, presented by the Center 
for Global Peace and Conflict Studies, are: April 11, Robert Kupperman, Center 
for Strategic and International Studies; April 25, Christon Archer, University 
of Calgary, and May 23, Richard Falk, Princeton University. All 8 p.m., UCI's 
Physical Sciences Lecture Hall. Call (714) 856-6410 or 856-5000 for ticket 
information.

TIME ON HIS HANDS; 
</P>
<P>
A CLOCK REPAIRMAN SHARES HIS SKILLS SO CRAFT WILL SURVIVE

<P>
A dozen or so clocks -- some silenced by a yet-to-be-diagnosed ailment, others 
robustly ticking away -- surround Lad Taylor with a constant reminder of the 
very thing that seems to be forgotten in his workplace -- time. 
</P>
<P>
The ragged, drab, green carpet looks as though it has not encountered a vacuum 
cleaner in 20 years. The walls are shedding their plaster. The two vinyl easy 
chairs, their stuffing bursting at this seam and that, are coated with dust. 
The ashtrays are full of cigarette butts; the air is full of stale smoke. 
</P>
<P>
His telephone, which dates back deep into the Dial Age, rings every 30 or so 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello," he answers, none too perkily. "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nine to five, five 
days a week. Can't tell you that -- have to price 'em as they come. Yeah. Bye." 
</P>
<P>
There's an adjective that exactly, precisely describes what Taylor is not -- 
solicitous. 
</P>
<P>
He does not solicit business. He does not solicit popularity. He does not 
solicit publicity. You call him; he won't call you. 
</P>
<P>
When a man excels in an increasingly rare craft -- one that will be necessary 
until the end of time -- he has no need to peddle himself. 
</P>
<P>
How many clock repairmen of his caliber are still around in Orange County? 
Taylor thinks for a moment before responding, "Maybe three." Not to brag. Ask 
him an honest question, he'll give you an honest answer. 
</P>
<P>
"Us old fellows are dying off, and there aren't enough young ones coming in to 
keep this trade alive," he says. "Millions of clocks came over from Europe 
after World War II. Eventually, they're either going to have to be cleaned or 
repaired. Plus, new ones are being made. In another 20 or 30 years, there isn't 
going to be anyone left to do the repairing." 
</P>
<P>
So the 73-year-old pro hopes to disseminate the art of piecing together 
timepieces before time runs out. He recently began teaching a class in 
clock-making at Rancho Santiago College -- right down the street from his Santa 
Ana office/home. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry is posed as casually as possible: Oh, by the way -- does he, uh, 
live here? 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, no. I wouldn't live in this dump," Taylor responds to a mute sigh of 
relief. "This place is ready for the bulldozer. My wife and I live in a house 
in the back." 
</P>
<P>
A total stranger to Taylor has just dropped by. He introduces himself as John 
Hanneman, a clock repairman who drove in from Sun City to seek Taylor's 
respected counsel. Hanneman is in a bit of a tizzy; he's relatively new at this 
business and can't quite figure out the inner workings of an antique specimen 
left in his care. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor takes the visitor under his wing and proceeds to give him more than he 
possibly could have bargained for: a hard-to-find part essential to the antique 
clock's revival; a lesson in "bushing" improvisation, and a demonstration of 
custom-made tools. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got decades of experience, I've got five years," Hanneman says. "I took 
this up after I retired from the federal government." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to show you something," Taylor tells his admirer. The something he 
shows Hanneman is how to punch new bushings out of cost-free, readily available 
material -- a clock's inside panel. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, lovely," Hanneman marvels. "A boxful of bushings is $60, so when you can 
save that kind of money, it's a godsend." 
</P>
<P>
To a lay person's eyes, the doodads look like mere dots of metal. But those 
dots represent the nuts and bolts of clock repair. Bushings supplement 
minuscule holes that -- through years of rubbing against the moving parts they 
encase -- have become too elongated. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is chock-full of such wisdom. "It's something a person picks up," he 
says. "Like these pliers -- they're my invention. My brother made them. He's a 
master mechanic." 
</P>
<P>
You would have to understand what makes a clock tick to appreciate the pliers' 
worth. However, one could deduce by the men's reverence for the tool that it 
indeed works wonders. 
</P>
<P>
Next Taylor shows off a gadget that holds steady the mainspring's barrel for 
winding and unwinding. But just in case you have any big ideas, don't imagine 
that you can run right out and buy one. "There's a guy in Colorado who made 
these, and sold the rights to some big company," the expert clock repairman 
says. "Last I've seen of it (on the market) was 10 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Then he takes his tourists into a disheveled room meant to be a kitchen. "This 
is my pride and joy," he says, pointing at a complex gadget. Clockmakers know 
it as an instrument lathe, used for shaping pivots and shafts. "It's worth 
$25,000; I got it through a horse-trade some years back." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, lovely," Hanneman again enthuses. 
</P>
<P>
Then Taylor points at another machine: "That's for cleaning clock parts." Then 
at a more familiar device: "And that's my coffee pot." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor decides to show his temporary apprentice another trick of the trade. The 
lesson requires a certain internal mechanism, so he volunteers one of his own 
clocks as an organ donor. "This is the way you take a clock apart," he says, 
straight-faced, and haphazardly dumps its innards on his desk. 
</P>
<P>
"I could shake apart a clock and know where all the pieces go when I put it 
back together," he adds, after his little joke has won the desired laughs. 
"Younger fellows have to draw pictures of where everything goes. It's quite a 
process." 
</P>
<P>
A customer walks in to pick up his clock. "How much do I owe you?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty dollars. Your clock should be good for another few years now," Taylor 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"All I have to do is live long enough to get my money's worth," the customer 
cracks. 
</P>
<P>
The three men, all hypothetically retired, start talking about advanced age. 
"My brother's 82 years old, and he says he's going to live to be 105 and get 
shot by a jealous husband," Taylor interjects. "I intend to stay with it (clock 
repairing), unless I get arthritis in my hands or something like that." 
</P>
<P>
He has already retired once. "I had a TV repair business for years. Back in 
1970, I had a heart attack, and my doctor said I couldn't do any more heavy 
lifting, so I closed down my business. My wife says, 'What are you going to 
do?' And I says, 'All I know is clocks.' " 
</P>
<P>
Taylor has tinkered with clocks ever since he was a boy growing up in 
Huntington Beach. His knack seems genetic. "My father was an auto mechanic; my 
older brother is a master mechanic; my younger brother is an architectural 
engineer," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a talent -- the knowledge of mechanical things, plus the ability to use 
your hands." 
</P>
<P>
Repairing clocks has not made him rich, but it has made him satisfied. "The 
reason I do this is because I've liked it from the beginning," he says. "You've 
got to like your job, or you're lost." 
</P>
<P>
And his profession has made him a statesman in his own field. In 1972, Taylor 
founded the Orange County chapter of the National Assn. of Watch and Clock 
Collectors, which still meets once a month and boasts 120 members. 
</P>
<P>
Of his celebrity status he says: "Yeah. It's an ego trip. That's all it is." 
</P>
<P>
His customer leaves. His telephone rings. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's right, a class in clock-making. Once a week. 
Well, I don't charge anything -- the college does." He glances up with an 
amused smile, treating his guests to his private, deadpan humor. Of course, the 
caller cannot see Taylor's grin. The caller probably assumes that he's just 
plain gruff. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my first time to teach a college class," he says after hanging up. 
"I've taught five or six people at a time, never a whole class. The college 
heard about me and asked if I'd do it. I figured I should. It's real important 
that a new generation learns this trade." 
</P>
<P>
"If I ever decide to retire, maybe one of my students will take over my 
business. I'd have to handpick him," Taylor says, almost wistfully, having no 
one in mind at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor himself does not make clocks, as the title of his class indicates. Nor 
does he collect watches and clocks, as the title of his club indicates. He just 
repairs clocks. And he just repairs clocks. No watches -- clocks and only 
clocks. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been much on wanting a 300- or 400-year-old clock just because it's 
valuable," he says. "I like them; I'm just not the collector type." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he and his wife have managed to acquire a few beauties -- which she lays 
claim to, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Guess I ought to bring out our pieces de resistence," he says, then vanishes 
into his living quarters. Taylor soon returns with a pair of century-old 
carriage clocks. 
</P>
<P>
One is an ornate, gold-plated British work of art, decorated with silver, 
mermaidlike creatures. The other is a simple, elegant French design. Each is 
worth thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Carriage clocks are the original travel clocks. Before glow-in-the-dark digital 
numbers, voyagers brought along the portable clocks to keep track of nighttime. 
"You push this button, and the clock chimes the hour," Taylor explains. 
</P>
<P>
"Clocks are the only machines that survive," he notes, admiring his prized 
possessions. "I've worked on 150-year-old clocks that haven't needed a single 
new part." 
</P>
<P>
Alas, they don't make clocks like they used to, he complains: "Modern clocks 
wear a lot faster. Even in expensive new clocks, the material is cheap -- the 
metal is thin and soft. When I get modern clocks in here, every one of them 
needs new bushings." 
</P>
<P>
Those trendy plastic wristwatches annoy him. "They can be bought for $4 to $25; 
when they break down, it's cheaper to throw them away than to have them fixed. 
</P>
<P>
"We in the United States are the biggest wasters. Everything is disposable. You 
use something once, you throw it away -- plastic bags, cardboard, paper. Not 
only is it bad for the environment, it's a waste of talent and workmanship." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly Taylor's wife, Jeanne, breezes in, every bit as vivacious as he is 
curmudgeonly. "If anything happens to my clocks, somebody dies," she teases, 
sort of. Then just as suddenly, she disappears. 
</P>
<P>
At that very instant, right on cue, a customer comes walking through the door. 
"How splendid!" he says, immediately spotting the two carriage clocks. "Want to 
sell them?" 
</P>
<P>
"My wife would kill me. She just told me so," Taylor answers. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, if you ever get a divorce from your wife, we'll do business," the man 
assures him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been married to her for 53 years. I think at this point I'll keep her," 
Taylor reckons. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, Hanneman -- Taylor's pupil -- has been a fly on the wall, 
quietly observing his mentor in action. He announces that he had best be going, 
to beat the afternoon traffic. 
</P>
<P>
It's not unusual for tyros to show up on his doorstep, Taylor says after 
Hanneman has departed. He accommodates them. Some of them pay him for his time, 
some of them don't. "The main thing I care about is that people learn this 
profession," he reiterates. "Every trade needs teachers." 
</P>
<P>
An ambitious clock repairman could bring in $60,000 a year, Taylor says. "I 
don't make that kind of money, because this is more a hobby for me than a 
business. I don't charge the going rates, and I only work about 25 hours a 
week. As you can see" -- he motions to his television set -- "I goof off a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
And he doesn't bother to promote himself. "I haven't spent one cent on 
advertising," Taylor says. "I get plenty of business through word of mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Time -- measuring it accurately -- is his job, his talent, his existence. Has 
his profession given him a different perspective on the stuff life is made of? 
</P>
<P>
Taylor does not treat the question as if it were silly, which some would argue 
that it is. He ponders it, then haltingly responds: 
</P>
<P>
"Well . . . I don't even know how to explain this. . . . Time is relevant, just 
like age. I don't think of myself as being as old as I am. I don't dwell on 
age. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Time is what you make it. I guess that's what I'm trying to say."

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: AFTER 5 YEARS OF REJECTION, NOVEL WINS PRIZE, RAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a writer, Merrill Joan Gerber has an impressive track record. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past three decades, she has had two collections of short stories, nine 
young-adult novels and four adult novels published. That's not to mention the 
more than 60 short stories she has written for magazines, including the 
Atlantic, the New Yorker and Redbook, where she has published more stories than 
any other writer in the history of the magazine: 41, as of the May issue. 
</P>
<P>
And yet "King of the World," her critically acclaimed new novel about family 
violence and its underlying causes, was rejected 26 times over a five-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Rejection is not something the Sierra Madre writer is used to. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly not when I thought this was my most powerful work to date and I had 
taken a lot of risks in writing it," said Gerber, 51. "I thought I was offering 
them something pretty significant. It was very discouraging, particularly 
because they were what you'd call 'rave' rejections. Most of the (rejection) 
letters said, 'This is dazzling and astounding, but we don't see a way that we 
can sell it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The novel, she said, was deemed too depressing by most editors. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Gerber had already decided to retire her novel to a drawer when "King 
of the World" was nominated for the Pushcart Press Editors' Book Award, an 
annual award given to "overlooked manuscripts of enduring literary value." 
</P>
<P>
Gerber was notified early last year that "King of the World" had won the prize, 
which includes publication by Pushcart Press, a New York publishing house. 
</P>
<P>
The novel, which in the words of the dust jacket "convincingly details the 
allure of marriage to a deeply troubled and needy man and one woman's 
realization that to survive she has to cut herself off and start over," was 
published in January to rave reviews. Los Angeles Times book reviewer Carolyn 
See said it attempts "to get below the journalistic surface of a very bad 
social problem, and succeeds, memorably." 
</P>
<P>
Gerber plans to discuss how "King of the World" ultimately survived five years 
of rejection at a daylong writers conference March 17 at Saddleback College in 
Mission Viejo. "People really love to hear that because it's instructive: You 
have to rely on an inward strength to go ahead" as a writer, she says. 
</P>
<P>
The conference, "Writing for Love, Art and Money," will cover children's 
literature, fiction and nonfiction. The $75 fee includes a box lunch. To 
register, call (714) 582-4646. 
</P>
<P>
Conference coordinator Shelba Robison, who teaches creative writing at the 
college, said the conference "is the first one of what I hope will be an annual 
event." 
</P>
<P>
"The title of the conference reflects the philosophy I hope that our writing 
program has: writing for love, art and money. I maintain if you don't write for 
the first, the other two aren't going to come, for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Robison said she had wanted to offer a writer's conference "for a long time, 
and I wanted it to be a quality experience: I wanted to get special people who 
reflect this sort of triple whammy." 
</P>
<P>
The speakers roster includes Carolyn Arnold, author of more than 50 nonfiction 
books for young people; children's book authors Marilyn Gould and Leslie 
McGuire; Robert Howland, president of a publishing and communications company 
and co-author of "The Complete Guide to Writing Fiction and Nonfiction and 
Getting It Published"; and Yvonne Hubbs of the Yvonne Hubbs Literary Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the list are Greg Lee, West Coast managing editor of Carnival 
Enterprises, which produces more than 150 children's books a year; author Myron 
Roberts, the founding editor and publisher of L.A. magazine, which later became 
Los Angeles magazine; and journalist Robert Scheer, a national correspondent 
for the Los Angeles Times and a frequent contributor to Harper's, Esquire, 
Interview and Premiere magazines. 
</P>
<P>
The morning keynote speaker will be James N. Frey, author of "How to Write a 
Damn Good Novel." And, in the afternoon, Gerber will discuss "Crossing the Fine 
Line Between Literary and Commercial Fiction." 
</P>
<P>
Gerber, who teaches writing at Caltech, UCLA and Pasadena College, said writers 
conferences "are wonderful because you realize that others are following the 
same endeavor, and it gives you a sense of confidence and community with these 
other people -- and it tends to send you home to your typewriter." 
</P>
<P>
Although she received $1,000 in prize money from Pushcart Press for "King of 
the World," Gerber said, "the real prize is the publication." 
</P>
<P>
What made the long string of rejections for her novel especially hard to take, 
she said, was that in each publishing house the manuscript was sent to, "there 
were one or two people who wanted to publish it. But publishing now exists by 
committee, and there was always one editor who said, 'We'd better not.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gerber said, however, that Bill Henderson of Pushcart Press "is a small, 
literary, fine publisher, and he doesn't have a committee he has to report to 
-- which is how the old editors used to (operate) when publishing was a 
different animal." 
</P>
<P>
"King of the World" is already in a second printing. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for the subject to be talked about, I think," Gerber said, 
"because the public awareness now is very great about the kind of domestic 
violence that exists in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Gerber said she first gained insight into the problem years ago when she worked 
on a crisis hot line and "became aware of the large number of frightened women 
-- wives and mothers. I also have seen this phenomenon in many of the people I 
know. Every other woman who reads this book says, 'That was my first husband, 
or my father, or a man I almost married.' " 
</P>
<P>
The lesson to be gained by her novel's long odyssey to publication, Gerber 
said, is this: "To follow your own vision. Because you can't possibly please 
everyone -- especially since publishers don't really know what they're looking 
for. Publishers really can't second-guess what the public wants. Unfortunately, 
they often underestimate what the public is capable of understanding."

JOSEPH N. BELL: SUPREME COURT RULING ON DRUG EXPERIMENTS RAISES SPECTER OF 
RADIATION TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I last saw her almost three years ago, Pat Broudy -- a diminutive dynamo 
of energy and persistence who lives in Laguna Niguel -- was on the verge of 
becoming the first American citizen to successfully challenge the sovereign 
immunity concept of the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
She had filed a wrongful-death suit against the government on behalf of her 
deceased husband, Marine Corps Maj. Charles Broudy, who died of lymphoma in 
1977 after heavy exposure to nuclear tests in the Nevada desert as a military 
observer. Although the original suit was dismissed twice in U.S. District 
Court, that decision was twice overturned in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
It all ended June 22, 1987, when the appeals court refused to overturn the 
lower court decision the third time around. Pat Broudy was dismayed but not 
defeated. Her long court battle publicized the plight of the victims of 
government-induced radiation and their families. And it got the attention of 
public officials who no longer ignore the activities of the National Assn. of 
Radiation Survivors -- of which Broudy is an official. 
</P>
<P>
I ran into her a few weeks ago on the UC Irvine campus. She had taken the day 
off from her job as a legal secretary to help her son -- a UCI senior -- pass 
out leaflets urging students to attend the upcoming appearance of Ron Kovic on 
campus. She looked like an average sophomore in her blue jeans and matching 
jacket, and she waved me over to her table. 
</P>
<P>
"When my case was argued," she said, "government attorneys admitted in court 
that the government knew the dangers of radiation from testing but felt it was 
worth the sacrifice of a few men for the good of the country. Now I know that 
this concept goes far beyond radiation. I've been digging around in a lot of 
obscure government documents, and I've discovered that we carried out all sorts 
of experiments on people who knew nothing about it. The whole thing is terribly 
frightening." 
</P>
<P>
She pulled out a stack of documents and began showing me what she meant. I 
asked if I could take the documents with me and look them over a little more 
leisurely. She agreed, and they have been sitting in a sack under my desk ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
Then last week, The Times published a story out of Washington, D.C., on a 6-3 
ruling by the Supreme Court that the government may legally force prison 
inmates to take mind-altering drugs against their will. The decision written 
for the majority by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy concluded: "Notwithstanding the 
risks that are involved, we conclude that the inmate's interests are adequately 
protected, and perhaps better served, by allowing the decision to medicate to 
be made by medical professionals rather than a judge." 
</P>
<P>
This reminded me instantly of Pat Broudy's documents, so I began reading them. 
They are, indeed, frightening, enough so that Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), 
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, was moved to write the 
Secretary of the Department of Energy in 1986 that American scientists were led 
to "mimic the kind of demented human experiments conducted by the Nazis." 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee's report -- aptly entitled "American Nuclear Guinea Pigs: 
Three Decades of Radiation Experiments on U.S. Citizens" -- described in detail 
programs in which 695 people were deliberately subjected to radiation 
experiments, some designed to intentionally cause injury, performed on "captive 
audiences or populations that some experimenters frighteningly perhaps might 
have considered 'expendable': the elderly, prisoners, hospital patients 
suffering from terminal diseases who might not have retained their full 
faculties for informed consent." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the correspondence between doctors involved in this program sounds like 
a bad science fiction movie script. This was not untypical: "I am writing 
concerning our experimental subject, Mr. Stephens . . . who was given the 50 
micrograms two months ago. We are very much afraid that the man, due to his 
illness, may sell his house and go to live at some distant point which would, 
of course, put an end to our most interesting series of experiments." 
</P>
<P>
A government document entitled "Testing and Use of Chemical and Biological 
Agents by the Intelligence Community" in 1976 was even scarier. This one 
detailed the story of Dr. Frank Olson, a civilian employee of the Army, who was 
given 70 micrograms of LSD in a cocktail by a CIA officer when they were 
drinking together -- apparently just to see what would happen. What happened 
was that Olson freaked out and a week later jumped or fell to his death from a 
10th-story hotel window in New York City. And the CIA, under director Richard 
Helms, kept right on slipping LSD Mickey Finns in the drinks of unsuspecting 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
When the U.S. Senate subcommittee finally got wind of these activities and 
aired them in hearings, its final report read, in part: "These research and 
development programs to find materials which could be used to alter human 
behavior . . . resulted in massive abridgements of the right of American 
citizens, sometimes with tragic consequences. . . . The nature of the tests, 
their scale, and the fact that they were continued for years after the danger 
of surreptitious administration of LSD was known demonstrate a fundamental 
disregard for the value of human life." 
</P>
<P>
And remember, we're not talking about the Gestapo here, or the KGB. We're 
talking about the good old American CIA. 
</P>
<P>
To Pat Broudy, this knowledge added up to total frustration. She expected to 
find outrage when she talked about it; instead, she got yawns. "Nobody cares," 
she says angrily. "Nobody cares at all." 
</P>
<P>
Those who do react tell her this all happened so long ago that it scarcely 
matters now. "But it does matter," she says. "I don't know that it isn't still 
going on, but whether it is or not, the only way to be sure that it doesn't 
happen again is for the public to express outrage." 
</P>
<P>
She hopes that last week's Supreme Court decision allowing prison inmates to be 
injected with mind-altering drugs against their will wakes some people up to 
the broader implications of that decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Think what Richard Helms could have done with that kind of legal support," she 
says. "Or George Bush when he was head of the CIA."

THE STAMP ACT; 
</P>
<P>
HOBBIES: TAKE A RUBBER STAMP. ADD ONE OF A MULTITUDE OF MEDIUMS. THERE YOU HAVE 
IT: INSTANT ART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHERI RAE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a movement afoot to stamp out art. News about this movement has spread 
through retail outlets and specialty stores. It has its own magazine, books and 
devotees, who have turned it into a multimillion-dollar industry. 
</P>
<P>
Who is at the forefront of this movement? People who have discovered the art of 
the rubber stamp. 
</P>
<P>
From young children to adults, these are people who have never thought of 
themselves as artists but yearn to create. 
</P>
<P>
Cyndi Fox, a self-described minor stamp artist, says: "Stamps allow the average 
person to feel creative. You don't have to be an artist, you just have to be 
able to hit a pad with a stamp and voila! You're as good as Picasso ever was." 
</P>
<P>
Fox, who works at See Spot Run, a rubber stamp emporium at Los Angeles' Farmers 
Market, may exaggerate a bit. But many noted artists have used rubber stamps. 
</P>
<P>
The Dada movement in the 1920s prominently featured rubber stamp images. Saul 
Steinberg, Andy Warhol and Sister Corita Kent dabbled in stamp art techniques. 
Sixties buffs may remember "Be Here Now" by Baba Ram Dass, a counterculture 
classic completely illustrated by rubber stamp art. 
</P>
<P>
Stamping and mailing have always gone together. In the late '50s, there was 
even a "Correspondence Art" movement with hundreds of artists sending their 
rubber stamped art to each other -- in effect, using the mail as a gallery 
wall. (Some stampers swear Elvis was caught up in this movement; witness his 
testimonial anthem "Return to Sender.") 
</P>
<P>
But before art, there was commerce. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1860s, Charles Goodyear perfected the process of vulcanizing and curing 
rubber, thus making it possible to mold and hold an impression. The U.S. Post 
Office was one of his first customers; "Return to Sender" and "Postage Due" 
were among the first rubber stamps. Today, the postal service owns what many 
believe to be the largest collection of rubber stamps in the world. 
</P>
<P>
While the post office may use the most stamps, its message is hardly artistic. 
For Art with a capital A, prospective stampers have to get their hands on a 
stamp. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at them they're fun; when you hold them and use them they're 
fun," says Gary Dorothy, owner of Stampa Barbara, the nation's largest rubber 
stamp store with about 75,000 stamps. 
</P>
<P>
"And when you receive something that's been stamped, it's delightful." 
</P>
<P>
Several enthusiastic stampers were browsing through Dorothy's shop recently. 
One 7-year-old was looking for a gift for her violin teacher; the debate over 
the rabbit playing a violin and a frog playing a violin was a long one. 
</P>
<P>
Comedian Mark Pitta was shopping for ways to stand out from the crowd. He 
decided on a stamp that portrays "Really Ugly Ties." 
</P>
<P>
As he watches his customers shop, Dorothy observes: "People will say, 'I'm not 
creative.' But they really are. They just haven't had the right medium. People 
learned early on that they weren't good at drawing and painting, but rubber 
stamps help them change that perception about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Forged in rubber, ready and waiting for the artist are stamps of birds and 
bees, flowers and trees, 747s and Model Ts. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday stamps celebrate St. Patrick's Day, Easter, Halloween and Christmas; 
Valentine's Day sentiments can be celebrated year 'round, with hearts and 
roses, kissing couples and even a few mildly naughty motifs. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of stamps is overwhelming. Teddy bears, kittens and rabbits are 
predictable favorites, as are names, monograms and smiling faces. 
</P>
<P>
But your choices are hardly limited to the warm and fuzzy. You can buy: 
</P>
<P>
* A picnic pack of stamps -- complete with food, drink, trees and even ants. 
</P>
<P>
* A political slogan, a caricature of George Bush or Mikhail Gorbachev, 
"Boycott Exxon," or "Peace and Freedom in Central America." 
</P>
<P>
* Christians can spread the word with praying hands, doves and "Praise the 
Lord" stamps. 
</P>
<P>
* Southwestern buffs can stamp out cacti, adobes, pottery and the likeness of 
Georgia O'Keeffe. 
</P>
<P>
But the art is in the stamping, not the stamp, so you need an array of 
accessories to make your mark. 
</P>
<P>
First, because every message needs a medium, you must decide what to stamp. 
Your choices include stickers, gift tags, refrigerator magnets, bookmarks, door 
hangers, greeting cards, party hats, ribbons, gift bags, lunch bags and 
stationery and envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the artist can choose from an array of supplies that give color, texture 
and dimension to stamping. Stamp pads range from metallic inks to brilliant 
colors. Glitter glue, watercolor markers, embossing powders, ribbons, flowers 
and jewels complete the polymer palette. 
</P>
<P>
These supplies can be purchased through mail-order catalogues from a number of 
small companies bearing names like Stamp Francisco, the Rubber Room, Repeat 
Business and Bizzaro. Until recently, the dedicated stamper had to shop by 
mail. But of late, Southland retailers have gotten into the stamp act. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Harris, 68, has a collection of more than 12,000 stamps. She makes 
several pilgrimages a year up the coast to Stampa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I bought my stamps and supplies just from catalogues," she said. 
"But when the specialty stamping stores opened, I went hog-wild and crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Also boosting the stamp craze is Rubberstampmadness, a magazine published in 
Ithaca, N.Y. The editor, Roberta Sperling, puts her editorial stamp on her 
publication under the byline Rubberta Stampling. The tabloid includes product 
reviews, personality profiles and design techniques. 
</P>
<P>
The current issue features an article about stamping out stress and another 
that boasts of the therapeutic benefits stamping provides for the criminally 
insane -- and for those who are just a little crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbie Boschan, who owns Stamp Stamp Stamp in Santa Monica Place, suggests that 
stamping may very well be the perfect art form for the '90s. It's fast, it's 
fun, it holds your attention, and it grabs the attention of others. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a hobby that offers instant gratification," Boschan says. "It's not 
like trying to learn the piano." 
</P>
<P>
All in all, stamping is a very stimulating experience, Boschan says. 
</P>
<P>
"Put a rubber stamp down of a bird, and you can make it fly off the page." 
</P>
