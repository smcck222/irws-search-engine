HOSPITAL CONFIRMS MIX-UP; 
</P>
<P>
COUPLE ARE SENT HOME WITH THE WRONG BABY BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two mothers were handed the wrong infants when they left the maternity ward of 
a West Los Angeles hospital after giving birth last month, a spokeswoman for 
the medical facility confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We really don't know" how the mix-up happened, said Michelle Sorey, 
spokeswoman for the Kaiser Permanente Hospital. "That's the question we are all 
asking." 
</P>
<P>
Sorey said blood tests confirmed that Rosetta Kirks, 30, and her husband, Tommy 
Milligan, 47, had been given a baby boy born to another couple, and the second 
family took home the infant Kirks had delivered. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital refused to release the names of the second couple, who have been 
informed of the switch in babies. Both couples were reunited Friday with their 
biological babies. 
</P>
<P>
Sorey said second couple was identified through "a process of elimination" 
using information on medical charts. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's announcement ended days of uncertainty as Kirks faced what may 
be a mother's worst nightmare: For three weeks, she cared for and nurtured the 
newborn she thought was hers -- only to find out that she had the wrong child. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was my baby," Kirks told The Times before learning of the results 
of the blood tests. "I was crazy about him. I'm just confused." 
</P>
<P>
Kirks and Milligan began to suspect something was wrong when the baby they 
called Nicholas seemed smaller than the one Kirks had delivered. And little 
Nicholas did not seem to resemble the photographs that had been taken in the 
delivery room. 
</P>
<P>
Kirks then re-examined the baby's hospital identification bracelet and was 
shocked to see a strange name, said Shelly Shellmire, a spokesman for the 
family's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The baby, it turned out, weighed less and was three inches shorter than 
recorded on the birth certificate, Shellmire said. While it is not unusual for 
a baby to lose weight after birth, the difference in length could not be 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
"The baby just looked smaller and smaller to her," Shellmire said. "In the 
photo, the baby was plump, not the skinny thing she had there with her. . . . 
She got hysterical. They were really upset and didn't know what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
Kirk and Milligan, both of Inglewood, wrestled with their suspicions and fears 
for days before returning the infant to the hospital on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser agreed to conduct blood tests to positively identify the parents of the 
baby and contacted the second couple, who returned to the hospital with their 
infant. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser said an internal investigation is under way. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital was offering psychological counseling to both couples. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very traumatic situation," Sorey said. "Three weeks someone has a baby 
and then to have to relinquish that baby and start to care for one that you 
haven't seen before . . . . That's very traumatic." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Known Mix-Up 
</P>
<P>
This was the first baby mix-up in the hospital's 15-year history, Sorey said. 
She said the hospital has not received telephone calls from other concerned 
mothers since news of the switch was made public. 
</P>
<P>
"The chances of this happening are very slim," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser, which delivers an average of 170 babies a month, follows a standard 
procedure for releasing infants. Newborns are tagged with wrist and ankle 
bracelets, and a third ID bracelet is given to the mother. 
</P>
<P>
Sorey said one of the bracelets is removed from the baby when it is discharged. 
Both mother and nurse are supposed to check the identifications at that moment, 
Sorey said. She said part of the investigation will focus on whether all these 
checks were followed. 
</P>
<P>
Shellmire, who works for Encino attorney Jerome Eisenberg, said Kirks did not 
pay attention to the baby's ID bracelet when she took him home. 
</P>
<P>
"She took the armband off and put it with other baby mementos," he said. Only 
after she became suspicious did she check the armband. 
</P>
<P>
The baby Kirks delivered on Feb. 11 weighed 9 pounds 3 ounces and measured 21 
1/2 inches. The baby she took home was 4 pounds lighter and measured only 18 
inches, Shellmire said. 
</P>
<P>
"You know a baby's not going to shrink. It may lose weight, but it won't 
shrink," he said. Shellmire said Kirks and Milligan plan to sue the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to standard blood tests, the hospital used chromosome studies and 
DNA "fingerprinting" to confirm the babies' parentage. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles County social worker who was called in on the case said both 
babies appeared healthy and in good condition as they were restored to their 
rightful parents.

WIFE OF VINCENNES SKIPPER ESCAPES BOMBING IN S.D.

<TEXT>
<P>
The wife of Capt. Will Rogers III, skipper of the San Diego-based guided 
missile cruiser Vincennes, escaped unharmed Friday morning, moments before a 
pipe bomb exploded under her van, igniting a fire that gutted her vehicle at a 
busy La Jolla intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after the 7:40 a.m. explosion, the FBI took control of the investigation, 
suspecting that the bombing might be an act of "domestic terrorism" linked to 
the Vincennes' accidental downing of an Iranian civilian airliner in the 
Persian Gulf last July. The Navy and Marine Corps tightened security at every 
military installation in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly it raises the question whether there was a terrorist group involved 
in this," said Gary Laturno, an FBI spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility for the bombing, a federal law enforcement 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point in time, we have no motive; we have no suspect," said Thomas A. 
Hughes, special agent in charge of the FBI in San Diego. "We do not rule out 
the possibility of retribution against Capt. Rogers." 
</P>
<P>
However, a senior Defense Department official said there was "no evidence" of a 
terrorist connection Friday, and some law enforcement officials described the 
bombing as "amateurish." 
</P>
<P>
An FBI spokesman said the Rogers' van was usually driven by Sharon Rogers, but 
two highly placed law enforcement sources told The Times that Capt. Rogers 
drove his wife's van to a doughnut shop without incident about an hour before 
the blast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stopped at Light 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred while the van was in the left-turn lane of northbound 
Genesee Avenue, just south of La Jolla Village Drive and next to University 
Towne Centre. A law enforcement official, who asked not to be identified, said 
Sharon Rogers told investigators that she pulled up behind three or four cars 
stopped at the red light, then heard two popping sounds. 
</P>
<P>
The official said she believed that her van had been struck in the rear by 
another car, so she got out and walked to the back of the van to look for 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
"And then it all went up," the official said. "That's all there was to it. 
There were holes everywhere, and there was plenty of burn." 
</P>
<P>
The explosion propelled metal fragments through the roof of the white Toyota 
and ignited a fire that gutted the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
One law enforcement source said several construction workers nearby reported 
that, moments after the explosion, a red car quickly made a U-turn over the 
traffic median on Genesee and sped from the scene, headed south. Witnesses said 
there were four people in the red car. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have been a guy with a remote-control device who popped the bomb," 
the source said, "or it could have been somebody who saw the explosion and was 
trying not to get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers, 50, was on her way to her job as a fourth-grade teacher at La 
Jolla Country Day School when the bomb detonated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others Escape Damage 
</P>
<P>
Though there were other vehicles on three sides of the van, none was damaged, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe she got out just as it blew," said Kurt Lent, a laborer who was 
walking down a dirt embankment toward the vehicle as it exploded. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers was dazed, but walking under her own power, when the laborers 
reached her. They took her to a pickup truck, where she told them that she was 
the van's sole occupant and she asked them to call her husband. Will Rogers 
arrived at the scene within minutes, and police took the couple to the San 
Diego Police Department's Northern Division headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"She looked like she'd just been rear-ended or something," said Charles Archer, 
one of two masonry workers to reach Rogers first. "She was surprised and 
shocked, but she wasn't burned and she wasn't bleeding." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police and FBI agents rushed to the Rogers' Sherlock Court home, 
checking two other vehicles and the house with dogs trained to sniff for 
explosives. Investigators used mirrors to look beneath the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Husband Used Van 
</P>
<P>
Two law enforcement sources said Will Rogers left the couple's home about 6:30 
a.m. and drove in the van to a doughnut shop. He returned, drank coffee with 
his wife, and then Sharon Rogers, who usually drove the van, left in the 
vehicle, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
When Sharon Rogers was interviewed, one law enforcement source said, she was 
nervous and shaken, but she did not immediately connect the explosion with any 
possible retaliation for her husband's role in shooting down the Iranian plane. 
</P>
<P>
The official also said that the van had been parked in the driveway overnight 
but that neither the Rogerses nor any neighbors reported seeing anyone near it. 
He also said the Rogerses have a family watchdog. 
</P>
<P>
"The dog didn't bark, and the dog barks at everybody," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said Sharon Rogers told investigators that her family had received no 
threats since the airplane was downed. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no threats, nothing," he said. "That's what's funny. If you're 
getting telephone calls in the middle of the night and threatening letters and 
graffiti, you would worry. But here there was nothing." 
</P>
<P>
The Rogerses were being protected Friday night by the Naval Investigative 
Service and other Navy personnel at an undisclosed location. "They are not home 
and we will not disclose their location," said Chief Petty Officer Craig 
Huebler, a Navy spokesman. "And we won't discuss it beyond that. That gets into 
security, and you can understand the sensitivity to that." 
</P>
<P>
He said that no special security precautions were undertaken for Rogers, the 
crew members or their families after the Vincennes returned to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should the Vincennes crew be treated any different?" Huebler said. "There 
was nothing to indicate a threat to the crew or to their families." 
</P>
<P>
All 360 sailors assigned to the Vincennes were alerted by the Navy after the 
bombing and were urged to take whatever precautions they deemed necessary, 
Huebler said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and Navy officials said that Capt. Rogers and his wife telephoned their 
son, Bill Rogers, at Colgate University, where he is a student. They assured 
him they were safe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Declined Comment 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday the FBI declined comment on most aspects of the investigation. But 
two law enforcement sources said one or two pipe bombs had been placed under 
the van on the transmission. 
</P>
<P>
"If she didn't get out like that . . . well, she was very, very lucky," said 
one source. 
</P>
<P>
He said he and other investigators determined that the two initial loud bangs 
apparently came from one or two explosive devices and that the apparatus was 
connected under the van's transmission. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that most of the van's damage resulted from the fire, which he said 
has led investigators to believe that either low-intensity explosives were 
planted on the vehicle, or that only a small amount of high-intensity 
explosives was used. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours, San Diego Fire Department officials confirmed that the blast was 
caused by a pipe bomb. Archer said he found a flattened, 2-by-3-inch section of 
metal pipe near the curb and turned it over to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the FBI; the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms; the Naval Investigative Service; the San Diego Police Department; the 
San Diego Fire Department and the San Diego County Sheriff's Department swarmed 
over the scene, searching for evidence within a grid chalk-marked on the 
pavement around the van. 
</P>
<P>
Although two investigative sources said the device was planted on the 
transmission, the FBI's Hughes said at a news conference that "an explosive 
device exploded in the vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they plan to keep the site of the bombing sealed off until at 
least 4 p.m. today. The evidence will be reviewed by federal bomb and 
anti-terrorist experts from the Department of Justice headquarters in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low Intensity 
</P>
<P>
Two terrorism experts acknowledged that terrorists, like those operating in the 
Middle East, commonly use higher-intensity explosives. They said they could not 
rule out the possibility that the attack was ordered by Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"I would expect the Iranians to come better-equipped, but it's not unheard-of 
for terrorists to use pipe bombs," said UC San Diego Prof. John Ruggie, a 
consultant on terrorism for the federal government and the United Nations. "One 
example is the attack on U. S. servicemen in Germany." In that attack, two 
soldiers and a woman patron of a nightclub were killed and 200 people were 
injured in West Berlin in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism specialist with the RAND Corp. in Santa Monica, said 
he has interviewed terrorists trained in Lebanon who said they were under 
orders to use low-intensity explosives, like pipe bombs, when hitting foreign 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
The Vincennes, a guided-missile cruiser based in San Diego, returned from its 
six-month Persian Gulf deployment in October. It remains in port with Rogers as 
its skipper. 
</P>
<P>
As the Vincennes exchanged fire with Iranian speedboats last July 3, Iran Air 
Flight 655 appeared on the U. S. warship's high-tech radar system. After the 
plane failed to respond to warnings on civilian and military channels, Rogers 
gave the order to fire. 
</P>
<P>
That decision, he said later, was in defense of his ship and crew. But the 
aircraft that Rogers feared was an Iranian F-14 fighter was actually an Airbus 
A300 with 290 people aboard. All of them were killed when the plane was knocked 
out of the air by a missile launched from the Vincennes. 
</P>
<P>
After the downing of the plane, Iran said it would seek retribution for the 
deaths of the innocent civilians. 
</P>
<P>
However, Navy spokesmen in San Diego said Friday that no threats had been made 
against Rogers, the Vincennes or any of its crew members since the ship 
returned to San Diego. The Vincennes and Rogers received some "negative" mail 
last July, shortly after the plane was shot down, a spokesman said. That mail 
was critical of the Vincennes' handling of the incident but did not contain 
threats, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Vincennes returned to San Diego, Rogers has been overseeing routine 
ship maintenance and training in preparation for its next deployment. The Navy 
does not disclose the dates that any of its ships will be deployed, but surface 
ships normally work in 18-month cycles, spending about six months at sea and 
the rest of the time at or near their home ports. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials in Los Angeles said Friday that an FBI lookout report was 
issued in San Diego in late December for a Syrian national allegedly linked to 
the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 259 passengers and crew 
members in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
A copy of the FBI document, obtained by The Times, said the Los Angeles FBI 
office had received an anonymous phone call alleging that the Syrian, 
identified as Farwan Abdin, was "involved in or responsible for the Flight 103 
crash in Scotland." 
</P>
<P>
The FBI added: "Also mentioned were Navy quarters or TV station. No further 
information given." 
</P>
<P>
The FBI's assessment at the time was that the call was "shoddy" but that 
efforts should be made to locate Abdin. Officials said Friday that a serious 
investigation of the call was never launched. 
</P>
<P>
Terrorism experts believe the bombing of Pan American Flight 103 over Scotland 
may have been retribution for the Vincennes' shooting down of the Iranian 
jetliner. But no organization that authorities thought capable of the act has 
claimed responsibility for the Dec. 21 bombing of the Pan Am aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have said that, if retribution for the Iranian Airbus downing is 
the motive, a group responsible may not feel it necessary to proclaim its role; 
the retribution itself could carry the message.

<P>
An Air Ontario Fokker F-28 jet plane with 61 people on board crashed shortly 
after takeoff Friday in a wooded area covered with snow near here, and 
provincial police constable William Bradshaw said rescuers using snowmobiles 
and sleds found 46 survivors. 
</P>
<P>
At least one person died in the crash and 14 people were still unaccounted for 
late Friday, Bradshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
"The aircraft caught fire after impact and that has delayed rescue procedures," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue operations stopped for the night and will resume at first light, Hugh 
Syrja, spokesman for Dryden's emergency rescue group, said. 
</P>
<P>
Forty of the survivors were taken to Dryden District General Hospital for 
treatment of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch-built aircraft, a twin-engine jet, was carrying 57 passengers and a 
crew of four, officials said. Initially they had reported 69 people were on 
board. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, Air Ontario's Flight 363 en route from Thunder Bay, Ontario, to 
Winnipeg, Manitoba, had just taken off after a scheduled stop in this Ontario 
farming town about 85 miles north of the U.S.-Canadian frontier when the crash 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
The jet clipped treetops and exploded, witnesses and authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Saville, general manager of the weekly Dryden Observer, said that 
the plane crashed about three-quarters of a mile from the runway. 
</P>
<P>
"They got them out by snow machine and sled, since there are no roads there," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers used chain saws to cut through the woods to the site of the crash, and 
bulldozers later cleared a rough road into the area. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue spokesman Syrja said that show machines were used to carry casualties 
from the crash scene to the roadway where ambulances took them to the hospital 
in Dryden, a town of about 6,500 population on the Trans-Canada Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Not long after the crash, Saville reported that "you can see smoke from two 
miles away. When it came down, there was smoke." 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Borden, who lives near the airport, said: "I just went out to start my 
car. I heard it (the jet), then I didn't hear it any more." 
</P>
<P>
After the crash, she said "there was just a blue haze all over the place, 
around the trees and stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Roxanne Groves, a nearby resident, heard the aircraft fly overhead. 
</P>
<P>
"It was rumbling really bad," she said. "It didn't sound normal, and then all 
of a sudden, we heard a thump, a good thump. I looked out about five minutes 
later and there was black smoke all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cut Half-Mile Swath 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers said that the plane cut a swath half a mile long and about 100 feet 
wide. 
</P>
<P>
Dryden hospital spokesman Dennis Belleville said the survivors suffered from 
burns, fractures and shock. He said the more seriously injured would be flown 
to Winnipeg and Thunder Bay, and that some of the victims were being discharged 
from the hospital Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Belleville said the coroner went to the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
James Harris, spokesman for the Canadian Aviation Safety Board, said that 
airline and safety board teams were traveling to Dryden from Winnipeg, Toronto 
and Ottawa to try to determine the cause of the crash. Other officials said 
that the weather was bad at the time of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"The weather . . . was heavy snow and poor visibility, less than 1 mile, closer 
to half to three-quarters of a mile," said Norm Pascoe, spokesman for Transport 
Canada, the government transportation agency in Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
An Air Ontario spokesman said the plane was owned by the French airline TAT and 
was leased by the Canadian airline last year. McKnight of Air Ontario said that 
the plane was about 16 years old. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first fatal crash involving a regularly scheduled commercial 
airliner in Canada in 10 years. In 1979, 17 people were killed in Quebec City 
when a Quebecair Fairchild 27 went down. 
</P>
<P>
The worst air disaster in Canada occurred in 1985, when 256 people, mainly 
American servicemen, died in the crash of a chartered DC-8 in Gander, 
Newfoundland.

Donna Ashlock was laid to rest Friday in a pink casket adorned with roses as 
family and friends mourned the teen-ager whose heart, transplanted from a 
youthful admirer, finally gave out. 
</P>
<P>
Donna, 17, had told her parents she wanted a pink casket like one at the recent 
funeral of a family friend, so they ordered a duplicate after she died on 
Tuesday while awaiting a new heart, her father, Raymond, said.

An overflow crowd -- many of them high school friends -- spilled onto the 
sidewalk for a full block in front of Hillview Funeral Chapel. Those outside, 
under a partially overcast sky, were told they could view the open casket after 
the service before interment at Patterson District Cemetery. Six policemen in 
blue dress uniforms served as pallbearers. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Paul Flyfleet, pastor of the Assembly of God Church in Hilmar, thanked 
God "for the impact she has made on other people's lives, her courage and her 
strength." 
</P>
<P>
Following the hymn "I'm Sheltered in the Arms of God," Flyfleet described 
Donna's life since her heart transplant three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"She was just a normal, active, loving teen-ager, but she was a teen-ager with 
great courage," Flyfleet said. "Twelve times she was in the hospital in San 
Francisco. When I talked to her, never did she complain about her situation."

R. MAPPLETHORPE; PHOTOGRAPHER KNOWN FOR WIDE-RANGING WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Robert Mapplethorpe, praised as much for his exquisite photographs of flowers 
as for his fetishistic portrayals of erotica, died Thursday of AIDS-related 
complications at New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston, a spokeswoman for 
his gallery said. He was 43. 
</P>
<P>
Mapplethorpe was diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome more than a 
year ago and was in Boston for a special treatment when his condition worsened 
unexpectedly, said Susan Arthur of the Robert Miller Gallery in New York City, 
which represented him. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the world of classic beauty and the arena of sadomasochism that 
Mapplethorpe bisected throughout his short career, Los Angeles Times art writer 
Suzanne Muchnic in 1982 said that Mapplethorpe's oeuvre "confuses expectation 
because it is a scattershop assortment of everything from delicate romance and 
good humor to brutal titillation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Extraordinary Talent' 
</P>
<P>
"The artist who emerges seems to have an extraordinary talent and a 
dehumanizing sensibility." 
</P>
<P>
Mapplethorpe, who was about to publish two new books of his work, was probably 
best known for the controversy surrounding his homosexual-oriented photographs 
of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
His favorite medium was black and white but he also experimented some with 
color. Most of his pictures, whether of people or things, are lighted and 
photographed so they appear as sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to be written about as a normal artist," Mapplethorpe once told 
American Photographer magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"I never wanted to be a photographer," he said. "It was sort of a mistake 
really. I only wanted to make a statement and photography ended up being the 
vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
Last August, New York's Whitney Museum of American Art featured him in a 
one-man show with 100 of his works. The New York weekly 7 Days reported that 
Mapplethorpe, visibly suffering from AIDS, appeared at the opening, "dapper but 
visibly frail." 
</P>
<P>
"For an hour he was propped up on a couch . . . surrounded by his pictures. 
Then, when the crush of well-wishers made the place too steamy, he was whisked 
away." 
</P>
<P>
The photographer's recent work reflected his illness, Arthur said. 
</P>
<P>
"His pictures now were about what he was experiencing. That he was fighting 
dying makes them that much more timely in this age of AIDS," Arthur said. 
</P>
<P>
His self-portraits, published last year, show his once-attractive features 
drawn and emaciated. Many are now on view in an exhibition at the Museum of 
Contemporary Art in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Often-Bleak Photographs 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1946, the son of an electrical engineer and raised in a middle-class, 
Catholic home in Floral Park, N.Y., Mapplethorpe took to Manhattan's 42nd 
Street in the 1960s seeking subjects for what would become his often-bleak 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, he enrolled at the Pratt Institute, one of New York's top art schools, 
and studied there for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
He emerged in the mid-1970s as part of an offbeat culture that included 
longtime friend and rock singer Patti Smith. He worked in several media, 
including collage and film. 
</P>
<P>
His subject matter ranged from sexual taboos to traditional still lifes to 
commercial advertising to fashion and album covers. At his death, he had 
published 20 books and his pictures were commanding high prices. 
</P>
<P>
When the mid-1970s gave way to New Wave rock 'n' roll, Mapplethorpe presented 
ascetic album covers for the recordings of Smith and the group Television. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the mid-1970s, he began working as a staff photographer for Andy 
Warhol's Interview magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Between rock 'n' roll albums and his nudes of male athletes, he produced 
flattering portraits of John Paul Getty III, Arnold Schwarzenegger, composer 
Philip Glass and writer Susan Sontag. Another was of art curator and collector 
Sam Wagstaff, his longtime companion, who died of AIDS in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
(Wagstaff's vast collection was purchased by the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu 
in 1984.) 
</P>
<P>
His successes mounted and by 1987, Mapplethorpe's linen prints were being sold 
for as much as $15,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to get a picture that is the way I want to remember someone. It's like 
a diary in the end," Mapplethorpe once said. "My work is about order. I am a 
perfectionist." 
</P>
<P>
Mapplethorpe is survived by his father and mother, two sisters and two 
brothers.

SAM MELVILLE, 52; ACTOR CO-STARRED IN 'ROOKIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sam Melville, the ruggedly handsome co-star of TV's popular but short-lived 
series "The Rookies," died Thursday night at his Hollywood Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
His friend and publicist, Susan Patricola, said the cause of death evidently 
was heart failure but that he "was an athlete who was the picture of health." 
Melville, 52, complained of chest pains some weeks ago, she added, but tests at 
the time indicated that he was fine. 
</P>
<P>
The pains continued and he was scheduled to undergo further examination when 
his wife discovered his body. An autopsy is pending. 
</P>
<P>
From its inception in September, 1972, until the series went off the air in 
June, 1976, Melville portrayed Officer Mike Danko, one of three green and 
idealistic cops dedicated to more humane methods of police work. The show 
revolved around the conflict their methods evoked in their more traditional 
superiors. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Melville had been a regular guest star in the old "Gunsmoke" series. 
In films he had been seen as Dave in 1968's "The Thomas Crown Affair." 
</P>
<P>
His other television appearances included the miniseries "Roughnecks" and as 
the ex-husband of Amanda King (Kate Jackson) in "Scarecrow and Mrs. King" 
(1983-87). 
</P>
<P>
His last films were "Fists of Steel" and "Assassination With Cause." 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Annie, with whom he played in the local rock band 
"Alias," his mother, father and two sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Services are scheduled Wednesday at 9:30 a.m. at Forest Lawn, Burbank.

KERMIT BEAHAN; U.S. FLIER WHO DROPPED A-BOMB

<P>
Kermit Beahan, the bombardier who dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki and then 
said he wanted the distinction of being the last man ever to use that 
devastation on humans, has died after suffering cardiac arrest. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
Beahan died Thursday, a day after he underwent prostate surgery in a hospital 
in Nassau Bay, Tex., near his home in suburban Clear Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Beahan flew on both the missions that unleashed atomic weapons on Japan forcing 
its surrender. He was aboard The Great Artiste, a B-29 bomber that bore his 
nickname -- a sobriquet he was given because of his bombing skill -- when it 
was an escort for the Enola Gay, which dropped the atomic bomb "Little Boy" on 
Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drops 'Fat Man' Bomb 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, Beahan dropped the "Fat Man" bomb on Nagasaki. It was his 
27th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews over the years and as recently as 1985, on the 40th anniversary 
of the bombing, he said he would never apologize for the bombing, adding that 
25 Japanese sought him out a few years ago and told him the two drops were the 
"best way out of a hell of a mess." 
</P>
<P>
But he said he hoped to be the last man ever to drop such a bomb on people. 
</P>
<P>
Five days after the Nagasaki bombing, which killed an estimated 73,000 people, 
Japan surrendered. The Hiroshima bomb had killed about 71,000. 
</P>
<P>
Beahan was attending Rice University on a football scholarship when World War 
II intervened. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hoped to Be Pilot 
</P>
<P>
He joined the U.S. Army Air Corps, hoping to be a pilot, but became a 
bombardier after "washing out" of pilot training. 
</P>
<P>
He took part in 40 missions over Europe, including the first B-17 raids. His 
B-17 unit was commanded by Paul W. Tibbets, who later assembled the team that 
dropped the two atom bombs on Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Beahan recalled the Nagasaki bombing in an interview with the Houston 
Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a mushroom cloud bubbling and flashing orange, red and green," Beahan 
said. "It looked like a picture of hell. The ground itself was covered by a 
rolling black smoke. I was told the area would be destroyed, but I didn't know 
the meaning of an atomic bomb." 
</P>
<P>
Beahan retired from the Air Force as a lieutenant colonel in 1963 and worked 
for Brown &amp; Root Inc. as a technical writer until he retired in 1985.

<TEXT>
<P>
Theologian Hans Kung, who will be in Southern California next week to take part 
in a Christian-Buddhist dialogue and to publicize a new book, will give a 
public lecture Thursday night in Claremont as part of another scholarly 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Kung, an outspoken professor at the University of Tubingen, West Germany, who 
has engaged in theological disputes with the Vatican, will talk about a 
cross-denominational model for Christianity under the title: "Religion in the 
Post-modern Age." The lecture, at 7:30 p.m., will be held in the Mudd 
Auditorium of the School of Theology at Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
The event is part of the joint regional meetings of the Society of Biblical 
Literature and the American Academy of Religion. The meetings begin Thursday 
afternoon and end Saturday. Robert Ellwood, chairman of USC's School of 
Religion, will give a plenary address 11 a.m. Friday on his recently published 
theory about evolutionary stages of major world religions. 
</P>
<P>
Kung co-authored, with Julia Ching of the University of Toronto, "Christianity 
and the Chinese Religions," to be published next week by Doubleday. 
</P>
<P>
He will be among a select number of Christian and Buddhist scholars who will 
take part in the fifth and possibly final Christian-Buddhist theological 
dialogue from Friday through Monday, March 20, at the new Hsi Lai Buddhist 
Temple in Hacienda Heights. In a separate engagement, Kung will give a talk at 
7 p.m. next Saturday at Westwood Hills Christian Church in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian-Buddhist dialogue will end March 20 with a lecture by Jeffrey 
Hopkins, a religion professor at the University of Virginia. His talk, about 
Tibetan Buddhism as a religious option, will be at 7:30 p.m. in Claremont 
Graduate School's Albrecht Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAY 
</P>
<P>
At sundown Sunday and in services Monday, the Lenten period will begin for 
Eastern Orthodox faithful, who celebrate Easter on April 30 this year. Western 
Christianity, which calculates the date for Easter differently, will observe 
the holiday on March 26. For Eastern Orthodox Christians, the first Sunday of 
Lent, March 19, is an important date because it also commemorates the return of 
icons to church worship in AD 843 after they were banned in the previous 
century. 
</P>
<P>
ACTION 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by "AIDS Masses" and similar Christian services for those afflicted 
with the fatal disease, Reform Jewish leaders have planned a community service 
of "remembrance, healing and hope" for 4:30 p.m. Sunday at Leo Baeck Temple in 
West Los Angeles. The sermon will be given by Rabbi Alexander Schindler of New 
York, president of Reform Judaism's Union of American Hebrew Congregations 
since 1973. The service is an outgrowth of a regional AIDS committee designed 
to help Reform congregations formulate policies on employees who contract AIDS 
and how to lend support to afflicted people. 
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 members of the Los Angeles Stake, or region, of the Mormon 
Church were expected to participate today in a disaster drill that assumes 
telephone lines have been knocked out. Bishops of the nine congregations will 
be told the circumstances at 9 a.m. and asked to use other communications over 
the next two hours. "We will plant messages with certain families saying that 
there is a gas leak in their homes, or that a family member needs medical 
attention," said Lynn O. Poulson, a Los Angeles Mormon leader. The Mormon 
Church, which faced great adversity in its early history, has long preached 
preparedness and cooperation in emergencies among its membership. 
</P>
<P>
DATES 
</P>
<P>
Penny Lernoux, a one-time city editor of the Daily Trojan, will lecture on 
Catholicism's struggles in Latin America at 6 p.m. Monday at USC's Taper Hall. 
Now Latin American affairs writer for the National Catholic Reporter, she has 
written her third book, "People of God," to be published this year by 
Viking-Penguin. 
</P>
<P>
A four-part film series on Gnosticism, a religious movement of the early 
Christian era that was later branded a heresy, will be shown by its British 
film maker, Stephen Segaller, next Saturday at the NuArt Theater in West Los 
Angeles. Segaller said he will introduce each segment of the 
"semi-dramatization" of Gnostic influences through the ages. The program, 
lasting from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., will cost $37.50. 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Timothy Manning, 79, took the microphone in hand and sang a couple of 
Irish melodies for the audience at an early St. Patrick's Day parish party late 
last week at Holy Family Catholic Church in South Pasadena. Msgr. Clement J. 
Connolly, the pastor at Holy Family and former secretary to Manning when he was 
archbishop of Los Angeles, also contributed vocal solos. The cardinal resides 
at the parish rectory. JOHN DART

FREE ELECTIONS FOR POLAND? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I am old enough to have seen democratic elections. I want to see them again." 
With those plaintive but hopeful words, opposition leader Bronislaw Geremek has 
greeted the tentative understanding reached with Poland's Communist Party to 
create a new national two-house legislature, many of whose members would be 
freely elected. Not since 1946 have anything like free elections been permitted 
in Poland; only a minority of the population can remember a time when a choice 
among parties and candidates was allowed. A majority of Poles probably long ago 
gave up any expectation such a time would come again. Now that prospect seems 
tantalizingly close to realization. The first democratic national elections in 
the Communist bloc could come as early as June 4. 
</P>
<P>
All this depends on what finally emerges from the negotiations that have been 
going on since Feb. 6 about what political changes should take place in Poland. 
So far, tentative agreement has been reached to restore the banned trade union 
Solidarity, the farmers' union and the Independent Students' Assn. Agreement 
also has been reached to establish a president with strong powers, who would be 
chosen by a majority of both chambers of parliament. Solidarity officials have 
already all but conceded the presidency to Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who has 
ruled Poland since 1981. The entire package of changes must be adopted before 
any one of them can take effect. 
</P>
<P>
What the opposition is now pushing for is free elections at the local level, 
along with access by non-Communist elements to the mass media and freedom for 
them to create independent associations. Acceptance by the regime of these 
steps, which is by no means assured, would mark an unprecedented leap forward. 
</P>
<P>
What the reforms that have so far been provisionally agreed to indicate is how 
desperate the regime has become as it faces the challenges of a sick and 
steadily weakening economy and an increasingly hostile and restive population. 
In an effort to mobilize popular support, if not behind its leaders then at 
least behind its efforts at national revival, Poland's Communist Party seems 
prepared to accept a diminution of its authoritarian powers that would 
effectively give the country the broadest-based government in the Communist 
bloc. What may be developing is a degree of change that is nothing short of 
revolutionary in its implications, for Poland certainly, and perhaps for other 
Eastern Europe countries as well.

AN EXERCISE IN LEAPING TO CONCLUSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED HOTALING, Ed Hotaling is a television news producer in Washington and a 
commentator on the NBC Radio Network. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It has been erroneously reported," the newspaper correction advised, "that Ed 
Hotaling, the TV reporter who did the infamous interview with Jimmy (the Greek) 
Snyder . . . is black." Other major newspapers had made the same mistake, but 
few bothered to correct it. Indeed, the error had a vast audience, thereby 
giving the interviewer -- me -- the instructive privilege of being black for 
most of 1988 and into 1989. 
</P>
<P>
I got to be a superstar, almost, launched by an editorial in the Philadelphia 
Inquirer. It noted that the Greek, then a commentator for CBS Sports, had said 
those now-famous silly things -- for instance, that blacks had been bred during 
slavery and thus were better athletes today -- to a black television reporter. 
The editorial writer pointed out that the network's white brass was "far more 
outraged than Messrs. Cosby or Jackson or, for that matter, Ed Hotaling, who 
conducted the interview." 
</P>
<P>
Some odd things happened after that. People started talking funny. 
</P>
<P>
When the interview made the network newscasts, calls came from around the 
country. A white editor on a great newspaper kept complimenting me. His lavish 
words were echoed by a white reporter for another big paper. They both said 
that I had been "verrry calm, verrry level-headed, verrry professional 
throughout the whooole thing." 
</P>
<P>
What, I wondered, was going on? Why were they talking as if I were 12? Did they 
think I was interning with "Children's Express"? 
</P>
<P>
That was before I knew I was black. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, we get that all the time," one black TV anchor explained. 
</P>
<P>
Whites sometimes do talk differently to blacks. If you're white, you know that, 
but have you felt it? This particular mix-up reminded a black commentator that 
when she was first hired as a reporter, the white news director sat her down 
and said, "Remember, you have to be a reporter first . . . and a black person 
second." She was nearly speechless. You can imagine managers saying that, but 
not to a white. 
</P>
<P>
Whites rushed to praise me. An Arizona caller said it was wonderful that, in 
spite of what the Greek had said, I had been so tolerant, defending his right 
to free speech. I told the caller that I was white. The conversation pretty 
much ended there. 
</P>
<P>
Why did people assume that a black reporter's reaction would be racial? A 
number of blacks told me they thought the Greek should have been fired; a 
number disagreed. But many whites took it for granted that black reaction would 
be uniformly hostile and unforgiving. Exceptions brought sighs of relief, 
cross-country bouquets and, in the case of Messrs. Cosby and Jackson, banner 
headlines in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, my new role was uncomfortable. A writer for a monthly magazine 
phoned long after the interview and wondered, apologetically, if I were black. 
I hated to stonewall a fellow reporter, but now it seemed irrelevant. I told 
him I didn't care to say. He apologized again. It felt right, but rotten. 
</P>
<P>
Why did they assume that the interviewer was black? The apparent answer is 
simple and sad. I'd run into Jimmy the Greek while I was working on a Martin 
Luther King Day story, asking people about the decline of civil rights as an 
issue. These days, I learned, if you're interested in civil rights, you must be 
black. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when a paper in Upstate New York got the UPI text of the interview, which 
began with the question, "Do you think there's anything we still need to do, or 
do you think we don't need to worry about civil rights anymore?" an editor 
inserted "blacks" in parentheses after "we." Who else would ask that? 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, almost nobody. Not only do many Americans today see civil rights as a 
minority interest, they also remember King as a special-interest advocate. 
</P>
<P>
Two decades after King's death, his opponents live in the woodwork. The day the 
Greek lost his job for saying something stupid, a Pennsylvania disc jockey lost 
his by announcing King Day in racist terms. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not only in the gutter that many recall King exclusively as a black 
leader, the way many conclude that only a black reporter would be assigned to a 
civil-rights story. At a Washington dinner of veteran journalists, all white, I 
remarked that I was surprised so many people still view King strictly as a 
black hero. Hundreds of thousands of whites had supported him; Europeans had 
given him the Nobel Prize. 
</P>
<P>
They looked at each other, a little startled. It was clear I was the one out of 
step. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's what he was," some brilliant somebody said, as the others nodded in 
agreement, "a black leader." 
</P>
<P>
It was good to feel black again.

CATCHING A CURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every few years, some backyard inventor triumphantly reveals that he has built 
a perpetual motion machine, and every few years someone claims to have found a 
cure for the common cold. Serious people long ago learned to respond to such 
announcements with a certain degree of caution, most appropriately expressed in 
the form of utter disbelief. The perpetual motion machine, a hypothetical 
device that would run on forever and defy the known laws of physics by creating 
more energy than it dissipates, still awaits its discoverer. Now, though, 
medical science seems to have been brought a significant step closer to finding 
a way to prevent, if not cure, a lot of common colds. 
</P>
<P>
Two groups of researchers, working independently, have identified a molecule in 
nasal cells through which some cold-causing viruses enter the body. That 
breakthrough expands understanding of how viruses are able to evade or overcome 
the body's formidable defense mechanisms so that they can set about producing 
misery. The molecules on the surface of nasal cells, called receptors, are now 
seen as providing a specific entryway. Researchers think that by cloning these 
receptors and administering them through nasal spray or nose drops to people at 
the risk of catching cold, it may be possible to confuse or tie up invading 
viruses and so prevent infection. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists caution that a practical anti-cold medicine is at best years away 
even from being tested in humans, and major questions remain about the costs 
and general effectiveness of such an approach. Still, there is understandable 
excitement among researchers. The common cold represents an enormous health and 
economic drain. Nearly 100 million disabling colds occur each year, producing 
more than 295 million days of restricted activity, more than 35 million days 
absent from work and about 45 million days of lost schooling. The cost in lost 
wages and productivity runs into the billions. About $2 billion more is spent 
each year on cough and cold medicines. Cold researchers aren't promising fast, 
fast, fast relief, but they are holding out the hope that misery can eventually 
be reduced. A world waiting for the chance to be grateful wishes them well.

If bilingual teaching has proven to make a positive difference then our schools 
should have it. But why pay up to $5,000 a year more to just these teachers? 
Instead, let's raise the salaries of all L.A. teachers to the point where Los 
Angeles attracts the best and keeps the best!

SECOND AMENDMENT AND GUN CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the editorial, The Times stated its support for a bill which allows people 
to own weapons in part that "are more than adequate . . . to have the fun of 
killing game animals. . . ." Few people (The Times included, apparently) 
question the notion that killing animals is fun, but I believe it represents an 
arrogant and repugnant side of human character. 
</P>
<P>
Today most people would be repulsed by the idea of killing human beings for 
fun, but the Romans and Nazis had no problem with it. Killing for fun requires 
the greatest insensitivity to life and a callous indifference to suffering. 
</P>
<P>
The killing of any animal for fun should be strictly prohibited. We should 
recognize target shooting as an appropriate outlet for this murderous instinct, 
just as arena sports have become our civilized version of the Roman Coliseum 
blood baths.

CONTROVERSY OVER BILINGUAL EDUCATION IN L.A. SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a bilingual classroom teacher I feel the need to address the issues raised 
in this article. The workload alone involved in teaching in a bilingual 
classroom merits higher pay; in addition, bilingual teachers must be proficient 
in two languages and have an understanding of the different backgrounds of the 
linguistic minority children they teach. 
</P>
<P>
Too many teachers who embrace "English-only" don't know the first thing about 
language acquisition or ESL teaching techniques. They are ill-equipped to teach 
language minority children even if California adopted English immersion rather 
than bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
It's time that we in California face the fact that changing demographics 
require that teachers meet the needs of non-English-speaking children. Isn't 
this, after all, the primary reason for being a teacher?

SECOND AMENDMENT AND GUN CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the drive began in earnest to ban military assaults weapons, the anti-gun 
control people would have the public believe that there is no way laws can be 
written to differentiate between a military weapon like the AK-47 and 
semiautomatic sport rifles. This is just a smoke screen by the anti-gun control 
people who do not want any gun-control laws no matter how desperately needed 
they are. There are obvious criteria for telling the two types of weapons 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
Intent of design should be one criteria. A weapon originally designed to be 
fired automatically -- or even at a high rate of speed semiautomatically -- and 
accommodate a clip with a large number of rounds -- is obviously a military 
weapon and ought to be banned from the public. 
</P>
<P>
Such a ban would not infringe on the rights of hunters whose first priority is 
accuracy and, of course, there are already laws on the books limiting the 
number of rounds a rifle or shotgun can carry. So where is the conflict between 
sport rifles and shotguns and military weapons? The sooner the military weapons 
are banned the better.

ARCHBISHOP'S JET HELICOPTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The expenditure of $395,000 to buy a jet helicopter for the personal use of 
Archbishop Roger Mahony is sacrilegious, regardless of whether the money was 
donated ("Gift of Helicopter Will Keep Archbishop Mahony Above the Fray," 
Metro, Feb. 26). 
</P>
<P>
I am a Catholic who attends church weekly. In view of the fact that we are 
asked almost every week to contribute to the needs of the church -- including 
the missions, the poor, the homeless, the schools, the stewardship and the 
Christmas decorating fund -- his actions are wasteful, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
Couldn't these funds be used in a more constructive and humane way? 
</P>
<P>
I sympathize with the archbishop wanting to avoid traffic congestion. That's a 
problem that all of his flock deal with daily. Is he above it? 
</P>
<P>
The archbishop should keep his feet on the ground. If the hustle and bustle of 
traffic are too nerve-wracking for him, I'm sure many parishioners would 
volunteer to be his chauffeur.

<P>
While we are fully aware of the good works, and donations, made by Richard 
Riordan and his contemporaries, we feel compelled to make a comment on the gift 
of a helicopter to Archbishop Mahony. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that the archbishop will use it to "avoid traffic congestion," we find 
it ironic that just last month the parents of students in one of the poorest 
parish schools in Los Angeles were told that their monthly tuition needs to be 
raised by $15 a month next school year. The parents, many of whom work two and 
three jobs now, were told that we all need to make sacrifices for the sake of 
education. Where is the sacrifice on the part of the church leadership?

SUSPENDED OFFICER FACES HEARING ON 17 MISCONDUCT COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 12-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department has been accused of 17 
counts of administrative misconduct, including perjury, submitting phony 
overtime requests, ignoring court subpoenas and mistreating citizens, 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Sergio Garcia, 33, who was assigned to the Van Nuys Division, was relieved of 
duty without pay Jan. 27 and is scheduled to appear April 19 before a police 
board, which could recommend that he be fired, said Cmdr. William Booth. 
</P>
<P>
"For a police officer, these are very serious," Booth said. "There is quite an 
accumulation of charges . . . and if he is found guilty, severe punishment -- 
along the lines of firing or suspension -- is a real possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who lives in Canyon Country, is on trial in Newhall Municipal Court on 
a charge of falsely reporting a misdemeanor. That charge, which is not included 
in the police case, stems from an altercation between Garcia and Jeanette Cox, 
also of Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
Cox alleges that Garcia threatened to kill her for blocking his way into a 
parking place at a grocery store. Garcia, however, filed a police report 
claiming that Cox dented his car. The case is scheduled to continue Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The police administrative charges against Garcia resulted from an investigation 
initiated after other police officers complained about his conduct, Booth said. 
They include giving false testimony while on duty and under oath in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court, failing to release a prisoner in a timely manner after 
determining that he was not involved in criminal activity and twice failing to 
appear in court when subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension notice also states that Garcia improperly seized property 
belonging to four video stores in Los Angeles and Ontario while working at an 
off-duty job. 
</P>
<P>
Other charges against Garcia, who could not be reached for comment Friday, 
include using a stolen registration tag on his car instead of registering it 
with the Department of Motor Vehicles and failing to notify the DMV when he was 
involved in a traffic accident last month. 
</P>
<P>
At the April 19 board hearing, three police officers above the rank of captain 
are scheduled to hear evidence against Garcia. If the tribunal determines that 
he is guilty, it will recommend punishment to Chief Daryl F. Gates, who can 
either follow the recommendation or lessen the sentence.

TAFT STUDENTS PLAY CATCH UP TO TIE FOR 1ST IN SUPER QUIZ

<P>
Defending state champion Taft High School came from behind to tie for first 
place in the Super Quiz portion of the California Academic Decathlon on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Taft finished even with Palo Alto High School, scoring 38 of 45 correct answers 
on the oral examination, the only portion of the 10-event academic competition 
at Bakersfield College open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the overall competition is the team that scores the most points 
based on all 10 events. That team will be announced at a luncheon today, when 
scores on the nine written portions of the competition will be revealed. The 
winner will compete in the national Academic Decathlon in Providence, R.I., 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great," Shawn Canter, a Taft senior, said after the big event. "Now 
it's time to hit the hotel Jacuzzi." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knows His Presidents 
</P>
<P>
Canter pulled his team into the first-place tie on the second to last Super 
Quiz question. He answered correctly that Richard Nixon was the President who 
prompted Congress to restrict certain executive powers. The Super Quiz topic 
this year was U.S. Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a feeling about it," said Canter, a varsity basketball player. "I must 
have heard it somewhere and just sort of subconsciously remembered it." 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 Taft parents and Los Angeles school officials cheered wildly after 
Canter pulled his team into the tie. Taft won the Los Angeles Unified School 
District's Academic Decathlon in November. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the team did fine," said English teacher Arthur Berchin, Taft's 
Academic Decathlon coach. 
</P>
<P>
Students from 47 California high schools spent Thursday and Friday competing in 
the other nine events by taking written examinations in such subjects as 
science, mathematics, fine arts and literature. Taft students said they stayed 
up most of Thursday night studying. 
</P>
<P>
"We studied all night because we were nervous," said Taft senior Andy 
Rosenthal. 
</P>
<P>
He also brought along a lucky horseshoe that was passed around by team members 
during the Super Quiz. 
</P>
<P>
The nine members of each school's academic decathlon team are divided among 
students with A, B and C grade averages. 
</P>
<P>
This year, all nine members were allowed to participate. Before, there were six 
regular team members and three alternates. 
</P>
<P>
The scores of team members placing last in each grade category will be dropped 
from the school's final tally. 
</P>
<P>
Finishing second in the Super Quiz was the Beverly Hills High School team that 
represented Los Angeles County. The third-place finisher was Fresno's Roosevelt 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
There were no returning members from last year's Taft Academic Decathlon team. 
</P>
<P>
That group won the state championship, but lost narrowly in the national finals 
to J. J. Pearce High School of Richardson, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a team from Marshall High School in Silver Lake won both the state and 
national Academic Decathlon titles.

SETTLEMENT ENDS MALPRACTICE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Westlake Village woman Friday agreed to a $700,000 settlement in a 
malpractice case in which she accused a surgeon of failing to inform her that a 
tumor removed in 1980 was malignant, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
Dolores Webster, a 44-year-old hairdresser, will receive the payment from 
insurers for Dr. Paul A. Ironside, a thoracic and vascular surgeon in Westlake 
Village, in a Van Nuys Superior Court case. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys on both sides agreed that the settlement, which included $250,000 for 
pain and suffering, was the most that could have been awarded by a jury under a 
state law that restricts malpractice awards. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute between doctor and patient centered on whether Ironside continued 
to see Webster after the 1980 operation. 
</P>
<P>
Webster testified that she was not told that the tumor in her chest was 
malignant and that Ironside did not examine or see her again after 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Webster's attorney, Bruce G. Fagel, said that in pretrial depositions, Ironside 
testified that he promptly informed Webster that the tumor was potentially 
malignant and continued to examine her three to four times a year for six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Ironside also testified that he consulted regularly about the case with Dr. 
Earl Detrick, chief radiologist at Westlake Medical Center and Webster's 
brother-in-law, Fagel said. 
</P>
<P>
"But he could produce no medical records or payment records of any examination 
of Mrs. Webster over the six years," Fagel said, "and he explained that by 
saying that he was doing it as a professional courtesy for Dr. Detrick." 
</P>
<P>
Fagel said Detrick, who had originally referred his sister-in-law to Ironside 
in 1980, "flatly contradicted Ironside by testifying that he was not involved 
with or told about any follow-up regarding Mrs. Webster." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claims Follow-Up Done 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement issued through his attorney Friday, Ironside said that 
after informing Webster of the contents of the pathology report in 1980, "it 
was decided to follow the patient and this was done." 
</P>
<P>
Ironside's statement described the settlement as the "compromise of a doubtful 
and disputed claim." 
</P>
<P>
Ironside's attorney, Clayton C. Averbuck, said the surgeon would have no 
comment beyond his statement. Detrick could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Averbuck would not discuss Detrick's or Ironside's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why his client agreed to the maximum settlement when the case was not 
scheduled for trial for at least three years, Averbuck said: "I see no 
significance to settling now as opposed to any other time." 
</P>
<P>
Fagel said pretrial testimony by Detrick and Webster suggested that Ironside 
had "ignored or forgotten about the pathology report, and he agreed to 
settlement for the top amount when it was obvious that Dr. Detrick would not 
support him about the business of following up on the pathology report."

PORTION OF DUMP CLOSED AS FUMES SICKEN 2 WORKERS

<TEXT>
<P>
A small section of Lopez Canyon Landfill in Lake View Terrace has been closed 
since Wednesday when two Los Angeles sanitation workers were hospitalized after 
they were overcome by fumes, city officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Tests were being conducted to determine the source of the fumes, which were 
confined to an 50-by-100-foot area where a bulldozer early Wednesday 
accidentally unearthed a layer of garbage buried in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said there was no danger to residences, which are a quarter of a mile 
away from the closed-off area. 
</P>
<P>
Keith O'Kray, 33, of Newhall was recovering at St. Joseph Medical Center in 
Burbank, where he was treated for dizziness, nausea and diarrhea, said Delwin 
A. Biagi, director of the city Bureau of Sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
O'Kray and Carlann Paul, 29, of Los Angeles were hospitalized Wednesday after 
fainting when they were exposed to the unearthed material at the north end of 
the dump. Paul was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Extremely Unusual' 
</P>
<P>
"This is extremely unusual," said Mike Miller, assistant sanitation director. 
"We've never experienced anything like this." 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation officials declined to speculate on the cause of the fumes but said 
small amounts of toxic substances sometimes are thrown out with household 
trash. The landfill receives only household trash. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi, whose district includes the landfill, said at a 
City Hall news conference Friday that the accident has reinforced his 
opposition to the proposed expansion of the dump. Lopez Canyon, the only 
city-owned landfill, receives about 4,000 of the 6,000 tons a day of household 
refuse collected by the city. 
</P>

Biagi said the old garbage has been reburied. "We believe this incident was 
isolated," he said. "It was very limited to a very small area. The person most 
affected was standing right next to the material," he said of O'Kray. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said he visited the landfill Friday morning after being informed about 
the accident late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"While I have concern about such late notification, I believe the bureau 
behaved responsibly, taking action to see that the workers received proper 
attention, and reporting the incident to the appropriate authorities," he said.

SCHOOLS NEEDED FOR HIGH IQ CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are special schools for children whose IQs are 40 points lower than 
average. We give these children small classes, special buses, special programs 
galore, and what do we do for the children whose IQs deviate in the other 
direction? Some kids who are blessed with IQs that much higher than average 
feel they are punished for it. They are made to "learn" and "relearn" something 
they knew before they sat down in class. When they get really bored, they start 
trouble just to see if they can get out of the dull school, and then their 
motivation for learning is down the tubes completely. They learn outside the 
classroom, but inside they just daydream. This is a waste, and if the kids with 
low IQs have a special school, the kids with very high IQs should have one too. 
</P>
<P>
The individual should work up to his or her potential. This is not happening in 
regular schools. Segregating children with high IQs into gifted classes is not 
as good as a special school. Our gifted students should not have to wait for 
college to start learning!

CSUN STUDENT PRESIDENT'S RESIGNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a former president of the Associated Students at Cal State Northridge, I 
feel a need to comment on the revelation (Feb. 28) that this year's president 
failed to be enrolled as a student. 
</P>
<P>
Every president knows the bylaws backward and forward and is aware of the 
requirement to be taking seven units. Had Lynn Westlund been a student activist 
or a minority, the CSUN administration probably would have attempted to remove 
her from office, as it attempted to remove four senators from office in 1983 
just for failing to sign our financial statements. 
</P>
<P>
If Westlund's actions are not criminal fraud or misrepresentation for taking a 
stipend and allocating funds, then they should be.

VAN NUYS MAN ROBBED THEM, 2 WOMEN TESTIFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 38-year-old Van Nuys man was identified by two women Friday as the man who 
beat them and stole their jewelry after following them home from a Studio City 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Claude Davis, on parole for a burglary conviction at the time of the robberies, 
was arrested Jan. 10 and charged with 10 counts of robbery and one count of 
attempted robbery, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they do not believe he is connected to a ring of bandits suspected 
of committing as many as 50 "follow-home" robberies in affluent neighborhoods 
of the San Fernando Valley, West Los Angeles and Glendale in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven men were arrested March 3 in those robberies, police said. Two of them 
have since been released. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Joann Puls, 62, testified at a preliminary hearing in San Fernando 
Municipal Court that Davis followed her home from a shopping center at Ventura 
and Laurel Canyon boulevards Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Puls said she saw Davis standing by the garage of her Studio City home after 
she drove inside. 
</P>
<P>
When she stepped toward Davis to look at a piece of paper he was holding, "he 
lunged, socked me and, the next thing I knew, I was flat on my back," Puls 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
Puls said Davis got on top of her, grabbed her throat and pulled three diamond 
rings off her fingers. " 'Do you want to die for these. . . ?' " Puls quoted 
Davis as saying before he fled with her rings, estimated to be worth about 
$36,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bette Rainer of Studio City testified Friday that Davis fractured her jaw 
during a Nov. 30 robbery at her home in which a $30,000 ring was taken. She had 
been followed home from the same shopping area. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' 11 victims were women ranging in age from 55 to 91, said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Lisa Kahn. All were beaten, with some suffering broken fingers and noses, 
she said. In one case, the victim was beaten but nothing was taken, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Davis could be sentenced to 30 years in prison, Kahn said. Davis' 
preliminary hearing is scheduled to continue Monday.

L.A. FIRM TO JOIN IN BUILDING JAPAN HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY YOSHIHARA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tishman Realty &amp; Construction said Friday that it will become the first 
U.S. company to participate in a private construction project in Japan, through 
a joint venture with Aoki Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles firm said its wholly owned subsidiary, Tishman Construction 
Corp. of Japan, will team up with Tokyo-based Aoki to build a 400-room, 
$200-million luxury high-rise hotel in Osaka. The hotel will be operated by 
Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts, a Seattle subsidiary of Aoki. 
</P>
<P>
"This could well signal the opening of the marketplace for Americans," said 
Abraham S. Bolsky, president and chief executive of Tishman of California. He 
said the first phase of the hotel project is valued at about $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached last May between the United States and Japan, U.S. 
firms are allowed to bid for Japanese construction projects in the private 
sector. American firms have not been successful in bidding for public projects 
in Japan, such as the new airport in Kansai and the Tokyo Bay Bridge. Tishman's 
Japanese unit received a license from the Japanese government last October to 
do both public and private construction. 
</P>
<P>
The new 430,000-square-foot hotel will be built on land owned by Aoki, an 
international construction firm. The parcel, adjacent to Osaka Station, the 
city's main railway terminal, is part of an urban renewal plan, consisting of a 
hotel, office and retail space. 
</P>
<P>
Tishman and Aoki together will oversee the construction, including design 
analysis, planning, scheduling and budgeting. Aoki, however, will serve as 
general contractor. A Tishman construction management crew will be assigned to 
Osaka during the scheduled three-year construction project, which will begin in 
April, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In building the hotel and office complex, Tishman will bring to Japan for the 
first time American construction management techniques. The U.S. technique is 
"fast tracked," which means that construction begins before the structure's 
design is completed, which usually results in time and cost savings. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese firms have not traditionally used the fast-track method of 
construction," explained Bolsky. "It would be our task to organize that, once 
we're past the preconstruction phase." He said that much of the planning can be 
done from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Tishman will station construction management personnel in Osaka during the 
entire period of design and construction. 
</P>
<P>
Tishman and Aoki have worked together on projects since 1984, including a Los 
Angeles office building known as the Olympic Centre.

A FEW STALWARTS STAY ON THE JOB

<P>
To maintain the pressure in their war of nerves with Eastern Airlines, striking 
workers have been snapping photographs of Eastern shuttle flight crew members 
as they arrive at Boston's Logan Airport. 
</P>
<P>
But if the strikers' goal is intimidation, it has not worked on Capt. Walt 
Shivers. The exuberant veteran pilot taxied his plane in front of the strikers' 
telephoto lenses this week with a sign perched jauntily in his cockpit window: 
"Flying &amp; Love It." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not making friends of those people by being here," said Shivers, one of 
200 pilots still working since Eastern filed for bankruptcy court protection 
Thursday. "But this is the hard core." 
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 of Eastern's hardest-core employees have worked to keep the 
beleaguered airline's planes flying this week, enduring resentment, harsh words 
and even threats from the union mechanics and pilots with whom they have long 
worked side by side. The mechanics went out on strike a week ago, and most of 
the pilots have refused to cross the picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs at Eastern have not been easy since the airline flew into heavy weather a 
decade ago. The airline's mounting financial problems have forced pilots and 
flight attendants to give back a portion of their salaries and to work in an 
atmosphere often poisoned by acrimony between labor and management. 
</P>
<P>
But if some people think that deregulation and Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas 
Air, Eastern's parent company, have taken the fun out of the airline business, 
the Eastern loyalists who have kept working still think they have pretty good 
jobs. Many accept the company's assertion that radical cost cuts are necessary 
for the airline to survive and say the strike was the last thing Eastern 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
"When the union told them to go on strike, it was like Jim Jones trying to get 
his people to drink the poison Kool-Aid," said Shivers, who was interviewed 
during a layover at New York's La Guardia Airport. "We're not drinking it." His 
reference was to the mass suicide-execution of more than 900 religious cultists 
in Guyana in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the La Guardia terminal of Eastern's New York-Washington-Boston air 
shuttle, a picket line of striking mechanics and pilots stood in front of huge 
placards reading, "Save Eastern" and "Stop Lorenzo." A striker with a bullhorn 
was trying to persuade travelers on the flights -- with fares now cut to $12 -- 
that the planes were unsafe and the flight crews inexperienced. 
</P>
<P>
During 1986 labor trouble at Eastern, Shivers had an argument over the phone 
with another pilot, who he said threatened to "come down and get me." Since 
then, Shivers has kept a sawed-off shotgun at hand at his Miami home, 
illuminated his house with special lights at night and bought a guard dog. 
</P>
<P>
Shivers said he had a vigorous exchange of opinions with some strikers at the 
Atlanta airport the other day. He had ventured into the terminal's waiting area 
to buy a pack of cigarettes, trying to hide his identity from the strikers by 
putting a wind breaker over his pilot's uniform. 
</P>
<P>
But they may have noticed his regulation black trousers and shoes, for he was 
soon surrounded by three angry flight attendants and a half-dozen pilots. 
Still, "it was all very civil," Shivers said. 
</P>
<P>
He regrets that the strike has probably hurt his relations permanently with 
other union pilots. "I know I'll probably never be able to sit in the jump seat 
of another union carrier," he said, referring to the cockpit seats where 
off-duty pilots are sometimes allowed to travel as a courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
Another working pilot, Capt. Steve Glasgow, had to ask Eastern to provide a 
security guard for his home in Charlotte, N.C., because of the reaction some 
colleagues have had to his outspoken anti-strike opinions. For about a year, 
Glasgow has mailed out a newsletter called "Pilots With Another View" to get 
across his opinion that the Air Line Pilots Assn. has been pursuing the wrong 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Glasgow said he and his wife have received a number of vaguely threatening 
anonymous calls, including one in which the caller told his wife, "We know your 
husband's away and that you're alone." 
</P>
<P>
Glasgow, a 22-year Eastern veteran, said of his fellow non-strikers, "I'm proud 
of the people who are here today." 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern loyalists recount how the periodic flare of labor troubles has been 
making their jobs harder for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
Flight attendant Ann Roever joined the airline in 1961 after graduating from 
college, turning down a number of teaching jobs. She had been on the job only 
six months when a strike caused the airline to abruptly uproot her from Chicago 
to New York. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, said Roever, who continues to work during the strike, "it seems 
like there have been so many labor problems." Among them have been slowdowns in 
which pilots intentionally fell behind schedule and job actions where ground 
crews would leave full planes stranded on runways, or leave unloaded baggage on 
the tarmac. 
</P>
<P>
But recently, the problems have gotten worse. "Eventually, you're just crisised 
out," Roever said.

AIRLINE MOVES TO RESTORE SOME FLIGHTS

Eastern Airlines, operating under the cover of bankruptcy law, moved Friday to 
restore some of its flights even as it continues to face the pickets of 
striking machinists and the anger of ticket holders seeking refunds for 
canceled flights. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the airline said its shuttle flights in the New 
York-Washington-Boston corridor were packed with passengers lured by bargain 
$12 one-way fares. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, Eastern said, 40 round-trip flights on other routes will be 
restored. The carrier said it will resume flying to 13 of the 18 cities it 
serves in Central and South America. 
</P>
<P>
Before the weeklong walkout by its machinists and pilots and the carrier's 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing Thursday, Eastern operated 1,040 flights a day. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the beginning of a new, smaller, restructured and viable Eastern 
Airlines," Eastern Chief Executive Phil Bakes said in a prepared statement. "We 
will continue to expand operations in prudent, substantial increments." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern said it will begin its new schedule on Sunday with service to Latin 
America from Miami. On Monday, Eastern will operate three daily round trips 
between Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico; one round trip each between Miami and 
LaGuardia Airport in New York and between LaGuardia and Montreal; and 14 daily 
round trips between between Boston and Washington. Eastern is also operating a 
full schedule of 62 shuttle flights each weekday. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern officials said there will be enough personnel to fly the planes needed 
for the announced schedule because some pilots who had honored the pickets of 
striking machinists are now seeking to return to work. The union representing 
pilots strongly denied that claim. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Cori Zywotow said that as of Thursday, when the bankruptcy filing 
had been made, Eastern had 200 pilots who flew the shuttle and one 
three-day-a-week flight to South America. 
</P>
<P>
"Since then, the pilots have been calling in and asking how to report back to 
work," she said. "We have more than enough pilots to fly the new schedule." 
However, managers were still filling in for striking mechanics, baggage 
handlers and other ground personnel, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts noted that pilots came back to work at Continental Airlines, 
Eastern's sister carrier under the ownership of Texas Air Corp., when 
Continental was placed in Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1983 -- apparently out of 
fear of losing their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Neidl, analyst with the New York brokerage McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei, 
said the availability of pilots "is much tighter" now. Nevertheless, he added, 
pilots who move to another airline must start at the lowest seniority level and 
accept much lower pay. 
</P>
<P>
But the Eastern Air Line Pilots Assn. disputed the notion that enough of its 
members are crossing picket lines so that the airline can increase its 
schedules. Rather, the union said, the number of pilots reporting for work was 
"decreasing." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Air Line Pilots Assn. said Eastern had fewer than 100 
pilots available for flight operations, a number that has remained virtually 
unchanged since the beginning of the machinists' strike, and that some of those 
pilots are management personnel. 
</P>
<P>
ALPA also charged that the company has "stepped up its campaign to threaten, 
coerce and otherwise entice pilots to cross (machinist picket lines). This 
includes illegal offers of bonuses for second officers, which are in 
particularly short supply, and phone calls to pilots' homes, attempting to 
intimidate pilots, their spouses and even their children, with threats that 
their breadwinner will never be able to work again for Eastern." 
</P>
<P>
A ruling late Thursday by a federal bankruptcy judge effectively cleared the 
way for Eastern to continue its operations. The judge gave the airline 
permission to pay its working employees but made no provision for paying 
workers who are honoring machinists' picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the machinists said they will mount a legal battle to get wages 
owed to striking union members. While the airline reorganizes under bankruptcy 
court protection, a federal judge must approve all of the company's 
expenditures and transactions. 
</P>
<P>
The new crowds on Eastern's shuttle came after the carrier held out the lure of 
special fares for business travelers during the week and $12 on weekends. 
Previously, shuttle traffic had been almost non-existent with some flights 
carrying as few as six passengers. The shuttle normally flies between 4,000 and 
6,500 passengers daily. 
</P>
<P>
By Friday morning, an Eastern spokeswoman said, planes were half-filled and by 
the afternoon they were going out full. 
</P>
<P>
On other routes where Eastern had maintained a strong presence, competitors 
were picking up some business. But other airlines were making no extraordinary 
efforts to profit from Eastern's difficulties by adding extra flights or routes 
-- primarily because they already had plenty of seats available on existing 
flights to accommodate extra passengers and because they don't have aircraft or 
crews to spare. 
</P>
<P>
The carrier adding the most flights was Continental -- on routes to Florida 
from Newark, LaGuardia and Washington's National Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Delta Air Lines spokesman James Lundy said his carrier has available for sale 
63,000 seats out of Atlanta each day and those flights average about 60% full. 
On its entire system, Delta's flights are 50% full. "As you can see, we have 
plenty of space available," he said. He said Delta is adding two flights this 
weekend to San Juan to accommodate cruise ship passengers. 
</P>
<P>
American Airlines was also adding several flights this weekend to San Juan for 
the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
In other Eastern matters, a federal judge in New York extended indefinitely his 
temporary ban to prevent railroad workers from striking in sympathy with 
airline workers. The ban imposed by U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. 
will stay in place until he renders a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday that 
the White House staff was continuing to monitor the situation but that 
President Bush "is not rethinking" his decision to stay out of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
"I've not heard any discussions" of changing policy and invoking the federal 
law that would allow a 60-day cooling off period in the strike, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed that they haven't been able to work out an agreement with 
the unions," he said, "but otherwise, I don't think we have any comment at this 
point."

DELIBERATIONS TO BEGIN IN GAF STOCK DEAL CASE

Jury deliberations are due to begin today in the GAF Corp. stock market 
manipulation trial, which has been under way in federal court in Manhattan for 
more than five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe spent much of Friday instructing jurors 
on the legal issues in the case. They were then to be sent to a hotel for the 
night. The judge has ordered the jury sequestered, meaning that jurors won't be 
allowed to go home at night, to avoid any exposure to press coverage of the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
GAF Corp. and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, are accused of arranging 
with the Los Angeles-based brokerage firm Jefferies &amp; Co. to illegally bid 
up the closing price of Union Carbide's stock in late 1986, at a time when GAF 
was preparing to sell a big block of Carbide shares. 
</P>
<P>
Eight criminal counts are pending against GAF and Sherwin, including 
conspiracy, stock market manipulation and securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on how long it takes the jury of nine women and three men to review 
the evidence, a verdict could come as early as this weekend.

L.A. WIRE MAKER SEEKING PROTECTION FROM CREDITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Davis Walker Corp., the nation's largest independent maker of wire and wire 
products, said Friday that it filed for protection from its creditors while it 
reorganizes under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. 
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old Los Angeles steel processor said it was a victim of import 
restrictions that forced it to buy costly domestic steel from mills in the East 
and South. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which makes barbed wire, chain link fencing, stucco netting and 
other wire products, had sales of about $175 million last year. It employs 850, 
including about 400 at plants in Los Angeles and Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
In its bankruptcy petition, Davis Walker listed assets of $97.86 million and 
liabilities of $94.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it sought bankruptcy protection after it was unable to pay $42 
million to its lenders. That debt includes $14.5 million owed to Bank of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Davis Walker said its financial problems started four years ago when the Reagan 
Administration imposed "voluntary restraints" on the amount of steel imported 
by American firms to protect domestic steel producers. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Valenti, a Davis Walker vice president, said the restraints forced the 
company to buy 60% of its steel from domestic producers. Before the restraints 
went into effect, he said, Davis Walker relied mostly on cheaper imported steel 
to make its steel wire. 
</P>
<P>
Valenti said the company was unable to compete with imports by Canadian steel 
processors, which were unaffected by the voluntary restraints. 
</P>
<P>
The company's financial problems forced it to close its plants in Dallas, 
Houston, New Orleans and Memphis two years ago. The company continues to 
operate plants in Hayward in Northern California and in Kent, Wash. It also has 
plants in Vancouver and Edmonton, Canada. Valenti said the Canadian operations 
weren't part of the bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
In its bankruptcy petition, Davis Walker said it owed $23.4 million to Mitsui 
&amp; Co. USA Inc., making the Japanese firm its largest creditor. Valenti said 
Davis Walker bought about 15% of its steel from Mitsui.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: NOVICE INVESTORS CAN GET FREE HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
QUESTION: I recently bought shares in two different companies. When I receive 
my statements, I'm not fully confident that I understand them. Also, I would 
like to become more active in the stock market, but I feel hampered by my lack 
of understanding of the market's workings. Are there any publications aimed at 
the average reader who wants to understand the stock market? -- A. R. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: There are many such publications. For starters, you can ask one or more 
of the national stock brokerage firms for their brochures written for new 
investors. All you have to do is call a local branch office and request the 
pamphlet; typically, there is no charge. However, be prepared for a follow-up 
call from a broker looking for your business; nothing in life is completely 
free. 
</P>
<P>
The stock exchanges themselves are another good source of information. For 
example, the New York Stock Exchange publishes an Investors Information Kit, a 
fairly extensive guide for the beginning investor. The price is $10, including 
postage and handling. You may obtain one by writing to the exchange at 1 
Underhill Blvd., Syosset, N.Y. 11791. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, your local public library should have a shelf full of books on 
business and investing. Our experts say the following titles are among the best 
for the novice investor: "Understanding Wall Street," by Jeffrey B. Little and 
Lucien Rhodes; "How to Read and Understand the Financial News," by Gerald 
Warfield, and "A Random Walk Down Wall Street," by Burton Malkiel. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I use my vehicle during the normal course of my job, and I am reimbursed by 
my employer at the rate of 20.5 cents per mile. May I depreciate my vehicle, 
and if so, how should I do it? -- P. S. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, you may depreciate the value of your car. But, be advised: it's not 
going to be easy. The formulas are detailed and complicated, and, in the event 
of a tax audit, you should be prepared to produce precise records chronicling 
where and when you drove your car on business and how much money you spent 
maintaining it. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are several automobile expense deduction systems available to 
the taxpayer, by far the easiest is the standard mileage rate deduction: 24 
cents per business mile for the first 15,000 business miles you drive; 11 cents 
thereafter. But if you want to depreciate your vehicle, you must use what the 
IRS calls the "actual expense" method. 
</P>
<P>
To employ the actual expense system, you will first need to determine the fair 
market value of your vehicle at the time you started using it for business. If 
you are just beginning to depreciate your car, the IRS says you must use a 
five-year schedule. For the first year, the IRS allows you to depreciate the 
vehicle by 20% of its fair market value, if you used it for business for more 
than 50% of miles driven. If you used it for business 50% or less, then the 
depreciation rate is 10%. In either case, the maximum amount for the first year 
is $2,560. (This limit was installed to curb the number of taxpayers claiming 
their luxury cars as business vehicles.) 
</P>
<P>
Now, you must determine what percentage of the time you have driven your car 
for business, compared to personal use of the vehicle. Multiply your allowed 
depreciation by that percentage to arrive at your allowed business 
depreciation. Let's say you're entitled to depreciate your car by $2,000 in 
1988 and the car was used for business 50% of the time. You're entitled to 
$1,000 depreciation. But don't stop here. 
</P>
<P>
Now, you have to total your annual costs of maintaining your vehicle. Include 
all expenses: gas, oil, maintenance, insurance, repairs and other operating 
expenses. (This is why you must keep careful records.) Multiply the total by 
50%, since you use your car only half the time on business. Let's say you had 
$5,000 in expenses; the share allocated to your business use would be $2,500. 
Including depreciation, the total is now is $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
However, you must now subtract the amount of mileage reimbursement you received 
from your employer. Any excess expense is considered a miscellaneous deduction 
and is added to the rest of your miscellaneous deductions. (Any excess 
reimbursement is considered ordinary income and you must report it.) 
</P>
<P>
But, beware: Miscellaneous expenses are deductible on your income taxes only to 
the extent that they exceed 2% of your adjusted gross income. So, after doing 
all these mathematical computations, you may very well discover that you really 
don't have anything -- including depreciation -- to deduct at all. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, if your employer lists your mileage reimbursement on your W-2 
statement of salary and wages, you are allowed to deduct -- dollar for dollar 
-- up to that amount. But any expenses incurred above the reimbursement level 
is subject to the 2% limit. 
</P>
<P>
Use IRS Form 2106 to compute your deduction, and read the instructions 
carefully. You may also want to read a fuller explanation of the depreciation 
and business auto expense deductions in one of the many income tax manuals 
available at book stores and your public library.

STATE S&amp;L REGULATORS HOBBLED BY LACK OF FUNDS, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Department of Savings and Loan is almost as bad off as the 
industry it regulates, according to a report released Friday by a legislative 
study commission. 
</P>
<P>
The state agency is inadequately staffed, may run out of funds by the end of 
the fiscal year and is hobbled because its budget comes from the institutions 
it is supposed to regulate, said the study and its authors. 
</P>
<P>
"The report . . . concludes after two years of study that inadequate support of 
our state's regulatory system contributed significantly to the financial 
disaster we are now faced with," Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti (D-Los 
Angeles) said at a press conference in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The study was done by the Senate Advisory Commission on Cost Control in State 
Government. It evaluated the effectiveness of both the state banking department 
and the savings and loan department, but most of the criticism was directed at 
the savings and loan agency. 
</P>
<P>
The department regulates the 135 thrifts that operate under California charter. 
The remaining 70 or so thrifts in the state are federally regulated. All 
insured institutions, whether supervised by the state or federal regulators, 
are insured by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
The state S&amp;L department's $9-million budget comes solely from assessments 
on the institutions it regulates. Many of the biggest state thrifts converted 
to federal status in the early 1980s, leaving the state agency to cope with a 
declining budget as regulatory problems became more complex as a result of the 
new powers granted to thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the department was forced to relax its supervision of 
thrifts under threat that they would convert to federal status and further 
reduce the agency's budget. 
</P>
<P>
William J. Crawford, commissioner of the department, acknowledged the need for 
a new funding mechanism, but he disputed the assertion that the agency has gone 
easy on any institution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Combine Regulators 
</P>
<P>
Crawford said he cut his own budget last year when he refused to approve a 
state charter for the new American Savings &amp; Loan after its purchase by 
Texas investor Robert M. Bass and others. Crawford objected to some of the 
activities that were being allowed of the new owners, and American eventually 
obtained a federal charter. 
</P>
<P>
The study said new funds must be found to keep the agency afloat and increase 
spending for training its examiners. But Roberti acknowledged that persuading 
the Legislature to appropriate money for the agency might be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to factor this into our priorities," Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Hallahan, a spokesman for the California League of Savings Institutions, 
said its members might be willing to increase the assessment they pay the 
agency. He also said there has been talk in the Legislature about combining the 
S&amp;L regulators with the banking regulators, which would save some money.

CARNATION TO ALTER LABEL ON BABY FORMULA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carnation Co., under fire for using an infant formula label that has been 
called misleading, on Friday said it will remove the term "hypo-allergenic" 
from its Good Start H.A. product. 
</P>
<P>
Carnation said the label change, which will be effective in April, is being 
made to eliminate potential consumer confusion about the word 
"hypo-allergenic," which means reduced potential for allergic reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"Carnation Good Start H.A. is hypo-allergenic but not non-allergenic," said 
Carnation President Timm Crull. "The distinction is significant to a very 
small, but potentially vulnerable, group of infants who are severely allergic 
and who should change formulas only under the direct supervision of a 
physician." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adverse Reactions Reported 
</P>
<P>
The term hypo-allergenic, used on a number of product labels, has become the 
subject of controversy. The Food and Drug Administration has asked companies -- 
Carnation, among them -- to prove that their products are more easily tolerated 
by some allergic consumers. The FDA also has asked industry to help develop an 
easily understood definition for "hypo-allergenic." 
</P>
<P>
The FDA is also investigating six reported incidents of adverse reactions to 
Good Start. Carnation, a subsidiary of Swiss-based Nestle SA, introduced Good 
Start last November. 
</P>
<P>
The move did not satisfy critics -- among them, Action for Corporate 
Accountability, a Minneapolis-based consumer group. Carnation should also 
remove the initials "H.A." from the product, according to Janice Mantell, 
executive director of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"More than this cosmetic change is necessary," she said. "Nestle's determined 
effort to enter the lucrative infant formula market through its acquisition of 
Carnation must not be made at the expense of the health of U.S. infants."

U.S., EEC OFFICIALS MEET OVER FARM SUBSIDY DISAGREEMENTS 
</P>

<P>
Top American trade negotiators met Friday with officials of the European 
Economic Community for a series of talks expected to focus on the contentious 
issue of farm subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and Trade Representative Carla Hills were 
greeted by Frans Andriessen, the top foreign affairs official of the 12-nation 
trading bloc, at the start of two days of talks. 
</P>
<P>
Ray MacSharry, the community's agriculture chief, was also scheduled to take 
part in discussions at the Common Market's headquarters in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
The four officials held a round of get-acquainted talks in February in 
Washington during which they agreed to set up a task force to try to resolve a 
dispute over a European ban on imports of hormone-treated meat from the United 
States. The task force has until early May to complete its findings. 
</P>
<P>
At this session, the officials were expected to discuss ways to try to ease a 
conflict between the United States and the Common Market over government 
subsidies to farmers. The dispute has stalled international trade negotiations, 
known as the Uruguay Round. 
</P>
<P>
Andriessen said last month that the United States offered a new proposal on the 
issue, but he gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Find Common Ground 
</P>
<P>
The two sides are attempting to find common ground before further Uruguay Round 
discussions take place April 5 in Geneva. The talks are being held under the 
auspices of the 96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
The United States wants the Common Market to end import barriers and export and 
domestic farm subsidies that it says distort trade. It initially demanded that 
the subsidies be eliminated by the year 2000 but has since said the date is 
negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
The community has refused to agree on a date for withdrawing all supports and 
instead has insisted that the two sides discuss only short- and medium-term 
reform measures. 
</P>
<P>
The Common Market provides hefty subsidies to its 18 million farmers through 
guaranteed prices for many of their crops. It also gives exporters help so that 
costlier European farm products can compete with lower world prices. 
</P>
<P>
The United States complains that the export subsidies have helped the Europeans 
increase their share of the world market. It has responded by setting up its 
own Export Enhancement Program. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, European leaders began the politically sensitive task of curbing 
farm payments. They agreed to limit the maximum annual amount of expenditure on 
price guarantees over five years. U.S. officials say the measures were not 
enough to fix a fundamentally flawed policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smaller Farms 
</P>
<P>
Europeans argue that they cannot leave the bulk of their farmers to compete 
without help in the world market. Their farms, they say, are on average smaller 
than in the United States and need extra aid. 
</P>
<P>
On the hormone issue, U.S. and EEC officials set a 75-day cooling-off period, 
beginning in mid-February, so that the task force could find ways for American 
producers to export hormone-free beef to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Common Market on Jan. 1 imposed a ban on imports of meat from cattle 
treated with growth hormones. The United States refused to comply and instead 
slapped stiff duties on a variety of European products. 
</P>
<P>
The Europeans have threatened to impose their own retaliatory measures -- tough 
tariffs on American walnuts and dried fruit -- if the conflict isn't resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The hormone ban was imposed because of European concerns that the stimulants 
pose a health risk to consumers, a claim that the United States disputes. 
</P>
<P>
The ban is expected to block imports of about $100 million worth of beef and 
beef byproducts from the United States. The trading partners totaled about $165 
billion worth of trade in 1988.

IRS HELP LINE HAS ERROR RATE OF 30.8%

<P>
The Internal Revenue Service said Friday that its telephone "assistors" are 
giving even more wrong answers than last year, and it promised to waive 
penalties for taxpayers who can document erroneous information. 
</P>
<P>
Calls to the IRS toll-free numbers this year are producing answers that would 
lead to errors on taxpayer returns 30.8% of the time, the agency said. At this 
time last year, the error rate was about 28%. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not pleased . . . with our performance with respect to accuracy," said 
Robert LeBaube, IRS director of taxpayer services. 
</P>
<P>
LeBaube said the agency will not penalize a taxpayer for an error caused by 
faulty advice from an IRS employee if the taxpayer can provide the name of the 
employee, the question asked and the date of the wrong answer. The IRS took a 
similar stance last year. 
</P>
<P>
LeBaube said the massive changes in the 1986 tax overhaul -- which was hailed 
by many as a simplification -- and the sheer number of tax bills enacted must 
carry a lot of the blame for confusion among IRS employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Since 1976, there have been 138 public laws modifying the Internal Revenue 
Code," LeBaube said. "Since the Tax Reform Act of 1986, there have been 13 
public laws changing the code and in 1988 alone there were seven public laws 
affecting the code." 
</P>
<P>
The General Accounting Office tested IRS employees during the 1988 
return-filing season and found that the agency provided wrong answers to 36% of 
test questions. One of the main problems was the failure of IRS employees known 
as assistors to probe callers for additional information, the GAO found. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part-Time Workers 
</P>
<P>
The IRS has 5,000 assistors, many of them part-time employees, answering 
taxpayers' telephone calls this filing season. About 1,500 of that number are 
new to the job. The workers, who earn from $6.50 to $11.70 an hour, must have 
at least a high school education and undergo a minimum of five weeks of 
training. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not accountants or tax lawyers," LeBaube noted. "I don't think the 
economy could support giving us 5,000 tax accountants" to answer calls. 
</P>
<P>
Through last weekend, the telephone system had received 15.5 million calls 
since Jan. 1, compared with 16.9 million for the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although fewer people are calling with questions this year, the IRS Tele-Tax 
system, which provides taped answers on more than 150 specific subjects, has 
received 7.8 million calls -- more than triple the figure at this time last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to improve the toll-free system, an IRS team is making about 
20,000 calls with test questions.

Judy Rooney-Carter, an 11-year teaching veteran, was punched, kicked and almost 
stabbed by a pupil wielding a pitchfork outside her high school classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Frankie Bryant was nearly raped at knifepoint and gunpoint, threatened by a man 
brandishing a gun on school grounds and beaten by a student on drugs -- all on 
elementary school campuses in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
These were not isolated incidents. In big cities across the country, violence 
-- all too frequently involving guns, knives and other weapons -- is spreading 
from the streets into schoolyards and classrooms. It is a fact of life in the 
inner-city, where the prevalence of gangs and drug dealing brings weapons to 
the schoolhouse door. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shattering the Quiet 
</P>
<P>
But it also is shattering the quiet of some suburban areas, as evidenced this 
week when a teacher in the San Fernando Valley was stabbed by a student she had 
reprimanded, and last month in La Crescenta where a teacher disarmed a 
13-year-old boy who waved a loaded .357 magnum in a classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Lax discipline, overcrowded campuses, inadequate school police protection and 
district policies that allow disruptive or violent students to be transferred 
to schools outside their neighborhood are among the reasons for rampant school 
crime cited by teachers, principals and other experts. 
</P>
<P>
More weapons are appearing on or near Los Angeles district campuses and are 
being used more often in school assaults. There are no figures to show whether 
the trend is nationwide, but authorities agree that violent incidents generally 
are becoming more serious. 
</P>
<P>
"Fistfights," said Ronald Stephens of the National School Safety Center in 
Encino, "are being replaced by gunfights." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On Their Guard 
</P>
<P>
The attacks have set students as well as teachers on their guard. "Ninety-nine 
point nine percent of our kids are good kids," said Jim Lucas, a teacher at 
Belmont High School in Los Angeles. "(But) I think most experienced teachers 
would never let a student get behind them, especially in a tense situation." 
</P>
<P>
Dionne Shoemake, a junior at Fairfax High School, where a former student was 
fatally shot two years ago by two students who were thought to be gang members, 
said: "I don't really feel safe -- not at this campus." 
</P>
<P>
And, said 12-year-old Lisa Guzman, who next year will attend Olive Vista Junior 
High in Sylmar where the recent stabbing occurred: "I want to go there, but now 
I'm kind of afraid." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is forcing school officials in Los Angeles and in other urban 
centers across the nation to grapple with hard questions of how to make 
campuses safe without trampling on students' rights or turning schools into 
fortresses. 
</P>
<P>
Some school districts are turning to extreme solutions. In Detroit, metal 
detectors have been used to screen students at 23 high schools since 1984, 
despite initial long lines and delays of up to three hours in starting the 
school day. 
</P>
<P>
The New York City school system last fall introduced detectors at five high 
schools and plans to expand their use at 10 additional campuses this year. 
Baltimore schools recently began enforcing a dress code that prohibits 
students, when they are walking through hallways, from carrying bags or wearing 
jumpsuits, sweat suits or overcoats that could conceal weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles Unified School District, the school board so far has 
resisted such Draconian measures. But reports of firearms seen in and around 
its 600 schools have tripled in three years, according to statistics collected 
by the district and reported to the state. 
</P>
<P>
Even with 302 sworn officers -- which makes the district's police department 
the fourth-largest in Los Angeles County -- officials say that they cannot add 
enough police officers to keep up with the fast-growing student enrollment and, 
largely because of rigorous training and screening and low salaries, vacancies 
are hard to fill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 Million Campus Assaults 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, 3 million assaults occurred on public school campuses in 1986, 
according to Stephens, who is the director of the National School Safety 
Center, a joint program of the U.S. Department of Justice and Pepperdine 
University. 
</P>
<P>
According to a 1978 study by the National Institute of Education, nearly 
282,000 students and 5,200 teachers were assaulted in school each month, but 
teachers were five times as likely as students to suffer serious injuries in 
the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"We average one teacher a day being attacked badly enough to require medical 
attention and time out of school" in the Los Angeles district, according to 
United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson. He said he based his 
observation on telephone calls from teachers to the union. "There is growing 
concern among teachers about violence." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987-88, the district reported 300 assaults on employees and 561 attacks on 
students. More attacks occurred at junior high than at senior high campuses -- 
"raging hormones," one district official said -- but the high school assaults 
tended to be more severe. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular weapons were knives. In 1987-88, the last full year for which 
statistics are available, Los Angeles district schools reported 478 incidents 
involving knives, almost double the number reported in 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
But incidents involving firearms have tripled over the last three years, from 
75 in 1985-86 to 255 in 1987-88, the figures show. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question in my mind that the threat of firearms in and about 
campuses is greater now than it ever has been," said Wesley C. Mitchell, the 
district's chief of police. 
</P>
<P>
And no school is immune. "We have nice, suburban schools where we pick up 
youngsters with guns," Mitchell said. "And we pick up guns at elementary 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
Judy Rooney-Carter was attacked a year ago while teaching at View Park High 
School, a continuation school in the mid-city area. 
</P>
<P>
"A student who was believed to be under the influence of PCP came at me with a 
pitchfork," she said in an interview this week. The student, whom she recalls 
as being over 6 feet and weighing more than 200 pounds, lunged at her with the 
pitchfork. She avoided getting stabbed, but she was punched, kicked and flung 
about by the hair. She sees a chiropractor for her physical injuries. She has 
been treated by psychiatrists and psychologists for the emotional wounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody starts to doubt you, and you start to doubt yourself," she said. 
"It's been a horrible nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Zwick described the last attack she experienced, which took place in 
November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at Venice High School," the teacher recalled. "This student was giving 
me a hard time, and I said, 'Let's go to the office.' I was standing in the 
doorway. He took some papers I was working on off my desk and threw them. I 
asked him to pick them up." 
</P>
<P>
But instead, the student, a 15-year-old boy, uttered an obscenity, grabbed 
Zwick by the shoulders and threw her into the door. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran into the hall to try and get help from the teachers. Everybody closed 
their doors. I asked the librarian across the hall if I could use the phone to 
call the office. There were phones in the rooms but they didn't work. . . . I 
had no support," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Zwick has not returned to teaching since the incident and has filed a worker's 
compensation suit against the school district. 
</P>
<P>
Expressing shock over the recent stabbing of a teacher at Olive Vista Junior 
High, she said: "Maybe they need to put metal detectors on campus, like they do 
at airports." 
</P>
<P>
In Detroit, the first district in the country to employ walk-through and 
hand-held metal detectors on a wide scale, the devices are used to check 
students about once a month at each of the 23 high schools, district 
spokeswoman Marie Furcron said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Metal Sweeps Continue 
</P>
<P>
The metal sweeps have continued despite a court challenge by the Michigan 
American Civil Liberties Union that they violate students' constitutional 
protection against unreasonable search and seizure. 
</P>
<P>
Although Furcron said she could not provide specific figures, she said the 
district views the detector program as a success because officials are 
discovering fewer and fewer weapons. 
</P>
<P>
She also said the majority of students and parents have accepted the use of 
detectors because "the alternative -- having guns at school -- is so 
abhorrent." 
</P>
<P>
In the New York City school system, where about 160 guns and 1,500 knives were 
confiscated last year, hand-held metal detectors are used to check students at 
five high schools one day a week, according to school security chief Bruce 
Irushalmi. Security officers screen every second or third student. 
</P>
<P>
"We're finding more weapons than before. . . . They're not getting past the 
door," Irushalmi said. 
</P>
<P>
But, with only three months of using the detectors, it is too early to tell 
whether the screening program is making a dent in weapons on campus, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Principals, parents and students, however, feel the devices are "unequivocally 
successful," Irushalmi said, adding that some principals have reported that 
fewer fights are occurring on their campuses since the detectors were 
introduced in November. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the New York schools security chief does not view metal detectors 
as a long-term solution. 
</P>
<P>
"I view education as the solution and the desire of the community (to tackle 
the weapons problem) as a solution," said Irushalmi. "I think it's regrettable 
to have to use (detectors) in schools." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles school board member Alan Gershman, who proposed a study of metal 
detectors a few years ago, said the devices are costly and may be impractical, 
particularly in Los Angeles where many high schools have 3,000 or more 
students. 
</P>
<P>
But, after this week's knife attack on the teacher at Olive Vista, he said, 
"Maybe it's something we ought to revisit." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, Los Angeles Unified's police chief, said he is concerned about metal 
detector screening causing long lines outside the school gates. And, he added, 
a detector program would not be foolproof. It would not stop students from 
dumping their weapons in hiding places in the neighborhood and retrieving them 
later in the day, after the metal detectors have been turned off. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you wipe out truancy, you can't stop them from bringing their weapons 
after school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles school district spends $20 million a year on its police force. 
Of the 302 sworn police officers, 143 work in plainclothes and are stationed at 
specific campuses. About 90 uniformed officers patrol in marked cars the 
schools and district offices that do not have officers assigned to them. All 49 
high schools and 51 of the junior high schools have at least one officer each. 
The other 22 junior highs and all 410 elementary schools are served by daily 
patrols. The department also includes 18 investigators. 
</P>
<P>
It currently has 13 vacancies which have been hard to fill largely because many 
applicants do not make it through the required Police Academy training and 
because the district's salaries are not competitive with the Los Angeles Police 
Department and the Sheriff's Department, which the district considers its chief 
rivals for officer candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question we would like to have an officer on every campus," 
Mitchell said. "And there is not an administrator out there who does not 
believe we could use more (officers) in general. But who knows what is enough? 
I remember a period of time when we had as many as four officers assigned to a 
campus and I don't think they were any more effective than with two." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the teachers union president, criticized the deployment of district 
officers, arguing that all should be assigned full-time to campuses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critical of Transfers 
</P>
<P>
He also was critical of the district's policy of transferring students with 
discipline problems from school to school. Noting that the Olive Vista student 
who stabbed his teacher was attending that school on an "opportunity transfer," 
the district's system for temporarily assigning students with discipline or 
other problems to a different campus, he said: "This is what they (the 
district) do. They take a kid who has problems, who is potentially violent, and 
they just transfer him to another school. That doesn't solve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
But Donald V. Bolton, administrator of the district's student attendance and 
adjustment services office, said the transfers are effective. "Very often, a 
transfer does shake (the student) up, it tells the student, 'This is serious.' 
If the kid likes his (neighborhood) school, he'll straighten up" so that he can 
return to it. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, Bolton said, opportunity transfers have brought students to 
campuses where they caused violence. Several years ago, he recalled, Narbonne 
High School in Harbor City received several members of the same gang on 
transfers who subsequently got involved in a shooting incident as they were 
leaving the campus. And, one of the students implicated in a fatal shooting at 
Fairfax High School two years ago also had been on an opportunity transfer, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The school board approves 10,000 to 12,000 such transfers every year. In 
1986-87, the last year for which figures are available, nearly 27% were for 
disobedience and 16.5% were for the protection of the student, a district 
report found. 
</P>
<P>
According to Los Angeles School Board President Roberta Weintraub, fighting 
school violence will require a variety of approaches, including hiring more 
police officers, installing a telephone in every classroom and training school 
employees to be alert to potentially dangerous situations. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said a strong principal who sets clear rules for students and enforces 
them is a key. 
</P>
<P>
"One variable seen in all the research," he said, "is that an effective 
principal does run a safe school . . . someone who makes clear what the rules 
are to students and staff and what the consequences of failing to meet those 
expectations are." 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Felson, an associate professor of sociology at USC who has studied 
school crime rates, relates the severity and frequency of violent acts to 
school size. Schools with large enrollments have more crime, he said, so one 
way to attack the problem is by making smaller schools. 
</P>
<P>
"School size is a big contributor. . . . California and Chicago are among the 
worst offenders of common sense in terms of school size," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens of the National Center for School Safety said the most promising 
long-term strategies for reducing school violence involve teaching students 
alternative ways of resolving conflicts. Teaching "simple courtesy, how to get 
along with others, good decision-making skills," can make a difference, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Helen Bernstein, a counselor and teacher at Marshall High School 
in the Los Feliz area, where she said a boy was stabbed two years ago, much of 
the problem is rooted in the home. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a kid, if I had misbehaved and they'd called my parents, I was 
dead," she said. "(Nowadays) I don't know where half the parents are. I can't 
reach them. I'm not putting them down . . . (but) they're doing a lot of things 
and they don't always have time to deal with the school." 
</P>
<P>
Maria Guzman, a San Fernando Valley parent whose daughter will be attending 
Olive Vista Junior High next year, said the schools must not overlook parents 
and the community as part of a lasting solution to school crime. 
</P>
<P>
"The root of the problem is our society. No one wants to hear that. . . . We 
have kids who never learned values. We have to teach parents how to better 
parents."

BLAST MAY MEAN TERRORISM HAS BEEN IMPORTED TO U.S. 
</P>

<P>
After decades of virtual immunity from international terrorism, the United 
States on Friday began analyzing the possibility that a threshold has been 
crossed. 
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. officials stressed the lack of firm evidence that the bombing of 
a Navy captain's van in San Diego was a terrorist attack, the initial reaction 
among counterterrorism and intelligence officials was that this prospect is a 
very serious one. 
</P>
<P>
Should the link be established, "this officially brings terrorism home to the 
United States," a Bush Administration official said. "The potential 
repercussions of this are dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
There was unanimity among experts on the prime suspect for a terrorist strike: 
Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems obvious," a counterterrorism official said. "It's possible that Iran 
contracted out to somebody who was not necessarily Iranian. But the operation 
fits in with both the militancy of Iran these days and the promise to get 
revenge" by Iranian officials last summer after the Navy cruiser Vincennes shot 
down an Iranian airliner over the Persian Gulf. The van destroyed by bomb 
blasts was being driven by the wife of the commander of the Vincennes, Will C. 
Rogers III. 
</P>
<P>
The bombing clearly took the Bush Administration by surprise. An international 
alert was recently issued to U.S. military and diplomatic facilities on four 
continents warning of potential Libyan attacks on April 15, the anniversary of 
the 1986 U.S. bombing raid on Libya. And after the Iranian airliner was shot 
down last July, killing all 290 on board, U.S. intelligence picked up 
widespread indications that pro-Iranian groups were conducting reconnaissance 
of American diplomatic missions in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But there was virtually no suggestion that foreign elements have planned to hit 
a U.S. target inside this country, a counterterrorism official said. The State 
Department also reported that Rogers had received no recent threats. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, one Bush Administration official said, there are reasons to believe 
that international terrorism may not have been involved in the van blast. "To 
go after a military man was brazen and rather obvious. It is too obvious," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But in a reflection of the pervasive mood here, he added that, if the bombing 
is proven to be a terrorist's work, "Something will have to be done. They hit 
us at home and that can't be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
Private terrorism specialists acknowledged that they have considered an attack 
on a U.S. target at home almost inevitable. "There have been a whole bunch of 
(unsuccessful) attempts in the past," Rand Corp. terrorism specialist Bruce 
Hoffman said. "Most law enforcement agencies have long been saying that it was 
just a matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of foreign groups have tried to hit U.S. targets since terrorism became 
a weapon of modern warfare in 1968. The most recent was Yu Kikumura, a Japanese 
Red Army member arrested a year ago and later convicted of planning to bomb a 
military recruiting station in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
An FBI official said Friday that there was another attempted terrorist act in 
the United States involving "a Mideast country" that was headed off by agents 
last year. The official declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, two Libyan exchange students were arrested in Philadelphia in 
possession of weapons. Authorities believe they had planned to attack either 
U.S. facilities in Washington or Libyan dissidents in this country. In 1979, 
eight Iranians were arrested at the Baltimore airport. Based on maps in their 
possession, U.S. authorities suspected that they planned to seize the airport 
and take hostages. 
</P>
<P>
But all previous attempts by foreign groups have been preempted, according to 
Neil C. Livingstone, adjunct professor of national security at Georgetown 
University. "They've usually been caught at the stage of buying explosives or 
arms, or shortly thereafter." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign groups have launched attacks on foreign targets in the United States, 
according to Rand terrorism researcher Karen Gardela. In 1973, the Palestinian 
Black September group attempted to bomb El Al airlines at Kennedy Airport, an 
El Al office in Queens and an Israeli branch bank in New York. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, two Iranian dissidents were assassinated in Washington and Los 
Angeles, allegedly by followers of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, international terrorists did not have to come here as they had 
enough targets abroad. It may be that things are changing. We've seen 
indications of this most recently in Yu Kikumura's arrest," Hoffman noted. 
</P>
<P>
Terrorism experts said they fear that if the van bombing is proven to be a 
terrorist attack, other such incidents may follow. "Terrorists tend to be 
imitative rather than innovative," Hoffman said. "So in that respect, this 
incident may prompt others to follow suit." 
</P>
<P>
Any strong evidence of terrorism will put the Bush Administration under serious 
pressure to act, U.S. officials acknowledged. During the Reagan Administration, 
Vice President Bush headed the first U.S. task force on terrorism. Its final 
report vowed to "win the war" against terrorism with tough new measures. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of an Iranian link to the van blast was underscored by the 
threats of revenge voiced openly by Iranian officials after the airliner was 
shot down by the U.S. warship, which mistook it for an Iranian fighter plane. 
</P>
<P>
"The element of blood vengeance is so strong in Shiite culture that I find it 
hard to believe it was anything other than an Iranian attack," Livingstone 
said. "There's always a symmetry to the way the Iranians operate." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, FBI official Oliver B. Revell warned a Senate subcommittee 
that at least 200 "hard-core" Iranian nationals in the United States were under 
surveillance because of their loyalties to the Islamic Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 30,000 Iranians in this country on student visas and another 30,000 here 
illegally, he said, up to 15,000 are sympathetic to the current government. 
Many receive government funding or are affiliated with hard-line Iranian groups 
such as the Revolutionary Guards. 
</P>
<P>
He also warned: "We cannot control our borders, even for our own 
self-protection." 
</P>
<P>
Some government analysts noted that the explosive device that destroyed the van 
was "amateurish" and therefore did not fit the pattern of sophisticated Iranian 
bombings elsewhere. But others suggested that this approach fits another 
pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"What we learned from the Kikumura case is that their training overseas 
involves just that. They learn how to make simple, unsophisticated bombs using 
ordinary ingredients that are easy to get," Hoffman said.

BOMB BLOWS UP VAN DRIVEN BY WIFE OF VINCENNES CAPTAIN; SHE ESCAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The wife of Capt. Will Rogers III, skipper of the San Diego-based Vincennes, 
escaped unharmed Friday morning moments before a pipe bomb exploded under her 
van, igniting a fire that gutted her vehicle at a busy La Jolla intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after the 7:40 a.m. explosion, the FBI took control of the investigation, 
suspecting that the bombing might be an act of "domestic terrorism" linked to 
the Vincennes' accidental downing of an Iranian civilian airliner in the 
Persian Gulf last July, killing 290. The Navy and Marine Corps tightened 
security at every military installation in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly it raises the question whether there was a terrorist group involved 
in this," said Gary Laturno, an FBI spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Motive Yet 
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility for the bombing, a federal law enforcement 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point in time, we have no motive; we have no suspect," said Thomas A. 
Hughes, special agent in charge of the FBI in San Diego. "We do not rule out 
the possibility of retribution against Capt. Rogers." 
</P>
<P>
However, a senior Defense Department official said that there was "no evidence" 
of a terrorist connection Friday, and some law enforcement officials described 
the bombing as "amateurish." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, federal officials acknowledged that the incident followed an FBI 
lookout report issued in San Diego in late December for a Syrian national 
allegedly linked to the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 259 
passengers and crew members in Scotland last year. 
</P>
<P>
A copy of the FBI document, obtained by The Times, said the Los Angeles FBI 
office had received an anonymous phone call alleging that the Syrian, 
identified as Farwan Abdin, was "involved in or responsible for the Flight 103 
bombing over Scotland." 
</P>
<P>
The FBI added: "Also mentioned were Navy quarters or TV station. No further 
information given." 
</P>
<P>
The FBI's assessment at the time was that the call was "shoddy" but that 
efforts should be made to locate Abdin. Officials said Friday that a serious 
investigation of the call was never launched. 
</P>
<P>
The Rogerses were being protected Friday night by the Naval Investigative 
Service and other Navy personnel at an undisclosed location. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not home, and we will not disclose their location," said Chief Craig 
Huebler, a Navy spokesman. "And we won't discuss it beyond that. That gets into 
security, and you can understand the sensitivity to that." 
</P>
<P>
He said that no special security precautions had been undertaken for Rogers, 
crew members and their families after the Vincennes returned to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should the Vincennes crew be treated any different?" he said. "There was 
nothing to indicate a threat to the crew or to their families." 
</P>
<P>
All 360 sailors assigned to the Vincennes were alerted by their commanders 
Friday morning of the bomb in the Rogerses' van and urged to take whatever 
precautions they deemed necessary, Huebler said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and Navy officials said Rogers and his wife telephoned their son, Bill 
Rogers, at an eastern university, where he is a student. They assured him that 
they were safe. 
</P>
<P>
After the bombing Friday, an FBI spokesman said the Rogerses' van was usually 
driven by Sharon Rogers, but two highly placed law enforcement sources told The 
Times that Will Rogers drove his wife's van to a doughnut shop without incident 
about an hour before the blast. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred while the van was in the left-turn lane on Genesee 
Avenue, south of La Jolla Village Drive. A law enforcement official, who asked 
not to be identified, said Sharon Rogers told investigators that she pulled up 
behind three or four cars stopped at a red light at the intersection and then 
suddenly heard two popping sounds. 
</P>
<P>
The official said she believed that her van had been struck in the rear by 
another car, so she got out and walked to the back of the van to look for 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
"And then it all went up," the official said. "That's all there was to it. 
There were holes everywhere, and there was plenty of burn." 
</P>
<P>
The explosion propelled metal fragments through the roof of the white Toyota 
and ignited a fire that destroyed the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
One law enforcement source said several construction workers nearby reported 
that moments after the explosion, a red car quickly made a U-turn over the 
traffic median on Genesee and sped from the scene. No other description of the 
car was available, but witnesses said there were four people in it. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have been a guy with a remote-control device who popped the bomb," he 
said, "or it could have been somebody who saw the explosion and was trying not 
to get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers, 50, was on her way to her job as a fourth-grade teacher at La 
Jolla Country Day School when the bomb went off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Vehicles Undamaged 
</P>
<P>
Though the van was surrounded on three sides by other vehicles, none of them 
were damaged, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe she got out just as it blew," said Kurt Lent, a laborer who was 
walking down a dirt embankment toward the vehicle as it exploded. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers was dazed but walking under her own power, when the laborers 
reached her. They took her to a pickup truck, where she told them that she was 
the van's sole occupant and asked them to call her husband. Will Rogers arrived 
at the scene within a few minutes, and police took the couple to the San Diego 
Police Department's Northern Division headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"She looked like she'd just been rear-ended or something," said Charles Archer, 
one of two masonry workers to reach Rogers first. "She was surprised and 
shocked, but she wasn't burned and she wasn't bleeding." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police and FBI agents rushed to the Rogerses' home on Sherlock Court, 
checking two other vehicles and the home with dogs specially trained to sniff 
for explosives. Investigators also used mirrors to look beneath the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Two law enforcement sources said Will Rogers left the couple's home about 6:30 
a.m. and drove in the van to a doughnut shop. He returned, drank coffee with 
his wife, and then Sharon Rogers, who usually drove the van, left in the 
vehicle, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
When Sharon Rogers was interviewed, one law enforcement source said, she was 
nervous and shaken, but she did not immediately connect the explosion with any 
possible retaliation for her husband's role in shooting down the Iranian 
jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
The official also said that the van had been parked in the driveway overnight, 
but that neither the Rogerses nor any neighbors reported prowlers near the 
vehicle. He also said the Rogerses have a family watchdog. 
</P>
<P>
"The dog didn't bark, and the dog barks at everybody," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said Sharon Rogers told investigators that her family had received no 
threats since the airplane was downed. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no threats, nothing," he said. "That's what's funny. If you're 
getting telephone calls in the middle of the night and threatening letters and 
graffiti, you would worry. But here there was nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, the FBI declined comment on most aspects of the investigation, but 
at a press conference, the FBI's Hughes said, "An explosive device exploded in 
the vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
However, two law enforcement sources said one or two pipe bombs had been placed 
on the transmission under the van. 
</P>
<P>
"If she didn't get out like that . . . well, she was very, very lucky," one 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he and other investigators determined that the two initial loud bangs 
apparently came from one or two explosive devices, and that the apparatus was 
connected under the van's transmission. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that most of the van's damage resulted from the fire, which he said 
has led investigators to believe that either low-intensity explosives were 
planted on the vehicle or that only a small amount of high-intensity explosives 
were used. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours, San Diego Fire Department officials confirmed that the blast was 
caused by a pipe bomb. Archer said he found a flattened, 2-by-3-inch section of 
metal pipe near the curb and turned it over to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The Vincennes, a guided-missile cruiser based in San Diego, returned from its 
six-month Persian Gulf deployment last October. It remains in port with Rogers 
as its skipper. 
</P>
<P>
As the Vincennes exchanged fire with Iranian speedboats last July 3, Iran Air 
Flight 655 appeared on the U.S. warship's high-tech radar system. After the 
plane failed to respond to warnings on civilian and military channels, Rogers 
gave the order to fire. 
</P>
<P>
That decision, he said later, was in defense of his ship and crew. But the 
aircraft that Rogers feared was an Iranian F-14 fighter was actually an Airbus 
A300. All aboard were killed when the plane was knocked out of the air by a 
Vincennes missile. 
</P>
<P>
After the downing of the plane, Iran said it would seek retribution for the 
deaths of the innocent civilians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Threats 
</P>
<P>
However, Navy spokesmen in San Diego said Friday that no threats had been made 
against Rogers, the Vincennes or any of its crew members since the ship 
returned to San Diego. The Vincennes and Rogers received some "negative" mail 
last July, shortly after the Iranian plane was shot down, a spokesman said. The 
mail was critical of the Vincennes' handling of the incident but did not 
contain threats, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Vincennes returned to San Diego, Rogers has been overseeing routine 
ship maintenance and training in preparation for its next deployment. The Navy 
does not disclose the dates any of its ships will be deployed, but surface 
ships normally work in 18-month cycles, spending about six months at sea and 
the remainder of the time at or near their home ports. 
</P>
<P>
Terrorism experts believe that the bombing of Pan American Flight 103 may have 
been retribution for the Vincennes' shooting down of the Iranian jetliner. But 
no organization that authorities thought capable of the act has claimed 
responsibility for the bombing of the Pan Am aircraft.

U.S. CATHOLICS EXPECT MORE THAN 'PAY, PRAY,' POPE TOLD 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vatican cardinals on Friday assailed threats to family life and morality in the 
United States, and an American bishop told the Pope that American Roman 
Catholics expect more from their religion than "paying and praying." 
</P>
<P>
Theological maneuverings behind them, three dozen American bishops and Vatican 
prelates got down to basics with Pope John Paul II, exploring the concerns of 
American Catholics over issues such as marriage, divorce, sex, pornography, 
abortion, feminism and the role of women in the church. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans dueled with a cardinal from the Curia, the church's highest 
administrative body, over the granting of annulments to divorced Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
For the third straight day, the Pope was an avid listener, straining to catch 
the quickly spoken English of the Americans, and at times asking them to speak 
more slowly. On Thursday, a spokesman said, the pontiff had become so engrossed 
in the deliberations that he was half an hour late for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's discussions underlined again the basic cultural differences between 
American prelates trying to preach Catholicism in a way acceptable to their 
society and a Vatican Curia firmly sustaining traditional church principles. 
</P>
<P>
After back-room jockeying that had continued all week, the Americans won 
agreement to make available to the press the full texts of American and curial 
presentations from the eight discussion sessions completed through Friday. 
Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the participants on both sides had agreed 
unanimously to make the texts public. 
</P>
<P>
The bishops will concelebrate Mass with the Pope this morning at the tomb of 
St. Peter. Then there will be two final discussion sessions and a papal address 
to climax the extraordinary conference called to ease strains between the 
53-million-member American church and Rome. 
</P>
<P>
In a strongly worded address Friday, unusual in the specificity of its language 
and examples, Cardinal Edouard Gagnon, the Vatican's ranking official concerned 
with families, criticized American Catholics who surrender to the loose morals 
of the society around them. 
</P>
<P>
Gagnon denounced "the degrading of moral values vehicled by cinema and TV 
shows, which pretend to depict normal American life." He cited the TV series 
"Dallas" as an example. 
</P>
<P>
Reciting social evils often denounced by the Vatican, the 71-year-old 
French-Canadian cleric stressed their prevalence in American society today. He 
decried what he called an American contraceptive mentality and called for 
greater education for chastity. He called too for the promotion of women within 
the church but warned that "ideological feminism has a deleterious influence on 
the family." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Promiscuity Encouraged' 
</P>
<P>
"A new challenge is offered to the church by the efforts of Planned Parenthood 
to set up school-based clinics for abortion referral and contraception," Gagnon 
complained. "Planned parenthood programs and sex education in no way resolve 
the problem of teen-age pregnancies, but rather increase it by encouraging 
promiscuity." 
</P>
<P>
The American speaker in the session on the family, San Francisco Archbishop 
John Quinn, acknowledged the many challenges to marriage and the family in the 
United States, including "the growing efforts to legalize 'marriages' between 
persons of the same sex. 
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless," he said, "the church is making serious and effective efforts to 
confront these challenges and fulfill its mission of evangelization." 
</P>
<P>
Inveighing against the "prevalent divorce mentality" in the United States, 
Gagnon said church tribunals with authority to annul marriages had become 
overworked there. 
</P>
<P>
"Women religious can be very helpful in dealing with marriage cases, but we 
have to be careful that their tender hearts do not play tricks on them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Dating Services' 
</P>
<P>
Some church ministries to divorced Catholics who are not free to remarry, he 
said, have "degenerated into dating services." 
</P>
<P>
Italian Cardinal Achille Silvestrini criticized the American church for 
granting too many annulments. 
</P>
<P>
"One may deduce," he said, "that various tribunals in the United States have 
introduced their own method, not fully in conformity with the Code of Canon Law 
in instructing marriage cases." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Silvestrini said, of 45,632 annulments granted by tribunals around the 
world, 36,180 were in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Vatican briefers told reporters, Archbishop Roger M. Mahony noted 
that in Los Angeles last year, judges found no grounds to hear the overwhelming 
majority of about 13,000 annulment applications, and only about 1,000 were 
granted in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Edward O'Meara of Indianapolis and Cardinal Edmund Szoka of Detroit 
also defended the probity of American tribunals, the briefers said, and Szoka 
invited the Vatican to send a delegation to examine them in action. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, the Americans have stressed the singularity of their culture 
and the difficulties of preaching spirituality in a fast-moving, materialistic 
society. Archbishop Patrick Flores of San Antonio returned to the democratic 
theme Friday in a discussion on the role of the laity as agents of 
evangelization. 
</P>
<P>
The life of American Catholics as active participants in a democracy, Flores 
said, "is quite different from our hierarchical mode of life, which for a long 
time expected Catholics to limit their involvement to paying and praying only." 
</P>
<P>
Flores noted that American Catholics live side by side with other Christians, 
and added: "They see their non-Catholic brothers and sisters participating as 
preachers almost from the moment they are baptized. They also see them active 
in so many other ways." 
</P>
<P>
The very roots of American Catholicism complicate its attempts to grow while 
coping with societal changes, the Texas archbishop told the Pope and his 
cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
"The Catholic experience in the U.S.," he said, "was one of an immigrant church 
needing to protect itself against a society that was predominantly Anglo and 
Protestant. Because we have been more self-preserving than outward looking, we 
have struggled with the reaching out needed to be evangelizers." 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging difficulties facing the American church, Vatican cardinals 
urged caution in the search for ways to confront them. In a session on liturgy 
and the sacraments, Curia Cardinal Eduardo Martinez Somalo lamented that 
Americans seemed to be losing their "sense of sin." 
</P>
<P>
He voiced reservations about experimental Masses, overzealous attempts to 
depersonalize liturgical texts, and also "the direct service of women at the 
altar." An American attempt to win approval for altar girls is being studied by 
a Vatican commission. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez Somalo also complained about the "over-utilization" of general 
absolution instead of individual confession. Archbishop Daniel V. Kucera of 
Dubuque replied, "General absolution has been used quite sparingly in the U.S. 
despite vocal but inaccurate claims to the contrary." 
</P>
<P>
Closing sessions today before the papal address will examine ecumenism and 
evangelization, and the use of the mass media for evangelization of 
non-churchgoers who have become known, in the jargon of American bishops, as 
"the unchurched."

An Air Ontario jet with 69 aboard crashed into trees and burst into flames 
shortly after takeoff during a snowstorm Friday, killing up to 23 people, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-six people survived the crash of the Winnipeg-bound Fokker F-28, said 
provincial police Constable Bill Brayshaw. One person was confirmed dead and 22 
others were unaccounted for and presumed dead for after several hours of 
searching in deep snow and rough terrain. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 22 people we cannot locate," Brayshaw said. "They may still be in 
the aircraft. Anybody in the plane I'm sure is deceased." 
</P>
<P>
Brayshaw said the aircraft caught fire after impact, delaying rescue 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said 65 passengers and four crew were on Flight 363, which originated 
in Thunder Bay, Ontario. The jet clipped treetops and exploded minutes after 
takeoff, witnesses and authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities repeatedly revised the passenger and crew figures, first saying 69 
were aboard, then 61 and again 69. Police Sgt. Tom Varga said the revisions 
were based on information coming from Air Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
Brayshaw said the number of people on board was finally determined from ticket 
sales. Rescue operations stopped for the night and were to resume at first 
light today, Hugh Syrja, spokesman for Dryden's emergency rescue group, said in 
a phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old, Dutch-built F-28, a twin-engine jet, took off with visibility 
about half a mile, said Norm Pascoe, a spokesman for the Canadian Aviation 
Safety Board in Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
Survivor Danny Godin said upon arrival in Winnipeg by air ambulance that the 
plane "was loaded very heavy. . . . We were delayed in Thunder Bay an hour, and 
we had to take fuel off the airplane because we were above the legal load 
limit." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cuts Wide Swath 
</P>
<P>
The plane cut a swath half a mile long and about 100 feet wide near Dryden, a 
town of 6,500 people on the Trans-Canada Highway about 200 miles northwest of 
Duluth, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, rescuers hampered by the thickly wooded area and more than three feet 
of snow used snowplows and chain saws to look for survivors. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the 46 survivors were taken to hospitals and at least eight were 
in serious condition. A spokesman at 68-bed Dryden District Hospital, which 
aided survivors in the lobby and cafeteria, said many of the injured suffered 
from fractures, burns, bruises and shock. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Broadcast Corp. quoted rescue workers as saying the crash occurred 
in heavy bush country about half a mile off the west end of the runway. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people in the very front of the plane did not get out," Godin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he felt "the plane quiver as we had an air disturbance . . . (and it) 
exploded into flames when it first hit the treetops." 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Saville, general manager of the weekly Dryden Observer, said 
survivors staggered out to a road where they were picked up by emergency crews. 
</P>
<P>
She said rescue crews used snowmobiles to ferry survivors from the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see smoke from two miles away," she said. "When it came down, there 
was smoke." 
</P>
<P>
Roxanne Groves, a nearby resident, heard the aircraft fly over head. 
</P>
<P>
"It was rumbling really bad," she said. "It didn't sound normal and then all of 
a sudden we heard a thump, a good thump. I looked out about five minutes later 
and there was black smoke all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first fatal crash involving a regularly scheduled commercial 
airliner in Canada in 10 years. In 1979, 17 people were killed in Quebec City 
when a Quebecair Fairchild 27 went down. 
</P>
<P>
The worst air disaster in Canada occurred in 1985, when 256 people, mainly 
American servicemen, died in the crash of a chartered Arrow Air DC-8 in 
Newfoundland.

<P>
FIVE EX-GIS IMPLICATED IN PROBE OF EUROPE SPY CASE 
</P>

<P>
Five retired American soldiers are under investigation in an expanding European 
espionage case involving Clyde Lee Conrad, a former U.S. Army sergeant with 
access to North Atlantic Treaty Organization secrets, officials confirmed 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The other soldiers' names could not be learned immediately. But the widening 
number of suspects and reports that Conrad passed documents of a higher secrecy 
classification than he possessed indicates that Conrad's case is more serious 
than reported after his August arrest. Still, "it could have been a lot worse," 
a Pentagon official said. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad, awaiting trial in West Germany on charges of selling NATO war plans, 
was recruited to spy for the Hungarian Intelligence Service by Zoltan Szabo, a 
Hungarian-born American soldier, officials said. All the information provided 
by the alleged spies is presumed to have been passed on to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
A bizarre new aspect of the case is that Conrad, posing as a Hungarian 
intelligence agent, was paid $100,000 by the CIA for information about an 
alleged U.S. Army spy ring working for the Hungarians, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Native of Ohio 
</P>
<P>
The FBI, the chief U.S. agency now handling the case, refused to comment on it, 
as did the Defense Department. West German authorities are handling most of the 
investigation, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad, a 42-year-old native of Sebring, Ohio, was arrested in August by West 
Germany authorities. He had retired from the Army in 1985 after 20 years but 
remained in West Germany where he had spent most of his career and had married 
a West German woman. 
</P>
<P>
In his last five years of service, Conrad had access to secret NATO contingency 
plans for repelling a Soviet invasion and other information. He allegedly sold 
it to the Hungarians for as much as $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested along with two Hungarians, Imre Kercsik, 34, and Sandor 
Kercsik, 48. The Kercsik brothers, medical doctors living in Sweden, acted as 
couriers for the ring throughout Western Europe. They were convicted in Sweden 
last fall of espionage. Though they received relatively light sentences because 
they were not spying against Sweden, the brothers did talk at length about 
their activities, both to Swedish authorities and at their trial, U.S. 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandor Kercsik said that the espionage ring began with Szabo, whom he first met 
in Vienna in 1967. He transmitted military secrets stolen by Szabo for several 
years. Szabo introduced Kercsik to Conrad around 1974, before Szabo retired 
from the military in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coded Messages, Drop Boxes 
</P>
<P>
Szabo lived in Austria after retirement but since has fled to Hungary, where he 
cannot be reached by American or West German authorities, officials confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad, meanwhile, transmitted hundreds of documents through the Kercsiks in 
more than a decade of espionage. The doctors used an elaborate system of coded 
messages and drop boxes to move the stolen papers. When they were arrested, 
code books and telecommunication equipment were found in their home. 
</P>
<P>
Some documents reportedly deal with U.S. nuclear missiles and their bases, 
pipeline supply systems and NATO troop strengths. Conrad had top-secret Army 
clearance, so the papers of a higher classification that he transmitted 
apparently came from the five other soldiers whom he recruited, officials 
speculated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offer to Testify 
</P>
<P>
The Kercsiks have identified pictures of some American soldiers and have 
offered to visit the United States to testify against them, officials 
confirmed. All the suspects reportedly live in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
While Conrad worked for the Hungarians, officials said, he approached CIA 
agents in the guise of a Hungarian intelligence officer, offering to provide 
information on a U.S. Army spy ring selling documents to the Hungarians. 
</P>
<P>
He received money for fictitious information, but paradoxically, the Hungarian 
intelligence service learned of his brazen action and ordered the Kercsiks to 
break off contact with him.

The Soviet Union on Friday accused the FBI of "gross provocation" in detaining 
and expelling a Washington-based Soviet diplomat, and alleged that FBI agents 
forced him from his apartment house without shoes or coat, prevented him from 
calling his embassy for several hours and offered him financial aid if he 
defected. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov refused to rule out the 
possibility that American diplomats might be ordered to leave Moscow in 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. side assumes all the responsibility for what happens in the future," 
he warned. 
</P>
<P>
But official Soviet reaction to the expulsion of Lt. Col. Yuri N. Pakhtusov was 
notably muted on two counts. For one thing, Gerasimov was careful to blame the 
FBI, not the Bush Administration, for what he called "a hostile act." 
</P>
<P>
"I would classify this as an instance of gross provocation staged by those 
people in the United States who are reluctant to accept improvements in 
Soviet-American relations," Gerasimov said. "Of course, the full responsibility 
will rest on U.S. special services for what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the Soviet spokesman repeatedly declined to deny that Pakhtusov had 
sought to obtain secret information. Asked three times whether Pakhtusov had 
engaged in espionage, Gerasimov repeated details of the arrest and said that 
Pakhtusov, reportedly a military intelligence officer, "did not carry out any 
actions incompatible with his diplomatic status." 
</P>
<P>
The FBI said that Pakhtusov, 35, took up his post as a military attache in 
Washington last June and two months later contacted an American civilian 
employee of a computer company in an effort to try to acquire documents showing 
how the U.S. government protects secrets in its computer system. The employee 
reported the contact to the FBI and Pakhtusov was placed under surveillance for 
six months, the FBI said. Neither the employee nor the company was named. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Received Document 
</P>
<P>
Pakhtusov was arrested Wednesday after he received classified documents from 
the American employee, according to U.S. officials, who said that no classified 
information had reached the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Jack F. Matlock Jr. dismissed as nonsense any 
allegation that the FBI had behaved in a hostile manner. 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. diplomat here observed: "The expulsion was a perfectly legitimate 
act, showing simply that we take our internal security seriously. It shouldn't 
have any repercussions on Soviet-American relations." 
</P>
<P>
But the official Soviet news agency Tass said the allegation that Pakhtusov was 
a spy was a "sin against truth," and added: 
</P>
<P>
"What is behind this affair? It is only left for us to presume that not 
everybody in the United States is pleased with the long-awaited thaw in 
relations between the two superpowers. Not everyone, apparently, is pleased 
that ever-growing numbers of Americans are lately showing sympathy with what is 
happening in the Soviet Union, displaying unconcealed interest in the ongoing 
processes in our country." 
</P>
<P>
Pakhtusov was identified by U.S. sources as a member of the GRU, the 
intelligence branch of the Red Army. Soviet officials refused to confirm or 
deny this. 
</P>
<P>
Tass and Gerasimov offered differing accounts of Pakhtusov's arrest. Tass said 
Pakhtusov was arrested Wednesday night when he left his apartment to carry out 
the garbage. The news agency said he wore only light trousers, an undershirt 
and slippers. 
</P>
<P>
"Pakhtusov was dragged to a car and handcuffed," Tass said. "He was not allowed 
to go back and get dressed, or to see his wife, who remained home with his two 
children not knowing what had happened to her husband, who had gone out for 
only a few seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said Pakhtusov was visiting an American friend who lives in his 
apartment house when "FBI agents forced their way into the flat. . . . 
Pakhtusov was subjected to physical force. He was put into handcuffs. He was 
even denied the basic right to immediately get in contact with the Soviet 
Embassy and to report this incident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Barefoot in the Cold 
</P>
<P>
"Pakhtusov was not allowed to put on his overcoat and shoes, despite the cold 
weather. He was brought to the FBI, where for a long time he was denied the 
opportunity to contact Soviet representatives. The staff of the FBI attempted 
to persuade Pakhtusov to defect and promised financial assistance in exchange." 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said the expulsion of the diplomat was "incompatible with the new, 
constructive atmosphere which has been emerging in Soviet-U.S. relations." 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III met this week in Vienna with Soviet 
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. It was their first formal meeting 
since Baker came to office, and the two plan more talks in Moscow in May. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman declined to respond in 
detail to the Soviet allegations about the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason for our action was very simple," Redman said. "He (Pakhtusov) was 
caught red-handed with the goods, and no amount of verbiage can change that." 
</P>
<P>
Redman said the Soviets "have protested the expulsion but have advised us that 
Pakhtusov will be leaving as requested. There is no reason to believe it should 
affect our relationship. The Soviets know, as they always have, that we will 
protect our national security whenever it's threatened." 
</P>
<P>
The last time a Soviet diplomat was expelled from the United States was in 
December, 1987, when Mikhail Katkov, a middle-level official at the Soviet U.N. 
Mission in New York City, was sent home as an alleged spy.

SOVIET EXPERT TELLS HOUSE PANEL OF UNILATERAL WEAPONS CUTS BY KREMLIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Soviet arms expert, only the second Soviet official ever to testify formally 
before Congress, said Friday that Moscow is making unilateral cuts in its 
naval, chemical and short-range nuclear missile forces in addition to the 
500,000-troop reduction announced last December. 
</P>
<P>
It is also reconfiguring remaining forces to be more defensively oriented, said 
Andrei A. Kokoshin, a deputy director of a Soviet institute that studies the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the cuts described by Kokoshin are relatively minor and have been under 
way for several years. But he invited reciprocal American cuts to sustain the 
momentum in arms control begun with the 1987 treaty eliminating ground-launched 
medium-range nuclear missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee before 
which Kokoshin appeared, asked whether the unilateral Soviet moves mean that 
Moscow is skeptical about the chances of success of the new Vienna talks to 
reduce conventional forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations will be very difficult," Kokoshin replied carefully. He cited 
the large number of countries involved in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization-Warsaw Pact discussions, and the large number of weapons systems 
of different characteristics to be balanced against each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goals could be met by negotiation or by parallel steps" to reduce the 
armaments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
With American flags draped behind him, Kokoshin was invited by Aspin to testify 
as part of what Aspin hopes will be a series of exchanges of U.S. and Soviet 
experts on military affairs and arms control. 
</P>
<P>
The only previous appearance before Congress by a Soviet official occurred in 
1986 when an articulate young diplomat from the embassy here, Vitaly Churkin, 
testified on the nuclear accident at Chernobyl. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts listed by Kokoshin have been "largely confirmed by the U.S. 
intelligence community," a congressional source said in a briefing to the same 
House committee a day earlier. The cuts, as reported by Kokoshin: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Withdrawal of 24 short-range (under 300 miles) nuclear missiles from East 
Germany, and a halt in programs to modernize these "tactical" weapons. He did 
not identify the type to be withdrawn, but the Soviets and their allies have 
more than 300 missiles of two varieties, the Scud and the SS-21, deployed 
there. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet move is an obvious effort to maintain pressure on West Germany to 
further delay approval of a new version of the U.S. Lance short-range missile 
that would be deployed on its territory and to support Soviet calls for 
negotiations to eliminate these nuclear systems. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Destruction and dismantlement of the Soviet chemical weapon stockpiles. 
Kokoshin said that the work began this year, as previously promised. U.S. 
authorities believe that only obsolete and deteriorating weapons are being 
destroyed, and Aspin noted later that the Soviets have not renounced continued 
production of chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reductions in naval vessels, particularly in the Far East, where 40 vessels 
have been taken out of service between 1984 and 1988. Kokoshin was not specific 
about what kind of ships were removed. The Soviet Pacific fleet includes more 
than 300 surface combatants and auxiliaries, including two aircraft carriers 
and almost 100 submarines. 
</P>
<P>
Kokoshin added details on the pace of the major Soviet reductions in East 
Europe that were announced by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the 
United Nations last December, and he described reorganization efforts of 
remaining Soviet forces. 
</P>
<P>
Of the half-million-troop reduction, Kokoshin explained that 450,000 men would 
come from Soviet forces in the Soviet Union, while 50,000 would come from 
Soviet forces in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, over a two-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Soviets will eliminate 10,000 tanks, 8,500 artillery pieces 
and 800 combat aircraft, also over a two-year period. About 5,300 of the tanks 
will come from six Soviet tank divisions in three East European nations. 
</P>
<P>
These thinned-out divisions will be equipped with more anti-tank and 
anti-aircraft weapons, Kokoshin said. 
</P>
<P>
"This changes the standard division from offensive to defensive" orientation, 
he said.

TROOP PRESENCE, WARNINGS BRING FORCED CALM TO TIBETAN CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A massive military and police presence, together with clear warnings that 
demonstrations would be crushed, brought an enforced calm to the Tibetan 
capital of Lhasa on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A string of 72 vehicles carrying more than 1,200 troops drove through the 
streets of Lhasa in the morning in a show of force, according to the official 
China News Service. The report said the convoy included 42 military trucks, 10 
vehicles with "automatic rocket guns" and 20 command cars. 
</P>
<P>
Arrests continued of Tibetans suspected of participating in three days of 
pro-independence demonstrations and riots early this week, according to Lhasa 
residents who spoke by telephone with reporters in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
With martial law in effect, most Tibetans too frightened to talk and nearly all 
foreigners expelled from the city, no estimates were available on the scale of 
Friday's arrests. Tibetans who spoke with foreigners in Lhasa on Thursday said 
they believed that up to 1,000 people had been arrested by that time. 
</P>
<P>
At least 16 people were killed in this week's clashes, according to official 
count, while foreign tourists have said it appears more likely that 20 to 50 
died. Most casualties, according to foreign witnesses and official Chinese 
reports, came when police fired into rioting crowds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
30th Anniversary of Uprising 
</P>
<P>
There had been widespread expectations both among Tibetan pro-independence 
activists and Lhasa authorities that there might be major protests Friday to 
mark the 30th anniversary of the beginning of an abortive uprising in which 
Tibetans sought to throw off Chinese rule. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign tourists who flew Friday from Lhasa to Chengdu, in neighboring Sichuan 
province, told a reporter for United Press International that authorities had 
put up posters Thursday night warning that the army would use force if there 
were further demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
The exiled Dalai Lama, traditionally the temporal and spiritual leader of 
Tibet, issued a statement Friday from his headquarters at Dharmsala, India, 
calling on Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to personally intervene to ease the 
crisis in Lhasa. 
</P>
<P>
"I urge your personal intervention for bringing an immediate end to the 
repressive measures against innocent Tibetans and lifting of martial law in 
Lhasa," the Buddhist leader said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Willing to Open Talks 
</P>
<P>
The message, which was delivered to the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi and also 
released to the press, reaffirmed the Dalai Lama's willingness to open 
negotiations with China about Tibet's future. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my hope that the leadership in China will have the wisdom to realize the 
true feelings of the Tibetan people and have the strength and courage to 
rectify past mistakes," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Tibet, which over the centuries was sometimes independent and sometimes part of 
the Chinese empire, had de facto independence from the 1911 fall of the Qing 
Dynasty until the Chinese Communists established firm control in 1951. It was 
during the abortive 1959 rebellion, in which Tibetans sought to shake off 
Chinese rule, that the Dalai Lama fled to India. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. in Dharmsala on Friday, the 
Dalai Lama said that before this week's violence erupted, he had received 
indications that China might agree to open talks on Tibet's future with him 
sometime this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I don't know, due to this recent event," he said. "Otherwise, there are 
indications, I think within a few months, say two or three months, we may start 
to talk at Geneva. But now I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama said that a few months ago, he "received some information that 
among Chinese leaders, there is one group of people who feel the moderate and 
lenient policy has failed in Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
"So, you see, they prefer more ruthlessness or repressive action," he said. "My 
worry is whether that kind of hard-liner attitude now has become more 
influential."

VIETNAM ASKED TO CURB EXODUS OF 'BOAT PEOPLE'

Delegates from 30 nations have drafted a plan asking Vietnam to curtail the 
exodus of "boat people" from its shores, officials at an international 
conference said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the group, which held a three-day meeting here this week, ruled out 
forcibly repatriating asylum-seekers who cannot show they are fleeing political 
persecution, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The rules are very clear . . . whenever refugees are repatriated, it has to be 
on a voluntary basis," said Jean Pierre Hocke, the U.N. high commissioner for 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
The delegates laid out the measures in a draft plan for consideration at the 
International Conference on Indochinese Refugees, to be held June 13-14 in 
Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Majid Mohammed said that the plan would help "provide durable 
solutions to the Indochinese refugee problem." 
</P>
<P>
The draft plan suggests that Vietnam launch a campaign stressing the risks and 
hardships of fleeing by boat and work to end illegal departures by "boat 
people." It also calls on Vietnam to make legal departures easier. 
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and other countries in the 
region have agreed to provide temporary asylum for refugees. Western nations 
were urged to take in refugees left in camps. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said the Vietnamese delegation had agreed at the conference to 
take back anyone who wants to return voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
Western delegations said they might take in additional refugees and step up 
financial aid to help implement the plan.

CHENEY: HIGHLY AMBITIOUS 'STRAIGHT ARROW' WITH AN INTELLECTUAL BENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush could not have found anyone more distinctly different from John 
Tower than Rep. Dick Cheney (R-Wyo.) in his search for a new nominee as defense 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is Cheney a man with a squeaky-clean reputation, but unlike Tower -- 
who spent his entire political career anticipating that he would someday run 
the Pentagon -- the Wyoming congressman apparently never considered that 
possibility until he received a telephone call Thursday from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
A soft-spoken, intensely ambitious man with an intellectual bent, Cheney, 48, 
who serves as assistant House minority leader, by all accounts has been on a 
fast track in recent years toward becoming minority leader -- and perhaps even 
Speaker, if the Republicans could reclaim control of the House within the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Never in Service 
</P>
<P>
Although he has served for five years on the House intelligence committee and 
was a leading light on the 1987 Iran-Contra investigating committee, Cheney has 
never been closely identified with Pentagon issues. Nor did he ever serve in 
the armed services. 
</P>
<P>
His only genuine involvement with military affairs -- other than his House 
votes on defense bills -- was his presence at National Security Council 
meetings during his tenure as White House chief of staff during 1975 and 1976 
under President Gerald R. Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Elected to the House in 1978 after Ford's defeat, Cheney also has a more 
conservative reputation than Tower and is viewed as a leader of the staunch 
right-wing faction in the House. In fact, his voting record has won him 100% 
ratings with the American Conservative Union and 0% ratings from the liberal 
Americans for Democratic Action. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Reason to Worry 
</P>
<P>
As far as Cheney's personal life is concerned, Bush has no reason to worry that 
the Senate will uncover any evidence of drinking or womanizing, as it did with 
Tower. In fact, many of his House colleagues use the same term to describe him: 
"straight arrow." 
</P>
<P>
According to Bush, Cheney also has weathered intensive FBI investigations into 
his background before two other government appointments in the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney is a Methodist and a family man with two daughters. And when it comes to 
the question of whether he supports equal opportunity for women, the Senate 
needs only to look at his wife, Lynne, who heads the National Endowment for the 
Humanities. According to an aide, it was his family responsibilities that kept 
him out of the military in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, given his House record, Cheney has few ties to the defense 
industry. In six elections to the House, he has gathered more than $700,000 in 
contributions from political action committees, $104,000 of it from defense 
concerns. The biggest defense contributor is a Chicago-based company, FMC, that 
contributed $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
While he is known as one of the major beneficiaries in Congress of speaking 
fees and honorariums from special interest groups, which added $107,937 to his 
income over the last five years, none of his fees in the last reporting year of 
1987 was derived from defense groups. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Cheney's lack of experience in defense issues, he is known as a quick 
study and a thoughtful man. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from 
the University of Wyoming, and has finished all of the requirements for his 
doctorate except his thesis. In addition, he and his wife have co-authored one 
book, "Kings of the Hill," a study of the office of House Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
The one question that is most frequently raised by his detractors is whether 
Cheney, a native of Lincoln, Neb., is a true Westerner, as he frequently 
portrays himself. Although he always wears cowboy boots -- even with tuxedos -- 
most Washingtonians consider Cheney one of them. Some of his political 
opponents in Wyoming have even branded him a carpetbagger. 
</P>
<P>
After government internships in Wyoming and Wisconsin in the mid-1960s, Cheney 
served in various federal posts in Washington from 1969 until 1973 under 
President Richard M. Nixon, stayed in Washington to work for an investment 
advisory firm in 1973 and 1974 and did not return to Wyoming until after Ford 
left office in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives also view him as a recent convert to their point of view. He 
began his career in Washington as an aide to then-Rep. Donald H. Rumsfeld 
(R-Ill.), a moderate, and succeeded Rumsfeld as White House chief of staff when 
his mentor became defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
But none of his acquaintances would dispute that Cheney is ambitious. Despite 
three heart attacks and a quadruple heart bypass operation last year, he works 
long hours at his job as assistant minority leader, to which he was elected 
last December. 
</P>
<P>
At a White House news conference announcing his nomination, Cheney told 
reporters that he had expected to remain in the House for the bulk of his 
political career and he expressed the view that Republicans will control the 
chamber in the near future. The GOP has been in the minority in the House since 
the 1950s.

Although becoming defense secretary will eliminate the possibility that Cheney 
might someday be Speaker, it could mean that he has refocused his sights on a 
different leadership position and one more easily accessible to a Republican: 
the presidency.

"It makes a lot of sense," a House acquaintance said. "He doesn't come off as 
ambitious because of his calm demeanor, but I think running for President is 
where his ambitions have always been."

HIJACK TRIAL JURY TOLD ORDERS ARE ILLEGAL DEFENSE

The judge in Fawaz Younis' hijacking trial Friday gave the jury stern 
instructions that seemed to undercut the defendant's argument that he was 
justified in taking over an airliner in Beirut in 1985 because he was under 
orders from a Lebanese militia. 
</P>
<P>
"Orders to hijack a plane . . . are illegal orders," U.S. District Judge Aubrey 
E. Robinson Jr. told the jury of seven women and five men. "Obedience to 
illegal orders is no defense." 
</P>
<P>
The judge said Younis should be acquitted only if he did not know that 
hijacking was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Younis has testified that he knew that hijacking was illegal in peacetime and 
that the Amal militia to which he belonged was not at war with Royal Jordanian 
Airlines, the government of Jordan, the two Americans aboard the aircraft or 
any of the other 70 passengers and crew members. 
</P>
<P>
Younis, 30, has pleaded innocent in the case, which is a test of a 1984 statute 
asserting "long-arm" U.S. jurisdiction in cases involving American hostages 
taken overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors sought to convince jurors that Younis knew he was 
committing an illegal act against innocent civilians by seizing control of 
Royal Jordanian Flight 402 on June 11, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the six counts against him, Younis could face life in prison 
plus more than $410,000 in fines, which he does not have money to pay. He has 
been held in isolation since his arrest in September, 1987, and is represented 
by court-appointed counsel.

TEAMSTERS, JUSTICE DEPT. PLAN FINAL EFFORT TO SETTLE SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Labor Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawyers for the Teamsters and the Justice Department will hold last-ditch 
negotiations this weekend aimed at settling the government's massive 
racketeering case against the 1.6-million-member union, according to 
knowledgeable sources. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a substantial majority of the Teamsters executive board condemned a 
separate settlement made by three board members earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
The board resolution, passed in Washington, states that the three members' 
settlement "interfered with and impeded" the Teamsters in the union's defense 
against a racketeering suit filed by the Justice Department seeking to impose a 
federal trusteeship over the union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Censures 3 Members 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, in effect, censures Teamster Secretary-Treasurer Weldon L. 
Mathis, the second-highest official in the union, and Vice Presidents Edward 
Lawson of Vancouver, B.C., and Donald L. West of Birmingham, Ala., for 
"self-serving actions." They were the only three members of the 19-member board 
who voted against the resolution, according to sources who attended the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
No member of the executive board was available for comment. However, Barry 
Feinstein, president of a large New York City Teamster local and director of 
the union's public employee division, decried the actions of Mathis and the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
"The union is in a fight for its life," Feinstein said in a telephone 
interview. "We expect that the executive board will be together, rally 'round 
the flag, like Democrats and Republicans would do if we had an invasion from a 
foreign country." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, a 32-year veteran of the union, said he could remember no prior 
occasion where the union's executive board had publicly chastised some of its 
members in this way. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the executive board declined to take any disciplinary action 
against the three men for fear of being held in contempt by U.S. District Judge 
David N. Edelstein. On Wednesday, Edelstein had ordered the board to call him 
by 1 p.m. Friday and inform him whether it had taken any action against the 
three men, prior to his granting formal approval to the settlement the three 
men arranged with the Justice Department. He approved the agreement later 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Another source close to the board said "the mood in the board meeting was that 
they (Mathis, West and Lawson) had undercut the other defendants and weakened 
them in their negotiations (with the government) by not staying together." 
</P>
<P>
The agreements the three men signed call for reforms in the union's election 
procedures and, if the government prevails in its case, the creation of an 
ethical practices committee to combat corruption in the union. The three union 
officials also agreed not to knowingly associate with the Mafia or any other 
criminal group. 
</P>
<P>
None of the three men had to give up their union posts as a condition of 
settlement. Nor did they agree to testify for the government at trial. In fact, 
Mathis said he would testify for the union if union lawyers asked him. 
</P>
<P>
In late January, three elderly Teamster vice presidents -- Robert H. Holmes of 
Detroit, Maurice R. Schurr of Philadelphia and John Cleveland of Washington -- 
settled with the Justice Department and agreed to resign from the union. They 
were not criticized by their fellow board members. A source close to the board 
said the difference in reaction to the two groups of men was accounted for by 
the fact that Mathis, West and Lawson plan to stay active in the union. 
</P>
<P>
Unless agreement is reached this weekend, a bevy of lawyers for the union and 
the Justice Department will meet at the courthouse in New York's Foley Square 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department suit, filed last June under the Racketeer-Influenced and 
Corrupt Organizations Act, asserts that the Teamsters are dominated by 
organized criminal elements and seeks court supervision of the union until new 
officers can be chosen in a "free and fair election."

CHICAGO MAYORAL RACE RALLY TURNS INTO BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC HARRISON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Political discourse in Chicago often has had the flavor of a street fight. 
</P>
<P>
But this week, Chicago viewers of television news have been greeted with the 
spectacle of a real brawl between supporters of two candidates for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The melee, and the charges of "dirty tricks" and intimidation that have erupted 
since, has enlivened a mayoral campaign that has, by Chicago standards, been in 
something of a slump. 
</P>
<P>
The brawl broke out Thursday night at a rally for Republican candidate Edward 
R. Vrdolyak in a hall in northwest Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Horist, Vrdolyak's press secretary, said that as the candidate began to 
speak, one of a small group of hecklers came toward the podium, made a thumbs 
down sign and shouted an obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Horist said, "things just sort of burst on the scene and there were 
tables and bodies and kids and women flying all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
Vrdolyak blamed Democratic candidate Richard M. Daley, the Cook County state's 
attorney, for the disruption. Then, on Friday, Vrdolyak skipped a radio forum 
with independent candidate Timothy Evans to hold a press conference at which he 
announced that he will seek a federal investigation into Daley's campaign 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
His campaign spokesman said telephoned death threats that Vrdolyak received 
Thursday night after the brawl partially accounted for the change in his 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about the top law enforcement guy in Cook County basically 
scheduling a plan of dirty tricks," Horist said. "It has to be looked at in a 
larger context than just a fistfight." 
</P>
<P>
Daley, who campaigned Friday night with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), 
denied that he had anything to do with the hecklers and suggested that Vrdolyak 
had the most to gain from the controversy. "He needs the publicity," Daley told 
reporters. "Why would I want to disrupt his campaign? I'm going to win this 
election." 
</P>
<P>
Vrdolyak, a controversial former alderman who ran for mayor in 1987, won the 
Republican primary last month as a write-in candidate only six days after 
entering the race. But with the general election April 4, he continues to lag 
far behind Daley and Evans in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican defended himself Friday from accusations that he staged the 
brawl to get on the news. 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone can find any shred of evidence directly or indirectly connecting 
anyone in my campaign with the incident, I would respectfully submit to you 
that I would not want to run for this office," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
He said witnesses recognized several of the hecklers as being members of 
Daley's campaign and said an organizer of the brawl is an assistant state's 
attorney in Daley's office. He said also that the "getaway car" driven by the 
hecklers belonged to an alderman who supports Daley. 
</P>
<P>
Horist said the campaign had been told that Daley's brother, William, a Daley 
campaign official, had instructed Democratic committeemen to picket Vrdolyak 
rallies and heckle him. The Daley campaign denied the accusation.

DON'T RULE OUT IRAN ROLE, EXPERTS WARN 
</P>

<P>
Although terrorists operating out of the Middle East most commonly use more 
powerful explosives, the possibility that the pipe bomb attack on Sharon Rogers 
was ordered by Iran cannot be dismissed, terrorism experts said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I would expect the Iranians to come better equipped, but it's not unheard of 
for terrorists to use pipe bombs," said John Ruggie, an international relations 
professor at UC San Diego. "One example is the attack on U.S. servicemen in 
Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Ruggie said there has also been a trend among international terrorists to shift 
away from dynamite or plastic explosives to avoid leaving clues that could lead 
to their detection. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iranians could be using something other than what they've used in the past 
to make us think it wasn't them," said Ruggie, who has worked as a consultant 
on terrorism and low-intensity conflict for the federal government and the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
G. Allen Greb, associate director of UC San Diego's Institute on Global 
Conflict and Cooperation, agreed. "It might be a group trying to cover its 
tracks by using a cruder device than they would have preferred," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hoffman, a specialist on Middle East terrorism for the Rand Corp. in 
Santa Monica, said he has interviewed terrorists trained in Lebanon who say 
they are specifically ordered to use low-intensity explosives like pipe bombs 
when hitting targets abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"For one thing, these kinds of materials are easily obtained near the victim, 
rather than having to be smuggled in," he said. And, he noted, the Iranians 
have a history of trying to avoid detection for assassinations, as was the case 
in 1980, when a black Muslim was hired to murder then-Shah Mohammed Reza 
Pahlavi's former press attache in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Pipe bombs are also the weapon of choice for domestic radical groups that might 
have sympathy with Iran, Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, groups like Puerto Rican separatists, the Weather Underground, 
anti-Castro Cubans, Armenian nationalists, Croatian liberationists and white 
supremacists have used pipe bombs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember that while a pipe bomb isn't terribly powerful, as bombs go, it can 
be very sophisticated, placed near a gas tank for a secondary explosion and 
using a timing device," Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, for example, a pipe bomb with a timer destroyed an 
Encinitas restaurant in 1982. Pipe bombs with timers have been found in 
automobiles. Just a few weeks ago, a pipe bomb was discovered strapped to a car 
in El Cajon, set to explode when the driver used his right turn signal. 
</P>
<P>
Easy and cheap to assemble, pipe bombs are the most common kind of illicit 
explosive used in the United States. The Federal Bureau of Investigation says 
pipe bomb devices constituted up to 60% of the 900-plus bombings in the United 
States last year. 
</P>
<P>
Pipe bombs were used in attempts in 1987 to destroy several San Diego County 
abortion clinics. The bombs were to be detonated by candles acting as crude 
timing devices. 
</P>
<P>
Organized crime hit men are thought by authorities to favor heavier firepower 
like dynamite in order to inflict greater property damage and take fewer 
chances of the victim surviving. The fatal bombing of Arizona newsman Don 
Bolles in 1976, done in retaliation for his probes of organized crime, was 
accomplished by dynamite. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids use pipe bombs, amateurs use pipe bombs, guys with grudges use pipe 
bombs," said Sgt. Conrad Grayson of the San Diego Sheriff's Department arson 
and explosives unit. "Professionals use dynamite or, if they can get it, 
plastic explosives." 
</P>
<P>
Plastic explosive is the most deadly but also the most difficult to obtain. It 
is illegal for civilian use and must be stolen from the military or bought on 
the black market. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had young servicemen willing to sell some for dope," Grayson said. 
</P>
<P>
A pipe bomb is simply a small length of pipe -- plastic or metal -- with either 
black powder or smokeless powder, both commercially available, inside. The pipe 
is capped on both ends, with a fuse or timer on one end. 
</P>
<P>
Once detonated, the powder burns slowly before exploding. The explosion sends 
hot shrapnel in all directions at three times the speed of a .38-caliber 
bullet. A vacuum is created, and windows blow outward; people are knocked to 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Pipe bombs have been placed near jars of gasoline to create a secondary 
explosion, Grayson said. Without that secondary explosion, however, pipe bombs 
are not particularly destructive as bombs go, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've talked to people who've just had their hands blown off by a pipe bomb but 
are still talking," Grayson said. "If dynamite or plastic explosive goes off 
near you, you just vaporize; the skin is ripped from your bones."

FUGITIVE INDIAN ACTIVIST WANTED ON 14 KIDNAPING CHARGES ARRESTED

<P>
Fugitive Indian activist Eddie Hatcher, wanted on 14 kidnaping charges in North 
Carolina, was arrested by the FBI on Friday after failing to persuade officials 
at the Soviet consulate to grant him political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher was inside the consulate for several hours, until he was escorted out 
the gate by Soviet officials and taken into custody by waiting FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
While in the consulate, he sent out a statement, handwritten on a sheet of 
yellow legal paper, claiming that officials in the federal government and in 
North Carolina were trying to destroy him. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher, 31, and Timothy Jacobs, 20, held about 20 people hostage in the 
offices of The Robesonian newspaper in North Carolina on Feb. 1, 1988. The two 
Tuscarora Indians said they took over the newspaper to draw attention to their 
claims of law enforcement involvement in drug trafficking and official 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-hour siege ended when Gov. Jim Martin agreed to form a state task force 
to investigate their charges. The task force, in its report, found no evidence 
to support the claims, and Martin later said they were based on "rumor and 
gossip." 
</P>
<P>
"The state of N.C. and the government of the United States has made every 
vindictive attempt to destroy my life, my family and my people. They will not 
cease until they have accomplished this," Hatcher's statement read. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no hope in the American government, nor do I see fairness." 
</P>
<P>
A federal jury last October acquitted both men on federal hostage-taking and 
firearms charges after a three-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
But the Robeson County grand jury in December indicted the two Indians on the 
kidnaping charges. Hatcher was arrested in Pembroke, N.C., but Jacobs fled the 
state and sought sanctuary at the Onondaga Indian Reservation near Syracuse, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fled to Reservation 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher fled to the same reservation after his $25,000 bond was posted by the 
National Council of Churches. He later left New York and sought refuge on the 
Ft. Hall Reservation in Idaho. He disappeared from that reservation several 
weeks ago after being taken under tribal custody. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs was arrested in New York after leaving the reservation, and a state 
judge is considering whether he should be extradited to North Carolina to face 
the kidnaping charges. 
</P>
<P>
Both men have claimed that their lives would be in jeopardy if they return to 
Robeson County. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in a telephone call from the consulate to the Associated Press bureau 
in Raleigh, N.C., Hatcher said: "The people in the United States are always 
crying about human rights violations in the Soviet Union. I want them to know 
about the human rights violations in this country against the Indians and the 
poor." 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher's attorney, New York civil rights lawyer William Kunstler, said before 
the Soviets yielded Hatcher to U.S. authorities: "If they will give him 
sanctuary there, it's a bit of foreign soil and therefore, no gendarmes from 
federal or state agencies can get in there." 
</P>
<P>
"American consulates are done this way frequently," he said. "If they can keep 
him there, it would save him from immediate arrest. What's worrying him is that 
he won't survive inside Robeson County. His bail restricts him to Robeson 
County and that makes him very vulnerable."

WOMAN WHO KILLED INFANT SON ALLOWED TO GET MENTAL HELP ON OUTPATIENT BASIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge Friday ignored a recommendation that Sheryl Lynn Massip 
be confined to a state mental hospital and ordered her to undergo at least a 
year of outpatient therapy to determine whether she has recovered from a 
psychosis that led her to kill her infant son two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald appeared to have based his unexpected ruling on an 
11th-hour disclosure that a Los Angeles County man in circumstances similar to 
Massip's had been allowed to undergo outpatient therapy at a clinic in 
Fullerton, contrary to what was described as established procedure in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Under those procedures, psychologists and an administrator for county mental 
health programs testified, they are required by law to confine and evaluate for 
at least six months anyone found guilty of certain violent crimes by reason of 
insanity. 
</P>
<P>
The only facility designated as appropriate for such confinement -- even if the 
person had shown significant progress toward recovery -- is Patton State 
Hospital in San Bernardino County, they said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exception to the Rule 
</P>
<P>
The psychologists, during a lunch break in the court proceeding, however, 
checked and disclosed that they had found an exception to that rule, which 
involved a man who had been found not guilty of assault by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
The man, they said, had been undergoing outpatient therapy in Los Angeles 
County and then was transferred in 1980 to an outpatient clinic in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can accept transfers from Los Angeles" into the outpatient program, "we 
can accept this woman," said Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision stunned the 24-year-old La Palma woman, who said later 
that she was prepared to be sent to a mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Massip said she intends to get a driver's license and look for a job as a 
beautician. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she planned to have more children, Massip responded, "Absolutely not. 
That's a very futuristic question at this point." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
National Attention 
</P>
<P>
Her case attracted national attention because of her contention that she was 
suffering from a severe case of post-partum depression -- or "baby blues" -- in 
April, 1987, when she ran over her 6-month-old son with the family car, then 
tried to cover up the killing. 
</P>
<P>
A jury last year found her guilty of second-degree murder. But Fitzgerald, in 
an extraordinary action in December, set aside that verdict and ruled that 
Massip indeed had been insane at the time of the killing, and therefore was not 
responsible for her actions. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas J. Borris, who prosecuted Massip, said after 
Fitzgerald's ruling that the judge's action on the jury verdict is in the 
process of being appealed. He does not know if Friday's ruling also will be 
appealed, he said.

OFFICIALS MOVE TO CURB RELEASE OF FREON GAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California could take the national lead in fighting the spread of 
ozone-depleting chemicals if proposals presented Friday by Los Angeles Mayor 
Tom Bradley and state Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) are adopted. 
</P>
<P>
At a City Hall news conference, Bradley called on the City Council to enact a 
measure requiring all service stations and auto repair shops in Los Angeles to 
use special equipment to recycle the chemical Freon when servicing automobile 
air-conditioning units. 
</P>
<P>
He was joined by Hayden, who unveiled proposed legislation, including a bill 
that would extend the repair shop requirements to auto service centers 
throughout California. Hayden's proposals, to be introduced over a two-year 
period, go on to call for an eventual ban on use of all forms of so-called CFC 
chemicals in California by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
No jurisdiction in the nation as yet has such strict controls in place. 
</P>
<P>
The control of Freon from auto air-conditioning units alone could eliminate 
nearly 20% of all the CFC chemicals used nationally, according to statistics 
presented by Bradley's office. When the Freon in a vehicle's air conditioner 
becomes contaminated with water or air, service stations routinely drain the 
gas -- simply allowing it to escape into the atmosphere -- and replace it with 
pure Freon. 
</P>
<P>
The CFC chemicals are widely used in refrigeration, air conditioning, aerosol 
sprays and the manufacture of polystyrene. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hole in the Ozone 
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that CFCs are destroying the Earth's ozone layer, which 
protects plant and animal life from ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Experts 
believe that CFCs have already created a hole in the ozone layer over 
Antarctica, and leaders from around the world met in London this week to form a 
global plan for eventual elimination of the chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
"We prefer the comfort of cool air while we travel from one destination to 
another," Bradley said. "The problem is that Freon, a gas which creates this 
cool air, is the highest ozone-depleting gas." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said he will direct the city's General Services Department to buy the 
recycling units and begin using them on the city's fleet of about 6,000 
vehicles before the ordinance takes effect. The machines, made by about a dozen 
companies, cost from about $1,500 to $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's proposed ordinance would also ban the sale of Freon to anyone who 
cannot show proof of ownership of a recycling unit. The gas is now available in 
cans for people who want to replace the coolant in their automotive units 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The requirement for all service stations to use the machinery would begin on 
Jan. 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Requirement 
</P>
<P>
Some service station owners said the requirement would be just one more in a 
series of recently enacted environmental laws that cause them to buy special 
equipment or make other changes in the way they do business. 
</P>
<P>
But some representatives of the industry are supporting the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Shelton, director of the Southern California Service Station Assn., said, 
"They've made their case . . . and I think it makes a lot of sense." 
</P>
<P>
But, Shelton cautioned, much of the Freon in use in vehicles is lost to the 
atmosphere through broken seals or pipes long before motorists get to a service 
station. 
</P>
<P>
And the added costs, as always, would have to be passed along to consumers. 
Shelton said a typical $50 air-conditioning servicing would increase by $5 to 
$10.

NAACP DISMISSES ELECTION CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People has dismissed a 
challenge to the election of officers for the organization's Beverly 
Hills-Hollywood branch, national NAACP officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
About 25 branch members had charged that candidates allied with branch 
President Willis Edwards tampered with a voter eligibility list before the Feb. 
25 election. 
</P>
<P>
William Penn of the NAACP's national office dismissed the charges and ruled the 
election valid at the branch, which was created to combat discrimination in the 
entertainment industry. Penn was not available Thursday for comment on his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, I was vindicated," said Edwards, who was reelected to 
his post.

DEVELOPER FINED FOR BUILDING VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Developer Abby Sher has pleaded no contest to one count of violating Santa 
Monica building codes and paid a $562 fine. Another 14 counts against her were 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Sher's legal troubles stemmed from her controversial Edgemar complex on Santa 
Monica's Main Street, built to house shops, a restaurant and the private Santa 
Monica Museum of Art. City prosecutors accused Sher of allowing the complex to 
be used for art shows and other events before obtaining proper permits. 
</P>
<P>
In her plea, filed this week in Municipal Court, Sher did not contest one count 
that she improperly allowed a UCLA program to use the building last June. Sher 
also agreed to provide all lessees in the complex with written copies of the 
city's noise ordinance.

10 ARRESTED IN BIG SEIZURE OF COCAINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police have seized nearly 598 pounds of cocaine hidden in a trailer load of 
furniture outside a Victorville motel and arrested 10 men and women on 
suspicion of trafficking in the drug, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure early Thursday morning concluded an investigation that began two 
months ago in Torrance and led police to Lawndale, Chino, the San Fernando 
Valley and Diamond Bar, Torrance Police Sgt. Ron Traber said. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 suspects were being held on $5-million bail each at the Torrance Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance detectives were watching Wednesday night when Carlos Mejia, 25, and 
Pamela Garcia, 27, both of New York City, left a Diamond Bar home in a car 
towing a moving trailer, Traber said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they arrested the couple at 3 a.m. at a motel in the San Bernardino 
County community, where they had stopped for the night. Detectives said that 
they found the drugs in a secret compartment inside the trailer and that the 
shipment was destined for an East Coast distributor. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, police raided three homes -- in Diamond Bar, Sherman Oaks and 
Cerritos -- and arrested five men and three women for alleged trafficking in 
cocaine. More than $150,000 in cash was seized, along with another 22 pounds of 
cocaine, Traber said.

PUBLIC MEETINGS SET ON METRO RAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rapid Transit District has scheduled two public meetings to discuss benefit 
assessment districts for the second phase of the Metro Rail project. The route 
of Phase 2 goes as far west as Wilshire Boulevard and Western Avenue in the 
Mid-Wilshire district, and as far north as North Hollywood. Input from the 
meetings will be given to a task force that will advise policy makers on 
benefit assessment districts for Phase 2. Assessments from the private sector 
are expected to generate about $75 million, or 5% of the total funds, toward 
the cost of building Phase 2. 
</P>
<P>
The first meeting is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. March 16 in the main meeting room 
at the Hollywood Senior Multipurpose Center, 6501 Fountain Ave. The second is 
at 1 p.m. March 21 at the Los Angeles City College Student Center, 855 N. 
Vermont Ave.

GATES PRESSED ON HANDLING OF ANTI-ABORTION PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two members of the City Council charged on Friday that the Los Angeles Police 
Department is still too vague about its plans for handling massive 
demonstrations scheduled for later this month at area family planning clinics 
and they demanded a clearer statement from Chief Daryl F. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Zev Yaroslavsky and Michael Woo said they are concerned about police 
protection for area clinics that are being targeted by Operation Rescue, an 
anti-abortion group that stages sit-ins to disrupt business at family planning 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Although thousands of Operation Rescue activists have been arrested nationwide, 
none of an estimated 500 that shut down two Los Angeles-area clinics in 
February was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clear Up Confusion 
</P>
<P>
The two councilmen demanded and received a face-to-face meeting with Gates on 
Friday to clear up their confusion over the LAPD's policy. Earlier in the week, 
the full council grilled Los Angeles police officials over their low-key 
handling of February disturbances and several demanded that the department 
toughen up its enforcement of Operation Rescue sit-ins. 
</P>
<P>
But while the two came away from their meeting with the chief satisfied that he 
would aggressively enforce trespassing and unlawful disturbance laws, they said 
they were later surprised by a written statement from Gates that they said 
lacked the same force and clarity of his verbal assurances. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I heard in our meeting that . . . when push comes to shove -- 
literally -- that the Police Department would step in and clear the path," Woo 
said in an interview Friday. "I don't see that clearly stated" in Gates' 
prepared written statement to the press that followed the private meeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different 'Tone and Substance' 
</P>
<P>
"He was very clear in the meeting," Yaroslavsky said. "The tone and substance 
of this is different than what was said in the meeting. This statement does not 
reflect the clarity of the statement he made to us." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said: "The statement he issued reflects part of what the chief said 
in the meeting . . . (but) what it does not reflect is that if people are 
blocking doorways they will be arrested." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Right to Express' 
</P>
<P>
In his brief statement Gates said, in part, "In America, people have a First 
Amendment right to express themselves by engaging in public demonstrations. The 
Los Angeles Police Department not only recognizes that right, but will actively 
protect people while they exercise it." 
</P>
<P>
The statement continues, "The right to demonstrate, however, does not mean that 
the rights of others may be abused." Gates went on to say that lawbreakers will 
be "subjecting themselves to immediate arrest by the LAPD." The councilmen 
objected to the world "subjecting," charging that it was not strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
Among the areas of concern raised by Woo was the role of Deputy Chief Robert L. 
Vernon, an outspoken opponent of abortion. As director of the LAPD's office of 
operations, Vernon is the official in charge of dealing with the protests. 
</P>
<P>
"I raised the issue during the meeting . . . because of these questions on 
Chief Vernon's personal views," Woo said. "I thought it was important for the 
department to make it clear it would protect the legal rights of women seeking 
to use clinic services." 
</P>
<P>
Woo said that Gates responded by saying that the question of Vernon's beliefs 
"would come up inevitably, but that they want people to know it isn't going to 
make any difference in how the department enforces the law." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Vernon nor Gates could be reached. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Qualified Police Executive' 
</P>
<P>
However, LAPD spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said that strong religious views 
"do not disqualify you as a qualified police executive." Booth added: "Bob 
wouldn't be where he is, doing what he does, if he didn't conduct himself in 
accord with" city and department policy. 
</P>
<P>
Booth added that the chief's statement was an attempt to discuss the difficult 
issue of the demonstrations "in civilized language, not tyrannical language. It 
seems clear to me . . . if LAPD can arrest you -- if you break the law -- we 
will." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Woo said there remains "some confusion and concern on what will happen . 
. . and we will be working with police so that we are all prepared and are all 
ready on March 22," when the next round of demonstrations are expected. 
</P>
<P>
"Zev and I would like more said between now and March 22 to assure the public 
on how the department will react," Woo added. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said: "I think we need a clarification. . . . I think it's 
something we'll have to monitor and talk to the chief about again."

TRUCKER RECEIVES 4-YEAR TERM FOR FREEWAY RAMPAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charley Tom Lee Jr. was a man who always kept a tight lid on his emotions, his 
family members told the judge. In all of 25 years, he never raised his voice in 
anger. Not even once, they said. 
</P>
<P>
That is, until May 18, when 21 Los Angeles motorists discovered just how 
violent the truck driver from Texas could be when he finally blew his top. 
</P>
<P>
For that outburst, a contrite Lee was sentenced to four years in state prison 
Friday by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Judith Chirlin despite impassioned 
pleas for probation by Lee's wife, mother, grandmother and defense lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
On that May afternoon, Lee began rear-ending cars with his 18-wheel semi at 
speeds up to 80 m.p.h., starting on the San Bernardino Freeway in Temple City, 
and continuing on until California Highway Patrol officers finally pulled him 
over at gunpoint on the Hollywood Freeway in Los Angeles, leaving a 35-mile 
trail of leaking fuel, broken glass and twisted scraps of metal. 
</P>
<P>
His family said he had been under tremendous pressure on the day of the 
incident. He was distraught over his mother's chronic illness. He was beside 
himself over his father's attempted suicide. He was upset because he could not 
provide a better life for his bride and infant daughter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Truck Broke Down 
</P>
<P>
In addition, on the day of the rampage, Lee's truck had broken down, he had 
lost the keys to the tractor-trailer, and he had had an unpleasant encounter 
with a waitress somewhere along the way, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee did not speak in court Friday. But in a letter to Chirlin, he apologized to 
his victims and said he still has no explanation for his "erratic behavior" 
that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Lee in November pleaded guilty to five counts of assault with a deadly weapon 
in exchange for the dismissal of 11 other felony counts, including possession 
of a loaded handgun and a small amount of amphetamines. 
</P>
<P>
He faced up to eight years in prison, although a county probation report 
recommended supervised probation. 
</P>
<P>
According to Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig Veals, Lee could be released 
in about a year, considering the time Lee has already served in County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
In sentencing Lee, Chirlin said she could not ignore the nature of his crime. 
She said she has received numerous calls "from a variety of people" with 
strongly held opinions that were "split down the middle." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Living Out Fantasies' 
</P>
<P>
Some told the judge that Lee was "living out their fantasies" while others said 
what Lee had done was "every driver's nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Lee's family members testified -- often tearfully -- that they had "never" seen 
him angry. Always, said his mother, Billie Lee, he would "walk away" from 
unpleasant situations. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, when she told him that his father had attempted suicide, she 
said, Lee just ran and ran until he finally dropped in exhaustion. "He blamed 
himself," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After the freeway rampage, Lee told her "it was like a bad dream," Billie Lee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I never saw him angry," added Lee's grandmother, Dorothy Lee. She said he 
always had a sweet disposition -- from infancy, when she used to keep him in a 
potato bin in her grocery store in Missouri. She called him "Tater." 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Lee, his wife, said she had accompanied her husband on many cross-country 
trips and never once saw him "get violent" on the road. He was "a very 
courteous" driver, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerns Over Money 
</P>
<P>
On the road, they almost always slept in the truck to save money, she said, 
adding that he had become increasingly upset at not being able to provide a 
better life for his family. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't think he was doing enough for me and Chastity (their now 
19-month-old daughter)," she said. "It really upset him." 
</P>
<P>
Laura Green, the Los Angeles deputy public defender who represented Lee, asked 
Chirlin to grant Lee probation, noting that her client has relatives in 
California, in Nevada and in Missouri who are willing to look after him. 
</P>
<P>
But Chirlin, noting that this was "an extremely difficult case," said she could 
not overlook his crimes. And Veals said it was "sheer happenstance" that no one 
had been seriously injured in the rampage.

SO. BAPTIST GROUP TO START SEMINARY AS A RESPONSE TO FUNDAMENTALISTS

<TEXT>
<P>
The Southern Baptist Alliance has decided to start a seminary in Richmond, Va., 
in response to the fundamentalism now dominating the Southern Baptist 
Convention. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance, which is a faction of about 43,000 people within the 
14.7-million-member denomination, approved the move 462 to 42 at its third 
national convocation, held at First Baptist Church here. 
</P>
<P>
Backers said the seminary will champion women in ministry and will cooperate 
with other Baptist denominations. 
</P>
<P>
The new seminary was seen as a partial answer to actions of the new 
fundamentalist majority on the board of Southeastern Baptist Theological 
Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C. The former president of Southeastern, the Rev. 
Randall Lolley, told the alliance meeting that he was "a lucky Baptist to be at 
a time and a place where some free church Baptists said no to fundamentalism." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offers Prediction 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Barnes, professor of theology at Southeastern, predicted that she 
will be the last woman faculty member there "for a long, long time to come." 
She urged a positive vote for a new seminary because "there is no Baptist 
seminary in existence which has the vision of the Southern Baptist Alliance." 
</P>
<P>
Voting against the new seminary was the Rev. Harold Cole, executive 
secretary-treasurer emeritus of the South Carolina Baptist Convention. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the Southern Baptist Alliance to stay in the convention and to remain 
loyal to the convention," Cole said. He said he wants the alliance to remain as 
"a protest movement, but one within the denomination." 
</P>
<P>
The alliance seminary will cooperate with a black Baptist seminary already in 
Richmond and with seminaries of the American Baptist Churches. It will open 
when plans are implemented and about $500,000 is raised. An interim board of 
trustees is being established, and the school will open with about 150 
students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Drop 'Southern' 
</P>
<P>
Members also voted for the Southern Baptist Alliance to study the idea of 
dropping the word "Southern" from the name to reflect the fact that it has 
members in 40 states. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance heard a greeting from John Sundquist, who chairs the American 
Baptist Task Force on the Southern Baptist Convention. American Baptists want 
"to appropriately stand with our moderate brothers and sisters, whom we feel so 
close to," he said. "We feel your pain. Our prayers are with you. We wish you 
God's very best." 
</P>
<P>
The alliance also voted to have its directors study whether the group might 
become a representative body rather than a participatory democracy. The 
directors had proposed a general assembly or house of delegates from each state 
or region to attend the national business session, but the proposal did not go 
over well. Baptists hold annual state and national conventions in which 
"messengers" sent by churches are free to vote their consciences. 
</P>
<P>
Another issue that surfaced at the three-day convention was whether the 
Southern Baptist Woman's Missionary Union should publicly favor the ordination 
of women. The group, reportedly the largest women's organization in the world, 
promotes foreign missions. It has shied away from endorsing women as pastors or 
preachers, but it has affirmed the right of each local church to choose its own 
pastor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delegate Walks Out 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Ginny Britt, with Crisis Control Ministry in Winston-Salem, N.C., 
walked out in protest when Woman's Missionary Union leader Catherine Allen 
spoke. Later, Britt spoke to the group and urged that the union "make an 
affirming comment on the role of women as pastors in the local churches and as 
local preachers." 
</P>
<P>
Allen defended the union, saying that it has "very effectively cut a pathway 
for women" for 100 years.

UTILITIES' PROPHECY OF LOWER BILLS DRAWS FIRE 
</P>

<P>
The average San Diego County residential utility bill will be $50 to $60 less 
each year if Southern California Edison's proposed merger with San Diego Gas 
&amp; Electric Co. is approved, utility officials said Friday at a special 
legislative hearing on the merger. 
</P>
<P>
But San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor and a representative of utility consumers 
said they believe the takeover would increase gas and electric rates or, at 
best, leave them unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Peevey, an Edison vice president, said the takeover, which would create 
the largest investor-owned power company in the United States, would save 
ratepayers about $1.7 billion during the next decade. He said the savings would 
come through the elimination of administrative duplication and the more 
efficient use of the two utilities' power plants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lower Cost Claim 
</P>
<P>
"The combined companies will have lower costs and therefore lower rates than 
Southern California Edison or SDG&amp;E could achieve separately," Peevey said. 
Although SDG&amp;E's rates have been falling of late while Edison's have been 
rising, the San Diego company, if left on its own, eventually would be forced 
to build expensive new power plants to satisfy the energy demand of the 
county's rapidly growing population, said Peevey and Ron Fuller, an SDG&amp;E 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the Edison offer is a very good one for our customers," Fuller 
said. "The Edison offer provides us what we need to provide lower rates in the 
1990s. We have to do something." 
</P>
<P>
But O'Connor, who has helped lead the opposition to the Edison takeover, said 
she does not believe that Rosemead-based SCEcorp, Edison's parent company, 
would fulfill its promise. Describing the proposed Edison-SDG&amp;E 
conglomerate as a "monster utility," O'Connor said that Edison has given 
assurances to its shareholders that would conflict with the interests of 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Validity Questioned 
</P>
<P>
"The profit must come from somewhere," she said. "I fear it will come from 
increased rates from San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network, a 
San Diego consumer group, also questioned the validity of the Edison claim. 
</P>
<P>
"I just see that as further evidence of Edison's rich fantasy life," Shames 
said. He said SDG&amp;E's costs without the merger need not increase as much as 
Edison contends they will. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a car salesman saying this car is priced at $15,000 but he can give 
it to you for $12,000," Shames said. "But the car doesn't really sell for 
$15,000 in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
Shames also complained that Peevey overestimated the potential savings for San 
Diegans because most of SDG&amp;E's residential customers use far more 
electricity than the utility's "average" customer does. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Questions 
</P>
<P>
Another consumer group leader questioned Edison's pledge to reduce rates in San 
Diego, potentially at the expense of Edison customers. "You can't reduce one 
group of customers' rates and not the other group's," said Sylvia Siegel, 
executive director of San Francisco-based Toward Utility Rate Normalization. 
"You can't do that because (the merger would create) one company." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), chairwoman of the Assembly Utilities 
and Commerce Committee, and Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), chairman 
of the Senate Energy and Public Utilities Committees, held Friday's special 
joint hearing to investigate the merger even though, under current law, the 
Legislature has no direct voice in the matter, which will eventually be decided 
by the Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Already this year, more than half a dozen bills have been introduced that could 
affect the merger. Several concern a proposal to thwart the merger by allowing 
the San Diego County Water Authority to take over SDG&amp;E and run it as a 
municipal utility. Other bills would set guidelines for the PUC to use when it 
decides whether to approve the merger. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$3-Million Increase 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal announced Friday that he will seek a $3-million increase in the PUC's 
budget this year to pay for more representation for consumers at the 
commission's hearings on the merger. He said Southern California Edison has 
vowed to spend $15 million or more to get the commission's approval. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the extra money proposed by Rosenthal would be used by the PUC to hire 
consultants and part would be allocated to public groups to help them prepare 
the cases they intend to present to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
"This will not make the playing field level, but it will no longer be 
lopsided," said Rosenthal, who will pursue the funding during a Monday Senate 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
However, Shames complained that the funds would not help consumer groups unless 
they are handed out almost immediately. "I'm preparing my budget right now," 
Shames said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal also said he and Sen. Wadie Deddeh (D-Bonita) have proposed that the 
commission open a temporary office in San Diego because several hearings on the 
issue will be held there this year. 
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said Friday that the utilities are now scheduled to 
present documents supporting their case April 17, a month later than had been 
planned. They said the change will probably mean that the PUC will not reach a 
decision until early 1990.

MEMBERS OF HOMEOWNER GROUP CALL IT A 'LAND GRAB'; 
</P>
<P>
DEAL WITH SCHOOLS TRIGGERS RENEWED RANCOR IN RAMONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Country Estates residents choose to live in their exclusive community 
near Ramona because of the wide-open spaces in the backcountry and the 
availability of starting times on the resort's golf course. 
</P>
<P>
So, when some of the homeowners found out that their community association had 
"given away" some of their open space to the local Ramona school district, 
tempers flared. 
</P>
<P>
The Ramona Unified School District, which serves Country Estates, now has one 
elementary school with more than 1,000 students in buildings designed for 700. 
The school district and homeowner association settled a 12-year-long "friendly" 
court battle that awarded the schools title to two other school sites. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dispute Heats Up 
</P>
<P>
But the rancor failed to end with the settlement last fall. In fact, it heated 
up when Country Estates residents found out that the school district planned to 
build a much-needed school on a site that required 2 acres or more of adjoining 
open space belonging to the property owners' association. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on March 1, when a deed was filed showing that two SDCE Homeowners Assn. 
officers had approved turning over the tract of open space -- more than 9 acres 
-- to the school district, some of the homeowners revolted and demanded that 
the "land grab" be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Endeman, associate superintendent of the Ramona school district, verbally 
shrugged off the demands of Country Estates residents as "overreaction" to a 
situation that could be settled amicably. 
</P>
<P>
"We had hoped we could do this by working together," Endeman said, "but I guess 
not." 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting earlier this week, the homeowner group voted to file suit against 
the school district to rescind the agreement that gives the schools the right 
to develop the homeowners' acreage. James Danow, attorney for the homeowners' 
group, was instructed to sue the school district immediately to regain the 
community's open space. 
</P>
<P>
Danow said that the lawsuit has been filed. 
</P>
<P>
Endeman explained that one school site is on an 11.3-acre Country Estates tract 
split by a stream bed, requiring the district to acquire "about an acre and a 
half" of the homeowners' adjacent open space to create a state-approved site 
without cutting down a stand of venerable oaks or disturbing the creek bed. 
</P>
<P>
A few residents are offended at the expansion, she said, because "they don't 
want an elementary school located on their street or kids playing ball near 
their houses." 
</P>
<P>
But Bill Benson, a spokesman for the dissident group, which calls itself SOS -- 
both for Save Our School and for Save Open Space -- feels that the matter goes 
deeper than that. It violates the homeowner association's restrictive covenants 
that require approval of 75% of the Country Estates' property owners before any 
of the community-owned common space is sold or given away. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is opposed to an additional school. In fact we are all for it," Benson 
said, "but not at the expense of our open space." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crux of Issue 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the signing of the deed that turns over the homeowners' land to the 
school district. Godfrey Tudor-Matthews, president of the homeowner 
association, and board member Charles Lemenager signed the stipulated agreement 
for the land transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Lemenager, a former employee of Country Estates' developer Ray Watt, could not 
be reached for comment and reportedly is out of the country. Tudor-Matthews 
conceded that he had failed to read the document thoroughly and thought that it 
simply confirmed what the friendly lawsuit had determined -- that the school 
district should gain title to about 2 acres of the homeowners' property to 
create a school site without a vote of the property owners. 
</P>
<P>
The finger-pointing began in earnest when residents learned that the school 
district had recorded a deed that gave them, not only the school site and the 2 
acres or so of common land needed to flesh out their property to state 
standards, but the rest of the homeowner association's open space flanking the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Tudor-Matthews sighs when he concedes that he signed the deed transferring 
homeowners' association land to the Ramona school district. 
</P>
<P>
He said he thought it was a shortcut to achieving what more than 15 years of 
discussion and friendly lawsuits had sought: creation of a proper elementary 
school site for Country Estates. When he read the document more closely, he 
realized that he had given away the entire open-space area -- about 9 acres of 
homeowner group's property around the school site. 
</P>
<P>
But Tudor-Matthews pointed the finger of guilt at the school board, which, 
after agreeing not to file the faulty deed, went ahead and did so. He may not 
have been too smart in signing the agreement without reading it closely, he 
said, but the school board members are the ones who violated the residents' 
faith by breaking their promises not to file the deed until it could be 
amended. 
</P>
<P>
Tudor-Matthews, looking back at the convoluted and emotional issue, thinks he 
would have acted differently. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, if we had it to do over again, we would have put it to a vote (of the 
Country Estates property owners)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the school district has snatched the land, Tudor-Matthews doubts that 
a vote would be worthwhile. "I don't think that they trust the school district 
now," he said of Country Estate property owners. "I'm just hoping that our 
attorney develops a strong enough case to get our land back." 
</P>
<P>
Arvie Degenfelder, president of the Ramona Unified School Board, agrees with 
Tudor-Matthews that a vote of SDCE property owners would be fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
"Nowhere in the world" would the measure pass by a 75% majority required under 
the Country Estates' laws, Degenfelder said. 
</P>
<P>
Degenfelder has yet to be served in the latest lawsuit about the disputed 
property and admits that she does not look forward to further delays in 
building the 700-pupil elementary school in the planned community. 
</P>
<P>
The school, which would be completed by 1991 at the earliest, is needed now, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so absurd," she said. "The homeowners and the school district want the 
same thing. I am sure it will all be worked out eventually. But when, I don't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
People who buy land in a planned community expect that such land disputes will 
be worked out by the developers, Degenfelder explained in pointing the finger 
of blame at Ray Watt, the developer. But, when Watt finished his part and 
turned over the assets to the homeowners' association, "they also inherited the 
liabilities, too," including the school site controversy. 
</P>
<P>
After the school district has state approval to build its school on the 
slightly expanded site, it will turn the rest of the open space back to the 
Country Estates property owners, she said.

BIP ROBERTS HOPES PADRES CAN SEE HOW HE HAS GROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Sometimes that's what it takes, what Bip Roberts did that summer night in 1987. 
Sometimes, maybe, it takes stripping off both clothes and pride for a man to 
take a good look at himself. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the middle just another triple-A game, in just another triple-A city, 
just another Bip Roberts grounder. 
</P>
<P>
"Except I didn't run this grounder out," Roberts remembers. "I kind of, well, I 
walked to first base." 
</P>
<P>
He was immediately scolded and fined by Las Vegas Manager Jack Krol. And that 
was it. Roberts walked off the field, through the dugout and up into the 
clubhouse. He took off all his clothes. He was going home. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't take it anymore, I was done," recalls Roberts, who just one year 
earlier had been the Padres' starting second baseman. "I couldn't handle this 
game, I couldn't handle the failure. I had fallen a long way and reached the 
bottom and couldn't see a way out. I was finished." 
</P>
<P>
Into the clubhouse rushed Rob Piccolo, Padre minor league coach. He approached 
this crazy-looking infielder in his underwear and read him the last rites. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me if I couldn't handle this, couldn't handle adversity, then I could 
never handle anything," Roberts said. "He told that if I left now I would be 
letting a lot of people down . . . but mostly myself. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought about it and realized he's right. I can't quit." 
</P>
<P>
He was dressed and back on the field in time for the next inning. Now, two 
years later, back with a suddenly good chance to make the Padres, he won't 
quit. 
</P>
<P>
His role? He would be a utility infielder/outfielder, one who comes on in the 
late innings to either preserve a victory or make one. 
</P>
<P>
The reason he'd be good for the role? "I can play in crunch time," Roberts 
said, "because the last couple of years of my life have been crunch time." 
</P>
<P>
Flash back to 1986. With the departure of second baseman Alan Wiggins, the 
Padres claim there is a breeze through the middle of the infield. They are 
hoping to fill it with a kid from double-A named Leon Roberts, nicknamed "Bip" 
by his uncle, who was watching cartoons at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that's what I am, " Roberts says today. "A cartoon character." 
</P>
<P>
That's certainly what he was. Even before he put on a Padre uniform, he was 
telling people he would make them forget all about Wiggins. He was talking 
about stealing more bases, getting more hits. He was 22 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"He was talking about this in the newspaper, even before spring training," Tony 
Gwynn said. "I remember reading it and thinking he better do all that. If he 
doesn't do all that, he's getting ridiculed."' 
</P>
<P>
Guess what. He didn't do all that. Didn't steal the bases, didn't get the hits, 
didn't do anything but talk about it. In the end, he didn't do anything but 
make everybody mad. 
</P>
<P>
"He came in here and 'big-leagued' it," Gwynn said, using a players' term for 
players who act cocky with no reason. "People tagged him as our savior, and 
that's kind of how he acted." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn said that while Roberts initially struggled at the plate and in the 
field, he never came to Gwynn, or anyone, for help. 
</P>
<P>
"So finally I came to him and told him, 'If you work as hard on the field as 
you do off the field, you'd be a great player,' " Gwynn explained. "He looked 
at me and said, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.' It was the kind of answer where, you knew 
he didn't think I knew what I was talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts eventually lost his starting job to Tim Flannery, with whom he was 
platooned. He finished the year hitting a respectable .253 in 241 at-bats. But 
the Padres decided they had seen enough of his act. Roberts went home in the 
fall of 1986 and was not heard from by the big league team again -- not during 
the spring, not anytime -- until the fall of 1988, when he was recalled after 
hitting .353 in a full season in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his demotion, he couldn't tell you what he did wrong. But the 
past two years have taught him. Have they ever. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're at the bottom looking up, you realize things," Roberts said. "I 
had taken everything for granted. I was ready for the big leagues physically 
but not mentally. I had never been anything but No. 1 in my life, and all of a 
sudden pitchers were getting me out, and catchers were throwing me out." 
</P>
<P>
Also, for the first time, Roberts said he felt alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the veterans on this team didn't want me to be here, and it was 
obvious," Roberts said. "I got more and more down. It was like, I'd get out to 
the plate, and already I was down two strikes. It was hard." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gwynn: "The reason some veterans didn't want him to be here was that he 
would just not act like a rookie." 
</P>
<P>
So Padre management made him back up. The first step was the spring of 1987, 
when he quickly cut from the big league camp and ordered to triple-A in favor 
of Joey Cora. Once in Las Vegas, he became so despondent that he became a 
different player, a period culminating in his near-quitting experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say he was depressed," said Mark Parent, the Las Vegas catcher in 
1987. "He would walk around looking down and just not getting the job done." 
</P>
<P>
It was to get worse before it got better. Although he wound up hitting .306 in 
Las Vegas in 1987, he was not even put on the major league roster, and last 
spring he was not even invited to big league camp. 
</P>
<P>
This meant he reported to Yuma with the minor leaguers. And dressed in crowded, 
cluttered quarters with the minor leaguers. And spent a month at the Motel 6. 
And ate on $3 a day. 
</P>
<P>
"Living in a dump, barely having enough money to eat, I hated it, I hated it," 
Roberts said. "It set off something inside of me. It got me thinking, I've got 
to show everybody how to play this game." 
</P>
<P>
So he hit .354 at Las Vegas, somewhat amazing even in the rarefied air of the 
Pacific Coast League. And then he was called up to San Diego after he had 
helped the Stars to a league title. In his only start with the Padres, he had 
three hits. 
</P>
<P>
And this spring, he returned to big-league camp, back to the Days Inn Suites 
and all the food that can be purchased for $50 a day. He wasn't coming in as 
the starting second baseman -- Roberto Alomar moved in during his absence -- 
but he's not just a second baseman anymore. He has learned to play third base, 
and shortstop, and left and center fields. 
</P>
<P>
"That's another thing I learned," he said. "The more you do, the harder it is 
for them to get rid of you." 
</P>
<P>
And thus he may stay. He had five hits in two games on the second day of camp 
and has not stopped hustling. Manager Jack McKeon has used him in more spring 
games than anyone -- all eight thus far -- and even though he is hitting just 
.133, a manager sometimes looks for other things. Such as head-first slides 
into first base. 
</P>
<P>
"Biff has showed me a lot," McKeon said. "By playing a lot of positions, Biff 
can give me more options late in a game. Biff's looked good out there." 
</P>
<P>
Looked mature, too. So mature, it doesn't even bother him that McKeon 
consistently and inexplicably refers to him as "Biff." 
</P>
<P>
"Long as he gives me a job," Roberts said, "the man can call me Pee-wee 
Herman." 
</P>

The Padre defense was awful again Friday in an 8-5 loss to Oakland in Phoenix, 
which dropped the Padres' spring record to 4-3-1. A sign of a championship team 
is consistency, but the Padres don't need this kind of consistency. Shortstop 
Mike Brumley let another ground ball skip past him -- he's playing himself off 
the team at this point -- while left fielder Gerald Clark didn't help himself 
by not chasing down what could have been an easy fly out. "I don't like our 
defense," Manager Jack McKeon said in one of the few negatives to escape his 
mouth this spring. " All of this is going into our computer." What computer? 
"The one I have in my hotel room," McKeon said. "My computer smokes a cigar." 
</P>
<P>
For the Padre offense, the bright spot was a base hit by Brumley's competitor 
for the backup shortstop job, Gary Green. It was Green's first hit of the 
spring in nine at-bats. Still hitless are Sandy Alomar Jr. (11 at-bats) and 
Garry Templeton (12). . . . There were no bright spots for the pitchers. 
Starter Walt Terrell was racked for five runs on 10 hits in just four innings. 
Greg Booker was hit for two runs in two innings and Eric Nolte for one run in 
two innings. . . . Jack Clark played right field for the first time this spring 
after John Kruk bruised his right foot Thursday and moved from right to 
designated hitter. Clark easily handled his only fly ball with a catch at the 
wall, not to mention going one for three with an RBI. Although Clark claimed he 
was a slow spring starter, he is five for 11 (.455) with two doubles. . . . 
Tony Gwynn had two more hits, bringing his spring average to .417, despite 
saying before the game that he has stopped taking extra batting practice, 
formerly a tradition with the three-time batting champion. "The older you get, 
you learn to make adjustments," said Gwynn, 28. "Physically, all that hitting 
is a grind. I hit off a tee now, and I think it will be just as good." 
Historians will recall that it was in this Phoenix ballpark used by the A's 
where last season Gwynn finally admitted his left index finger was too sore to 
continue. He flew home after the club's game with the A's and underwent surgery 
shortly thereafter. "Last year here, I came out to take batting practice, and I 
couldn't do anything," Gwynn recalled. "I flew back to San Diego . . . where 
hell began."

IT WASN'T AN EASY DECISION FOR HORNER 
</P>

<P>
Three days before, when rain had chased everybody else under cover, he was a 
solitary figure on a soaked practice field. 
</P>
<P>
The workout had been interrupted and the players who hadn't made the trip to 
West Palm Beach were in the dugout when there was a sudden burst of laughter. 
"Stay alive down there," Oriole pitcher Dave Schmidt shouted after the hitter 
dropped to the ground to avoid an errant baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"Get a good pitch," Schmidt yelled when the hitter again had to duck to avoid 
being hit. Six pitches went by before the hitter got to swing his bat. 
</P>
<P>
Even the elements were working against Bob Horner, who already had an inkling 
of the inevitable. The rain seemed to have ungreased the pitching machine, but 
as long as it was still flinging balls in his general direction, Horner was 
swinging. 
</P>
<P>
Not until the machine emptied itself did Horner pack his gear and trudge slowly 
toward the dugout. His antics in the batting cage had provided a brief, comical 
interlude to spring training, but the humor was lost on Horner, who was unaware 
of his captive audience. As he entered the dugout, Horner's face gave an 
indication of what was to come. 
</P>
<P>
Though nobody suspected, Horner was getting the message that his shoulder 
wouldn't survive spring training. He mulled his decision for two days before 
calling Orioles General Manager Roland Hemond. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, what the veteran slugger said was: "I can't do it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, without completely drawing up the bridge, Horner made it official. He 
called off his comeback attempt with the Orioles and headed for his home in 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
He probably felt out of place at a news conference hastily arranged by the 
Orioles. He had spent all but two years of his career with the Atlanta Braves, 
having played in Japan in 1987 and briefly with the St. Louis Cardinals last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles were the only team that invited him to camp so he could try to 
prove himself. Considering the club's need for a right-handed hitter, Horner 
might have been able to milk the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a credit to him and the kind of person he is that he decided to come to 
us now rather than later in the spring, or early in the season," Hemond said. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't be fair to the Orioles, or to (Manager) Frank Robinson for me to 
wait," Horner said. "They have a lot of hard decisions to make before they head 
north. And my shoulder is not near where it needs to be." 
</P>
<P>
Horner had been afforded the luxury of setting his own timetable before facing 
live pitching. Thursday he was scheduled to go to West Palm Beach and be in the 
lineup against his former team. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for him," said Braves outfielder Dale Murphy. "I was saying, 
'Where is he? Where is he?' I was going to get on him for not making the trip 
Monday, because I never make (spring training) road trips, either." 
</P>
<P>
When Murphy found out why Horner wasn't there, it hit him hard. "I was kind of 
shocked," he said. "Like everyone else, I didn't know what kind of shape his 
shoulder was in. I saw him rehabilitating it in St. Louis last year, and I 
figured everything would be OK." 
</P>
<P>
But the surgery last August was the third performed on Horner's left shoulder. 
You only get three strikes at the plate, and he figures there's no need to get 
any more in the operating room. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see what good another operation would do," Horner said. "I still have 
a family I want to raise, and I don't think it would be good for them to have a 
cripple for a father. It reached the point where I couldn't focus on making the 
club -- I was too worried about the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to slam the door completely," he said, "but right now I have no 
thoughts other than to go home to my family and let the shoulder heal -- if 
it's going to heal." 
</P>
<P>
Horner said he knew he wasn't 100% when he accepted the Orioles' invitation to 
spring training. "When I left Dallas I told everybody that I had no pain, but 
it (the shoulder) was still bothering me. I didn't know if it was just 
stiffness, because I hadn't played or what. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't just shut it down then, because then you question yourself the rest 
of your life. I had to come here and find out for sure. I really felt I could 
still play. The key was the shoulder - if it was OK, I'm OK. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank kept saying, 'You're rusty,' and you keep thinking that one more day . . 
. one more week . . . but finally you have to say you're just kidding yourself. 
Eventually, it would have caught up to me, and I didn't want to lead the 
Orioles on when I knew I couldn't do it. Stepping down is the toughest decision 
any player has to make. You can put it off, but eventually you wake up and 
realize enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
During Horner's injury-plagued 10-year career, perhaps nobody appreciated him 
more than Murphy, whose best years came while hitting in front of his longtime 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
"He was one of those hitters who was just unusual," Murphy said. "He would come 
to spring training and his swing would be there. He wouldn't need any time. He 
had the swing - short and quick, and he had a good eye. Had it not been for 
injuries he would really have put some big numbers on the board. As far as I'm 
concerned he'll always be one of the best power hitters. I feel bad for him." 
</P>
<P>
Horner, although acknowledging that injuries have made his career "weird," 
refused to feel sorry for himself. "All you can do is play the hand that's 
dealt you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Horner stepped off the campus of Arizona State, where he originally hurt his 
shoulder and underwent surgery for the first time, and into the Braves' lineup 
in 1978. He would never spend a day in the minor leagues. By the age of 29, and 
despite wrist and shoulder injuries that plagued him throughout his career, he 
had reached 200 homers. Neither Ted Williams nor Mike Schmidt had hit that many 
at the same age. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at the age of 31, his career has evidently come to an end -- in the 
batting cage along the right-field line in Miami's Bobby Maduro Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The pitching machine and his left shoulder came up empty at just about the same 
time.

NBA SCOUTS ARE LEARNING TO THINK SMALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY SULLIVAN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stu Inman admits it has taken a while, but National Basketball Assn. scouts and 
general managers have finally realized the wisdom of thinking small. 
</P>
<P>
"Our thought process has changed a bit," said Inman, the director of player 
personnel for the Miami Heat. "I remember how we used to look at guys like 
Michael Adams and Spud Webb, how we laughed at them and said they couldn't play 
at our level." 
</P>
<P>
Well, they're not laughing now. They're too busy scouring the nation for the 
next great little point guard and trying to make certain they don't repeat some 
of their recent, egregious mistakes. Michael Adams wasn't too slow after all. 
Mark Price wasn't too frail. Mark Jackson wasn't too slow. 
</P>
<P>
But scouts missed badly on all of them, and no one wants to miss again. That's 
why, when they come to Madison Square Garden this week for the Big East 
tournament, the scouts and general managers will keep an especially vigilant 
eye on five seniors who compose the best collection of NBA point guard 
prospects to come out of the conference in years. 
</P>
<P>
The five are Syracuse's Sherman Douglas, Boston College's Dana Barros, 
Georgetown's Charles Smith, Seton Hall's John Morton and Villanova's Kenny 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the small guards in college basketball today are going to make an 
immediate impression," said Marty Blake, the NBA's director of scouting, "but 
this is the best year in memory for the little guards." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're clearly going to see more guards taken in the first round this 
year than we've ever had," Inman said. "But it's the old question. Can he lead? 
Does he make the four players around him better?" 
</P>
<P>
That, more than size, is the issue now. Just because a player is 6-foot and 
talented doesn't mean he can run an NBA team. It doesn't mean he's a true point 
guard. Those are hard to find, and as George Irvine says, it's not getting any 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
"Point guards are sort of like centers now," said Irvine, the personnel 
director (and briefly this season, coach) of the Indiana Pacers. "It's hard to 
find the point guard mentality. I think as scouts we're tougher on point guard 
prospects than any other position. If he comes down and scores 24, we say he 
shoots too much. If he runs his team and doesn't score, we say he's not enough 
of a scorer." 
</P>
<P>
As a whole, the Big East guards fall in the former category. "Are they true 
point guards?" Blake said. "I don't know, it's hard to tell. Why? Because 
they're all shooting guards. They're playing the point, but they're shooting." 
</P>
<P>
One thing that became clear from talking with scouts and general managers is 
that the 6-foot Douglas, the NCAA's career assist leader, is the purest point 
guard of the lot and likely to be the Big East point guard selected highest in 
the draft. Still, most believe he won't go in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt that," New Jersey Nets General Manager Harry Weltman said. "There are 
too many other good players out there. . . . There are certain areas of his 
game people might question, like his free-throw shooting." 
</P>
<P>
Indiana, a likely lottery participant, is desperate for a point guard and might 
consider Douglas with a late lottery pick. But even they have doubts. "I've 
been very confused about him," Irvine said, "because 90% of the time he plays 
really well at the point, but all of a sudden he goes haywire." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine has a somewhat different view of the 6-foot, 150-pound Smith, the Big 
East's player of the year. "He hits the big shots at the end," Irvine said, 
"but I don't like the other 38 minutes. He's not a point guard. He wasn't one 
for the Olympic team and that's where they really struggled." 
</P>
<P>
The scouts seem genuinely intrigued by Barros, the 5-11 Boston College guard 
who led the conference in scoring the last two years. "He's a very good 
player," said Dick McGuire, the New York Knicks' scouting director. "He's a 
scorer in a point guard's body." 
</P>
<P>
Blake said he was convinced that Barros could handle the point and "ought to be 
able to play in this league." 
</P>
<P>
"I've talked to (Boston College Coach) Jimmy O'Brien about Barros," Irvine 
said, "and it'd be ludicrous for him not to be shooting. How else are they 
going to score? It's the same rap they put on Mark Price. Dana's really only 
5-9, but if a guy can play at that size, it doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
As for Villanova's 5-9 Wilson, who entered the season with a legitimate chance 
at being selected in the NBA's two-round draft, the scouts have basically 
decided he can't play at that level. "Kenny hasn't had that good a year," 
McGuire said. "I don't think he'll be drafted." 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall's 6-3 Morton was a prodigious high school scorer who never quite 
made the transition to the point. The Pirates, in fact, emerged after deciding 
he was better suited to the off guard. But to make the pros -- and scouts think 
he has a shot at being selected in the first round -- he'll have to play the 
point. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the tough questions," Inman said. "It's not what a player is, but 
what he can become, what you see in his emotional and physical makeup that will 
allow him to grow. The $64,000 question is, Which ones have the ceilings over 
their heads, and which have the most upside?" 
</P>
<P>
And, as the scouts have discovered, it's often a case of the smaller the 
player, the higher the ceiling.

BLAST FIVE FOR FIVE AGAINST SOCKERS;

<P>
CROW SCORES TYING GOAL LATE IN FOURTH, BUT BALTIMORE GETS WINNER 10 SECONDS 
LATER

<P>
On top of everything else Friday night at the Sports Arena, Ron Newman couldn't 
even get into the interview room. The door was locked. 
</P>
<P>
So the Socker coach had to wait a few extra seconds to talk about his team's 
continuing problems against the first-place Baltimore Blast (23-11), which 
defeated them, 3-2, in front of 10,648. 
</P>
<P>
The loss leaves the Sockers 5 1/2 games out of first place in the Major Indoor 
Soccer League. They are five for five this season. Five Baltimore victories. 
Five Socker losses. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the game, Newman had been thinking about ways the Sockers (18-17) might 
let this one slip away. 
</P>
<P>
"I was worried more about what was going to happen in overtime," he said, "and 
we don't even get there. It's horrible to lose like that." 
</P>
<P>
The reason? An unspectacular shot by Baltimore's Mark Mettrick, off a pass from 
Carl Valentine, that hit three defenders before bouncing into the left corner 
of the goal with 52 seconds remaining. Newman termed it a "bloody, squirrely 
goal." 
</P>
<P>
Ten seconds earlier, Kevin Crow gave the Sockers what they had been waiting for 
since the first quarter. A plain goal. 
</P>
<P>
His equalizer came off a pass from Branko Segota, but Crow credited forward 
Steve Zungul. 
</P>
<P>
"He was smart enough to let it go through his legs," Crow said. 
</P>
<P>
But before the Sockers could wipe the smiles off their faces, Mettrick was 
holding up his hands in triumph after his accomplishment at the other end of 
the carpet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous that they score the winning goal on that," Newman said. 
"They're a good side. We can't let them off." 
</P>
<P>
All evening, the Sockers pounded shots at Blast goalie Scott Manning. All 
evening, he deflected them. He was humble about it, crediting his defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to thank the goal posts," he said. "I think (shots) hit it about 
five times. 
</P>
<P>
Zoran Karic and Crow took one-two punches from both sides of the Blast goal in 
the fourth quarter, but Manning was ready and waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Then Zungul took his shots. Twice. On the first, Manning dived flat in the air 
to his right to tip the ball away. On the second, Manning slipped in the 
penalty box, but Zungul pushed the ball wide right. 
</P>
<P>
"He's scored more goals on me than I care to remember," Manning said. "After 
(the first save), I told Steve, 'We've been in the league a long time. At least 
let me make one save.' " 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Sockers, he made a few more than that. The offense was 
dry during the second and third quarters, aided by a Blast defense that ranks 
second to the Sockers in the MISL in goals allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Blast forward Domenic Mobilio put the finishing touches on a hard crossing pass 
from Kai Haaskivi to give Baltimore a 2-1 lead with 7:35 remaining in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Socker forward Paul Wright had stirred the crowd momentarily early in the third 
when he blazed down the left sideline on a breakaway. But his shot bounced just 
off the wall left of the Blast goal. 
</P>
<P>
After the Sockers took the early lead, Baltimore tied it, 1-1, when Haaskivi 
punched in a shot from a few feet in front of the goal with 3:23 remaining the 
second quarter. Socker goalie Victor Nogueira came out to his right to stop 
Haaskivi's approach, but the ball skipped by him. Socker defender Gus Mokalis 
stopped the ball before it crossed the goal-line but Haaskivi was there to 
follow the deflection. 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, Nogueira and Manning took turns knocking down close-range 
shots. Segota was foiled twice, once from about 20 yards out and again on a 
header in the middle of the penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Black had the only early success against Manning, who has been selected 
the defensive player of the game in each of the team's four previous meetings 
this season. Segota passed left on a restart kick from the top of the penalty 
arch, and Black slipped a shot into the left corner of the goal past a diving 
Manning to give the Sockers a 1-0 lead with just 21 seconds remaining in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Socker midfielder Brian Quinn (strained left arch) was held out of Friday's 
game but could be available for tonight's game with Wichita. Cacho, who has 
been recovering from a hamstring injury, was not scheduled to play but entered 
the game in the third period. . . . Tonight's game will make two weeks in a row 
the Sockers have back-to-back games scheduled. Last week, they dropped a pair 
on the road, losing to Kansas City and Baltimore. Entering Friday night's game, 
the Sockers had won just five of 18 back-to-back games. . . . The Sockers have 
only 17 roster members and need to pick up another player by March 16, 
according to MISL rules, or they will not be allowed to. . . . Socker 
midfielder Waad Hirmez had a goal added to his total when it was decided he 
should be credited with Alan Willey's goal in a Feb. 24 game against the Dallas 
Sidekicks.

<P>
With regard to Charlie Francis' March 1 mention of former and present abusers 
of steroids, I am absolutely certain that neither Evelyn Ashford nor her former 
coach, three-time Olympian Pat Connolly would ever use any 
performance-enhancing drug of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
I have known Evelyn since her last year in high school (1975) as a competitor, 
teammate and friend. I've traveled and trained with her and know her personal 
convictions on the use of such drugs, and she is vehemently against it. 
</P>
<P>
Her talent has never required artificial stimulation. She got her records the 
old-fashioned way. She earned them. 
</P>
<P>
As for Pat Connolly, my association with her began in '75 when she re-entered 
the women's track and field program she herself initiated in '73 at UCLA. She 
has been my mentor and friend ever since. She is a longtime opponent of drug 
use, and I and many other honest people are stunned and outraged by Francis' 
attempt to implicate Pat and Evelyn in his illegal and reprehensible coaching 
practices.

LET'S KEEP FIGHTING IN RING, NOT RINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Tracy Dodds' NHL notes (Feb. 23), Islander Coach Al Arbour apparently thinks 
hockey needs fights to prove something about standing up to another team. 
</P>
<P>
Arbour's words make me angry. 
</P>
<P>
If hockey's rules and suspension would be strictly enforced, it might become a 
much more widely accepted and respected sport. 
</P>
<P>
Hockey takes years of training, dedication and great athletic skill. I think 
fighting should be kept in the ring, not the rink.

NORTHRIDGE WOMEN ON THE BRINK OF A TITLE

<P>
Records were not the only things to fall on the third day of the NCAA Division 
II swimming and diving championships at State University of New York, Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
So did the hopes of all but two teams. 
</P>
<P>
Swimmers from teams other than Cal State Northridge and Cal State Bakersfield 
can concentrate on individual achievements today, the meet's last day. 
</P>
<P>
The team championships virtually have been decided. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge holds a commanding 280-217 lead over second-place North Dakota State 
in the women's standings, and some of the Lady Matadors' strongest events 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield, in quest of its fourth consecutive men's title, has an even bigger 
lead, 422-314, over Oakland University (Mich.). Northridge is in seventh place 
with 104 points. 
</P>
<P>
Six Division II records were set Friday, including two by the Northridge 
women's team, which is seeking its third championship in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matador team of Jude Kylander, Stacey Mettam, Michelle Sulak and Toady 
Kimble started the night with a 1:34.83 effort in the 200-yard freestyle relay. 
That broke the previous Division II standard of 1:35.58 set by North Dakota in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
It was Mettam's 23.6 split on the second leg that put CSUN into the record 
book. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea where that came from," said the senior, who was competing in a 
freestyle relay for the first time. Mettam's specialty is the backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, a legitimate sprinter, brought the Lady Matadors home with a time of 
23.1 over the final 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Mettam and Kylander were also members of a CSUN team that broke the 400-yard 
medley relay record with a time of 3:52.64 in the last event of the night. The 
previous mark was 3:54.17 set by Northridge last year. 
</P>
<P>
Kylander swam an especially impressive 51.14 freestyle portion on the relay. 
Mettam turned in a 58.7 in the backstroke, followed by Tina Schnare (1:04.63 in 
the breaststroke) and Tina Dodson (58.17 in the butterfly). 
</P>
<P>
Other records were set in the men's 200-yard freestyle relay (Oakland, 
1:22.46); men's 400-yard medley relay (Oakland, 3:21.55); women's 400-yard 
individual medley (Ann Wycoff of Army, 4:30.72); and the men's 400-yard 
individual medley (Andrew Shattuck of Bakersfield, 3:57.73). 
</P>
<P>
Among other highlights for the Northridge women's team was a high-scoring 
finish in the 200-yard freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Kylander finished second in a personal-best 1:52.52. She was followed closely 
by teammate Jeanna Giessinger, third in 1:53.32. Michelle Sulak of CSUN won the 
event's consolation championship in 1:53.99. 
</P>
<P>
Schnare can tie Wycoff, who swam her final event of the meet Friday -- for 
career individual titles (eight) with a victory in the 200-yard breaststroke 
today. Schnare, the top qualifier by more than two seconds, is also the 
Division II record-holder in the event. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's competition, Northridge junior Ted Hollahan failed to successfully 
defend his championship in the 200-yard freestyle, finishing second in 1:38.71. 
Hilton Woods, a sophomore from Oakland, came from half a body length behind in 
the last 50 yards to out-touch Hollahan in 1:38.35. 
</P>
<P>
Hollahan will have a chance to redeem himself against Woods -- who also 
defeated him in the 50-yard freestyle -- in the 100-yard race today. 
</P>
<P>
Hollahan won the event last year in a record-setting time of 44.65. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened tonight might be the best thing for me," Hollahan said. "Now 
I'll be shooting at someone again instead of everyone shooting at me."

NORTHRIDGE ADVANCES TO REGIONAL FINAL, 68-54 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was not pretty. And that is a charitable assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge committed 34 turnovers Friday night against Florida 
Atlantic in the opening round of the NCAA Division II West regional women's 
basketball tournament at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
It got so bad, the official statistician mistakenly credited the Lady Matadors 
with 44 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
But with Florida Atlantic contributing 31 turnovers of its own, keeping track 
was no routine matter. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Northridge, style is not a prerequisite for victory. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, the 14th-ranked Lady Matadors showed a flair for regaining 
their composure amid trying times and came away with a 68-54 win in Kellogg 
Gym. 
</P>
<P>
The victory advances Northridge (22-8) to the regional final at 7:30 tonight 
against third-ranked Pomona (25-5), which defeated Cal State Hayward, 82-69, 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't pretty but we came out and did what we needed to when we had to. So 
I'm happy with that," Northridge Coach Leslie Milke said. "For the last six 
minutes we did a pretty good job, but for the first 34 . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Florida Atlantic (21-8), an independent school from Boca Raton, made it this 
far using a platoon substitution system. Five of the Owls' seven losses had 
come against Division I opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was the pressure of being in the playoffs for the first time. Maybe it 
was the long trip from Florida and a three-week break since its last game. 
Whatever the reason, Florida Atlantic shot just 28% (22 for 76) from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"They threw us off stride defensively," Owl Coach Wayne Allen said. "We could 
never get in our pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought our two-platoon system would wear them down, but they were in real 
good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge led, 28-27, at halftime, but the Owls, behind the play of forward 
Yvette Clark -- who scored 13 of her 18 points in the second half -- took a 
43-42 lead with 10:21 left. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Arlotto, who scored a team-high 18 points, Paula Lucas (17) and Bridgette 
Ealy (nine) keyed a methodical seven-minute run that put Northridge ahead, 
56-49, and secured the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted this game so bad because we wanted to play Pomona again," said 
Northridge center Chris Cavalin, who had 12 points and a game-high 18 rebounds. 
"Even though we didn't play well tonight, I think we're going to have a good 
game tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors, who shot 47%, will have to play more than a good game if 
they hope to beat Pomona and reverse the outcome of the 1986 West regional 
final when Pomona defeated CSUN en route to winning its third national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's game will be the fourth meeting of the season between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
After losing the first match-up during California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
regular-season play, Northridge beat Pomona in Kellogg Gym on Feb. 23, snapping 
the Lady Matadors' 29-game losing streak to the Lady Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
But last weekend, Pomona beat Northridge, 75-62, to win the CCAA tournament, 
which earned the Lady Broncos their eighth consecutive CCAA title and an 
automatic berth in the regional. 
</P>
<P>
For Northridge to be successful, the Lady Matadors are going to have to find a 
way to control Pomona center Niki Bracken, who scored 30 points and had 11 
rebounds against Northridge in the CCAA tournament final and was named 
tournament MVP for the second year in a row. Bracken scored 32 points against 
Hayward on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We know what to expect," Milke said. "I don't think we're going to do anything 
really different than what we tried to do last week. I'm just hoping we execute 
better than we did last time."

HOOVER RALLIES TO GIVE COACH 400TH WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hoover High scored six runs in the top of the sixth inning to defeat La Salle, 
7-2, Friday in a nonleague game and give Coach Bob Cooper his 400th career 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, who has coached at Hoover for 14 years after stints at Elsinore and 
Harvard highs, reached the milestone in his 25th year of coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had some real good luck," Cooper said. "And I've had some good teams." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's career mark stands at 400-197, but it took a six-run rally in the 
sixth for Hoover (3-0) to wipe out a 2-1 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Eight Hoover starters hit safely, including David Berkey, who was two for 
three. Berkey recorded his first save in relief of Bryan Day (1-0), who pitched 
five innings. 
</P>
<P>
In other nonleague games: 
</P>
<P>
St. Genevieve 8, Palmdale 2 -- Roland De La Maza scattered five hits and struck 
out 12 at Branford Park. De La Maza (2-1) struck out seven in a row during the 
first, second and third innings and had 12 in the first five innings. 
</P>
<P>
De La Maza, who struck out 21 batters in a 10-inning victory over Palmdale last 
year, has 31 strikeouts in 16 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Royal 5, Murphy 4 -- Dennis Gildehauf scored from third base, breaking a 4-4 
tie in the bottom of the eighth, when Murphy shortstop Larry Bator booted a 
Steve Bernstein ground ball. Bill Egan struck out 11 for Royal in 6 2/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Calabasas 7, Oak Park 0 -- Brett Resnick was four for five with a run batted 
in, scored two runs and had two steals, and Dave Kalman was two for five with 
two RBIs to lead Calabasas (2-1) at Oak Park. Scott Faer, Brett Farlow and Dan 
Glassman combined for a two-hitter. Glassman faced eight batters and struck out 
five.EL SEGUNDO TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
Hart 13, Long Beach Poly 5 -- Junior Lance Migita had four hits and scored 
three runs to lead Hart's 12-hit attack at Long Beach Poly. 
</P>
<P>
Hart (3-1) wiped out a 3-1 deficit with four runs in the third, two in the 
fourth, five in the fifth and one in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Gardocki was three for four with three RBIs, and Casey Burrill had three 
RBIs. Winning pitcher Andrew Lorraine (2-0) allowed five runs (three earned) 
and struck out four. Hart will play host to El Segundo at 11 this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi 6, Millikan 5 -- Chris Romero singled to score Tim Weir and cap a 
four-run Crespi rally in the seventh. That wiped out a four-run seventh by 
Millikan, which parlayed a walk and four singles into four runs. 
</P>
<P>
In the Crespi seventh, Scott Barton and Mark D'Antonio hit back-to-back one-out 
singles, scoring Don Calabria. Back-to-back walks accounted for another run, 
and D'Antonio scored when Andy MacDonald reached base on a fielder's choice. 
After an intentional walk to John Dempsey, Romero singled to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi (2-1-1) will play at Banning at 11 this morning for 13th place. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo 9, Westlake 8 -- Mike Lieberthal of Westlake hit a grand slam in the 
fourth inning, but Westlake (2-2) surrendered three runs in the seventh to lose 
at Westlake in a game marred by nine errors by each team. 
</P>
<P>
With Westlake trailing, 9-7, in the bottom of the seventh, the Warriors loaded 
the bases. Matt McHendry whacked a fly to center to score a run, but Mike Eby 
was picked off first to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake's Tim Falsken was two for three with a double. Lieberthal had five 
RBIs, the other coming on a sacrifice fly. Westlake will play at Long Beach 
Poly today at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus 4, Alhambra 2 -- Senior left-hander Scott Warr threw a five-hitter to 
lead Saugus at home. Warr (1-0) struck out four and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Roger Salkeld was three for three with a double and Darrell Davis 
was two for three for Saugus (2-1-1), which plays at Arcadia today at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia 10, Burroughs 5 -- Arcadia scored five times in the fourth inning to 
take a 10-3 lead and control of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs senior Chris Westbury was two for three, including a triple, and had 
two RBIs. Westbury, however, who started for Burroughs (2-2), was chased in the 
third inning as Arcadia (3-1) scored four times. Burroughs plays Alhambra at 
home today at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
HIGHLAND HALL TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
Highland Hall 13, Valley Torah 3 -- Jakob Jensen pitched a two-hitter, struck

KENNEDY OUTRUNS TAFT BY WINNING 11 EVENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the Kennedy High boys' track team was devastated by 25 academic 
ineligibilities several weeks ago, the Golden Cougars still have a talented -- 
albeit small -- squad. They lack quantity, but not quality. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy demonstrated quality in a 73-54 victory over visiting Taft on Friday in 
a Northwest Valley Conference meet. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's victory overshadowed a brilliant performance by Taft's Greg Sheets, 
who won the pole vault with a personal best of 15 feet, 1 inch. Sheets, the 
runner-up to Jay Bettinger of Chatsworth in last year's City Section 
championships, had a previous best of 15-0. 
</P>
<P>
Antiwaun Carter, Jorge Duran, Patrick Blake and Cord Bailey were all 
instrumental in Kennedy's win as the Golden Cougars (2-0) won 11 of 15 events 
and nine of 10 track events. 
</P>
<P>
Carter won the 100 meters in 11.4 and the 220 yards in 23.5, and anchored the 
victorious 440 relay (46.3). Duran won the mile (4:39.8) and two mile 
(10:14.7); Blake won the 120-yard high hurdles in 16.9 and the 330 intermediate 
hurdles in 44.6. Bailey won the triple jump at 40-6 and placed second in the 
high jump (5-10) and second in the long jump (20-0). 
</P>
<P>
In other boys' meets: 
</P>
<P>
Reseda 70, North Hollywood 53 -- Aaron Brumfield won the triple jump and high 
jump for Reseda (4-0, 2-0) in the Valley Pac-8 Conference meet at North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando 74, Canoga Park 43 -- The host Tigers were led in the Northwest 
Valley Conference meet by Ibed Aguirre, who won the mile (4:51.9) and two mile 
(10:22.8), and Howard McCrary, who won the 120-yard high hurdles (15.7) and 
triple jump (42-3 1/2). 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham 113, Sylmar 10 -- Brian Gastelum won three events for host 
Birmingham (2-0) in the Valley Pac-8 Conference meet. Gastelum, a junior, won 
the 800 in a personal best of 2:00.6, the 1,600 in 4:50.0 and the 3,200 in 
10:29.3. 
</P>
<P>
GIRLS' TRACK 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 61, Taft 48 -- Taft won seven of 13 events, but the Golden Cougars' 
superior depth prevailed in the Northwest Valley Conference meet at Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Natasha Como and Lela Lemell helped Kennedy dominate the sprints. 
</P>
<P>
Como won the 100 meters in 13.0, the 220 yards in 27.9 and anchored the 
victorious 440 relay (53.0). Lemell, a sophomore, won the 440 in 1:04.3. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills 63, El Camino Real 45 -- Shaunte Parker won two individual events 
and anchored two victorious relays for host Granada Hills in the Northwest 
Valley Conference meet. 
</P>
<P>
Poly 66, Van Nuys 38 -- Tina Means led Van Nuys (2-0) in the Valley Pac-8 
Conference meet at Poly by winning the 110-meter low hurdles, the 330-yard lows 
and the high jump. 
</P>
<P>
BOYS' VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth d. Westchester, 15-4, 15-13, 15-11 -- Greg Weaver had 16 kills and 
Chris Gleason added 11 to lead the Chancellors (2-0) in a nonleague match. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard d. Crespi 15-10, 15-13, 15-6 -- Mark Shoptaw had 17 kills and Rick 
Osterloh had six kills and six stuff blocks for host Harvard (3-0) in a 
nonleague match. 
</P>
<P>
Royal d. San Gabriel, 15-9, 12-15, 15-1, 8-15, 15-5 -- Craig Parker had 21 
kills and Matt Brown had 10 kills and eight stuff blocks to lead host Royal to 
a nonleague win. 
</P>
<P>
BOYS' TENNIS 
</P>
<P>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stock prices were dragged lower Friday by heightened inflation fears after the 
government reported that U.S. unemployment dropped to a 15-year low last month. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials dropped 9.29 to 2,282.14, reducing its 
gain for the week to 7.85 points. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with Big Board volume edging up to 
146.83 million shares from 143.36 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.1%, 
a 15-year low, in February from 5.4% the month before. 
</P>
<P>
The report also showed an increase of 289,000 in non-farm payroll employment, 
topping most advance estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The report indicates that the expansion is picking up steam and that the 
Federal Reserve may soon tighten credit to wring inflation out of the economy, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street had been anxiously awaiting the report all week, hoping for new 
evidence that economic growth was slowing, taking upward pressure off inflation 
and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
So the figures were poorly received in both the bond and stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
However, most of the selling hit the stock market early in the day, when the 
Dow Jones industrials' loss approached 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the market's partial recovery in late trading was encouraged by a 
feeling that the latest data might not prompt any immediate further 
credit-tightening moves from the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Losers among the blue chips included International Business Machines, down 3/8 
at 118 1/4; General Electric, down 1/2 at 45; General Motors, down 3/4 at 84 
3/4, and American Express, down 5/8 at 30. 
</P>
<P>
Upjohn dropped 1/8 to 29 1/4 in active trading after losing 2 1/4 points 
Thursday. Responding to an analyst's report, the company said it was too soon 
to gauge the effect of new prescription procedures in New York State on sales 
of two Upjohn tranquilizers. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Communications climbed 1 7/8 to 49 and Time Inc. rose 3 1/2 to 115 3/4. 
There was conjecture on Wall Street that either or both companies might have 
opened themselves up as prospective takeover targets with their announcement 
last weekend of plans to merge. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities closed at 2,900.399, down 8.787. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks dropped 0.51 to 
164.85. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.26 to 338.17, and S&amp;P's 
500-stock composite index was down 1.26 at 338.17. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose 0.23 to 405.90. 
At the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index closed at 328.92, down 
0.44.

In Japan, stocks edged higher in late trading Friday, as program buying helped 
the market recover from earlier declines. The Nikkei 225-share index rose 45.33 
to 31,701.78, ending the week 298.22 points lower.

Share prices also closed higher in London, shaking off the depressing influence 
of early losses on Wall Street, as buying interest emerged at the beginning of 
a new trading account during which Britain's fiscal 1990 budget is to be 
presented. The Financial Times 100-share index finished 9.3 higher at 2,085.2.

BALLET THEATRE SHOWS FOUR FACES OF TWYLA THARP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music/Dance Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Look Tharp. Be Tharp. 
</P>
<P>
American Ballet Theatre is sending out a new aesthetic message these days. It 
is, of course, all about Twyla. 
</P>
<P>
Which Twyla? That is the question. Thursday night at Shrine Auditorium, a large 
and happy crowd saw at least four of them. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Upper Room," introduced in its balletic incarnation in Orange County 
last December, found the choreographer delving in a piquant oxymoron: 
sophisticated minimalism. To the deafening, relentlessly repetitive strains of 
Philip Glass, she oversaw a delirious rumble that pitted the prim pointe-shoe 
gang against the loose-limbed stompers in sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
For "The Bum's Rush," which received its premiere last month in Chicago, Tharp 
turned to quaint and fussy vaudeville turns. Some of them turned out to be 
beguiling. 
</P>
<P>
This quasi-narrative venture -- call it a super-skit -- dabbled in jazz-pop 
indulgences, hobo-clown routines, sight gags (the best ones involving a truck 
tire that sprouts ballerina's feet), verbal counterpoint (some of it 
intentionally intelligible), survival metaphors smothered amid ancient 
burlesque rituals and beneath the slam-bang pratfalls of a little 
break-dancing. 
</P>
<P>
By normally tough-and-tart Tharp standards, this was sweet and indulgent if 
diffuse. Also cute, cute, cute. 
</P>
<P>
For a taut formalist antidote, our heroine offered "Quartet," first seen in 
Miami five weeks ago. This was stark Tharp plotting a cool, vigorous, rigorous, 
analytical exercise. It looked abstract in style, probing in content, 
uncompromising in structure. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the Kronos-esque impulses of Terry Riley's "G Song," Tharp tried to 
celebrate the clarification of complexity. She often succeeded. In the process, 
she explored the expressive possibilities of fragmenting balletic gesture and 
compartmentalizing balletic movement. She constantly juxtaposed nonchalant 
point with frantic counterpoint. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there was the Broadway-baby Tharp of "Everlast," a period piece first 
seen here on Tuesday. On second viewing, it still seemed spiffy, flimsy, 
amusing and a bit hyper-extended. 
</P>
<P>
It left some quandaries unresolved. Why does the choreographer bother with the 
seemingly arbitrary pretense of a performance within a performance? Why is the 
scenery on the mock-Palace stage set up backwards? Why aren't the Jerome Kern 
warblers -- over-amplified this time -- relegated to the pit? 
</P>
<P>
Since opening night, this writer -- a shameless non-aficionado in matters 
pugilistic -- has been enlightened regarding the meaning of the title. In case 
you care, "Everlast" is the name of the company that manufactures, among other 
amenities, the boxer's shorts. As for the subtitle: "A Gypsy Run-Through" is 
what the folks in the great white way call a dressy rehearsal presented for an 
audience of chorus dancers employed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Not since "Rosebud". . . . 
</P>
<P>
The second time around, the innocent observer could ignore some of the clutter 
and savor some basics: Kevin O'Day's spectacular rope-skipping solo, Susan 
Jaffe's insinuating blues variation, the blissful appropriation of prize-fight 
maneuvers and ball-room rhetoric, the busy-body duo functioning as connective 
thread as well as Greek chorus. The Kern tunes continued to charm, even if they 
threatened to overstay their welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Getting Tharp invention in four generous, eclectic portions in one long sitting 
was stimulating. She obviously represents a bracing presence for the dancers, 
and she certainly pleases the audience. She is, if nothing else, clever. On the 
basis of this sampling, however, one must wonder if she still wants to be a 
challenger and a provocateur. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Upper Room" exploits the trendiness of the postmodern cliches it 
quotes. Though different in scope, both "Bum's Rush" and "Everlast" resort to 
candy-coating. "Quartet," the smallest piece on this bill, is the most 
demanding and the least accessible. It forces the participants on either side 
of the proscenium to do a little stretching. In the long run, we need, and 
deserve, more of that. 
</P>
<P>
The performances on Thursday were appropriately dazzling. Ballet Theatre seems 
to be in fine fettle, even though the boss, Mikhail Baryshnikov, doesn't happen 
to be on the premises. He is busy creeping around a Broadway stage in the 
reportedly inspired guise of a Kafka insect. 
</P>
<P>
The democratic ensemble of "In the Upper Room" no doubt could have danced up 
the wonted stage smoke by itself. The offstage machines that belched all those 
gray clouds were probably superfluous. 
</P>
<P>
The trivia of "Bum's Rush" was pursued with special bravado by Shelley 
Washington, Richard Colton, Gil Boggs and Kevin O'Day as the primary dancing 
derelicts. Sandra Brown provided the slippered tippy toes of the rubber tire. 
Elaine Kudo suffered the back-breaking, leg-crunching tortures of the 
mock-ballerina with stoic cheer. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone looked cozy in Santo Loquasto's funky junkyard decors. The set meowed, 
incidentally, in meek evocation of "Cats." Dick Hyman wrote and supervised the 
execution of the witty musical sleaze. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Gregory, Cynthia Harvey, Ricardo Busatamante and Guillaume Graffin 
served as the virtuosic, hard-working quartet in "Quartet." They even mustered 
individuality in the face of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble in "Everlast," the same as on Tuesday, again oozed snazz and 
pizazz. In context, Susan Jaffe's knowing refinement provided a particularly 
useful jolt.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'DEAD MAN OUT' A SHARP INDICTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Dead Man Out" is a stirring lobby against a system that seeks to make people 
well in order to kill them. The fine, evocative, deeply moving HBO prison drama 
airs at 8 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
You may fault its message but not its effectiveness in making you care about 
its characters or the way it draws you inside their thoughts. This is powerful 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Ironies and paradoxes define the protagonists of Ron Hutchinson's grim and 
troubling story. Court psychiatrist Alex Marsh (Danny Glover) is assigned to 
work with an especially difficult, incommunicative Death-Row prisoner named Ben 
(Ruben Blades), who seems to have gone insane, giving him a reprieve from 
execution. Marsh's job is to certify Ben mentally "competent" so that the state 
can take his life, just as Ben took the lives of four innocent people in a 
senseless robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Hutchinson and director Richard Pearce subtly expose the inner minds of their 
characters without completely unmasking them, compromising them or submerging 
them in false sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
The slow-evolving relationship of Marsh and Ben, during which a certain amount 
of bonding and role reversal occurs, is painful and fascinating to watch. In 
making Ben re-examine the roots and consequences of his bleak, destructive 
life, Marsh must face his own demons and the meaning of his assignment. 
</P>
<P>
Glover is excellent as the self-doubting Marsh, and Blades gives a seething, 
raging, slashing performance to remember as Ben, whose coarse eloquence speaks 
for itself. "Don't you think it's loony," he asks, "to tell a guy, 'Thou shalt 
not kill, and to rubber it in, we ice you?' " 
</P>
<P>
Pearce artfully conveys the gray, claustrophobic doom of Death Row while 
expanding on psychological and intellectual levels a movie that probes deeply 
moral and ethical issues. 
</P>
<P>
What "Dead Man Out" doesn't do is lay enough legal foundation for Marsh's 
assignment by clearly noting that the U.S. Supreme Court has held that 
executing an insane person constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. What "Dead 
Man Out" does do is provide memorable viewing.

'UP IN SARATOGA' -- A GOOD IDEA GONE WRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's amazing what can happen to good ideas on their way to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed like a good idea to take an old farce with a solid track record 
(Bronson Howard's 1870 "Saratoga"), dust it off and rewrite it for a modern 
audience with a new title: "Up in Saratoga." 
</P>
<P>
It seemed like a good idea to have playwright farceur Terrence McNally ("The 
Ritz," "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune") deliver the reconstructed 
script. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed like a great idea to have Jack O'Brien, a man who could direct the 
phone book con brio, stage it. But the results at the Old Globe, where "Up in 
Saratoga" opened Thursday, prove only, again, that there are no guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
The play is a mess. 
</P>
<P>
Every ingredient known to Georges Feydeau, Neil Simon and Michael Frayn has 
been thrown into this stew. It is framed -- literally -- in a sumptuous, 
gilt-edged set by Douglas W. Schmidt, draped in the swirling or dapper elegance 
of Robert Wojewodski's costumes, anointed with light by David F. Segal, 
punctuated with songs by composer Bob James, sprinkled with Scott Joplin and 
other period music, primped, powdered, propped up and ordered to live. To no 
avail. 
</P>
<P>
This saga of a young man whose helpless romanticism makes him fall in love with 
every lovely in his path (and to become engaged to several at once), unfolds 
with the predictable and unpredictable intrigue and imbroglio one might expect. 
The plot is as twisted as a telephone cord and in this McNally incarnation, 
it's like pushing rocks uphill. 
</P>
<P>
For the first two acts this extravaganza is all period posturing and exposition 
and asides to the audience and carefully timed exits and entrances. But 
something's missing from the start. There's flavor, but no leavening. The 
confection won't rise. Characters twitter, bluster, mince, scheme, sashay, 
simper and sigh, but it all feels like work. 
</P>
<P>
Scene changing interludes in Act II between a maid (Vicki Lewis) and a butler 
(Sterling Macer) wither from terminal cuteness. The James songs, delivered as 
Olio numbers and sung in a nasal whine by Lewis, seem extraneous. 
</P>
<P>
By Act III, particularly the final scene of Act III peppered with gunshots, 
screaming women and slamming doors, the mayhem has become so forced, the effort 
to make us laugh so driven and at such a fever pitch, that an audience can only 
sit back limp, assaulted, amazed and unamused. 
</P>
<P>
A program note from the director tells us that despite the play's derivation, 
every word is McNally's. It's an assertion we don't doubt, since "Up in 
Saratoga" is riddled with intentional anachronisms ("I've heard of male 
bonding, but this is ridiculous") and contemporary buzzwords ("Tsawright?" -- 
"Tsawright"). Paraphrased song titles become lines of dialogue ("You've got it 
bad and that's not good"). That sort of indulgence dates and dooms a text. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate in-joke drew a hiss of consternation opening night, as the young 
hero claims to have tickets to "Bronson Howard's new play, 'Frankie and Johnny 
in the Clair de Lune.' " It's downhill from there, hitting a nadir at "Lie down 
with actresses wake up with fleas." 
</P>
<P>
What's an actor to do? The poor ones here work relentlessly, huffing and 
puffing their little hearts out trying to entertain us. 
</P>
<P>
The young men are brash and engaging (Jon Tenney is the hapless Romeo, William 
Duff-Griffin his buddy and cohort), the young women are lissome and lively 
(Finn Carter, Lauren Mitchell, Marietta DePrima and Mary-Louise Parker). Jack 
Fletcher accomplishes the remarkable feat of playing a fey buffoon without 
surrendering a shred of dignity. Mitchell Edmonds, Dorothy Constantine, 
Laurence Guittard, Richard Kneeland offer better than competent support, but 
they can't rise above the play. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere along the line, McNally and O'Brien, working together, lost sight of 
the ultimate goal. The lavish Old Globe production gilds a counterfeit lily. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of high energy, bucks and hopes have gone into this monster, but its 
chances of being salvageable are slim. It's all style over content. What should 
have been wit and daring is replaced by trivial pursuit, clarity by confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Farce may spring from muddle, but just as stage boredom can't be allowed to be 
boring, stage confusion needs to be clear. 
</P>
<P>
"Up in Saratoga's" situations are so mixed up that it's a night's work to keep 
track of them. Nothing organically funny emerges from this labyrinth of events. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, we're given a frenzied three-hour-plus white elephant from which we 
come out numb, humming the sets and costumes.

Like Stevens, I have embraced the Islamic faith. Contrary to those quoted in 
your articles, Stevens hasn't changed from a kind man into a barbarian. 
Non-Muslims do not appreciate a Muslim's jealousy for his faith in the face of 
such vicious attacks as Rushdie's novel. 
</P>
<P>
No, Yousuf Islam is not some evil caricature of his former self. He is the same 
thoughtful man who has sought after truth and has committed himself to what he 
believes in.

FACES . . .: STILL LOOKING FOR LOVE

<P>
Will somebody please cast M. Emmet Walsh as a romantic lead? 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how I fall into the trap of doing those bad guys," the 
53-year-old actor says genially. "I'm still waiting to do a role with a toupee. 
And they never let me play Jamie Lee Curtis' love interest. In USA Today, Mike 
Clark said it was nice to see me back -- after 'Clean and Sober' -- in the kind 
of roles that had made my career: 'playing cesspools in colored shirts.' " 
</P>
<P>
The cesspool of the moment is a CIA operative on the tail of some missing money 
in the Jamaica-set, Denzel Washington-starrer "The Mighty Quinn" opening 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only nine or 10 of us who do what I do," Walsh says of his 
character-actor status. "How it happens is you get old and decrepit and bald 
and finally they start hiring you. It's not that you're good or anything. They 
figure if you've survived, you must be talented." 
</P>
<P>
He laughed. "One learns one's craft, has a couple of lucky breaks, like 
'Straight Time' with Dustin Hoffman, 'Blood Simple.' I've done a lot of movies 
-- 59 of them. And my career has been helped a lot by cable. Suddenly, people 
are looking at movies from 20 years ago, saying, 'Look, that's Emmet Walsh. He 
had hair, he wasn't fat.' " 
</P>
<P>
Walsh is equally self-deprecating about his current gumshoe role in the NBC 
crime-solving series "UNSUB" ("They waved a great deal of money at me, which 
was very hard to refuse.") and the upcoming film, "Chatahoochie," with Gary 
Oldman and Dennis Hopper. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood has finally recognized me as a sex symbol," the actor boasts, 
"realized I could be trusted in certain types of roles. So they gave me a love 
interest in 'Chatahoochie.' Of course, it turned out to be another male 
prisoner who likes to wear dresses. . . ." JANICE ARKATOV

I was outraged when a TV "investigative" show reported the private memo Gumbel 
wrote to an executive. In my family, it's taboo to touch another's mail or 
repeat something told in confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the report was broadcast, I asked a family member, "Where in hell 
is TV headed?" Soon after, I added: "Pardon me; I just answered my own 
question."

Since I retired, I've watched NBC's "Today," which makes oldsters feel a bit 
important by showing photos of some who have lived past 90 or 100. Bless 
Willard Scott's heart -- he's sure to say of a picture, "Isn't she beautiful?" 
But, I have noticed, the rude Bryant Gumbel has a sneer on his face throughout 
this. 
</P>
<P>
We oldsters should be fussed over: We have retirement salaries to spend and 
plenty of time to shop.

DAVID NELSON / SOCIETY: A HIGH-FASHION STRUT FOR THE JUNIOR LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of the Junior League of San Diego say that they are eager to shed the 
young matrons-in-white gloves-and-pearls image acquired through decades of 
community service, and, to prove the point, the group celebrated its 60th 
anniversary Saturday by hosting a black-tie gala and fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Marriott catered to a half-dozen major groups that evening, but 
it was easy to spot the Junior Leaguers among the swarms of party-goers 
(including 850 Little Caesar's Pizza conventioneers in tomato sauce-colored 
ties and 250 roistering Mack Truck guests) who streamed through the hotel's 
broad corridors like schools of salmon heading home. 
</P>
<P>
The 550 League members and spouses gave the definite impression of folks 
stepping out for a dandy night on the town, and, as the evening unfolded, "A 
Shimmering Diamond Jubilee" seemed to meet the expectations of all of them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Third in Series of Galas 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's high-fashion strut was the third in a string of annual galas that 
began as something of an experiment in 1987, since, up to that time, the group 
never had gone the black-tie route, preferring to restrict its fund-raising 
activities to its famous annual rummage sale and other less-splashy events. 
</P>
<P>
However, the gala approach has proven a sure money-maker for the League, which, 
true to form, has made volunteerism the focus. In the case of Saturday's gala 
and its predecessors, the volunteerism included not only the event committee, 
but those League members and their families who stepped forward to step down 
the runway in one of the calendar's only homespun -- and thus eminently 
enjoyable -- fashion presentations. 
</P>
<P>
The participation of 71 members, spouses and children in the show served, in a 
way, to take the group back to its roots, since the local Junior League came 
into being after the Junior League of Pasadena put on the entertainment that 
opened the 1927 Charity Ball, at that time San Diego's peerless social event. 
The Junior League idea was relatively new at the time -- it was founded in New 
York in 1901 by heiress and socialite Mary Harriman -- and was intended to give 
young married women of means an opportunity to perform useful community 
service. Community service remains the centerpiece of the League's purpose, but 
the membership has changed with the times to reflect the new roles of women. 
</P>
<P>
Those new roles, and the way they affect League membership and activities, were 
a chief concern of gala chairman Ann Davies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change in Membership 
</P>
<P>
"Our membership has changed significantly in the last 10 years," she said. 
"Then, it was young mothers who had time to volunteer, but now 70% are 
professional women. The League reflects the new places of women in society, and 
a lot of them no longer have the discretionary hours to give the community. 
This situation is one the League will have to seriously address." 
</P>
<P>
Because the hours available for volunteerism have shrunk, fund raising has 
become more important to the League, Davies said. She expected her gala to 
raise more than $80,000, which she described as a "remarkable sum" in light of 
the fact that tickets were $100 each. Underwriting made up the balance of the 
earnings and covered the party's expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Co-chairwoman Gretchen Colachis emphasized the League programs that will 
benefit from the gala, including co-sponsorship of the National Convention for 
the Prevention of Teen-Age Dropouts, to be held in April at the Town &amp; 
Country Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the public is aware of how hard the League works on its projects 
-- we do a lot of community outreach programs, and they take a lot of money," 
Colachis said. "The League has changed. It's not a lot of unemployed 
dilettantes whiling away their free hours. Now we work with troubled teens and 
drug abuse, and I'd like to disabuse the public of its image of us as young 
matrons in pearls. Most of us work, and work hard." 
</P>
<P>
The League's 450 active members did in fact contribute 65,000 hours to 
volunteer projects in 1988, but lest the members seem like so many bees eager 
to inject a little sweetness into the community, be assured that they do know 
how to enjoy themselves. "A Shimmering Diamond Jubilee" focused on enjoyment, 
beginning with the Neiman-Marcus fashion show of contemporary people -- 
including a toddler who predictably stole the show -- in contemporary fashions. 
</P>
<P>
The members and their families looked thoroughly at home on the ramp, and the 
show closed, as always, with a bride, although on this occasion the moment was 
taken as a tongue-in-cheek gesture, since she wore see-through black crepe that 
ended well above the knee. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner of chicken stuffed with apples and baked Alaska (a great favorite of 
the Marriott catering staff, this ice cream cake appears at many functions) 
concluded, the party returned to the pursuit of amusement by jamming onto the 
dance floor and wailing along with the Mar Dels. 
</P>
<P>
A short formal interlude honored six honorary chairmen, all sustaining League 
members who helped guide the group toward its status as a major force in San 
Diego volunteerism. In the group were Liz Jessop, Jane Fetter, Alison Gildred, 
Kay Porter, Yvonne Larsen and Alice Miller. All contributed reminiscences to 
the program, and Miller's suggested that the League long has been closer to its 
present ideals than many current members may suppose. She represented the group 
at its national meeting in Seattle in 1940, and emerged from the conference to 
hear the shouts of news vendors announcing that Germany had invaded Holland. A 
few months later, she retired as president of the Junior League of San Diego 
and went to work in an aircraft factory. 
</P>
<P>
The committee included Kathleen Baczynski, Hilary Gauntt, Jane Sexton, Marcia 
Younie, Laurie Petter, Mary Davidson, Eleanor Navarra, Kim Woolley, Beverly 
Stenderup, Vicki Goyet, Myra Beare, Mary Kaye Burns, Libby Levine and Susan 
Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Among guests were League president Susan McClellan and her husband, Craig, John 
Davies, Alice and Richard Cramer, Chris and Craig Andrews, Mary and Dallas 
Clark, Gus Colachis, Judi and Richard Freeman, Cheryl Ayers and Ron Kendrick, 
Karon and Gordon Luce, Trisha and Don Worley, Robin and Peter Jovanovich, and 
Maureen and Charlie King.

GREGORY PECK ACCEPTS AFI LIFE AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL ROSENFIELD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has become a tradition for winners of the American Film Institute's Life 
Achievement Award to polish off their evening tribute with a speech that 
provides a personal perspective of their careers, some highlights, anecdotes 
and some words of appreciation for the joy the industry has given them. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Peck, who became the 17th recipient of the award Thursday at the 
Beverly Hilton International Ballroom, did all that, and a little bit more. The 
tall, silver-haired star gave one of the event's most eloquent and well-humored 
speeches, but veered from form long enough to chastise the film and television 
industries for commercial pandering and urged them to put as much faith in 
quality and originality as in making money. 
</P>
<P>
Peck, speaking bluntly to an audience he knew included heads of studios and 
television networks, warned about the corporate buying up of television 
companies, studios, magazines, newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to hear some glamorous talk about the quality of work," he said. 
"Imagination is the priceless resource, and it's going undervalued." 
</P>
<P>
Peck also made a couple of references to the 6-year hiatus between his last two 
films, an apparent retirement that wasn't his idea. Peck was not even the first 
choice for "Old Gringo," which Columbia Pictures will release later this year; 
he was hired as a last-minute replacement for Burt Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Back on the career track, Peck listed William Wellman, Raoul Walsh, Stanley 
Kramer, Elia Kazan and the other great directors he's worked with, but stopped 
just short of giving them credit for his success: "I owe them so much," he 
said, adding quickly, "but not everything." 
</P>
<P>
One by one, Peck's co-stars stood to praise him, both for his acting and his 
steady professionalism, and for his commitment to humanitarian causes. Charlton 
Heston, whose political conservatism is a far distance from Peck's liberalism, 
referred to their differences of opinion, but said he respected the commitment. 
</P>
<P>
The most expansive praise came from the women with whom he shared the screen. 
</P>
<P>
"From the moment Greg arrived in Hollywood, he was an event," said Dorothy 
McGuire, who co-founded the La Jolla Playhouse with Peck. "Greg came here under 
the banner of David -- (David O. Selznick) and we already had the Duke (John 
Wayne), Coop (Gary Cooper), Jimmy (Stewart, who was at McGuire's table). But 
the serape, the mantle -- whatever stardom is -- was immediately extended to 
Greg." 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen beauties -- from host Audrey Hepburn to best-dressed Angie 
Dickinson -- talked about Peck's looks, and how great they are. ("Tall, 
beautiful, gentle, a famous hero," said Audrey Hepburn.) But looks don't take 
you the distance. 
</P>
<P>
What the AFI's skillfully presented film clips revealed about Peck was his 
style. True style takes you the distance. Two of his closest male friends were 
David Niven and Fred Astaire, and Peck belonged in their company. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary Cooper looked me over when I came out here," Peck told the throng of 
1,300. "I told him I'd done two pictures, one good and one bad. And he said, 
'Then you are ahead of the game. Two good pictures out of five keeps the 
bicycle turning.' " Peck illustrated a bicycle turning with his big Captain 
Ahab arms, then added: "Two out of five for 40 years adds up." 
</P>
<P>
Not that anyone was counting, particularly. In the audience: actors Kevin 
Costner, Chevy Chase, Dennis Hopper, Mark Harmon. Executives Mike Medavoy, Alan 
Ladd Jr., Grant Tinker, Frank Wells, Tom Pollock. Directors Billy Wilder, 
Arthur Hiller, Leonard Nimoy. 
</P>
<P>
What they got was a surprising sampling of on-screen sexual chemistry. Ingrid 
Bergman in a bathrobe, eye to eye with Peck, in Alfred Hitchcock's 
"Spellbound." Jennifer Jones rubbing food in Peck's face in "Duel in the Sun." 
("It wasn't exactly the hardest job I ever had to do," a red-chiffoned Jones 
told the room.) Bacall "biting off his ear" in "Designing Woman." 
</P>
<P>
"He was possibly the most beautiful creature I'd ever seen," Bacall said, "and 
when he looks at you, he sees you, he connects with you completely." 
</P>
<P>
There were romantic clips of Peck with Jean Simmons, Deborah Kerr, Sophia 
Loren. The kiss that Ava Gardner gave Peck in "Snows of Kilimanjaro" was 
applauded by the crowd. There was Peck playing drunk to a silent Jane Fonda in 
a scene from Columbia's upcoming "Old Gringo." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought maybe he'd gotten soft," a rather recharged-looking Fonda said. 
"He's part Irish, and that means ups and downs. I thought, 'Maybe the edge is 
gone, maybe he phones it in.' His scene was three pages of emotions on a 
claustrophobic, smoke-filled set. I saw his tenacity . . . . His fear that 
maybe he couldn't do it. But he could. I said to him, 'Why do we put ourselves 
through this?' And he answered, 'Why not?' " 
</P>
<P>
Angie Dickinson, Peck's co-star in "Captain Newman, M.D.," was more political 
than nostalgic: "Universal said I had to sign a long-term contract if I wanted 
to play Fran. I thought, 'What could be worth that chunk of my life?' Then I 
thought Gregory Peck. And I said, 'Oh hell -- what's seven years anyway?' " 
</P>
<P>
It seemed, at moments, like a seven-hour evening but only because of the 
preponderance of names. Among those talking: directors and former partners Alan 
J. Pakula and Robert Mulligan, who made Peck's Oscar-winner "To Kill a 
Mockingbird," Louis Jourdan ("The Paradine Case"), Jimmy Smits, Charlton 
Heston, Sidney Poitier, Dean Stockwell, who was 9 years old when he played 
Peck's son in "Gentleman's Agreement," and Anthony Quinn, Peck's co-star on 
three occasions ("Guns of Navarone," "The World in His Arms" and "Behold a Pale 
Horse"). 
</P>
<P>
"We all wished we looked like Greg, and sounded like him," Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
When Peck took the stage, he immediately went to a joke. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend of mine was a sensitive and precise actor named James Mason. James 
didn't have a whole lot of jokes, but he told one about walking in the cold in 
Dublin and being followed by a woman, giggling. " 'Begging your pardon, sir, 
but wouldn't you be James Mason in his later years?' " That's a nice Irish 
phrase, 'later years.' It's candid, dispassionate, comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
It also implied that there were more years to come, said Peck, making the point 
that previous winners have -- that a life achievement award shouldn't mean a 
career has ended. It is a recurring irony of these AFI dinners that the legend 
being celebrated by the industry is often one who can no longer find work in 
it.

BLACK ARTISTS LINE UP FOR L.A. ENDOWMENT SHARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In another unusually strong show of local art world activism that's fast 
becoming the norm, a throng of black artists and arts administrators turned out 
Thursday night to voice concerns over spending plans for the new $20-million 
Los Angeles Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The vociferous, standing-room-only crowd of nearly 600, composed mostly of 
emerging independent artists and officials from small, struggling 
organizations, gathered at an auditorium near USC. The meeting, organized by 
actor Richard Elkins and other artists, seemed to affirm a new, active role for 
the local grass-roots art community. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are starting to design spending guidelines for the endowment, a 
new program that could increase municipal arts funding from about $5 million to 
$25 million. Last week, an overflow group of about 350 assembled at Hollywood's 
Barnsdall Park for the first meeting of the Los Angeles Arts Congress, an ad 
hoc multicultural organization formed by local artists to involve artists in 
shaping the endowment. 
</P>
<P>
The large crowds are an "unprecedented" display of advocacy, said Al Nodal, 
general manager of the city's Cultural Affairs Department and chief endowment 
administrator, after the meeting. "Pretty soon we'll have thousands." 
</P>
<P>
The endowment won't become fully operational for about a year, but some of its 
funds will be available around July and city officials have encouraged input 
from the community as they develop plans to distribute the money. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's often vitriolic participants talked of a multitude of needs for the 
black community, many stating that funding parity was a priority for what they 
called a chronically underfunded constituency. 
</P>
<P>
In an atmosphere that seemed at times like a religious revival meeting, 
independent TV producer Thomas Reed said: "If you give us $25 million or $30 
million, it means nothing because it's not filtered back to the 
African-American community. . . . It's 'I get the best and you get the rest.' " 
</P>
<P>
"That's right!" called out one member of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"That's right!" echoed another. 
</P>
<P>
The need for multimedia cultural centers and youth arts programs to avert 
inner-city crime were raised repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
"We need cultural enrichment programs for children who shouldn't be allowed to 
die culturally," said Ismael Parra of the Paul Robeson Community Center. "We 
have a facility but no money to run it." 
</P>
<P>
"We really want to see this money go where the blood is at and there is blood 
in our streets," said Kamau Daaood, noting two recent gang-related murders. 
</P>
<P>
Support for independent artists was also a common plea. 
</P>
<P>
"TV and movies don't reflect what blacks are today," said Elizabeth Rose 
Nelson, who asked for funds to produce a film. "We have positive role models to 
project on the motion picture screen." 
</P>
<P>
"I want to bring to my people our black history in visual form through (my) 
greeting cards and prints," said artist Loweta Mack. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that all African-Americans of all disciplines be given the opportunity 
to apply for and and receive funds, and not have to be affiliated with an 
organization," said Jacqueline Alexander of St. Elmo's Village cultural center. 
"The individual artist is the foundation of the art community." 
</P>
<P>
While most speakers were not known artists, some were, such as Lula Washington, 
artistic director of the Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to be able to put my dancers on salary," Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
Nodal, reiterating that the "spirit" of the endowment is to fund individuals as 
well as groups and equally support every geographic, ethnic and artistic 
community, addressed the concerns expressed, particularly the issue of parity. 
He stated that he wanted to "plug a lot of" the first endowment monies into 
areas not supported in the past, rather than larger, better established 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"There are an incredible amount of deficits in the arts community," he said. 
"It's shocking what we haven't done -- in Watts, in South-Central L.A., in the 
Valley. We've got to deal with the deficits before we can deal with equity." 
</P>
<P>
Nodal also said a 60-member endowment advisory committee composed of arts 
professionals citywide would soon be appointed and urged continued support from 
those in the audience, noting that the endowment, whose funds will be generated 
through a mix of fees on city capital improvements, most non-residential 
private development and money from the city's general fund, is not a "done 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council must deliver a final vote on the endowment around 
July, he said, and staunch opposition has been raised by private developers and 
from the city's proprietary departments, such as the Department of Water and 
Power, which do not want to pay the fee. Loss of private development and 
proprietary department revenues could drain from the endowment as much as $10 
million and $4.8 million, respectively, city officials have said.

MOSCOW JAZZ FINDS A CHAMPION IN VARTAN TONOYAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember the address: 23 Chekhov St. -- and be sure to drop by next time you're 
in Moscow. That is where you will find the Bluebird Club, the pride and joy of 
Vartan Tonoyan, who may be the Soviet Union's first jazz impresario. 
</P>
<P>
This 28-year-old Armenian, who lives outside Moscow with his mother, sister and 
a puppy named Charlie Parker, was in Los Angeles the other day. His old friend 
Alexei Zoubov, the tenor saxophonist who has lived here since 1984, was showing 
him around town. 
</P>
<P>
Tonoyan is a symbol of glasnost. In two years he has fought petty bureaucrats 
to turn his 80-capacity room from a one-night-a-week jazz venue to a 
seven-night cynosure that has drawn the elite of the Soviet and American jazz 
worlds. 
</P>
<P>
His passion for jazz began when his grandfather took him to a Duke Ellington 
concert. "My grandfather was a leader of the Armenian resistance against the 
Turks," Tonoyan explains in recently acquired though fluent English. He came to 
the United States in 1918, and stayed for 10 years; during that time he met 
Duke Ellington. When Duke played in Moscow in 1971 -- I was 11 -- I went to see 
him; later Duke came to our house and shook my hand." 
</P>
<P>
A journalism student, Tonoyan began writing about jazz in 1979. "For years it 
was difficult; they didn't want to publish my articles. Then I was told not to 
write so much about American musicians. I replied that when Soviet musicians 
play 5% as well as the Americans, I will write more about them!" 
</P>
<P>
There have been attempts to block every step in the career of the aggressive 
young promoter. For five years he tried to persuade the head of the Magazine 
Publishing Ministry to let him start the Soviet Union's first jazz magazine. He 
was told there was not enough paper to print it. 
</P>
<P>
When he approached the director of a cafe about turning it over to jazz, 
officials said nyet. "But I invited all best musicians, and journalists from 
the West, TV companies; once I pronounced that we were in business, it was too 
late for them to shut me down. 
</P>
<P>
"We began in April, 1987. Officials came in and wanted to know what percentage 
of Soviet music we played, why so many diplomats were coming in. We couldn't 
give our admission fees to musicians; about 30% went to the government, 20% to 
the racketeers; for racketeering you have to pay everybody. Sure, I can say 
that. I say whatever I like. That's why my jazz club became famous, because I 
was saying everything in Soviet Union despite the fact that I could have 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
"Since last September we have jazz every night instead of just Wednesdays. We 
got to the point where if nobody helps us, at least nobody interferes." 
</P>
<P>
When musicians such as Billy Taylor, Dave Brubeck, Paul Horn or Pat Metheny 
came to the Bluebird and sat in, the Union of Composers wanted to know why 
Tonoyan had not asked permission. "I told them no, in jazz everyone has right 
to play; jam session is not KGB." 
</P>
<P>
Tonoyan's tenacity has paid off. For a year, because there was no budget for 
musicians, he used his own salary of 100 rubles a month ($150) to pay them. "We 
are cheapest jazz club in world; only three rubles admission. There is no 
alcohol -- in Russia some people have problems with drinking -- but we have 
good food, coffee, juices, very inexpensive." 
</P>
<P>
On the first anniversary of the Bluebird's opening, Tonoyan launched a second 
room, Vartan's Jazz, a semi-private club aimed mainly at the foreign community. 
It was here that the last scene was played in the great George Shultz caper. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard he plays tenor sax, so I thought why not invite him? Well, as soon as 
Soviet officials heard of this, they made all the changes in the Bluebird that 
I had been requesting for a year: Lighting, furniture, painting, kitchen -- to 
impress him. He didn't come anyway; but he did play at a private party at 
Vartan's." 
</P>
<P>
And how did the secretary of state sound on tenor sax? 
</P>
<P>
"He played theme only. Our musicians played improvisations." 
</P>
<P>
Since an agreement was made last fall to pay the musicians, they have been 
receiving ("depending on the quality") from 25 to 50 rubles a night. "It's not 
bad, because it's so difficult to find jobs for jazz men who are not invited to 
perform in official concert halls." 
</P>
<P>
One of Tonoyan's problems is defection. The highly regarded avant-garde Ganelin 
Trio emigrated to Israel. Igor Butman, a tenor player whom Grover Washington 
heard at the Bluebird, left for Boston to study at the Berklee College of 
Music; he played on Washington's recent album. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet jazz is improving, but Tonoyan has ambitious plans to upgrade it. "I 
want to persuade more Americans to come over on visit, not just through 
official Gosconcert channels, but just dealing directly with us. This week I go 
to Washington for TV and radio programs. I will talk about my idea of opening a 
private jazz school in Moscow to invite famous musicians to teach there. I am 
trying to find sponsors for this." 
</P>

Despite the red tape, the committees, the maze of paperwork and all the other 
obstacles, he believes that conditions have improved. "The atmosphere for 
culture is cleaner; the air is more fresh. You can see the changes Gorbachev is 
making in Moscow, but in Central Russia it moves more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"It may take two or three decades to accomplish all we want to do, but we are 
on our way."

YELTSIN PUTS JOB ON LINE IN SOVIET ELECTION BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As deputy chairman of the Soviet State Construction Committee, Boris N. Yeltsin 
oversees an army of almost 12 million workers who last year put up about $328 
billion worth of factories, stores, offices, housing and other buildings across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
He has a large paneled office in central Moscow. Special telephone lines 
connect him with the Council of Ministers in the Kremlin and the Communist 
Party's Central Committee headquarters. A black, chauffeur-driven limousine 
that is emblematic of ministerial rank awaits his summons. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Yeltsin has power -- and all its trappings. 
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin, 58, an engineer turned politician, is ready to give up his envied 
executive position, its authority and attendant privileges in order to become a 
member of the Congress of People's Deputies. This is the Soviet Union's newly 
restructured Parliament, which is to be elected March 26 as a fundamental part 
of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"If I am elected a deputy, I cannot remain a minister, and I will resign from 
the government," Yeltsin said last week in an interview. "For me, the choice 
can be only one, because you cannot compare the trust you receive from the 
people to an appointment to the chair of a minister." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision Could Prove Historic 
</P>
<P>
If Yeltsin is correct, if real political power shifts from the black-suited, 
grim-faced apparatchiks of the government and party to the popularly elected 
members of the strengthened national Parliament, his decision to go into 
parliamentary politics could prove historic. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope and believe that this will be an absolutely new body, a legislative 
organ of a completely new type, a body to which everything in the Soviet Union 
is subordinated," Yeltsin said of the Congress of People's Deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"If I thought that it would become, even in the slightest degree, the 
supporting cast (for the party leadership), as the legislature used to be, then 
I would never have run." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's candidacy for the seat that represents Moscow at large demonstrates 
the degree to which this election -- the first to be contested actively since 
the earliest years of the Soviet state -- already has opened up politics to 
opposition figures. And this, in turn, may end the party's long monopoly on 
decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
Although the elections initially attracted five candidates for every seat, few 
officials have placed as much faith as Yeltsin in the new congress, now 
enshrined in the Soviet constitution as the highest body of state power, or in 
the Supreme Soviet, the much-strengthened legislature that the congress will 
elect. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Victories Assured 
</P>
<P>
And while many senior officials are certain to win election to seats reserved 
under the constitution for party representatives, only Yeltsin, of the 100-plus 
members of the Council of Ministers, has put his present job on the line by 
running independently. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, looking beyond the election to the formation of the Supreme Soviet, 
envisions the emergence of a major bloc -- he calls it the "revolutionary left" 
-- within Parliament that "will be progressive, courageous and strong, able to 
conduct the political line that the people want." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly hoping to become its leader, Yeltsin said this bloc should be able to 
win enough support from those "who are progressively inclined but lacking 
enough courage to act" to defeat those placed in the new Parliament to 
represent the bureaucracy's interests. A multiparty system is something that 
might be discussed, he added. 
</P>
<P>
A maverick, Yeltsin broke with the Communist Party's top leadership 18 months 
ago over the scope and pace of reform -- he said it lacked "revolutionary 
thrust" and had grown sluggish -- in a controversy that still echoes loudly and 
has become the basis for his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pace of Reform Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Although still a member of the party's policy-making Central Committee, he is 
strongly critical of the way that perestroika, the reform program instituted by 
Gorbachev over the past four years, is being implemented. He contends that "the 
brakes have been put on, sometimes quite openly," and that as a result 
perestroika is skidding. 
</P>
<P>
"My view is that having resolved the basic political questions, we should begin 
restructuring the party but at the same time focus on the most pressing issue 
-- raising the living standards of the people -- and concentrate all available 
resources on that mission," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I support Mikhail Gorbachev completely on foreign policy and on national 
security, and on domestic policies I support his strategic goals," Yeltsin 
said. "But I differ with him on a number of points on domestic issues on what 
our tactics should be. This is natural, I think, because people do differ on 
how goals should be reached. To criticize does not mean to oppose." 
</P>
<P>
But such criticism -- as well as his own hard-driving management style -- led 
to Yeltsin's removal in November, 1987, as the party leader in Moscow and later 
as a non-voting member of the Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
He was criticized by Gorbachev as "politically immature, extremely confused and 
contradictory" and denounced by local officials for poor management of the 
capital. When he was rebuffed last summer at a special party conference where 
he sought "rehabilitation," his political career appeared to many to be 
finished, except for his job as deputy chairman of the State Construction 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin, a tall, broad-shouldered man with a mane of thick white hair and 
strong blue eyes, has an enormous following, particularly for his plain-spoken 
style and populist politics. 
</P>
<P>
After the party conference, T-shirts quickly appeared saying "Fight, Boris!" 
along with buttons urging "You tell 'em, Yeltsin." Although he was virtually 
banned from the central Soviet press as too pugnacious, his interviews with 
local newspapers were avidly read. 
</P>
<P>
His celebrated public feud with Yegor K. Ligachev, a senior Politburo member 
who has become the voice of conservatism within the Soviet leadership, has 
probably added to Yeltsin's popularity. Despite the tradition of not discussing 
such party business openly, he continues to call for Ligachev's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Famous Phenomenon 
</P>
<P>
In a country where political leaders often seem unapproachable, where senior 
officials are unreachable and where the bureaucrats are simply unreasonable, 
Yeltsin has been a phenomenon. As party leader for a decade in his native 
Sverdlovsk, a major industrial center in the Ural Mountains, and then in Moscow 
from 1985 to 1987, he rode buses, walked through factories and stood in the 
food lines. He also attacked bureaucrats, abolished many of their privileges 
and met regularly with thousands of people in marathon, no-questions-barred 
sessions for which he became famous. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opponent Well-Organized 
</P>
<P>
So when campaigning started in late December for the parliamentary elections, 
Yeltsin was nominated in more than 200 constituencies nationwide, and he 
eventually chose the citywide Moscow constituency for the unique platform he 
would have in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
His opponent, Yevgeny Brakov, 51, is director of Moscow's giant ZIL automotive 
plant, and has a well-organized, well-financed team of campaign workers. Brakov 
is a mainstream supporter of Gorbachev, and he has the Moscow party 
organization behind him.

BOMBING SHATTERS NORMAL ROUTINE MAINTAINED BY FAMILY AFTER FUROR

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Will and Sharon Rogerses' lives were turned traumatically upside down last 
July, when the U.S. Navy ship under his command mistook an Iranian passenger 
airliner for a hostile warplane and shot it down over the Persian Gulf, they 
did their best to disguise it. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, captain of the guided missile cruiser Vincennes, returned to his home 
port of San Diego last October and offered dockside remarks about the July 
shooting that killed 290 people. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the loss of innocent lives in any combat engagement is a tragedy . . 
. but my absolute responsibility was for the safety of my ship and my crew," 
Rogers told a reporter for a radio station popular in San Diego's immigrant 
Iranian community. "It does not mean that we regret it any less and certainly 
we never considered the Iranians an enemy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Never Spoke About Incident 
</P>
<P>
Rogers then left with his wife on his arm for their home in the La Jolla area 
of northern San Diego County. They have spoken nary a word about the incident 
since, even among close friends. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the couple had not been in the news again until Friday -- when Sharon 
Rogers escaped injury after jumping clear of her Toyota van moments before it 
was destroyed by fire after a bomb went off. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers had returned to a normal, in-port regimen, continuing to command his 
ship, oversee routine maintenance tasks in dock and participating in short 
training exercises off the coast of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
At home -- in a favorite neighborhood where they had lived once before -- 
Rogers and his wife have been careful not to mix Navy with neighborliness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Watched Out for Wife 
</P>
<P>
"They're good people. Good people," said George Petrou, who lives directly 
across from the Rogerses' home and who characterized himself and his wife as 
perhaps their closest friends on the block. The Rogerses, he said, "never talk 
shop." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Mary, remembered how neighbors would watch out for Sharon Rogers' 
welfare in the wake of the news last July that the Vincennes had knocked a 
passenger airliner out of the sky, because of fear that someone might retaliate 
against the ship captain's wife. 
</P>
<P>
"We watched her every single day," Mary Petrou said, recalling how she would 
even set the alarm on her son's clock to make sure he was awake to watch her 
leave the home on her way to work. 
</P>
<P>
The Petrous and other neighbors said Friday there was never any spoken concern 
about threats against the couple -- and certainly no signs of danger. 
</P>
<P>
If Will Rogers and his wife were worried about their safety, it didn't show. 
What about the red-white-and-blue sign in their front yard, advertising that 
the home was somehow watched by a private security service? Heck, said one 
neighbor, we've all got those signs. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, this was not a private neighborhood behind walls, but simply a quiet 
cul-de-sac a block away from one of San Diego's most popular shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
And so it was that the Rogerses had apparently made the transition from 
controversial headlines to suburban regimen, simply avoiding any discussions 
about the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked for happiness, not for business," Petrou said. "But he is a tough 
guy, a good soldier." 
</P>
<P>
Petrou watched Friday morning as the couple left their home -- Rogers in his 
uniform, behind the wheel of a blue Mercedes-Benz sports coupe, and Sharon 
Rogers in her Toyota van, headed to her class of fourth-graders at the private 
La Jolla Country Day School not far away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Laughing, Smiling' 
</P>
<P>
"I gave them some strawberries about 7," Petrou said. "When they left, about 
7:30, they were laughing and smiling, and they drove down the street together." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon only got a few blocks from home when the explosion occurred; her husband 
did not learn of the bombing until he arrived at the 32nd Street Naval Station, 
where his ship is docked. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy spokesman, Chief Craig Huebler, said Rogers had been busy readying his 
ship for redeployment -- although a specific assignment and departure date has 
not yet been announced. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything a normal commanding officer would be doing for his ship, Capt. 
Rogers was doing," Huebler said. "He's been taking care of all the overhaul and 
repair items. Whatever. It's a wide range of tasks, basically the general shore 
operation of the ship." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, while admitting grief over the July 3 downing of the Iranian airliner, 
nonetheless did not apologize for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
As he put it at the time: "Given the fact that the airliner made no indication 
that it was not a hostile threat, we had no other choice. So our grief and our 
despair over that is tempered by the knowledge that we did what we had to do 
when we had to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers recalled how the crucial decisions were made in the 189-second period 
during which the Vincennes was engaged in a battle with seven Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard patrol boats that had been firing on an American 
helicopter. The Vincennes sank two of the gunboats and damaged a third. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crucial Errors 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon concluded that the crew of the ship made crucial errors that led 
to the decision to shoot down the airliner, but that it could not be held 
responsible because Iran's behavior in the incident was "unconscionable." The 
plane, which took off from a joint civilian-military airfield in Bandar Abbas 
and began to cross the Persian Gulf, failed to respond to 12 radioed warnings 
from the Vincennes, the Pentagon report noted. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of Navy investigators exonerated Rogers but recommended a letter of 
censure for Lt. Cmdr. Scott E. Lustig, the officer who was coordinating the 
ship's anti-aircraft systems at the time of the incident. That recommendation 
was overruled by then-Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and Adm. William J. 
Crowe Jr., who decided to take no action against Lustig or anyone else on board 
the ship.

PACIFIC 10 TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
BRUINS FINALLY PULL AWAY IN SECOND HALF; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA TURNS UP THE PRESSURE, RUNS PAST WASHINGTON, 64-54 
</P>

<P>
According to Coach Jim Harrick, the UCLA basketball team ran through a series 
of great practices this week in preparation for the Pacific 10 Conference 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Practice, though, did not make perfect Friday night at the Forum, where the 
Bruins struggled through all but the last 10 minutes of a 64-54 victory over 
Washington in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Practice made mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
But that was enough on a night when Don MacLean scored 18 points to become the 
Pac-10's all-time leading freshman scorer and Pooh Richardson contributed 13 
points and nine assists while limiting Eldridge Recasner, Washington's leading 
scorer, to six points. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really hard for us to play because of the delay style they used," said 
Harrick, whose team finally unleashed its running game and shook the Huskies 
with a 12-0 run that gave the Bruins a 46-36 lead with 5 minutes 37 seconds 
left. "We weren't patient. 
</P>
<P>
"But our pressure finally took them out of what they wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved UCLA's record to 20-8 and advanced the Bruins into today's 
semifinals, where they will meet 12th-ranked Stanford (25-5) in a 3 p.m. game 
that will be televised by Channel 2. 
</P>
<P>
A Stanford victory would end generations of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford, a 66-61 winner over USC Friday night, has lost 40 consecutive games 
to UCLA in Los Angeles, last beating the Bruins here at the UCLA Men's Gym, 
73-71, on Jan. 5, 1952, in John Wooden's fourth season. 
</P>
<P>
How long ago was that? 
</P>
<P>
At that time, reporters referred to Wooden as Johnny. 
</P>
<P>
The streak includes 24 Bruin victories at Pauley Pavilion, the most recent a 
74-70 decision last Dec. 23 in which MacLean had 26 points and 12 rebounds and 
Richardson had 16 points and 10 assists. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, on a day when Richardson and Trevor Wilson spent much of the 
first half on the bench because of foul trouble and the Bruins were whistled 
for a season-high 31 fouls, Stanford made 57.1% of its shots and defeated the 
Bruins, 84-75, at Maples Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Including that game, which came two days after a 74-65 Cardinal loss at 
California, Stanford has won 12 of 13 games. The Cardinal has won 10 straight 
since a 72-52 loss to Arizona Jan. 29 at Tucson, its longest winning streak in 
27 years. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, the Cardinal is expected to be included in the draw for the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament for the first time since 1942, when 
Stanford, then known as the Indians, won the NCAA championship in its only 
appearance in the tournament, which began in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, meanwhile, will be back home in Seattle Sunday, apparently relieved 
that its season is over. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies (12-16) lost nine games by 14 or more points, and the relationship 
between Coach Andy Russo and his players was such that Recasner reportedly told 
Russo at a team meeting in December: "No one really respects you, so we don't 
want to win for you." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA twice rolled over the Huskies, romping at Seattle in January, 93-74, and 
then winning even more easily two weeks ago at Pauley Pavilion, 101-78. 
</P>
<P>
This time, though, both teams started cold. 
</P>
<P>
Washington led at halftime, 25-23, at one point holding the Bruins without a 
field goal for almost 6 1/2 minutes in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies, though, never got too far ahead because they went more than five 
minutes without a field goal at about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the half, forward Mark West scored eight straight points during 
a 12-3 run by Washington that took the Huskies from a 13-9 deficit to a 21-16 
lead in a five-minute span. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, which made only 39.1% of its shots in the half, caught up with a 7-2 run 
of its own, but Jeff Sanor made two free throws with 1 minute 20 seconds left 
to give the Huskies a 25-23 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Washington outrebounded the Bruins, 16-8, in the first 20 minutes and also made 
50% of its shots, but committed 10 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
West led the Huskies with eight first-half points and Dion Brown, a sophomore 
forward from Crenshaw High, scored seven. 
</P>
<P>
Center Kevin Walker led UCLA with seven points. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Don MacLean has scored 524 points in 28 games. Stanford's Todd Lichti 
scored 516 in 32 games as a freshman in the 1985-86 season. . . . UCLA's Pooh 
Richardson, who had nine assists, needs two to surpass Russell Brown, formerly 
of Arizona, and become the Pacific 10 Conference's all-time assist leader. . . 
. Lichti scored 18 points in each of Stanford's two games against UCLA this 
season, but made only 13 of 33 shots. . . . Kevin Williams, a reserve guard for 
UCLA who had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee two weeks ago, is probably 
out for the season, Coach Jim Harrick said. . . . UCLA's Trevor Wilson, who 
scored 16 points, missed all eight of his free throws.

NEW MARINER MANAGER IMPRESSING PLAYERS;

Jim Lefebvre calls them his Elmer Gantry speeches: A little fire and brimstone 
to start each spring morning. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the new manager of the Seattle Mariners borrows from Bull Halsey or 
Vince Lombardi or Sadaharu Oh. Sometimes he quotes from the Bible or the 
philosophy of Zen. Always, though, he mixes in thoughts and expressions from 
his own fertile and hyper mind. 
</P>
<P>
How hyper? 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy can sit down to talk about hitting for an hour and break into a sweat 
because he gets so excited," his twin brother, Tip, the pitching coach at UCLA, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always been hyper. We get together for a family dinner and he never stops 
looking at his watch. He's always looking for a vase or piece of furniture to 
rearrange." 
</P>
<P>
Lefebvre, a graduate of Inglewood's Morningside High School and a former Dodger 
infielder, now hopes to rearrange the future of an organization that has 
employed nine managers in 12 years and never reached .500. 
</P>
<P>
The Walter Mitty dream that came alive for the late Danny Kaye, one of the 
team's original owners, has become a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Players can't wait to flee the dimensional constraints of the cold, gray 
Kingdome and a pattern of economic restraints by management. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Moore, the Mariners' best right-handed pitcher, signed with the Oakland 
Athletics as a free agent in November. Mark Langston, their best left-handed 
pitcher, is expected to leave as a free agent after the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
Is it any wonder that the 46-year-old Lefebvre, generally considered baseball's 
most promising new manager since Bobby Valentine took the Texas Rangers' reins, 
feels the need to work on his players' psyches? 
</P>
<P>
He arrives at Tempe Stadium at 7:30 each morning to plot the day's activities. 
Two hours later, he is delivering a Gantry-type sermon to the players, 
preaching positives. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel my strength is in the areas of teaching and motivation," Lefebvre said. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel my strength is that I get people to commit themselves, but I also 
realize that positive thinking has no value unless it's backed up by substance, 
by solid fundamentals, and that's what we're stressing." 
</P>
<P>
A student of great leaders, Lefebvre honed his motivational skills during a 
long friendship with Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
That relationship ended bitterly, though, in a 1980 shouting match and 
punch-out. 
</P>
<P>
The two haven't spoken since, but Lefebvre still says he carries "a lot of 
Tommy Lasorda in me." 
</P>
<P>
Said Mike Paul, who was a coach with Lefebvre on Tony LaRussa's Oakland staff 
last year and is now the Seattle pitching coach: 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy picks everybody up. In Oakland he would even slap the batboys on the 
back to make sure they were psyched. 'Big game tonight,' he'd say. 'Gotta be 
ready.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners seem impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"He's talked to me more in a few weeks than (former manager) Dick Williams did 
in two years," relief pitcher Jerry Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Said outfielder Jay Buhner, citing Lefebvre's drive and intensity: 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like getting an instant confidence boost. It's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Acquired from the New York Yankees last summer, Buhner hit .306 in August and 
.136 in September. 
</P>
<P>
He was summoned to Seattle last winter and spent a week getting one-on-one 
hitting instruction from Lefebvre, who was there on a speaking tour, though he 
lives in Scottsdale, Ariz., with wife Ruth and their three children: Briana, 4; 
Bryce, 2, and Brittany, 4 months. 
</P>
<P>
"If Jimmy doesn't leave you with the feeling you can hit .400, I don't know who 
could," Buhner said. 
</P>
<P>
In this difficult attempt to save the Mariners from another shipwreck, Lefebvre 
can draw on the experiences of a varied career. 
</P>
<P>
He spent eight years as the Dodgers' second baseman, compiled a .251 average, 
helped form an all-switch-hitting infield with Wes Parker, Maury Wills and Jim 
Gilliam, won the National League's rookie-of-the-year award in 1965 and played 
in two World Series and an All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to play four more years in Japan, where he was exposed to Zen and a 
more demanding work ethic than even his own and became only the second American 
-- Johnny Logan was the other -- to play on a World Series winner and champion 
of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to manage the Dodgers' Pioneer League team in 1977, coached under 
Lasorda for two years, spent two more on the coaching staff of the San 
Francisco Giants, served two years as personnel director of the Giants, managed 
the Giants' triple-A team in Phoenix for two years, then joined the A's as 
LaRussa's third base coach and batting instructor. 
</P>
<P>
Lefebvre is now in the 28th year of his professional odyssey. He is most often 
applauded for his skill in coaching hitters and motivating people -- of all 
ages. As co-founder of Athletes for Youth, an anti-drug program, he has been 
honored at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
How unfortunate, it seems, that in his hometown of Los Angeles he may be best 
remembered for the manner in which his relationship with Lasorda ended. 
</P>
<P>
Neither will now discuss the incident, but according to reports and interviews 
at the time, it stemmed from events during the 1979 season, after which 
Lefebvre was replaced as Dodger batting coach by Manny Mota. 
</P>
<P>
Lefebvre later said that Lasorda -- envious, perhaps -- was undermining his 
work with the hitters. Lasorda claimed that Lefebvre went over his head, to 
then-Vice President Al Campanis, in an attempt to get a center-field camera to 
film the hitters. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Tommy I could never get in to talk to him about it because his office 
was always filled with Hollywood types," Lefebvre said in the spring of 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The punch that ended the relationship was thrown on Feb. 17 of that year in a 
KNBC studio in Burbank, where they were guests on the same show. The tapings 
were arranged for different times so that they wouldn't encounter each other, 
but they inadvertently met on an empty sound stage. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda lashed at Lefebvre verbally, according to Lefebvre. 
</P>
<P>
"He used four-letter words you wouldn't believe," Lefebvre said in a subsequent 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'Tommy, that's the last time you can say those things to me. I'm 
not employed by you anymore.' I started to walk away and he took off his coat 
and pulled his arm back and I decked him. I think I split his lip. There was a 
lot of blood. He said he wanted to keep on going, but someone was holding him 
back. The only regret I had then was that I knew I'd never be able to wear a 
Dodger uniform again." 
</P>
<P>
In an ensuing interview with the Sporting News, Lasorda said he was hit with a 
sucker punch, prompting Lefebvre to say, "He's right. It was the sucker who got 
punched." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the bleachers at Tempe Stadium the other day, Lefebvre said it was a 
bitter way to end a friendship. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not going to let one moment spoil what I think about him," he added. 
"I had problems with Tommy, but I also respect him." 
</P>
<P>
Lefebvre cited Lasorda's energy, his ability to motivate players to play above 
their abilities and his talent for getting players to relax. 
</P>
<P>
"He's locked into Dodger blue, but he could win anywhere," Lefebvre said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Lasorda, from Vero Beach: "Just write that I wish him well and think he'll 
do fine. He's a hard worker, and that's the main thing." 
</P>
<P>
Lefebvre attributes his work ethic to his father, Ben, a former baseball coach 
at Pepperdine who is also a respected batting instructor and collaborated with 
Jim on an acclaimed textbook, "The Making of a Hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Ben and Virginia Lefebvre ran a summer baseball school on Catalina when Jim, 
Tip and younger brother Gil, now a cross-country coach at Belmont High, were 
growing up. Lefebvre remembers the lessons and lectures there, and the intense 
games the brothers played in the back yard of their small Hawthorne area farm. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't begin to count the number of pitches Dad threw to us, but it was 
the long talks that really made an impact," Lefebvre said, adding that his 
father had an early version of Bobby McFerrin's philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Why worry?' he'd say. 'When you're worrying, you can't be successful, you 
can't be winning. Don't clutter your brain with negative thinking.' 
</P>
<P>
"He'd always remind us that you have to be consistent, that you have to grind 
it out daily to be a success." 
</P>
<P>
Much later, in Japan, the great hitter Oh taught him the value of Zen, which 
extended his father's lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people look on Zen as a religion, but it's more a philosophy, a concept 
of concentration that frees the mind," said Lefebvre, who explained the four 
stages of awareness and how Zen allows an athlete to go beyond his ability. 
</P>
<P>
"Skill is an act of will," he said. "You can do anything you set your mind to." 
</P>
<P>
Lefebvre also said that the Japanese emphasis on detail and team made an 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese say that the nail that sticks up will be hammered down," he said. 
"And that's what they do. If you get too big, if you place yourself ahead of 
the team, they put you in front of a wall and hammer grounders at you." 
</P>
<P>
When excited, when on a roll, Lefebvre talks in machine-gun bursts, passionate 
about his subject, his job, his sport. He is a baseball lifer, he said, and 
wants people around him who share his attachment to the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to be the best I could be, no matter what job I was doing," he 
said. "I'm sure every player thinks about managing, but it was never an 
obsession. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of seeped into my blood, and I always felt that in time the right 
opportunity would come." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle? The right opportunity? 
</P>
<P>
He was also interviewed by the Angels and Chicago White Sox, but Lefebvre said 
he began to feel that Seattle was the best situation of all. Only part of it 
was the offer of two years and an option on a third, as well as the chance to 
select his own coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"Some good baseball people tried to talk me out of it," he said. "They said it 
was a mess, a bad organization, a losing environment. But wasn't that what they 
said when Vince Lombardi went into Green Bay? 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, Tony LaRussa said to me, 'How many times do you get this opportunity?' 
And the more I looked at the opportunity, the more I liked it. 
</P>
<P>
"How often do you get to take a club that has never won, to start at the bottom 
and work your way up? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tremendous challenge and I want the players to understand just what the 
possibilities are, that we can do some things to really motivate and lift a 
town that is dying for it to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Lefebvre paused, gathering his thoughts as if this were a speech to his team. 
He recalled how Admiral William F. (Bull) Halsey once said, "There are no great 
men, only great challenges that ordinary men are forced by circumstances to 
meet." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lefebvre: "Halsey played for bigger stakes but it's the same at any level. 
It's people caring and working hard. It's people accepting opportunities and 
challenges, and I've always been that kind of person." 
</P>
<P>
So, he is working on the Mariners' psyches, dealing in philosophies and 
platitudes, asking only that the players listen with open minds and offering 
assurance that they will never hear a negative from him. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned from Chuck Knox that you never coach caution into your players," he 
said. "Be aggressive and keep it simple because simplicity breeds security and 
security breeds confidence. It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
Not quite. Lefebvre knows that when the rhetoric stops he will be judged 
strictly on games won and lost. He accepts that and isn't asking for time. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no timetable, no three-year plan," he said. "If I put three years on 
it, people will say, 'Well, he's got two years to coast.' We're going after it 
starting right now." 
</P>
<P>
In the process, Lefebvre said, he hopes to show the same professionalism as 
LaRussa, the same ability to let his players play and coaches coach as Walter 
Alston. 
</P>
<P>
He is more hyper than either, though. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple years ago . . . I started to worry about myself and wondered if I was 
too hyper, too intense," Lefebvre said. 
</P>
<P>
"I even started to tone it down, but then I said, 'Hey, this isn't me. I don't 
want to be something I'm not.' I even talked to Tony (LaRussa) about it and he 
said, 'I want you to be what you want to be. I want you to be aggressive and 
enthusiastic.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners seem impressed. Pitcher Bill Swift wondered, however, if the hyper 
Lefebvre has enough hype to cover the 45 days of spring training with a 
different daily message. It might be too much for Gantry, but Lefebvre laughed 
and said, "No problem. I've got 60 ready."

FRANCIS SUGGESTS RANDOM, UNANNOUNCED DRUG TESTS

Johnson's coach, Charlie Francis, ended 29 hours of testimony Friday before the 
Canadian government's commission of inquiry into drug use by athletes with a 
suggestion that only random, unannounced testing during training periods will 
eliminate anabolic steroids and other banned substances from track and field. 
</P>
<P>
In questioning Francis, the commission's chairman, Ontario associate chief 
justice Charles L. Dubin, theorized that Canada's system of federally funding 
athletes is at the root of the problem. Many Canadian athletes receive monthly 
payments, the amount increasing in accordance with their international 
rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Francis, who competed as a sprinter for Canada in the 1972 Olympic Games, 
disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Athletes today are in the same position I was," he said. "There was no funding 
in my day. Yet, I chose to use steroids (in 1973) because I wanted to compete. 
You have to consider the fact that athletes are very highly motivated 
individuals." 
</P>
<P>
When Dubin said that cheating in sports leads to cheating later in life in 
other endeavors, Francis defended athletes and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want to be in this situation," he said. "It's a dilemma created by 
the structure of the sport rather than the athletes and coaches who are in it. 
They want to compete on a level playing field, but it's not possible to do that 
without drugs at this time. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this sport, and I would love to see it cleaned up." RANDY HARVEY

WOMEN'S TENNIS TOURNAMENT AT INDIAN WELLS; 
</P>
<P>
AUSTRALIA'S BYRNE UPSETS SHRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

INDIAN WELLS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only two seeded players have made it to the semifinals of the $250,000 Virginia 
Slims tournament at Hyatt Grand Champions, and one of them, No. 4 Manuela 
Maleeva, had to stagger there on a twisted left ankle that could force her to 
default. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, sympathy for the fallen -- who now include Pam Shriver -- was in short 
supply. Helena Sukova, the highest-seeded player still around at No. 2, said, 
well, that's the way it goes sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really care much," she said. "It's bad luck for them." 
</P>
<P>
And so, after five days, it's anybody's tournament. After Friday, anybody's but 
Shriver's. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament's third-seeded player was defeated by Jenny Byrne, 6-2, 3-6, 
6-2, which meant that Shriver was the last seeded player to lose, a record that 
lasted about 30 minutes, until sixth-seeded Catarina Lindqvist lost to Maleeva, 
6-3, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver, who was playing her second singles match since the Australian Open, 
fell victim to a hectic 2 1/2 days of tennis that included 11 sets, 108 games, 
and two tiebreakers in four matches, counting doubles. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was a pitcher, I would have asked my manager for three or four days off," 
Shriver said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, she can take off. 
</P>
<P>
In something of a surprise, Byrne, 20, an Australian from Perth, has a berth in 
the today's semifinals with Hana Mandlikova, who defeated Isabelle Demongeot, 
6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Demongeot, the 22-year-old from France, said that Mandlikova has benefited from 
her six-month layoff. 
</P>
<P>
"She is playing the same, but I think she is much better in her head," 
Demongeot said. 
</P>
<P>
Mandlikova is a Czech-born Australian citizen who at one time was not warmly 
welcomed by the Aussie women players. That problem has long since blown over, 
said Byrne, who jokingly suggested that they may share an Australian meat pie 
as a symbol of peace after they walk onto the court. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne, a 5-foot 4-inch speedster, did not get into the 28-player main draw 
until she had won three matches in qualifying. Ranked No. 64 in the world, 
Byrne should have been a clear underdog against the No. 6-ranked Shriver, but 
not this time. 
</P>
<P>
Some quick facts about Jenny Byrne: 
</P>
<P>
 -- She scored her lone tournament victory in 1984 in Wyong on the Australian 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two of her three sisters competed in the World Games in rhythmic 
gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Her golden retriever is named Boris. 
</P>
<P>
Boris? 
</P>
<P>
"I hope (Boris Becker) doesn't mind, it looks a bit like him," Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
Going into her match with Shriver, Byrne was brimming with confidence. She said 
later that she knew she could win. And Byrne did it under the pressure Shriver 
always bring to a match. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 feet, Shriver always presents a good target as she charges the net, yet 
Byrne displayed an uncanny ability to hit winning passing shots, especially 
from her backhand. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne led, 4-2, in the third set when a weary Shriver tried to come back on her 
serve, but couldn't. She double-faulted to 15-15 and again at break point. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne, who had serious service problems of her own in the second set, hung 
tough to serve out the match after Shriver had staved off one match point. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't have the same energy level," said Shriver, who admitted the heat 
on Stadium Court had worn her down. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for a roof there for a while," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although her victory was her biggest this year, Byrne has been knocking on the 
door to a higher level of tennis. At Brisbane, she won two matches in 
qualifying and reached the semifinals before losing to Brenda Schultz. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver said the book on Byrne has been about a classic underachiever, but that 
may be undergoing a rewrite. Too heavy? Too unmotivated? Byrne is playing too 
well for such characterizations. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that she will go out and play a great match with Hana," said Shriver, 
who said any one of the semifinalists has an outside chance of winning. 
</P>
<P>
"Byrne is probably the outsidest of them all," Shriver said. 
</P>
<P>
The relentless Mandlikova's victory over Demongeot enabled her to reach the 
semifinals for the second consecutive week. The difference is that instead of 
playing Steffi Graf, as she did last week in San Antonio, she meets Byrne. 
</P>
<P>
Mandlikova's reaction? 
</P>
<P>
"Jenny is a nice girl," she said. 
</P>
<P>
No controversy here. There are also no seeded players left in Mandlikova's top 
half of the draw, a fact for which she saw no reason to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
"As I said at the beginning of the tournament, it's not important who is in the 
draw, just to be happy," she said. "Don't worry, be happy." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Maleeva is too busy worrying to be happy. She turned her 
ankle at 5-1 in the first set, but chose to continue and actually played better 
in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
Maleeva hopes that, after treatment, her ankle will improve. She will test it 
today and then decide if she is fit enough to play Sukova. 
</P>
<P>
No one else, though, is as fit as Sukova, who hasn't dropped a set in her two 
matches. Against Jana Novotna, her doubles partner, Sukova was forced to go to 
a second-set tiebreaker before pulling out a 6-1, 7-6 (7-4) victory. 
</P>
<P>
Sukova is not about to put any pressure on herself at this stage of the 
tournament. Like Mandlikova, she just wants to feel good about herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel all right," Sukova said. "If I win, it's great. If I don't, I get more 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
It's doubtful whether a completely fit Maleeva could beat Sukova, but a 
slightly hobbled one certainly has her work cut out for her.

GOLF ROUNDUP;

<P>
CALCAVECCHIA HAS 69 FOR A SHARE OF LEAD

<P>
Mark Calcavecchia, warming up along with the temperature, shot a two-under-par 
69 Friday to move into a three-way tie for the lead in the $800,000 Nestle 
Invitational golf tournament at Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia, a two-time winner this season, finished two rounds over the Bay 
Hill Club course with a three-under-par 139. He was tied with first 
round-leader Loren Roberts, who shot a 73, and Davis Love III, who had the 
day's best round, a 67. 
</P>
<P>
It was 20 degrees warmer than on Thursday, but a howling wind still made the 
conditions difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Pohl, Tom Kite and Larry Rinker were tied at 140, one stroke back. Rinker 
shot a 68 and Kite had a 72. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Mize, with a 71, and Fred Couples were tied at 141. Couples shot a 69 
that included a 30 on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
Masters champion Sandy Lyle was disqualified. Lyle, 11-over par for the 
tournament, shot into the water on the 18th and walked off the course without 
completing the hole. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Nichols, trying for his first victory on the PGA Seniors Tour, shot a 
10-under-par 62 to take the first-round lead in the $300,000 Arizona tournament 
at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best competitive-round score I've ever had," the 52-year-old Nichols 
said. "I shot a 61 once but it was not in competition." 
</P>
<P>
Al Geiberger, the defending champion, was second with a 65 on the new 
6,617-yard Pointe Golf Course. Harold Henning, Miller Barber, Tommy Aaron and 
Dick Rhyan shot 66s. 
</P>
<P>
Briton Tony Charnley, who has yet to win in 14 years on the PGA European Tour, 
shot a three-under-par 69 for a 136 total and a three-shot lead after two 
rounds of the $100,000 Baleares Open at Palma de Majorca in the Balearic 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Severiano Ballesteros of Spain birdied two of the final four 
holes and barely made the cut at 145.

Dan Petry stepped inside to escape the blistering sun, wiped some sweat from 
his brow and cast a longing eye toward the cold soft drink Kirk McCaskill was 
nursing by his locker stall. 
</P>
<P>
"It'd sure be nice to have one of those root beers," Petry told McCaskill. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill waved him off, dangling the can in front of Petry. 
</P>
<P>
"This is only for a bad outing, Dan," he said. "This is consoling stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Friday afternoon, Petry followed McCaskill to the pitcher's mound for the 
Angels, but only chronologically. McCaskill surrendered four runs on four hits 
and two walks in three innings before retiring to the comfort of a solitary 
root beer. 
</P>
<P>
Petry, in his first appearance of the spring, allowed only one run and one hit 
in three innings. 
</P>
<P>
It was a good outing, and a painless outing, which was major news as far as 
Petry is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
He was plagued with back and ankle ailments through last season, and Petry had 
begun this spring with a stiff right shoulder. The official diagnosis was a 
strain of the posterior rotator cuff, which sounds like the beginning of 
something scary, and Petry was advised to delay his first outing for five days. 
</P>
<P>
Tentatively, he was sent to the mound against the Cleveland Indians at Hi 
Corbett Field. Not so tentatively, he struck out two of the first three hitters 
he faced, allowed a run on a single, two stolen bases and a sacrifice fly, and 
then retired the last six batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
That one run resulted in Petry being charged with the loss -- typical Petry, 
loser of two 1-0 games in 1988 -- as the Indians went on to defeat the Angels, 
8-4. 
</P>
<P>
But Petry didn't really mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are a little better results than my first five outings last spring," 
said Petry, whose 1988 Angel camp was marred by a herniated disk. "I had a 
19.00 ERA or something. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . For the first time out, this was pretty good for me. I don't think 
you're ever happy. There are still some bugs to work out, but that's what 
spring training is for, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Petry said he had no trouble with the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it'll be fine, aside from a little stiffness tomorrow," he said. "It's 
not going to hurt, because it's not hurt. It's just a little tired, that's what 
it felt like. Or like a knot. The trainers can't find one, but it feels like a 
knot back there." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader called Petry's outing "the only real plus of the day" 
but cut his superlatives short, pending Petry's recovery from the three-inning 
stint. 
</P>
<P>
"This was encouraging," Rader said. "But at the same time, the problem will 
only be rectified if he can crank it up the next time out." 
</P>
<P>
Petry is scheduled to pitch again Tuesday. He said he plans on keeping the 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Don Baylor and Reggie Jackson, Angel designated hitters of yesteryear, are 
reportedly among the candidates Angel Vice President Mike Port is considering 
to fill the club's newly created role of assistant general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Port and Baylor discussed the position last winter, but Baylor, holding out 
hope of catching on and playing with another team this season, said he wasn't 
interested. The Angels, however, apparently still are and have asked Bob 
Watson, assistant general manager of the Houston Astros, to ask Baylor, a 
friend, if he might reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, in Phoenix as a spring instructor with the Oakland Athletics, says he 
has also discussed the position with Port. Jackson owns four car dealerships 
and plans to market a brand of car wax, but says he would push those to the 
back burner if the job were offered. 
</P>
<P>
"For an assistant general manager job, I might have to put some things aside," 
Jackson told reporters. "That would be a plum." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he expected to talk to Port "probably this weekend," after Port 
and owner Gene Autry return from the baseball owners meetings in Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla.

DEVEREAUX, MORGAN WATCH AS ORIOLES WIN, 3-0

<P>
Whatever interest the Baltimore Orioles may have in Dodger outfielder Mike 
Devereaux, it was well concealed by both teams Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Devereaux made the three-hour bus trip here from Vero Beach, then spent the 
entire game on the bench during the Dodgers' 3-0 exhibition loss to the 
Orioles. So much for showcasing. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say anything unless it happens, and all I know is I didn't play 
today," said a slightly bewildered Devereaux, who has been hearing rumors of a 
deal with the Orioles for months. 
</P>
<P>
At first, he thought he was headed for Baltimore during trade talks for Eddie 
Murray. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in Puerto Rico playing, I was walking to the plate when they 
announced in the stadium that I had been traded," Devereaux said. "Then when I 
went home, I heard the same thing on TV." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, however, the Dodgers packaged Ken Howell, Brian Holton and minor 
league shortstop Juan Bell for Murray. 
</P>
<P>
But the trade rumors revived this spring, with Devereaux headed to the Orioles 
for pitcher Mike Morgan, the one-time teen-age phenom -- Charlie Finley signed 
him to a big league contract a week after his high school graduation -- who has 
played for five big league teams. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Dodger Executive Vice President Fred Claire sat in the rain 
watching Morgan pitch two innings of a B game at Port St. Lucie. But while 
everything seemed to indicate that a trade is imminent, it hasn't happened yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to know," Devereaux said. "It's kind of hard when it's always in your 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
It's also kind of funny. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day when I come to the clubhouse, guys say to me, 'You're still here?' " 
Devereaux said. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin Stubbs, whose name also has popped up frequently in trade rumors, saw 
a possible omen in Devereaux's inaction Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually they don't play a guy against the team he's going to be traded to," 
Stubbs said. "Hey, I was just happy to get the at-bats." 
</P>
<P>
Stubbs played right field and first base and had two of the Dodgers' six hits, 
a double and single. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, Morgan did not pitch, either. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Valenzuela was all smiles when he came off the field after his second 
spring start, in which he went three innings and gave up a run on three hits 
and three walks. 
</P>
<P>
"He was staying on top of the ball much better," said catcher Rick Dempsey, 
alluding to the way Valenzuela was wild high in his first start, when he walked 
four. "He was just off the corners, but he was keeping it down. He threw some 
real good screwballs and his fastball was much better." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tom Lasorda also took a positive line in assessing Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
"All I want him to say to me is that he isn't hurting," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
"If he tells me his arm isn't hurt, that's what I'm happy about." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Murray returned to the place where he had trained for the last 12 years, 
but he was hardly sentimental about the journey. 
</P>
<P>
"Was it hard?" said the longtime Oriole. "Just people here to say hi to, that's 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Murray did, however, treat his teammates to a giant order of catfish 
sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
"Did Frank (Robinson, the Oriole manager) say he missed you?" Lasorda 
mischievously called out to Murray. 
</P>
<P>
Murray rolled his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think those words came out of his mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Murray made no secret of his wish to leave Baltimore last winter, which is why 
he thought someone was joking when the Orioles announced plans to retire his 
number. 
</P>
<P>
And what did he think of the gesture, once he learned it was on the level? 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that I don't think about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Mariano Duncan, the first batter in the game, was struck on the 
left hand with a pitch by Baltimore pitcher Curt Schilling and left the game. 
The Dodgers planned to take X-rays today in Vero Beach, but for the time being 
they are calling the injury a bruise. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's OK," said Duncan, fighting to win a utility position on the team. 
"I can feel my fingers and close my hand."

HAZZARD AND UCLA AGREE TO SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walt Hazzard, former UCLA basketball coach, has reached an agreement with the 
school over settlement of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
Hazzard, who was fired by the Bruins in March, 1988, after four years as coach, 
had two years left on the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Hazzard will work as a development officer at UCLA under the supervision of 
Vice Chancellor Winston Doby. He will be involved in the university's Young 
Black Scholars Program, which helps academically gifted high school students, 
and with a special development program on the elementary school level. 
</P>
<P>
Hazzard was in Maryland Friday and unavailable for comment but he released a 
statement that said: 
</P>
<P>
"I believe America's greatest natural resource is our youth and I am committed 
to helping the young people of our country and especially those of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to change all their negative directions to positive, and I will spend 
all my energies to help accomplish that goal. I am obviously delighted to be 
doing this work in association with UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
Although details of the settlement were not revealed, Hazzard's attorney, Jerry 
Roth, said, "UCLA met all its obligations (under terms of the original 
contract). 
</P>
<P>
"When I was working with (UCLA counsel) Patricia Jasper, we worked on the 
assumption that we were going to get this thing resolved in a way that would be 
positive both for the university and for Walt. We all feel that that was 
accomplished with this settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"Walt has had an association with the university since he was an undergraduate, 
and so much of his identity comes from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the school appreciates that he ran his program with integrity, 
whatever the reasons why he was dismissed." GRAHAME L. JONES

OREGON STATE BEATS CAL; ARIZONA IS NEXT

<P>
When Oregon State guard Eric Knox was growing up in Inglewood, he dreamed of 
playing basketball at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a little tree house in my back yard, and every day when I was a kid, I 
used to climb up there and look at the Forum," Knox said. "I always wondered 
what it would be like to play at the Forum." 
</P>
<P>
He can stop wondering. 
</P>
<P>
Knox played well in his Forum debut, scoring 27 points as Oregon State defeated 
California, 79-66, Friday in a Pacific 10 Conference tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State plays No. 1-ranked Arizona in a semifinal game today at 1 p.m. 
Arizona beat Washington State, 62-54, Friday to advance to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Knox doesn't fear Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"They're Arizona, they're not the Lakers," Knox said. "They're just a college 
team and they're vulnerable also. We're not going to back down. We're going to 
play hard and we'll see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Miller, Oregon State coach, said he didn't plan to scout the Wildcats, 
who defeated the Beavers by four and 21 points earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not even going to waste time sitting around to watch Arizona," Miller 
said. "I know what they do." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona is 25-3, and Oregon State is 22-6. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Payton, Oregon State's All-Pac-10 point guard, scored 21 points and had 
eight assists before fouling out. Payton scored Oregon State's first 10 points 
to help the Beavers get off to a 16-2 start. 
</P>
<P>
Knox took charge after Cal shut down Payton with a box-and-one defense in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
Cal, which missed its first 11 shots, got into the game with a 17-4 second-half 
run to cut the deficit to 39-35 with 10:56 to play. 
</P>
<P>
But Knox made a key four-point play, sinking a three-point shot and adding a 
free throw with 10:30 remaining, and Cal never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Center Leonard Taylor led Cal (19-12) with 16 points; forward Roy Fisher added 
13, and guard Bill Elleby had 12. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to be playing basketball somewhere next week," Cal Coach Lou 
Campanelli said. "We won 19 games this year and that's a lot to feel good 
about. We'll just wait and see what happens."

WASHINGTON STATE MAKES IT TOUGH; 
</P>
<P>
BUT ARIZONA OVERCOMES SLOWDOWN TACTICS TO WIN, 62-54 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arizona's 62-54 victory over Washington State Friday at the Forum in the 
quarterfinals of the Pacific 10 Conference basketball tournament was far from 
the tour de force expected of the No. 1-ranked Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
Give credit for that to the overmatched Cougars, whose deliberate style of play 
is frustrating even to the best of its opponents. 
</P>
<P>
It is also mentally taxing for the Cougars, though, and may have led to their 
demise, WSU Coach Kelvin Sampson suggested afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State was outscored, 11-4, in the last three minutes as Arizona 
recorded its 15th straight victory against Pac-10 competition, improving its 
overall record to 25-3 by winning for the 17th time in 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to control the tempo so much, and it's not easy to play like that," 
Sampson said. "I think it's easier when you have great athletes and great 
scorers and can go baseline to baseline and get a lot of baskets in transition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tougher to play the way we play, especially mentally. It wears on you as 
the game goes on, but that's the way we have to play." 
</P>
<P>
It was successful for all but the last three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But after Brian Quinnett made a short hook shot to pull the Cougars within 
51-50 with 3:21 left, Sean Elliott started a 7-0 run for Arizona by making two 
free throws with 2:51 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, who scored 12 of Arizona's last 20 points to finish with 17 points 
despite five-of-15 shooting, then rebounded the miss of a three-point attempt 
by Quinnett, who misfired from the left corner. 
</P>
<P>
How did the shot feel as it left Quinnett's hands? 
</P>
<P>
"Felt great," the senior center said. "Looked bad." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona eventually got the ball into the hands of guard Ken Lofton, who hadn't 
made any of his previous four shots, but stepped up with 1:59 left to can a 
three-point attempt from in front of the Arizona bench. 
</P>
<P>
A steal by Elliott on Washington State's next possession led to his driving 
layup, giving the Wildcats a 58-50 lead with 1:06 left. 
</P>
<P>
The threat had ended. 
</P>
<P>
Had the game gone as planned? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah," Coach Lute Olson deadpanned. "That's what I told the guys today: I 
want this thing to go right down to the wire and then we'll knock down every 
shot and every free throw in the final five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, they're very, very coachable young men." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, which has lost only to No. 2-ranked Oklahoma in the last two months, 
won despite registering a season-low point total and making only 41.6% of its 
shots, its worst shooting performance against a Pac-10 foe. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats, who have won 38 of their last 40 games against conference 
competition, will meet Oregon State (22-6) today in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State ended the season with a 10-19 record. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very, very pleased with our effort," Olson said, seriously this time. "I'm 
not pleased with our shooting, but that's going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was a question of not getting the same kinds of shots that 
we've been getting all season." 
</P>
<P>
It was a question of not making them consistently. 
</P>
<P>
Center Anthony Cook was the Wildcats' most effective player, making eight of 16 
shots and leading Arizona with 19 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
His often-overlooked teammate, Jud Buechler, scored 11 points and pulled down 
seven rebounds. And Sampson, whose job requires an eye for such things, later 
described the junior forward as "the greatest role player in America." 
</P>
<P>
Quinnett led Washington State with 20 points and seven rebounds. Guard Harold 
Wright scored 12 points for the Cougars, who finished eighth in the Pac-10.

USC PUTS UP FIGHT BUT LOSES TO STANFORD, 66-61 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Stanford forward Adam Keefe may be a freshman, but he plays like a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Keefe came off the bench to score 17 points as the No. 12-ranked Cardinal 
defeated USC, 66-61, Friday night in a Pacific 10 Conference tournament 
quarterfinal game at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"Keefe is one of the top 10 freshmen in America," USC Coach George Raveling 
said. "He hasn't a chance to show what he can do because Stanford has a senior 
team. But he came into one of their biggest games of the season and delivered 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
With starting forward Howard Wright in foul trouble, Keefe rescued Stanford, 
making six of seven shots from the floor. He also sank five of nine free throws 
and had five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Keefe) doesn't really play like a freshman and he doesn't really act like 
a freshman," Stanford guard Todd Lichti said. "He's going to be a great player 
for Stanford. He has a great nose for the ball. He's a good rebounder and 
shoots the ball well. He's really given us a lift." 
</P>
<P>
Wright said Keefe, a former standout for Woodbridge High School in Irvine, was 
the key to the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Adam won the game for us tonight plain and simple," Wright said. "He's not 
going to tell you that because he's modest." 
</P>
<P>
Said Keefe: "I didn't do anything different tonight. But maybe I shot a little 
bit more and things went right for me." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford (25-5) has won 10 straight games, its longest winning streak in 10 
years. The Cardinal will play UCLA in a semifinal game today at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
USC finished with a 10-22 record, but the Trojans took Stanford down to the 
wire. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 52-50, Rich Grande and Anthony Pendleton sank consecutive three-point 
shots to give the Trojans a 56-52 lead with five minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Wright made a layup and added a free throw to bring Stanford within a point 
before Ronnie Coleman made a layup to give USC a 58-55 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford guard Terry Taylor took charge, hitting a three-pointer and setting up 
Wright for a layup. 
</P>
<P>
Keefe then finished off the Trojans with a jumper. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford shut down USC's offense by switching from a zone to a man-to-man 
defense. The Trojans made just one basket in the final three minutes and were 
outscored 11-3. 
</P>
<P>
"A key was changing defenses," Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said. "We went to 
a man defense because we wanted to be more aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
It worked. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Trojans finished the season by losing 22 of 32 games, Raveling 
said he has never been been prouder of a team than he is of the 1988-89 
Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
"I know one thing," Raveling said. "Years from now when I look back, this will 
be the team I'll respect and admire the most. I've had some that have been more 
talented than this team, but there hasn't been a team I respect any more than 
this one because this team's had a tough life. 
</P>
<P>
"This team endured a heavy burden. They were constantly told they were less 
than they were. But they never accepted that. I just wish that once during the 
season someone gave them a little respect." 
</P>
<P>
USC won Stanford's respect. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to give credit to George Raveling and his basketball team," 
Montgomery said. "They had a tough season, but in the end they were still 
playing hard and competing." 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton led USC with 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
Lichti made a fallaway 22-foot jumper at the end of the first half to give 
Stanford a 35-28 lead at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Keefe threw a length-of-the court pass to Lichti, who beat the buzzer with a 
spectacular shot over Calvin Banks. 
</P>
<P>
Keefe had 11 points off the bench in the first half, making all four shots he 
took.

HOT LINE KEEPS TRACK OF WILDFLOWERS IN BLOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wildflowers are starting to bloom earlier this year thanks to winter rains and 
recent high temperatures, according to the Theodore Payne Foundation, a 
nonprofit organization that perpetuates native California flora. The 
foundation's hot line -- (818) 768-3533 -- informs which flowers are blooming 
and where they may be seen. The message is updated each Thursday through May 
31.

WITH CARE, AFRICAN VIOLETS WILL LAST FOR YEARS

<P>
A windowsill dotted with tiny pots of African violets is as much at home in a 
kitchen as is the fragrance of bread being baked. And many of us buy our 
violets just where we buy the ingredients for bread -- at the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
But you may be getting the floral equivalent of day-old goods if you pick up a 
violet during your weekly shopping excursion. 
</P>
<P>
"The violets you see in the grocery store have been grown in greenhouses," says 
Hilda Douglas, president of the Pomona Valley African Violet Society. "They 
usually don't rebloom because they've been forced." 
</P>
<P>
So what do you do if you want a shelf full of pretty violets? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thriving Specimens 
</P>
<P>
Try visiting African violet shows. The folks who sell violets at these 
exhibitions grow their own -- and they grow them in their homes. You'll bring 
home thriving specimens that are happy to live in the real world. 
</P>
<P>
This is a good weekend to do some violet shopping: Not one but two local 
African violet societies are sponsoring shows. 
</P>
<P>
You'll see hundreds of beautiful violets, in almost every shade of blue, 
purple, pink and white. The societies also sponsor talks and demonstrations on 
the care of violets. 
</P>
<P>
Once you've brought your plants home, put them where they'll get 10 to 12 hours 
of indirect light -- sunshine through a sheer curtain, for example -- every 
day. An eastern or southern exposure is ideal. Keep the soil moist but not 
sodden, and feed your violets constantly. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas suggests a powdered fertilizer, such as Peter's, with an even balance 
(many enthusiasts use 20/20/20; the numbers should add up to about 60) of 
nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. She puts a quarter-teaspoonful into gallon 
jugs of water and thus feeds the plants every time they're watered. 
</P>
<P>
If you really want successful plants, Douglas says, be brutal when they first 
join your family. Growers typically boost the phosphorus their plants are given 
for about two weeks before a show to ensure full bloom. 
</P>
<P>
"Flush your new plants with plain water," Douglas says. "The water should run 
right through the pot and out into the sink. Let the plant rest for about a 
week and then start your regular care." 
</P>
<P>
You should also gently pull all blossoms off the plant you've just purchased 
before you put it with any other plants -- bugs usually nestle in the blooms. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to start your own violets," Douglas says. "They propagate by leaf, 
so cut off a leaf on a slant from about the middle of the plant, let it dry for 
about an hour, then put it in a mixture of perlite and vermiculite, with a 
handful of charcoal thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
"Keep it moist, and, in about four weeks, give your leaf a tug. If it won't 
give, you know you have beautiful roots in there," Douglas says. "In two more 
weeks, you'll have a baby plant." 
</P>
<P>
Watch for "suckers," the miniature plants, complete with tiny root systems, 
that grow off the sides of mature plants. These can be trimmed from their 
parent and planted in your perlite-vermiculite mix. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trim and Peel 
</P>
<P>
A well-tended violet will last more than a decade, especially if you keep the 
old bottom leaves pulled off. "You'll start to get this 'neck,' " Douglas says. 
"When this happens, take the plant out of the pot and cut off some of the 
bottom roots." 
</P>
<P>
Then gently scrape the neck and repot the plant with the bottom leaves at soil 
level, leaving some space around the neck. Put a bit of the perlite-vermiculite 
mixture down around the neck. "You'll basically have a new plant after several 
years," Douglas says. 
</P>
<P>
African violets definitely are not suited for the great outdoors. "The critters 
and bugs outside -- thrips, mites and mealy bugs -- are favorite pests," 
Douglas says. "You just don't want violets anywhere near other plants or 
outdoors." 
</P>
<P>
Today from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., the Pomona Valley society's show and sale will be 
held at the Church of the Brethren in La Verne; today from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
and Sunday from noon to 5 p.m., the San Fernando Valley African Violet 
Society's show is on tap at the Panorama Mall in Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
Both shows are free.

PLANT OF THE WEEK

Arecastrum romanzoffianum 
</P>
<P>
Queen palm 
</P>
<P>
Tall tree with large, graceful fronds 
</P>
<P>
One of the most beautiful palm trees in the world, the queen palm is straight 
and tall -- up to 50 feet -- with a wide spread of handsome green fronds. Ideal 
in its proportions, with an arching green umbrella on a grayish shaft, it has 
none of the fragility of the skinny Washingtonia palms nor the stolid-burgher 
quality of the date palms. If one were asked to draw a perfect palm tree, one 
would probably come up with something very much like the queen palm. 
</P>
<P>
But the queen palm is perfect in looks only. It suffers from a fungus called 
pink rot, or Gliocladium vermoeseni, which affects them when they are planted 
in the wrong places: standing in water or subject to cool temperatures, water 
condensation and poor air circulation. 
</P>
<P>
The fungus affects the crown; the leaves fall off, and the tree eventually 
dies. The disease is spread by spores that are wind- or rain-borne, but it can 
be prevented by careful cultivation. Queen palms should not be planted in foggy 
areas by the coast, and they should have excellent drainage wherever they live. 
Keep other trees and shrubs at bay, and don't overwater. 
</P>
<P>
If you cannot guarantee happiness to the queen, the king palm is a good 
alternative. The king palm (Archontophoenix cunninghamiana), with coarser, 
rangier fronds, can tolerate more shade and humidity than the queen, and it is 
(so far) impervious to pink rot. Although not as lovely as the queen, the king 
palm has other advantages: It grows well indoors and the twig-like flower 
parts, when dried, are highly prized by basket makers. JUDITH SIMS

FAMILY SPOTS: ARBORETUM OFFERS A LIVELY INTRODUCTION TO THE ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Environmental Education Fair, today at the Los Angeles State and County 
Arboretum, may have a dry name but it is a lively convention. The point of this 
ambitious annual event is to get youngsters thinking about their environment 
and to teach them at an early age how to care for it. 
</P>
<P>
Children can make solar water heaters with plastic bags and black paper. They 
can touch live sea creatures in "tide pools" brought by the staff of the 
Cabrillo Marine Museum. And they can visit with raccoons, owls and reptiles 
from the Wildlife Waystation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Addresses Various Issues 
</P>
<P>
More than 60 exhibits -- inside and outside Ayres Hall and in a circus tent -- 
will address issues of transportation, air quality and conservation in terms 
that children can understand. Youngsters can participate in water experiments, 
weaving and gardening. Nature games, at 9:15 a.m. and 2 p.m., will use 
activities to illustrate concepts such as food webs (a complex version of the 
food chain) and animal perception (blindfolding children to help them 
understand how animals use other senses). There also will be walking tours of 
the arboretum at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the arboretum and fair is $3 for adults, $1.50 for ages 13 to 17 
and students, and 75 cents for children ages 5 to 12. There is parking at 
nearby Santa Anita Fashion Park with shuttle service to the gate. Clowns will 
entertain shuttle riders with environmentally oriented games. The arboretum is 
at 301 N. Baldwin Ave., Arcadia. Information: (818) 446-8251.

KYLANDER FLOWERS AT CSUN AFTER HIGH SCHOOL BURNOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jude Kylander can safely lay claim to the title of fastest woman swimmer at the 
NCAA Division II championship meet. 
</P>
<P>
She already has anchored three victorious relay teams and won an individual 
title in the 50-yard freestyle sprint. 
</P>
<P>
And her favorite race, the 100-yard freestyle, is scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
But as fast as she is in the water, she was even more of a blur on foot one 
October day in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
You think FloJo can fly? Too bad there wasn't a stopwatch on Kylander, a born 
and bred Pennsylvanian, the first time the light fixtures in her off-campus 
apartment started break-dancing to the tune of a California quake. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Kylander's older brother Fred was on a visit and was there to 
place the event in its proper perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to meet the neighbors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
They both did. Jude said that it was quite a while before they dared go back 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking for an open field to go run in," she said. "Anything away from 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Kylander said that she was more frightened than her brother but "only because I 
could tell he was scared. Normally, nothing bothers him, so I figured if he was 
scared I should be even more." 
</P>
<P>
The following day, Northridge Coach Pete Accardy recalls, Kylander was still 
quaking even though the ground had long since stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"It made me think about coming back home, let me tell ya," Kylander said. 
</P>
<P>
Home for the Kylanders is Warren, Pa., an oil and timber town of about 15,000 
less than 20 miles from the New York border. The area is not considered much of 
a swimming hotbed, which is why Jude, the youngest of four children, was sent 
packing as a high school junior in search of better training. 
</P>
<P>
Mercersburg Academy, a private boarding school in the mountainous southeastern 
part of the state, seemed to have the prescribed combination of aquatics and 
academics. 
</P>
<P>
It was the right choice for many -- Olympic backstroke specialist Betsey 
Mitchell went there, as did several other successful Division I swimmers. But 
it wasn't right for Kylander, who fizzled when faced with the demands of 
mega-mileage workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I got worse each year," Kylander said. "By the time I graduated, I wasn't even 
a contender to look at." 
</P>
<P>
So, while her high school teammates sorted scholarship offers from the likes of 
Tennessee and Texas, Kylander took to the road in search of a team. 
</P>
<P>
First stop: Orlando, Fla., site of the 1985 Division II nationals. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew when I graduated that if I was going to continue swimming I had to be 
realistic," Kylander said. "I didn't want to just go try to hang on at some 
Division I school." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Kylander, who had been a swimmer on strong Clarion State (Pa.) College 
teams, suggested Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"They were always an all-around class act," said Fred, who last swam for 
Clarion in 1982, a year in which CSUN won both the men's and women's national 
team championships. 
</P>
<P>
Clarion, Fred said, was not much of an option. In his two seasons of swimming 
there he suffered through the same type of burnout his sister had experienced 
in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I improved, but not in the leaps and bounds like kids who had been slower 
before they went to Northridge," Fred said. "When I swam against them I 
couldn't understand what kind of magic Accardy had. But I thought that is what 
Jude should have." 
</P>
<P>
No tricks involved, Accardy says. A shot of confidence was all that was needed. 
</P>
<P>
"She came from a good swimming school, but I don't think they worked with her 
head very much," Accardy said. "A lot of swimming coaches put so much stress on 
these kids from such a young age that they all go through plateaus. 
</P>
<P>
"We've picked up a lot of burned-out people and been able to work with them. 
All it is really is developing them emotionally rather than swim-wise." 
</P>
<P>
Although they are 3,000 miles apart, Kylander keeps close contact with her 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Kylander said that the family considers his sister's experience living in 
Southern California as valuable as the education she is receiving. 
</P>
<P>
"We come from a very small and conservative community," Fred said. "You only 
get so much from the books, then maybe 75% is out of life itself. There is no 
better place than Southern California to learn those lessons." 
</P>
<P>
There is no debating that Kylander's swimming has flourished. She has been 
among the elite of Division II sprinters for three years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to her three individual championships, Kylander has been on 12 
title-winning relay teams. 
</P>
<P>
She has been a part of four record-setting relay teams. Northridge is the 
record-holder in the 200- and 800-yard freestyles and the 200- and 400-yard 
medleys. The 400-yard freestyle relay, which will be held today, is the only 
relay record that has eluded CSUN and Kylander. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a shot at it," Accardy said. 
</P>
<P>
The event will be the meet's last race. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a nice way for her to go out," Accardy said.

SLAIN BREA MAN'S TIES TO MUSTANG CLUB ARE PROBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM and TRACY WOOD, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The flamboyant former Highway Patrol officer killed in ambush at the gate of 
his Brea hilltop home tried to buy the notorious Mustang Club topless bar in 
Santa Ana before its operator was also killed in a gangland-style shooting 2 
years ago, a confidential informant told authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park police said Friday that they will investigate the alleged connection 
between Horace Joseph McKenna, 46, who was killed early Thursday, and Jimmy Lee 
Casino, operator of the Mustang Club, who was murdered on New Year's Day, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly a possibility that will have to be explored," Buena Park Police 
Lt. Dick Hafdahl said. "There's a possibility of all of the things that have 
occurred in and around the Mustang bar were all interrelated to McKenna." 
</P>
<P>
The confidential informant told Los Angeles district attorney's investigators 
last year that McKenna, linked by authorities to prostitution, counterfeiting, 
narcotics, gambling and topless bars, had approached Casino about buying the 
bar, according to court documents made public this week. But the informant 
"could offer no additional information," according to the documents. 
</P>
<P>
Casino, an ex-convict who, like McKenna, had served a sentence at Terminal 
Island prison, was murdered when two intruders broke into his luxury 
condominium in Buena Park. After tying up his 22-year-old girlfriend, police 
said, the assailants shot Casino, 48, in the back of the head at close range 
with a small-caliber weapon. 
</P>
<P>
On Christmas Day, 1987, the Mustang Club was nearly destroyed in an arson fire. 
Another fire a few months later finished it off. One man has been convicted and 
another awaits trial for the Mustang arsons. 
</P>
<P>
While authorities have not linked McKenna to the Mustang arsons, he had 
threatened a different Los Angeles topless bar owner in 1978 and mentioned 
prior arson incidents at that club. 
</P>
<P>
"McKenna made reference to the problem (arsons) that happened a few years ago 
at the Wild Goose (bar) in making the . . . threats," the informant told 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna threatened that "If anything happened, it would be worse (than the 
arsons)," the informant said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Under Investigation 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his murder, McKenna was under investigation by several law 
enforcement agencies for conspiracy to launder money, hide assets, tax evasion, 
provide false returns and fraudulent loan applications in connection with his 
alleged hidden ownership of several Los Angeles-area nude and topless bars. 
</P>
<P>
Casino was believed by authorities to have a hidden ownership in the Mustang 
Club. Casino's murder remains unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
However, two men are facing trial in Orange County for the attempted murder of 
William Carroll, an investor in the Mustang Club. Authorities contend that 
Carroll was shot three times in the head May 1, 1987, when he resisted a mob 
takeover of the topless bar. 
</P>
<P>
The confidential informant told Los Angeles investigators last year that 
McKenna and attorney Joshua Kaplan had approached Casino about buying the 
Mustang Club. But on Friday, Kaplan denied it. 
</P>
<P>
"It never happened," Kaplan said. "It's an absolute, utter falsehood. I have 
never represented Mr. McKenna personally in any matter ever, civil, criminal . 
. . personal, whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
"I know who McKenna (was) and I probably had two conversations with him in my 
life," Kaplan added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Represented Club 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan said he once represented the Mustang Club when it won a court case in 
1983. The case was brought by the city of Santa Ana to challenge the bar's 
right to feature topless dancing. 
</P>
<P>
"I represented the Mustang Theater and I know Jimmy (Casino) had some 
participation in that somehow," Kaplan said. "He was either a manager or a 
consultant. I know there were some allegations he" owned the bar. "I know the 
government has said he did." 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan has been active in several disputes throughout Southern California 
involving topless bars. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, he represented prospective club owner John Morrison in an 
unsuccessful attempt to win Fullerton City Council approval for the 
establishment of a restaurant-cabaret that was to have featured topless 
dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan also represents the Casbah A Go-Go in La Habra, which has been battling 
the city over restrictions on club dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan's name is referred to repeatedly in the McKenna investigative files 
unsealed this week in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
"My name seems to come up whenever people in the adult entertainment industry 
are contacted" by police, Kaplan said. "I've represented the (adult 
entertainment) industry for 20 years. It would be very surprising if my name 
didn't come up." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Brea police conceded Friday that they were "back to square one" in 
determining who killed McKenna. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. James Oman, the Brea Police Department's chief of detectives, said his 
men knew nothing about McKenna's purported ties to criminal activities and 
reputed ownership of a string of topless and nude bars until he read about them 
in the morning newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"You're way ahead of us at this point," Oman told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna's alleged ties were detailed in warrants and affidavits released 
Wednesday by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, which -- along 
with Los Angeles and Long Beach police, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies 
and the FBI -- has been monitoring McKenna's activities for months. 
</P>
<P>
But Oman said that until McKenna's murder Thursday morning, Brea police "were 
only minorly aware of him being in town. . . . There was no clue that he was 
going to be murdered." 
</P>
<P>
Oman said he had sent two of his detectives to Los Angeles County on Friday to 
be briefed on the district attorney's ongoing investigation into McKenna's 
past. But he said that while investigators in Los Angeles "are the ones with 
all the information" in the case -- and he was appreciative of their help -- 
Brea would retain control of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"The homicide occurred in Brea," he said. "They've (Los Angeles) got enough 
homicides to keep them busy." 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a tough one," said Capt. Edmund Alecks, head of 
investigations for the district attorney's organized crime section. "It looks 
like an execution, and these things are never easy to solve." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shell Casings Found 
</P>
<P>
Oman said Friday that the only physical evidence found so far in McKenna's 
death are "more than 20" 9-millimeter shell casings at the gate of McKenna's 
35-acre Carbon Canyon equestrian ranch. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna, a 6-foot-6, 300-pound body builder, apparently died instantly from 
multiple gunshot wounds suffered in the gangland-style ambush at his "Tara 
Ranch" home. The shots were fired through the rear side window of his limousine 
at about 12:30 a.m. as McKenna's chauffeur, Robert Berg, 42, was returning to 
the car after unlocking the gated entrance to the estate. 
</P>
<P>
Berg reportedly told investigators that McKenna was asleep in the back seat at 
the time of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Berg and McKenna's 20-year-old son, Michael, said to be at the house at the 
time of the attack -- were both questioned by police and then released pending 
further investigation, according to Oman. 
</P>
<P>
Court documents identify Berg as one of the alleged conspirators in the 
tax-fraud investigation being prepared by the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office. The documents allege that at least eight people conspired 
with McKenna and Michael Woods -- himself a former highway patrolman -- to skim 
money and hide profits from several topless and nude bars in the Los Angeles 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Warrants say that McKenna and Woods are believed to be the hidden owners of 
these bars and that police had been monitoring their alleged activities in 
gambling, prostitution and narcotics for some time. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office said the tax-fraud case was "extremely 
sensitive" because both McKenna and Woods "have maintained associations with 
terminated, retired and currently employed law enforcement officers." The 
office said this warning was included to advise law enforcement officials that 
they might inadvertently reveal something to someone who knew McKenna. 
</P>
<P>
A woman at Woods' Thousand Oaks home said Friday that he was "not available for 
comment," and Oman said Friday afternoon that no attempt had yet been made to 
find or contact him in connection with the murder. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll get to him when we get to him," Oman said. Records show that Woods -- 
along with McKenna and Daniel Fenton Sully, a man identified in the affidavits 
as a functionary in one of the topless bars -- all served together in the 
California Highway Patrol in the late '60s and early '70s. All three were 
assigned as motorcycle patrolmen in the West Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Woods, 47, took a disability retirement in October, 1974, after spending his 
entire tour in the West Los Angeles office. Sully, 55, served in several posts 
before he took a disability retirement in July, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Reached by phone at his home Thursday night, Sully denied any knowledge of 
illegal activity and said he "hardly knows" McKenna. He characterized the 
tax-fraud investigation as "a lot of misinformation," then refused to comment 
further. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Entered CHP Academy 
</P>
<P>
McKenna entered the Highway Patrol academy in June, 1967, and served in the 
West Los Angeles office until June, 1972. He was dismissed by superiors, but 
one year later, on an appeal to the state Personnel Board, had his departure 
reclassified as a "resignation." CHP spokesmen said that state law prohibited 
them from discussing details of McKenna's "rather extensive" personnel file. 
</P>
<P>
The initial dismissal of McKenna -- remembered by associates who asked not to 
be named as a "tall, lanky guy in those days; sort of a goofball, a clown" -- 
occurred at about the same time that he was arrested by Los Angeles police in 
connection with some sort of theft. The nature of the theft, the disposition of 
the case and whether it was connected to McKenna's dismissal were not known 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1976, McKenna was arrested on suspicion of running a large 
prostitution ring in the Inglewood and Lennox areas. Later that same year, he 
was sentenced in federal court to concurrent terms of 5 and 6 years for 
conspiracy and passing counterfeit money. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna served 4 years at a prison camp in Arizona on the counterfeiting 
charges, earning a parole in 1980. Two years later, he was arrested in a San 
Pedro bar -- owned by a former associate -- on suspicion of assaulting an 
off-duty police officer. The charge was reduced, but McKenna was convicted of 
violating his parole and was sent back to the federal prison at Terminal Island 
for another 2 years. Released on parole in 1984, his probation ended in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'First Target' 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Alecks of the district attorney's office said the tax-fraud investigation 
began 2 years later, in 1987, when McKenna was selected as the "first target" 
in a new program to build cases against "full-time criminals." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills attorney Kaplan, who represents several figures named in the 
tax-fraud inquiry, said the search warrants were unsealed because of demands 
from himself and other lawyers "representing a number of individuals who had 
property seized. . . . It's natural to be curious why the government is seizing 
your papers." 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan said the conspiracy claim was fiction. 
</P>
<P>
"The prosecutor's theory that this industry is controlled by one godfather 
figure, if you will -- McKenna -- is contrary to my experience. . . . This has 
never been a violence-ridden business," he said. "The whole thing is really 
surprising. 
</P>
<P>
"My experience with this industry is that it's the most disorganized industry 
there is, lacking any cohesion at all," Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said his own attempts to organize nightclub owners for legal battles 
were failures because "the animosities exhibited between each business 
prohibited them to get together and do anything. If I got six owners in a room 
at one time, I'd get eight opinions." 
</P>
<P>
McKenna's mother, interviewed Friday afternoon on the porch of her modest home 
in the Crenshaw district, described her son as a "wonderful person. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He was . . . a great man to his mother, his father and his family," she said. 
"It's a beautiful man they killed."

62 IN 6 YEARS AT JOHN WAYNE; 
</P>
<P>
ACCIDENTS DO HAPPEN -- EVEN ON THE GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As you rumble down the John Wayne Airport runway toward takeoff, the knot in 
your stomach implores you to stay on the ground, where it's safe. 
</P>
<P>
But there have been 62 accidents on the runways, taxiways and aircraft parking 
areas at the airport since Jan. 1, 1983, Federal Aviation Administration 
records show. They range from the Cessna that skidded to a stop on the runway 
because its pilot retracted the landing gear instead of the flaps, to the DC-9 
jetliner that struck a parked fuel truck. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were 10 such incidents in 1988 -- four more than in 1987 -- 
that's still fewer than the 18 posted for 1984, according to FAA records. And 
although numbers for other airports were not available, FAA and John Wayne 
officials said they believe the airport has one of the lowest accident rates in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers are pretty low, considering the large number of daily flight 
operations we have here," said Kathie Rutherford, airport spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
There were 533,531 takeoffs and landings at John Wayne Airport in 1988, 444,594 
of which involved non-commercial aircraft, according to airport officials. 
There is a daily average of 182 commercial jet departures or landings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety Checks 
</P>
<P>
Jan Mittermeier, assistant airport manager, said: "We maintain a presence out 
on the field to check for safety problems, and when we know a new aircraft is 
going to use this facility, there are all sorts of elaborate plans and drawings 
that are submitted to the FAA showing how that plane is going to get from one 
point to another, with wing clearances and a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
An FAA spokesman in Washington said it is not unusual for some airports -- 
including Los Angeles International and Washington National -- to have dozens 
of mishaps on the ground in a single year. 
</P>
<P>
Because the criteria for classification as a ground accident include runway 
delays and damage to buildings, some listed as ground accidents actually 
occurred in the air, either just before or immediately after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case at John Wayne, for example, on Sept. 27, 1983, when a 
McDonnell Douglas DC-9 jetliner lost power after takeoff and showered flaming 
engine debris on homes below, setting several roof fires. The FAA records show 
that since 1983, four accidents resulted in deaths and four in injuries. Among 
the cases shown in the records: 
</P>
<P>
* September, 1983: A passenger died after walking into a propeller of a small 
Cessna. "The pilot claims that the passenger was warned of the hazard before 
deplaning." 
</P>
<P>
* January, 1984: A pilot was injured when his plane flipped over in the wind 
during landing. 
</P>
<P>
* October, 1984: A pilot died in a fiery crash when the propeller of his small 
Beechcraft came off during takeoff. "Latch spring not installed in proper hub." 
</P>
<P>
* November, 1985: A Piper crashed in a Tustin field on approach to John Wayne, 
injuring the pilot. "Fuel cell bladders not fastened, partially collapsed. This 
reduced fuel capacity. Ran out of fuel, landed in field." 
</P>
<P>
* December, 1985: A pilot was killed when his Piper "struck a tree, then a 
house during landing, after the engine quit. Ran right main fuel tank dry, did 
not switch tanks." 
</P>
<P>
* February, 1986: A pilot died when his small Beechcraft missed the runway on a 
fog-bound approach and crashed in an Irvine parking lot. "Pilot was not 
instrument rated." 
</P>
<P>
* April, 1987: "A baggage loader ran into the side of a parked Continental 
Airlines DC-9. Driver's foot severed. Blamed bad brakes." 
</P>
<P>
* August, 1988: A flight attendant on a BAe-146 jetliner was "injured trying to 
reach seat during takeoff roll. Cabin crew did not hear announcement of 
takeoff." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the accidents involved jet blasts' lifting small planes off the ground, 
blown tires and pilot errors. In one incident, for example, the pilot of a 
small Piper "landed with gear up. Forgot to lower landing gear." 
</P>
<P>
And there's this one, about a Cessna: "Collided with 2 parked aircraft. 
Malfunction of anti-skid control. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And this about one Cessna overtaking another: "Overflew unauthorized Cessna on 
the same runway. Pilot reported he did not hear tower instructions to abort." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Little Damage' 
</P>
<P>
Cargo doors and cockpit windows have blown out on takeoffs, and planes have 
come down hard, collapsing their landing gear. Many of the incidents involved 
student pilots. 
</P>
<P>
But Gary Lackey of Lenair Aviation Inc., a flight school at John Wayne, said 
there is no cause for alarm. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that ground incidents occur often enough to be a headache, but 
there's actually little damage ever done," he said. "Considering the level of 
activity here and the strange mix of flight operations -- with busy airline 
schedules and large numbers of general aviation aircraft -- we are doing very 
well as an airport." 
</P>
<P>
"It's much better now than it was a few years ago," Lackey said. "Now we don't 
have so many problems with the small planes and the big jets getting too close 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the problems occur when the (control) tower has urged a private pilot 
to hurry up and land in order to get out of the way of a big jet," Lackey said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, American Airlines Flight 619 was forced to abort a landing 
at John Wayne and accelerate steeply to avoid a small plane that had taxied 
onto the runway in front of it. 
</P>
<P>
As is often the case, the incident was not reported to the FAA. Barbara Abels, 
an FAA spokeswoman, said such reports are made at the pilots' discretion. 
</P>
<P>
Some owners of small aircraft are worried that the county, which owns the 
airport, may try some day to limit the facility to commercial airlines, air 
taxi services and business jets. So far, however, the number of ground 
accidents has been too low to fuel more than speculation about banning small 
privately owned planes.

Thousands of military personnel and civilians competed Friday in the ninth 
annual Tustin Marine Corps Air Station Volkslauf, better known as the 
10-kilometer mud run. The course includes several stretches of flat running 
areas, "belly busters," a low-crawl pit, a "Rambo Death Ditch," the "Sandbags 
of Iwo Jima" and strategically placed fire trucks that spray the runners, who 
are clad in trousers, T-shirts and boots. The winning all-male military team 
from the Naval Special Warfare Center, Naval Amphibious Base, Coronado, covered 
the course in 45 minutes and 10 seconds, the best time of the day, but not a 
record. Other winning teams were: all-female military team -- Navy Nurses, 
Naval Hospital, San Diego; all-male civilian team -- Team Kilroy, Hash House 
Harriers, Seal Beach; all-female civilians -- Hash House Harriettes, Hash House 
Harriers, Seal Beach; mixed military -- Weekend Warrior Supporters, Marine 
Aircraft Group 46, Detachment E, El Toro; mixed civilian -- Clean Fun, Quintana 
Roo, Westminster; college -- Bonzai Team, University of San Diego Naval Reserve 
Officers Training Corps; high school -- Mud Dogs, Chosan Young Marines, El 
Monte. Proceeds benefit Orangewood, Orange County's shelter for abused and 
abandoned children.

PASSENGER DIES AS MOTORCYCLE RUNS INTO VAN

A female passenger was thrown from a motorcycle and fatally injured when it 
crashed into a van in Huntington Beach, police said Friday. Debbra Egeler, 33, 
of Huntington Beach suffered a broken neck when driver Mark Byres, 31, drove 
into the van on Golden West Street near Warner Avenue on Thursday night. Byres, 
also of Huntington Beach, was arrested on suspicion of felony drunk driving and 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
He was treated for a broken right ankle in the jail ward at UC Irvine Medical 
Center, Huntington Beach, police investigator Brian Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
Egeler died at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center about 3 
hours after the 7:15 p.m. accident, police said. Police said she was not 
wearing a helmet. They did not know if Byres was wearing one. 
</P>
<P>
The two were headed southbound "at a high rate of speed" and "under the 
influence, as far as we're concerned," Davidson said. Hospital blood-test 
results were not available. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a 16-year-old Huntington Beach High School student, also a passenger 
on a motorcycle and also without a helmet, was thrown from the motorcycle and 
killed when it hit a car. 
</P>
<P>
In that accident, Leslie Grossman died on impact when the bike driven by Scott 
Melnyczok, 18, of Daytona Beach, Fla., crashed on Pacific Coast Highway in 
Huntington Beach, about 6 miles from Thursday's crash. 
</P>
<P>
Police reports say Melnyczok was speeding. Melnyczok, who suffered minor 
injuries, was charged with suspicion of manslaughter and felony drunk driving.

5 DEAD SEA LIONS FOUND; TOLL 54 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER L. CHIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five more dead sea lions have washed ashore at Seal Beach and Newport Beach 
within the last week, bringing the total to at least 54 since January. 
</P>
<P>
One washed ashore in Newport Beach and three others in Seal Beach on Thursday, 
officials said. Lifeguards said the bodies were badly decomposed. 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach lifeguard Paul Carter said he found the decomposed head of a sea 
lion on shore last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a biologist, but you could tell it was severed," Carter said, adding 
that he suspected the head had been sliced with some type of blade. "The skin 
was pretty clean and not jaggedy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Joe Cordaro, a wildlife biologist at the National Marine and Fisheries 
Service office in Los Angeles, said that in cases of natural decomposition, 
"it's almost impossible to determine if a head was removed from the body unless 
you actually see someone sever a head from an animal." 
</P>
<P>
"As the animal is rolled around by the surf, the head is snapping back and 
forth, and it doesn't take very long for the head to be severed from the body," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cordaro believes that the sea lions drowned after becoming entangled in 
fishermen's gill nets. About 2,600 sea lions die each year along the West Coast 
from "interaction with fishermen," he said, adding that a few hundred wash 
ashore while most wash out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on our estimation of the number of sea lions that die every year as a 
result of interaction with fishermen and the number that wash ashore, it's a 
small sample of the total number," he said. "We really don't feel there is a 
need for concern at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, federal and private biologists said they believed that most of the 
48 sea lions beached in county waters from mid-January to early February died 
after encounters with fishermen -- either drowning after becoming entangled in 
nets or shot by squid fishermen protecting their catch. 
</P>
<P>
They ruled out disease as a primary cause of death because most of the sea 
lions were dead when they washed ashore. Diseased or malnourished sea lions 
usually struggle to the shore alive. 
</P>
<P>
Sea lions are protected under the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act, but they 
are not listed as an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
Cordaro estimated that there are 67,000 to 107,00 sea lions along the Southern 
California coast and that about 5,600 pups are born each year.

UNDERCOVER OFFICER EVADES BEING RUN DOWN BY CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A police narcotics officer working undercover in a crime-plagued neighborhood 
in Orange opened fire on a late-model car Friday after the driver tried to run 
down his partner, injuring a passenger, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Police Sgt. Timm Browne said the shooting happened at 4:40 p.m. when the 
two plainclothes officers were conducting a narcotics suppression patrol in the 
100 block of West Wilson Street. 
</P>
<P>
Browne said the officers, driving an unmarked car, pulled up behind a 1988 
Nissan with two men sitting in the front seats. While one officer walked up to 
the driver's door, the other approached the passenger side to question the men 
inside, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
"Upon contact, the officers identified themselves with their badges and the 
suspects attempted to flee," he said. "In so doing, they swerved their vehicle 
and attempted to strike one of the officers." 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Browne said, the officer on the passenger side of the car 
"observed one of the suspects with what he believed to be a gun in his hand. 
The officer fired twice at the vehicle and hit the vehicle both times." 
</P>
<P>
The suspects' car sped off, and both officers ran back to their car and gave 
chase. A short distance later, Browne said the two men stopped the Nissan and 
began to run. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, later identified as Salvador Carlos Hernandez, 22, of Buena Park, 
was taken into custody while the other man, identified as Martin Cornejo of 
Orange, ran to an apartment "where he surrendered after a brief standoff," 
Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
Browne added that a handgun was recovered from one of the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Cornejo was taken to St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, where he was treated for a 
minor injury to his right arm. Browne said it was not known whether Cornejo had 
been wounded in the shooting or was injured by something inside the car after 
the shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
Browne said both men may face charges of assault with a deadly weapon "upon 
completion of the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
The narcotics officers were working in the area because of "numerous complaints 
about prostitution, fencing stolen property, narcotics dealing and overdoses" 
in the neighborhood.

UC IRVINE'S STAGGERING FINISH REMOVES THE LUSTER FROM SEASON'S FEW SHINING 
MOMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

"This has been one of those seasons when you wish someone would put an asterisk 
next to the record." 
</P>
<P>
 -- UC Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan 
</P>
<P>
Bill Mulligan has been coaching for 33 years and says he can't remember a 
season so wrought with illness and injury. 
</P>
<P>
But some might suggest that the footnote next to the asterisk following UC 
Irvine's disappointing 12-17 1988-89 season should read: Coach changed the game 
plan more often than his socks. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the Anteaters' inside game suffered because of deep thigh bruises 
to center Mike Doktorczyk and forward Ricky Butler. Each missed a lot of 
practice and one game because of the injury. And a couple of key players missed 
games with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Irvine's struggles this season might have had more to do with something 
Mulligan caught -- Philosophy Flip-Flop Fever. He switched the offensive and 
defensive schemes so many times in the early season, not even the players can 
remember how often. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters were a pressing, running team. Then they were a sagging, 
man-to-man defensive team with a deliberate offense. And they were everything 
in between. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan switched the plan from week to week. He changed it from game to game. 
At least once, he changed it at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
All of which left more than a few players confused about their roles. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan went into the year "more excited than I've ever been." He believed 
that he finally had the athletes to play the way he has always wanted to play, 
a full-court press defense and a run-and-gun offense. 
</P>
<P>
These Anteaters were going to to lead the nation in scoring and fill the 
5,000-seat Bren Center for every game. 
</P>
<P>
But all Irvine accomplished was humiliating itself while opponents scored at a 
rate surpassed only by layup drills. 
</P>
<P>
"We blew it early in the year, doing all that crazy stuff," Mulligan said. "We 
didn't get to practice what we ended up doing. We were working on things in 
February we should have been doing Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my fault we got so far behind. That's my responsibility. I just blew it." 
</P>
<P>
In January, Mulligan discovered how to win with the players he had. The 
Anteaters began to concentrate on getting the ball inside to their big men, 
Doktorczyk and Butler. If defenses sagged too much, the Anteaters' accurate 
outside shooters kept them honest. 
</P>
<P>
Between Jan. 19 and Feb. 18, Irvine was 7-3. The Anteaters were running on all 
cylinders . . . and this team had a big engine: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Guard Rod Palmer, who averaged 15 points on the year, scored 20 to lead 
Irvine in the first victory over Fresno State Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two days later, Doktorczyk, a senior who led the team in scoring (16 points 
per game) and rebounding (eight), made all 12 field goal attempts and scored a 
career-high 28 in the first of three victories over University of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Butler, a 6-foot-7 sophomore who started the season somewhere close to 300 
pounds but survived the fat jokes and became a major factor in Irvine's 
midseason resurgence, scored 23 and grabbed seven rebounds in the Anteaters' 
next victory, a 77-73 victory over Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sophomore forward Jeff Herdman, the No. 1 in the nation in three-point 
shooting for three weeks before falling into a late-season slump, made nine of 
11 shots from the floor and scored 24 points in the Feb. 4 upset of 
then-16th-ranked Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Senior Kevin Floyd, the high-flying, acrobatic crowd-pleaser who tamed his 
temptation to recklessly charge the basket every time he touched the ball to 
become a semi-level-headed point guard, hit an off-balance, leaning 
three-pointer against Pacific to send the game into overtime. Irvine won, 
95-92. Floyd scored 25. 
</P>
<P>
Defense, however, remained a problem. Irvine's interior defense was chronically 
weak and, as a result, opponents made more than half of their field-goal 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Still, when Irvine unleashed all its offensive potential on one night, the 
Anteaters could outscore almost anyone. 
</P>
<P>
They erupted to beat UCLA on Dec. 28 and Las Vegas on Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
"Those wins were obviously the ups," Mulligan said, "but there were a lot of 
downs. We weren't able to win enough of the other games. We beat some very good 
teams, but we didn't beat the teams we felt we should have beaten." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there were a lot of low lights before, between and after Floyd's 
streaking, coast-to-coast layup at the buzzer carried Irvine to a 91-90 victory 
over the Bruins and Herdman's fifth three-pointer of the night put the 
Anteaters ahead by nine in the final minutes of the 99-98 victory over Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
For instance: 
</P>
<P>
LOW -- Irvine, the team with preseason dreams of leading the country in scoring 
and stealing some of that publicity from Loyola Marymount, loses to Georgia 
State in the season opener, 109-84. It isn't pretty. It looks as if the 
Anteaters might lead the nation in points allowed. 
</P>
<P>
LOWER -- Irvine makes a three-game mid-December road swing with stops in the 
desert, the Midwest and the South. It's no vacation. The Anteaters lose to Las 
Vegas, Loyola of Chicago and Virginia to run their road record to 0-4. Then 
they lose four of their next five road games in Big West Conference play and 
are 1-7 away from the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
LOWEST -- The victory over the Rebels had been preceded by an almost equally 
satisfying victory over Fullerton in Titan Gym. And two weeks after beating Las 
Vegas, the Anteaters were celebrating their first victory in Fresno State's 
Selland Arena. The triumphant team returned to finish the season with a 
four-game home stand. A sweep would mean a second-place finish in the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters lost all four. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really disappointing. All year, we'd have the little lapses on defense, 
but we always felt like we could come back with our offense. We learned you 
can't rely on it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, once No. 6 in the country in three-point field goal accuracy, learned 
the hard way. A cold shooting hand is a cruel teacher. The Anteaters made just 
15 of 60 three-point attempts during the four-game flop. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what hurt us," Mulligan said Thursday night after Las Vegas had ended 
Irvine's season with a 102-82 romp in the second round of the Big West 
tournament. "Losing those last four . . . that's what really hurt."

The North team overcame a seven-point deficit by winning the last four matches 
to score a 28-20 victory Friday in the 19th Orange County all-star wrestling 
meet at El Modena High School. 
</P>
<P>
The North led, 13-9, after the first five matches, before the South won three 
consecutive matches, including one pin and one technical fall, to take a 20-13 
lead.

<P>
After the North's Jonathan Williams of Esperanza scored a 4-0 decision over 
Garden Grove's Glenn Frazier in the 175-pound division, El Dorado's John Orten 
gave the North a 22-20 lead by pinning Joe Deschenes of El Modena 3:06 into his 
185-pound division match.

</P>
<P>
The North, which lost to the South the past two years, now trails in the 
series, 10-9. 
</P>
<P>
Two-time state champion Heath Sims of Woodbridge and Ryan Owings of Laguna 
Hills helped key the South's comeback. Sims scored a 19-4 technical fall over 
Esperanza's Dan Shaffer in the 155-pound division match, and Owings pinned 
Buena Park's Matt Acevado with 5:21 gone in his 164-pound match. 
</P>
<P>
In another match featuring a state finalist, Canyon's Ravi Ramsamooj of the 
North, who finished third in the state in the 112-pound division, won a 2-0 
decision over Touradj Durangi of Woodbridge in the 122-pound division. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, the South's Chris Bryant of Garden Grove scored two points on 
an early third period reversal to score a 7-6 decision over Tan Nguyen of 
Esperanza in the 108-pound division; Southern Section 2-A champion Greg Andres 
of Sunny Hills and the North earned a 13-2 decision over Garden Grove's Thomas 
Muro in the 115-pound classification; and 2-A champion Brian Bertrand of Buena

Chris Wilyard. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Nathan Kerley of Mission Viejo scored a 6-4 decision over Buena Park's 
Brent Holmes in the 148-pound classification.

WESTERN DIGITAL SENDING EXECUTIVES TO MOSCOW TO EXPLORE BUSINESS POSSIBILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the U.S. government considers relaxing controls on computer exports to the 
Soviet Union, Western Digital Corp. of Irvine is dispatching several executives 
to Moscow next week to explore ways to do business with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
Three Western Digital representatives will meet with officials of several 
Soviet government agencies "to get a better understanding of what their 
requirements might be," said Joseph Pleso, Western Digital's vice president of 
international sales. 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital manufactures a wide variety of components that are used to 
build personal computers. Pleso said the company hopes to learn more about the 
Soviet Union's plans for increasing the use of PCs throughout its society and, 
possibly, setting up its own PC manufacturing industry. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Soviets intend to build their own personal computer, we'd like to be 
able to sell them our products," Pleso said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considering Change 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the federal government is considering loosening controls on the 
types of PC products that American manufacturers can ship to Soviet Bloc 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Liikala, director of the Newport Beach office of the U.S. Bureau of 
Export Administration, said the government is reviewing whether to allow 
exports to the Soviet Union of PCs that use a microchip first introduced in the 
United States in 1982. The particular technology under review involves 
so-called 286-based computers powered by Intel Corp.'s popular 80286 microchip. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an assessment being done in Washington as to whether 286-based 
computer technology is currently available in sufficient quantity and quality 
from other (Western nations) to the Soviet Union," Liikala said. "If we 
determine that's true, then we're required by Congress to decontrol these 
products and allow them to be shipped to the Eastern Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not state-of-the-art technology, and that's why we may decontrol it," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Personal computers using the Intel 80286 chip are widely available from foreign 
manufacturers in Japan, South Korea and other nations. The most advanced 
personal computers manufactured in the United States and other Western nations 
use more sophisticated chips such as the Intel 80386, which came to the market 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
A lifting of a ban on 80286 technology would not only affect personal computer 
makers but also producers of medical, oceanographic and other electronic 
equipment that use that type of microchip, Liikala said. 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital has already had some business dealings with the Soviet Bloc. 
Last July, the company announced a contract to sell more than $1 million of 
computer components to a Bulgarian company. 
</P>
<P>
But 8 months later, the Irvine firm has yet to ship its first product to 
Bulgaria because the Department of Commerce hasn't yet approved an export 
license. 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital's Pleso said the company still expects government approval for 
the Bulgarian order, and isn't sure what is causing the delays. "They (the 
Commerce Department) just keep saying, 'We're still working it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Liikala said the Commerce Department is often slow to approve export licenses 
to the Soviet Bloc, partly because they sometimes also require approval by the 
Defense Department and other agencies. But he said the average time for 
processing licenses to the area was 50 days last year. He could not explain why 
the Western Digital application is taking so much longer.

FATHER-SON TEAM FOUND GUILTY OF BILKING INVESTORS IN RARE-COIN SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The father-son masterminds of a Costa Mesa rare-coin scam were found guilty in 
federal court in Santa Ana on Friday of conspiracy, mail fraud and wire fraud 
for bilking investors out of $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The jury found Vincent L. Caterino, 58, of Riverside guilty on all 22 charges 
against him. His 28-year-old son, James N. Caterino, a Costa Mesa resident also 
known as Jack Elder, was found guilty on 20 of the charges against him. The 
jury was hung on one charge of using a fictitious name in a scheme to defraud 
and one charge each of mail and wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sentencing on May 19 
</P>
<P>
When the two men are sentenced on May 19, Vincent Caterino could receive up to 
110 years in a federal prison. James Caterino could be sentenced to a maximum 
100 years and fined up to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The two men -- along with five colleagues -- were indicted by a federal grand 
jury last September for a telemarketing scheme called Marco Numismatics that 
bilked more than 500 investors out of $6 million, said Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Thomas J. Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
From the summer of 1985 through last September, the company sold mostly ancient 
Greek and Roman coins, including the silver denarius and double denarius and 
the gold aureus. 
</P>
<P>
Although the coins were authentic, Umberg said, the basis of the case against 
Marco was that the company "misrepresented the value, quality and liquidity of 
the coins" they sold to investors throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Of the misrepresentations alleged in the indictment, the most important was 
that investors could liquidate their coins upon demand. Marco officials told 
customers that the company would act as a broker and sell their coins to 
willing buyers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coins Overpriced 
</P>
<P>
The truth, Umberg said, was that the investors were stuck with grossly 
overpriced coins and no way to recoup their money. Trial evidence showed that 
Marco salesmen sold sets of coins called the Twelve Caesars of Rome to 
investors for $28,000, when in truth the coins were worth about $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The coins they (Marco) sold could be purchased on average at about 10% of what 
they were selling them for," Umberg said after the indictment. "They (Marco) 
also purchased one type of coin -- the Roman denarius -- for $35 and would sell 
it for approximately $600." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Marco salesmen also would "churn" their clients' accounts, Umberg 
said, performing an unnecessary number of transactions on behalf of the 
customers to reap increased commissions. 
</P>
<P>
The federal jury could not reach a decision Friday in the case against Nicholas 
Caterino, 50, of El Toro or Brian Thompson, 28, of Orange. Nicholas Caterino is 
Vincent's brother and was Marco's coin buyer. Thompson was a sales 
administrator for Marco. 
</P>
<P>
During the 5 1/2-week trial, three Marco salesmen pleaded guilty to lesser 
charges. Patrick Zaremba, 28, address unknown, pleaded guilty to one count of 
felony wire fraud. Mark Colacchio, 29, of Corona, and Keith Taylor, 32, of 
Laguna Niguel each pleaded guilty to one count of felony mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Zaremba, Colacchio and Taylor, who was also known as Mike Green, will be 
sentenced on April 20. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased with the outcome as to defendants James and Vincent Caterino, 
and we're prepared to retry the other two," Umberg said.

"Now we begin. Quiet! Right now! Sit down!" ordered Assistant Principal Steve

Roy Conboy's play "Happy Birthday, Angel," is the tale of an 8-year-old boy who 
is killed in a drive-by shooting and then must follow a bewildering path to 
discover his self-worth in order to return to the living. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Repertory Theatre's community outreach program is now presenting 
the piece at elementary and intermediate schools in areas of the county where 
drive-by shootings and other types of gang violence are a very real part of 
life to teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to get to the children who, while too young to join now, are already 
being confronted with these issues through older siblings and neighbors," said 
Jose Cruz Gonzalez, director of the play. 
</P>
<P>
While South Coast Repertory is taking its anti-gang piece to county schools, 
another theater group is launching its own socially conscious, issue-oriented 
production to specific audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, Teatro Cometa, a neighborhood theater group in Fullerton, will debut 
"Zero Dolares la Hora: Ya Basta" ("Zero Dollars an Hour: Enough Already"). The 
short piece on exploitation of undocumented workers will play at Santa Ana High 
School before hundreds of English-as-a-second-language students from throughout 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"Angel" and "Zero Dolares" share a didactic quality reminiscent of Luis Valdez' 
"El Teatro Campesino," which started by performing on a flatbed truck for grape 
pickers during the United Farm Workers' grape boycott in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's stylistic theater . . . a teaching element," said Gonzalez, adding, 
though, that "we're not politicians, we're artists. Yet we're able to combine 
art and still reflect what's happening in the community. . . . It's a good 
one-two punch." 
</P>
<P>
The message of "Angel" is one that the Rev. Jesse Jackson made famous with the 
"I am . . . somebody" refrain with which he often peppers his talks to 
youngsters. After Angel (Robert Almodovar) is shot by tough-talking, Dead 
Street gang-member El Gato (Vic Trevino), he is given a chance to return to the 
living by taking part in an otherworldly game show, "Don't Mess Up or You're 
Dead." He encounters three spirits: baseball star Roberto Clemente (Robert 
Crow), aviator Amelia Earhart (Angela Moya) and Mexican revolutionary Emiliano 
Zapata (Crow) -- who challenge him to follow his dreams and discover his 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
But in each case, El Gato persuades Angel that he is a "nobody" and shouldn't 
put forth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, get a grip, ese," Gato says to Angel when he is within one strike of 
fanning Clemente and returning to life. "They want you to try real hard just so 
you can fail. . . . It's all rigged." 
</P>
<P>
Gato tells Angel that he can join the Dead Street gang and be a "somebody" by 
committing the same crime that ended his own life. At the moment of truth, 
Angel shrugs off Gato's influence and says the magic words -- "I am somebody" 
-- and the game show host (Moya) returns him to life, much to the relief of 
Lathrop's young audience, which had had just about enough of Gato's negativism. 
</P>
<P>
"We adjust depending on the age of the kids," said Trevino, who was mobbed by 
autograph-seekers after the performance when it was announced that he appears 
on "Pee-wee's Playhouse" each Saturday morning. "We use a smaller gun with 
younger kids, and we don't aim it out at them." 
</P>
<P>
Lathrop sixth-graders seemed to grasp the play's message, more or less. 
</P>
<P>
"It was good that he (Angel) didn't kill the girl," Ricardo Romero said. The 
lesson was that you should "do what good people tell you to do, not bad 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Cazares, 12, thought the play was "nice." 
</P>
<P>
"It was OK . . . not to join the gang," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe will perform the play next week at schools in La Palma, Anaheim, 
Buena Park and Santa Ana, and may give additional performances if there is 
demand, Gonzalez said. Pacific Bell has underwritten the production with a 
$10,000 grant. 
</P>
<P>
While the SCR troupe faces the problem of performing before a squirmy audience, 
Teatro Cometa's most difficult task is finding -- and keeping -- performers. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Gomez, a Fullerton native, started the group in 1979 and still runs it. 
He also writes most of its material. 
</P>
<P>
"Zero Dolares" was commissioned by Orange County Human Relations Commission 
staff member Barbara Considine, who works with undocumented laborers and saw a 
need for a better way to get information across to them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people remember a message much more clearly when they identify with 
what's going on up there on the stage," Considine said. Putting that message in 
a play is more powerful, she said, than "if a county social worker is up there 
telling you what your rights are." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez wrote the piece for six actors, but the recent departure of two troupe 
members -- one due to illness, the other because he had to take a job out of 
town -- forced him to do some quick revisions. At the moment, Teatro Cometa 
consists of Gomez, his two sisters, Lukie Ramos and Yolanda Gomez-Rivas, and 
Rene Acosta, a newcomer to the group. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people in neighborhoods like this don't know about the theater," said 
Gomez, who will receive an award from the Human Relations Commission on Sunday 
both for his theater work and his work as resident manager of the New Vista 
Shelter in Fullerton. He runs the theater group out of a food distribution 
center in back of a park. "Part of our work is to stimulate interest in the 
community . . . to get them excited and show that there is an alternative to 
partying and stuff -- which is OK." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez studied theater at Cal State Fullerton and performed with the Mascarones 
theater group in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in 1977 and 1978. When he returned to 
Fullerton, he formed Teatro Cometa, and in 1979 the group toured the state with 
a production of Gomez's "La Confusion y El Desmadre" ("The Confusion and The 
Disorder"), which dealt with "the confusion of youth," Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
"Zero Dolares," a melange of Spanish and English, is straightforward agitprop 
theater. The scene is a street corner in Orange, where scores of men assemble 
each day hoping to be picked up by contractors and other patrones. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the workers, named Pollo, winds up being stiffed by his employer, a 
contractor at a "Rancho Santa Margarita" development. Pollo goes back to the 
job site in search of the unscrupulous employer and finds a TV news reporter 
interviewing other workers. Through the interaction comes advice on how to 
avoid being ripped off: getting the license number of the boss's truck, his 
address and phone number and a firm understanding of the system of payment. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of stuff happens everyday," Gomez said. "A lot of those guys are 
ripped off. . . . This play is aimed at the workers, letting them know that 
there are ways to protect themselves, precautions to take. At the same time, 
it's something that (other) people need to know. They think they go to work and 
everyone gets paid." 
</P>
<P>
The first audience to see the play will be 1,200 English-as-a-second-language 
students -- many of whom are illegal aliens or recent amnesty applicants. 
Considine, who is scheduling the performances, hopes to take it to similar 
groups around the county. 
</P>
<P>
"The audience we want is already there," Considine said. Pacific Bell is 
underwriting the first 10 performances of "Zero Dolares" with a $1,000 grant, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez would also like to take the play directly to workers waiting out on the 
street corners. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll get a kick out of it," Gomez said. 
</P>

The next time you are sitting in your car, creeping along the San Diego Freeway 
in an endless stream of bumper-to-bumper traffic, imagine instead sitting in a 
sailboat at anchor in the crescent-shaped cove of a deserted island, ringed by 
a white-sand beach, perfectly manicured by each high tide. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of traffic sounds, you hear a gentle rustling on the water as the 
turquoise lagoon comes alive with clouds of dense, silvery fish. Snorkeling in 
the lagoon -- a body of water as clear as a back-yard swimming pool -- is like 
swimming through a Jacques Cousteau special. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the world of cruising -- a world where there are no cars, no 
Sig-Alerts, no phones, no mortgage payments, no schedules except those imposed 
by wind and weather. If you have ever dreamed of chucking it all and sailing 
off into the sunset, you are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
Each year in the United States, dozens of ordinary 9-to-5 people slip the bonds 
of an urban existence and sail away to live afloat for a year or longer, 
according to the Seven Seas Cruising Assn., a worldwide club based in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
But even paradise has its hazards. Instead of traffic accidents, there are 
storms at sea, treacherous coasts and hostile foreign governments -- and 
intense strains on personal relationships. Instead of mortgage payments, there 
are engine repair bills and port fees. 
</P>
<P>
When Art and Cheresse Smoot of Rossmoor set sail for Mexico in their 37-foot 
catamaran last month, their departure represented 7 years of hard work 
preparing for a 5-year voyage that will take them from the Gulf of California 
to Tahiti and eventually the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Art Smoot, 40, and Cheresse Smoot, 39, had been dreaming of this trip since 
1974, when they took a 6-month sabbatical -- which stretched into a year -- to 
go sailing with her parents, who had retired. "That's when we developed a real 
love for this type of life," said Cheresse Smoot, who has been sailing since 
she was a child. "But we had to come back and get to work." 
</P>
<P>
When the Smoots returned to Orange County, both were in their mid-20s, and both 
set out to establish successful careers -- she as a banking executive and he as 
a computer programmer. But they made a pact. 
</P>
<P>
"We promised ourselves that we would work and save, and that we'd be out of 
here by the time we were 40," she said, her face flushed with excitement a few 
days before departure. 
</P>
<P>
"We figure that if we left when we were 40 and were gone 5 years," Art Smoot 
said, "we could still come back and start another career and work 20 years and 
retire like everybody else at 65. 
</P>
<P>
"Where I worked, I saw a lot of people who were there 20 or 25 years and wanted 
to do something. Maybe not go cruising -- but something. So they waited all 
their lives until they retired. By then they were often physically disabled and 
couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
For the Smoots, working toward their cruising dream affected the very fabric of 
their lives. For example, even though they bought a house in 1979 (mostly as an 
investment), they never bothered to furnish it with what Cheresse Smoot calls 
"nice things. We didn't spend money buying china and crystal because what do 
you do with it when you leave?" 
</P>
<P>
The Smoots never owned a videocassette recorder or even a TV until her mother 
gave them one. "We just didn't buy those things because our attitudes were so 
different," Cheresse Smoot said. "We always lived below our income. We kept 
very tight budgets, and for 10 years we saved money for this trip." 
</P>
<P>
"We just started packing away any money we had," added Art Smoot, a lanky, 
soft-spoken man with an air of quiet determination. 
</P>
<P>
The Smoots also chose to remain childless, a decision they said was made 
independently of their decision to go cruising -- but one that they believe 
made it easier for them to pursue their dream. 
</P>
<P>
They said they met many couples cruising with children during the year they 
were away. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw people out there doing very well with children, and the kids were 
becoming independent, marvelous kids," he said. "But having kids is a huge 
effort. You've got to get your head down and work, and it makes it more 
difficult to do something like this." 
</P>
<P>
With or without children, the Smoots admitted that breaking away is not easy. 
They sold their home in May to pay for the cruise. "And we recognize that we 
may not be able to come back here," he said. "We have accepted that." 
</P>
<P>
Since April, the Smoots have been living aboard the catamaran they bought and 
began refurbishing about 10 years ago. They sold off all their belongings, 
except for a car they will keep stashed in Orange County to use during 
occasional trips home. 
</P>
<P>
"Our plans are sort of open-ended because it depends on what the budget will 
handle," said Cheresse Smoot, sounding more like the bank executive than the 
sailor. They expect to be gone for 5 years and have enough money in savings to 
live on. They estimate that they can live well in Mexico for about $2,500 a 
year and in the South Pacific for about $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
"And we have saved up 6 months' salary so that when we come back we have our 
re-entry financed," Art Smoot said. 
</P>
<P>
While they are away, their mail and banking will be handled by her mother in 
Oregon. "She understands the attraction of this life style, because she and my 
father lived aboard a boat for 7 years," Cheresse Smoot said. 
</P>
<P>
"In your own boat, you can get into places you can't see any other way," she 
said in a soft, wistful voice, as if remembering that yearlong cruise 15 years 
ago. "You can see a beautiful anchorage. Or sail along with pilot whales 
feeding off your bow." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going because we want to get away together," he said, "to experience the 
simplicity and beauty of the world outside the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, it's an adventure. A great thing to do -- to see how far you get, and 
when we get back to say, 'We did it!' This is an experience of a lifetime, 
where our lives depend on each other." 
</P>
<P>
He glanced briefly at his wife, sitting close beside him in the boat's cramped 
interior. "We'll get to see the strength of each other. Most people don't get 
to see that in their spouse." 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Orange County in 1980, Leo and Dolores LaJeunesse -- Lee and Dee 
-- spent 5 idyllic years sailing 16,000 miles down the Pacific coast of Mexico, 
through the Panama Canal and on to Florida and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
The cruise was everything they hoped it would be: deserted islands, sandy 
beaches, sunny skies, fresh seafood, pure air and tranquillity. And if things 
had stayed that way, the LaJeunesses probably would still be at sea. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they are back in Costa Mesa, land-bound in a small apartment, having 
lost everything -- including their boat, which went aground in heavy surf near 
Zihuatanejo, Mexico, 4 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The boat was uninsured," said Dee LaJeunesse, 56, a trim part-time dance 
instructor. 
</P>
<P>
"I found that it is the little things you miss (from the lost boat). After 
years of accumulating minor things, you'd go to reach for a whisk or a spoon 
and they weren't there. It was like starting housekeeping all over again. And 
(once back in the county) it was hard having to dress up, act perky and go 
looking for a job." 
</P>
<P>
"We were too young for Social Security," said Lee LaJeunesse, also 56 and a 
former associate dean at Orange Coast College. "And it's not easy beginning a 
career again when you're over 50." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the LaJeunesses, with the resilience of eternal optimists, have 
re-established careers -- he as vice president of a Christian educational 
organization and she as database manager for the same company. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the tragic end for their cruising life style -- and despite a heavily 
publicized incident in 1985 in which they were intercepted by the Nicaraguan 
military and detained by gun-toting soldiers for 18 days -- the LaJeunesses 
said they have no regrets about selling their home and taking off on their 
sailing adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Lee LaJeunesse had long dreamed of sailing his own boat through the Panama 
Canal. About 11 years ago, when he and his wife were in their mid-40s, he began 
to make serious plans for such a trip. With their three children grown and on 
their own, the LaJeunesses sold the four-bedroom home they had owned in Costa 
Mesa since 1963. 
</P>
<P>
"We sold it to enable us to buy the boat," he said. "You have to have some 
capital and some money in the bank in order to do this." 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that if we didn't do it then, we might not be able to do it as we 
aged," said Dee LaJeunesse, who had never sailed until she began preparing for 
the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"And besides, we were tired of Orange County life in the fast lane," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Lee took a year's leave of absence from his job, which he later 
changed to a simple resignation so they could continue cruising indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
From 1980 to 1983, the LaJeunesses traveled 10,000 miles in a 35-foot sailboat, 
which took them from California through the Panama Canal to Florida, where they 
sold the boat and bought a larger one. 
</P>
<P>
"The first one was just too small," he said. "So we bought a 61-foot steel 
ketch." 
</P>
<P>
The boat needed a lot of work, so the LaJeunesses spent months scraping off old 
paint, patching the hull and repainting the boat. They finally set sail again 
in June, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later, their cruising life came to an abrupt halt when they were 
intercepted by the Nicaraguan military while anchored at Big Corn Island, near 
the Nicaraguan coast, to make engine repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Their boat suffered extensive damage while in the hands of the Nicaraguans, and 
the LaJeunesses suffered extreme psychological damage during their 18-day 
ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
When they were finally released, she flew home and he sailed the boat on to 
Panama, where he sold it and bought a smaller one. He was on his way back to 
California for rest and recuperation when he ran aground and wrecked the boat 
on the Mexican coast. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nicaraguan thing was really bad," he said, his voice tinged with 
bitterness. "It was really a hostage situation. And at that time, naturally, we 
were unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
"But we still didn't have any regrets about what we were doing. Now, the 
passage of time has eroded some of those bad memories, and I believe that 
everything was worth it." 
</P>
<P>
She is even more philosophical: "There is no question about it. Cruising is a 
high-risk life style. But what happened to us could have been a lot worse. We 
could have drowned at sea." 
</P>
<P>
"If the circumstances at the end hadn't been what they were, we would probably 
still be out there," said Lee LaJeunesse, who would like to set sail again, 
this time to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd really like to do another extended sail." 
</P>
<P>
John La Montagne celebrated his 70th birthday Nov. 11, 1988, in the San Blas 
Islands near Panama, after accomplishing a lifelong dream of sailing his own 
boat through the Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
A retired real estate broker, La Montagne and his wife, Joan, 65, a Corona del 
Mar psychologist, left Newport Beach on Jan. 5, 1988, "just to sail around," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Friends say, 'Are you sailing around the world?' And I say, 'No, just sailing 
around,' " said La Montagne, a silver-haired former Navy commander. 
</P>
<P>
The couple are living aboard their 51-foot sailboat in the Bay Islands of 
Honduras, while trying to decide where to go from there. Recently, the La 
Montagnes returned to visit relatives in Orange County, where they talked about 
their first year at sea. 
</P>
<P>
So far, despite a couple of harrowing storms, they have no regrets about making 
the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"We both feel good that we have done it," said Joan La Montagne, who learned to 
sail in the Balboa Island Yacht Club as a child. "We have both been sailing all 
our lives. So our own lives have prepared us to be doing what we are doing. I 
knew sailing, and John was a Navy commander and knew all about the ocean. So 
this was a dream we both had." 
</P>
<P>
But it was a dream that had to be put on hold while they reared three children. 
After the children were grown and John had retired, Joan La Montagne -- a 
youthful woman with a spirit of adventure -- agreed to take a sabbatical and do 
some extended cruising with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Once the decision to go was made, the La Montagnes sold their home and other 
investment property to buy a sailboat. They also bought a small condominium in 
Dana Point, where they lived until it was time to sail away. 
</P>
<P>
"When we left, we rented the condo and put all our furniture in storage," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to their financial independence, the La Montagnes set sail in a bigger, 
more luxurious boat than many cruisers can afford. And because of their 
advanced ages, they are traveling with a crew. During the yearlong trip, they 
have had seven different crew members, mostly family friends from California 
who fly in and meet them along the way. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a crew," he said, "because the boat is large and I feel better with 
help along. If I were 25 or 30 years old, it might be different, but I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
During the year they have been cruising, said La Montagne -- who looks much 
younger than his 70 years -- his health has never been better. "I used to get a 
ringing in my ears all the time here," he said about Orange County. "Since I 
have been cruising, it never happens. I've been back here a few weeks now, and 
the ringing has started again." 
</P>
<P>
Although the La Montagnes said they have had many idyllic experiences, they 
were quick to point out that the cruising life is not as rosy as yachting 
magazines would have you believe. "You have good times and bad times," he said, 
"but that is true of life, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best times have been spent at anchor in a snug harbor, off a 
deserted tropical island. And some of the worst times have been sailing through 
raging storms at sea, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The scariest time was in a storm off Nicaragua," Joan La Montagne said. "There 
was thunder and lightning. Winds to 45 knots. Horizontal, wind-blown rain. I 
was absolutely drenched. There were squalls everywhere. The thunder and 
lightning were so scary that I really thought, 'Well, this is it.' 
</P>
<P>
"I always wondered how I would react in a situation like that. The surprising 
thing was I got really calm inside. At a time like that it's between you and 
God." 
</P>
<P>
An articulate, introspective woman, she admitted that she does not enjoy the 
cruising life as much as she thought she would. 
</P>
<P>
"Two things bother me," she said. "Anxiety is one. I have been anxious for my 
safety. I meditate and try to keep myself on a calm, even keel, but it is 
difficult. Also, cruising is a hard life. It is not comfortable. It's like 
being on a permanent camp-out." 
</P>
<P>
She also misses her work, her friends, her family and her professional life. 
</P>
<P>
"I have concluded that I was happier in my life here than on the boat," she 
said. "But I do not regret what we are doing. I wanted to get away from the 
pressure of ordinary society. I was getting discouraged about some things in 
our society. Disillusioned. 
</P>
<P>
"Now (after cruising for a year), the U.S. never looked so good. I have never 
been prouder to be an American. We live in such a paradise and don't know it." 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, when we left here," her husband said, "we thought we would spend 
the rest of our lives doing this. Now Joan knows she doesn't want to." 
</P>
<P>
According to an informal survey of 80 cruising couples in La Paz, Mexico, in 
1985, many women share Joan's feelings. During the 1985 cruising season, 14 out 
of 80 cruising couples separated during the first few months. Most of those 
wives flew home, leaving their husbands alone on the boat. 
</P>
<P>
The La Montagnes agreed that the tension associated with the risks of cruising 
can strain a relationship. However, after 42 years together, they have no 
worries about their own marriage. "I know that one of the ways to make a 
successful trip is to keep a happy wife," he said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Although the La Montagnes eventually plan to come back home, they are in no 
hurry. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal was to get to the Virgin Islands," he said, "but it isn't that 
important to us anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care where I go as long as I'm going. To me, this is a fulfillment of 
something I have always wanted to do, and I am doing it while I am still young 
enough to enjoy it. It is so damned hard to be an individual these days. 
Cruising is an expression of your own individuality." 
</P>
<P>
Why does cruising hold such appeal -- despite the hardships people such as the 
LaJeunesses have suffered?

"I don't know," Lee LaJeunesse said. "I suppose it's the sense of adventure, of 
traveling and seeing the world. Of being your own person. The sea is the last 
frontier. It's a challenge. Maybe the last challenge a man or a woman can 
face." 
</P>
<P>
Cruising is also an enriching experience, one that can literally change a 
person's life, he said. "Your values change. The money-grubbing and the rat 
race don't seem as important anymore." 
</P>
<P>
As for advice to others contemplating the cruising life, he said: "Do it, but 
weigh the consequences. And learn all you can about sailing and cruising before 
you go." 
</P>
<P>
"But don't do what we did," Dee LaJeunesse said. "Don't sell everything before 
you go. I wish I hadn't cut my ties with land so completely. And I would never 
want to encourage anyone who had never gone to sea before to do it without 
trying a short cruise first."

Later this month St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Fullerton 
expects to become the first hospital in Orange County to open skilled-nursing 
facilities on their premises. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Ross, the hospital's vice president for rehabilitation and mental health 
services, said the hospital expects to start admitting patients to its 37-bed 
skilled-nursing facility on March 21, assuming it obtains final state licensing 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
He said the skilled-nursing facility will take patients released from 
acute-care hospitals -- primarily from St. Jude Hospital -- who need special 
rehabilitation and other nursing services before returning home or to 
convalescent facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It allows us to have the patients receive the most appropriate and economical 
level of care," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Ross said that hospital-based skilled nursing services have the advantage of 
providing convenience to the patients who can use the hospital's diagnostic 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
He said the skilled-nursing facility is housed on one floor of a wing at St. 
Jude Hospital that previously contained administrative offices and various 
ancillary services. Over the past six months, he said, that space has been 
converted for patient beds as well as a rehabilitation gym, beauty shop and 
recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
Room and board at the new nursing facility will cost $250 a day, Ross said. 
Approved Medicare patients -- representing the vast majority of patients -- 
will pay $25.50 a day for the first 8 days. After that, he said, Medicare will 
pick up the entire tab for care up to 150 days. 
</P>
<P>
Also planning to open skilled-nursing facilities are Anaheim Memorial Hospital 
and Friendly Hills Regional Medical Center in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
Katherine Dopler, director of communications at Anaheim Memorial Hospital, said 
that hospital already has received state approval for a 20-bed skilled-nursing 
facility scheduled to open April 24. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Friendly Hills Regional Medical Center, previously La Habra 
Community Hospital, is planning to convert about 36 of its acute care hospital 
beds to skilled nursing beds. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hanna, the hospital's administrator, said architectural plans for the 
skilled-nursing facility, which will be established in part of the existing 
hospital, are under review by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and 
Development. He said he hopes the facility will open in the late spring or 
early summer. 
</P>
<P>
John Gilwee, director of the Orange County office of the Hospital Council of 
Southern California, said he welcomes the trend toward the creation of 
hospital-based skilled nursing facilities. He said it gives hospitals a 
potentially profitable opportunity for diversification while providing a needed 
medical service. LESLIE BERKMAN
