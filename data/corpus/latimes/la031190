GREED AND GLUTTONY IN THE FOREST PRIMEVAL; 
</P>
<P>
THE FATE OF THE FOREST: DEVELOPERS, DESTROYERS AND DEFENDERS OF THE AMAZON BY 
SUSANNA HECHT AND ALEXANDER COCKBURN (VERSO: $24.95; 254 PP., ILLUSTRATED) 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For those of us -- most, I think -- who know little of South American history, 
Susanna Hecht and Alexander Cockburn provide a comprehensive and scholarly, if 
not disinterested, political and economic history of tropical South America. 
"What is now called the environmental destruction of the Amazon is merely the 
latest surge in a long epic of annihilation," writes Hecht, an agronomist in 
the UCLA Graduate School of Planning, and Cockburn, enfant terrible and 
left-wing British journalist. 
</P>
<P>
The developed world confronts its own complicity in tropical devastation. Hecht 
and Cockburn argue that only a "socialist ecology" can save the Amazon. Whether 
that analysis is correct or not, they offer -- at last -- an overview of the 
situation, not as some idiosyncrasy of this fading century but in the context 
of a South American history few Norte Americanos, including conservationists, 
know anything about. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a century before Charles Goodyear discovered how rubber could be 
stabilized through vulcanization in 1842, the latex sap of Hevea brasiliensis 
and its relatives was already in world trade as waterproofing for a vast array 
of materials. By mid-19th Century, it was the focus of Brazil's economy, and by 
the end of it, American business interests that would eventually include Henry 
Ford and Daniel Ludwig began their Brazilian adventures. 
</P>
<P>
The boom in rubber, until its collapse when purloined seeds reached their 
maturity in other tropical regions, led not only to great fortunes but 
development far up the Amazon River into the eastern foothills of the Andes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite astronomic surges and catastrophic plunges in the Brazilian economy, at 
the end of the World War II, the Amazonian forest was little different than it 
had been at the time of European discovery. But then began a geometric process 
that in 40 years would lead Amazonia to the brink of catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
To Cockburn and Hecht, this was no consequence of overpopulation, no failure of 
"inappropriate technology." It was the product of foreign capital conspiring 
with Brazilian elites living outside Amazonia -- neither of whom had any 
interest in its welfare -- attempting to extract maximum wealth from the region 
and with virtually no interest in the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians and the rubber-tappers -- the seringueiros -- of Amazonia, and for 
that matter the landless peasants who comprise most of the remainder of 
Brazil's populations, never have had a real say in their country's fate. Even 
the government's grand scheme to build a Trans-Amazonian highway and other 
roads to provide access to the rain forest, even Brazil's Homestead Act of the 
1970s that granted land to peasants, were cynical projects designed to pacify 
both peasants and forest dwellers (the former could shoot the latter), while 
the real money was in the vast fazendas that cut and burned huge sections of 
forest to facilitate mining or grazing operations. 
</P>
<P>
Without doubt, the trouble in Amazonia is not some simple product of Malthusian 
dynamics. As the authors note, most of the settlement programs of the region 
have failed. But clearly it does have something to do with Brazil's autocratic 
and class-stratified society, and with the vast debts those autocrats have 
incurred with First World banks while sending their own capital abroad. 
</P>
<P>
This is mostly about money and power, not ecological ignorance. Building walls 
around parts of the forest and declaring them ecological sanctuaries, or parks, 
or refuges will not work, has not worked anywhere in the Third World. The new 
civilian government of Jose Sarney has shown some interest in sharing power 
more broadly -- including even those who actually make their homes in the 
forest. Hecht and Cockburn think this is the only answer: Those who live within 
and draw their lives from the forest can be enfranchised to be its best 
protectors, can be aided and encouraged to preserve its spectacular biotic 
treasure. 
</P>
<P>
The tropical forests may or may not be the salvation of the Earth, but they are 
clearly extraordinary biological communities. Because their solar energy, 
moisture and climatic stability are ideal for life, these places support not 
only the highest biomass, but through biological competition the most diversity 
on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
It is no accident that tropical rain forests are the primary source of new 
pharmaceuticals and other biochemicals, as well as genes for all manner of 
enterprises -- these are all the consequence of fierce biological competition 
sustained over millions of years of natural selection. They are also a vast 
pool of carbon that, converted to gas, will cook the Earth while eliminating 
its capacity to recover. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fate of the Forest" is in the hands of the developed world. Our insatiable 
consumption of raw resources -- especially wood pulp and energy -- is the 
principal engine driving tropical deforestation. 
</P>
<P>
Hecht and Cockburn make a potent case that rock concerts and debt exchanges 
have little to do with saving Amazonia; they merely reflect our shallow 
understanding of global economics. We can trim our own resource gluttony and 
the extravagant standard of living that makes our protestations to the Third 
World ring hollow, and we can invest in conservative technologies that will not 
only reduce our own consumption, but which we can share with the tropics.

"Wild Things" brought back a flood of memories of one of our most enjoyable and 
memorable pets: Josh, a black crow my father snuck home one day without my 
mother knowing about it. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few months, Josh had his own "house" a makeshift cage set in our 
backyard. 
</P>
<P>
He would wake us up at 5:30 cawing for food, so Dad would throw out frozen 
balls of cheap hamburger to shut him up and keep him busy. After a while, he 
learned to say "Mama" -- from my sister and me yelling to our mother -- and 
"hi" from my sister's patient efforts. He would wait for my sister to come home 
from school: That was time for him to play. He would "smoke" a bubble pipe for 
her, put a pen in his mouth and scribble on paper and, in the summer, look for 
a few bare toes to peck at. 
</P>
<P>
After Josh's wings grew back (we had clipped them) he would fly overhead and 
race the neighborhood kids on their bikes. Most of them were very gentle with 
him; some weren't. The kids on the next block threw dirt clods with rocks in 
them, and when he had enough of it, he would dive bomb them in return. One day, 
he did it to the wrong child, and she (his mother) came over threatening to 
shoot him next time she saw him. So the Fish and Game Department had to come 
and take him away up to the mountains. We wonder whatever happened to him.

HOISTING ANOTHER BY HER OWN PETARD; 
</P>
<P>
THE JOURNALIST AND THE MURDERER BY JANET MALCOLM (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $18.95; 162 
PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Rieff, Rieff is a free-lance writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some years ago, Joan Didion ended ne of her most famous essays -- a piece that 
all her admirers remember, and, fortunately, that few of her subjects 
subsequently took to heart -- with this gaunt, defiant coda: "Writers," she 
warned, "are always selling somebody out." 
</P>
<P>
At times, Janet Malcolm's brilliant and discomfiting new book, "The Journalist 
and the Murderer," is an attempt to graft flesh onto the bones of that remark. 
Her formulation is, if anything, even more stark than Didion's. "Every 
journalist," she writes, "who is not too stupid or too full of himself to 
notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible. He is 
a kind of confidence man, preying on people's vanity, ignorance or loneliness, 
gaining their trust and betraying them without remorse. . . . Journalists 
justify their treachery in various ways according to their temperaments. The 
more pompous talk about freedom of speech and 'the public's right to know'; the 
least talented talk about Art; the seemliest murmur about earning a living." 
</P>
<P>
Hard pounding, this, as the Duke of Wellington remarked at Waterloo. There is 
harder to come. In Malcolm's account, the relationship between journalist and 
subject is inevitably one of seduction and betrayal. All the rest is wishful 
thinking on the subject's part, duplicity on the journalist's. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing for a wronged subject to do, Malcolm suggests, after what she 
calls his inevitable "dehoaxing," is to consign the experience "to the rubbish 
heap of love affairs that ended badly." The worst thing is to sue. But, of 
course, it is precisely the subject who can't let go and the writer who denies 
his perfidy that engages Malcolm. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald, a former Green Beret captain then serving three 
consecutive life sentences for the murders of his wife and two young children, 
sued Joe McGinniss, the author of a best-selling account of the case called 
"Fatal Vision." MacDonald claimed that he had only cooperated with McGinniss -- 
cooperation so unstinting that at times during his several trials he had 
treated McGinniss more like a member of his defense team than like a journalist 
-- because the writer had asserted an unshakeable faith in his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, MacDonald's lawyer, Gary Bostwick, maintained, was "a case about a 
false friend." For in between 1979, when he first approached MacDonald, and 
1984, when the book appeared, McGinniss had become convinced that his subject 
was indeed a murderer. What made this change of heart bad faith was that after 
McGinniss had changed his mind, and was telling his publishers that "Fatal 
Vision" would portray the doctor as a killer, he continued to insist to 
MacDonald, even after the guilty verdict had come in, that he still thought the 
charges were false. 
</P>
<P>
For Malcolm, the case of MacDonald v. McGinniss "was unprecedented in being 
concerned with a writer's personal conduct toward his subject," an opportunity 
to explore not only the moral ambiguity of journalism but what she regards as 
its essentially authoritarian nature. Approached by one of his lawyers, who 
wrote of the "grave threat to journalistic freedoms" that the case posed, 
Malcolm went to see McGinniss hoping, as she puts it rather too grandly, that 
their conversations would be like that of two experimenters "strolling home 
from the lab together after a day's work, companionably thrashing out the 
problems of the profession." Instead of finding a co-experimenter, however, 
Malcolm encountered another masochistic subject. McGinniss, she writes, with 
the brooding contempt that marked her portrait of him throughout the book, 
insisted that "we play the old game of Confession." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the subject of "The Journalist and the Murderer" is writing, not 
crime. Nevertheless, Malcolm's portrait of McGinniss is so damning and her 
portrait of MacDonald so noncommittal that one sometimes has to wonder about an 
approach in which a writer's dishonesty is treated with more heat than the 
murder of three human beings. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm has always had a taste for demolition. As McGinniss' defenders pointed 
out when the book first appeared as a series of articles in The New Yorker, 
when she talked about journalism as an ethically ambiguous activity she might 
have been thinking less of MacDonald v. McGinniss than of Masson v. Malcolm. A 
few years earlier, Malcolm herself had been sued by Jeffrey Masson, the former 
curator of the Freud archives whose character and competence she had 
effectively demolished in another series of brilliant New Yorker pieces. The 
piece on McGinniss, her critics insisted, was more an elaborate rationalization 
of what she had done to poor Masson than a truthful account either of McGinniss 
or of journalism. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm relies so heavily on psychotherapeutic, and usually rather rigidly 
Freudian, explanations for people's behavior that she should not have been 
surprised when this rather dubious weapon was turned against her. In her 
afterword (there was no mention of Masson in the body of the text), Malcolm 
denies the connection. Readers will judge for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, however, the question may be irrelevant to the book's quality, if 
not to its author's motivations. Like all of Malcolm's best work, "The 
Journalist and the Murderer" is an attack, and what McGinniss and Masson really 
have in common is that they have been well and truly skewered by a writer as 
pitiless as she is talented. 
</P>
<P>
Her masterpieces of severity will, as her subjects must know, endure long after 
their own work is forgotten. Indeed, the only recent piece of Malcolm's that 
was a disappointment was her admiring portrait of Ingrid Sischy, the former 
editor of Art Forum magazine. She is not at her best when she is being kind, a 
fact she seems to acknowledge when she writes that "I, too, have committed the 
journalistic solecism of putting a person's feelings above a text's 
necessities." 
</P>
<P>
The limitation of the book is not that it is wrong but that, whatever she may 
claim, Malcolm's subject is really not journalism at all. Malcolm affects to 
misunderstand the hostility with which her articles were received by working 
journalists, but the explanation is obvious. A reporter covering the START 
talks or Mandela's release may have an ego as big as all outdoors, but his 
principal relation to his subject is neither of seducer nor of exploiter. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Malcolm's casting of the journalist in the position of authority and 
the subject in that of the victim ignores all those examples of the journalist 
as the tame and obedient creature of the powers that be. Think of the free ride 
the press gave John F. Kennedy, or Ronald Reagan during his first six years in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, although Malcolm condescends to the notion of the journalist as 
artist, preposterously arguing that writing is best thought of as a way to make 
a living (why not go to law school then? The money's better and the work 
exercises some of the same abilities), her jeremiad, at once so self-lacerating 
and so curiously complacent, applies not to working journalists, filing every 
day to deadline, but to writers like herself who produce long articles or books 
on subjects of their own choosing according to schedules, the money permitting, 
of their own devising, writers whose points of view are as important as their 
subject matter: in short, artists. 
</P>
<P>
For it is not with regard to journalism but with regard to the making of works 
of art that Malcolm's important book gathers its inspiration, its breathtaking 
rhetorical velocity, and its great truth.

I was charmed by a family of opossums that lived in the brush near my home and 
visited often. These episodes were totally riveting to my dog who, nose pressed 
to the back sliding glass door, waited for their arrival. 
</P>
<P>
A few days passed with no sightings. Apparently the brush had been cleared, 
and, unfortunately, I found the mother opossum dead in my garden shed. My 
depression about her death was quite real. In a high-tech world of concrete and 
glass, this little family of wild beasties reminded me of my country upbringing 
and the loss society suffers from distancing ourselves/itself from nature. So 
many people never experience a natural environment, see a wild river or 
mountain or glimpse an animal in its natural habitat. We, thus, lose part of 
our soul focused as we are on materialism and consumerism. It's good to be 
reminded that we are part of something larger than ourselves. The oppossums 
came back in time, and, I and my dog, are very happy that they are.

I am privileged to care for 12 different animals, nine of which are California 
desert tortoises. I understand why Jordan would not include these -- they are 
not considered wild things living among us. 
</P>
<P>
But you'd be surprised at how many people think tortoises can fend for 
themselves. Many are left out in yards with no shelter. Many tortoises are left 
behind when their owners move. Probably 80% do not receive the nutrition they 
need because people think "all they eat is lettuce." Often, when left to roam 
free, they are hit by cars or, worse yet, they sometimes are eaten by dogs and 
other animals. 
</P>
<P>
The most common comment is that they come from the desert where it's hot during 
the day and freezing at night so tortoises must like it that way. We often find 
people taking their tortoises back to the desert in a gesture of kindness. I 
would attempt to educate these people as to the fact that a domesticated 
tortoise cannot make it in the desert any more than a dog could make it in the 
forest. I know that people also drop off dogs to fend for themslves.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: BOOMER: RAILROAD MEMOIRS BY LINDA NIEMANN (UNIVERSITY OF

Linda Niemann had come close to hitting bottom when she saw an employment 
notice calling for brakemen on the Southern Pacific Railroad. A dropout from 
the academic life, she had sunk to calling herself a musician while "what money 
there was" came from dealing drugs, and that money mostly went on drugs and 
alcohol. One of the first women to sign up for the physically demanding work, 
Niemann saw railroading as a way to force herself to sink or swim: "By doing 
work this dangerous, I would have made a decision to live." 
</P>
<P>
Her harrowing initiation took place in the switching yard at Watsonville, 
Calif., through which passed all perishable freight from the "salad bowl" of 
America. Like Niemann, the reader is thrown into the middle of railroading, 
colorful technical terms flying in every direction with no attempted 
explanation. After all, Niemann writes, the "old heads" never try to explain 
anything to the beginners in words; the work is physical. Railroading work can 
be learned only with the body, so let the terms for the heavy iron pieces sink 
in as the muscles to work them harden. 
</P>
<P>
Little did Niemann realize that her initiation was the softest imaginable. As 
she travels around the country -- a "boomer" following the work as rush periods 
succeed one another in various railroad yards -- she sees all manner of work, 
from the hell of Texas at the end of the oil boom to the petrochemical cesspool 
of the Strang yard, where trains called "bombs" are made up, named for the 
hazardous materials they carry. Hers becomes a world peopled by characters with 
nicknames like Cadillac and Wrong Way. 
</P>
<P>
The most appealing parts of "Boomer" are the tough passages describing hard 
realities of life on the rails, written in a hardboiled-detective style ("A 
coffee cup sat there with a quarter-inch of what looked like diesel fuel in it. 
I guessed that is was cold and that he would probably drink it anyway"). Less 
engaging are Niemann's discussions of dreams, wrestling matches with her 
sexuality and observations on Woody Guthrie's "Bound for Glory." But as an 
antidote for a wasted cerebral life, railroading was just what the doctor 
ordered for Niemann, and paradoxically with many words, she manages to convey 
to the reader a sense of redemption through physical labor.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL VILLAGE BY FRANCES AND JOSEPH GIES

<TEXT>
<P>
In this latest installment of the Gies' study of medieval life (their previous 
books include "Life in a Medieval Castle" and "Life in a Medieval City"), the 
couple focuses on the English village of Elton. Using histories, material from 
archives and recent excavations at the town 70 miles outside of London, they 
piece together an account of daily life as it was experienced by a 13th-Century 
peasant. 
</P>
<P>
Their extremely detailed research takes up in turn food, clothing, farm tools, 
marriage customs, prayer, games -- in short, all conceivable threads in the 
fabric of village life. One stereotype the authors seek to explode for the lay 
reader is that an agricultural society is simple. An extremely complex system 
of social obligations and legal entanglements held every man, woman and child 
in its web, from lord to the lowest serf. 
</P>
<P>
The simple and logical organization of the material -- together with the lively 
illustrations taken from manuscript illumination, woodcuts, tapestry -- makes 
"Life in a Medieval Village" a good general introduction to the history of this 
period; unfortunately, the Gies' style is a little too dry to recommend to 
teen-agers, who would be an ideal audience.

GOATSONG: A NOVEL OF ANCIENT ATHENS BY TOM HOLT (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: $16.95; 
247 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Fred S. Holley, Holley is the compiler of the Los Angeles Times Stylebook. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hero/narrator of "Goatsong" is Eupolis of Pallene, a "Comic playwright," he 
tells us, with a capital C, in ancient Athens, the Athens of Pericles and Cleon 
and Alcibiades, of Socrates and Euripides and Aristophanes, who is likewise a 
Comic playwright. 
</P>
<P>
Eupolis was a goatherd as a youngster, and he continues to have a warm feeling 
for the countryside as opposed to urban, downtown Athens. His accounts of his 
early years, of his experiments with play writing, of how the plague struck his 
family, of how he met and married Phaedra, of how he was "drafted" into the 
military on his wedding day and of how he returned to a career in the theater 
are tongue-in-cheek. 
</P>
<P>
The novel is a funny one but not funny ha-ha, except in a few set-pieces, such 
as the lack of success of his first play and the misadventures of his wedding 
night, which ends with his telling his bride, "And the hell with you too!" 
</P>
<P>
He recalls being advised: "If ever you want to be a Comic poet -- God forbid, 
it's a really rotten life, I'm telling you -- find yourself someone to hate, 
and hate them as much as you possibly can." 
</P>
<P>
He discovers that "all my family and household had died without letting me 
know" and that "bad news takes at least a day to sink in properly." There is 
more truth than humor in much of this, to be sure, as there is in his reference 
to "the urban industries, like sitting on juries, metalwork and burglary." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, he considers the Athenians' lack of interest in history: "I 
suppose this is because we Athenians make all the history in Greece, and just 
as you find that a weaver's cloak is threadbare and worn and a potter's house 
is full of chipped and unglazed pottery, so we Athenians are most disdainful of 
our own principal export and take no great interest in it." 
</P>
<P>
Eupolis offers us an acidly pointed account of the Persian and Peloponnesian 
wars and the Athenian imperialism, perpetrated, he says, to solve unemployment 
problems. The government of Athens, we are told, was "the most pure and perfect 
democracy the world had ever seen, in which every man had a right to be heard, 
the law was open to all, and nobody need go hungry if he was not too proud to 
play his part in the oppression of his fellow Greeks. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
There is wit here, clever, barbed, irreverent wit. "Any fool," Eupolis says, 
"can be a Tragedian. It takes courage to compose Comedy." And much of it has a 
20th-Century reader nodding in grimly amused agreement. Even the more or less 
lighthearted quarrels of Eupolis and Phaedra have a sour resemblance to today's 
domestic disputes. 
</P>
<P>
If you doubt the 20th-Century context, listen to Aristophanes' parting remark 
after a chat in the street: "Is that the time? I've got to run." What clock or 
watch was he looking at?

STATION-SWAPPING, AUTOMATION AND OTHER SEDUCTIVE FANTASIES OF RADIO RICHES

<P>
NOW THAT THE Berbers have been talked, or coerced, into settling down, the only 
true nomads left are radio people. For every Robert W. Morgan or Gary Owens who 
finds a sinecure in a big city, there are thousands of "pieces of talent" 
crisscrossing the continent, being Jim Christopher on Lite 107 in Memphis one 
month and Chris James on Power 93 in Seattle the next. Oddly enough, there can 
be big money in this life: There are radio guys pulling down a yearly million, 
just for spending four hours a day telling the traffic-report lady that she 
should shave her legs more often. But even these fellows lease more often than 
they buy. 
</P>
<P>
The last thing you might think this little world needs is another jolt of 
instability. But the deregulating Reaganistas abolished the requirement that 
radio licenses be held for at least three years following a change of 
ownership. Accordingly, people began to trade stations more briskly than rookie 
Mickey Mantles at a baseball card convention. Prices skyrocketed since, hey, 
each buyer had to make a decent killing when, six weeks down the line, he 
became a seller. 
</P>
<P>
Thus it was that KFAC, a station that earned a few million dollars' profit each 
year playing classical music, got sold twice in five years. Could Mozart draw 
enough people to induce advertisers to pay high enough rates to enable the new 
owners to cover the stupendous debt in which they were bathing? No way, Bizet. 
</P>
<P>
We were now a big city without a commercial classical music station. The 
retooled KFAC, stripped of its embarrassing call letters and decked out in a 
rock format direct from market research, plummeted downward in the ratings 
faster than a wayward Wallenda. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the kind of marketplace magic that the Czechs and Poles might 
well study, other stations began to perform cosmetic surgery on themselves. A 
Valley station that had featured "roots" country music (not the slick Nashville 
sound) went classical. Then the jazz station migrated to the AM band, so saxes 
now have to honk through static to be heard, while its former FM home became -- 
how cultural can a wasteland be? -- classical. 
</P>
<P>
At this point in the square dance, the totals are these: Net increase in 
classical stations: 1. Net increase in rock stations: 1. Net decrease in roots 
country stations: 1. 
</P>
<P>
Unhappy Hank Williams fans have been writing to the local weeklies about 
conspiracies of the well-heeled to perpetuate the "music of a dead European 
aristocracy." Otherwise, the invisible hand just stirs the soup faster than 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
The old KFAC was no audio Acropolis. I grew up in a family where it was the 
house station. I even got my boyhood haircuts in a barbershop three doors away 
from the studios where KFAC's announcers vied with the tenors to see who could 
vocalize more fulsomely and at greater length. It became even more unlistenable 
when it joined the rush to automate. 
</P>
<P>
What rampant station-swapping is today, automation was to an earlier era: a 
seductive fantasy of radio riches. You bought a roomful of expensive equipment, 
almost sophisticated enough for the task at hand. You then gave half your staff 
their walking papers and put the other half to work making tapes that would 
simulate the sound of someone actually sitting at a radio station playing 
music. These tapes, combined with tapes of the music, were computerized, 
randomized, customized and, presumably, listenerized. 
</P>
<P>
It was a great idea, as long as you didn't have ears. The systems always 
suffered from odd pauses, hisses and time announcements that you could sing 
along with because the same little pieces of tape were replayed every day. 
KRLA, where I worked for a spell, set the standard for bad automation. Every 
day, the "air personalities" (the approved euphemism of the day) would take 
their turns taping intros and -- there is no other word -- outros to records, 
never hearing the music, always trying desperately to sound spontaneous. At its 
best, deejay chatter spoils faster than raw cream. This stuff sounded as if it 
had been left out in the sun all day. 
</P>
<P>
The point of the automation fantasy was not just to send some talent back into 
the nomadic herd; it was to develop programming that poorer, smaller stations 
across the country could buy, thereby unemploying their talent as well. That 
noble goal had to wait for satellite technology before it could be fully 
realized. In the old days, a cumbersome array of tape machines sent 
dog-hearing-level electronic signals to each other to manufacture a simulation 
of liveness. Now, a real guy sits in a real studio in Dallas and plays music, 
and people from Cairo, Ill., to Chico, Calif., listening to him at the exact 
same moment, bask in the comforting illusion that he's just down the block. 
</P>
<P>
Big-city radio, of course, is above such amiable subterfuge. Our stations have 
big talents, big budgets -- and big debts. And the last entrant in the 
station-swapping daisy chain may wind up like the thrift industry, facing a 
brisk little chapter by the name of Eleven. But whoever tumbles into bankruptcy 
first can console himself with the knowledge that there's a roots country 
format waiting just on the other side.

This agreeable, if not particularly scholarly, lexicon offers interesting 
accounts of the origins of some slang phrases and terms, including a few 
four-letter ones. How many people who put quarters in jukeboxes know the name 
is derived from juke, a house of ill repute, which comes (via Gullah) from the 
Wolof West Africa word dzug, to misconduct oneself? The etymologies of common 
words are more mundane and lack proper citations. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's fun to discover that the term intestinal fortitude was coined as a 
euphemism for guts by Ohio State football coach John Wilce to counter the 
rugged language he heard in the locker room. If he considered "guts" improper, 
the good coach probably would have a heart attack if he overheard the 
conversations in a modern locker room.

<P>
A MYSTERIOUS, SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED VIRUS THREATENS TO TRIGGER A NEW EPIDEMIC

<P>
THERE IS SOMETHING pure and innocent about Patty and Victor Vurpillat. She was 
18 and he was 19 when they met in 1988. They fell in love. She moved in. Within 
10 months, they were married. Everybody freaked, as Victor tells it; it was 
like the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
The newlyweds found a sunny little apartment in Pacific Palisades. She stocked 
the refrigerator with health food and began training for a marathon. He 
enrolled at Santa Monica College, bringing home A's and Bs. Conversation turned 
to babies. 
</P>
<P>
But then Patty and Victor came down with a most un-1950s disease -- a condition 
fraught with all the uneasiness of sexual relations in the age of AIDS, caused 
by a virus with disturbing links to cancer that threatens to become the 
venereal disease of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
It all started with some bumps on Patty's cervix. Genital warts, the 
nurse-practitioner at the clinic pronounced them. A closer examination turned 
up an area of abnormal tissue. The clinic recommended a biopsy to check for 
signs of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly Patty was on her back with a microscope perched between her thighs. A 
nurse peered in and snipped away at her insides. Later, Patty returned to have 
the warts frozen off. It was creepy: She could feel her cervix defrost. 
</P>
<P>
Victor, too, had to be vetted. There he lay, in a women's clinic, surrounded by 
women. They put his feet up in stirrups; there were little mittens on the 
stirrups. Two nurses set about removing tiny warts, one by one. 
</P>
<P>
Back at home, panic colored Patty's thoughts: She would get cancer; she would 
have a hysterectomy; there would never be any children. She tried reminding 
herself that the risk was small. But fear ached in her gut. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just awful -- not knowing what's going on with your body and if you're 
going to be OK or not," she said recently. "There's a certain percent chance 
you're going to be all right. But then, maybe you're not." 
</P>
<P>
Patty and Victor Vurpillat are infected with a strain of human papilloma virus 
-- HPV -- the virus that lurks behind one of the country's fastest-spreading 
sexually transmitted diseases and is rapidly becoming a prime suspect in the 
search for the causes of cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
As much as 15% of the population may already be carrying the virus -- a fact 
that many health officials view with alarm. It is estimated that 750,000 people 
become infected every year -- most of them teen-agers and young adults who are 
healthy, sexually active and entering their peak reproductive years. 
</P>
<P>
For most of them, HPV infection will mean nothing more than a frustrating 
struggle with the virus's most common visible symptom, genital warts -- small, 
cauliflower-like growths that usually can be removed with various disconcerting 
and less-than-perfect treatments. 
</P>
<P>
But, for a few, HPV may contribute to a profoundly disturbing form of cancer -- 
cancer of the genitals, and in particular, cervical cancer, a condition that 
threatens the core of one's sexuality, the ability to reproduce and, 
occasionally, life itself. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty is, it is impossible to predict who will fall into which group. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, millions of Americans find themselves condemned to a sentence of 
life beneath the cloud of HPV, carrying in their tissues an incurable and 
highly infectious virus that may eventually unleash a devastating cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The burden falls especially hard on women. Both sexes can carry and spread the 
virus, but symptoms are more pronounced in women. Although the virus has been 
associated with cancers of the penis and anus, the greater risk appears to be 
cancer of the cervix. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, some people are spreading the virus unknowingly: It is transmitted 
by contact with warts, and warts often go unnoticed. Some physicians suspect 
that HPV may even occasionally be spread indirectly -- perhaps on a tanning 
bed, toilet or washcloth. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, it may not be possible to protect oneself completely. 
Physicians strongly recommend condoms. But they acknowledge that even condoms 
are not foolproof; some warts remain exposed, and contact can occur before or 
after the condom is used. 
</P>
<P>
What are the long-term implications of the spread of such a virus? 
</P>
<P>
Many researchers insist that HPV is unlikely to produce a significant increase 
in the number of deaths from invasive cervical cancer in the United States, 
because cervical cancer is highly treatable and, in most cases, even 
preventable if women are screened regularly. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some have noticed a worrisome trend -- an apparent rise in the 
incidence of cervical dysplasia, abnormalities in the cells on the surface of 
the cervix that, although treatable, in some cases turn out to be antecedents 
of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Some physicians also have reported an increase in adenocarcinomas, a 
particularly nasty subset of cervical tumors. Those tumors now seem to strike 
younger women in particular, researchers say; and they may be especially 
difficult to detect early and cure. 
</P>
<P>
Both of those trends, which some researchers believe may be linked to HPV, 
suggest a startling shift in the demographics of cervical cancer: A disease 
that in the past has afflicted mostly women in their late 40s and beyond is now 
threatening women in their prime. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that the teen-age cervix is phenomenally sensitive, in that there 
is a tremendous amount of cell division," says Dr. Stephen L. Curry of Tufts 
University. "If they are exposed to whatever carcinogens there are, there will 
be a higher incidence of cancer." 
</P>
<P>
Even more troubling is the fact that as many as half of all women in the United 
States don't undergo annual cervical cancer screening, without which it is 
impossible to detect and treat the cancer's precursors, staving off more 
serious disease. 
</P>
<P>
At a large public-health clinic near downtown Los Angeles that serves mostly 
low-income Latinos, women are turning up with the earliest stages of cervical 
cancer at twice the national rate, and their average age is just 24. 
</P>
<P>
HPV infection is rampant among her clients, says Catherine Wylie, who oversees 
the family-planning program at the H. Claude Hudson Comprehensive Health Center 
at Adams Boulevard and South Grand Avenue. The spread will continue, she says, 
until the law requires that partners of people who have HPV be tracked down and 
treated. 
</P>
<P>
"Our women have sex early because they marry at 16 to 18," Wylie said recently. 
"As long as this disease is not reportable, and there's no partner follow-up 
and treatment, I think we're going to have an epidemic of cervical cancer." 
</P>
<P>
THERE IS NOTHING new about warts -- on the genitals or elsewhere. They have 
been around for millennia. As early as the 1st Century AD, physicians described 
the more ignominious form -- warts on the genitals and anus, also known as 
condylomata. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not known until this century that warts came from viruses -- a 
specific family of viruses called human papilloma viruses. (It is now known 
that some strains cause common warts on the hands and feet and other strains 
cause genital warts.) 
</P>
<P>
That discovery led next to an intriguing glimpse of HPV's mysterious links to 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1930s, researchers discovered that a form of papilloma virus 
caused benign tumors (also known as papillomas) in cottontail rabbits. When 
exposed to certain chemicals that were otherwise innocuous, those tumors 
quickly turned malignant. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, those initial animal experiments remain a model for examining the 
way papilloma virus-induced abnormalities can progress to cancer, researchers 
say. But the links between HPV and human cancers would remain unrecognized for 
another 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, it became clear how HPV is spread. 
</P>
<P>
The first report of sexual transmission of HPV came in 1954. Twenty-four women 
came down with genital warts after their husbands returned from the Far East. 
All 24 husbands admitted to having had sex overseas, and all had recently had 
penile warts. 
</P>
<P>
Sex with a partner who has untreated warts is known now to be extremely risky, 
since the virus is highly concentrated in warts. In studies, most partners of 
people with warts developed warts themselves within weeks or months. Cuts and 
abrasions appear to increase one's infection with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
There is at least one other form of transmission: HPV can be spread to an 
infant during childbirth. In rare cases, the infection produces a 
life-threatening condition in which warts on the infant's larynx interfere with 
his or her ability to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
And because physicians have seen instances of HPV spreading in cases in which 
no sexual contact is believed to have occurred -- for instance, among 
non-intimate members of the same household -- some wonder whether HPV is spread 
in other ways. Those cases, however, are difficult to prove. 
</P>
<P>
By whatever routes, genital warts began proliferating in the 1960s under the 
influence of increased sexual freedom and declining use of barrier 
contraceptives. Statistics on visits to U.S. physicians indicate a 12-fold 
increase in cases in just 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Disease and Therapeutic Index, the number of visits 
for treatment of genital warts leaped from 160,000 in 1966 to 1 million just a 
decade later. By 1988, that number had reached 1.2 million. In the meantime, 
HPV research languished, in part because of an obstacle that has yet to be 
overcome. Scientists had never managed to grow HPV in the laboratory, making it 
difficult to study its transmission, its treatment and how the virus affects 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
Then in the mid-1970s, a pathologist working in a laboratory in Canada began 
noticing a peculiar pattern under his microscope: He found striking 
similarities between cells from genital warts and cells from pre-malignant 
lesions on the cervix. 
</P>
<P>
The pathologist, Alexander Meisels, a professor at Quebec's LaVal University, 
was intrigued by two features in particular. The cells he was studying seemed 
to have in common an unusual cavity around the nucleus and an overabundance of 
a protein called keratin. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, it dawned on Meisels: The lesions must have come from the same source 
as the warts. If HPV caused not just warts but cervical lesions as well, and 
lesions were known in some cases to develop into cancer, then HPV had a role in 
the process leading to cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"The cells seem to have to be infected (with HPV) first," says Meisels, who is 
also head of the department of pathology and cytology at Saint-Sacrement 
Hospital. "But that is not sufficient. Something else is acting on them." 
</P>
<P>
Cervical cancer has long been thought to be caused at least in part by a 
sexually transmitted infectious agent. Among the most important risk factors 
for the disease is simply the number of sexual partners a woman has had and the 
number of partners her partner has had. 
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, cervical cancer is a top cancer killer. Half a million women come 
down with it annually. Half of those women will die within 2 1/2 years, mostly 
in countries with poor access to health care and inadequate cervical cancer 
screening. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the death rate has plummeted since the Papanicolaou smear 
made it possible to identify and treat the precursors of cervical cancer. This 
year, there will be about 13,500 new cases of invasive cancer and 6,000 deaths 
-- down nearly 70% since the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, some researchers are worried by recent reports of an increase in the 
especially virulent adenocarcinomas -- an apparent rise that some believe may 
come from a sexually transmitted infectious agent, perhaps HPV. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, this particularly aggressive type of tumor made up just 5% of 
all invasive cervical cancers. Now that figure is 30%, says Dr. Alex Ferenczy, 
a professor of pathology and obstetrics and gynecology at McGill University in 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
There are also signs that invasive cancer is striking at a younger age. 
According to Ferenczy, 22% of all invasive cancers in developed countries are 
now diagnosed in women aged 35 and younger. That figure is up from less than 
10% just 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a heavy-duty increase," Ferenczy says. "This has major clinical 
implications for whoever screens women for cervical cancers. They have to 
remember that invasive cancer is no longer and not necessarily a disease for 
elderly women." 
</P>
<P>
THAT LESSON is not lost on Dr. Louise H. Connolly, medical director of the 
Manhattan Beach Women's Health Center, a full-service medical clinic operated 
by Centinela Hospital on a busy South Bay thoroughfare a few miles from the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Yale Medical School, Connolly opted for a career in obstetrics 
and gynecology. What appealed to her was the possibility of practicing 
preventive medicine -- as she puts it, protecting a woman's right to sexuality 
without harmful consequences. 
</P>
<P>
But these days, harmful consequences walk into the office every day. About one 
in five of Connolly's patients is infected with HPV. The average age of those 
women, Connolly figures, is 22. News of the diagnosis, and the risk of cancer, 
comes as a rude shock. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're 18 to 25, you feel that your health is guaranteed. You feel 
invulnerable to major disease," Connolly says. "I think initially they're 
shocked and frightened that they're 18 or 20 years old and they have something 
that might lead to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Right behind that, they feel they have a sexually transmitted disease and they 
may feel dirty," she added. "So it's fear and shame together. It cuts them off 
from asking people for support -- from family, boyfriends and friends." 
</P>
<P>
One woman, who asked to be identified simply as Annie, was in her mid-40s when 
she discovered that she had genital warts. She was divorced at the time, 
sexually active and in a relationship with a man she has since married. 
</P>
<P>
Annie had no gynecologist, so she told her family doctor. For a year and a 
half, they fought a losing battle against the warts. Annie would go in for 
treatment with various ointments, the warts would disappear, and within several 
months they would be back. 
</P>
<P>
"It's emotionally painful and it's demeaning," Annie says. "You've got a 
sexually transmitted disease and someone is fooling with your bottom. And to be 
honest, one of the hardest parts about the whole thing was my husband's lack of 
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
"He just didn't understand what I was going through emotionally," she says. "It 
was more like an imposition to him. He'd see me going for another treatment and 
he'd think, 'She's going to be out of commission for a week.' " 
</P>
<P>
After eight or 10 episodes, even the physician was becoming impatient. So when 
the next wart arrived, Annie went to see Connolly. "When she examined me, she 
said, 'This is not a wart,' " Annie recalls. " 'It's something else, and I want 
to remove it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Connolly cut off the growth and sent it in for a biopsy. The results came back: 
Annie had early cancer of the vulva. (Vulval cancer is another genital cancer 
that has been linked to HPV but is less common than cervical cancer.) 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Annie's cancer was at its earliest stage. It was confined to the 
top layer of the skin and could be cut off easily. Simply removing it and a 
surrounding margin of normal tissue for a pathologist's scrutiny would probably 
be sufficient treatment. 
</P>
<P>
But Connolly had Annie return for colposcopy, an extensive internal examination 
with a binocular microscope that magnifies and illuminates the vagina and 
cervix. Through the scope, Connolly would be able to detect any warts or more 
troubling changes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was horrible, just horrible," Annie remembers, referring to her fear of 
what Connolly might find. "There you are, spread-eagle, for (nearly half) an 
hour. None of it really hurts. . . . But every time she'd stop and look at 
something, I'd think, 'Oh God, oh God, oh God.' " 
</P>
<P>
HPV infection contributes to a range of manifestations in women. They fall 
along a continuum from barely significant to severe. Some people suffer no 
symptoms, some suffer just one. Others proceed at varying rates of speed from 
one to the next. 
</P>
<P>
The least serious are warts and so-called subclinical infections -- barely 
perceptible changes in the cells that cover the cervix. A specialist 
scrutinizing cells scraped off during a Pap smear might detect the virus's 
distinctive footprint -- clumps of oddly misshapen cells. 
</P>
<P>
More-extensive cell changes create a condition known as dysplasia, or cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Those abnormalities can be detected through 
Pap smears or colposcopy, where they appear as areas of white tissue where it 
should be smooth and pink. 
</P>
<P>
Dysplasia can range from mild to severe. Many cases will clear up 
spontaneously, some become worse. A small minority seem to advance to become 
carcinoma in situ, an early and highly treatable form of cancer confined to the 
top layer of tissue of the affected organ. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there can be invasive, or malignant, cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Deep in the vastness of Los Angeles County USC Medical Center, Carol Carriere 
peers through a microscope at a small glass slide. Thousands of cells from a 
woman's cervix are smeared on the slide, clustered like dense constellations of 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
Carriere is chief cytotechnologist in the Department of Cytology at County USC. 
Some 30,000 slides pass through her lab every year. Most are from Pap smears, 
and many carry the tell-tale signs that HPV has invaded the cells. 
</P>
<P>
Scanning the slide, Carriere looks for subtle changes -- say, a cell with an 
oversized nucleus or cells in abnormal patterns of clumping. A key tip-off to 
HPV's presence is that enlarged and irregularly shaped nucleus, often 
surrounded by a widening cavity. 
</P>
<P>
In moderation, she says, those changes suggest subclinical infection or warts. 
More extensive abnormalities may indicate pre-malignant cells. 
</P>
<P>
Treatment of HPV-related diseases depends upon the symptoms. There are no drugs 
that can rid the body of the virus, just as there is no vaccine. So physicians 
such as Connolly treat the manifestations: They freeze or vaporize or slice off 
the warts and areas with abnormal cells. 
</P>
<P>
The first line of attack is a variety of chemicals, administered either by the 
patient or physician. For persistent warts and warts on the cervix, many 
physicians use cryosurgery, freezing the wart and surrounding tissue with a 
low-temperature probe. 
</P>
<P>
Another option for extensive warts and dysplasia is laser surgery, in which a 
concentrated beam of light serves as a scalpel. Finally, a so-called cone 
biopsy is occasionally used to slice a cone-shaped chunk of abnormal tissue 
from the cervix. 
</P>
<P>
It is not really known why such approaches work, but they seem to. Many people 
treated for warts and dysplasia never experience a recurrence. By removing a 
repository of virus, the treatments may be diminishing the load of virus in the 
body. Or, they may be triggering an immune response. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there are limitations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that you can't cure a viral infection by burning the skin off," 
says Dr. Kenneth L. Noller, chairman of the department of obstetrics and 
gynecology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. "It would be like 
trying to cure a cold by burning off the lining of the lungs." 
</P>
<P>
Connolly, for one, also prescribes what she discreetly terms "pelvic rest" 
until the warts or areas of dysplasia have been treated and have healed. She 
advises frequent Pap smears -- as often as every three to six months -- a 
repeat colposcopy in a year and examination and treatment of any partners. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them drag their feet," Connolly says. "Some couples break up: She gets 
angry, they have a fight, he leaves." 
</P>
<P>
Genital warts are common in men as well as women. They can occur on the penis, 
anus, scrotum and in the urethra. But they are often less visible than on 
women, noticeable only with close examination. So, many men unknowingly infect 
their partners. 
</P>
<P>
There may also be certain "high-risk males" -- men for whom a succession of 
partners or wives develop cervical cancer. Some researchers have speculated 
that such men are transmitting some carcinogen, probably an infectious agent, 
perhaps a strain of HPV. 
</P>
<P>
Gynecologists say many men's physicians are unfamiliar with HPV infection. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them will just go to their family practitioner, who just eyeballs them 
and says, 'No, you don't have it,' " says Dr. Virginia A. Siegfried of Los 
Angeles. "That may be part of the problem in some of the patients we seem to 
keep getting back again: They're just re-exposed." 
</P>
<P>
"You need a urologist or dermatologist who will go over the entire penis, 
urethra, scrotum and peri-anal area carefully," Connolly says. "They should 
check the opening of the urethra to make sure there isn't one tiny wart sitting 
in there that's going to infect someone." 
</P>
<P>
Nan Singer (not her real name) discovered in her early 30s that her husband had 
warts on his anus. When she asked him about them, he conceded that he had had 
them for seven months. But he had neglected to tell her, and had neglected to 
have them treated. 
</P>
<P>
Even after she confronted him, her husband was reluctant to see a doctor. Then 
he expected Nan to be responsible for seeing that he used the medication, and 
even for administering it. Nan felt betrayed and disgusted; their sexual 
relationship deteriorated. Existing problems in their marriage grew worse. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that shocked me was that he was so uninformed," says Nan, who 
believes her husband's response to the disease contributed significantly to 
their subsequent divorce. "He knew what they were, but he made no effort to 
understand what it could mean to me." 
</P>
<P>
Nan began having Pap smears every four to six months. One after another, they 
came back normal, or Class 1. Then, during one four-month period, the results 
switched suddenly from Class 1 to Class 3, signifying cell changes consistent 
with dysplasia. 
</P>
<P>
Nan's gynecologist recommended laser surgery, a process Nan likens to "taking 
napalm to your insides." She describes her recovery as protracted and painful, 
sloughing off dead tissue for days. The smell seemed so foul, she feared 
co-workers noticed. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Nan nor Annie has had any further problems. But both are familiar with 
their gynecologists' waiting rooms. They go in every few months and have tried 
to make peace with the unsettling knowledge that trouble could surface any 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Nan has become one of those women Connolly set out to protect: She is now a 
veteran of HPV, herpes infection, three ectopic pregnancies and pelvic 
inflammatory disease; but at 34, she remains determined to preserve her ability 
one day to conceive and bear a child. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived with a lot of pain and this bad equipment for years," Nan said 
bitterly one morning recently, in an interview at her home near Los Angeles. "I 
(am not) about to lose it for venereal warts." 
</P>
<P>
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE are as many questions as there are answers about HPV. 
</P>
<P>
Many more people are infected than come down with any visible symptoms. What 
percentage will develop symptoms remains unknown. "People are flipping up 
figures," Ferenczy says. "Probably 5% to 15% will show up with some sort of 
HPV-related disease." 
</P>
<P>
Of those who do, most will develop warts or dysplasia. In many of those, the 
conditions might clear spontaneously if left alone. In a small percentage, HPV 
infection will lead to cancer. What percentage that will be, and who they are, 
is impossible to say. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure now we know what the true risk is to a woman who has HPV 
infection," says Dr. John Curtin, a gynecologic oncologist at the USC School of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The infection can remain hidden for long periods, surfacing at any time. One 
65-year-old woman in Minnesota recently developed genital warts inexplicably, 
leaving her physician, Dr. Leo B. Twiggs, wondering why her symptoms emerged 
when they did. 
</P>
<P>
According to Twiggs, director of the Women's Cancer Center at the University of 
Minnesota Hospital, research suggests that symptoms may surface when a 
patient's immunity is down. Other factors probably cause the immune 
suppression, he says; but maybe the virus can, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the virus is interlocked into the cells, it's like a small computer 
program or a mini-computer hooking into a mainframe," Twiggs says. "The 
question is, where does it sit? Next to what operations systems? What's it 
doing there?" No one really knows what turns the program on. 
</P>
<P>
Another question is one foreshadowed a half-century ago in the initial 
experiments with papilloma virus infection in rabbits: What are the so-called 
co-factors that encourage the progression to cancer? Are there ways women can 
minimize their risk? 
</P>
<P>
One prime suspected co-factor is cigarette smoking. Opinion is divided on oral 
contraceptives. Other possible co-factors include additional infectious agents, 
such as the herpes virus, hormonal influences, genetic background and 
environmental and dietary factors. 
</P>
<P>
The National Cancer Institute is preparing to try to answer the co-factor and 
risk questions with the help of a study of 15,000 to 20,000 women. Researchers 
will track them for several years to determine who among them develops the 
kinds of abnormalities known to precede cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
They will then screen the women for HPV infection and those possible co-factors 
that might have played a role in their symptoms. Thus, researchers hope to be 
better able to predict the consequences of HPV infection and what puts people 
at greatest risk. 
</P>
<P>
"What's certain is if you have an abnormal Pap smear or dysplasia, you are more 
likely to have the virus detected," says Dr. Mark Schiffman of the National 
Cancer Institute. "But if you have HPV today but are normal, does that mean you 
will get an abnormal smear? 
</P>
<P>
"People assume that women with the virus will go on and get dysplasia," 
Schiffman says. "Maybe the answer is no. Maybe most women can fight off the 
virus with their immune system. . . . We are trying to determine for physicians 
and women the meaning of infection." 
</P>
<P>
It is also possible that, in some women, warts and mild dysplasia will 
disappear without treatment. For that reason, there is disagreement among 
physicians about when treatment is warranted and how much difference it makes. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jonathan S. Berek, director of gynecologic oncology at the UCLA School of 
Medicine, believes that some women are being over-treated -- at considerable 
pain and expense and with limited evidence that the therapy really helps. 
</P>
<P>
But other physicians argue that they cannot afford to wait. If even a small 
minority of patients risk developing cancer, they suggest that it would be 
irresponsible to not do everything possible to protect those patients. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we don't have the tools to say which will progress . . . you're almost 
forced to over-treat the others," Connolly says. Furthermore, many patients are 
anxious to be rid of their warts. 
</P>
<P>
There is similar controversy about the value of a new form of HPV testing. 
</P>
<P>
There are now some 60 known strains of the virus. (In 1987, they were being 
identified at a rate of three a month.) Some are found primarily in benign 
warts; some turn up in connection with dysplasia. A few seem to be linked 
primarily to invasive cancers. 
</P>
<P>
But the associations are not hard and fast. 
</P>
<P>
Several companies have developed tests capable of identifying the strain with 
which a person is infected. The first test on the market appeared in the United 
States early last year and is being offered by some commercial labs. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturer suggests that the test be used with the Pap smear to alert 
physicians to the presence of a potentially cancer-causing virus. The company 
claims that once physicians know the strains involved, they can monitor their 
patients accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
But some physicians counter that all patients should be closely monitored 
anyway. They say the association between specific strains and symptoms is not 
yet sufficiently clear to justify alarming, or reassuring, patients on the 
basis of the test. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure how to use it, to tell you the truth," says Siegfried of Los 
Angeles. "It doesn't change how we treat the patients, and I'm concerned that 
it might cause more anxiety if the patients are told they have the type that is 
more closely linked to cancer." 
</P>
<P>
IN THE END, researchers say that panic about HPV is counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
Most people never will develop cervical cancer, they repeatedly point out. The 
disease's antecedents are easily detected and treated. And in most cases, the 
rate of progression is slow enough that a single missed Pap smear will not be 
crucial. 
</P>
<P>
But with nearly half the women in the United States not undergoing regular 
screenings, says Berek of UCLA, attention should be focused on encouraging 
those women to change their lifestyles and get regular checkups. 
</P>
<P>
Berek would like to see more public resources devoted to comprehensive cancer 
screening of all Americans -- an approach he and others point out repeatedly 
has been proven cost-effective but rarely attracts much political support. 
</P>
<P>
"So I think the broader issue here is not so much that we've identified a virus 
that causes warts -- a small proportion of which are virulent and probably are 
associated with the development of genital cancers," Berek says. "The issue is 
who's getting screened and why can't we save those other 6,000 lives?" 
</P>
<P>
But statistics offer little comfort to people such as Patty Vurpillat. 
</P>
<P>
In Patty's case, the warts on her cervix returned within a few months of 
treatment. When the clinic advised a second biopsy, she balked. She feared the 
pain of another biopsy and was losing confidence in the clinic where she was 
being treated. 
</P>
<P>
Unsatisfied and anxious, she sought a second opinion. In December, the new 
physician suggested waiting three months. Warts sometimes regress. If they 
don't go away, the physician said, she might try once more freezing them off. 
</P>
<P>
So these days, Patty Vurpillat is waiting. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been worried," she said sadly one recent afternoon. "It's always in the 
back of your mind: I'm thinking, 'Could something really be messing up my 
reproductive system?' I'm going to turn 20 this week. And I feel like I'm going 
to turn 40."

It's hardly news that Gore Vidal can write brilliantly when he chooses to, and 
some of these essays reveal him at his best. 
</P>
<P>
With frightening clarity, he strips away the patriotic rhetoric of Oliver 
North's defenders and exposes the threat the Iran-Contra affair poses to 
constitutional government in the United States in "Ollie." 
</P>
<P>
Unhappily, Vidal rarely chooses to exercise his formidable talents, preferring 
to fritter away the reader's time with rambling, self-indulgent pieces 
attacking writers he describes with such coy circumlocutions as "Crier From the 
Heart." A very uneven book from an obviously gifted author who seems bent on 
preserving his reputation as America's foremost literary gadfly.

<P>
A ruminative novel about the love and interdependence that bind a taciturn 
farmer and his gregarious wife. When Lila has to undergo surgery for breast 
cancer and arterial blockage, the sophisticated technology of modern medicine 
forces the couple to confront the coldly mechanized world of the '80s, which 
they have managed to keep at arm's length. 
</P>
<P>
Their Kentucky farm has become a retreat to an older time and a mellowed vision 
of agricultural life. But the pain of separation is more wrenching than the 
sense of dislocation. Lila and Spence discover they are lost without each 
other, a fact that their well-meaning children are unable to disguise. Bobbie 
Ann Mason draws a warm portrait of two people joined by an enduring affection, 
tempered by years of conjugal life.

LOOKS: DOWN WITH BUILDUP; 
</P>
<P>
SHAMPOO-SOLUBLE GELS AND SPRAYS MEAN THAT HAIR NO LONGER HAS TO TAKE A 
SHELLACKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
THIS SPRING, teased-hair styles are making a comeback. Reminiscent of former 
First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's bouffants, they are neat and sophisticated. But 
unlike the '60s, a vast assortment of styling products now makes the voluminous 
look possible without the torture of sleeping on wire-mesh rollers or 
back-combing hair into knots. 
</P>
<P>
As convenient, however, as gels, mousses and sprays are in producing desired 
fullness and control, these easy-to-use fixatives also can result in a bad case 
of buildup -- that stubborn residue of waxes, oils and plastics that make hair 
dull, limp, brittle and resistant to dyes and perm solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Avoiding buildup is a challenge, considering that as many as three styling 
products may be necessary to create a hair style. Take, for example, the 
technique of Phillip Wilson, the international artistic director of L'Anza, a 
hair-care-products firm in Irwindale. Wilson first applies a styling product to 
wet hair, then blows it dry, coaxing it under at the ends. Next, he gently 
teases the back for fullness, leaves the sides and top smooth and adds a gel 
for control and extra shine. He finishes with a spray. "Unless you're using 
products that don't build up or you're removing the buildup, your hair will 
eventually droop and lose its natural sheen," Wilson says. 
</P>
<P>
The term buildup was first used in the mid-1970s when balsam additives were all 
the rage. Although balsam initially gave hair a soft and silky look and feel, 
the ingredient formed an unwanted coating on the hair that shampoos couldn't 
dissolve and rinsing couldn't remove. In the days of long and full Farrah 
Fawcett manes, droopy hair was an easy-to-spot aesthetic problem. When women 
recognized that the balsam products were weighing down their hair, they 
switched to other products. 
</P>
<P>
Now that daily shampooing, followed by the application of gels and mousses, is 
a common grooming ritual, buildup is much more difficult to detect. These days, 
products that can cause buildup keep the hair artificially shiny and full; 
thus, dullness and limpness are no longer telltale clues. The only obvious 
signs are extensive breakage, perms that don't take properly, and dyes that 
fade too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a solution. New shampoos that remove buildup are being formulated. 
Neutrogena Shampoo and Dep's Everyday Shampoo dissolve most accumulations of 
waxes and oils. Other deposits, such as those that result from fixatives 
containing plastics and from heavily chlorinated water, are stubborn and demand 
special treatment. Mastey's Le Remouver, Joico's Phine and L'Anza's Pree, all 
products sold in hair salons, are antidotes to buildup that must be massaged 
into the hair before it is shampooed. Once these treatments break down the 
chemical bonds that hold the particles onto the hair shaft -- a process that 
takes from one to five minutes -- the shampoo washes them away. Redken's Hair 
Cleansing Creme is a one-step product that is used like shampoo. 
</P>
<P>
Once buildup is removed, the trick is to keep it from coming back. The labels 
on gels, sprays and mousses usually state which products are shampoo-soluble 
and are thus less likely to result in buildup. Still, how to go about shopping 
based on labels alone has become a matter of some debate. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking for specific ingredients or the absence of specific ingredients is 
useless," says Sharon Hayashi, president of Hayashi For Hair in Valencia. 
"There's no one additive that causes buildup -- it's the combination of 
ingredients." 
</P>
<P>
But Joico president Steve Stefano places the blame on the cheap synthetic 
polymers, or waxy plastics, that, he says, many manufacturers include in their 
shampoos, conditioners and fixatives. "It's expensive to develop a spray with 
just a minimum of polymers -- too expensive for mass-market products," he says. 
"Once those plastics harden, the hair breaks easily." 
</P>
<P>
For people who don't shampoo on a daily basis, other new styling products -- 
such as Hayashi's Gelplus Fixative or Joico's I.C.E. Mist -- need be applied 
only once between washings. They can be reactivated by spritzing the hair with 
water, thus ending the product-on-top-of-product cycle. 
</P>
<P>
The message is, then, that with a little effort, buildup -- once remedied only 
by harsh solvents in salons -- now can be dissolved, or even prevented, at 
home.

'EVERYTHING I DESIGN is for what it does, not for its looks," says Stephan 
Copeland, a 30-year-old Montreal-born industrial designer who moved to L.A. so 
he could windsurf at Venice Beach. Unlike the typical desk lamp comprising 
rigid pieces pivoting on a few hinge points, Copeland's Tango lamp has flexible 
steel cables that move in fluid, "organic" fashion. 
</P>
<P>
The design for the Tango was good enough to land Copeland a contract with Flos, 
the high-style Italian lamp manufacturer (he is the first non-Italian to do 
so). Tango also won the prestigious 1989 Institute of Business Designers Bronze 
Award in the portable-lamp category.

<P>
List prices for the Tango run: $450 for the table base with halogen bulb, $370 
with fluorescent; $320 for the fluorescent clamp model.

DESERT FLOWER BESIDE THE SEA

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AS SAN DIEGO'S largest wildflower puts on a spectacular show this month, it 
delivers a message that global warming is nothing new. From late March into 
May, the Mojave yucca blooms in Torrey Pines State Reserve amid other plants 
from the dry inland desert -- a magical sight to behold in the seaside 
Mediterranean climate. 
</P>
<P>
You can spot the Mojave yucca by its sword-shape leaves edged by curling 
fibers. In spring, it thrusts out an intricate maroon bud spike that swells 
into a luxuriant stalk of creamy, bell-shape blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
Like many a city resident, this yucca is an in-migrant. We know from the fossil 
record that it came from afar to join the rare Torrey pine. Both are residents 
of the reserve because plants move -- that is, their range expands or shrinks 
as climate changes. The pines remain from the last ice age, until perhaps 
10,000 years ago, a cool, moist era when forests blanketed the California coast 
and its offshore islands. The Mojave yucca remains from the next climatic 
episode, a worldwide warming from about 8,000 to 3,000 years ago, at which time 
hot winds decimated coastal forests in all but a few spots like San Diego, 
which were kept mild by the sea. Wind-borne seeds impelled desert plants to the 
future site of San Diego. Six species remain today, with the yucca the star of 
the group. Will these survivors have new meaning if another global warming is 
indeed on the way? WALTER HOUK

Here in Southern California there is another fairly common and thoroughly 
delightful wild creature, the dove. Each year about this time, a pair of doves 
arrives on the balcony of our condo. 
</P>
<P>
They do their billing, cooing and mating on the wrought-iron railing and then 
take up residence in one of our hanging plants. 
</P>
<P>
They bring grass and twigs to make the nest, lay two little eggs and take turns 
sitting. The two tiny hatchlings grow to almost a third of their parents' size 
in about three weeks, thanks to a constant commute by the doves to regurgitate 
food into the babies' open mouths. Then they begin their perilous attempts to 
fly -- from the nest down to the balcony table and chairs or guard rail, and 
then flutter and struggle back to the nest. I ache with sympathetic effort. 
</P>
<P>
And then, some early morning, they will simply be gone, not to return until 
early the next spring. The plant is dead and a mess, what with droppings and 
lice, and we simply chuck it down the chute.

I enjoyed your article "Wild Things." However, I was disappointed by the 
exclusion of squirrels. 
</P>
<P>
As a resident of Los Feliz, I receive occasional visits from skunks, opossums, 
raccoons and coyotes, but my favorite is my squirrel friend who scratches on my 
window to remind me to leave a supply of nuts every morning. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, she is spied upon by a blue jay who follows her and steals most 
of the nuts she buries.

SCAVENGER HUNT

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Linda Deutsch's article about the HumanRace, the around-the-world travel 
adventure contest ("Around the World in a Daze," Jan. 21), was entertaining but 
unfortunately not very accurate. From the beginning, Linda failed to appreciate 
that she had entered a challenging competitive race, not a relaxed tour where 
she could socialize with her correspondent friends. 
</P>
<P>
Realizing after the first day that she didn't have a chance of winning, Linda 
became so caught up in her own anger she failed to see and realize that most of 
the other participants were having a fantastic once-in-a-lifetime experience. 
To say Linda complained is putting it mildly. In spite of herself, Linda 
portrays the HumanRace as a fascinating challenge for the right person.

As participants in the HumanRace, we enjoyed reading your writer's version of 
the so-called "Scavenger Hunt From Hell." Although Linda's experience seems 
atypical of the majority of those who raced around the world last November, 
(her article) was nonetheless enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
As she aptly states, there were real problems and mistakes made by the event's 
organizers; yet we should remember that this was the first event of its kind 
ever attempted and included both logistical and behavioral uncertainties no one 
could have ever anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Linda, we feel, lost sight of the reality that this was indeed a race. Feeling 
rushed, skipping meals and running about screaming at locals were the very 
least of our problems. More to the point, transportation snafus, language 
barriers, along with challenging tasks and resourceful competitors, proved more 
difficult obstacles for us to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it was a hectic race and we did miss out interacting with intriguing 
natives and enjoying beautiful sights along the way. But we entered this 
competition knowing full well that this time around we would only be global 
grazers. A photo op here, a tourist trophy there, and away we went 
participating in a wild and fulfilling cultural experience of a lifetime. 
Whether in first-class hotels or camel caravans through the desert, from 
ancient burial grounds in Indonesia or the Louvre in Paris, we experienced this 
global village of ours like never before imagined. We thoroughly enjoyed it, 
and we'll do it again next year.

POP FACES: CASHING IN ON HER NEW-FOUND CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember Butterfly McQueen, the black actress who played the baby-voiced slave 
in "Gone With the Wind" -- the one who told Miss Scarlett that she knew nothing 
about "birthing" babies? That squeaky little voice wasn't one-of-a-kind after 
all. 
</P>
<P>
It's alive and well in Michel'le, the 19-year-old soul singer who has the rare 
distinction of having her first single, the danceable "No More Lies," ascend to 
the Billboard magazine pop Top 10. The single is pulling her debut album, 
"Michel'le" -- on Ruthless/Atco Records -- up the pop chart. 
</P>
<P>
On first meeting, it's difficult not to be startled by that voice. "I'm used to 
people being surprised at how I talk," said Michel'le (pronounced Mi-shel-AY) 
matter-of-factly the other day during a late afternoon snack in Beverly Hills. 
"People laugh sometimes. When I'm on stage people laugh when they first hear me 
talk. If I'm on the phone, ordering something, people often tell me to have my 
mother come to the phone. They don't believe I'm a grown-up." 
</P>
<P>
Isn't this disconcerting -- even painful? 
</P>
<P>
"Not anymore," she admitted. "It's probably helped make me shy. I was always 
shy when I was growing up. I didn't have a lot of friends. But when I was about 
15, I decided I wasn't going to let the reactions to my voice bother me. Now 
I'm not as shy as I used to be. Getting into singing has helped." 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, her singing voice is totally different -- wide-ranging and 
full-bodied. "I can't explain it," she said, flashing a big grin. "A freak of 
nature I guess." 
</P>
<P>
About two years ago, Michel'le was working as a department-store cashier with 
zero career prospects. Reared in South-Central Los Angeles, she'd been 
interested in singing since she was a youngster but only worked at it casually. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I could make it big," she admitted. "I was just a cashier. I 
didn't want to be just another average person, but all I had was some dreams." 
</P>
<P>
She might still be mired in that mundane existence if, about two years ago, she 
hadn't met rap producer Dr. Dre, who produces N.W.A, Eazy-E and J.J. Fad. He 
got Michel'le a record deal and produced her album. "I didn't really know I 
could sing until I met him," said Michel'le, who also coyly admitted there's 
truth to the rumor that she's romantically linked with Dre. 
</P>
<P>
"He's responsible for all this. He convinced me I was a good singer. He urged 
me to write songs. He's pushed me. He's guided me. I don't know where I'd be 
without him -- probably still a cashier, I guess." DENNIS HUNT

RECORD RACK: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A

CALLOWAY 
</P>
<P>
"Calloway" Solar/Epic 
</P>
<P>
Brothers Reggie and Cino-vincent Calloway, formerly of Midnight Star, have 
produced a debut album that sounds as if they've been influenced by the 
catalogues of platinum-selling crossover acts like Lionel Richie and Atlantic 
Starr. "I Wanna Be Rich" -- currently a staple on pop radio -- is about as tame 
and mainstream as you can get. 
</P>
<P>
It's the type of record that's typically slammed by sneering critics and bought 
with wallet-waving abandon by pop audiences, and it's pretty obvious whose 
favor Calloway is courting. Those who like "I Wanna Be Rich" should be equally 
won over by "You Are My Everything," a ballad so unbelievably bland that it's 
hard to imagine its being performed by two guys who used to churn out funky 
fare like "Freak-a-zoid" and "Operator." CONNIE JOHNSON

PROFESSOR GRIFF &amp; THE LAST ASIATIC DISCIPLES 
</P>
<P>
"Pawns in the Game" Skyywalker Records 
</P>
<P>
The center of the Public Enemy anti-Semitism storm finally gets his chance to 
prove whether he has something to say -- or whether he just talks a lot. The 
verdict: Griff's mouth runneth over. 
</P>
<P>
Even at his most eloquent -- and often on his debut album he and his posse 
present their black-pride messages with forceful eloquence -- he does little 
more than parrot wisdoms and observations received from African-American 
leaders (Malcolm X on down) without regard for consistency or logic. 
</P>
<P>
Every call for cross-cultural unity is shot through with scatter-gun separatist 
rhetoric, every plea for peace countered with militaristic bravado and every 
line encouraging blacks to take responsibility for themselves undermined by 
blaming everyone but blacks for the world's problems. And "The Interview," is 
not the excerpt from his notorious Washington Times interview that he said 
would make clear that he was misunderstood, but just a jumble of speech and 
sounds that clears up nothing at all. 
</P>
<P>
To Griff's credit, he and the L.A.D. have fashioned some noteworthy settings 
for the rantings, though little approaching the innovative power of Public 
Enemy. Among the best is the two-part "Real African People," harking to the 
jazzy beat style of rap precursors the Last Poets and Gil Scott-Heron, whom -- 
to his further credit -- he acknowledges (among many others) in the 
album-closing litany "Blax Thanx." But then, he also acknowledges Moammar 
Kadafi, another master of inflammatory speech and self-serving rationales.

POP FACES: EX-BUNNYMAN IAN MCCULLOCH STEPS OUT ON HIS OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Echo &amp; the Bunnymen's 1987 album was supposed to be the one that would 
shoot them into the big time, the one that would transform them from cult stars 
into major rock stars, the one that would push them past rivals like U2 and the 
Cure. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the group's seventh album "Echo &amp; the Bunnymen" prompted singer 
Ian McCulloch to quit the band that he'd co-founded a decade earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we did the album twice was a warning sign," the deep-voiced 
Liverpudlian said during a recent visit to Los Angeles to remix a single from 
his solo debut LP "Candleland." "We spent 2 1/2 months on it the first time, 
and did it again similar length, and it was still the worst album." 
</P>
<P>
"Echo &amp; the Bunnymen" sold well enough, and the group undertook a 
high-profile U.S. tour with New Order. But McCulloch knew it had all gone 
stale, and he took a cue from his hometown soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
"The Liverpool football club have always had managers that know when to change 
the side a little bit and lose one of the key players and move on," he said, 
sitting in an office at Warner Bros. Records. "It always looks dignified the 
way it's done. It's not like a team that ever ends up strugglin'. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to be seen to need it that badly, to look desperate. The risk of 
doin' another album that didn't have somethin' special to me, I'd be in danger 
of never bein' able to pick meself up confidence-wise after that. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Leaving the Bunnymen wasn't the only transition the 30-year-old singer 
encountered in '88. 
</P>
<P>
As McCulloch prepared to play his final show with the Bunnymen in Osaka, Japan 
that April, he awaited news of his father, who'd been hospitalized in Liverpool 
with a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
"An hour before the last gig I found out he'd had a second heart attack. . . . 
I went on stage and kind of composed meself and did this gig that was very 
weird, very emotional. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
By the next morning, McCulloch and the band were on the last leg of the journey 
home, on the one-hour flight from London to Liverpool. 
</P>
<P>
"It was about a half hour before the plane landed he must have died. It was 
weird. I seemed to be the only one awake. Me mates had fallen asleep, and 
something seemed to come and brush past the plane halfway through the flight. 
At the time I just thought, 'Maybe that was me dad kissin' me goodby.' Maybe it 
was. I like to think it was. 
</P>
<P>
"It was funny. It was like a week of mournin' and feelin' weird and bad, and 
then one day I went to the toilet and I thought, 'Me dad's here, kind of 
watchin' me. . . .' I always had this thing when I was younger that someone was 
watchin' me. And now it's me dad, so it's kind of a nice, benign force."

NOTEBOOK: WELL-TRAVELED CHEF TRIES HER OWN PLACE

<TEXT>
<P>
Cindy Black has cooked in many different contexts over the years. 
</P>
<P>
She started off as an apprentice at the legendary Madeleine Kamman's Chez La 
Meaigure Madeleine in Boston, then worked at places as diverse as the respected 
Le Cabanon in Mages in far southwestern France), Apley's in the Boston Sheraton 
and Sheppard's at the Sheraton Harbor Island West in San Diego. Subsequently, 
she became executive chef of the San Diego-based Piret's group of delis and 
bistros, for whom, among other things, she supervised the opening of the 
short-lived Piret's in Beverly Hills in 1987. When San Diego's Paragon 
Restaurant Group took over Piret's, she became corporate chef for the whole 
organization, developing dishes and menu concepts for such Paragon properties 
as the Hungry Hunter, Rusty Pelican and Monterey Whaling Company restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Now, for the first time in her life, she has opened her own restaurant -- 
called simply Cindy Black's. Located in the Bird Rock area of La Jolla, the 
place serves Black's interpretations of country French dishes, with occasional 
Italian and American touches. Typical specialties include barbecued eggplant 
salad, chicken liver rillettes, spaghetti with pancetta and a fried egg, 
Provencal-style chicken stew, and roast leg of lamb with garlic mousse. Cindy 
Black's is open for dinner only, Tuesday through Sunday, with a special 
fixed-price dinner on that last day, featuring what Black calls "Sunday-dinner 
sort of food." 
</P>
<P>
THE BRITISH ARE COMING: Is Beverly Hills going British-club crazy? It was 
reported recently in this space that London-based entrepreneur Peter 
Stringfellow plans to open a local branch of his Stringfellow's 
"restaurant-clubs" in the Golden Ghetto's new Two Rodeo Building later this 
year. Now comes word that another Londoner, veteran club owner Alfred Barnett, 
is coming to town. Barnett, who has owned and operated such London hot spots as 
the Four Hundred, the Curzon House, the Palm Beach Club and the Ad Lib Club, 
plans to install an establishment called Madeleine's on the corner of Roxbury 
and Little Santa Monica. Like Stringfellow, Barnett promises that his dining 
room will be "among the best restaurants in L.A." Both will also feature piano 
music and "touch dancing." Madeleine's will have a cozy, intimate atmosphere, 
it is promised, giving Angelenos "a place to go where they can dress to the 
nines without attending a society fund-raiser or opening." There is nothing, of 
course, that Angelenos have been crying out for more plaintively in recent 
years than a place where they can go "dressed to the nines." That's the L.A. 
style, all right. . . . 
</P>
<P>
NOT SO BOUZY: Bouzy Rouge in Newport Beach has instituted an "under-indulgence" 
policy, offering half-size cocktails and after-dinner drinks (at half-price) 
for customers who might wish to sample something alcoholic without making a 
serious commitment of blood alcohol. Here's another idea along the same lines: 
In Germany, wine is sometimes packaged in 500-milliliter bottles, halfway 
between a half-bottle and a full one. Though our own Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms, which establishes federal policies for alcoholic beverages 
(including labeling laws and bottle-size limits), won't approve 500s for the 
American market, there's nothing to stop restaurateurs from offering 
500-milliliter carafes of decent house wine. Carafes are almost never used in 
U.S. restaurants for anything more than bulk wines, and I think that's a pity.

WHAT'S COOKING: Opera in Santa Monica has remodeled and reopened as Opera on 
Ocean, with two of the original investors in the place, Lou and Bernice Weider, 
as new owners. Chef Steve Neveaux continues in charge of the kitchen, with a 
menu that includes items from the original Opera menu as well as a number of 
new dishes. . . . Rannock Moor venison on a pickled walnut and game glaze, and 
a dessert of oatmeal, heather honey, and hazelnuts soaked in malt whiskey are 
among the contemporary Scottish specialties to be prepared by Billy Campbell, 
executive chef of the legendary St. Andrews Old Course Hotel in Scotland, 
Monday through Saturday at the Newport Beach Four Seasons. . . . Kurt Niklaus 
reports that he has entered negotiations to build a third Bistro Garden with 
the developers of the forthcoming Water Garden office in Santa Monica. That 
development will include 1.26-million square feet of floor space, a 1.4-acre 
lake, a health club and a day-care center. . . . And Tony Roma's in Beverly 
Hills has closed, the victim of (as is so often the case in that community 
these days) escalating rents.

In "Lean Times for Foreign-Language Films" (Feb. 25), both Calendar writer 
Sheila Benson and Gary Meyer, owner of Landmark Theaters, complain that college 
students do not appreciate foreign cinema and are frightened off by subtitles. 
</P>
<P>
I am a 20-year-old student and have seen more than half the films that Benson 
warmly recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps if Mr. Meyer did not charge $6.50 or $7 a ticket in his theaters, he 
would see a larger college crowd. Offer a substantial student discount, Mr. 
Meyer. I guarantee more students will have the chance to cultivate a taste for 
films from "over there."

So, the Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E. brothers are trying to get it across to other

Interesting! I guess that's why they were photographed wearing gang rags, with 
one member pointing what appears to be a weapon toward the camera lens.

And the word Boo-Yaa represents the sound of a sawed-off shotgun?

Since Filmex's demise in 1985, (foreign film) pickings have been mighty slim. 
</P>
<P>
My colleagues and I intend to correct this ridiculous state of affairs with the 
establishment of the American Cinematheque. Until mid-1993, when we're 
scheduled to open the doors of our permanent home, it appears that our weekend 
events and the UCLA Archive programs will make up the mainstream of 
foreign-language film programming. 
</P>
<P>
Later this year we will be presenting 16 films by the great Japanese masters as 
part of the Los Angeles Festival. 
</P>

Meanwhile, I thank Benson for raising this problem. It is certainly an outrage 
that our nation's second city is so culturally deprived due to lackadaisical 
distributors.

As the owners of our area's only cinema offering foreign fare for the past 11 
years, the last few years have been discouraging. 
</P>
<P>
One problem arising from the disappearance of small distributors of alternative 
films is the sorry fact of major distributors picking up small films and 
placing them in Screen 10 of a multi-screen theater, overlooking the 
independent cinemas that, often, would be a far better showcase. 
</P>
<P>
Benson is right about the disinterest in subtitled films by today's high school 
and college students -- the same group that spearheaded interest earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Think back to the last great foreign-language film you saw -- maybe the popular 
"My Life as a Dog" -- and we'll guarantee that the last thing you'll remember 
was that it was subtitled.

"Undercapitalized and over-performing" would have been a more accurate

GREAT AMERICAN'S TROUBLES CAST A SHADOW OVER S.D.

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For many San Diegans, the recent headlines on the financial problems of Great 
American Bank had an unpleasantly familiar ring. 
</P>
<P>
In a city that has long suffered from a civic inferiority complex, a feeling of 
being a poor second cousin to the world-class clout of Los Angeles and the 
allure of San Francisco, the news that San Diego-based Great American -- the 
nation's eighth-largest thrift -- was seeking outside help in raising capital 
to meet federal standards seemed like a new chapter in an old story. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in recent years, San Diego has seen some of its most prominent local 
businesses -- among them, Pacific Southwest Airlines, Oak Industries, the 
Wickes Corp. and Signal Companies -- either leave town or be swallowed up by 
larger corporations amid the merger craze of the '80s. With San Diego's 
political and business leaders already battling vociferously to prevent San 
Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. from being added to that list, the possibility 
that Great American might be acquired by outside investors produced hard 
swallows from City Hall to corporate board rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Though Great American's future remains uncertain, its recent actions have been 
tantamount to posting a "for sale" sign on the San Diego institution. That 
possibility, only one of several that could become reality by mid-spring, has 
generated glum speculation about the possible loss of a century-old major 
corporate citizen ingrained in virtually every facet of San Diego life. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, similar questions are posed about the man atop the Great American 
empire: Gordon Luce, a 64-year-old native San Diegan who over the past 20 years 
built the bank from a four-branch local operation to a 214-office giant with 
assets of $16.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Few have so legitimate a claim today to the title of "Mr. San Diego" as Luce, 
whose name has long been identified with the highest echelons of the city's 
political, business and social circles. A tall, slender, gray-haired man with a 
self-effacing modesty and a ready smile, Luce has been a confidant of one 
President and a friend to another; a prolific fund-raiser for myriad causes 
ranging from politics and the arts to health care and education; a man who, as 
San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor puts it, "has been there every time -- every 
time -- his community needed him." 
</P>
<P>
While Luce says that "it is a little premature" to write an unhappy ending to 
the Great American story, the thrift's problems undeniably threaten to severely 
undercut the personal power and prestige that he developed over the past two 
decades as the bank's chief executive officer. By parlaying his shrewd 
instincts, political connections and his own bank's meteoric rise, Luce has 
helped set policy throughout the entire savings and loan industry, and today is 
widely recognized as one of its powerhouses. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were to name the five most influential people in the industry, Luce 
would be one," said Barry M. Rubens, chief executive at California Research 
Corp., a Santa Monica-based savings and loan and bank consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financial Woes 
</P>
<P>
Great American's current financial quagmire is a direct result of its 1986 
acquisition of Home Federal Savings of Tucson, a purchase that brought on a 
harvest of woe in the form of bad loans stemming from economic problems and 
severe overbuilding of Arizona real estate. Forced to write down the loans' 
value to reflect the precipitous drop in real estate prices, Great American 
last year suffered a $123.9-million loss. 
</P>
<P>
The losses have reduced Great American's capital level to the point that, as of 
Dec. 31, Great American's capital was deficient in all three of the tough new 
capital adequacy tests applied by regulators in the aftermath of last summer's 
$160-billion rescue bill for the nation's troubled savings and loan industry. 
Then last week, Great American's auditor, Deloitte &amp; Touche, decided it 
wanted to extend its audit of the S&amp;L's 1989 loan-loss provision, a review 
that will probably result in deeper losses. Federal regulators in the Office of 
Thrift Supervision are also reviewing Great American's loans. 
</P>
<P>
With Arizona's real estate and loan values continuing to drop, industry 
analysts openly question Great American's ability to survive. In announcing 
that it hired an outside investment banking firm to help it raise capital, 
Great American all but admitted that its ownership may soon change. Some 
observers predict a forced merger with another savings and loan or with a bank 
such as Wells Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
Within banking and business circles, some suggest that Great American's woes 
were unavoidable, that the sinkhole that the Arizona financial scene has become 
could not have been foreseen. Others argue that Luce's outside political 
activities may have caused him to, as one termed it, take his "hands off the 
ball" at a critical juncture. And still others pointed to what they say is 
Luce's hands-off management style and tendency to delegate authority. 
</P>
<P>
Luce vehemently denies both assertions, saying he has devoted virtually all of 
his time to the S&amp;L over the last five years. Major decisions at Great 
American are made, he said, only after input from executive committees. 
</P>
<P>
As Great American searches for a solution to its financial morass, various 
what-if scenarios -- most of them unpleasant to contemplate -- have been 
discussed among the city's political and civic leaders. In particular, one 
question that is drawing increasingly nervous speculation is what impact would 
be felt by San Diego if Great American were ultimately acquired by outside 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a takeover has spawned hand-wringing among some city leaders 
who fret that it could reinforce the city's branch-town image. In the past 
year, of the county's 15 largest publicly held businesses, eight have either 
left town, been taken over or face the threat of acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Concern on that score, however, is a minority viewpoint, as Great American's 
uncertain future has not aroused the same kind of passions spawned by the 
proposed merger of SDG&amp;E with Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
"The city's identity or pride isn't wrapped up as much with a bank -- even one 
as big or important as Great American -- as it is with a utility that has the 
city's name in its title," O'Connor said. "That doesn't mean there's not 
concern. It's just on a different level." 
</P>
<P>
For most San Diegans, concern over Great American's corporate fate probably 
begins and ends with questions over whether the bank's woes endanger its 
depositors' accounts, which it clearly does not, thanks to federal deposit 
insurance. "If Great American got bought and its name changed, I don't think it 
would mean a damn thing to the average person," former Mayor Roger Hedgecock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But if a change in Great American's corporate structure would not rank as a 
civic trauma, a takeover could create a significant void with far-reaching 
ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout its history, Great American has been one of San Diego's most 
generous corporate citizens that annually contributes slightly less than $1 
million to a wide range of social and civic programs. The bank's list of local 
beneficiaries -- complemented by, in many cases, Luce's personal contributions 
-- includes the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, the Urban League, the 
Greater San Diego Sports Assn. and numerous local cultural organizations, as 
typified by last year's $50,000 donation to the Soviet Arts Festival. In the 
late 1980s, Great American sponsored a much heralded education program aimed at 
increasing attendance among junior high students -- "Miss School, Miss Out" -- 
that was honored at a White House ceremony as one of the nation's best 
private-sector projects. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Brezzo, director of the San Diego Museum of Art, emphasized that, given 
San Diego's scarcity of corporate headquarters, Great American "would be very 
hard to match or replace" in terms of its continuing commitment to the arts. 
</P>
<P>
It is a measure of the depths of Great American's problems that some openly 
question, not only whether the thrift will be in a position to continue its 
charitable-giving, but also whether Luce himself will continue to head the 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost as American as apple pie, baseball and motherhood that you change 
managers, the guy at the top, when the team doesn't have a winning record," 
said Peter Davis, president of the Bank of Commerce of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
If such a change was made, it would be one of the few blemishes on Luce's 
family history since his ancestors arrived in San Diego County more than a 
century ago. Luce's grandfather, Moses Luce, was a pioneer lawyer, and his 
father, Edgar, was a state senator, Superior Court judge and co-founder of one 
of San Diego's oldest and most prestigious law firms, Luce Forward Hamilton 
&amp; Scripps. 
</P>
<P>
Luce was introduced to banking at San Diego's Home Federal Savings. 
</P>
<P>
During his 10-year tenure at Home Fed, Luce rose to become senior vice 
president of marketing. Luce soon became Home Fed's major political operative, 
arranging campaign contributions and working for local Republican candidates. 
Using his growing personal prestige and that of Home Fed, Luce developed a 
reputation as one of the city's most important and irresistible fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been chairman of half of the major fund-raising activities in town. He 
had a lot of chits because he has done a lot of things for people, businesswise 
and socially," said Norman Roberts, a longtime friend and fellow Republican 
activist. "If you get a call from Gordon and he asks you for money, it's 
difficult to say no because you know someday you're going to be calling him." 
</P>
<P>
That fund-raising ability figured significantly in Luce getting the title of 
San Diego County treasurer of Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign. And 
it was during one fund-raiser for Goldwater in La Jolla that Luce was to meet 
the man with whom he was to become so closely identified: Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
After the Goldwater debacle, Luce was one of a handful of key Southern 
California businessmen who took an interest in Reagan's political career and 
who encouraged him to run for California governor. Luce followed Reagan to 
Sacramento in 1966, becoming Secretary for Business and Transportation, quickly 
establishing himself, along with Casper Weinberger, as one of Reagan's most 
trusted lieutenants. 
</P>
<P>
"I attended every Cabinet meeting in my six years in Sacramento and had the 
opportunity to watch all the players, and it was clear to everybody that Luce 
and Casper Weinberger" had Reagan's ear most often, said Edwin Gray, then a 
Reagan press secretary who would later become a Great American executive and 
still later Federal Home Loan Bank Board chairman. 
</P>
<P>
But after three years in Sacramento, Luce yearned to return to San Diego and to 
business. Eleven years later, when Reagan became President, that preference for 
the private sector caused Luce to gently deflect inquiries about his interest 
in either a Cabinet-level post or ambassadorship. 
</P>
<P>
"They called me the Reluctant One," Luce recalled, chuckling. "I would always 
say, 'Maybe next year.' Then when next year came, I'd say, 'No, I'm still too 
busy.' " 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Sacramento in 1969, Luce became chief executive of San Diego 
Federal, which in the 1980s would be renamed Great American Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Luce wasted little time putting his imprint on San Diego Federal, embarking on 
statewide expansion to capitalize on California's rapid population growth. The 
success of the plan, Luce realized, would depend largely on creating a 
standardized image for the S&amp;L's branches, akin to that of McDonald's and 
Holiday Inns. In keeping with that strategy, Great American adopted a 
coordinated style for all of the branch architecture, uniforms and employee 
training, Luce said. 
</P>
<P>
Luce also put Great American at the vanguard of the automated teller machine 
revolution, claiming to be the first California financial institution to 
install a statewide ATM network. 
</P>
<P>
Great American also earned high marks for being the first San Diego County 
S&amp;L to establish branches in Southeast San Diego and San Ysidro, two 
low-income areas of San Diego that at the time suffered from redlining, the 
practice of refusing loans in geographically prescribed areas. 
</P>
<P>
But Luce's rapid growth strategy -- the S&amp;L's assets grew from $4.4 billion 
in 1982 to $16.1 billion as of Dec. 31 -- ultimately landed Great American in 
trouble. Much of that growth was accomplished by acquiring 16 outside thrifts, 
and one of the acquisitions, Home Federal of Tucson, has turned out to be a 
financial black hole that could cost Great American its independence. 
</P>
<P>
Great American is by no means alone in its Arizona misery. There are only three 
S&amp;Ls left in Arizona that have not been taken over by regulators, said 
William Ferguson, a S&amp;L consultant based in Irving, Tex. Other large 
financial institutions, including First Interstate Bank, have stumbled there as 
well. U.S. Postmaster Gen. Anthony M. Frank, who from 1971 to 1988 was chief 
executive of First Nationwide Savings in San Francisco, and who preceded Luce 
as president of the state S&amp;L league, said even banks and thrifts using the 
most conservative lending practices have stumbled badly in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his appraisal of Luce being "likable, a professional manager and 
certainly the most astute politically on the Republican side that the industry 
has," Frank said Luce ultimately has to accept responsibility for the Arizona 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say Luce took his hands off the ball," Frank said. "The S&amp;L 
business is, all things being said, a detail business. When you start to be too 
much of an elder statesman, then you start turning details over to other people 
and it justs seems that that doesn't work out very well."

In the years since, the disposable diaper has been improved: There are 
elasticized leg bands, gels, super absorbency, and anatomically efficient "his" 
and "hers" designs. 
</P>
<P>
It has become a $3.5-billion-a-year industry, and 85% of American mothers use 
them. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the disposable diaper has become a prime target of angry 
environmentalists who consider it the very symbol of the ills of a throwaway 
society. The problem is what to do with it once it has done its job. Throwaway 
diapers are piling up in the waste stream. 
</P>
<P>
The way a mother covers her baby's bottom has become a subject of hot debate in 
statehouses and city halls. The issue has generated piles of reports and 
pamphlets. Who would have thought the manufacturers of disposable diapers would 
have to go to such lengths to defend such a wonder product?

Bills that would ban, restrict or tax sales of disposable diapers are before 
the legislatures of a dozen states. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the controversy has breathed new life into the diaper service 
business, and it could prove a boon to corn farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Studies show that although disposable diapers are only about 2% of the nation's 
trash, they last 500 years in a landfill. One proposed solution is a 
more-expensive biodegradable diaper, and that's where the corn farmers come in. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne Wirka, a solid-waste-reduction expert with the Environmental Action 
Foundation, said the disposable diaper is the largest single one-use product 
for which there is a readily available alternative -- cloth diapers. 
</P>
<P>
But the convenience factor is extraordinary. Many day-care centers, for 
example, will not accept youngsters in cloth diapers. 
</P>
<P>
And, if everyone switched to cloth tomorrow, there would be chaos. There are 
not enough cloth diapers or cloth diaper services in the country to accommodate 
them. In environmentally hip Washington, D.C., 400 names are on the waiting 
list for the one diaper service in town. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Diaper Services, after years of decline, reported a 38% 
increase in business last year and a 13% rise the year before. The disposable 
diaper makers, however, say they see no blip yet on their sales screen. 
</P>
<P>
The debate has produced strange bedfellows. The six most active environmental 
groups and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Kimberly-Clark Corp., the disposable 
diaper manufacturers who control more than 75% of the market, agree that 
biodegradable diapers are not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, environmentalists called for a boycott of degradable diapers, 
saying their use merely assuages the consumer's conscience. Biodegradable 
diapers don't decompose in landfills because there is not enough moisture or 
oxygen in a dump, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Taking an opposing view is the National Assn. of Corn Growers, based in St. 
Louis. Cornstarch is used in the degradables and this could open up a market of 
150 million to 300 million bushels a year for the nation's corn farmers, 
spokesman Tim Draeger said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the only state to enact legislation has been Nebraska, which passed a 
law last session requiring the use of biodegradables by 1993. Nebraska, it 
might be noted, is the nation's third-largest corn-producing state, just behind 
Iowa and Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Draeger argues that if the biodegradable diaper technology were improved, it 
would mean America would be less dependent on foreign oil. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in the infancy of this technology," he said. "We are at the Model T 
level. We have to learn to walk before we can run." 
</P>
<P>
Wirka said that is plain silly because the amount of "foreign oil" in diapers 
is negligible and the so-called degradables also contain some oil. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble, with a $1.65-billion slice of the 
disposable pie -- compared to Kimberly-Clark's $840 million -- has taken a much 
higher profile in its fight to keep baby's bottom in Pampers and Luvs. 
</P>
<P>
Although close-mouthed about how much it is spending on the diaper wars, P 
&amp; G is sponsoring two well-publicized projects, one in Seattle 
demonstrating that plastic diapers can be recycled and another in St. Cloud, 
Minn., to show that diapers can be composted. The Seattle project is reputed to 
be a $500,000 venture. 
</P>
<P>
"If you could throw that kind of money at every segment of the trash problem in 
America, we wouldn't have a trash problem," said Jeffrey Tryens of the Council 
for Policy Alternatives, a Washington-based environmental group. "It's just 
good public relations for Procter &amp; Gamble." 
</P>
<P>
Wirka, however, thinks the St. Cloud project may have some merit, although, she 
said: "That recycling project is just bogus. 
</P>
<P>
"Procter &amp; Gamble is in a difficult position. They are always the target 
here and they are applying their corporate good guy image on something that is 
economically very dubious. I'm more willing to say that the composting project 
is a more fruitful use of their resources." 
</P>
<P>
P&amp;G, it should be noted, has been a leader in recycling plastic bottles for 
its products, selling refills for the same plastic bottle and marketing 
concentrates in smaller bottles where the consumer just needs to add water. Its 
soaps are also biodegradable. 
</P>
<P>
Since the diaper wars started making the nightly news shows, politicians have 
gotten bolder. Tryens said he called a meeting about a year ago, inviting 
legislators, lobbyists, environmentalists and others concerned about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, nobody even considered discussing a statewide ban," he said. 
"The feeling was that no respectable politician would even propose such 
legislation and that it just wouldn't fly." 
</P>
<P>
But one year later, the state of Vermont is proposing just such legislation as 
part of a much larger environmental bill. If passed, no disposable diapers 
would be sold in Vermont after 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Alexander of New Haven, Conn., is one who's profiting by it all. She 
started her own cloth diaper service in January and said clients are flocking 
to her door. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted to go into my own business and this just sort of fell into 
my lap," she said. "What's more is that all of my clients treat me like I'm 
some kind of a hero." 
</P>
<P>
One of her clients with a newborn baby said her 4-year-old was watching her 
change the baby with a disposable diaper and had a quizzical look on her face. 
</P>
<P>
"What is it?" asked the mother. 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't they invent a diaper you could just wash and use over and over?" 
asked the child. 
</P>

U.S. IS EXPECTED TO ADMIT IDAHO INDIAN MASSACRE; 
</P>
<P>
LANDMARK: THE CHIEF HISTORIAN FOR THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE HAS CONCLUDED THAT 
THE 1863 "BATTLE OF BEAR RIVER" WAS REALLY A MASSACRE -- THE WORST ON RECORD. 
THE U.S. CAVALRY KILLED HUNDREDS OF SHOSHONE, INCLUDING INFANTS, WOMEN AND 
CHILDREN.

BEAR RIVER, Ida. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than a century after the blood of hundreds of Northwestern Shoshone 
stained the snowy banks of the Bear River, the federal government may be ready 
to admit that U.S. soldiers here carried out a massacre unrivaled in the annals 
of the West. 
</P>
<P>
Since Jan. 29, 1863, this spot 110 miles north of Salt Lake City has been known 
for the "Battle of Bear River," described by Col. Patrick Connor as a glorious 
struggle won by classic military tactics and superior firepower. 
</P>
<P>
Persistent Shoshone claims to the contrary were ignored. Survivors recounted 
the "battle" as a day of savagery in which soldiers smashed infants' skulls, 
raped dying women and dispatched the wounded with bullets, clubs and axes. 
</P>
<P>
Connor lost 14 of his 200 men. An estimated 270 to 400 Shoshones died, 
two-thirds of them women and children. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin C. Bearss, chief historian for the National Park Service, agreed after 
extensive research that history should be rewritten to reflect the Shoshone 
side. 
</P>
<P>
"The attack was sharp, sudden and vigorous. There were heavy casualties," he 
said. "A good case can be made that there were more Indian casualties in this 
attack than any other made by U.S. forces west of the Mississippi." 
</P>
<P>
Bear River was "much more grim" than better-known Indian massacres at Sand 
Creek in Colorado Territory, where troopers killed 133 Cheyenne on Nov. 28, 
1864, and at Wounded Knee, S. D., where soldiers slaughtered 153 Sioux on Dec. 
28, 1890, Bearss said. He said that news of the attack was pushed out of most 
newspapers by accounts of fierce Civil War battles at Fredericksburg, Va., and 
Stone's River, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of Indian losses at Bear River varied; no official count was made. 
Tradition has it that Connor, from horseback, counted between 220 and 270 dead. 
Settlers who arrived later found many more bodies in ravines or under deep snow 
and put the number as high as 500. The tribe maintains that 400 of their number 
were killed there and no more than 60 escaped or survived. 
</P>
<P>
On April 3, Bearss will recommend that the ground, just outside Preston, Ida., 
be designated a National Historic Landmark as the site of the "Bear River 
Massacre." If it passes muster with the agency's advisory panel, the proposal 
will be sent to Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., probably in May. 
</P>
<P>
As for Connor's version, Bearss says history is replete with lies and omissions 
made to paint heroic pictures. Connor and his California Volunteers had signed 
up to fight Johnny Reb and resented being assigned to protect Mormon settlers 
here and keep an eye on the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Attacking an Indian village was a poor substitute for battlefield glory, but it 
was all the ambitious Connor could do to impress his superiors. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was a colonel," Bearss said, "it would be to my career's benefit if I 
portrayed (Bear River) as a pitched battle. As a career soldier you're looking 
for career success, and body counts have always been important." 
</P>
<P>
In late January, 1863, hundreds of Indians had set up tepees at Bia Ogoi, or 
Bear River, for the Warm Dance, an annual winter ritual to drive away the cold. 
</P>
<P>
The night of Jan. 27, one tribal elder awoke from a nightmarish vision: The 
white man's pony soldiers were slaughtering his people. Tin Dup took this as as 
a warning from the Great Spirit and told anyone who would listen to flee the 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
"Do it now! Tonight!" he begged them. 
</P>
<P>
Few left with Tin Dup. Most dismissed the gloomy prediction and remained with 
the campfires for sleepy conversation. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of sources, including Army reports, books and carefully preserved 
tribal oral histories, prove that Tin Dup was a visionary. 
</P>
<P>
Just before dawn on Jan. 29, Connor's cavalry formed up on the bluffs that rose 
200 feet above Chief Sagwitch Timbimboo's still-sleeping encampment. After a 
frostbitten, three-day ride from Utah's Ft. Douglas, 110 miles to the south, 
the unit of 275 was on a mission to "chastise" and "exterminate" Indians 
believed responsible for recent clashes with white settlers. 
</P>
<P>
Three Shoshone had stolen some horses and cattle a few weeks before, and Connor 
also blamed the tribe for killing a miner and two settlers. The Shoshone 
insisted that the killings were the work of other Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Across the Bear River, Sagwitch rose early to watch his camp awaken. Suddenly, 
his eyes were drawn to the eastern hills. A strange dust was moving down the 
slopes, out of which thundered Connor's soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Even as his startled warriors gathered their bows, tomahawks and a few muskets, 
Sagwitch ordered them not to shoot, believing that the soldiers would seek to 
parley. Had Connor asked for the livestock thieves, they would have been 
surrendered, according to tribal accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Connor's expectation of hostility could only have been strengthened by his 
scout, Orrin Porter Rockwell, a bodyguard of Mormon pioneer Brigham Young. 
Rockwell, who would watch the bloodshed from the safety of the bluffs, had told 
Connor that perhaps 600 Shoshone warriors were ready to do battle, according to 
a 1985 history. 
</P>
<P>
Connor sent his cavalry across the river, determined to block any retreat. As 
the infantry closed in, the Indians ran for the ice-clogged river and the banks 
soon were bloody with wounded and dead. Women, many with infants on their 
backs, joined the desperate plunge. Most drowned; others were shot as they 
swam. A few escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Sagwitch, wounded in one hand, tumbled into the river and floated under some 
brush. After nightfall, he and a few warriors found ponies and fled north. 
</P>
<P>
Back in camp, soldiers took babies by the heels and dashed them to death. 
Wounded women were raped even as they died. 
</P>
<P>
Another chief, Bear Hunter, endured a savage beating. His wife, 
Be-ah-wa-a-chee, who watched from hiding in nearby willows, recalled that Bear 
Hunter did not cry out, even when soldiers rammed a heated bayonet through his 
head, ear to ear. 
</P>
<P>
Sagwitch's 12-year-old grandson, Yeager Timbimboo, played dead. A soldier who 
discovered him alive raised his musket to the boy's head three times but 
couldn't fire. 
</P>
<P>
The trooper walked away, leaving the youth to grow up telling a story far 
different than the account of a pitched battle given by soon-to-be Brig. Gen. 
Patrick Connor. 
</P>
<P>
One who heard his story was his granddaughter, Mae Timbimboo Parry. For Parry, 
who has spent much of her 70 years recording tribal oral history, landmark 
designation of the Bear River site is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been telling this story for so long, I felt I was like the Lone Ranger," 
she said. "I'll say it was a massacre to my dying day." 
</P>
<P>
So will Allie Hansen, president of the Bear River-Battle Creek Monument Assn., 
although that wasn't always the case. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, her group was behind passage of a resolution by Utah and Idaho 
legislators that would have erected a Battle of Bear River monument. Parry 
threatened to sue, insisting that the word "battle" had no place there. 
</P>
<P>
To resolve the dispute, Sen. James McClure (R-Ida.) asked the Park Service to 
study the attack as part of a landmark application. The assignment went to 
Bearss, a Civil War expert. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Hansen's own research persuaded her that the Indians were right. A 
descendant of southern Idaho homesteaders, she said she had been "naively kept 
in the dark." 
</P>
<P>
She also learned to appreciate the tribe's intense feelings about the massacre. 
"Even after all this time, to them it is like something that just happened," 
Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1860s, the Northwestern Shoshone thrived by following game and the 
seasons over eastern Nevada, northern Utah, southern Idaho and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the tribe counts only 350 members. 
</P>
<P>
"We have never recovered from the massacre," Parry said. "We've never quite 
recovered."

THREATS BATTER MOTHER WHO JOINED DRUG WAR

<P>
Wendy Stanek stiffened instantly. 
</P>
<P>
She had been slouched on the witness stand, acting more like a defiant 
teen-ager than the undercover drug informer that she is. Then the lawyer asked 
about threats. 
</P>
<P>
"Threats? Yeah, someone has been calling me lately," said Stanek, a mother of 
seven. "I'm thinking of moving the kids, yes." 
</P>
<P>
Pivoting in her chair, she glared at half a dozen defendants accused of dealing 
drugs, each of whom she had helped put in the Iron County courtroom that day. 
"Whoever's calling me, I hope you're enjoying it," she said to them. 
</P>
<P>
Stanek expected threats when she contacted the police last summer and 
volunteered to become an informer in Crystal Falls, a remote timbering town of 
1,965 people near the Wisconsin border in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Now a caller is promising to do perverted, criminal things to her children. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it's bad, the 35-year-old unemployed, twice-divorced barmaid said late one 
night last month, drinking beers and smoking cigarettes at a downtown tavern. A 
friend was watching the kids at her home. 
</P>
<P>
The bar owner ordered a beer and sat down beside Stanek. "I give her a lot of 
credit," he said, raising his glass in salute. 
</P>
<P>
The police are doing what they can about the threats, trying to identify the 
caller and increasing patrols past her two-story house in the middle of town, 
but they say they have no way to totally protect Stanek from retribution. 
</P>
<P>
Officers warned Stanek it might be like this. "All it takes is one idiot. All 
it takes is one flake," said Lt. Bill Johnson, the Michigan State Police 
detective who heads UPSET, the Upper Peninsula Substance Enforcement Team, a 
federally funded drug task force. 
</P>
<P>
"Wendy is one who just wouldn't listen," Johnson said. "She was motivated very 
strongly because of the death of her son." 
</P>
<P>
Stanek's life turned on its edge in June, 1987, when her eldest child, 
15-year-old Ryan, died in a car crash after hitching a ride home with friends 
who had been at a party. 
</P>
<P>
His ashes are in a marble box in a glass cabinet in the corner of the dining 
room. Ryan's soiled baseball cap sits on top of the box, next to Stanek's many 
citations and a photograph of a Crystal Falls girl who killed herself, one of 
three local teen suicides last year -- a reminder to Stanek of the perils faced 
by the town's children, and her own. 
</P>
<P>
Stanek describes the cabinet as "my little tomb." 
</P>
<P>
After an emergency-room nurse mistakenly gave Stanek the clothes of another boy 
hurt in the accident, and she found a hash pipe tucked in one of the shoes, 
Stanek took her rage and grief to Johnson and UPSET. She penetrated the drug 
world in Crystal Falls and surrounding small towns, buying more cocaine and 
marijuana than the task force could pay for. 
</P>
<P>
She said she simply picked up the phone and called almost 50 people and asked 
if they would sell her marijuana or cocaine. All but one said yes. 
</P>
<P>
Stanek said it was amazingly easy. It gave her a giddy sense of justice. 
"Anybody could do it. You could do it," she told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
She broke her cover and quit her bar job last Christmas when UPSET went public 
with 23 arrests in Crystal Falls, Iron River and neighboring towns. 
</P>
<P>
The threats started immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people are scums anyway," Stanek told a reporter after the first calls. 
"They said they would hire a hit man from Chicago. Big deal." 
</P>
<P>
Until a Feb. 14 message, the threats were aimed only at Stanek. But on 
Valentine's Day, she received an envelope with a magazine clipping of a mother 
caressing a naked baby. There was also a handwritten note. 
</P>
<P>
"Less than 15 minutes after this picture was taken, the woman was stripped 
completely nude and both she, and the child, were thrown into a large vat of 
boiling water! Bye Bye Wendy!" 
</P>
<P>
The calls threatening to harm Stanek's children, always by the same male voice, 
were coming at the rate of one a day until recently, when they tapered off. But 
Stanek is still considering moving her family out of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Stanek's son, Jamey, 15, wants to stay in Crystal Falls. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to move," he said, wearing a plaid hunting shirt and fidgeting at 
the kitchen table, eager to go snowmobiling. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't go," Jamey said. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll go," said Stanek, who went on welfare after quitting her job and who 
spends most of her days in court testifying against the men and women she says 
sold her drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Around their disagreement, chaos momentarily held forth. Thirteen-year-old 
Rikki, her blond hair moussed in the latest fashion, had just baked a cake but 
was insisting that her mother frost it. Two-year-old Lacy, wearing nothing but 
one of her brothers' T-shirts, was racing bare-bottomed across the linoleum 
behind a hyperactive terrier mutt named Pee Wee. 
</P>
<P>
After spending an eight-hour day at the courthouse, Stanek stood in the 
kitchen, juggling the demands of supper -- a skillet of ground beef and 
Hamburger Helper -- along with the cake, the dog, her kids, a reporter and a 
photographer and telephone calls from a news producer for a television network. 
</P>
<P>
This is normal, said Scott Thrasher, Stanek's boyfriend, as he watched from a 
perch at the kitchen table. 
</P>
<P>
The threats have not changed Stanek's life, said Thrasher, who owns a gas 
station in nearby Sagola. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of it has been good," Thrasher said. "When we go out to dinner, somebody 
stops by to congratulate Wendy." 
</P>
<P>
But the threats against her children have the otherwise unshakable Stanek 
worried. She turned from the stove, gripping the skillet of hamburger in one 
hand and the spatula in the other. 
</P>
<P>
"If they touch my kids, I'll kill them."

Police used tear gas and steel-tipped truncheons Friday to break up students 
protesting an Islamic conference in the northern town of Bogra, and at least 30 
people were injured, news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters were demonstrating against controversial Muslim leader Maulana 
Belwar Hossain Saidi, who was due to speak at the conference at Bogra, 100 
miles north of Dhaka, according to the independent United News of Bangladesh. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters complain that Saidi opposed the 1971 war in which Bangladesh 
gained independence from Pakistan. Saidi, a central leader of Muslim 
fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami, denied the charge.

LEFTIST GUERRILLA SABOTAGE PUTS OUT LIGHTS, CRIPPLES INDUSTRY IN PERU

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost every night, in a deserted field or on a mountainside, a charge of 
dynamite goes off and Peruvians' lights go out. 
</P>
<P>
The sabotage of high-tension pylons by leftist guerrillas who call themselves, 
ironically, the Shining Path is plunging Peruvians into darkness and cutting 
dangerously into the nation's industrial output. 
</P>
<P>
Power rationing has become a daily headache for millions of people in Lima and 
other major cities that depend on hydroelectric power that is brought over the 
Andes. 
</P>
<P>
Lima has a new sound -- the almost constant hum of thousands of portable 
gasoline generators. 
</P>
<P>
Its streets are in almost constant gridlock because traffic lights are out. 
Restaurants and house wives complain of food spoiling because refrigerators 
aren't working. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords are slashing rents for the upper floors of high-rise apartment 
buildings to entice renters worried about climbing the stairs when elevators 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
Since July 28, 1980, when the first high-tension pylon was blown up in the 
mountains near Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima -- as President Fernando 
Belaunde Terry was giving his state-of-the-union address -- 1,205 towers have 
fallen, according to the state power company Electroperu. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 335 were felled last year alone and more than 100 have been toppled 
since municipal elections in November, when the rebels blew up 80 in one week 
in an effort -- largely unsuccessful, as it turned out -- to disrupt the 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
The rainy season that lasts from January to May in the Highlands is making it 
difficult for repair crews to reach toppled towers, and Electroperu says it 
does not know how long power rationing, which began in mid-November, will 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole system is a shambles," said Jose Dibos of the National Industrial 
Society. "We are running into an almost continuous situation where power 
outages have to be accepted as a way of life." 
</P>
<P>
The Shining Path took up arms in 1980 to bring down Peru's elected government 
and install a peasant-worker state patterned on the ideas of Mao Tse-tung of 
China. 
</P>
<P>
The government said more than 17,500 people have died in the violence and 
economic costs have surpassed $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Damage to the electrical system has cost the country more than $600 million, 
including repairs and lost electrical output, according to Electroperu. The 
company said it costs about $20,000 to replace a tower. 
</P>
<P>
The Industrial Society's Dibos said the electric company has been able to 
maintain a "precarious balance" only because industries are operating at 50% of 
capacity due to the country's economic problems, which included 2,775% 
inflation last year and a 12% drop in the gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the damaged power grid is a "time bomb" that is costing industry 
millions of dollars in lost production and ruined materials and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
One of the hardest hit areas is the glass industry, whose ovens need a 
continuous supply of power to allow for the slow heating and cooling required 
to make glass. 
</P>
<P>
The Industrial Society said glass production has dropped by half. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost impossible for an industrial user to predict when he is going to 
get power and for how long," Dibos said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the power supplied to Lima, where a third of Peru's 22 million people 
live, comes from Electroperu's hydroelectric dam on the Mantaro River in a 
mountain valley 165 miles east of Lima. 
</P>
<P>
Three interconnected lines carry power over the Andes to the coast, each 
passing through guerrilla country. One of the three has been down since 1987, 
when Electroperu withdrew its repair crews after guerrillas burned 10 company 
trucks and threatened to kill workers if they returned. 
</P>
<P>
An Electroperu spokesman, Jose Acevedo, said repair crews on the other two 
lines know they are being watched. 
</P>
<P>
"They watch them from a distance, and as soon as they finish raising a tower, 
the terrorists come in and blow up another one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Acevedo said one tower was felled six times before the army strung barbed wire 
and planted land mines around it.

IRELAND'S PRO-CHOICE CENSORSHIP ISSUE DEBATED; 
</P>
<P>
ABORTION: THE COUNTRY'S SUPREME COURT HAS RULED THAT EVEN PUBLISHING 
INFORMATION ON HOW TO GET SUCH SERVICES IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY VIOLATES THE 
CONSTITUTION.

<TEXT>
<P>
Irish editions of Cosmopolitan, the glossy women's magazine, appear with blank 
spaces that should contain classified ads for British abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
More than six years after a referendum vote to enshrine a ban on abortion in 
the constitution of Ireland, which is 93% Roman Catholic, it has become a 
censorship issue. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the national student union had to stop circulating its official 
handbook because it contained information on abortion services. 
</P>
<P>
Student leaders talk of defying a Dec. 19 court injunction and smuggling copies 
in from Northern Ireland. Abortion is banned in the British province too, but 
not information on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Riddick, a feminist who ran a pregnancy counseling service, still gets 
anxious calls at home, most of them from men with pregnant girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
"The debate has become both more one-sided and more trivial," said Riddick, a 
35-year-old arts administrator. 
</P>
<P>
"It has shifted from deep moral issues about whether women have a right to 
choose. . . . A woman's abortion experience is being reduced into a simple 
question of 'Where the hell do I get a phone number?' " 
</P>
<P>
Marie Vernon, a campaigner against abortion, countered: "You don't have an 
absolute right to information. A primary right is the right to life, and all 
other rights are secondary." 
</P>
<P>
Abortion always has been illegal in Ireland. The ban was reinforced by the 1983 
decision to write it into the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1988, and again last December, the Supreme Court ruled that giving 
information on how to get an abortion in a foreign country violates the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
That does not make it a criminal offense, but it enables anti-abortionists to 
win injunctions. Violators of the injunctions can be jailed for contempt of 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Now the battle has moved to European courts, which must rule whether the ban 
violates the rights of the 3.5 million people in Ireland to get the same 
information as other West Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish rulings climaxed lengthy civil actions brought by the Society for the 
Protection of the Unborn Child, the main anti-abortion lobby outside the Roman 
Catholic Church, against two pregnancy counseling services and the student 
union. 
</P>
<P>
Riddick closed her counseling service, but she still provides information from 
home, risking contempt proceedings. The Dublin Well Woman Center, a general 
health clinic that ran the other counseling service, no longer gives 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland is the only European country with a total ban on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Divorce and homosexuality also are illegal, and the church runs most schools 
and hospitals. Contraception was legalized only a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
In Ireland, the abortion issue seems at once starker and more complicated than 
the customary arguments about women's rights and respect for human life. 
</P>
<P>
Even liberals don't expect to see abortion legalized within a generation, and 
they acknowledge that the opposition is deep-rooted and widespread. 
</P>
<P>
They say the controversy about information has increased women's fear and 
guilt, prevented proper counseling and made late abortions more likely. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1983, we packed halls with people fighting publicly for legal abortion; 
now, many are afraid to call for a right to information,' said Pauline Ryder, 
head of the Well Woman Clinic, which is privately financed. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, at least 4,000 Irish women go to Britain for abortions. Most pay 
about $340 at private clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The annual figure, based on abortions performed in Britain on women who gave 
addresses in Ireland, has changed little in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Moving the dispute into the realm of free speech has increased support for the 
pro-choice lobby. 
</P>
<P>
An attempt last year by the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child to 
jail four student leaders over the handbook provoked large demonstrations 
outside the court. 
</P>
<P>
In January, students voted 3 to 1 to support the Union of Students in Ireland, 
which has 60,000 members, in its refusal to stop giving information on abortion 
clinics in the handbook or by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say the population supports abortion, but there is sympathy for our 
fight against censorship," said Karen Quinlivan, a 23-year-old law graduate who 
is the women's rights officer at the student headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"In the ballots, the students voted contrary to what we've been taught all our 
lives," she said. "There's a feeling that SPUC is carrying things too far. . . 
. These people are extreme and dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Vernon, spokeswoman for the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, is 
a cheerful homemaker in her mid-40s with five children. 
</P>
<P>
Her youngest child, 8-month-old Sean, is adopted. His natural mother, an 
unmarried teen-ager, lived with the Vernon family during her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just the sort of baby who might have been terminated, as they like to 
call it," Vernon said, then laughed and added, "But I feel a bit guilty using 
him as a sales point." 
</P>
<P>
On the walls of the society's one-room headquarters in a well-to-do Dublin 
suburb are a disturbing picture of a late-term abortion and one of Pope John 
Paul II cuddling a baby. 
</P>
<P>
The society, founded in 1980, says it is non-sectarian and has no direct 
support from the church. 
</P>
<P>
Membership peaked at about 4,000 during the referendum debate, but now is about 
1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Cosmopolitan was censored after a citizen complained to the Censorship and 
Publications Board, a government agency. The board, which can ban any 
publication it feels "advocates the procurement of abortion," told Cosmopolitan 
last year to drop the ads. 
</P>
<P>
"We agonized over it," said Simon Kippon, the American magazine's publisher in 
Britain. "In the end, we decided . . . we'd make the point with the blank 
space." 
</P>
<P>
The magazine, owned by the Hearst Corp., sells 13,000 copies a month in 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Another Hearst women's magazine, Company, pulled an eight-page supplement on 
abortion from the March issue of its Irish edition because it included clinic 
addresses. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cosmopolitan initiative was serious and Company's self-censorship was even 
more so," Riddick said. "Once you put those kind of precedents in place, they 
can be applied across the board."

<TEXT>
<P>
The future of private television in the Eastern Bloc is here on the 11th floor 
of a student dormitory, in a windowless janitor's room where three wall 
calendars depict Polish women in various stages of undress. 
</P>
<P>
As far as hardware is concerned, there is not much else in the broadcast center 
of Echo TV-Channel 28 to catch the eye. The electronics are unimpressive: a 
living-room videocassette recorder, a Commodore computer keyboard on loan from 
a Wroclaw teen-ager, a homemade transmitter with the main broadcast cable 
snaking up to a rooftop antenna through a wall vent. 
</P>
<P>
The total cash investment in the first private television station in Eastern 
Europe comes to a whopping $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
"People who know television have come here and told us that only maniacs could 
use this kind of equipment," said Henryk Pacha, one of the eight founders of 
Echo TV, which went on the air in mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
But in the duller-than-dull world of Communist-bred television, where 
apparatchiks have stupefied the masses for decades with documentaries about 
tractors in pursuit of five-year plans, the future may well belong to maniacs 
willing to broadcast from dormitory closets. 
</P>
<P>
For on a recent weekday evening, when Polish state television Channel 1 was 
airing a talking-head panel program about business problems, Echo TV was 
building its growing audience -- estimated at 700,000 in this city in 
southwestern Poland -- with 1 1/2 hours of commercial-free MTV rock videos, 
along with other material pirated from satellites. 
</P>
<P>
The private station followed up with a brief business show of its own, then 
segued into coverage of European soccer, a Polish passion. State television, 
meanwhile, droned on with another talking head, the minister of labor 
illuminating the economic situation. Echo TV settled in for prime time with an 
American car-chase movie called "Police Special." As the evening's programming 
drew to an end, cops busted bad guys on Echo TV while state television treated 
viewers to a Russian-language lesson. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely can fill gaps that Polish television creates," said Pacha, who 
made his career as an announcer on state television in Wroclaw. "We think we 
are going to make money. Otherwise we wouldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Although there are no Nielsen ratings, there are signs that Wroclawians are 
tuning in Echo TV. Shortly after the station started broadcasting, virtually 
everything resembling a television antenna in Wroclaw was sold out of the 
shops. An usually large number of people have been spotted dragging wires 
around on their roofs. (To receive the station you either have to swivel your 
old antenna or rig a new one.) 
</P>
<P>
Back in Warsaw, the Polish capital, state television is in trouble. Not only is 
it often boring, but many viewers continue to regard it as a morally bankrupt 
holdover from a Communist government that in 1981 imposed martial law, fired 
scores of journalists and required all others to "verify" their loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
Since Solidarity took over the government last fall, a gradual effort has been 
made to spruce up this image. One-third of the managers and directors of 
television have been replaced and a full reorganization is coming in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the money-strapped Solidarity government, which is in the 
throes of radical free-market reforms, is searching for ways to make television 
pay for itself. An idea has been floated in parliament to sell state 
television's Channel 2 to foreigners. This notion reportedly has traumatized 
the staff at Channel 2. The bureaucracy there is bracing for a fight; protests 
are being organized. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at Echo TV in Wroclaw, there is endless room for free-market 
innovation. 
</P>
<P>
"We are planning to be very flexible in our programming. If, for example, a 
person decides that he wants to broadcast his wedding, we will do it. Or, to 
give another example, if a person loses his passport, he could come on our 
channel and make a personal appeal. We would charge between 50,000 and 100,000 
zlotys ($5 to $10)," said Pacha, who has loaned the station the use of his own 
home video equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The station has 12 employees, 11 of whom work for free. The remaining one, a 
television technician trained at a state telecommunications institute, said his 
salary is "what they will give me." The broadcast power of Echo TV is about 500 
times less than Warsaw's Channel 1. News programming currently amounts to zero 
minutes per day. Long-range plans envision a five-minute daily news show. 
</P>
<P>
The station's corporate strategy for technological improvements can be summed 
up in one word: begging. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like the possibility of getting some outdated equipment from abroad. 
We have information that such equipment is being thrown out in the United 
States. They should send it to us and we will fix it," said Andrzej Zygmunt, 
director and head of technical services at Echo TV. 
</P>
<P>
Zygmunt, who is in his late thirties, is a can-do kind of guy with a small 
brown mustache and a big brown briefcase full of screwdrivers and 
profit-and-loss charts. He may be the only television executive in the world 
who built the transmitter of the station he directs. He built his first radio 
at age 10 and has a doctorate in microwave transmission. As a teacher at the 
Wroclaw Institute of Telecommunications and Acoustics, he has specialized in 
communication satellites. 
</P>
<P>
It is a satellite dish -- Echo TV has one -- that so far is the station's major 
source of programming, and of potential legal trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"We are profoundly aware that we shouldn't pirate television programs, although 
state television does it all the time," Zygmunt said. 
</P>
<P>
Echo TV rebroadcasts programs without express written permission from MTV, Sky 
News and the Eurosport Channel. Zygmunt said the station has received "verbal 
permission" for using MTV and is trying to sign written agreements so it can 
operate in accord with international regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"With all that has happened politically in Poland, we are a civilized European 
country again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While international broadcast law is a concern for Zygmunt and his colleagues, 
there is a higher law that the station cannot afford to appear to be violating, 
at least while the Roman Catholic cardinal of Wroclaw, Henryk Gulbinowicz, is 
watching. 
</P>
<P>
In Poland, the Catholic Church is a formidable moral and political force. It 
helped bring down the Communist government, and smart Polish businessmen know 
it can raise heck with profits. 
</P>
<P>
So, when Zygmunt was getting ready to go on the air with Echo TV early in 
February and Gulbinowicz called him in for a little chat, the broadcast 
executive showed up promptly and listened carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"He warned us against spreading pornography and he congratulated us on our 
station. He said that private television in the West gained viewers through 
pornography. He said that this may be the simplest and cheapest way, but he 
expressed the hope that we would not travel down that road," Zygmunt said. 
</P>
<P>
His station has heeded the cardinal's warning and not broadcast pornographic 
films, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But as Echo TV expands its broadcast schedule into the early morning hours, 
past the bedtime of likely critics, Zygmunt says it probably will put some 
mildly erotic fare on the air.

LEGISLATORS TOADY TO CHICKENS, MARMOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MITCHELL LANDSBERG, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You probably didn't know that the national welfare was threatened by an 
epidemic of toad-licking. You might not be aware that people are scaring the 
very life out of the chickens of America. 
</P>
<P>
Don't panic. While you've been blithely ignoring the world's problems, state 
legislators around the nation have been earning their pay by discovering these 
and other predicaments -- some more serious than others -- and boldly trying to 
solve them. 
</P>
<P>
Bills have been introduced this year to exempt ostrich steaks from California's 
state sales tax, to improve campaign manners in New Mexico and to encourage 
people to beat up flag burners in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
"Potty parity" for women is the goal of bills in Pennsylvania and Maryland. The 
bills would require more toilets for women to eliminate the long lines that 
form outside women's restrooms in stadiums, convention halls and other public 
places. 
</P>
<P>
There have been proposals to designate the "senior hoary marmot" at the 
Anchorage Zoo as the official State Marmot of Alaska, the yucca moth as the 
official State Insect of Colorado, and -- we're not making this up -- the 
Crider soil series as the official State Soil of Kentucky, the Houdek soil as 
the official State Soil of South Dakota and the Kalkaska soil series as the 
official State Soil of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia legislators are considering a proposal to give lottery tickets to 
motorists who use their seat belts. A generous legislator in Indiana wanted to 
pay citizens $25, in the form of an income tax credit, for voting. 
</P>
<P>
And a state senator in New Mexico proposed creating a new county -- named after 
him. 
</P>
<P>
You might be tempted to believe that all is not serious in America's 
legislatures. But that would be ignoring some of the issues facing elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out, for instance, that there are people who get their kicks licking 
toads. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, South American cane toads 
secrete a hallucinogenic toxin that can get the licker as high as a tree frog. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators in Georgia and South Carolina have introduced bills to outlaw the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
"They say these frogs grow to the size of a dinner plate," said horrified Rep. 
Pat Harris of South Carolina. "I don't want to see somebody walk across the 
Statehouse grounds with a frog on a leash and pick him up and lick him." 
</P>
<P>
You may laugh, but only until you consider the plight of the common chicken. 
</P>
<P>
One of Harris' colleagues, Rep. Larry Koon, has introduced a bill making it 
illegal in South Carolina to fire a gun within 300 yards of a chicken coop. 
</P>
<P>
The sound of gunshot, it seems, can cause chickens to lose their vaunted 
self-composure, jump into a pile and suffocate each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, one of Mr. Koon's constituents had chickens in a house," explained 
Rep. Tom Rhoad. "Someone had a dove shoot in the field right next to the 
chicken house. And the guns fired and caused the chickens to huddle up in a 
corner, and the farmer lost over 1,000 chickens." 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the plight of whales and turtles. Environmentalists say 
helium-filled balloons like the ones released by the thousands at football 
halftime shows can drift out to sea, pop and shower their remnants into the 
water for whales and turtles to eat. The balloons can kill them. 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, a bill was introduced in the Tennessee Senate to prohibit 
the launching of clusters of more than 24 balloons at sporting events or 
political conventions unless the balloons disintegrate in water -- but the 
author of the bill made one little mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, as written, would allow one cluster of 24 balloons for every person 
at an event -- which means that as many as 2.3 million balloons could be 
released from the University of Tennessee Neyland Stadium at a single game. 
</P>
<P>
The popping alone would be enough to give a chicken the shakes.

CLEANUP RESCUING BOSTON HARBOR, ALBATROSS OF '88 RACE;

<P>
Standing on a knoll on Deer Island gives one a spectacular view of Boston's 
skyline. The glass-walled towers glisten in the morning sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Across this 2-mile expanse is the harbor that George Bush called the dirtiest 
body of water in America during the 1988 presidential campaign. It is so dirty, 
he said, that the tea Colonial tax protesters dumped there more than 200 years 
ago would disintegrate immediately today. 
</P>
<P>
Although the water does not look polluted from a distance, 500 million gallons 
of poorly treated waste water is piped into the harbor every day from the 
21-year-old Deer Island sewage-treatment plant. In addition, 500,000 gallons of 
sludge, or sewage solids, is partially treated and dumped into the harbor 
daily. Other pollutants are industrial wastes, including PCBs, chemicals known 
to cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Some fish survive these waters because they have adapted to the poisonous 
conditions, but workers on Deer Island said that no one would eat them. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen them pulled out with all kinds of sores on their bodies," said Keith 
McCoy, legislative assistant for the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, 
the quasi-state agency responsible for water and sewage services. 
</P>
<P>
Under a 1986 federal court order to clean up the harbor by 2000, the water 
authority is in the midst of a $6-billion public works project. 
</P>
<P>
Agency officials say they have made a lot of headway on the cleanup since Bush 
used the problem to embarrass his Democratic opponent, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, 
during the presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"It just boggles the mind when you think about the magnitude of this project," 
said Paul DiNatale of the 5-year-old water and sewer agency. "Just for the cost 
of the treatment plant alone, we could send a man to the moon." 
</P>
<P>
The project received little notice until $20 million earmarked for the Boston 
Harbor cleanup was deleted from President Bush's budget for fiscal 1990-91. The 
cut set off yet another verbal duel between the former rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has appropriated $100 million for the Boston Harbor cleanup, of which 
$60 million has been disbursed. The water resources agency said that it hopes 
Congress will restore the $20 million cut out of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Levy, the water authority's executive director, said it was sad that the 
people of Massachusetts will be the ones to suffer if the $20 million is not 
restored. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, agency officials said, work will proceed on what will be one of the 
largest sewage-treatment plants in the world. It will be able to handle more 
than a billion gallons of sewage a day. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the works are new primary and secondary sewage treatment plants and two 
effluent tunnels, one of which will be 24 feet in diameter and stretch 9 miles 
out to sea from Deer Island. The largest tunnel of its kind in the world, it 
will be bored through solid rock 400 feet below sea level. 
</P>
<P>
In the primary treatment process, about 40% of the contaminants, mostly solids, 
are removed. In the secondary process, the sewage emerges 90% clean and the 
rest is cleansed naturally in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Already, $120 million worth of construction has been completed or started and 
the authority recently borrowed $800 million for more work, including repairs 
on sewer lines in the 43 cities and towns the water resources agency serves in 
eastern Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
The new plant will be built on 200-acre Deer Island. A medium-security state 
prison and an archaic sewage-treatment plant there will be torn down. 
</P>
<P>
The old primary treatment plant has had regular pump failures and several 
serious leaks. A major leak flooded the plant three years ago, and two frogmen 
spent several days diving in raw sewage to seal the pipe. 
</P>
<P>
DiNatale said that a $27-million pier on the island is almost completed, so 
that 2,000 workers and millions of tons of construction equipment and materials 
can be ferried to the island from a staging area in the suburb of Quincy, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
DiNatale said that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency can back up Bush's 
statement that Boston Harbor is the dirtiest in the nation. The water authority 
concedes that in its project brochures, and DiNatale keeps a bottle of murky 
harbor water on his desk as a reminder of the challenge the agency faces. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Belaga, a former Connecticut legislator who heads the EPA's New England 
office, said she is convinced that the water authority's cleanup program "is 
moving along in a very timely fashion." 
</P>
<P>
She added, however: "I firmly believe that the reason they are is because there 
is a judge standing there, saying it will happen." 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge ordered that a schedule be produced for the cleanup after 
Quincy, the Conservation Law Foundation of New England and the EPA filed a 
lawsuit against Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the water authority complied with the first order: removal of 
surface scum. Beginning by the end of next year, the agency is to remove sludge 
from the harbor bottom through an interim program until a new primary 
sewage-treatment plant is completed in 1995. By 2000, a secondary treatment 
plant must be in operation.

CHILDREN LEARN LESSONS BY STAYING AWAY FROM SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: UP TO A MILLION AMERICAN FAMILIES MAINTAIN HOME-SCHOOLS WHERE THEIR 
CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT. THEIR MOTIVE IS USUALLY RELIGIOUS.

<P>
In the living room of the modest two-story farmhouse of Peter and Ruth Nobel, 
five children are gathered around a piano and singing hymns. 
</P>
<P>
The music signals the start of the school day for Charity, Luke, Hope, Samuel 
and Hannah Nobel. It also symbolizes the type of education their parents want 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to live a God-centered life," Ruth Nobel said. "It seems like the 
public schools elevate man and his reasoning above all things, where we 
consider God's word to be the final authority." 
</P>
<P>
The Nobels, members of an independent Reformed church, consider public schools 
to be un-Christian places that do a mediocre job of educating. They also find a 
nearby Christian school unacceptable because of doctrinal differences. 
</P>
<P>
They are among up to a million American families teaching their children at 
home, said Chris Klicka, senior counsel for the Home School Legal Defense Assn. 
in Paeoian Springs, Va. The association offers legal assistance to 
home-schoolers for a $100 annual fee. 
</P>
<P>
Many cite religious reasons for keeping their children out of public schools, 
and some end up in court, said Klicka, whose group is involved in more than 30 
cases nationwide protesting state restrictions on home-schoolers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're gaining ground," he said. "Thirty-one states have passed bills 
permitting schooling at home, and 29 have done so since 1982." 
</P>
<P>
Michigan and Iowa remain the most restrictive states, with laws requiring 
certified teachers, Klicka said. Home-schoolers also object to laws in other 
states that require such things as teacher competence tests or college degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan's law is being challenged in a case pending before the Michigan 
Supreme Court and has been altered by previous court decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Shane, education consultant for the Michigan Department of Education, said 
recent court decisions require the state to give teaching permits to people 
with bachelor's degrees, even if they lack teaching certificates. 
</P>
<P>
Parents who ask for a permit must report the names of the children being taught 
and the curriculum being used, Shane said. 
</P>
<P>
About 700 filed reports this year, but Klicka said many never report for fear 
of being taken to court. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Nobel, a college graduate who won a court ruling allowing her to teach at 
home, began teaching her children more than 11 years ago with 22-year-old 
Abigail and now with 3-year-old Hannah. 
</P>
<P>
The Nobel children begin their day with chores on the family's 77-acre dairy 
farm about 25 miles south of Grand Rapids. Then they gather in the living room 
at 9 a.m. for hymns while Charity, 17, accompanies them on the piano. 
</P>
<P>
The children grab their books and scatter to their separate study areas on the 
floors of their bedrooms, at the dining-room table or in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless I have a problem, I don't even go downstairs. I just work by myself. In 
a way, that's better," said Charity, who does her schoolwork sitting 
cross-legged on the floor of her tidy bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Economics, history, biology, government, algebra, English literature, typing 
and Bible fill about five hours of her day. The younger children spend about 
three hours a day on their studies. 
</P>
<P>
Downstairs, Ruth Nobel spends a few minutes with each child. 
</P>
<P>
Hope, at the dining-room table, recites for her mother a portion of "The 
Midnight Ride of Paul Revere," which the 11-year-old sixth-grader has 
memorized. Then she takes a science test. 
</P>
<P>
Luke, 14, has read a story at a small desk at the end of his bed and Ruth Nobel 
quizzes him about it. 
</P>
<P>
Then the older children work independently while Ruth Nobel helps Samuel, a 
7-year-old first-grader, read a story about Jesus walking on water. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that they get the basics," said Ruth Nobel, who has found herself 
brushing up on algebra and chemistry to stay ahead of her students. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the children's books and work sheets come from the Christian Liberty 
Academy in Arlington Heights, Ill., a private school that also operates a 
correspondence school for parents who teach their children at home. 
</P>
<P>
The children follow a school year similar to a traditional school. They get 
report cards four times a year and take standardized achievement tests used by 
many traditional schools. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent round of tests, their scores were at or above grade level in all 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
"They aren't being compared with other children their age," said Ruth Nobel, 
who has taught as many as seven children at once. "They move at their pace and 
aren't really that much aware that they are behind or ahead of others." 
</P>
<P>
One daughter is attending Calvin College in Grand Rapids and another graduated 
as a nurse. Ruth Nobel says they were as well-prepared as their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a few things they had to catch up on, such as science laboratory 
work, but it was by no means impossible," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The children's studies are supplemented by trips to the library, occasional 
field trips with other home-schooling families, softball games and volleyball 
matches.

DISPUTE OVER BACTERIA DANGERS OF DISPOSABLE DIAPERS LINGERS

A study commissioned by the diaper service industry suggests that disposable 
diapers may harbor bacteria that cause polio, meningitis and hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, says T. Scott Stewart, chief spokesman for Procter &amp; Gamble, a 
major manufacturer of disposable diapers. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart says the National Assn. of Diaper Services paid $15,000 for that study 
and it has been discredited. Nonetheless, the suggestion continues to crop up 
in news stories about the great diaper wars. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalist Jeanne Wirka claims that the report has not been discredited 
and research is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
However, Stewart has on his side the fact that there is no evidence that any 
case of polio, hepatitis or meningitis was ever caused by disposable diapers, 
and some European countries have been using them for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
He also says there is 1,000 times more pet fecal matter entombed in landfills 
than infant leavings on the disposable diaper.

FRIENDS FORCED TO PAPER OVER THEIR DIFFERENCES WHEN DECIDING ON DIAPERS

Even friends disagree about disposable diapers, especially if they are mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Sandie Lange of St. Paul, Minn., an environmentally conscious new mother, 
lasted about three weeks using cloth diapers when her first child, a daughter 
named Kristen, was born. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just too much," said Lange, 23. "I'll recycle all of my newspapers, 
wash out all of my cans and bottles, but I'm not going back to the '50s." 
</P>
<P>
Lange says that when her former supervisor, herself the mother of two, picks up 
little Kristen, she often frowns and says: "Oh, no, she's in Pampers again." 
</P>
<P>
"We get into little arguments but they're not serious," Lange said. "You know, 
she's a save-the-whales kind of person. She uses cloth diapers on both of her 
children. It just didn't work out for us."

STATES CONSIDER PINNING TAXES ON THROWAWAYS

<P>
Laws aimed at curbing widespread use of disposable diapers, blamed for 
aggravating waste-disposal problems, are being debated in a dozen states, and 
an outright ban has been proposed for Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the bills have little chance of becoming law, at least this year. In 
Florida, a bill was withdrawn pending further study of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the proposals call for a tax on throwaway diapers. In corn-growing 
states, biodegradable diapers are being pushed because corn is used in their 
manufacture. 
</P>
<P>
In Colorado, for instance, a bill to tax disposables 0.25 cents per diaper was 
sent off to three committees -- usually the kiss of death. 
</P>
<P>
"That baby's going to go down like a burning kite, if I know the Colorado 
Legislature," said one veteran reporter. 
</P>
<P>
He knew his legislature. The bill was killed in its first day of hearings. 
</P>
<P>
In New Hampshire, a plan co-sponsored by Deborah Arnie Arnesen, Democrat from 
Orford, would levy a tax of 10 cents a diaper. No, she doesn't think it will 
pass in this session. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very industrial state," said Arnesen, a mother of four. "Procter 
&amp; Gamble could come in here and run for governor and win. We don't even 
have a bottle (deposit-refund) law. It would be almost irrational for something 
to pass the first time around. There isn't enough time to assess the 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Isn't a 10-cent tax a little steep? 
</P>
<P>
"It's politics," she said. "You ask for the sun, the moon and the stars and 
then you compromise down. 
</P>
<P>
"When it gets to the point that a family may save $15 a week by using a diaper 
service, and when some good marketers come in here, then maybe people will 
start to use cloth diapers at least part of the time." 
</P>
<P>
Arnesen said she would be the first to oppose a state ban on disposables. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't ignore the convenience factor," she said. "When I brought my 
5-week-old daughter to the Legislature with me, I wasn't about to ask committee 
members to sit in a smelly room. It was enough they put up with the baby." 
</P>
<P>
Other states that have or are considering diaper legislation include New York, 
Connecticut, Oregon, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Washington, Hawaii, Ohio and Kentucky.

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was refreshing to read Mr. Crotty's commentary on environmentalism ("More 
Doesn't Necessarily Mean Better," Feb. 25) because it was the first time that I 
have found someone in the matrix of local politics that recognizes some of the 
social complexity in this issue. 
</P>
<P>
At the base of the problems created by environmentalism in government, in the 
media and in movement and establishment environmental politics is that most 
spokesmen for all of these institutions are far from knowledgeable about 
ecology as a science, or in knowing what constitutes scientific facts and how 
those arguments are made. That is, there are few real scientists in any of 
these institutional configurations, and because of that there is no way that 
there can be a real evaluation of technical or scientific information by any of 
these groups of people. Mr. Crotty well knows, having worked for the EPA, that 
there are very few scientists actually working for that agency, most are 
bureaucrats or engineers with MBAs or law degrees and rarely do they seek out 
real information. They don't have to, they are regulators, policemen enforcing 
environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
Instead governments contract out their scientific decision making to 
entrepreneurial environmental consultants. The environmental impact statements 
that were demanded in the legislation of the 1970s have been a lucrative market 
for pseudoscientific entrepreneurs. And nowhere in the implementation of the 
legislation has there been any process to insure scientific accountability 
either in the way these EIS documents are prepared or in the evaluation of the 
information after government gets it. 
</P>
<P>
William K. Reilly, director of the Environmental Protection Agency, himself is 
a lawyer, not an ecologist. If you look at the boards of directors in national 
environmental movements, they are top heavy with lawyers and "conservationists" 
but not scientists. Added to that is the appalling state of scientific literacy 
in the general public; there is no mechanism anywhere to insure that the 
information being debated to set environmental priorities has been selected 
with any intelligence. And clearly a lot of it has not, and I'm afraid that we 
are going to see more and more of this. 
</P>
<P>
I applaud Mr. Crotty for his contribution to the debate. I hope we can continue 
to have it.

VALLEY CENTER STANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Ray's article (Feb. 26) on the growth debate in Valley Center deserves 
comment. The headline stating that "Newcomers Foil Plans to Fill Town's Core 
With High-Density Housing" is patently untrue. 
</P>
<P>
The statement that "slow-growth newcomers, who now make up a voting majority" 
implies that old-time residents support development. Nothing could be further 
from the truth. As a 15-year resident, I feel I can speak for the many people I 
know who have lived here for many years and feel the same way I do. You would 
be hard-pressed to find anyone who supports development in Valley Center except 
those who stand to profit by it. The rest of us longtime residents will pay the 
price as our quality of life deteriorates. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime residents moved here because they preferred a "country lifestyle." 
People who want the amenities of a city can live in Escondido. The majority of 
Valley Center residents have shown through the election process that they 
unequivocally support the slow-growth force. I submit that this majority was 
composed of mostly longtime Valley Center residents, in addition to the 
relatively few newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
Let the majority rule.

to Assume Control of Jails," Feb. 18). Nowhere, however, does The Times 
indicate how such a move would solve the horrendous problems associated with 
our local detention system. The Times, which also publishes editions in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties, suggests this transfer of responsibility only in 
San Diego. Apparently jails operated by the sheriffs of the other Southern 
California counties seem to be very acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
The principal area of concern appears to be accountability. We should not 
forget that the elected sheriff is accountable to the very people that the 
elected members of the Board of Supervisors are responsible to -- the people. 
Accountability of elected officials is the cornerstone of a democratic 
governmental system. 
</P>
<P>
As for the board's continuous concern for financial accountability of the 
sheriff, let us not forget that no one has ever asserted that the local jail 
system is funded as it should be. Isn't it somewhat incongruent to demand 
financial accountability on the part of the sheriff while at the same time 
claiming there is insufficient money available to provide even an adequate 
level of security staff? 
</P>
<P>
If county sheriffs can operate jails in the vast majority of other California 
counties, surely, with proper funding and support, the sheriff of San Diego 
County can do likewise. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than spend valuable time, effort and public money creating a new 
Department of Corrections, the board, county staff and the sheriff should be 
working in concert to solve our problems. The Board of Supervisors may well be 
able to utilize the political power of the sheriff as an ally in its fight for 
the redistribution of tax revenues to this county. It is far better to take on 
Sacramento with a single focus and a unified front than a fragmented, 
quarrelsome team that won't walk on the same field together. 
</P>
<P>
A county Department of Corrections holds no promise to solve existing problems. 
A well focused team effort on the part of all county elected officials is the 
promise of the future.

CLASH OVER TRASH BRINGS HEFTY LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palos Verdes Estates residents like their city to look spiffy. So much so, in 
fact, that the city has a law that makes it illegal to leave trash where the 
public can see it, even on trash day. 
</P>
<P>
But a local couple say the city unfairly used the law to dump on them. Indeed, 
Clyde and Nona Emery have filed a $6.9-million lawsuit that accuses the city of 
harassment because police ticketed them twice for leaving trash in public view 
and hauled Clyde Emery, a heart surgeon, off to jail when he refused to sign 
one of the citations. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to us that two or three Hefty trash bags don't warrant that kind of 
action," said the couple's attorney, Peter Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, city officials are mum on the matter because it is in 
litigation. Police Chief Gary Johansen, however, told a local newspaper shortly 
after Clyde Emery was locked up last September that the city had received 
numerous complaints about the couple leaving large bags full of trash in front 
of their home. 
</P>
<P>
And City Manager James Hendrickson says the misdemeanor tickets were given to 
the couple only after attempts were made to reason with them and a written 
warning had been issued. 
</P>
<P>
That's rubbish, say the Emerys, who are letting Anderson do their talking for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson says that to understand the couple's predicament, one has to go back 
to 1988 when a jury awarded the Emerys $1.7 million from the city after 
determining that municipal storm drains undermined the property on which the 
couple's home sits. 
</P>
<P>
But the city is appealing the verdict, and Anderson contends the Emerys are 
being harassed over where they place their trash because the city wants them to 
settle for less money. Moreover, he says that the city knew from the outset 
that it was liable for the damage to the couple's property and should never 
have made them go through a long, costly trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the city or some of its employees . . . don't like the Emerys very 
much," Anderson said. "They think the Emerys are troublemakers, (that) the 
Emerys are a thorn in the side of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson says the first ticket was issued last August. Around midnight, a squad 
car pulled up to the couple's home. The officer got out and told Nona Emery 
that she and her husband were being cited for leaving four tied bags of grass 
clippings in public view. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the Emerys went on vacation for two weeks, forgetting to tell the 
gardener to place any future bagged clippings out of public view, Anderson 
says. When they returned, they were paid another visit by police. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Emery -- armed with a camera and tape recorder to document the incident, 
went outside and was told by officers that he and his wife were being cited a 
second time for placing grass clippings in public view. When Clyde Emery 
refused to sign the citation, the officers handcuffed him and took him to jail. 
(The district attorney subsequently declined to prosecute him.) 
</P>
<P>
Anderson says the Emerys have lived in Palos Verdes Estates for 11 years, and 
they routinely put their garden and lawn clippings near the curb on the night 
before the trash is collected. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he says it is a common practice for other residents to also put their 
bagged clippings on the curb. A recent poll he conducted showed that on trash 
day, Tuesday, 35 homeowners within a mile of the Emerys had left clippings 
within public view. 
</P>
<P>
One resident, Gar Goodson, says his neighbors typically adhere to the city's 
trash ordinance, but, on occasion, even he puts a bag or two of garden 
clippings on the curb. Another resident, who did not want to be identified, 
says he lives within a stone's throw of police headquarters and sometimes puts 
a trash can out on the curb. No one, he says, "has blown the whistle." 
</P>
<P>
"That's crazy," he said of the citations issued to the Emerys. "It sounds like 
overkill to me." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson says the Emerys recently rejected an offer of $1.8 million by the city 
to settle the lawsuit over their property. When the jury rendered the 
$1.7-million decision in 1988, it also ruled that the property was worth 
$400,000 in 1983. Given the years that have elapsed, Anderson says the Emerys 
believe that the property is now worth much more and that they should receive 
well over $2 million in compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the recent citations, however, they no longer are leaving their 
clippings on the curb. All the couple wants, Anderson says, is to end their 
legal battles with the city and move elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the circumstances they have been subjected to, they don't believe Palos 
Verdes is as hospitable as it once was."

EL CAMINO 2ND IN ACADEMIC DECATHLON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A team from Laguna Hills High School in Orange County edged out El Camino Real 
High School of Woodland Hills to win the California Academic Decathlon, 
officials announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Hills team finished fifth in the Decathlon "Super Quiz" on Friday 
and was not considered to be a top contender for the overall title. Team member 
Jeff DeWit, 17, of Laguna Hills said he and his teammates arrived at the awards 
ceremonies Saturday hoping at best for a spot among the top five teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Hills team scored 45,361 points in the two-day academic contest to 
beat second-place finisher El Camino Real, which scored 44,829. 
</P>
<P>
"This is so amazing," said Laguna Hills team captain Jeff McCombs. "We knew 
we'd be in the top five, but we didn't know how close we were." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the El Camino Real team, representing the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, were disappointed with their second-place finish. Some cried after 
the announcement of the winner. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it was going to be close, but I'm proud of all my kids," said Coach 
Mark Johnson. "Part of the emotion is that it's over, that after spending so 
many hours together, it's finally over." Despite their disappointment, team 
members echoed Johnson's sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost to a great team so we can't feel bad about it," said El Camino Real 
team member Jon Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
This year's state contest drew about 500 students and coaches from 46 teams 
representing counties throughout California. The 10-event academic contest, 
which is held over two days, tests students in subjects such as music, 
mathematics and economics. 
</P>
<P>
The Academic Decathlon's Super Quiz, which is held in a gymnasium full of 
supporters, tests student knowledge as well as the ability to perform under 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-area teams have won the Super Quiz in the last six contests, with 
two Los Angeles city schools also winning national titles in the last three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
John Marshall High School in Silver Lake beat the Texas state champion team in 
1987 to win the U.S. Academic Decathlon. Taft High School in Woodland Hills 
placed second in the national contest the next year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Taft again won the state decathlon and went on to win the national 
title. 
</P>
<P>
The El Camino Real team defeated 54 other Los Angeles city teams to win the 
district title in November. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-member Academic Decathlon teams are by contest rules composed of equal 
numbers of A, B and C students. The statewide contest was first held in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Hills team beat 49 other Orange County schools to win the county 
competition in November. Last year's Laguna Hills team also won the county 
title, but it finished fifth in the state competition. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills Coach Kathy Lane said that after the announcements of a large 
number of individual medal winners on her team, "We knew we were in the hunt." 
She and Roger Gunderson have coached the Academic Decathlon team since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Hills team now advances to the U.S. Academic Decathlon in Des 
Moines, Iowa, next month. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson High School, in Hacienda Heights, finished first in the Super Quiz. The 
team, which represented Los Angeles County, finished fourth in the overall 
contest behind third-place winner Palo Alto High School of Santa Clara County. 
Laguna Hills finished third in the Super Quiz. 
</P>
<P>
Ananp Sahai, 17, a senior at Thousand Oaks High School in Ventura County, had 
the highest overall point total in all categories.

CRIME-WATCH GROUPS BATTLE APATHY WITH VARIETY OF PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fires were being set almost nightly on Bellingham Avenue in North 
Hollywood. A few cars had been burned, trash in some bins set afire. The damage 
was never high, and no one was ever hurt. But it was scary. There was an 
arsonist out there, somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
So neighborhood residents did what residents often do when crime directly 
threatens their neighborhood: They contacted police and organized a 
Neighborhood Watch group. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 5, just 10 days after their first meeting, four group members spotted a 
man leaving an apartment garage where a fire had just been started. They 
followed and watched him until firefighters and police arrived. He was arrested 
for arson. 
</P>
<P>
Though the capture of a suspect is perhaps the ultimate trophy for a 
Neighborhood Watch program, the fledgling group still faces perhaps its most 
difficult task: staying in existence. 
</P>
<P>
Despite many residents who attend Neighborhood Watch meetings across the San 
Fernando Valley each year, police and civic activists say they continually face 
the challenge of keeping people interested and involved after the immediate 
threat of crime is gone. Indeed, Bellingham Avenue had a Neighborhood Watch 
years earlier, but it died for lack of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to get people to see the value of staying involved when the 
crime situation is not that bad," said Richard Beltran, a longtime Neighborhood 
Watch coordinator in the low-crime Chatsworth area. "It's when crime gets close 
to them that they get interested." 
</P>
<P>
To keep citizens involved, the Neighborhood Watch concept has evolved to 
include a variety of programs that go past the basic crime-watch philosophy, 
ranging from earthquake response to drug awareness. 
</P>
<P>
People who attend group meetings are just as likely to hear a city official 
tell them how to get rid of abandoned cars or how they can get a stop sign for 
their corner as they are to hear a police officer providing a rundown on recent 
crime in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Though the focus of Neighborhood Watch remains crime prevention and the 
partnership of residents with police, incidents in which residents help police 
capture suspects, as on Bellingham Avenue, are rare. 
</P>
<P>
"That's icing on the cake," said Stephanie Tapper, coordinator of the 
Neighborhood Watch group started after the Bellingham Avenue fires. "It is not 
our day-to-day contribution." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police say it is difficult to gauge how many residents in the city 
are actively involved in Neighborhood Watch. Officer James Cypert, assistant 
officer in charge of the department's crime prevention operations, said police 
do not have up-to-date membership statistics. Attendance at meetings is the 
best indicator of involvement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the number of Neighborhood Watch meetings and attendance has 
fluctuated. In 1986, there were 5,003 meetings with 235,000 residents in 
attendance. In 1988, the most recent year for which citywide records were 
available, there were more meetings but fewer attendees: 5,137 meetings at 
which 220,000 people took part. 
</P>
<P>
But police concede that the attendance figures don't provide a look at how many 
people remain steadfastly involved and how many drift away. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers who coordinate Neighborhood Watch in the Valley said new groups 
are started every month. Occasionally, the groups restart in places, such as 
Bellingham Avenue, where old watch groups have fallen apart. New housing 
developments and the rapidly changing makeup of neighborhoods bring new 
residents who seek the sense of protection a Neighborhood Watch program offers. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the newly built Autumn Ridge townhouse community in Sylmar started 
a group last month. Sheila Lebowitz, the group's coordinator, said the program 
gives residents of the gated development a chance to meet each other and become 
"familiar with who belongs here and who doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
"We think it is a crime prevention step we have to take," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Police estimate that more than 3,000 residents attend Neighborhood Watch 
meetings in the Valley each month. The block clubs, as they are called, run the 
gamut from dedicated groups that meet at least once monthly to those that 
rarely meet. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Gary Merrifield, in charge of community relations at the Los Angeles 
Police Department's Foothill Division, said there are about 400 Neighborhood 
Watch groups in the police division, which encompasses Sylmar, Pacoima, Lake 
View Terrace, Sunland and Tujunga. But, he said, only about 20 are "fire 
breathers" -- groups that continually remain "super-active" in crime 
prevention. 
</P>
<P>
The rest are mostly groups that formed when a specific problem, such as a rash 
of burglaries, hit a neighborhood, and are now only sporadically active. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as they get their clubs together, and they solve the immediate crime 
problems, they have a tendency to become non-existent," Merrifield said. "Most 
are not as active as we would like them to be." 
</P>
<P>
Programs elsewhere in the Valley experience a similar response. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the groups don't stay active. It's a problem," said Community 
Relations Officer Iain Hamilton, who organizes Neighborhood Watch meetings in 
the West Valley. "Most people are concerned with what is happening right at the 
moment. Once they feel secure, it goes by." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the tendency for people to drop out, those dedicated to Neighborhood 
Watch persist in efforts to get more residents involved. 
</P>
<P>
Tapper, head of the Bellingham Avenue group, said attendance at the first 
meeting after the arson suspect was caught dropped by a third. But she is 
planning meetings at which disaster preparedness will be discussed, a 
neighborhood earthquake plan will be formed and residents can learn how to get 
the city to paint crosswalks on their streets. 
</P>
<P>
She said the fledgling group already has a newsletter in the works. And 
questionnaires passed among those attending meetings will provide information 
to help steer the group toward topics and problems that will keep residents 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
"From the beginning we were aware of the problem of people dropping out," 
Tapper said. "Now that our problem has been taken care of, we have to keep the 
interest going. We are going to have to stimulate them in many ways. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to make everyone aware that they are very important participants. If 
the Neighborhood Watch becomes a way through which people can know what is 
happening in their neighborhood, then they will stay involved." 
</P>
<P>
The approach of the new group has worked elsewhere, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Annette Banda, an aide to City Councilman Hal Bernson who helps police 
coordinate Neighborhood Watch programs in the northwest Valley, said the area 
has a core group of about 500 residents actively involved in the program and 
5,000 more who receive a Neighborhood Watch newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
Banda said people first get involved in crime prevention programs when they see 
a specific need. But meeting other needs helps keep the momentum going. 
</P>
<P>
"We are keeping more involved because of the variety of programs we have," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Norman Dumais, who works with Foothill area community groups, said the 
added programs act as "preventive maintenance," keeping Neighborhood Watch 
groups in existence. "It helps keep the motivation there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and civic activists say their continued efforts to get citizens involved 
are because Neighborhood Watch works. They call the concept of neighbor 
watching out for neighbor the cornerstone of crime prevention. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in Neighborhood Watch are our eyes and ears out there," said Sgt. 
Robert Shallenberger, head of community relations for the Police Department's 
Van Nuys Division. "As soon as one of them picks up a phone to call us, the 
program is paying off." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the Valley, authorities point to examples -- large and small -- in 
which the program has made a difference. 
</P>
<P>
The largest Neighborhood Watch group in the Foothill area encompasses 800 homes 
in Sylmar. Since its inception six years ago, property crimes have dropped 75%, 
police say. 
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood Watch groups in Sepulveda are credited with helping to cut down 
the visibility of prostitution and narcotics sales along Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the scale there is the 7300 block of Remmet Avenue in 
Canoga Park, which police likened to a small crime-free oasis in an area rife 
with gang and drug problems. Resident Phil Weldon said he started the 
block-long watch group six years ago, after nine homes on the block were 
burglarized in one year. He said there has been only one burglary in the area 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
"All we did was introduce neighbor to neighbor," Weldon said. "We don't need 
Rambos. We just want people who can recognize a situation and call police. We 
want people who will watch out for each other, know who belongs here and who 
doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
One day last week, Weldon saw four youths walk down Remmet. Weldon said he 
immediately recognized that the four, who he suspected of being gang members, 
did not live on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"So I went out front to keep a watch, and I noticed that three of my neighbors 
suddenly had to go out and water their lawn," Weldon said. "Another guy came 
out to work on his car. These gang kids just kept bopping on down the street. 
But they started walking a little faster. That made me feel so good."

DEMOGRAPHICS: MIDDLE-CLASS LATINOS MAKE UP A MINI-COMMUNITY IN MISSION HILLS, 
MAINTAINING TIES WITH NEARBY NEIGHBORHOODS OF THEIR PASTS.

<P>
Irene Tovar still recalls the unpaved streets that turned into muddy rivers 
during rainstorms and the modest wood-frame house, where her family lived 
without water, gas or electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these memories of poverty, Tovar, now 50, even more vividly remembers 
the richness of her early youth: a close-knit family and Latino community amid 
the dusty streets of small-town Pacoima. As Tovar prospered, and she thought 
about buying a home, she faced a quandary: Did "moving up" have to mean moving 
away from her roots? 
</P>
<P>
"I love Pacoima, and I'm proud of being raised there," said Tovar, a community 
activist. "But there wasn't any housing there I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Like many other upwardly mobile Latinos in the Valley, Tovar found her solution 
in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 years, Mission Hills -- nestled among San Fernando, Pacoima and 
Granada Hills -- has become a bridge for Latinos moving out of traditional 
barrios and into the ranks of the suburban middle class. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a natural for the people in Pacoima and San Fernando to move to Mission 
Hills because it's still close to our home base," Tovar said. 
</P>
<P>
The median household income in Mission Hills is $41,000 -- about $8,000 more 
than the median for the Southern California region. And more than a quarter of 
Mission Hills' 17,000 residents are Latino, according to Times' surveys. That 
makes it one of the largest concentrations of Latinos in the San Fernando 
Valley living in an area with a moderately high per-capita income. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Hills joins other upscale Latino enclaves peppered throughout Southern 
California in communities such as Hacienda Heights and La Puente. And they are 
on the rise in Azusa, Monrovia and Arcadia, Latino activist Bert Corona said. 
</P>
<P>
The tidy streets of Mission Hills look like any other suburban community in the 
San Fernando Valley. Five minutes from the housing projects of Pacoima sit the 
cozy '50s tract homes and spacious, spotless supermarkets of Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
And that is precisely the draw, say many Latinos who live there. The community 
is removed from the problems that plague the barrio, such as crime and crowded 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Mission Hills is like a step up," said Elizabeth Sanchez, who was born in 
Pacoima and has lived in Mission Hills four years. 
</P>
<P>
But it is also accessible to the Spanish-language churches and specialty shops 
catering to a Latino clientele on the other side of the Golden State Freeway. 
It allows upwardly mobile Latinos to maintain a cultural lifeline to the 
heritage they left behind, to keep a foot in both worlds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still close to home, and the things that are familiar," said James 
Acevedo, a Mission Hills-based political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Socorro Montano, who runs a Latino market and deli with her husband, 
Bernardino, in Mission Hills, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"They're staying close by and at the same time getting out of the ghetto," she 
said. "A lot of people don't want to let go of their roots." 
</P>
<P>
Although many in the Latino community in Mission Hills say they are aware of 
the recent growth within their ranks, the larger community is only now becoming 
aware of its new residents. 
</P>
<P>
Some Latino residents surmise that this lag in awareness occurs because they do 
not meet many of the Anglo stereotypes of Latinos. Many speak unaccented 
English; some even have an "American" accent when they speak Spanish. In 
addition, most of the mom and pop shops that cater to the Latino population are 
still on the other side of the freeway in San Fernando and Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have these traditionally Hispanic physical manifestations, so people 
say, 'There are no Latinos in Mission Hills,' " Corona said. 
</P>
<P>
Acevedo made the same observation from a different perspective: 
</P>
<P>
"We fit into the system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Latino enrollment this year at the 645-student San Jose Street School 
is 6% higher than last year -- nearly 59% of the total enrollment -- Principal 
Barbara Fuller said most of the Latino children are "certainly as anglicized as 
the rest." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez was born in Pacoima and lived there until she was 5, when her family 
moved to Newhall. Her husband, Mario, a machinist in Burbank, was born in 
Mexico and came to California in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
She now lives in Mission Hills and is an assistant manager at Security Pacific 
Bank. Sanchez said she often is mistaken for an Armenian or Middle Easterner 
because of the way she looks and her unaccented English. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez and her husband began their search for a home in San Fernando because 
they wanted to be close to the traditional Latino churches and shops of the 
northeast Valley. But the neighborhoods they liked were out of their price 
range. So, they focused their hunt on Mission Hills, where home prices run from 
$190,000 to $260,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I have close ties to where my family started," she said. "I want my children 
to be around our heritage." 
</P>
<P>
The four-bedroom house they eventually found -- on a quiet cul-de-sac in the 
shadow of the Simi Valley Freeway -- looked like the perfect place to start a 
family. Four years later, they have two children: Olivia, 2, and Diego, 8 
months. 
</P>
<P>
The family attends Santa Rosa Catholic Church in San Fernando. And, when the 
children are old enough for school, they will go to one of the Catholic schools 
in San Fernando or Pacoima, Elizabeth Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just looking for a better place to live," Mario Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon of Latino mini-communities is a result of the "pull of the 
extended family," Corona explained. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a growing body of Latinos in the rising middle class that still like 
to buy where their compadres have bought," Corona said, explaining that, after 
one person buys a home in an area, many friends and family members follow. 
</P>
<P>
That suburbanization of Latinos has led some to claim that their culture is 
being watered down -- that white bread is replacing tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
But Montano and others say Latinos moving away from the barrio is part of a 
natural social progression. Many of those moving out of the barrios now were 
born in the United States and are eager to cash in on the dreams that brought 
their parents north a generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
"You want a better life," Montano said. "You left your country, what for? A 
better life." 
</P>
<P>
The pattern has venerable roots in American culture: many immigrant groups have 
made the same trek from ethnic ghettos to mainstream suburbs, said Jose 
Hernandez, a professor of urban studies at Cal State Northridge. But, because 
of California's Mexican legacy, many Latinos are reluctant to shed their 
heritage as completely as other immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexicans identify with the history of California," he said. "The culture is 
very pronounced. It's hard to get away from it." 
</P>
<P>
It is a culture that emphasizes the family and community involvement, he said, 
adding that that may be a reason many Latinos tend to congregate in particular 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"Latinos are very much searching for a community," he said. "That's part of our 
culture. Being able to talk across the fence with your neighbor -- that's very 
important." 
</P>
<P>
Acevedo agreed but said that a place like Mission Hills allows Latinos to 
maintain their roots while branching out into the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
"When you first settle in a country, you gravitate toward your own ethnic 
group, but once you become somewhat familiar with your environment, you're not 
afraid to venture from that support base," Acevedo said. "But you retain your 
roots. We can always go back to the barrio." 
</P>
<P>
Tovar does just that several times a week. 
</P>
<P>
Her home in the northeast corner of Mission Hills is less than a mile from the 
San Fernando line, and she regularly crosses the boundary to buy handmade 
tortillas at Tresierras Market. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of a place in Mission Hills where I can get good tortillas," she 
said. "Any time I want to get something that is so-called Mexican, I will go to 
San Fernando or Pacoima." 
</P>
<P>
But, as the Latino population in Mission Hills grows, that practice may change. 
Shops that cater to the new residents are beginning to pop up. 
</P>
<P>
Montano said 70% of her customers at her shop on Sepulveda Boulevard are from 
the Mission Hills "side of the tracks." The number has grown significantly 
since she moved her market and delicatessen there 13 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Non-Latino businesses also have cashed in on making themselves accessible to 
the growing Latino market. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Stanchfield, general manager of Hamer Toyota, said about 35% of his 
clientele is Latino, and he employs several Spanish-speaking salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Medina, who grew up in Arleta, always thought Mission Hills had a nice 
ring to it. "Just the name Mission Hills gives me a little more pride," said 
Medina, 42, who owns a residential carpet-cleaning service. 
</P>
<P>
Medina moved to Mission Hills in 1973 after a stint in the military. Now, as he 
watches the police helicopters hover almost nightly over the northeastern edge 
of the valley, he knows he made the right choice. 
</P>
<P>
He said he feels safer knowing that his five children will not inadvertently 
imply a gang association when they tell other youths where they live -- a risk 
they might face if they lived in other neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
It is what everybody wants, he said: a place to feel safe and raise a family. 
</P>
<P>
"Not just Hispanics, but blacks and whites want to move into a neighborhood 
like this."

5TH JAIL ESCAPEE RECAPTURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police recaptured the fifth of 13 South Bay County Jail escapees late 
Saturday afternoon within walking distance of the main police headquarters at 
14th Street and Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Williams, 25, who was in jail on suspicion of assault with a deadly 
weapon before his escape Wednesday, was found inside a camper parked in a lot 
at 15th and F streets, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
After police received a call reporting that Williams had been seen in the 
parking lot, Officers Ken Brown and Jorge Estrada made the short trip to the 
site and arrested Williams without incident, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The escapee was found inside a brown and white camper with two other persons. 
One of the other men was arrested on an outstanding felony warrant, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was returned to County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 escapees lowered themselves on bedsheets from a fourth-floor window in 
the South Bay jail's high security unit Wednesday night after they apparently 
cut through the steel bars in the windows with hacksaws smuggled in through 
windows in one of the jail's day rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The jail break, the largest in the county in modern history, brought calls for 
increased security measures from the Board of Supervisors' Chairman Leon 
Williams. He has placed a proposal for a review of security at all county jail 
facilities on the Tuesday agenda of the county board.

A motorist on the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge stopped his car in mid-span 
about 5 p.m. Saturday and jumped to his death, San Diego police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man was identified as William K. Klein, 40, of Philadelphia, by San Diego 
County Coroner Chuck Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police said that the apparent suicide victim was driving east on the 
bridge when he stopped and jumped over the side. A San Diego Harbor Police

<P>
Two persons died Saturday in separate early morning residence fires in Vista 
and in the Paradise Hills area of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The body of 91-year-old Lee James Lamoreaux was found by firefighters after 
they extinguished a fire in the elderly man's cottage in the l900 block of 
Riviera Drive in rural Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The fire destroyed the kitchen, living room and one bedroom of the single-story 
home, causing about $30,000 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
Lamoreaux's body was found in the kitchen and a wood-burning stove is suspected 
as the cause of the fire. San Diego Sheriff's Department arson investigation 
unit was called in by the Vista Fire Department to determine the cause of the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
In Paradise Hills, San Diego firefighters found the burned body of a 
37-year-old woman at a condominium at 2833 Ritva Place. A Metro Arson Strike 
Team investigation showed that the fire started when a cigarette ignited a 
couch. Damage to the apartment and its contents was estimated at $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
The county coroner's office said that identity of the victim could not be 
confirmed until dental records were received.

<P>
Two Clairemont men were seriously injured when their light plane crashed in 
rugged mountains east of Ranchita Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The injured pair were taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital by ambulance after low 
clouds forced a Life Flight helicopter to land at Warner Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter had been attempting to airlift the two to Palomar Medical Center 
in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, 69-year-old Bill Gray, was reported in serious but stable condition 
Saturday night by Sharp nursing supervisor Melanie Bruce. A 31-year-old 
passenger, who is Gray's roommate, was in critical condition Saturday night 
with head injuries and possible internal injuries, Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
Gray told hospital officials that he was flying from Borrego Springs to 
Gillespie Field in El Cajon when the plane went down about five miles east of 
Ranchita and a quarter mile north of S22, a county highway.

'DENSITY' ENOUGH FOR MONORAIL? 1 YES VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his op-ed article "Transit Options Must Deal With Real World" (Feb. 26), 
Bruce Nestande said that Orange County can't have fixed-corridor mass transit 
because its density is too low. His only suggestions are to improve the bus 
system and create more commuter lanes. 
</P>
<P>
This is not very creative, and judging by current usage, it also won't be very 
successful. In reality, higher-density development is needed only at the 
destination point for a monorail-type system to work. The origination point is 
unimportant: People can drive a mile to a collection point, park their cars and 
get on a monorail as long as it drops them off within walking distance of where 
they want to go. 
</P>
<P>
Do we have enough "density of destinations" to justify a monorail? I think so. 
That's why we already have traffic jams around South Coast Plaza, the Irvine 
Business Center, Anaheim Stadium, the 91 Corridor and other locations in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, most of these areas are next to freeways, which are the most 
logical and inexpensive rights of way available for a monorail-type system. 
</P>
<P>
It will be good advertising, too. Picture creeping along the Santa Ana Freeway 
at 5 m.p.h. in rush-hour traffic as the monorail whooshes by overhead. That, 
finally, would get people out of their cars.

DECISION TO DISARM RATHER THAN SHOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Ana police officers who responded to the domestic violence dispute 
(Feb. 19) where a man was allegedly threatening family members with a loaded 
handgun are a credit to the Police Department for not using deadly force when 
they were justified in doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever made the decision to disarm the man rather than shoot him has shown a 
fine example of restrained response. 
</P>
<P>
These officers were obviously highly skilled and their decision not to take a 
human life hopefully will encourage other officers in Orange County to follow 
their lead, especially in situations where unarmed suspects are involved.

RETURN TO SQUARE ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 18.5% of Irvine voters who bothered to go to the polls on Tuesday can't be 
faulted for overwhelmingly rejecting a $57.5-million parks measure. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed by critics "the Cadillac of bond issues," it was a virtual wish list of 
parks and recreation facilities that was far too ambitious in a time, and in a 
city, where traffic and other more serious problems must share the political 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also contained a troubling provision to pay for maintenance of new 
facilities out of bond money instead of out of the general fund, as is the 
standard municipal practice. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, which put the measure on the ballot, should use the election 
results as a guide in preparing another measure that would plan for the future 
of this fast-growing planned community on a more modest scale. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which needed two-thirds approval, was rejected by an astounding 
76%-24% margin. It had something for everybody, apparently in the hope that 
enough constituencies could be found to put it over the top. 
</P>
<P>
There were to be new parks in Woodbridge, Westpark and Northwood; senior 
citizen and child-care centers; biking, hiking, jogging and equestrian paths; 
gymnasiums; tennis courts and athletic fields, and other park improvements. 
There was even a model farm, a two-acre site complete with a farm building to 
teach visitors about Irvine's agricultural history. 
</P>
<P>
But the price tag for all of this was high: All told, the measure would have 
cost about $300 million when debt service and maintenance and operations costs 
were added to the actual cost of bonds. Each homeowner would have paid $120 a 
year, with mobile homeowners paying half that amount and commercial property 
owners paying significantly more. 
</P>
<P>
Put on the ballot by the City Council after eight months of public hearings, 
the measure had the support of two council members who are usually at odds: 
Mayor Larry Agran, a liberal Democrat, and Republican Councilwoman Sally Anne 
Sheridan. It was opposed by the Irvine Chamber of Commerce, whose members 
objected to increased taxes on their property, and by a group of political 
conservatives who don't much like Agran's style of governing. 
</P>
<P>
But it was given a chance at passage because the city's voters had shown 
themselves to be mavericks on tax issues: Irvine was the only city in Orange 
County to approve Measure M, the half-cent sales tax for transportation, on 
last November's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
While the vote on the parks measure was decisive, it should not be interpreted 
as a signal to give up on planning for the future. It is simply time to go back 
to the drawing board. This time, the council should take into account the 
economic and political realities of Irvine while it continues its tradition 
among suburban communities of providing high-caliber parks for its residents.

STORY'S UNFAIR TO BP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until the article "British Petroleum Is Accused of Dragging Its Feet" (March 1) 
appeared, I had heard nothing but praise for BP and all other agencies involved 
in the cleanup of the Feb. 7 oil spill. Beaches are now being opened, and 
everyone is congratulating each other for the containment of damages. 
</P>
<P>
One person, Reed Smith, a patrol lieutenant, was found by your reporter and had 
nothing to say but bad things about BP and its efforts to clean up our Orange 
County. This article would make more sense if we were still wallowing in oil 
around here. It sounds more like sour grapes on the part of Mr. Smith, in that 
everything was not done to his personal satisfaction and ideas as to how to 
clean things up. 
</P>
<P>
The only positive thing to counter all this negative information in the article 
was one sentence that the commandant of the Coast Guard praised BP for being a 
good corporate citizen.

MAYOR'S NOTE ON PRAYERS INSPIRES VARIED REACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In my opinion, Mayor Richard B. Edgar of Tustin is to be congratulated on his 
forthright and just proposal concerning invocations at City Council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Being of no particular religious persuasion, I can understand why others like 
myself or people of any but the Christian faith might feel left out or offended 
with the numerous references to Jesus, etc., which seem to be customary in 
invocations at most public gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly a moment of silence and contemplation at the start of each meeting 
would serve to create the desired atmosphere of seriousness and solemnity 
without causing resentment on anyone's part. I think Mayor Edgar is to be 
commended for his perception and sensitivity in this matter.

TWO PERCEPTIONS OF ANTI-DRUG RALLY FEATURING BUSH AND GATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I recently had the privilege of attending the anti-drug rally held in Santa Ana 
where President Bush was a guest speaker. My 15-year-old son also attended. I 
couldn't think of a better lesson he could learn than hearing firsthand the 
President of the United States, as well as some of his other heroes, Chuck 
Norris, Jim Everett and others, saying: "We support Sheriff (Brad) Gates' 
programs on making Orange County drug-free." Chuck Norris had to be so proud of 
his own son, Chris, for being able to speak publicly of his own past drug 
problems. It really was an incredibly moving day to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
As a parent of a teen-ager, I'd like to thank Sheriff Gates, his staff and 
Assistant Sheriff Walt Fath for caring so much about my son and the sons and 
daughters of other parents of this county. There is so much pressure on these 
teens today, that we parents need all the help we can get, to help fight this 
hideous war on drugs. And if Sheriff Gates feels so strongly about this issue, 
that he is willing and able to bring the leader of our country to talk to our 
children, then I, as a concerned parent, will do everything I can to support 
his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
When I see stories from his critics shouting their concerns about Sheriff 
Gates' possibly using secretarial time for personal business, or use of 
business phones to conduct personal business, I get really concerned. I believe 
officials have to be made accountable, and cannot have a free rein. But for 
each hour Sheriff Gates spends justifying his actions over these petty matters, 
he is not free to concentrate on programs such as the anti-drug rally. And 
frankly, I feel my son's future, and the future of the other teens of this 
community, is a whole lot more important than worrying about whether Sheriff 
Gates called a real estate agent on his business phone or went down the street 
to a pay phone.

CHILDREN ARE PAWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Negotiations between the Ocean View School District Board of Trustees and the 
Ocean View Teachers Assn. have reached an impasse. 
</P>
<P>
The board says it has given all it can; the OVTA says it isn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
One negotiator shrugs his shoulders and says nothing can be done and drives 
home to Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
The students in Ocean View School District go home and cry. Teachers have 
discontinued extracurricular programs until they have a new contract. This 
includes after-school sports and the outdoor education trips to Catalina and 
Yosemite. Some rumors include dances and graduation. 
</P>
<P>
My present eighth-grader and youngest of five has seen his older siblings make 
the trip to Yosemite and has anticipated his turn for as long as he can 
remember. Pictures of eighth-graders at Yosemite are a legacy in our family 
album. He has worked to earn service points to be among the top 10 students and 
have first choice of the various hikes and activities. A letter sent home says, 
"The teachers who will not participate regret that they have to take the stand 
they have." 
</P>
<P>
The teachers don't have to take this stand; they are making a conscious choice 
to hold the children ransom. The ones getting hurt in this political power 
struggle are the children who feel used and betrayed by those who say they 
care. 
</P>
<P>
Some teachers are even using class time to air their grievances to the 
children. This is wrong and unprofessional. No matter how real the complaints 
are, the children should not be dragged into the argument. 
</P>
<P>
When the situation is eventually settled, whatever the teachers receive will be 
retroactive. Whatever the children have lost will be gone forever. 
</P>
<P>
With the children being used as pawns, we all lose.

TWO PERCEPTIONS OF ANTI-DRUG RALLY FEATURING BUSH AND GATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I attended the anti-drug rally in Santa Ana and came away with two reactions. 
The first was a feeling of anger -- anger because rally organizers sent the 
hundreds of schoolchildren in attendance a double message. 
</P>
<P>
Preceding all the "Just Say No" speeches was a kind of festival of sex and 
violence: a karate expert showed kids that smashing boards -- and perhaps 
people -- is great fun; an impersonator suggested that killing drug dealers 
would abolish the drug problem; the Rams cheerleaders promoted the sort of 
shallow sexuality that isn't too different from the drugs we rightly fear. 
</P>
<P>
But I also left the rally feeling great sadness. Although alcohol is our 
nation's No. 1 drug of choice, no one in the entire program -- from the karate 
expert to President Bush himself -- told the kids that alcohol may hold for 
them precisely the same sort of pain we associate with harder drugs. Nor did 
anyone go beyond platitudes. Telling our children to "Just Say No" is not the 
place to begin a substance abuse program. Drug addiction begins in the home. 
Addiction is a family problem, and all members of the family play some role in 
the addiction process. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that the Committee for a Drug Free Orange County will consider deploying 
some of the vast amounts of money it spends on the Just Say No campaign in the 
pursuit of real drug education -- educating people to recognize addiction, and 
promoting a plan for recovery. But an effective drug education program ought to 
be based firmly on experience. The committee would do well to bring on board 
people who understand addition and recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Here's hoping we'll see a new campaign -- one that recognizes drug and alcohol 
addiction as a family disease, one that moves beyond the comfortable 
simplicities of Just Say No. Let's put the emphasis on recognizing addiction -- 
in all its manifestations -- and promoting recovery.

WALL STREET: AFTER A YEAR, TIME-WARNER DEAL READS LIKE BAD SCRIPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was one year ago this week that Time Inc. and Warner Communications 
announced plans to merge. It was supposed to be a simple transaction: The two 
companies would exchange stock, and, once combined, they'd be mighty enough to 
take on foreign entertainment giants. 
</P>
<P>
"Mind-boggling" was the phrase most often used then to describe the potential 
of the new company. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, that transaction looks anything but simple. And a lot of folks 
on Wall Street, and shareholders of Time in particular, are describing its 
combination with Warner as mindless rather than mind-boggling. In fact, from a 
shareholder point of view, the combination of Time and Warner could go down in 
history as one of the worst deals ever. 
</P>
<P>
The new company, called Time Warner Inc., is struggling against a number of 
unexpected obstacles in the raucous cable-TV business. And it's also being hurt 
by a weakening economy that has been cutting advertising revenue at Time's 
legendary magazine empire. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest problem is the sudden aversion that America has to companies 
that are deeply in debt. And Time Warner has plenty. 
</P>
<P>
Time and Warner never completed their simple stock-for-stock merger 
transaction. You might recall that Paramount Communications, a rival to Warner 
in the entertainment business, upset that plan by offering to acquire Time for 
$10.7 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Time and Warner had their hearts set on their arranged marriage, so Time turned 
Paramount down flat. 
</P>
<P>
It took a couple of months of intense fighting in and out of the courts, but 
eventually Time and Warner came up with a plan. Time would purchase Warner and 
in the process would take on about $9 billion in new debt. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the newly formulated merger looked like an ingenious solution. 
Sure, Time shareholders wouldn't get the $200 a share that Paramount was 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
But they'd get a stake in a company that, once Time Warner got going, could set 
the entertainment world on fire. And besides, people associated with the 
combination were whispering to Wall Street and to the press, Time Warner's 
stock would probably sell for a very respectable $130 a share right from the 
start. 
</P>
<P>
These proponents of the deal were correct -- for a while. Time Warner's stock 
peaked at about $145 shortly after the deal was completed late last year. 
</P>
<P>
But its price last week was just $99, and even that was a $10-a-share 
improvement over what the stock had sold for earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it would get this low," said Edward Atorino, an analyst with 
Salomon Bros. "Strategically, it's a sound concept. However, from a short-term 
perspective, it's a significant disappointment for the shareholder." 
</P>
<P>
"Significant disappointment" is right. In fact, arbitragers on Wall Street 
still contend that Time's decision not to negotiate with Paramount may have 
been the biggest blunder in the history of the takeover business. They say 
without much prodding, Paramount probably would have raised its bid by $25 a 
share to $225. 
</P>
<P>
And, the arbs claim, it will be a long time before the stock of the new Time 
Warner ever reaches that lofty level. 
</P>
<P>
A significant rise in the price of the stock will be particularly difficult 
because of losses that the company will likely report for several years. In the 
fourth quarter of 1989 alone, the company had a deficit of $222 million. The 
loss was almost entirely because of interest owed on the money borrowed to buy 
Warner. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have them in the black until 1993," said James Goss, an analyst at 
Duff &amp; Phelps. 
</P>
<P>
The losses were expected. Before completion of the merger, Time Warner's 
boosters were telling people to ignore the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they were saying, look at the company's wonderful cash flow. The new 
company's properties -- which include major magazines such as Time, People, 
Money and Sports Illustrated; its cable television system, with more than 5.5 
million subscribers, and its film, record and publishing operations -- would 
add up to a media marvel that could generate a wonderful pile of cash. 
</P>
<P>
But even before Time finished buying Warner, Wall Street started to have a 
change of heart about cash flow as the basis for an acquisition. As corporate 
earnings in general started to deteriorate last fall, investors again began 
looking at a company's profits. And Time Warner didn't have any. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Hackel, head of Cash Flow Investors and the guru of that type of 
investing, said the problem isn't that Wall Street doesn't understand Time 
Warner's ability to generate cash. Hackel believes that Wall Street understands 
all too well that Time Warner doesn't have any spare -- or free -- cash flow 
after it pays its bills. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a big difference between cash flow and free cash flow," contended 
Hackel. "At the current rate of free cash flow, it would take 50 years to pay 
off debt." 
</P>
<P>
Hackel believes that Time Warner's stock is worth only $70 to $75 on the basis 
of its free -- or discretionary -- cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
"It's right back to square one," said Salomon's Atorino. 
</P>
<P>
Time's shareholders would probably be more than happy to get back to the 
starting point; right before the Warner merger was announced, the company's 
stock was worth more than $109 a share. 
</P>
<P>
But cash flow isn't the only thing bothering Time Warner followers on Wall 
Street. A move in Washington to reregulate cable television has depressed all 
cable-TV stocks, which were also rocked a few weeks ago by the announcement 
that NBC, News Corp., Cablevision and the Hughes division of General Motors are 
developing a direct broadcast system to compete with cable television. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot has changed in the last six months," said J. Kendrick Noble of Paine 
Webber. But "long term, we haven't changed our mind. We think (Time Warner) is 
a good deal." 
</P>
<P>
Added longtime entertainment industry watcher John Reidy, "I continue to 
believe that if (Time Warner) produces the cash flow, this stock should be in 
the $140 to $150 range within a year." 
</P>
<P>
On the first anniversary of the Time Warner deal, however, Noble and Reidy seem 
to be in the minority with their optimism. The vast majority of Time's original 
shareholders won't be celebrating. They'll just be thinking of that $200 a 
share they didn't get. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speaking Volumes -- Without a Conclusion 
</P>
<P>
Keep an eye on trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange and you'll know 
what stock prices will do. 
</P>
<P>
That's the advice a lot of old-timers on Wall Street give. One old saying is 
that you can't have a bull market unless volume rises. Without the herd, 
there's no bull. Another favorite is that the best indication of a bear market 
is a pickup in trading volume as prices are declining. 
</P>
<P>
When you apply both maxims to recent trading patterns, you could conclude that 
the stock market is going neither higher, nor lower, with any great conviction. 
It can't be a bull market, the old-timers say, because there isn't enough 
volume. And it can't be a bear market because there wasn't enough volume when 
prices were falling in January and February. 
</P>
<P>
It may be time to get rid of old sayings, or at least modernize them. 
</P>
<P>
Daily trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange averaged 155.9 million 
shares last month, down from 172.5 million in January. Trading in January and 
February was only moderately active -- no cause for alarm for either the bulls 
or the bears. 
</P>
<P>
But some experts think that market watchers should shift their focus from New 
York to Chicago, where stock index futures contracts have traded with a 
vengeance since the start of 1990. Traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 
say, for example, that they've been much busier than their brethren on the 
NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics seem to bear that out. More than 1.1 million Standard &amp; 
Poor's 500-stock index futures contracts were trading on the Merc in January. 
That was up sharply from December's 811,000 contracts and much higher than the 
862,000 contracts traded in January, 1989. On the NYSE, meanwhile, trading 
volume in stocks was more or less comparable to that of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody is quite sure what effect an acceleration in trading volume in stock 
index futures contracts will have on the market as a whole. And people are even 
less certain about the correlation between increased trading in the stock index 
contracts and the prospects for a bull or bear market. 
</P>
<P>
But here is a theory. 
</P>
<P>
"If you believe the two markets are linked and one market is showing greater 
volume, and it's going in one direction, it's going to pull the other market," 
said a top trader for one investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the increased trading volume in stock index futures contracts 
in January and February, when prices were declining, could have been the signal 
that Wall Street has a bear on its hands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Much Witchcraft on Expiration Days 
</P>
<P>
In what may come as a big surprise to even the casual observer of the stock 
market's "triple witching hours," a study by two university professors that was 
supported by a grant from the American Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board 
Options Exchange concludes that trading volatility on options expiration days 
is "much ado about (nearly) nothing." 
</P>
<P>
The study, which was recently released by Hans Stoll, a finance professor at 
Vanderbilt University, and Robert E. Whaley, who holds a similar post at Duke 
University, says the effects of index options and index futures on expiration 
days is "quite small." 
</P>
<P>
"It's small in the sense that it's not very different from the price effects 
you have on any given stock on any given day," Stoll said. He admits that there 
have been occasional times -- especially during the "triple witching" days when 
stock index options, index futures and regular stock options expire all at once 
-- that price volatility has been large. 
</P>
<P>
"But even on the quarterly expirations, the average fluctuation is not very 
large and has declined in recent periods," Stoll said. When only index options 
and regular stock options expire on the third Friday of each month, the effect 
on stock prices has always been small, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Remember that on March 16, the next time that stock index options, index 
futures and regular stock options expire simultaneously.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: WHERE TO HIDE WHEN BEARS ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. GARY SHILLING, A. GARY SHILLING is president of A. Gary Shilling &amp; 
Co., economic consultants and portfolio strategists in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stock prices have been dropping since the beginning of the year, and it more 
and more looks like a genuine bear market of some duration. The Dow Jones 
industrial index went to new highs Jan. 2, but the broader Standard &amp; 
Poor's 500 index never got past its October peak and the even broader market 
never got close. Since then, all indexes have fallen and the S&amp;P 500 is 
down 10%. Most Wall Street wizards now tell you that the correction they didn't 
foresee is about over. Beware! It sounds like the same complacency that ruled 
just before the 1987 crash. 
</P>
<P>
Investors concentrated last year on a relatively few takeover stocks. That told 
me that shareholders were suspicious over the health of the basic economy that 
the broad market mirrors. Indeed, the leveraged buyouts were about the only 
source of support for stocks in 1989. It certainly wasn't corporate earnings. 
Economic operating profits fell 20% during the four quarters of last year. In 
the final quarter alone, 53% of a widely followed list of companies reported 
earning below analysts' forecasts, and those disappointments averaged a 
whopping 49% below Wall Street estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices normally respond to earnings and, in the postwar period, have 
consistently dropped when bottom lines fell at the end of business expansions. 
But last year, the S&amp;P 500 rose 32% instead because of three forms of LBO 
support. First, takeover stocks were bought out at highly inflated prices. 
Second, the stock prices of rumored and hoped-for takeover candidates were bid 
up as well. Remember how a whole flock of airline stocks soared after the UAL 
buyout was announced? 
</P>
<P>
Third, many companies increased their dividends enormously last year to push up 
their stock prices. This discouraged hostile takeovers by making it more 
expensive for raiders to buy those stocks. S&amp;P 500 dividends per share rose 
136% in 1989, an extraordinary hike in the face of the steep earnings drop. In 
fact, the dividend payout ratio, which normally falls in the waning days of a 
business expansion as corporate boards get cautious, soared from 36% in the 
third quarter of 1988 to 56% in the fourth quarter of 1989. (That ratio 
measures the percentage of corporate earnings paid out in dividends.) 
</P>
<P>
Sure, some stocks of big companies that were not big takeover targets did well 
last year as investors headed for the safe haven of food, beverage, drug, 
telephone company and other stocks that offer stability and predictability in a 
recessionary climate. But in the main, it was an LBO-dominated stock market. 
Smaller company stocks that were not subject to takeover activity did poorly. 
The Value Line composite, which gives equal weight to medium and small firms, 
rose only 11% in 1989. An equally weighted index of 6,000 stocks, most of them 
small, gained a minuscule 5%, with 45% falling in price. 
</P>
<P>
With the disintegration of junk bonds in the past six months, however, the 
likelihood of new LBOs financed by them is remote, to put it mildly. The demise 
of Drexel Burnham Lambert was only the final nail in their coffin. So, no more 
high takeover bids for stocks, hostile or otherwise. And, without the weapon of 
junk bonds, the raiders are impotent. 
</P>
<P>
Coupling this fact with deteriorating earnings, corporations will cut 
dividends, not raise them, this year. It's easy to see a give-back of last 
year's 32% increase in the S&amp;P 500, especially since that index contains 
many companies that were part of the takeover whirl. It's also easy to envision 
a further big drop in stock prices as investors shift their attention to the 
disappointing and relentless earnings decline. A revisiting of the 1987 crash 
lows -- about a 50% total drop in prices -- is a distinct possibility, 
especially if I'm right that the recession will be global and deep. 
</P>
<P>
How do you invest in this climate? Despite the rise in interest rates in 
January, high-quality interest-sensitive securities are still the best place to 
be, for my money. Rely on Treasury bonds, municipal obligations rated AA or 
better and high-quality utility stocks. These will provide great locations from 
which to watch the recessionary action on the investment field. The weaker the 
economy, the more you'll make in these instruments. 
</P>
<P>
And, the less you'll lose by not being in cyclic stocks. Bail out of those you 
still own now, even at depressed prices. Dump LBOs, actual or rumored, and junk 
bonds (I hope you don't own any). Sure, there's a difference between "good 
junk" and "bad junk," but until the recession really gets rolling and dries up 
cash flow, it's too early to tell a sheep from a goat. Even RJR Nabisco's junk 
is at risk. Besides, all junk bonds, good or bad, may be under pressure for 
some time. Sell commodities and other tangible assets. Avoid Japanese stocks; 
that market is destined for a further big fall. Get ready to buy growth stocks, 
but later at cheaper prices. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, don't look for the stock market slump to be another 1987 crash -- a 
nose dive that is breathtaking, but ends quickly. Nature is seldom 
accommodative enough to let you fight the last war all over again. Instead, 
anticipate a Chinese water torture market that features relentless, 
frustrating, boring declines with a few temporary rallies to break the 
monotony. We haven't had one since 1973, so long ago that few investors and 
even fewer stockbrokers know what it's like. Brace yourself for a miserable 
stock market, but do so against a solid wall of high-quality bonds.

ZAN THOMPSON: WATCHING A STAR AT TENNIS TOURNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The seasoned tournament-goers wore straw hats. I sat there and let the desert 
sun beat on me like a Chinese gong. My friend Jean Erck, who feels that I need 
my horizons widened, had asked me to go to the Virginia Slims Indian Wells 
tennis matches with her. I did and had an interesting afternoon watching the 
tennis players return balls that I didn't even see. 
</P>
<P>
Jean comes from a tennis family. Her husband, Marty, played, she plays, and she 
has two sons who are standouts. Marty Jr. is ranked No. 14 in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
In tennis, there is the same high premium on style as there is in golf. I have 
followed golf players around Riviera Country Club at the Los Angeles Open ever 
since I could walk. You are supposed only to breathe, and that very shallowly, 
so you don't break the concentration of the players. 
</P>
<P>
Same thing at the tennis tournament. The entire stadium sat in seemly silence 
except for an occasional spatter of applause when a player made an impossible 
shot, or a mass intake of breath at a missed shot. 
</P>
<P>
For my first tennis tournament, I was lucky enough to see Martina Navratilova. 
She has won in the regal center court at Wimbledon eight times, and is 
determined to make it nine. She has won three Virginia Slims tournaments this 
year. Nine wins at Wimbledon would make tennis history. We saw her play Helena 
Sukova and win. 
</P>
<P>
The referees stand or sit in little square boxes and yell one-word 
announcements like "Fault," "Ball," and a number of other things. I nodded 
wisely at each call, although most of the calls sounded as if the caller had 
been unexpectedly pinched. The crowd was with Martina so, of course, I did 
exactly what everyone else did, clap and sigh. But I was just a beat behind 
everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
A confection for the spectators in the midst of all that heavy-duty play was a 
doubles match, Billie Jean King on one side with Sonny Bono and recently 
retired Chris Evert with Danny Sullivan, an Indianapolis race driver, on the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
The four players were miked, so the crowd could hear their remarks, and the 
japes they tossed at each other. Bono did well, considering that he was playing 
with two of the world's former women champions. So did Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the Navratilova-Sukova match, Martina was given a check by the 
Kraft-General Foods World Tennis Tour. 
</P>
<P>
When she received the check, she said Andrea Jaeger, a fine player in the '80s 
who had dropped out because of injuries, had set up a foundation to help very 
young players financially. She is calling it Kid Stuff. Martina was giving the 
check to Kid Stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Martina said: "She is following in the footsteps of Billie Jean King, who 
established a tennis foundation for kids." Martina, too, has a foundation for 
young players. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-time Wimbledon winner has a number of dogs. The lucky pooch who 
travels with her is a toy fox terrier named K.D. The rest of the pack stays 
home in Aspen. The small dog was sitting in the lap of a friend of 
Navratilova's. K.D. seemed to know a good deal more about tennis than I did.

THE PERILS OF VOICING ONE'S OWN OPINIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Is Saying What You Think Too Perilous?" (Feb. 27): 
</P>
<P>
Yes, saying what you think is often too perilous, if you're talking about race 
or ethnicity or sexual life style in this country, particularly if you make 
this mistake in the mass media. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Wolfe has become infamous in liberal circles for openly writing about the 
racial-ethnic conflicts that everybody knows hide just beneath the veneer of 
our approved national self-image. 
</P>
<P>
So we end up with a fairy tale world, in fiction or journalism, with the media 
officially promoting all the proper attitudes and ignoring the fact that many 
class, ethnic and sexual life style differences are true differences that can 
and often do promote conflict, dysfunction and disease. 
</P>
<P>
All sorts of scientific studies show that overpopulation and congestion in 
themselves cause anger and violence, not only in humans, but in animals as 
well. A serious discussion of these issues requires rocking the boat, speaking 
out on matters of birth control, religion, ethnicity, social class, 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, like any sick family, is sick because of the secrets it 
keeps; secrets too fearful to be faced if we insist on maintaining a nicey-nice 
fiction about ourselves.

WHAT SIMON SAYS ABOUT RAPE HITS TARGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I commend you on Roger Simon's "Rape: Clothing Is Not the Criminal" (Feb. 18). 
People repeatedly assume that women "ask for" the sexual abuse inflicted upon 
them, and this is of course not so. Simon displayed, very clearly, that the 
violent act comes from the attacker.

RADICALLY DIFFERENT OPINIONS OF ACTIVIST'S 'JOURNEY OF CONSCIENCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The story on Westside political radical Mary Brent Wehrli filled me with anger 
and pity ("A Westside Journey of Conscience," Feb. 26). The anger stems from 
the apparent sense of satisfaction Wehrli derived from heckling the President 
of the United States during his delivery of a speech. 
</P>
<P>
A 47-year-old woman should know better than to conduct herself in such a 
reckless, immature manner. 
</P>
<P>
If Wehrli is so upset with the foreign policy of the Bush Administration, she 
has several more respectable outlets by which to express her dissatisfaction, 
such as running for office, financially supporting candidates who reflect her 
views, or participating in organized political rallies that do not include 
hurling unfounded accusations at the President. 
</P>
<P>
My pity stems from Wehrli's seeming inability to even remotely realize that 
what she did Feb. 6 at the Century Plaza was an outrageous breach of good 
manners, and that she would have no reservations in attempting to embarrass the 
President -- and herself and family -- again. Wehrli's headlong plummet into 
radical, nonsensical politics has dealt a fatal blow to her perspective and 
good judgment.

CHEERS: Partisan supporters of the Spotlight Awards at the Music Center were 
anything but reserved. Not only did Doc Severinsen and his "Tonight Show" band 
raise decibels, but the youthful audience unabashedly cheered favorite 
competitors. The Spotlight Awards, presented through a grant from Pacific 
Telesis, honor Southern California's finest young performers. 
</P>

Actor Gregory Harrison kept a cute commentary going as awards went to singer 
Lynette Tapia, pianists Anders Martinson and Wendy Chen, violinist Michelle 
Kim, dancer Arthur Leroy Sabb and the drama teams of Jeff DiFranco and Angela 
Randall Hoover and Chris DuVal and Jeremy Johnson. Winners received $40,000 in 
scholarships, then attended the gala dinner in the Grand Hall planned by Peggy 
Parker, Fred Roberts and Joni Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Joni Smith had special toasts for Spotlight's executive producers, Walter E. 
Grauman and Peggy Parker, now Mr. and Mrs. The couple, Smith noted, were 
married by Judge Matt Byrne "somewhere between revising the program and doing 
the seating for this party -- between 11:15 a.m. and 2 p.m."

ROGER SIMON: JACKSON BOWS OUT, BUT HE NEVER BOWED IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jesse Jackson walked slowly into the church basement accompanied by 57 
ministers and community leaders. They arrayed themselves around him in two long 
lines as Jackson delivered his consent decree. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson had called this little gathering to announce that although he had never 
said he was going to run for mayor of Washington, he would stop running for 
mayor in the future. Though not many residents of Washington shed any tears 
over this announcement, there was a great gnashing of teeth in the media. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly a year, commentator after commentator had urged Jackson to run. They 
had their reasons ready: 
</P>
<P>
* It would get Jackson out of the 1992 Democratic presidential race and thereby 
help heal the party. (Which Jackson cared nothing about.) 
</P>
<P>
* It would help Jackson by proving he could win elective office. (Though his 
lack of elective experience, Jackson recognizes, is often an excuse people use 
to disguise far uglier reasons for not wanting him in the White House.) 
</P>
<P>
* It would save Jackson the embarrassment of another loss in 1992. (Though 
Jackson happens to believe he might win the nomination in 1992 or at least get 
the vice presidential spot.) 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, Jackson pulled out. He did so only a few weeks after a 
different kind of article began circulating in the press: These showed that 
although the national media might think it just swell to have Jackson as mayor, 
Washington residents did not. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Washington? Oh, yeah, them. Seems a lot of people forgot about 
them. But they had something to say. And it was that, while they viewed Jackson 
as a national figure and an inspirational figure and even an historic figure, 
they didn't think he cared much about filling potholes. Or towing abandoned 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
So Jackson bowed out without ever having officially bowed in. And I thought he 
looked relieved when he did it. He no longer had to worry about actually 
running a city. Instead, he could do what he liked to do best: He could 
champion a cause, launch a crusade. 
</P>
<P>
His becoming mayor of Washington would never have made history. (Which was one 
of the six reasons that I listed a year ago why Jackson would never run for 
mayor.) But making Washington the 51st state, now that would be historic. Which 
is what Jackson now wants. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson announced it would be a titanic struggle, a struggle worthy of him. He 
compared it to no less a battle than those faced by blacks in South Africa. 
"Just as Mandela is out of jail, but not free," Jackson said, "by democratic 
standards, the citizens of Washington are out of jail, but not free." 
</P>
<P>
Then Jackson hinted at "direct action" to achieve statehood, saying that 
"marching" and "going to jail" might be necessary to "free" the District of 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
And because all battles must have a first shot, Jackson fired his at a 
slow-moving target: Gov. William Donald Schaefer of Maryland. The day before, 
Schaefer, in response to a question, had said that, if "their statehood is not 
feasible," he would "have no problem with D.C. becoming a part of Maryland." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer figured the district might actually want it. After all, this would 
give Jackson what he said he wanted: representation for the people. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson went ballistic when I asked him about Schaefer's statement. 
"Washington, D.C., has its distinction and its tradition," Jackson said. "And 
really what he's proposing is a kind of Bantustan concept. And as we end 
Bantustans in South Africa, we're not going to transfer them to Washington." 
</P>
<P>
Bantustans are the phony black "homelands" created by the government of South 
Africa, where blacks would be allowed to live in poverty and without any civil 
rights. To accuse Schaefer of wanting this for Washington was a considerable 
insult. 
</P>
<P>
But, actually, there was a certain logic to Schaefer's position: Maryland had 
given up the land that now forms Washington. George Washington himself 
bamboozled Maryland property owners out of their land in 1790 for $66 an acre. 
(George must have had a silver tongue to go along with those wooden teeth.) 
</P>
<P>
So if statehood does not get approved by Congress (and I don't know anybody who 
believes it will), wouldn't rejoining Maryland give the district the senators 
and governor and voting representatives it says it wants? 
</P>
<P>
But in suggesting this, Schaefer accidentally pulled back the curtain on the 
dirty little secret of statehood. It is not, as Jackson and others claim, about 
representation for the citizens of the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
It is about representation for the district that the power brokers behind it 
personally desire. If the issue were merely about representation in Congress, 
then supporters would be glad to get Maryland's senators representing them. 
</P>
<P>
But the supporters of statehood have different plans. They want to pick their 
own senators -- and one may be named Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
I am not saying this is wrong. But let's not dress up the question of statehood 
with Revolutionary War phrases like taxation without representation or even 
compare it to the genuine struggle for human and civil rights in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Statehood is not about freedom for the people. It is about jobs for the few.

SELF-STARTERS WILL GET A JUMP ON SUCCESS FROM LOW-INCOME LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

PASADENA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No fancy signs or newspaper advertisements tell passers-by that inside the 
weathered two-story building on Painter Street is a businesswoman with a big 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
Henrietta Samuels, 49, a seamstress, lives on the top floor in a cramped 
one-bedroom apartment she shares with her husband and two sons. Her workplace 
is a small bedroom table, where she sits day and night in front of a secondhand 
Singer. 
</P>
<P>
She is one of many low-income residents in Pasadena and Altadena running 
"microenterprises" -- everything from organically grown herb shops to 
child-care services to leather goods boutiques -- out of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Under a Pasadena-based pilot program, Samuels and 18 other self-starters soon 
will have a chance to turn their microenterprises into something bigger. They 
will be eligible for small loans allowing them to buy inventory and raw 
materials, and to replace antiquated equipment. The nonprofit Neighborhood 
Enterprise Center program also is creating networks in which entrepreneurs 
share advice for avoiding common pitfalls in operating a new business. 
</P>
<P>
Before she left her native Jamaica in 1980, Samuels already was sewing for a 
living. She sold hand-tailored dresses and did alterations. 
</P>
<P>
But after a decade of self-employment, the loan program marks Samuels' first 
chance to borrow the $1,000 she needs for a new sewing machine. 
</P>
<P>
"My desire, my biggest desire, is to go professional," she said on a recent 
afternoon, inspecting the hem of a long-sleeved fuchsia and turquoise dress. 
"That's why I came here, because I wanted to do designing." 
</P>
<P>
Founders of the Neighborhood Enterprise Center say the three-year program will 
draw its participants from distressed neighborhoods in northwest Pasadena and 
Altadena, where home-based businesses are seen as viable alternatives to 
minimum wage jobs -- but require starting capital. 
</P>
<P>
Family Savings and Loan Assn. in Pasadena has agreed to provide low-interest 
loans ranging from $500 to $2,500, which will be distributed in a "peer group 
lending system." Under the system, participants are placed in groups of three 
to seven people. In each group, loans are doled out one at a time, and each 
recipient must pay back the loan before the next person receives any money. 
</P>
<P>
The center, one of four nationwide, eventually will assist 50 entrepreneurs, 
mostly women and minority heads of households, over the three-year period, said 
Anita Jackson, the program's development coordinator. Programs are already 
under way in Philadelphia, Jackson, Miss., and the Rosebud Indian Reservation 
in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
In northwest Pasadena, a largely minority community, there is a thriving crop 
of home-based businesses, according to a study by the Washington-based 
Neighborhood Reinvestment Corp., a public, nonprofit group that is contributing 
$30,000 to the project. But many residents don't have access to bank loans 
through formal channels because they lack the necessary collateral and business 
experience, the study says. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of people who make an effort and do not succeed based on 
their financial status," said Jackson. "They simply do not have enough to 
operate a business successfully." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corp. study, the median household 
income in northwest Pasadena is $22,000, 25% less than the median income 
citywide, and unemployment is 8%, 60% higher than the rest of Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those chosen to participate in the program run their businesses to 
supplement outside income. Norma Passarella and her daughter, Lorenza, for 
example, make children's clothes and costumes and upholster furniture in their 
Pasadena homes while running a housecleaning business together. 
</P>
<P>
They said they could use the loan to expand their operations. "What we can do 
is try and hire a couple of girls to go and do part of the work," said Lorenza 
Passarella, 27. 
</P>
<P>
Others work at home full time. Irene Duncan, 38, of Altadena, said she's had 
her share of dead-end jobs, and she has now turned her full attention to making 
leather goods -- purses, wallets and trendy black hats patterned after those 
worn by rap performers. She said she would use the money to buy more leather. 
</P>
<P>
"I watch the youngsters. Whatever they wear, that's what I make," Duncan said. 
"They wouldn't find these in the stores. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent two years at Kent State toward my nursing degree, but I discovered 
sewing was inside of me. . . . I know I'm a designer because I'm always coming 
up with new ideas. Some days I can make $200; some days I can make $400. Some 
days I might make $15. But to me it's better than being tied down to $40 a 
day."

ANTI-DRUG AD TO GET NATIONAL PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plastic bag tumbles to the ground, expelling puffs of white powder as it 
lands. A voice intones: "This bag costs $12,000 on the street." 
</P>
<P>
The scene changes to a black body bag as it is zipped up and slid into a morgue 
locker by a bespectacled man in a lab coat. "This bag costs $4.25," purrs the 
voice. "Not a very good return on your investment, is it?" 
</P>
<P>
In 15 seconds, the public service announcement, conceived by teen-agers David 
Horvath and Richard Lee, punches harder than "Just say no." As the 1989 winner 
in a nationwide student competition sponsored by the Scott Newman Center, the 
commercial, titled simply "Cocaine," will be distributed to big city television 
stations next month for airing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very powerful and yet very simple," said Karen Reist, who, as the Newman 
center's PSA Project director, runs the student contest. The anti-drug center 
in Hollywood was formed after actor Paul Newman's son died in 1978 at 28 of a 
drug and alcohol overdose. 
</P>
<P>
Horvath's and Lee's message was chosen from about 1,100 entries. The youths 
designed the commercial last year when both were students at University High 
School in West Los Angeles. Horvath, 18, now attends Santa Monica College, and 
Lee, 17, has since moved and is a senior at Temple City High School in the San 
Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Art teacher Fran Nichols, knowing Horvath was interested in an advertising 
career, suggested the Scott Newman contest, which called for story boards for 
public service announcements (known as PSAs in the ad business) with an 
anti-drug point. The rules required partners, so Horvath asked Lee, a friend 
and fellow art student, to collaborate. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two months, meeting in their daily art class, the boys swapped 
ideas. It was a process notable for its harmony. "(We) never had a 
disagreement. . . ." Lee said. "Because," Horvath chimed in, "whenever (an 
idea) wasn't liked by one, it wasn't liked by both." 
</P>
<P>
Some of their approaches they rejected as too gory for public consumption or 
too weak -- such as images of a young addict dying or gang members dying. "It's 
more effective if you can show what can happen, but not showing it happening," 
Horvath said. 
</P>
<P>
The students chose cocaine because it's lethal and widely used, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Horvath came up with the two-bag concept, while thinking of "things that are 
named the same thing, but (are) different." 
</P>
<P>
Their prize came one day last December: A 6:30 a.m. limousine ride from their 
homes on the Westside to a studio in Valencia, where they spent the day posing 
for photos with the producer and director and watching their idea getting 
transferred to videotape by professionals. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles police officer at the filming made sure the bag of baking powder 
looked like credible cocaine and priced the bag accordingly, Horvath said. The 
bag was dropped about 100 times in the quest for the perfect drop. 
</P>
<P>
The message, Lee said, has no targeted age or demographic group. "We basically 
aimed at everyone. Any person that watches this, we want to affect them." 
</P>
<P>
The Horvath and Lee PSA partnership started as a friendship fueled by common 
enthusiasm for art and specifically for Frank Miller, a comic-book artist known 
for "The Dark Knight Returns." Miller stands out from the other "monotonous" 
comic book art that all "seems like the same guy's doing it," Horvath said. 
</P>
<P>
The duo is creating a comic book set in the future in which the 32nd Amendment 
to the U.S. Constitution outlaws gambling. The main character, Detective 
Harrison Keplan, becomes obsessed with avenging the death of his partner, 
murdered when he came too close to uncovering the casino operations of an 
"underground Mafia dude," said Lee, who wrote most of the plot. There's plenty 
of action and gun battles and blood along the way. 
</P>
<P>
If the book is published, Lee says, they'll develop stories with flashbacks to 
Keplan's better days, when his partner was alive. 
</P>
<P>
Lee adds that, after having "so much fun being creative with David" for the PSA 
contest, he, too, wants to go into advertising. He is taking a film class at 
school and an advertising class at the Art Center College of Design in 
Pasadena. Horvath plans to take classes at the Art Center this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the theme of their first foray into advertising, the two don't consider 
themselves anti-drug zealots. They said they don't personally know anyone who 
has died of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
But Horvath added that he has a former close friend who "smokes pot every 
single day. . . . Whenever I would go up to talk to him, all he talks about is 
what great stuff he's got. . . . That just doesn't appeal to me."

The Pasadena Unified School District board moved closer to picking a new 
district superintendent Thursday when it whittled down its list of internal 
applicants from four to one, board President Anne Pursel said. 
</P>
<P>
Pursel declined to name the remaining candidate, saying the board wants to have 
further discussions with the candidate before making any contract decision. 
</P>
<P>
But at least one board member has said Joseph Linscomb, Pasadena's deputy 
superintendent for instruction who is serving as acting superintendent, is a 
likely candidate for the job. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the board is expected to decide whether to make the candidate an 
offer or expand its search to a state or national level. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Elbie Hickambottom, who has criticized the board's decision to 
look at internal candidates first, said at Thursday's meeting that he still 
favors expanding the search to a state or national level, Pursel said. 
</P>
<P>
The district is seeking a replacement for Phillip Jordan, who retired from the 
$91,000-a-year post last year. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Pasadena Unified also lost one of its two assistant 
superintendents. Robert Sampieri left to take the No. 2 job in the Chicago 
Unified School District.

TINY TASK CAPTIVATES THERAPISTS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICAL: PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ARE WORKING TO TONE THE MUSCLES OF PREMATURE 
INFANTS TO HELP PREVENT DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEMS LATER.

James sucks on a glove. That's a good sign. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraging James' tongue and jaw muscles to suck on a gloved hand is part of 
the treatment from his therapist. He needs a therapist, not as the victim of an 
accident or stroke, but as a baby born 11 weeks too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything we're doing is preventive," said Penny Erickson, James Zazueta's 
occupational therapist at Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Occupational and physical therapists guide adult patients back into normal 
lives, but as medical advances save younger and sicker babies, specialists' 
attention has expanded to include infants too sick to move or born so 
prematurely they did not fully develop their muscle and nerve systems in the 
womb. 
</P>
<P>
"Their muscle tone tends to be weak, hurting their ability to roll over and sit 
up," Erickson said of her tiny charges. "If they don't develop muscle tone, 
they may later have problems with writing and fine-muscle tasks." 
</P>
<P>
Abnormal muscle tone is the major non-medical developmental problem for babies. 
At a stage when hands and mouths are their main means of exploring the world, 
infants' neuromuscular development is vital for a normal rate of growth. 
</P>
<P>
James, having lost maturation time in his mother's womb, was born unable to 
suck, bend his knees or grasp with his fingers, all normal tasks for a 
full-term infant. 
</P>
<P>
In the womb, infants first develop the ability to extend their muscles. Later, 
the increasingly cramped quarters of the uterus in the last few weeks of 
gestation forces them to flex their muscles and limbs toward the front of their 
bodies. Premature infants who are unable to flex their muscles are born with 
their necks and spines extended back. Without the strength to lift them against 
the force of gravity, their arms and legs lie flat, instead of curling up and 
flailing about as do those of full-term infants. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens to them is absolutely the antithesis of what you would like to 
happen to them," said Erin Keane-Porter, an occupational therapist at AMI 
Medical Center of Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
Preemies and sick infants are evaluated to determine where the occupational or 
physical therapy is needed. Some are stroked -- almost like the adult version 
of a massage -- for about 20 minutes each day. The soothing, stroking motions 
may be repeated on their arms so that they can be helped to move their thumbs 
up to be sucked, one of the ways that babies comfort themselves. Tiny hands 
need stroking by an adult's finger to encourage grasping. Legs might be gently 
flexed. The preemies may be held in positions that facilitate movement of their 
limbs. Rolled blankets may be placed against their backs to encourage curling 
in the fetal position. 
</P>
<P>
The touch and movement stimulates the infant's nerves, which in turn message 
the brain. The activity matures the brain and nervous system, and it helps 
muscles to function properly. As babies use their muscles more, their movements 
become less jerky. Although many preemies do well without this therapy, their 
mental and physical growth may be slower, therapists say. 
</P>
<P>
First used about 15 years ago, the therapy has become more common in hospitals 
partly because technology has saved more premature babies than before. 
</P>
<P>
"Technology has progressed. They're saving more and more infants, younger 
infants and sicker infants," said Ann Hyde, an occupational therapist at 
Glendale Adventist Medical Center. "Those children are at a higher risk with 
development later on." 
</P>
<P>
Not all medical specialists are convinced that skin and muscle stimulation is 
beneficial. Although they are among believers in the treatment, Erickson and 
Hyde said no study has shown conclusively that tactile stimulation works. In 
addition, experts in the field said attributing babies' improvement to such 
therapy alone would be difficult because so many factors have to be considered, 
including the use of machines and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no studies that show it works, but there are no studies to show that 
it doesn't," said Dr. Tom Sherry, director of the neonatal intensive care unit 
at the Kaiser hospital. "There are a lot of things in medicine like that. We'd 
rather do it than find out later we should have. I'm more willing to use it, 
but I'm just as skeptical." 
</P>
<P>
Sherry said some muscletone problems that are resolved by 12 months probably 
would have disappeared without intervention. But he said sick infants, such as 
those with neurological problems, definitely improve with the therapy. 
</P>
<P>
One study by the University of Miami and Duke University medical schools about 
six years ago concluded that babies given the therapy gain weight faster, sleep 
better, are more alert and leave the hospital six days earlier, saving the 
hospital an average of $3,000 per infant. Other studies by medical schools, 
doctors and therapists showed that such stimulation appeared effective, but 
they cautioned that more investigation is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Hyde said the therapy really caught on in the last five years. "I get calls all 
the time from other hospitals saying that the neonatal intensive care unit 
wants training for therapists," she said. In the last year, Hyde received calls 
from about 10 hospitals asking for Glendale's training program, which teaches 
therapists how to evaluate babies' reactions to the stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
At Glendale, gentle stimulation is given to about 98% of the babies in the 
intensive care unit, which admits about 200 sick and premature infants each 
year, Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, some care givers said, early intervention therapy saves 
medical costs, such as charges for surgery or for equipment to rectify 
developmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson stuck her hands inside James' incubator. That morning, at 33 weeks 
since conception, the baby weighed 3 pounds, 2 ounces, almost a pound more than 
at birth four weeks before. A respirator tube was in his mouth and an 
intravenous tube in his foot. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson flexed James' legs, watching to see whether they would recoil, the 
reaction of a full-term infant when its legs are tugged. But although the 
therapist felt the movement of a tiny tendon in James' foot, his legs dropped 
like lifeless objects. 
</P>
<P>
"Real weak, but he's responding much more than two days ago," said Erickson, 
who has helped organize treatment programs at four hospitals since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, James, like many other preemies and sick infants, will probably 
be brought back to therapists for checkups on his balance, motor skills and how 
he solves problems such as fitting together the pieces of a puzzle. 
Developmental problems may take a long time to disappear, and treatment is 
often required into young adulthood, therapists say. 
</P>
<P>
Parents like Pamela Jenkins are taught to continue the therapy after the baby 
goes home. Jenkins, who worked with her daughter at home for a year, was at 
first scared of hurting her baby, who was born with neurological problems. "I 
was scared because my child's muscles were so tight. She cried a lot when I did 
the exercises in the beginning. With her not being able to talk, I didn't know 
whether she was hurting." 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins now believes that the therapy saved her from high expenses for 
corrective and medical treatments and from a life of serving a child who was 
unable to care for her own needs. 
</P>
<P>
"From what the doctors were telling me, I thought I had to dedicate my life in 
taking care of her," Jenkins said. "When she was born, I was told if she lasted 
through the night, that was good. The first time I ever saw her, she was hooked 
up to quite a few machines. Her mouth was taped, and she had a tube going down 
her stomach. She didn't hardly move at all. She was big in size, eight pounds, 
but she was lifeless to me. 
</P>
<P>
"To see her now -- I still look at the pictures of her when she was at the 
hospital -- you would not believe that she was the same child." 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals encourage parents to start working with premature or ill newborns 
when the babies are still in incubators. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents start focusing on the monitors, watching the numbers and not 
looking at what their baby is doing," Erickson said. "We want them to start 
looking at the baby and at how the baby is responding to them. We want to get 
the parents bonded to the babies, handling them, feeding them, changing their 
diapers. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the parents involved are very receptive to doing any kind of exercise 
or handling. A lot of it is just natural."

HEALTH WORKERS HELP EASE OLDER CAMBODIANS OVER CULTURAL BARRIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nem Norn is almost always tired. A refugee from Cambodia, Nem, 53, saw two of 
his children killed by the communist Khmer Rouge before he fled to the United 
States five years ago. Today he shares a small apartment in Long Beach with his 
wife and four surviving children where, suspecting that his constant state of 
exhaustion stems from the longstanding depression of his past, he struggles 
through his days with little help. 
</P>
<P>
Yoth Yoeung, 45, has a lump in her throat. Once she went to a doctor, but the 
doctor could not speak her language. So Yoeung, also a Cambodian refugee, does 
the best she can without much comprehension. "I never understand what the 
doctor says," she explained through an interpreter who recently visited her 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
That interpreter was part of a new program that already has served about 350 
older Southeast Asians in Long Beach, either by luring them to health education 
classes or by providing translators for their appointments with doctors. 
Sponsored by St. Mary Medical Center and United Cambodian Community Inc., its 
aim is to reach Southeast Asians 45 and older, particularly Cambodian refugees, 
whose language barriers, cultural values, fear or general alienation often 
prevent them from seeking or using much-needed medical care. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an uphill battle," said Lillian Lew, project director, "but I'm sure that 
we can make an impact on this community." 
</P>
<P>
In the seven months since the program began, she said, it has sent teams of 
bilingual health workers door-to-door in central-city apartment complexes where 
large numbers of Southeast Asians live. The teams also have been stationed at a 
local Cambodian Buddhist temple, where many older Cambodians spend much of 
their time. 
</P>
<P>
The service is delivered in two basic ways, Lew said. First, health workers 
introduce themselves, distribute leaflets bearing the program's telephone 
number and interview people regarding the general state of their health. And 
second, she said, they organize "health fairs" at the temple or in the 
apartment complexes to provide health education and such basic health-care 
screening as blood pressure checks, diabetes tests and vision exams. 
</P>
<P>
When health problems are discovered, Lew said, project workers make 
appointments for the refugees with doctors of their choice or at St. Mary. If 
necessary, she said, they provide transportation to the doctor's office and may 
act as interpreters during the appointments. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Lew said, she hopes to expand the program into Asian markets, where 
health workers would give lectures on nutrition and provide demonstrations on 
healthful methods of cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Diet is a key reason for the program, according to Lew, a Chinese-American who 
is a registered dietitian with degrees in sociology and cross-cultural 
education. Among other things, she said, Southeast Asian traditions encourage 
the consumption of fatty meats, which contributes to a high incidence of 
strokes and cardiovascular disease; pickled or fermented foods, which doctors 
suspect of causing stomach cancer, and foods high in sodium, which contribute 
to hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Cambodian refugees' general health problems were made worse under 
the regime of Khmer Rouge guerrilla leader Pol Pot, when food was scarce, and 
by life in refugee camps, where conditions were primitive. 
</P>
<P>
Although no data exists on the health status of Southeast Asian refugees, Lew 
said, they seem to suffer from high rates of hepatitis B, perhaps caused by 
unsanitary living conditions; malnutrition, which is probably a result of the 
war years, and diabetes, which may be diet or stress-related. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, many older Cambodians suffer from serious mental health 
problems, resulting both from the trauma of their past experiences and their 
current difficulties in adapting to a new culture. 
</P>
<P>
One of the goals of the new health project, Lew said, is to collect some of the 
missing data on the health needs of older Southeast Asians. The task is 
difficult because they are wary, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Southeast Asians have a different world health view," Lew said. "They have 
their own underground health culture." 
</P>
<P>
One popular perception holds that a hospital is a place where one goes only to 
die. Because medical techniques in that region are an average of 30 years 
behind those in the United States, Lew said, many refugees utilize herbal 
cures, spiritual healing or over-the-counter medicines rather than seek the 
advice of trained physicians. 
</P>
<P>
It was to help provide alternatives to those practices that the FHP Foundation 
-- a Long Beach-based organization dedicated to supporting health-care 
education, research and services -- recently awarded a $140,000 grant to the 
Southeast Asian Health Project, which runs the new program. The money is being 
used, Lew said, for printed materials, health fair personnel and to pay the 
salaries of the teams of bilingual health workers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the refugees encountered during a recent visit to their apartment 
complex seemed to appreciate the personal attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy if someone comes to knock at my door," said Lach Kheng, 57, 
who, speaking through the interpreter, had complained of "hot" feeings inside 
his stomach. "It's a help. I don't know where to go or what to do. At least now 
I can discuss it."

Arizona Wilderness 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 356 to 45, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 2570) setting 
aside 1.1 million Bureau of Land Management acres in Arizona as federal 
wilderness to be permanently protected against degradation. 
</P>
<P>
The measure opens an additional 950,000 BLM acres to uses such as mining and 
grazing. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of a series of bills Congress has taken up in recent years to 
preserve large wilderness areas in most states. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Morris K. Udall (D-Ariz.) said people should have "the strength, the 
courage and the wisdom to leave at least these places as we found them." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bob Stump (R-Ariz.) called the bill "an overzealous effort to protect 
public lands from human intrusion." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the wilderness bill.

Adam Brock doesn't look like a sick child. 
</P>
<P>
He is 10 years old, loves to tackle his younger brothers and shoot baskets out 
front of his Tarzana home. His bedroom is plastered with posters of Bo Jackson, 
Mickey Mantle and John Candy. On his bookshelf are more than a dozen baseball 
and basketball trophies. And a picture of himself with longer hair. 
</P>
<P>
But near his closet are two shelves that look like they belong in a hospital. 
They contain needles, a sterile solution used with intravenous injection 
devices and assorted oral medications. There is an infectious waste container 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
These have become more important to Adam than all his trophies combined. 
</P>
<P>
Adam has leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, his mother loads a tray with needles and solutions and flushes out 
two lines that were surgically implanted in Adam's chest in December. The lines 
make it easier for doctors to draw blood and administer chemotherapy -- as they 
will again starting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors have given Adam one year to find a bone marrow donor. Otherwise, they 
say his disease will be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
"Not too long ago one year would never have been enough time to find a donor," 
said Dr. Rudi Brutoco, a Covina pediatrician who, in September, 1988, started 
an organization called Life-Savers Foundation that recruits marrow donors. 
"Today it is reasonable to think that Adam will find a donor in time." 
</P>
<P>
In less than two years, Life-Savers has organized enough donor drives 
nationwide to increase the number of donors listed with the National Marrow 
Donor Program from 17,000 to nearly 90,000. Brutoco has set a goal of 
increasing the list to 150,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with all the people who have been tested and put into the national bank, 
there are still people who don't have a match available," Brutoco said. "And so 
we must keep working on it." 
</P>
<P>
Life-Savers gained national attention recently for helping Anissa Ayala, 17, a 
Walnut teen-ager who has leukemia. Mary Ayala, the girl's 43-year-old mother, 
conceived a child hoping its bone marrow would match Anissa's and that a 
transplant would save the teen's life. Tests sponsored by Life-Savers showed 
that the unborn baby girl's bone marrow does match Anissa's and when the child 
is 6 months old, a transplant probably will be performed. A search is still 
being conducted for a compatible match for Anissa, and if one is found the 
family would not need to use the baby's marrow. 
</P>
<P>
"Children are the best donors of all," Brutoco said. "People have jumped all 
over this because they thought we were going to use the marrow and throw away 
the baby. That's absolutely ridiculous." The plan to use the baby's marrow has 
been criticized for the ethical dilemma it raises in bringing a child into the 
world to save another. 
</P>
<P>
There is a 25% chance that two siblings will share a common bone marrow type, 
but the odds of matching up with a stranger are 20,000 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
The parents of Adam Brock and Dean Schmitt, a 15-year-old Thousand Oaks boy 
with leukemia, have ruled out the possibility of having another child in the 
hopes of finding a bone marrow match. 
</P>
<P>
"But both of them would do it if they could," Brutoco said. "The fact is, they 
really don't have time. Those boys need donors very quickly because their forms 
of leukemia move much swifter than the kind Anissa has." 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Life-Savers has organized several donor drives for the boys, 
including one for Adam Brock that will take place today from 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 
p.m. at Stratton's Restaurant in Encino. The drive will be held in conjunction 
with a fund-raising brunch that will cost $50 per adult and $15 per child under 
18. Children age 3 and under are free and all proceeds will go to Adam Brock's 
account with Life-Savers. 
</P>
<P>
Blood tests to scan potential donors cost $75 apiece. Although friends and 
family members have raised more than $60,000 for Adam's donor drives, they have 
used all the money and still have not found a donor, according to Laurie Brock, 
the boy's mother. 
</P>
<P>
"It is sometimes difficult to convince people to be tested because they think 
they're giving a lung or a kidney or something," Brutoco said. "It's not like 
that, but it's our job to educate the public." 
</P>
<P>
During a transplant procedure, 5% of a donor's marrow is taken while the donor 
is under a light anesthesia. Normal activity may resume the next day and the 
donor's marrow replenishes itself within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
One problem leukemia patients face is the reluctance of some potential donors 
listed with the national bank. Last week, a Seattle woman scheduled to donate 
marrow to Tarzana attorney Marc Smith, 36, changed her mind about undergoing 
the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"This is always a problem we face," Brutoco said. "People get into the bank 
because they wanted to help a friend or relative and when it turns out that 
they match up with a stranger in another state, they back out." 
</P>
<P>
It was May, 1988, when Brutoco's wife, Diana, was diagnosed with chronic 
myeloid leukemia -- a slow-acting leukemia that is normally fatal within three 
years if a transplant is not performed. Immediately, Diana's brothers were 
tested to see if their marrow matched hers. It did not. And because Diana's 
marrow type was not represented in the National Marrow Donor Program bank, 
doctors told her the disease would likely be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
"So we formed Life-Savers and got together our first donor drive," Brutoco 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Through the couple's efforts, a donor was found and in March, 1989, Diana 
Brutoco received a transplant. Today she has resumed an active lifestyle 
working for the foundation and caring for the couple's four children. Like 
other leukemia transplant patients, Diana has a 70% chance of complete 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still so many people dying needlessly from leukemia because someone 
can't find a donor in time," Brutoco said. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Schmitt had been swimming competitively since he was 5 years old and last 
spring was a valuable member of the Thousand Oaks High School swim team when he 
came down with flu symptoms, said Shirley Schmitt, his mother. When the 
symptoms refused to go away, Schmitt took her son in for tests and doctors 
discovered the leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Today he is home from school and suffers from the side effects of chemotherapy 
-- a bloated face, constant nausea and the loss of his blond hair. 
</P>
<P>
Life-Savers set up a temporary testing laboratory at the Emcon Environmental 
Consultant Firm in Burbank where Dean's father, Ralph, works. More than 150 
employees agreed to be tested and many of them made financial donations matched 
by the firm. 
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to help us save our son," Shirley Schmitt said. "Life-Savers 
has been a big help. We couldn't have done it on our own." 
</P>
<P>
Laurie and Larry Brock feel the same way about the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"They have helped get the word out and they send licensed technicians to the 
donor drives," Laurie Brock said. "Adam doesn't really understand what is going 
on, but he knows that we're all trying to find him a donor." 
</P>
<P>
Adam said he isn't afraid of leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
But he is afraid of getting a transplant. Prior to receiving donated marrow, a 
leukemia patient must take near-lethal doses of chemotherapy to destroy his own 
infected marrow. If the patient is not in remission, he may not be strong 
enough to survive the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember once at the hospital when this boy was getting his transplant and 
all of the sudden everyone started running around," Adam said. "The little 
boy's mother was crying and everyone was trying to calm her down. It looked 
kind of scary so now I'm afraid of the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
"But I know it's what I need." 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Brock remembers the incident. The boy receiving the transplant had not 
been strong enough and had died during the operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I still haven't told Adam," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Adam's house is full of activity these days. Donor drives have brought many 
professional athletes and movie stars out to visit him and offer their best 
wishes. Recently, the Clippers basketball organization took him and his mother 
by limousine for a game at the Sports Arena, where Adam was an honorary ball 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the attention, Adam normally doesn't talk about his disease when 
strangers are around, Laurie Brock said. 
</P>
<P>
But recently, when his mother was talking with a visitor about the boy's 
illness, Adam bounded into the house and flopped down on a nearby chair. 
</P>
<P>
"Mom, I just wanted to ask you how come I got leukemia?" he said 
matter-of-factly. "You know, like what did I do wrong that it happened to me?" 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Brock shook her head and forced a smile. "It was nothing you did, honey. 
Now why don't you go back out and play." 
</P>
<P>
Adam thought about it for a moment and then made an announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone should have their bone marrow tested when they're born," he 
said. "That way there would always be a match and no one would have to die from 
leukemia." 
</P>
<P>
With that, he jumped up and ran back outside to shoot more baskets with his 
3-year-old brother, Bobby. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Brock sighed and stared out the window after Adam. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone tells me his disease is fatal, but I just can't believe it," she 
paused a moment and tears filled her eyes. "He doesn't look sick. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is real," she continued. "If we don't find a donor, we could lose 
him."

LOW-WATER TOILETS: 1.6-GALLON ANSWER TO CALIFORNIA'S DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern Californians must look to their bathrooms for drought relief. 
</P>
<P>
This was clearly established by the recent decision by the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power to pay consumer rebates to people who install 
water-stingy toilets. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I were already considering buying what the plumbing industry calls 
a low-flush toilet when our old toilet forced our hand. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, it was one of those episodes that happens just when the entire 
household is trying to leave for work. The toilet, an older model that probably 
required 5 to 7 gallons per flush, gave up the ghost. 
</P>
<P>
Buying time through furious use of a plunger and drain-clearance chemicals, I 
set out to hurriedly investigate replacement. And in doing so, I found that 
what seemed like a comparatively simple home-maintenance task was a consumer 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
As plumbing fixture manufacturers have discovered, the market is now crowded 
with low-flush toilets, a line of products that virtually didn't exist five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles city officials responsible for enforcing ordinances mandating use 
of water-stingy fixtures say there may be two dozen brands on the market. 
</P>
<P>
They illustrate the evolution of water conservation concerns in plumbing 
design. Thirty years ago, toilets required seven gallons to flush. Then, 
5-gallon models were introduced. Within the last decade, 3.5-gallon toilets -- 
now misleadingly called "water-saver" models -- appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Within the last five years, the standard has dropped to 1.6 gallons -- even as 
little as one gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure on manufacturers to develop low-flush toilets has intensified in the 
last year with introduction of legislation -- now pending in Congress -- that 
would mandate that only toilets requiring 1.6 gallons or less per flush be used 
in new construction or sold as replacements. 
</P>
<P>
The federal toilet bill is held up in the House and Senate, where action isn't 
likely before later this year, at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
But several cities and states have passed laws mandating 1.6-gallon flushing. 
The California drought illustrates why the rush to codify has occurred. Another 
dry spell in the East as severe as 1988's would probably hasten a federal 
mandate, congressional observers believe. 
</P>
<P>
Yet these developments don't address the consumer's first and vital question: 
Away from the testing laboratory and advertising agency photo studio and 
installed in your home, will a toilet that flushes with just 1.6 gallons of 
water really work? 
</P>
<P>
Since we finished our frantic consumer research and had our new toilet 
installed in early January -- an Eljer high-pressure model that uses 1.4 
gallons per flush -- it has never required a second flush to clear the bowl. 
</P>
<P>
But in arriving at this point we encountered divisions of opinion and 
conflicting advice. 
</P>
<P>
First, the plumber we use warned that low-flush toilets may not introduce 
enough water into drain lines to propel wastes to the sewer quickly enough. 
This, in turn, could eventually result in clogs in the drain line leading 
across the yard and to the sewer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the plumber said, three or four brands of low-flush toilets he had 
installed right after they were first introduced simply didn't function as 
advertised. Customers who bought them insisted that they be ripped out. 
</P>
<P>
For people who rely on septic tanks, he said, the low-flush water amounts could 
inhibit the natural degrading of wastes by not introducing enough water into 
the septic tank and leech fields. 
</P>
<P>
These concerns had also attracted the attention of the plumbing industry. In 
turn, the American Society of Plumbing Engineers organized a study, retaining 
Alfred Steele, a noted Florida-based engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns over septic tanks are groundless -- the reduced water flow probably is 
beneficial, Steele said. And although the sewer line research is not yet 
complete, Steele said preliminary studies indicate low-flush toilets won't 
damage or plug drain lines and will clear wastes just as readily as models that 
use three or four times as much water. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become a public and emotional issue more than it is technical," Steele 
said of the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Tests show that low-flush toilets push wastes 40 feet down a drain line with 
each flush cycle -- the same distance required of toilets that use much more 
water, he said. 
</P>
<P>
To make sure that there is no difference in this performance between laboratory 
studies and field conditions, Steele said, tests will be conducted in homes in 
Florida, Arizona and Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Our experience may or may not be scientifically representative, but our 
1.4-gallon toilet has resulted in no perceptible change in drain behavior 
anywhere in our house. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any reason, I asked Steele, to put off the purchase of a low-flush 
toilet or have any concern that today's water-conserving models won't function 
as intended? "None that I can think of," Steele said. But, he cautioned, "buy 
from a reputable manufacturer." 
</P>
<P>
The decision on which brand was more difficult. There are several 
considerations. First, some low-flush toilets -- especially foreign-made models 
-- use mechanical components that are not standardized with what can be bought 
at the average hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
Second, some manufacturers have jumped into the low-flush market, only to bail 
out. 
</P>
<P>
For example, we had seen an effective low-flush toilet in use at a hotel in Big 
Sur. The hotel referred me to its plumbing contractor, who reported that the 
distributor had vanished, leaving owners of the toilets unable to find 
replacement parts. 
</P>
<P>
Our search for a brand to buy included review of half a dozen domestic and 
foreign-made toilets. Eventually, the field narrowed to two candidates: Eljer 
and Kohler. 
</P>
<P>
Even major manufacturers have had some trouble with the products. Kohler's 
1.6-gallon model has experienced some problems with its filler-valve not 
closing properly in the flush cycle. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, said a Kohler spokeswoman, the firm was forced to temporarily 
suspend shipments from the factory and send replacement valves to wholesalers 
and retail outlets. The problem never affected the toilet's flushing 
efficiency, Kohler said. 
</P>
<P>
There are two generic low-flush types. In one, the entire contents of the water 
tank empty through the bowl, propelled by gravity in the same way most home 
toilets have always worked. 
</P>
<P>
The second type -- and the type we bought -- has a large reserve tank, but the 
tank has an inner compartment containing the 1.6 gallons of water, while ours 
contains 1.4 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
When the flush cycle begins, these models -- called pressure toilets -- use the 
gravitational push mustered by all 5 gallons to make the 1.6 gallons actually 
used rush through with significantly increased force. 
</P>
<P>
The sides of the bowl are at a much higher angle than in conventional toilets 
and water in the bowl remains at a much lower visible level than in 
conventional toilets. Our low-flush Eljer is about as noisy as the old one, but 
refills much faster. 
</P>
<P>
Eljer said it has sold about 200,000 of the model we bought -- called the 
"Ultra-One G." It's named that, ironically, even though it uses 1.4 gallons. 
The name was adopted when the model was introduced in 1984, an Eljer spokesman 
said, and it actually did use just one gallon. But that wasn't enough water to 
clean the bowl, the company said, and the design was modified to 1.4 gallons a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Shopping around, we found most discount plumbing suppliers offered the Eljer 
for $180 to $195 -- the approximate price range for all of the basic models of 
new pressure-operated low-flush toilets. 
</P>
<P>
Gravity models can be found for as little as half that price. Our plumber 
wouldn't install it if we bought it from someone else because of concern the 
unfamiliar new toilet could be damaged. But having said that, he agreed to 
price the toilet we bought competitively -- just $10 more than the lowest we 
found at discount stores. Fair enough, I figured. 
</P>
<P>
Ours was the first such toilet our plumber had ever installed. I did some 
calculations as he worked and figure that our household -- two adults, no 
children -- may save between 8,500 and 12,000 gallons of water this year.

HOT PROPERTY: FOR SPIELBERG, IT'S 'ALWAYS' MALIBU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STEVEN SPIELBERG has purchased a 3-acre gated retreat on a Malibu bluff. 
</P>
<P>
The property has a four-bedroom, three-bath house, built in 1955, and what has 
been described as "an incredible coastline view." 
</P>
<P>
The house also has a view of the producer/director's former home on Broad 
Beach, which is being rebuilt after receiving damage in a fire. "I think 
(actress) Amy (Irving) got that house in her divorce last year from Spielberg," 
a Malibu broker said. 
</P>
<P>
Spielberg's new home has lush lawns and gardens and 285 feet of private beach. 
The house, which is Southwestern in style, has a master suite with a spa and 
full gym. There are also servants quarters on the site. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors were asking $25,000 a month for a short-term lease, but Spielberg was 
among three superstars who considered buying it, said another local broker who 
identified Bruce Springsteen and Barbra Streisand as the other celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
Through a trust, Spielberg paid $6 million for the property, public records 
show. Escrow closed a few days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Blanchard, a commercial real estate developer known for his work along 
Ocean Front Walk -- a two-block stretch of the Venice boardwalk -- sold the 
property to Spielberg and is buying two parcels nearby for $7 million, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Mark of the Fred Sands Malibu office couldn't be reached for comment, but 
sources said he represented both parties in the Spielberg deal. 
</P>
<P>
More on Malibu . . . JOHN HOUSEMAN'S Malibu Colony home from the late '30s or 
early '40s until he died in 1988 has been sold for $3.25 million, according to 
real estate sources. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard for Joan (his widow)," a neighbor said, "because the house was so 
full of mementoes -- even flowers that he potted on the patio." 
</P>
<P>
Houseman, once a Vassar English professor, was best known as a movie 
producer/director/writer who had starring roles in such TV programs as "Paper 
Chase" and "The Winds of War." 
</P>
<P>
His widow sold their Malibu home, on the water, and their New York apartment 
and bought a house in Pacific Palisades from Jeff Berg, chairman of the talent 
agency ICM, realty sources added. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Rapf of Jim Rapf &amp; Associates had the listing but wouldn't comment. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the water . . . BRONSON PINCHOT, co-star of the ABC-TV sitcom "Perfect 
Strangers" who appeared in January in the ABC comedy "Jury Duty" with Alan 
Thicke, is planning to build a house similar to some he saw recently in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"He was on an extensive trip over the holidays and decided to build a 
Mediterranean villa reminiscent of the Greek isles on some Malibu property he 
already owns," said architect Robert Earl, who is just beginning the drawings. 
</P>
<P>
Earl is also designing eight houses, 6,000 to 7,000 square feet each, for a 
Columbia Residential Development project about to start construction at Trancas 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
North of Zuma Beach . . . MO OSTIN, president of Warner Records, and his wife, 
Evelyn, have just gotten their Malibu home updated to the tune of $2 million, 
estimated sources not involved in the work. 
</P>
<P>
The Ostins, who also have a home in Brentwood, bought the Malibu house a couple 
of years ago from rock star Rod Stewart, the sources added. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's Malibu house has five bedrooms and eight baths in 7,500 square 
feet, built in the '60s. Wayne Newhouse's Malibu construction company 
refurbished it, and John Patton handled the redecorating. 
</P>
<P>
In a canyon . . . DAVID FOSTER, producer/arranger for Neil Diamond and other 
recording stars, has sold his 2-acre Malibu property near the homes of 
producer/director/actor Michael Landon and rock-star Pat Benatar. 
</P>
<P>
Foster leased a house up the road and sold his home, with a recording studio, 
for its full asking price of $2.35 million, real estate sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The buyers are the Robert Greers, a Malibu family with two children, who were 
living in a smaller version of Foster's Tudor-style house. They plan to convert 
the recording studio to a guest house, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Pritchett of Pritchett Realty represented Foster; Carol Rapf represented 
the Greers. 
</P>
<P>
Once owned by LIBERACE . . . JACK H. HARRIS, who produced "The Blob" and 
"Beware! The Blob," just finished remodeling the Malibu co-op he bought about 1 
1/2 years ago for $295,000 from the Liberace estate. 
</P>
<P>
Liberace had used the unit, next to one he occupied, for his guests. Harris 
spent about $250,000 redoing the 1,000-square-foot unit through Newhouse 
Construction Co. 
</P>
<P>
Just beyond Malibu . . . HARVEY and MARILYN DIAMOND, authors of the 
best-selling "Fit for Life" book and diet, are planning to move from the home 
they built three years ago in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
They've put the five-bedroom, five-bath house on the market, at $2.1 million, 
and are negotiating to buy in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
"The Diamonds really practice what they preach," said Brian Panella, who listed 
their house through Jon Douglas Co.'s Malibu offices. "They planted thousands 
of dollars worth of fruit trees, raspberries, strawberries and blackberries 
that they use in their every-day diet." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-acre site consists of three contiguous parcels, including the one with 
the 7,000-square-foot, Tudor-style house. 
</P>
<P>
P.S. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Original Racquet Club, the Palm Springs tennis resort that was founded in 
1933 by actors CHARLES FARRELL and RALPH BELLAMY and catered to such 
early-Hollywood stars as Clark Gable and Joan Crawford, is for sale. 
</P>

DOCUMENTS: A CONSUMER'S GUIDE TO THE MOUNTAINS OF PAPER WORK YOU'LL ENCOUNTER 
WHEN BUYING OR SELLING A HOME.

<P>
Sometimes it seems as if you are shuffling and signing enough documents to 
paper the walls of your prospective new home. Documents for the real estate 
agent, for the bank, for the escrow officer. 
</P>
<P>
If you are selling your old place, there are contracts, disclosures, tax 
statements, sign here, sign there, this is required by the local realtors 
board, this is required by state law, this is required by the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
At last, escrow closes. You turn the key in your new front door, walk into the 
empty place, plop wearily on your new floor and have what may be your first 
chance to think about it: What was all that paper? 
</P>
<P>
Longtime brokers recall when a seller filled out a one-page statement and a 
buyer's purchase offer was half a page long, with any contingencies written at 
the bottom. But buyers sometimes found nasty surprises in their new homes. 
</P>
<P>
Changes in state and federal laws in the past decade have mandated disclosures 
about the property, the role of the real estate agent, financing terms and 
other aspects of the home buying transaction. 
</P>
<P>
The result is twofold: "Buyers are about as protected as they can be," said 
Woodland Hills realtor James R. Gary. And buyers, sellers, lenders and realtors 
are dealing with more paper work than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a guide to the paper work you are likely to encounter when you sell or 
buy a home that will be, in industry parlance, owner-occupied: 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure Regarding Real Estate Agency Relationships. This is the first paper 
you will see. Required by state Civil Code since 1988. It explains that the 
listing agency (not the individual agent) may be representing the buyer as well 
as the seller. This is called "dual agency." 
</P>
<P>
An example: You list your house with Joe of ABC Realty, and Sally of ABC Realty 
finds you a buyer. ABC Realty, then, is representing both you and the buyer. In 
other words, don't expect your listing agent and the buyer's agent to be 
adversaries. You can "elect" for your real estate agency to represent you only, 
but that means you must rely on agents who work for other agencies to find you 
a buyer, which would sharply cut the number of potential buyers for your home. 
Most people go for dual agency. 
</P>
<P>
Seller's Affidavit of Nonforeign Status. Inspired by the Foreign Investment in 
Real Property Tax Act, which provides that a foreigner who sells property in 
the United States has to pay the same taxes on any gains as a U.S. citizen. By 
filling it out, you are saying that you are either a U.S. citizen or a resident 
alien. For a foreigner who is not a U.S. resident alien, the IRS and the state 
require that taxes be withheld on the sale price. If you don't supply the buyer 
with this affidavit, the buyer and broker are responsible for withholding about 
13.3% of the sales price for state and federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Real Estate Transfer Disclosure Statement. California law has required this one 
since 1987. In this fairly straightforward form, you list all the features of 
your home, such as built-in appliances, air conditioning, fireplace, spa, 
sprinklers; also, facts about utility services and the age of the roof. 
</P>
<P>
This is the place to detail any problems in the home, or anything the new owner 
will want to know. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell my sellers to be 100% brutally frank," says Annette V. Graw, 
broker-owner of South Bay Brokers Inc. in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Remodeling or repairs that don't meet code? Cracks in the foundation? Train 
noise? Homeowners association restrictions? A pipe that has rattled once in the 
20 years you have lived there? Disclose it all, Graw advises. 
</P>
<P>
If you fail to mention something, you could be liable. Your real estate agent 
looks the property over, then makes comments on it in a second part of the 
form. This is coordinated with disclosures of problems that might be exclusive 
to your area, such as a special studies zone, bond issue assessment, Metro Rail 
construction, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Potential Disturbance Disclosure. James R. Gary, of the Woodland Hills 
brokerage that bears his name, adds this to the standard disclosures. It 
reminds the buyer in gently mocking tones of the serious possibility of 
mudslides, domestic and wild animals in the area, radio and vehicle noise, 
crime, pollution, insects, airplanes flying over and trains going by. 
</P>
<P>
Additional disclosures. Never underestimate the ability of people to find 
reasons to sue. With this in mind, some brokers make a point of providing 
information about features peculiar to their area. Gary, for instance, 
discloses routes being studied for future light-rail lines and freeways, flood 
control projects, scheduled major freeway repairs and the like. Buyers and 
sellers sign to acknowledge that they've gotten copies. 
</P>
<P>
Seller Financing Disclosure Statement. If you plan to carry financing, this 
form (required since 1983) spells out the terms of the loan. In the current 
market, with loans plentiful, seller financing is not used as much as, say, in 
the early '80s when credit was tight. 
</P>
<P>
Exclusive Authorization and Right to Sell. This is your contract with a real 
estate broker to list your home. It tells when the listing starts, when it 
ends, the asking price, what the agent's commission will be, whether you are 
willing to carry any financing, whether there will be a key box and a sign on 
the property, what you intend to do about pest control, and how any disputes 
with the broker will be handled. 
</P>
<P>
There are other types of listing agreements, but this is the one used in the 
majority of sales. 
</P>
<P>
Multiple Listing Service agreement. This one summarizes the square footage and 
major features of the house, for publication by the local MLS. Some local 
realty boards require member realtors to list all property in the MLS, unless 
the seller specifically forbids it. The law has nothing to do with this. 
</P>
<P>
Once you've made it through these documents, the process of selling your home 
begins. If anything changes -- a pipe bursts, or your agent persuades you to 
change the price, for example -- new disclosures or contracts must be signed. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the papers involved when you go to buy another home. Here are 
the ones needed when buying a resale home: 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure Regarding Real Estate Agency Relationships. Again, this tells you 
that the agent who shows you a house and the agent who listed the house may be 
working for the same broker and are not adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
Additional disclosures. As a prospective buyer, you may have to sign 
acknowledging receipt of information about things peculiar to the area you are 
shopping in. Noise, fumes, possible future rail, freeway or airport projects -- 
these are things you will want to know about, and the realtor and/or seller may 
want it in writing that you have been told. 
</P>
<P>
Real Estate Purchase Contract and Receipt for Deposit. This is your offer, and 
it is a contract. It can take two hours to fill out, but don't rush through it: 
With this document you are committing yourself, and you had better be sure you 
understand everything in it. 
</P>
<P>
Your offer contract has 23 items on it, and each one can be a negotiating 
point. "Anything you want the seller to do (such as repairs, pest inspection or 
financing help) has to be in this contract," Graw notes. 
</P>
<P>
This specifies the down payment, the kind of loan, when you will take 
possession of the house, receipt of your "earnest money" deposit. The terms may 
change -- and everything will (or should) be put in writing -- during 
negotiations with the seller. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, you will not see the seller's Transfer Disclosure Statement (TDS) 
when your offer is written. Once you have seen the TDS, you have three days to 
back out if you find something there that you don't like. 
</P>
<P>
Contract Supplement. Any unusual contingencies (such as having to sell a house 
before you can buy one) go into this write-your-own contract for things not in 
the Purchase Contract form.

SAM HALL KAPLAN: A SENSE OF PLACE IN AN AGE OF ALIENATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The focus of architecture's spotlight in recent decades has been on private 
projects: idiosyncratically designed single-family houses, boldly styled 
corporate office towers, flamboyantly decorated festival markets and malls and 
independent institutions searching for a signature structure. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial projects obviously were designed to engage customers and 
clients, but still, when you walk through their doors, you are on private 
ground, a guest. A shopping center, no matter how inviting, is not a public 
street or a park. 
</P>
<P>
As for most of the other private efforts, they have been isolated, inaccessible 
objects, located behind fences, hedges and guarded gates, contributing little 
to the public experience of the city and the civic pride of its residents. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, an argument can be made that the waves of indulgent private 
architecture of recent years -- the mini-malls, monster mansions, obese office 
towers and other anti-contextual exercises -- have heightened the depressing 
sense of anomie that marks most of our cities in this age of alienation. 
</P>
<P>
But there are a few hopeful signs that the currents of architecture are 
changing and that public projects fashioned to engender a sense of pride and 
place once again will be a major focus of the design community, as it was at 
the beginning of the century. 
</P>
<P>
During that period, in the wake of the so-called City Beautiful movement, a 
variety of public projects blossomed. 
</P>
<P>
These included what are now some of Los Angeles' most prominent architectural 
landmarks, such as the Central Library, City Hall, Exposition Park and the 
Beverly Hills and Pasadena civic centers. 
</P>
<P>
And it is civic centers that once again are pacing architecture's public 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
Nearing completion is the ambitious expansion of the Beverly Hills civic 
center. It is a fanciful plan that includes a new firehouse, police station, 
library and city offices focused on three palm-lined oval courtyards, styled in 
the Spanish Baroque spirit of the 1931 City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The $83-million project, when completed at the end of this year, promises to 
offer an appropriately extravagant public focus for a city known for its 
private extravagances. 
</P>
<P>
It was designed with a flourish by Charles Moore and the Urban Innovations 
Group, and the landscape architectural firm of Campbell &amp; Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Also under way is the expansion and revitalization of the landmark Pasadena 
civic center, a marvelous collection of classically styled public structures 
sited in the beaux-arts tradition of the City Beautiful movement and centered 
on a wedding cake of a City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion includes a new police station (designed by nouvelle classicist 
Robert Stern), extensive landscaping and street furnishings (once again by the 
traditionalist Campbell &amp; Campbell) and a sensitive mix of complementary 
commercial and residential uses (by mix master Johannes Van Tilburg). 
</P>
<P>
"The object is to lend new life to old spaces, building upon the generations of 
pride Pasadena residents feel for the civic center," said Marsha Rood of the 
city's redevelopment agency. "We want to reinforce the center's place as the 
focal point of the city." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, the recently completed first phase of the 
Romantic-Spanish-styled Escondido civic center is drawing rave reviews as a 
public place during the workweek and a setting for weddings on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Also promising is the modest, accessible design for Oceanside's new civic 
center, now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately not being constructed is the West Hollywood civic center, the 
plan for which has narrowly defeated last year by 170 or so votes in a 
controversy concerning the proposed site at San Vicente and Santa Monica 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
The plan called for a distinctive assemblage of public buildings and spaces 
(designed by Chang &amp; Sherman, with Gruen Associates), offering the 
fledgling city a needed identity. A new site is being sought. 
</P>
<P>
The latest plan for a civic center comes out of Culver City, which a few weeks 
ago approved an energetic scheme that seeks to lend the city a sense of history 
while providing its downtown with a focus. 
</P>
<P>
Both are desperately needed, for Culver City appears at present to be not much 
more than a fragmented collection of residential enclaves in a confused web of 
ugly commercial strips that slice and dice the city into unappealing bits and 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
And this despite the city's increasing attractiveness as one of the few 
reasonably priced areas on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan is an outgrowth of civic pride, or perhaps more accurately, a search 
for civic pride," said Culver City's community development director Jody 
Hall-Esser. 
</P>
<P>
She explained that in orchestrating the limited competition and public review 
that led to the selection of the plan, it was obvious that "people were looking 
for some identification with the city, a flag in the wind." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly appealing is that the winning plan by the architectural firm of 
CHCG went beyond just designing a City Hall that the competition called for, 
and addressed the issue of a civic center and the potential there for a 
pedestrian experience. 
</P>
<P>
The new city hall is to be located on a site encompassing the old, 
earthquake-unsound City Hall at Culver Boulevard and Duquesne Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of siting the parking at ground level in the rear of the new City Hall 
as originally suggested, it places it below grade, with access by an open, 
lushly landscaped stairway to a formal square in front of the building and open 
to the street. 
</P>
<P>
The result is an accessible, attractive public space in the rich tradition of 
the Spanish Mission style the city requested the center take. 
</P>
<P>
In a gesture to the city's past, the existing facade of the old City Hall is 
saved to form an arch for a heritage park featuring historically symbolic 
plantings and materials. 
</P>
<P>
The facade also will block in part the view to the northwest of the obnoxious, 
over-scaled MGM building and its loading dock. There are plans to further 
divert the view toward a plaza across the street, and the welcome redevelopment 
of the Moderne-styled Culver Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Distinguishing the plan is the clear intent not to treat the new City Hall as 
just a public service building, but rather as the "corner stone" of an effort 
to "protect and extend pedestrian and public values" in the renaissance of 
downtown, according to CHCG's David Goodale. 
</P>
<P>
There are still questions concerning the detailing and massing of the City 
Hall, in particular how it can be more assertive in its relationship to the 
street and its neighbor to the northeast, the Mission-styled Meralta office 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City does not need another syrupy suburban exercise. It is time for it 
to become a city. The civic center would be a start.

SPEAKING OUT: SOUND GROWTH POLICIES CASUALTY OF SPECIAL INTERESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILLIP R. NICHOLSON, Phillip R. Nicholson is a partner in the law firm of 
Cox, Castle &amp; Nicholson. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proverbial story of the blind man and the elephant tells us a great deal 
about the politics of growth in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The blind man tries valiantly to identify the strange beast before him by 
touching different parts of the elephant. But an accurate picture of the whole 
animal eludes him. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise in growth management in our region. During the last decade, we have 
seen an unprecedented trend in urban planning emerge: the proliferation of 
special-interest community organizations and special-purpose government 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, citizen activists opposed to commercial and residential 
development were typically fragmented groups. Today they exercise enormous and 
sometimes crippling power in decisions ranging from density to architectural 
design. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, we have seen the creation of numerous special-purpose 
government agencies such as the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
These agencies bring outstanding technical skills to combating problems, but 
typically only in a single area of expertise. 
</P>
<P>
What we lack is a vision of the whole "animal" -- a rational process of making 
decisions that balances the costs and benefits of growth and resolves issues of 
diverse special interests. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the emergence of single-purpose government agencies, clearly one of 
the most significant trends in governance in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Just a decade ago, a developer planning to build homes or a commercial project 
typically applied to just one entity -- the city or country -- and one agency 
-- a planning or building department -- to obtain the right to build. 
</P>
<P>
These agencies juggled many competing values: environmental, the economic 
well-being of the community and political realities facing elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
The decade of the 1990s begins in a much different milieu. 
</P>
<P>
Runaway growth has sparked widespread concerns about diminishing "quality of 
life" that has typified California living. There is increased recognition that 
many of these problems go far beyond local capabilities, calling for federal, 
state and regional initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
The result: the debut of numerous single-purpose entities created to regulate a 
specific type of resource or pollutant. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District, for instance, has jurisdiction 
over air quality. Meeting federal air quality guidelines administered by this 
regional gency in the next 20 years will touch virtually every business and 
household in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In another area, the state Water Quality Board has jurisdiction over water 
quality issues. Developers in areas such as Ventura County must now meet 
regulations involved in formal water quality plans. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Fish and Game and Department of Wildlife oversee a separate 
regulatory mission in relation to animals and plants. The Coastal Commission 
controls development along the coastline and the Army Corps of Engineers has 
authority over any building involving wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Business must thread its way through a web of regulations governed by each of 
these agencies, whose sole mission generally involves one resource or 
pollutant. While the purview of each agency represents a very important piece 
of the overall puzzle, too often it does not take into account the full scope 
of community needs. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District, for instance, has no mandate 
to consider the economic consequences of its rule-making and policies. 
</P>
<P>
We see the same tendency in the growth of special-interest community 
organizations and the initiative process. 
</P>
<P>
Public dissatisfaction with actions taken to control growth and improve the 
quality of life has given rise to a flourishing populism. Decision makers 
struggling with complex choices and problems with no easy solutions are 
"punished" by impatient voters for refusing to take simplistic stands. 
</P>
<P>
Officials lose elections or find their hands tied by initiatives or legislation 
that give even more power to single-purpose government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13, for instance, put a stranglehold on local governments' ability 
to raise revenue for public services ranging from new sewer construction to 
road improvements. 
</P>
<P>
With tax revenue for public services depleted, local governments throughout 
California turned to user fees. Fees levied on developers, however, ultimately 
are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices and spiraling home 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Rent control in Santa Monica has preserved lower rents for a select group of 
renters but at a high price to landlords, the business community and potential 
residents who cannot rent an apartment because of extremely low-vacancy rates. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, voters have coalesced into special-interest groups to exert 
influence on decision makers and wield power in the rule-making process of 
single-purpose agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The Friends of Westwood, for instance, participates in nearly every land-use 
decision of any magnitude in Westwood. One of the most successful citizen 
groups of its type, it is a powerful force on the side of improving the quality 
of life in Westwood, a stance which generally translates into fighting for a 
lower intensity of development. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, we see citizen groups at work. The Sierra Club, for instance, once 
focused primarily on preserving wilderness areas. It now actively fights 
subdivisions and growth in undeveloped areas of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the rise in importance of special-interest groups and 
single-purpose agencies has not been accompanied by a method of balancing 
decisions made from a narrow frame of reference. 
</P>
<P>
Each organization fights its battles in one arena. What is lost is a rational 
approach that weighs the costs and benefits of decisions across the full range 
of community needs -- the economic as well as the environmental. 
</P>
<P>
One casualty was the defeat of the transportation bond initiative. While most 
Californians agree that transportation systems are critically overloaded, the 
initiative failed by a decisive margin, in part due to fears relating to new 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise in Orange County, Proposition M, which proposed a half-cent 
transportation sales tax, was defeated last November, despite the urgent need 
to relieve traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
The proposition, designed to raise $3.1 billion over the 20 years, would have 
financed widened freeways, new lanes reserved for car pools and buses, 
streamlined "super" streets and rail transit. And, it included growth 
management rules intended to pace development with traffic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Ill-informed votes spring from a desire to find simple answers to complex 
questions. We cannot simply say "no" to economic developments as a way of 
mitigating environmental concerns. Nor do wholesale growth-control ordinances 
solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
When one jurisdiction puts a moratorium on or restricts new housing 
construction, neighboring cities are then forced to provide housing for the 
work force. 
</P>
<P>
As the buildable area diminishes and political pressure grows, the 
responsibility to provide a housing solution is passed from one jurisdiction to 
the next. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, we find businesses being forced to relocate to outlying areas where 
adequate supplies of housing at more affordable prices may still be found. 
</P>
<P>
Companies are flocking to Riverside County where the median home price is about 
$50,000 less than a home of equivalent size in Orange County. Meanwhile, the 
economies of other communities adopting growth controls cool because of 
well-intended but short-sighted actions. 
</P>
<P>
The politics of growth in Southern California also disenfranchise some groups. 
Among these are lower- and middle-income families who cannot afford to own a 
home, as well as future residents of the region. 
</P>
<P>
The core of the conflict may be easily summed up. While no one wants to pay for 
growth, most residents want the economic vitality and standard of living that 
comes with it. Managing growth offers our only viable solution. 
</P>
<P>
Special-purpose government agencies can make a critical contribution by using 
their considerable technical expertise to undertake cost-benefit analyses that 
address economic issues before adopting rules that will have impact on 
virtually every business and household in the region. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, voters and community organizations must participate in making 
responsible decisions -- rather than simply supporting Draconian growth-control 
initiatives that harm the region. That means being better informed and more 
willing to understand the economic implications of votes cast on propositions 
and initiatives relating to urban growth. 
</P>
<P>
Sound growth management requires that diverse and often conflicting special 
interests be balanced within the context of the greatest possible good of the 
community.

HOW TO DEDUCT CASUALTY LOSSES; 
</P>
<P>
TAXES: THE IRS ALLOWS DEDUCTIONS FOR CERTAIN LOSSES. BUT TO QUALIFY, THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES MUST BE 'SUDDEN, UNEXPECTED OR UNUSUAL.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS

<TEXT>
<P>
Nineteen eighty-nine was an especially bad year for casualty losses. Major 
events such as Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake caused 
multibillion-dollar losses. But millions of taxpayers with less spectacular 
"sudden, unexpected or unusual" casualty losses can also claim deductions on 
their income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
Fire. Tornado. Theft. Vandalism. Broken water pipes. Earthquake. Windstorm. 
Hail damage. Accident. Hurricane. Flood. These are some of the major causes of 
deductible casualty losses. 
</P>
<P>
Business casualty losses are fully deductible. However, only net uninsured 
personal casualty losses that exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income qualify 
for this deduction. If you are insured, but don't want to file a claim for fear 
of insurance cancellation or any other reason, then you cannot claim a casualty 
loss deduction. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate how the personal casualty-loss deduction works, suppose your 
adjusted gross income is $50,000, and you had a $20,000 fire loss, but 
insurance only paid $12,000 of your repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
Of your $8,000 uninsured loss, $5,000, or 10%, of your $50,000 adjusted gross 
income is not deductible, leaving a $3,000-casualty loss deduction. However, 
the first $100 of each casualty loss event is non-deductible, so your net 
deduction would be $2,900. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the loss must be "sudden, unexpected or unusual." For example, 
termite damage to your home is usually not deductible because it occurs very 
slowly, often over many years. However, if you can prove that your termites 
worked very fast within just a few months, several Tax Court decisions have 
allowed the losses. 
</P>
<P>
Other non-qualifying slow-damage examples include Dutch elm tree disease, 
erosion, well contamination, carpet beetles, dry rot, normal wear and tear and 
old age. However, if a qualifying event causes the loss, then a casualty loss 
may result. For example, if a flash flood causes your rotted front porch to 
collapse, then you have a deductible casualty loss. 
</P>
<P>
Because casualty losses are often large, IRS auditors love to audit these 
deductions. Taxpayers should be prepared with solid proof of loss, such as 
police reports, photos, appraisals, repair bills, receipts, insurance 
settlements and other evidence. Your personal estimate of the before and after 
valuation or replacement cost is usually insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 10% of adjusted gross income limit for personal, 
non-business casualty losses, any insurance settlement and the $100 per event 
floor must be subtracted when calculating the deduction. Use IRS form 4684 and 
itemize the loss on Schedule A of your federal tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
The direct casualty loss, however, cannot exceed your adjusted cost basis in 
the property. But indirect costs, such as temporary housing, moving costs, 
legal expenses, crop damage and property protection fees also are deductible. 
</P>
<P>
If your loss deduction eliminates your 1989 income tax, you can carry any 
excess loss back to 1986, 1987 and 1988 for a tax refund, then forward up to 15 
years until the loss is completely offset by your taxable income.

AMERICA'S HOUSING: AIDS BRINGS ANOTHER TWIST TO DISCLOSURE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE COLLINS, Collins is a Washington, D.C., writer who has covered 
real estate for several years and is co-author of the book Selling Out, which 
chronicles the impact of Japanese foreign investment in the United States. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twice last year, realtor Bob Linn, president of Bob Linn &amp; Associates in 
Oklahoma City, confronted a thorny problem that is facing more and more brokers 
across the country: He was asked to sell properties for homeowners he suspected 
had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no guidance. How do you handle this situation?" Linn asked. "If we 
don't disclose (the information) and sell the property, and later the buyer 
finds out, will he sue us? If we do disclose and can't sell the property, will 
the seller sue us for slander?" 
</P>
<P>
A Maryland realtor faced a similar problem in selling a property with a 
"history." 
</P>
<P>
A double murder and suicide had occurred there. He was advised by attorneys to 
show the house as usual and disclose the tragic occurrence sometime toward the 
end of the prospective buyer's tour. But first he obtained written permission 
from the seller to disclose the information. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure issues -- such as property defects or the use of hazardous materials 
-- usually involve material facts and have become increasingly important in the 
real estate industry. 
</P>
<P>
But the newest twist on the theme, that of psychological impacts, involves 
facts not associated with the property itself but with its owner or occupant. 
</P>
<P>
California passed the first law governing disclosure of information relating to 
AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The law was straightforward. 
</P>
<P>
"If the realtor doesn't make a disclosure, there is no legal recourse (for the 
buyer), based on the premise that AIDS is not a condition that affects the 
condition of the property," said Alex Creel, vice president of governmental 
affairs for the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
California amended its disclosure legislation in 1987 to include deaths that 
had occurred on a property. If a death had occurred more than three years prior 
to the purchase offer, the broker and seller cannot be sued for failure to 
disclose it. 
</P>
<P>
If the death had taken place within three years, the law is not as clear. If 
the property had been the site of a sensational murder or something similar 
that affects the value of the property, it must be disclosed. Short of that, a 
lawyer may or may not advise disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the cause of death was AIDS or an AIDS-related illness, the seller 
has no obligation to disclose the information at any time under the law. 
</P>
<P>
California's law prompted the National Assn. of Realtors to write its own model 
legislation. At least a dozen other states had followed its example by late 
1989, and as the new decade begins, dozens of other states are considering 
similar laws. 
</P>
<P>
Such a law is necessary, Creel said, because without it, "the realtor was in 
the middle." He could be sued by buyers for not disclosing and by sellers for 
disclosing. 
</P>
<P>
"This (the disclosure issue) is a classic problem, one that we've had literally 
for years and years, although it didn't become acute until the AIDS crisis," 
said William North, NAR executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what we call 'disclosure of stigmatized property.' It also might be a 
haunted house, or a house where a suicide or murder occurred. It could be a 
house of former ill repute or a house in which a prominent man flaunted a 
mistress to the general public in defiance of social conventions." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the concern about disclosure of psychological facts began in 1983 with 
a California court case, Reed vs. King, which involved the sale of a house that 
10 years earlier had been the site of a multiple murder. 
</P>
<P>
Both the seller and his agent told the purchaser, an elderly woman living 
alone, that the house was ideal for her. After moving in, neighbors told the 
purchaser that no one had wanted to buy the property because of the murders. 
The buyer sued, alleging that the property was worth less than she paid because 
of its stigma. 
</P>
<P>
The trial court dismissed the case, but an appeals court decided that the 
seller has an obligation to disclose facts materially affecting the value of 
the property when the facts are known only to the seller and are not readily 
available to the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Reed vs. King was the first case to find cause for legal action against the 
seller for failure to disclose a stigma that adversely affected the value of a 
residential property. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors feared that the same logic could be used to establish a legal 
responsibility for disclosure of other stigmas, such as the stigma that might 
result because a house had been inhabited by a person afflicted with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically there has been little case law on this issue of stigmatized 
property," NAR's North said. "But with AIDS, we have an advocacy bar addressing 
the issue. With a haunted house, its reputation is generally well known. At 
sometime during the purchasing process someone will make a comment, 'Ha, ha, 
have you seen any ghosts yet?' so that it is very difficult to prove damages. 
They are psychic damages at best. 
</P>
<P>
"But with the case of AIDS, you have a major concern, a fear of the disease. 
Just like they used to burn homes and clothing of the victims of the Great 
Plague, there has been some inclination to shun areas where AIDS patients have 
resided. It has created considerable stress for the real estate broker 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"The seller wouldn't want this fact widely publicized, if the effect is to 
reduce the number of buyers or the price at which the property can be sold," 
North said. "And both the seller and broker have a legal obligation to reveal 
all material facts that might influence the decision to purchase. Thus, is AIDS 
a material fact?" 
</P>
<P>
That question was answered firmly in the negative by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
First, the report by the Presidential Commission on the Human Immuno-deficiency 
Virus Epidemic in June, 1988, addressed the issue of discrimination in housing 
and public accommodations, saying: "You cannot get AIDS from toilets, 
doorknobs, telephones, office machinery or household furniture." 
</P>
<P>
The next year, Congress passed an amendment to the Federal Fair Housing Act of 
1968, adding the handicapped -- including persons with AIDS -- as a new 
protected class. 
</P>
<P>
That meant that the real estate industry was prohibited from discriminating 
against those with AIDS in the sale or rental of property. 
</P>
<P>
Although the legislation does not specifically address the issue of disclosure, 
"such a disclosure could be considered a discriminatory action which is clearly 
prohibited by the Federal Fair Housing Act," according to a NAR discussion 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
What does the real estate broker do when asked specifically by the buyer if the 
seller has AIDS? 
</P>
<P>
"If you are asked by a potential purchaser, 'Is there any peculiar history to 
this house?' the new statutes do not authorize a broker to lie," said Mike 
Finn, director of license law at NAR. 
</P>
<P>
"But there are a number of options for the broker. He can say, 'Gee, let me ask 
the seller and find out if there are any things he will tell you.' But if the 
seller responds, 'That's none of your business,' that is acceptable under the 
law too." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise in California, according to Creel, "the law doesn't immunize a real 
estate broker and allow him to tell a lie or make an intentional 
misrepresentation. But that is very different from saying he must answer 
truthfully. He could beg off, but he couldn't say absolutely 'no.' He could 
certainly say, 'I am not prepared to answer that question.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Florida Assn. of Realtors has cautioned its members to respond "honestly" 
if questioned specifically about the presence of an AIDS victim in a residence 
that is for sale. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Ron Dusek, public information officer for the Texas attorney 
general's office responded, "How would they really know? They aren't doctors, 
and without knowing the medical history, how can they make a determination?"

CONDO Q &amp; A : LAW PERMITS BOARD TO LEVY ADDITIONAL FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, Hickenbottom is past president of the Greater Los Angeles 
chapter of the Community Associations Institute (CAI), a national nonprofit 
research and educational organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I would like more information regarding your answer, "Associations 
Entitled Legally to Raise Fees" (Feb. 11), about a community association 
board's authority to raise assessments up to 20% per year. 
</P>
<P>
I live in a condominium that passed an amendment to the declaration allowing 
increases only with the approval of 60% of the members except for emergency 
situations. Does the new law that you cited displace all previous provisions in 
the association's documents? How can a board of directors stay informed about 
changes in the law? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Yes, Section 1366 of the California Civil Code specifically states that 
regardless of more restrictive limitations in an association's documents, the 
board may increase regular assessments up to 20% of the previous year's 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
The board may also impose a special assessment that does not exceed 5% of the 
budgeted expenses. Higher increases are legal if more than 50% of the owners 
attend a meeting at which a majority of those present approve the increase. 
</P>
<P>
Proper notice must be given and the meeting must be conducted according to 
Section 7510 and Section 7613 of the Corporations Code. Your board can research 
the law by going to the county law library. Some local public libraries also 
have excellent legal reference books available. 
</P>
<P>
Since the law is changing frequently, make sure that you have current 
information. 
</P>
<P>
The board has the authority to approve an assessment increase greater than 20% 
if the increase is directly related to an emergency situation, such as an 
extraordinary expense required by a court order, an extraordinary repair or 
maintenance expense where a threat to personal safety is discovered, an 
extraordinary expense necessary to repair or maintain association property that 
was unforeseen at the time of preparation of the annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
The board must pass a resolution containing written evidence of the need for 
the repair and reasons why the expense was unforeseen. The resolution must be 
distributed to all the members with the notice of the assessment increase. 
</P>
<P>
California Civil Code, Section 1366.1 prohibits the association from collecting 
an assessment, penalty or fee that exceeds the amount necessary for the purpose 
for which it is collected. 
</P>
<P>
Community Associations Institute provides seminars and newsletters to keep 
boards of directors, managers and other professionals informed about changes in 
the laws governing community associations. There are chapters across the 
nation. You will find chapters in the following California cities: Los Angeles, 
San Diego, San Francisco, El Toro, Sacramento, Camarillo, Stockton and Palm 
Desert. 
</P>
<P>
New Owner Charged Steep Transfer Fee 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our association would like advice regarding the extra fees that we can 
charge to new owners. Can our homeowners association assess a new buyer a 
transfer fee of twice the monthly assessment fee for the unit being sold? 
</P>
<P>
A: That sounds like an unreasonable fee based on the laws governing ownership 
transfer fees. The seller is obligated to provide to the prospective buyer 
certain documents listed in California Civil Code, Section 1368. 
</P>
<P>
The association may be asked to provide these documents through the escrow 
company. The law allows the association to charge only the amount of the 
association's reasonable cost to prepare and reproduce the requested documents. 
</P>
<P>
Many management companies, operating as the agent for the association, charge 
$150 or more for this service. In my opinion, such fees are unreasonable and 
possibly illegal, based on the specific wording of the law. The cost is 
customarily passed on to the buyer at the closing of escrow. 
</P>
<P>
When challenged, managers say they are charging the fee because of the time 
spent on the phone with escrow and loan officers, real estate agents and others 
involved with the resale. One manager recently told me that he felt that the 
limit imposed by the law did not apply to management companies. 
</P>
<P>
Some managers and association boards are not aware that the association must 
provide the requested documents within 10 days of the written request. Any 
person or entity that willfully violates this section of the law is liable to 
the purchaser for actual damages as well as a civil penalty not to exceed $500. 
</P>
<P>
When selling my condominium, I provided the documents to the buyer myself and 
told the management company that I expected a reduction in the transfer fee 
since the only thing they were providing was a letter showing that there were 
no past-due assessments owed on the unit. 
</P>
<P>
The manager said that I shouldn't be concerned about the amount of the transfer 
fee since the buyer is the one who ends up paying. Sure enough, at the closing 
of escrow the buyer was charged a $150 transfer fee.

<TEXT>
<P>
Building your own frame cabin on a small parcel of land is an economical way to 
spend your leisure hours for vacations, holidays . . . any occasion. 
</P>
<P>
The secret of this cabin's success is its rigid frame system, which depends on 
the principle of the arch and provides a wide, clear span with no interior 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
The basic structure is 20-by-24 feet, but can be made larger by adding more 
frames. The covered deck and large expanses of glass on both end walls allow 
you to enjoy the surroundings of your cabin location. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was done in cooperation with the American Plywood Assn. and includes a 
complete step-by-step guide in constructing the cabin from clearing the ground 
to furnishing ideas. A detailed materials list and extra information on lumber 
are also included. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain Rigid Frame Cabin, Plan No. 370, please send $4.50. If you're 
interested in a second home but want to review different styles before 
selecting one, order No. A50 Vacation Homes Catalog, $4.95, featuring more than 
40 floor plans. Prices include postage and handling. California residents 
please add sales tax. Send check or money order to Steve Ellingson, c/o Los

HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: COPING WITH HAZARD OF DIFFERENT WIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We bought our home in 1985, and plan to add several new electrical 
circuits and install new light fixtures and ceiling fans into already existing 
circuits. The problem is that all circuits, switches, light fixtures, 
receptacles and appliance connections were wired with aluminum wiring 
components. 
</P>
<P>
We know we must replace failed switches and receptacles with ones that are 
approved for use with aluminum wiring, but we don't know what to do about 
installing new copper-wired fixtures in existing circuits. A friend warned us 
that connecting copper to aluminum wiring could create a fire hazard. Is this 
true? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Aluminum wiring is a potential fire hazard. Between 1965 and 1973 about 
1.5 million homes were wired with aluminum, which at the time was approved by 
the National Electrical Code. Later it was found that dangerous overheating in 
15- and 20-amp circuits, at some connections between aluminum wires and 
outlets, switches, fixtures and appliances resulted in fires. 
</P>
<P>
Correcting the problem does not require rewiring the house. You can replace 
switches and outlet receptacles that are unmarked or marked AL-CU, with devices 
that are marked CO-ALR. 
</P>
<P>
Or, you can use existing switches and outlets provided you attached short 
copper pigtails to the ends of the aluminum wires and to the devices 
(aluminum-to-aluminum splices are an exception). It's also necessary to connect 
light fixtures and appliances with copper pigtails. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the potential for a fire, it is important that copper wire pigtails 
be attached to aluminum wires with specially designed connectors (wire-nuts can 
be used, however, at copper-to-copper connections, such as light fixtures). 
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends using a compression-type 
crimp connector with heat-shrink insulation. These are called Copalum 
Compression Connectors. They, and the crimping tool used to install them, are 
made by AMP Inc., Copalum Program, MS 140-13 P.O. Box 360B, Harrisburg, Pa.

Furnace Blows Dust When It's Turned On 
</P>
<P>
Q: Several years ago, we had a furnace installed and started getting a great 
amount of dust every time it was on. When we had it checked out we discovered 
that a return air duct had been laid over the dirt floor in the crawl space 
with no cap, and all the dust was being brought into the house. Other than 
taking the ducts down to remove the dirt, is there anything we can do? 
</P>
<P>
A: All warm-air furnace systems must have a filter in the return duct to trap 
dirt and dust in the airstream. The filter prevents airborne particles from 
getting into the air. 
</P>
<P>
There could be several ways the airstream that enters the room picks up the 
particles. The filter may be dirty, it may not be the correct size or it may 
not have been installed properly so particles slip past it. Or, you may not 
even have a filter. 
</P>
<P>
If none of the above causes the problem, you should consider installing an 
electrostatic filter in the return duct. These filters are effective in 
removing dust and dirt from the air. 
</P>
<P>
We've assumed you've replaced the missing end cap on the return duct, but you 
should also seal the joints between the sections with duct tape. Also, a 
portion of the return duct in the crawl space should be insulated.

ON THE HOUSE: TREATING WATER SPOTS ON FIBERGLASS SURFACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MORRIS AND JAMES CAREY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: As a manufacturer of fiberglass and acrylic products, I was 
particularly interested in a column you did on removing hard-water spots from 
fiberglass or acrylic showers and bathtubs. I have had to deal with this 
cleaning problem frequently and recommend to you the following method: 
</P>
<P>
First, get 600-grit wet-or-dry sandpaper from any automotive body shop or parts 
store. Thoroughly wet down the entire surface with water and, using a circular 
motion, go over the affected area with just a few swipes. The mineral deposits 
will sand right off and go right down the drain. 
</P>
<P>
Caution: Do not overdo this process or you could sand right through the gel 
coat or color finish. The level of mineral deposits contained in one's water 
will vary from community to community, so some fixtures may require more elbow 
grease than others. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have removed all of the hard-water or mineral deposits, go over the 
complete unit with an auto-body paste wax. This will result in a new car-like 
finish, which will help to resist future mineral build-up in the shower or 
bathtub. It works every time! 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: We have seen 600-grit wet-or-dry sandpaper used successfully on 
porcelain or china fixtures in the home, but have yet to use it on fiberglass 
or acrylic fixtures. We suppose that if it is used sparingly and in accordance 
with your instructions that it will do just what you suggest. 
</P>
<P>
We appreciate your information and welcome any of our readers who should elect 
to attempt this procedure to share their results with us. We are curious to 
know how this works for you.

<P>
Treating Drawers to Prevent Scratching 
</P>
<P>
Q: Recently, we remodeled our kitchen, and to expedite matters, I worked with 
the carpenters and did the painting of the cabinets, shelves and drawers as 
they were finished. 
</P>
<P>
I have always hated the insides of drawers and tops of shelves, which soon 
became discolored and scratched by the items put on them. My special gripe was 
pans, which really made a mess. The unfinished surface is so hard to keep 
clean. I have not seen this solution to finishing drawers and cabinet shelves 
in the kitchen used before, but we tried it much to our delight. 
</P>
<P>
I gave each shelf (top only) and the inside of each drawer three coats of 
polyurethane with plenty of time to dry between coats. 
</P>
<P>
Now, about eight months later, I can say that this was a great success. Not one 
discoloration from pots, pans or cans anywhere. It may be more work to put on 
three coats, but it pays off in improved appearance, not to mention ease of 
cleanup. And, the best part is, no more shelf paper. 
</P>
<P>
Thought that you might be interested in sharing my experience with your 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
A: Thanks. Your adventure prompted us to call the folks at the Flecto Co. in 
Oakland, a leading manufacturer of clear wood-finishing products. 
</P>
<P>
Our concern was relative to any potential problems or health hazards that may 
be attached to the technique that you are suggesting. And, as a result, we have 
some good news for you. 
</P>
<P>
The Flecto Co. applauds your efforts and is especially pleased that you opted 
to use three complete coats. They say that this will significantly improve the 
longevity of the finish and will provide you with a surface that is not only 
impervious to liquids, but will stand up to the kind of abuse that kitchen 
cabinet shelves and drawers are likely to sustain. 
</P>
<P>
One caution: Allow the final coat to air dry at least 72 hours or until most of 
the unpleasant odor associated with the use of this type of product has 
dissipated.

EQUITY SHARING ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article by Robert J. Bruss, "Home Equity Sharing Benefits Owner, Renter" 
(Feb. 25), was excellent, with one notable exception: the negative statement 
about the problem arising when the resident co-owner stops making the monthly 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
In the real estate investors program, we call the co-owners the "buyer" and 
"investor." 
</P>
<P>
The buyers start with no equity and earn their 50% share of the equity increase 
over five years or 60 payments. If they default or have to move before five 
years, their share is prorated. Therefore, even in a default the buyers don't 
lose everything. 
</P>
<P>
We establish an open holding escrow to collect the monthly payments including a 
requirement of depositing one month payment in advance. The holding escrow also 
retains a signed grant deed from the buyer to the investor. If a problem is 
developing, the escrow officer will know one month before that payment is due.

THE SMALL INVESTOR: APARTMENT SELLER ASKS ABOUT TAX EXEMPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Robert J. Bruss is a San Francisco-area lawyer, author and 
real estate broker.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: About 12 years ago, I inherited a four-unit apartment building where 
I live in a two-bedroom unit. 
</P>
<P>
My nephew and his wife have made me a very good offer to buy the building at a 
price that will give me over $200,000 profit. The question is can I use that 
$125,000 old folks tax exemption you often write about? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Yes and no. You appear to qualify for the "over 55 rule" $125,000 home 
sale tax exemption, as to the profit on the sale of your personal residence 
apartment. However, this tax break does not apply to your profit on the three 
rental apartments. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the $125,000 home sale exemption you must be 55 or older on the 
day of sale, have owned and lived in your principal residence any three of the 
five years before sale and must never have used this tax break of Internal 
Revenue Code 121 before. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you live in the best and largest apartment, you can probably 
allocate more than one-fourth of the sales price and profit to your personal 
residence unit. Perhaps $80,000 of that $200,000 profit can be attributed to 
your apartment and the remaining $120,000 profit applies to the other three 
units. 
</P>
<P>
Using your $125,000 exemption it will shelter $80,000 of profit from taxation, 
but you will owe tax on the remaining $120,000 profit. Incidentally, you cannot 
save the unused $45,000 of your exemption in this example for future use. 
Please consult your tax adviser for more details. 
</P>
<P>
Rental Houses a Good Way to Beat Inflation 
</P>
<P>
Q: We own our home, which has proven to be a great investment as well as a good 
place to live. Since our home has done so well, we're thinking of buying one or 
two rental houses. Do you think they would be good inflation hedges? 
</P>
<P>
A: Although many real estate markets are stagnant now, over the long term, real 
estate market values usually keep pace with or exceed the inflation rate. If 
the annual inflation rate stays around 5%, in 10 years property values will 
need to increase 50% just to stay even with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
But you can do better if you use leverage to maximize your profit per dollar 
invested. To illustrate, suppose you make a $10,000 down payment to buy a 
$100,000 house that appreciates just 5% in market value during the next year. 
That $5,000 increased value is a 50% return on your $10,000 leveraged 
investment. Yes, I think rental houses can be great inflation hedges. 
</P>
<P>
Leasing Your Home and Renting Can Pay 
</P>
<P>
Q: I was fascinated by the recent question and answer in your column about 
renting out your personal residence and moving into a rental house. My CPA 
fully agrees it makes sense from a tax viewpoint. But my wife won't accept the 
idea of living in a home we don't own. However, we agreed to think about this 
concept and possibly move into a rental house next June after school is out. 
Are there any precautions to take? 
</P>
<P>
A: For readers who haven't the slightest idea what we are discussing, 
previously another reader wrote about the concept she heard about moving to a 
rental house and renting her residence to tenants. I agreed it was a wise thing 
to do, considering the income tax advantages. 
</P>
<P>
By moving out of your home, you can rent it to tenants and depreciate the lower 
of its adjusted cost basis or market value on the day of conversion to rental 
status. This will probably result in a negative cash flow and a tax loss that 
you can deduct from your ordinary taxable income such as job salary, interest 
and dividends. 
</P>
<P>
Renting a similar nearby home should be far cheaper than owning it. In fact, 
you may be able to rent a luxury home which you couldn't afford to buy. 
</P>
<P>
Precautions to take include obtaining as long a lease as possible, preferably 
two to five years, insisting on a renewal option so you won't be forced to move 
out at the end of your lease, requiring a clause in the lease limiting the 
maximum rent increase and if possible, obtaining an option to purchase the 
rental house. Please consult a real estate attorney for further details. 
</P>
<P>
Property Seller Liable for Misrepresentation 
</P>
<P>
Q: I got swindled but am not sure what to do about it. Two months ago, I bought 
my first income property, a 12-unit apartment building. The realty agent told 
me all the tenants were on month-to-month rentals. Since the rents were very 
low I had planned to immediately raise the rents. 
</P>
<P>
But when I gave the tenants their rent raise notices, they all surprised me by 
showing me their new leases, which they signed with the seller just a few days 
before the close of the sale. I had carefully insisted on receiving copies of 
the current rental agreements, but I was shown only month-to-month tenancies. 
The seller has left the state. Can I hold the realty agent liable for my 
damages? 
</P>
<P>
A: The primary responsibility for the fraudulent misrepresentation falls on the 
seller for signing those sweetheart leases with the tenants just a few days 
before the sale closed. However, it is arguable that the realty agent, as agent 
for the seller, also had responsibility to deliver to you what was represented 
to you when you saw those month-to-month leases. Since the seller is now beyond 
your reach, that leaves the realty agent to answer for your loss. Consult a 
real estate attorney for details. 
</P>
<P>
'Magic' of Leverage in Buying Property 
</P>
<P>
Q: I can't see why you encourage people to invest in rental houses, apartments 
and commercial buildings since they usually produce little or no positive cash 
flow. Although I can only earn 8% to 9% on my money at the bank, it seems to me 
this is better than no return at all. Please clarify. 
</P>
<P>
A: I agree it is foolish to invest in real estate for the cash flow because few 
properties provide much cash flow without a large cash down payment. 
</P>
<P>
Investors often buy income properties for the tax losses, primarily from 
depreciation tax shelter (now limited to $25,000 deductible against ordinary 
income), potential for appreciation in market value, safety of investment and 
the "magic" of leverage. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, suppose you buy a break-even cash-flow $100,000 income property 
with a $10,000 cash down payment and $90,000 in mortgages. If this building 
appreciates just 5% in market value in the next 12 months, that $5,000 value 
increase is a 50% return on your $10,000 investment. In addition, you would get 
tax benefits. Now I hope you see why investors buy leveraged real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Tax-Delinquent Lots Are Rarely a Bargain 
</P>
<P>
Q: I notice the newspaper occasionally carries legal notices of tax-delinquent 
property sales. I looked over the list of properties and found most were odd 
vacant lots. Do you think tax-delinquent properties are bargains? 
</P>
<P>
A: Although there are occasional exceptions, my experience and that of many 
other investors I know has been that very few bargains are available at tax 
delinquent property sales. 
</P>
<P>
My suggestion is to go over the list of advertised properties to be sold at the 
tax sale. If you find one that looks interesting, contact the owner and try to 
buy the property before the sale from the owner. Then pay the delinquent tax so 
the property won't be sold at the auction. 
</P>
<P>
Some Risks of Buying Nonconforming Use 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own several small neighborhood grocery stores. My stores charge higher 
prices than supermarkets, but are more convenient and offer special services, 
such as payroll check cashing. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, I was offered a grocery store in a top neighborhood. The reason it is 
for sale is that the owner is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
But the problem is the store is a nonconforming use surrounded by very fine 
homes. The price is right. Do you think I should buy? 
</P>
<P>
A: Please be careful. Investigate thoroughly. Find out the conditions on the 
nonconforming use. 
</P>
<P>
If the building is destroyed by fire, for example, most nonconforming uses do 
not allow reconstruction. Or there may be a time limit by which the property 
use must conform with the surrounding residential properties. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you are a gambler and are willing to risk that you can earn back 
your investment before the nonconforming use ends, then you may wish to go 
ahead with the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
No Profit Tax Due on Bargain Purchase 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently bought a vacant lot at a bargain price at least $25,000 below 
market value because the seller was about to lose it in a foreclosure sale. I 
plan to construct a building on the lot. Do I owe any tax now on the difference 
between what I paid for the lot and its market value? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. If the seller earned any profit, the seller owes tax on the sale. But 
you don't owe tax on your bargain purchase. However, when you eventually sell 
the property you will have a low basis for the lot and the result will be a 
higher profit than if you had paid market value for the property. Please 
consult your tax adviser for further details. 
</P>
<P>
How Starker- Delayed Exchanges Work 
</P>
<P>
Q: In a recent article about tax-deferred exchanges, you briefly mentioned 
Starker delayed exchanges. But I didn't understand the explanation of having 45 
days to locate another property and 180 days to close the purchase. Last year I 
moved away from Washington, D.C., where I own an apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
It is being mismanaged by a management company, which now has several vacancies 
in the building where I rarely had any vacancies when I managed it. Perhaps I 
could use a Starker delayed exchange to sell my Washington apartments and then 
use the sale proceeds to acquire investment property close to my new home. 
Please clarify how Starker exchanges work. 
</P>
<P>
A: A Starker delayed exchange, authorized by Internal Revenue Code 1031(a)(3), 
is perfect for your situation. The first step is to list your apartments for 
sale with a Washington real estate agent experienced in selling that type of 
property. While the property is being marketed, contact a real estate attorney 
or other third-party intermediary who is experienced with Starker delayed 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
When an acceptable purchase offer is obtained, the offer can be accepted 
subject to making a tax-deferred exchange. Your exchange adviser can give you 
the details. After the sale of your apartments closes, the sale proceeds must 
be held by a third party. 
</P>
<P>
Your next step is to designate within 45 days after the sale closing one or 
more properties you want to acquire with the sale proceeds to complete the 
trade. Remember, to qualify for a tax-deferred exchange, you must trade up to 
more valuable "like kind" property without receiving any taxable unlike kind 
personal property "boot" such as cash or net mortgage relief. 
</P>
<P>
Examples of like kind property you can acquire include one or more apartment 
buildings, warehouses, office buildings, commercial properties, rental houses 
and vacant land. However, a personal residence and dealer property are 
ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
After designating one or more properties to be acquired, you have 180 days from 
the sale date of your apartment building to complete acquisition of the 
property you will be receiving. During this 180-day period you must complete 
the purchase negotiations, arrange financing and acquire the title. The happy 
result will be tax deferral on your sale profit and acquisition of investment 
property close to your new home.

BROKERS, AUCTIONEERS IN BID FOR RTC BUSINESS; 
</P>
<P>
PROPERTY: COMPETITION IS KEEN TO GET SOME OF THE BUSINESS OF SELLING THOUSANDS 
OF ASSETS OF DEFUNCT S&amp;LS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON GALPERIN, Galperin is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer who has 
covered the commercial real estate scene for several years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bidding war has started. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate brokers nationwide are teaming up with auctioneers to offer sellers 
one more incentive for signing with them. And real estate auctioneers are 
trying to take their image beyond the courthouse steps by planning more upscale 
sales to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody wants to claim a part of the more than 30,000 properties that are to 
be sold through the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency charged with liquidating 
assets of defunct thrift institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers are staggering. Properties for sale on the RTC's latest list fill 
3,000 pages in nearly four volumes. 
</P>
<P>
And there's something for everyone: A country club with no golf course, a 
shopping center with no street access and Texas condos without air 
conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
Serious buyers, however, may have an unparalleled opportunity to benefit where 
others have lost. 
</P>
<P>
Auctions play a big part in the RTC plans to get all these properties off its 
books and back in the private sector. That's where brokers and auctioneers see 
an opportunity for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate brokers such as Grubb &amp; Ellis, Cushman &amp; Wakefield and 
Coldwell Banker already have divisions set up to capitalize on the opportunity. 
Several other companies are studying the matter, and so is just about everyone 
else in the commercial scene. 
</P>
<P>
Grubb &amp; Ellis Co. is planning to launch its joint venture with auctioneer 
Ross Dove Co. by offering $100 million in properties at an auction set for late 
spring in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the companies' strategy is to persuade troubled lenders to let them 
sell their real estate portfolio before the feds move in and do it for them. At 
the same time, Grubb &amp; Ellis Asset Services is lobbying to become a major 
contractor for RTC property sales. 
</P>
<P>
California will prove especially fertile ground. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being the home to more than $4 billion in repossessed S&amp;L assets, 
California also has a large number of potential buyers. About 60% of distressed 
properties in Arizona, said Foster City-based auctioneer Ross Dove, are bought 
by Southern California investors. 
</P>
<P>
Grubb &amp; Ellis plans to assign each auction property to a broker and at the 
same time, try to market it conventionally. Since every auction generates 
thousands of inquiries, the company will turn those over to brokers, too -- 
creating a new pool of business prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that attracts bidders to auctions is the idea that they may get a 
bargain," said Robert C. Hildebran, president of Grubb &amp; Ellis Asset 
Services Co. in San Francisco. "The reality is that a buyer may bid more at 
auction than at the negotiation table. . . . Auctioneers will tell you that 
record prices are almost always set at auctions." 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing that makes a property more attractive to a buyer than the 
knowledge that someone else wants it too," reasoned Hildebran. "It creates a 
different psychological mind-set." 
</P>
<P>
It is through that mind-set that big-name brokers such as Grubb &amp; Ellis, 
Coldwell Banker and Cushman &amp; Wakefield hope to open up for themselves an 
altogether new market. Said Hildebran: "I see no reason why in 1991 we couldn't 
be closing $1 billion in auction sales." 
</P>
<P>
"Real estate auctions are coming out of the Dark Ages," claimed Earl Reiss, 
executive vice president at Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc. in New York.

<P>
Last year, his company teamed up with auctioneer Christie's for a one-half hour 
sale of more than $40 million in properties offered by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Interested buyers had to front a $250 deposit for information on each property 
and a 10% percent cashier's check or letter of credit on any property they 
wanted to bid on. Buyers had another 60 days to pay the balance or lose their 
deposit. 
</P>
<P>
Such high-brow ground rules, Reiss said, helped keep out the "riffraff." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, real estate auctioneers want nothing more than to elevate their 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, they're perceived as an option of last resort. In contrast, 
art auctioneers are a generally respected lot, and usually the first stop for 
any serious seller. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy-Wilson Inc. of Santa Monica sponsors about 20 real estate auctions a 
year and predicts an even busier future. 
</P>
<P>
"Conventional sales will still be a big part of the RTC program," said Holly 
Burgin, senior vice president at Kennedy-Wilson. But for many properties, 
auctions will be the only way to go. 
</P>
<P>
The key to a successful auction is offering buyers a discount of what they 
would likely pay buying the same property through a brokerage. "If buyers don't 
perceive a bargain, they won't come," she said. "Buyers are pretty well 
educated and they know what value is." 
</P>
<P>
Generally, Burgin added, her company starts the bidding at 25% to 30% below 
what the auctioneer predicts will be the high bid. It's this strategy, she 
says, that has helped her win the business of First Interstate Bank, Bank of 
America, Security Pacific National Bank and the General Services 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
A growing interest in real estate auctions has also helped the company expand 
operations in Texas, Arizona, New Jersey and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Coldwell Banker also is planning to pursue more auctions nationwide. Instead of 
public auctions, however, Coldwell prefers to think in terms of sealed-bid 
auctions that provide buyers a bit more anonymity and allow for more 
behind-the-scenes maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
"Only a small number of buyers know how to deal with auctions," said James W. 
Field, manager of the company's Portfolio Disposition Services. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an old-line real estate type," he said. "I'm not convinced you maximize 
value at a public auction." 
</P>
<P>
Such activities also pose a problem of internal competition, Field said. "Our 
feeling right now is that Coldwell Banker shouldn't be in competition with its 
own brokers." 
</P>
<P>
And, while auctions may be particularly effective for condos and small 
commercial properties, Field said, complex purchases that require significant 
research by the buyer may not be at all suited to an auction. 
</P>
<P>
Auctions have the possibility of backfiring on a brokerage if the buyer 
realizes he or she has made a mistake. They'll be unlikely to return as 
Coldwell Banker clients. At auctions, Field said, the key is to "get people to 
bid before they can think." 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thinks auctions are fabulous and wants to jump onto the bandwagon," 
observes Mario Piatelli, a 40-year auctioneer with the Piatelli Co. in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thinks auctions are a cure-all for overpriced property," he said, 
but in reality, the RTC will have to offer some bargains if it expects to 
dispose of its massive portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
Piatelli's most recent auction at the Los Angeles Convention Center drew more 
than 5,000 potential bidders -- all of them looking to get a great deal. 
</P>
<P>
Piatelli also hopes to be among about a dozen major auction contractors 
selected by the RTC. His expectations, however, are tempered by years of 
experience on the auction circuit. 
</P>
<P>
The potential for profits is there, he said, "but it's a very tough business."

RENTERS ARE SPARED LOAD OF PAPER WORK TO FILL OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If your life does not permit ownership right now, you can draw some 
satisfaction from ease of renting. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, the standard paper 
work for moving into a rental unit includes two forms. 
</P>
<P>
The application to rent asks for your name, Social Security and driver's 
license numbers, address, reason for moving, phone number, references, previous 
addresses, names of anyone who will live with you and emergency information. 
</P>
<P>
Usually this serves as your credit application too, authorizing the landlord to 
inquire into your employment, bank accounts and credit history. The diligence 
with which this is checked varies widely among landlords. 
</P>
<P>
As long as they are not discriminating on the basis of race, sex, etc., 
landlords then have the right to pick a tenant based on credit history. Being 
the first to apply does not guarantee you an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Once your application has been approved, you will sign a month-to-month rental 
agreement or a lease. This spells out when your rental term begins, how much 
rent and security deposit you pay, when rent is due, what utilities or services 
are included, whether pets, water beds or musical instruments are permitted, 
and what happens if your rent is late. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords, on the other hand, are expected to document their actions a bit more 
rigorously. The association provides them with forms for notifying tenants of 
rent increases, intent to enter the unit, house rules, eviction, demand for 
rent or "performance" (meaning the tenant is breaking the rules and better 
shape up), and other things. The owner has about 30 forms in all to wield -- 
not all of which are needed for every rental. Eileen Heyes

THE PHILIPPINES AS REAL-LIFE SITCOM: DEALING WITH COUPS AND THEIR MAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Manila.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Watching events unfold in the Philippines is like watching a never-ending 
political sitcom. Last December a coup attempt left a lasting image of 
President Corazon Aquino besieged yet again by rightist rebels, while crowds 
hooted and cheered like basketball fans. "Surrender or die!" she said. But the 
rebels retreated, after signaling a timeout. A prominent opposition senator 
arrested for rebellion and murder becomes a star. Up north, a 
torturer-turned-renegade-leader runs circles around government troops. 
</P>
<P>
Much of this would be laughable if it weren't for the tragic consequences. And 
it shows Aquino's brand of leadership struggling to stay just ahead of anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest Feb. 27 of the leading opposition figure, Juan Ponce Enrile, on 
charges that he assisted the recent coup, should have been welcomed by a public 
long critical of Aquino's indecisiveness in times of crisis. But the way it was 
mishandled -- and Enrile's subsequent release on bail -- highlight the kind of 
muddling-through that best describes Aquino's four years in power. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't much so far to suggest that the president's emerging "get-tough" 
image is anchored on solid footing. Nor is it clear that Enrile's arrest forms 
part of a program to deal with the highly politicized, faction-ridden military 
once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino has faced six coup attempts by rightist elements, the last two the most 
serious. There could be more before her term ends in 1992. Rebel leader 
Gregorio (Gringo) Honasan and his cohorts remain at large, despite increased 
bounties for their capture. 
</P>
<P>
Even if she survives more plots to overthrow her, Aquino has a tough role to 
play, while wily, ambitious politicians like Enrile and her estranged cousin, 
Eduardo (Danding) Cojuangco, are ready to exploit her weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
Although Enrile's arrest has not, by itself, provoked yet another coup attempt, 
it triggered a bizarre sideshow in the north that resulted in the death of a 
popular general and several others. Rodolfo Aguinaldo, the suspended governor 
of Cagayan province, was also charged with aiding the attempted coup, but his 
refusal to submit to an arrest warrant led to an unnecessarily bloody 
shoot-out. 
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is full of cult figures like Aguinaldo who live on the fringes 
of the law. He was a military torturer under the late President Ferdinand E. 
Marcos and a warlord and folk hero to hundreds of poor and hungry followers. 
Until things got out of hand last week, Aguinaldo was allowed to defy both 
military and civilian authority for years. He threw in his support for the 
Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM) that helped depose Marcos. During the 
unsuccessful coup of August, 1987, he took over military headquarters at the 
provincial capital and flew the Philippine flag upside down. 
</P>
<P>
The brutal shooting of Brig. Gen. Oscar Florendo, the armed forces' principal 
spokesman, has helped turn public sentiment against characters like Aguinaldo. 
Last December there was public indifference, even sympathy, for rebel soldiers 
who were portrayed as "idealists" or "reformists." But Aquino's government 
hardly benefits if rogues like Aguinaldo can roam about freely. 
</P>
<P>
Jailing Enrile, the sole opposition senator, was the first such move against 
any prominent personality accused by Aquino of supporting December's failed 
coup. Along with Enrile -- a patron of the fugitive Honasan and of the "RAM 
boys," as the military rebels are known -- Aquino has also named Vice President 
Salvador Laurel and Cojuangco for possible complicity in the rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a show of strength, but it could be a sign of weakness," said one Western 
diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Two days earlier, Aquino marked the fourth anniversary of the "People Power" 
uprising with an embittered attack against Enrile, who earlier "apologized" to 
the Filipino people for having helped put Aquino in power. The unforgiving 
president, speaking in colloquial Filipino, harangued Enrile for "revising" 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Until a Supreme Court ruling last week, Enrile was detained without bail under 
a charge of rebellion with murder, although a 1956 Supreme Court ruling held 
that the two offenses cannot be incorporated into one. If found guilty, Enrile 
could face life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
A former investigating officer recommended to state prosecutors that Enrile be 
charged with the lesser offense of "disloyalty in times of peace," since it 
would be easier to prove. This is a bailable offense, punishable by up to 10 
years' imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
The charge sheets against Enrile so far are based largely on testimony by 
waiters who say that Enrile entertained Honasan and about 100 rebels at his 
residence on the first day of the coup. 
</P>
<P>
If the aim of strategists in Malacanang, the presidential palace, was to 
humiliate Enrile, it obviously backfired. The former defense minister basks in 
the limelight of publicity. His arrest on the floor of the Senate left the 
skillful lawyer-politician ample room for grandstanding. He gave an emotional 
"farewell speech" to his colleagues while the arresting officer waited outside. 
He held press conferences. His custodians made the further mistake of giving 
him VIP treatment with amenities -- unrestricted visitors and access to media, 
including a live telephone hook-up with a TV talk show. 
</P>
<P>
Enrile could parlay all this into a presidential candidacy for 1992, if he is 
cleared of charges. Though he was defense minister and the hated martial-law 
administrator under Marcos, people here have short memories and tend to forgive 
a man when he's down, or when he treats his friends well. On his birthday last 
Feb. 14, Enrile gave a huge "coup" theme party with hundreds of guest turning 
out in designer combat gear. 
</P>
<P>
Another contender for the 1992 race could be Aquino's estranged vice president, 
Laurel. The president has said Laurel is under investigation in connection with 
the failed coup, but the government may move more cautiously in his case. He 
was out of the country at the time, and the government would be loath to allow 
him the kind of podium that Enrile's arrest has provided. Manila pundits regard 
Laurel as a political lightweight. 
</P>
<P>
Cojuangco is potentially the most formidable dark horse, but he remains tainted 
as a Marcos loyalist and crony capitalist. Aquino's government has charged that 
Cojuangco provided material and financial support to the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
If the government means what it says, it must continue to move against its 
perceived enemies. To ease up, to continue meting out the equivalent of 
push-ups as punishment for mutineers, only invites more of the same. 
Considering how close the last attempts came, the next one might well succeed.

SUNUNU VS. REILLY: MISSING THE STEAK, SEEING THE SIZZLE; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: FORGET THE HYPE, THE EPA CHIEF IS NOT BEING OUTMANEUVERED BY THE 
WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF. THEIR CLASH IS ONE OF JOB DESCRIPTIONS.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Washington pundit class loves tales of personality conflicts at senior 
levels. Speculating about who's knifing whom is more fun than addressing that 
annoyance, the issues. In this spirit, the recent, heavily hyped "clash" 
between White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) Administrator William K. Reilly has been, to columnists and the 
shout-show circuit, just what the doctor ordered. 
</P>
<P>
After all, there are several important environmental regulations in the works 
and they are, well, complicated. Proposed ecological legislation is so full of 
statistics, technical terms, mathematical formulas -- you would practically 
have to read the stuff to have an opinion (unless you're booked on "The 
McLaughlin Group"). A clash of presidential advisers, on the other hand: What 
could make more fertile fields for instant punditry? 
</P>
<P>
According to the conventional wisdom, Sununu is insidiously taking over Bush 
Administration environmental policy, hanging Reilly out to dry. Supposedly, 
this is because Sununu is a tree-hating anti-environmental monster and he has 
true access to the President, while Reilly is just a show horse. Reflecting 
this, a score card on insider Washington recently labeled Sununu a "walking 
toxic-waste dump." Meanwhile the preferred insider's catty comment about Reilly 
is an oblique reference to "the male model." Reilly is photogenic -- can't say 
that of many policy types -- and dresses sharply. 
</P>
<P>
As is customary with conventional wisdom, the conventional wisdom about the 
Reilly-Sununu maneuvering is all wrong. First, though Sununu is to Reilly's 
political right, he has not sabotaged environmental policy. Second, Reilly has 
far more access to George Bush than is commonly understood -- partly through 
personal connections. Third, a year as EPA administrator is beginning to gray 
Reilly's hair (he is 50), which pretty much counts out any career as a model. 
</P>
<P>
The belief that Sununu is "sabotaging" environmental legislation stems from the 
pundit class's horror at the thought of actually having to ponder the details 
of environmental initiatives. Thus, when Bush recently gave a speech on global 
warming to a United Nations affiliate, pundits fixated on the fact that Sununu 
admitted rewriting portions of the text. 
</P>
<P>
The actual changes Sununu made were minor. He substituted "climate change" 
wherever "global warning" had appeared (some scientists consider the former 
phrase more precise) and struck out as premature a Reilly-backed call for 
consideration of a tax on emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse 
gas. (Note to environmentalists: A carbon-dioxide tax would discourage use of 
fossil fuels and be a huge boost to nuclear power.) 
</P>
<P>
But accounts of Sununu's rewrite barely mentioned the substance of the changes. 
They focused on the style aspects of one senior presidential adviser overruling 
another, and whether Reilly's star was declining. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of the speech hoo-ha also skipped over the fact that Sununu did not 
challenge the idea that global warming is a serious prospect -- that would have 
been true sabotage. Instead, Sununu objected to the notion that warming has 
been detected -- which many scientists challenge, too. Similarly, when Sununu 
intervened last month to insert a loophole into some new wetlands regulations, 
the loophole got all the play; overlooked was that Sununu endorsed the 
regulations, which are going to make development of billions of U.S. acres far 
more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as a few months ago, conventional wisdom was quite impressed that 
Reilly was a frequent visitor to the White House. In his first six months on 
the job he went there more than all previous EPA administrators combined. 
Reilly has been an animated participant in meetings of the Domestic Policy 
Council, despite not being a Cabinet secretary -- that's slated to change as 
EPA is elevated to a Cabinet status -- and he frequently lobbied Bush in person 
for environmental rules. After Sununu asserted himself, however, suddenly 
Reilly's access was declared all show. 
</P>
<P>
A key missed clue: Reilly sees the President socially. Reilly and his wife have 
been guests at state dinners, gone to the theater with the Bushes and so on. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly is on social terms with Bush partly because of a real-estate 
coincidence. After leaving the U.S. Senate in the early 1960s, Prescott Bush, 
the President's father, bought a house in Hobe Sound, Fla., a fashionable 
address north of Palm Beach. Near the Bush house was a home owned by Russell E. 
Train, a GOP Establishment figure and, until Reilly's selection, the only 
professional conservationist ever to head the EPA. The Bush and Train families 
became socially close; Train supported Bush in many campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Train was Reilly's mentor, the two worked together on many environmental 
projects -- including the World Wildlife Fund. Reilly came to know Bush through 
Train, and when Bush asked Train's advice on who to pick for EPA, Train pushed 
for Reilly. The two hit it off -- that Reilly was a Yalie like Bush didn't 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's political quandary on the environment is that he must satisfy three 
constituencies: old-line Establishment Republicans of his father's cut, who are 
pro-conservation either through personal conviction or elitism; new-money 
pro-development Republicans, who are no longer reflexively anti-environment but 
won't abide any disruption of growth, and the general voting public, which, in 
1992, may well judge Bush on whether his 1988 environmental promises are 
carried out. 
</P>
<P>
The status of the new Clean Air Act, the most important environmental 
initiative in 10 years, is a gauge of how the politics of environmentalism are 
shaking out in the new Administration. The new act is designed to reduce urban 
smog, acid rain and toxic air emissions from factories dramatically . 
</P>
<P>
At the very time the Washington press was going loopers over Sununu's tinkering 
with the global-warming speech, Reilly, White House Domestic Policy Adviser 
Roger B. Porter and Office of Management and Budget officer Robert E. Grady 
were engaged in extended negotiations aimed at heading off a potential collapse 
of the new Clean Air Act in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
There is already a version of the new act more or less finished in the House; 
Bush and most House environmentalists are on record as basically accepting it. 
The Senate bill, however, contained a number of provisions that White House 
analysts felt would lead to substantial consumer price increases but only 
infinitesimal ecological gains -- mainly in categories where a large amount of 
pollution could be wiped out for an affordable price, but the final few 
percentage points might cost an arm and a leg. 
</P>
<P>
For example, new cars emit only about 4% as much pollution as cars of 1970, 
when national emissions control began. Under the new act that figure will drop 
to about 2%, for a reasonable cost. Environmentalists were pushing for a 
further reduction to under 1%, which Administration analysts believed would add 
half again as much to the $19-billion estimated cost. 
</P>
<P>
As the Senate version of the Clean Air Act grew more expensive, word began to 
circulate that Bush might veto it. Perversely, this prospect was attractive to 
Democrats. If "the environmental President" vetoed the most important piece of 
environmental legislation in a decade, Democrats would have a perfect issue for 
the 1992 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Then last week, in a rare fit of civic responsibility, senators reached 
agreement with Reilly and the rest of the Administration team on a version of 
the bill acceptable both to Bush and most liberals. 
</P>
<P>
Points of interest from the negotiations: 
</P>
<P>
Sununu didn't try to slip loopholes into the new bill. He has, in fact, favored 
several ecological advances. Sununu is convinced acid rain is for real. As 
governor of New Hampshire he backed state legislation requiring a 50% cut in 
industrial emissions of sulfur dioxide, the chief acid-rain precursor. That 
bill has since been copied by many states, and a roughly 50% reduction 
nationally is embodied in both versions of the Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
Both environmental and industry lobbyists have expressed outrage over the 
Senate compromise -- an indication that it does a good job of splitting the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu may continue to be painted as the heavy throughout the Bush 
Administration's environmental maneuverings. Because the President's chief of 
staff is a political operative, it is typical for him to be used in the bad-cop 
role or as a lightning rod on economic issues. (Remember Donald T. Regan?) 
Reilly is showing loyalty to his President by pressuring him to support 
dramatic environmental legislation: If Bush doesn't come through here, on one 
of his few specific campaign promises, there could be hell to pay in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever else Sununu is, he is a political animal who understands this 
equation. "Sabotaging" environmental reform would only sabotage Bush's chances 
for reelection, and Sununu is not that stupid.

THE BEST U.S. FOREIGN POLICY BEGINS AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

and Reagan, is a syndicated columnist and CNN commentator.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was to "create a more perfect Union" that the great men came to 
Philadelphia; it was to permit the republic to grow to its natural size that 
James K. Polk seized Texas and California; it was to preserve the Union -- not 
end slavery -- that Lincoln invaded and subjugated the Confederate states. 
</P>
<P>
"A republic if you can keep it," Benjamin Franklin told the lady in 
Philadelphia. Surely, preservation of the Republic, defense of its 
Constitution, living up to its ideals, that is our national purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Yet national purpose has become a vessel, emptied of original content, into 
which ideologues of all shades and hues are invited to pour their own causes, 
their own visions. 
</P>
<P>
In Charles Krauthammer's "vision," the "wish and work" of our nation should be 
to "integrate" with Europe and Japan inside a "super-sovereign" entity that is 
"economically, culturally and politically hegemonic in the world." This "new 
universalism," he wrote for December's National Interest, "would require the 
conscious depreciation not only of American sovereignty but of the notion of 
sovereignty in general. This is not as outrageous as it sounds." 
</P>
<P>
While Krauthammer's superstate may set off orgiastic rejoicing inside the 
Trilateral Commission, it should set off alarm bells in more precincts than 
Belmont, Mass. As national purpose, or national interest, it fails the 
fundamental test: Americans will not fight for it. 
</P>
<P>
A nation's purpose is discovered not by consulting ideologies, but by reviewing 
its history, by searching the hearts of its people. What is it for which 
Americans have always been willing to fight? 
</P>
<P>
Well, let us go back to a time when the Establishment wanted war, but the 
American people did not want to fight. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall of 1941, Europe from the Pyrenees to Moscow, from the Arctic to 
North Africa, was ruled by Hitler's Third Reich; east of Moscow, Stalin's gulag 
extended across Asia to Manchuria, where it met the belligerent Empire of the 
Rising Sun. England was in her darkest hour. Yet, still, America wanted to stay 
out; we saw, in the world's bloody conflict, no cause why our soldiers should 
be sent overseas to spill a single drop of American blood. Pearl Harbor, not 
Franklin D. Roosevelt, made America to go to war. 
</P>
<P>
The isolationism of our fathers is today condemned, and F.D.R. is adjudged a 
great visionary, because he sought early involvement in Britain's war with 
Hitler. But even the interventionists' arguments were, and are, couched in 
terms of American national interest. 
</P>
<P>
For a century after George Washington's death, we resisted the siren's call of 
empire. Then, Kipling's call to "take up the white man's burden" fell upon the 
receptive ears of President William McKinley, who came down from a sleepless 
night of consulting the Almighty to tell the press: "God told me to take the 
Philippines." We were launched. 
</P>
<P>
Two decades later, 100,000 Americans lay dead in France in a European war 
begun, as Otto von Bismarck predicted it would begin, "because of some damn 
fool thing in the Balkans." 
</P>
<P>
"To make the world safe for democracy" we joined an alliance of empires -- 
British, French and Russian -- that held most of mankind in colonial captivity. 
Doughboys fell in places like the Argonne and Belleau Wood, in no small measure 
to vindicate the German-phobia and Anglophilia of a regnant Yankee elite. When 
the great "war to end all wars" had fertilized the seedbed that produced 
Mussolini, Hitler and Stalin, Americans, by 1941, had concluded a blunder had 
been made in ignoring the wise counsel of their Founding Father. 
</P>
<P>
After V-E Day and V-J Day, all America wanted to "bring the boys home," and we 
did. Then they were sent back, to Europe, to Asia, because Americans were 
persuaded that the Cold War must be waged, because Lenin's party had made the 
United States the "main enemy" in its war against the West. As the old saw 
goes, you can refuse almost any invitation, but when the man wants to fight, 
you've got to oblige him. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if the Cold War is ending, what are the terms of honorable peace that will 
permit us to go home? Withdrawal of the Red Army back within its own frontiers, 
liberation of Central Europe and the Baltic republics, reunification of Germany 
and the de-Leninizing of Moscow, i.e., overthrow of the imperialist party that 
has prosecuted the 70 Years' War against the West. 
</P>
<P>
The compensating concession we should offer is total withdrawal of U.S. troops 
from Europe. If Moscow will get out, we will get out. Once the Red Army goes 
home, the reason for keeping a U.S. Army in Europe vanishes. Forty years after 
the Marshall Plan, let Europe conscript the soldiers for its own defense. 
</P>
<P>
In 1956, at the high-water mark of the United States, America stood aside as 
Soviet tanks crushed the Hungarian revolution. With that decision, Dwight D. 
Eisenhower and John Foster Dulles told the world that, while we support freedom 
in Central Europe, America will not go to war over it. The year of revolution, 
1989, revealed the logical corollary: from Berlin to Bucharest to Beijing, as 
Lord Byron observed, "Who would be free, themselves must strike the blow." 
</P>
<P>
Would America be leaving our allies in the lurch? Hardly. The North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization contains 14 states which, together, are more populous and 
three times as wealthy as a Soviet Union deep in an economic, social and 
political crisis. Moreover, NATO would have a new buffer zone of free, neutral, 
anti-communist nations between the Soviet and German frontiers. Our job will 
have been done. 
</P>
<P>
A united Germany is consistent with our values, our promise to the German 
people -- and their national interest; Germans desire it and will attain it. 
"Conditions" set down by the United States will prove as ineffectual as they 
are insulting. 
</P>
<P>
A free, united Germany in the heart of Europe, inoculated against Marxism by 45 
years of the disease, would be a triumph of U.S. policy, a pillar of capitalism 
and the first line of defense against a resurgent Russian imperialism. For the 
United States to permit itself to be used by London, Paris and Moscow to impede 
reunification is to re-enact, 70 years later, the folly of Versailles. Deny 
Germans the unity they rightly seek and we shall awake one morning to find the 
Russians have granted it. 
</P>
<P>
But disengagement does not mean disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
Still the greatest trading nation on earth, the United States depends on 
freedom of the seas for prosperity. The strength of the U.S. Navy should be 
non-negotiable; and when the President is invited to enter naval arms-control 
negotiations, the answer should be no, even if Moscow walks out. 
</P>
<P>
With the acquisition of ballistic missiles by China, Iran, Iraq, Syria and 
Libya, with nuclear weapons work being done in half a dozen countries of the 
Third World, the United States needs, nay, requires, a crash research and 
development program for missile defense; no arms-control agreement is worth 
trading away the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
An island continent, America should use economic and technological superiority 
to keep herself permanent mistress of the seas, first in air power, first in 
space. Nor is the cost beyond our capacity; it is not warships and weapons that 
consume half our defense budget; it is manpower and benefits. When defense cuts 
are made, they should come in army bases no longer needed for homeland defense 
and ground troops no longer needed on foreign soil. 
</P>
<P>
As U.S. bases close in Europe, we should inform Moscow we want all Soviet 
troops out of the Western hemisphere. They have no business here. This is our 
hemisphere; and the Monroe Doctrine should be made again the cornerstone of 
U.S. foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
We should also move our troops off the mainland of Asia. South Korea has twice 
the population, five times the economic might of North Korea. We are not going 
to fight another land war in Asia. No vital interest justifies it; our people 
will not permit it. It is time we began uprooting the global network of 
"tripwires" planted on foreign soil, to ensnare the United States in the wars 
of other nations, to back commitments made before this generation of American 
soldiers was even born. 
</P>
<P>
The late Barbara Tuchman wrote that Kaiser Wilhelm could not stand it if, 
somewhere in the world, a quarrel was going on and he was not a party to it. 
Blessed by providence with pacific neighbors, north and south, and vast oceans, 
east and west, to protect us, why seek permanent entanglement in other people's 
quarrels? 
</P>
<P>
As we ascend the staircase to the 21st Century, America is uniquely situated to 
lead the world. 
</P>
<P>
Japan has a population older and not half so large as ours; her land and 
resources cannot match California's. Even a united Germany would have but a 
third of our population, a fifth of our gross national product and a land area 
smaller than Oregon and Washington. While the Soviet Union has the size, 
resources and population to challenge as a world power, she is a prison house 
of nations whose ethnic hatreds and unworkable system mean a decade of turmoil. 
The corrupt, bankrupt China of Deng Xiaoping will not survive the decade. 
Yasuhiro Nakasone was right: The 20th Century was the American century. The 
21st will be the American century as well. 
</P>
<P>
But America can lead the world into the 21st Century only if it is not saddled 
down by baggage piled up in the 20th. 
</P>
<P>
For 50 years, the United States has been drained of wealth and power by wars, 
cold and hot. Much of that expenditure of blood and treasure was a necessary 
investment. Much was not. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot forever defend wealthy nations that refuse to defend themselves; we 
cannot permit endless transfusions of the lifeblood of American capitalism into 
the mendicant countries and economic corpses of socialism without bleeding 
ourselves to death. Foreign aid is an idea whose time has passed. The communist 
and socialist world now owe the West $1,000 billion and more, exclusive of 
hundreds of billions we simply gave away. Our going-away gift to the globalist 
ideologues should be to tell the Third World we are not sending the gunboats to 
collect our debts, neither are we sending more money. The children are on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Americans are the most generous people in history. But our altruism has been 
exploited by the guilt-and-pity crowd. At home, a monstrous welfare state of 
tens of thousands of drones and millions of dependents consumes huge slices of 
national income. 
</P>
<P>
We should look, too, with a cold eye on the internationalist set, never at a 
loss for new ideas to divert U.S. wealth and power into crusades and causes 
having little or nothing to do with the true national interest of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
High among these is the democratist temptation, the worship of democracy as a 
form of government and the concomitant ambition to see all mankind embrace it. 
Like all idolatries, democratism substitutes a false god for the real, a love 
of process for a love of country. 
</P>
<P>
When we call a country "democratic," we say nothing about whether its rulers 
are wise or good, or friendly or hostile; we only describe how they were 
chosen. 
</P>
<P>
How other people rule themselves is their own business. To call it a vital 
interest of the United States is to contradict history and common sense. For 
the Republic to seek to dictate to 160 nations what kind of regime each should 
have is a formula for interminable meddling and endless conflict; it is a 
textbook example of that "messianic globaloney" against which Dean Acheson 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
"We must consider first and last," Walter Lippmann wrote in 1943, "the American 
national interest. If we do not, if we construct our foreign policy on some 
kind of abstract theory of rights and duties, we shall build castles in the 
air. We shall formulate policies which in fact the nation will not support with 
its blood, its sweat and its tears." Exactly. 
</P>
<P>
"Enlightened nationalism" was Lippmann's idea of a foreign policy to protect 
America's true national interest. What we need is a new nationalism, a new 
patriotism, a new foreign policy that puts America first -- and not only first, 
but second and third as well.

THE WEST GERMAN WHO WOULD BE THE WORLD'S NEXT PAUL VOLCKER

BONN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is time for Americans to get to know Karl Otto Poehl, president of West 
Germany's Central Bank. As Bonn and Berlin rush to reunify, Poehl will oversee 
his country's economic and monetary union. When a reunified and economically 
dominant Germany emerges, Poehl will seal his place as the Continent's top 
central banker. 
</P>
<P>
Poehl is no mere foreign technician operating 8,000 miles away and providing 
statistical fodder for economic pundits. He's an economic force to be reckoned 
with, someone whose clout rivals that wielded by Japan, Inc.'s managers. Poehl 
is added proof that the international economy is no longer an annex of the 
United States, but one operating outside the control of any single country. 
America must adapt or suffer the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Central bankers are a mysterious lot -- high priests of capitalism whose 
magical mutterings only the initiated can divine. In world central banking, the 
cardinal gets to be Pope-like -- not all powerful, but a global figure. 
National monetary politics are intertwined; what happens to interest rates in 
West Germany and Japan affects what happens to them in the United States, and 
vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the '80s, Paul A. Volcker was the dominant force in central 
banking. When he stepped down as Federal Reserve chairman in July, 1987, his 
successor, Alan Greenspan, took the throne, recognized by his peers, and with 
the approval of the world's investors. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Greenspan's influence shrinks, while Poehl's grows. As a result, 
the president of West Germany's central bank is the Pope-apparent. 
</P>
<P>
Working out of an office on the outskirts of Frankfurt, Poehl was appointed 
vice president of the Bundesbank in 1977, becoming its president three years 
later. His second eight-year term will not end until 1995, when he will be 66. 
</P>
<P>
Poehl is protected, by law, from Bonn's meddlesome politicians. Greenspan 
enjoys similar protection, but there are noises on Capitol Hill about clipping 
the Fed's wings. (Japan's central banker can never be Pope; he has to do what 
the Ministry of Finance tells him to.) Thus Poehl appears more securely 
independent -- the first criterion of being central-banking Pope. 
</P>
<P>
Poehl is also gaining control over more and more of the world's money. Before 
1991, he is likely to be dictating monetary policy in East and West Germany. By 
next year, he may be ruling the money flow in Eastern Europe. As the Soviets 
retreat from Eastern Europe, so goes the ruble. As East Bloc nations distance 
themselves from the Soviet currency, the obvious replacement is East Europe's 
reserve currency -- the deutsche mark. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Poehl's central-banking star is rising ever higher because more and 
more of the world's investors take their cues from him. The currency he manages 
is riding high, gaining roughly 6.5% on the dollar, 25% on the yen since last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But Poehl has another advantage: He attracts attention through the sheer force 
of personality. Rascally, politically shrewd, a lover of good gossip, fine wine 
and fast ski slopes who can hold his own in serious intellectual debate, Poehl, 
like Volcker in the '80s, is a contradiction in terms -- a charismatic central 
banker. 
</P>
<P>
Germany's reunification poses problems for the Bundesbank, as investors assess 
what it will mean for West German stocks and bonds. Frankfurt financial markets 
are already in turmoil. But one theory holds that as East Germany and Europe 
are reconfigured, Poehl will be shaping events, not submitting to them. 
</P>
<P>
Some Americans may pooh-pooh such prospects. Cold War warriors will continue to 
view the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and other dramatic political events as 
evidence for America's triumph rather than Poehl's ascendancy. Even so, 
distinctions between capitalist and communist -- eventually between industrial 
and developing -- economies will break down in the emerging era. The static 
economic hierarchies that jelled around the Cold War will dissolve into a 
kinetic system embroiled in an economic free-for-all. 
</P>
<P>
If the United States is to hold its own, it must do more than reduce its budget 
deficit, boost its savings or even gird for competition against Japan. Volcker 
and the days of the super-dollar are over. Now is the time to know Poehl -- and 
a lot more about the international economy.

It was with considerable amusement that I read your story regarding Mexico's 
production of marijuana (Part A, Feb. 25). 
</P>
<P>
I did some quick calculations (I had to do them longhand as my calculator ran 
out of space) and came up with a total U.S., Mexico and Colombia annual 
production of 124 million pounds, or approximately 2 billion ounces. That's 
enough marijuana to keep every man, woman, child, and dog north of the Mexican 
border in bliss well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Either drug czar William Bennett thinks we're all so doped up that we can't 
operate our calculators or he's got the whips and jingles so bad from tobacco 
withdrawal that he can't operate his.

INTELLECTS AND U.S. POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Hart's column ("Do Not Await a Messiah," Editorial Page, Feb. 17) is of 
significance for its emphasis on the nonpolitical and non-ideological aspects 
of the Central European revolution. These events foretell what American 
politics will be like in the coming decades as people learn more about and 
become impatient with the deception and corruption that permeate our political 
system. 
</P>
<P>
As Hart points out, "Can anyone imagine a political figure in either party who 
writes, or indeed could write, political essays -- let alone ones that are 
rich, poetic, philosophical meditations, searching the deeper meaning of 
experience." Is it conceivable that U.S. voters would ever elect a playwright 
like Vaclav Havel as president? 
</P>
<P>
And yet, this is exactly what we need in America: an honest confrontation with 
politicians to change their ways. No more phony political issues like Willie 
Horton or the American flag to deceive the people and obscure the issues. 
</P>
<P>
It is time that we in America learn a lesson from the Central European 
revolution and reject the rigid and stultifying ideologies that have no 
relevancy in the political and economic life of the American people.

INTELLECTS AND U.S. POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ronald Brownstein correctly points out that intellectuals and academics are 
rarely elected to political office (Column One, March 4). But their influence 
on the American scene is more pervasive than that observation suggests. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' Opinion section of the same date contained 19 columns. Bylines 
identified five of the columnists as current academics. Among the remainder, 
one was an historian, one a novelist, and one a former academic (Henry 
Kissinger, originally of Harvard!). That is, almost half of the individuals you 
selected to interpret the world to your readers were academics and 
intellectuals, not professional journalists. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has a long history of incubating academic ideas and eventually turning 
them into practice. Social Security was created in the 1930s out of the musings 
of John R. Commons and his students at the University of Wisconsin in the 
1920s. Deregulation in the 1970s owed much to Alfred Kahn (Cornell University). 
Even the now-infamous junk bonds of the 1980s have roots in writings on debt 
vs. equity by Nobelist Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller (then of Carnegie 
Tech) in the 1950s. The list is endless as is the potential for new ideas to 
influence American life, for better or worse.

WHY IS NORTH KOREA DIGGING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like moles who will not rest, North Korean construction battalions continued to 
dig, dig, dig their way into South Korea. For all anyone knows, they're at it 
still. 
</P>
<P>
South Korean military engineers have found another tunnel running beneath the 
155-mile-long demilitarized zone that divides their country and North Korea, 
the fourth to be discovered in the last 16 years. Seoul says satellite photos 
showing underground "axis lines" and other surface details point to the 
probable existence of another 20 or more tunnels. It's known that North Korean 
dictator Kim Il Sung ordered work begun on the project nearly 20 years ago. 
Construction noises led to the discovery of three tunnels in the 1970s. After 
that, North Korea invested heavily in Swedish excavators with noise-repressing 
equipment, and work continued apace. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnels so far found are anything but little shafts. Each is wide enough 
and high enough to allow soldiers to march three-abreast without stooping. The 
engineering difficulties involved -- the clandestine digging and disposal of 
great volumes of rock and dirt -- were clearly considerable. In some cases the 
tunnels burrow through solid granite; one runs as much as 490 feet beneath the 
surface. It's a safe guess the tunnels weren't built just to keep North Korea's 
troops out of the rain. Their only plausible purpose is to infiltrate commando 
units into rear areas, either to wage guerrilla warfare or to support a frontal 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and South Korea officials take the tunnels very seriously, and so they 
should. The two Koreas remain in the state of war that has existed ever since 
Communist North Korea invaded the south 40 years ago. The tunnels are clearly 
expensive, labor-intensive, time-consuming projects. That Kim was willing to 
invest a lot of scarce resources in them is visible proof that his old dreams 
of military conquest have not faded. It seems that, with all the changes going 
on in the Communist world, Kim Il Sung's North Korea is one place where time 
has stopped.

<P>
On Feb. 18, my wife and I drove Highway 395 north from San Bernardino to Carson 
City, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
Many of your readers, especially the skiers, will remember this as one of the 
days of the heavy storms. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to take this opportunity to publicly applaud the efforts of 
Caltrans during that weekend. This often maligned organization appeared to have 
worked all through Saturday night and into Sunday in order to keep the roads 
clear. Proof of their performance is the fact that we drove the entire distance 
without the need for tire chains.

SO DEPENDENT, SO POORLY CARED FOR

More bad news about the youngest users of the American health system: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Progress in reducing infant mortality has virtually halted as the United 
States has slipped to 20th place among the developed nations of the world, 
according to the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 -- None of the surgeon general's goals for 1990 for prenatal care and 
immunization have been met, says a joint report from the National Assn. of 
Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions and the American Academy of 
Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, matters have been getting worse: The proportion of young children 
without basic immunizations has increased; the percentage of women receiving 
delayed or no prenatal care has also increased. 
</P>
<P>
"These trends provide a strong indicator that infant mortality will worsen in 
the years ahead, especially as more communities feel the impact of increased 
poverty among children, drugs and fewer health care providers serving high-risk 
families," the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality warns. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly troubling is the "unconscionable gap" between white and black 
children. Compared with whites, black babies are twice as likely to die in 
their first year and three times more likely to have a birth weight under 3 1/4 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The findings are not surprising, given a situation in which children are 
one-third of the37 million Americans without health insurance. Half of the 
children living at poverty level have no insurance. 
</P>
<P>
And the prospects for improvement in child health in the future are dimmed by 
the fact that immunization is falling behind, protecting, for example, only 57% 
of non-whites from polio. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is there an easy solution. Some in Congress have responded to the 
commission report with proposals to extend Medicare coverage. California has 
already done this for pregnant mothers and infants, with the promise of 
improving prenatal care at least. But the Medicare system is so underfunded 
that it is, in any case, an inadequate response to a problem that probably can 
only be solved effectively by an as-yet undefined system of universal health 
care.

RULING ON AGENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What a way to start March, with the front-page article, "Court Slashes 
Constitutional Curbs on U.S. Agents Abroad" (March 1). It is amazing to see how 
our government has used its power to try and control the world. 
</P>
<P>
We start to see peace everywhere and what happens? Our judiciary guts our 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Is this how we want other countries to act? What do we do when foreign nations 
turn the tables on us? If the Constitution and its Bill of Rights were good 
enough for Jefferson, Madison, et al, what gives William Rehnquist, Antonin 
Scalia, and company (the current U.S. Supreme Court) the right to change it 
now? 
</P>
<P>
I find the recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court to be deplorable and 
can't believe that the people of this country find relief in the decisions our 
Supreme Court has been making. In my opinion, we need to rethink the competence 
of these people who are appointed to interpret the law for us. I do not support 
expanded freedom for the DEA and other federal agencies in other countries. We 
are not God and I detest our government thinking we are. 
</P>
<P>
It is amazing to me that as the builders of the Berlin Wall are dismantling it 
in favor of greater freedoms, the custodians of our own Wall of Freedom (the 
U.S. Constitution) are also dismantling it piece by piece, in favor of lesser 
freedoms.

Mongolia's opposition groups negotiated with the government Saturday on 
arrangements for a referendum to gauge public approval of the country's 
parliament, the Great Hural. 
</P>
<P>
The talks took place a day after an opposition hunger strike ended when 
Communist Party leaders agreed to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Damdindorj Ninj, who leads one of the four opposition groups pushing for a 
multi-party democracy, said he is confident that the country's leaders will 
follow through on their promises. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our victory," Ninj was quoted as saying. "I'm very hopeful the 
government will keep its promises." 
</P>
<P>
The leadership pledged Friday to hold an extra congress in April to change 
Communist Party rules and elect new party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
It also agreed to hold a referendum to give the people an opportunity to say 
whether they have confidence in the Great Hural. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said that both the opposition and the government will meet to draft a 
new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Ninj and 28 other protesters took part in a three-day hunger strike in 
Sukhbator Square in the center of the capital, Ulan Bator, to demand the 
resignations of President Jambyn Batmonh and the rest of the Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
Batmonh announced on television and radio Friday night that the entire 
Politburo will resign at a special plenum session Monday. 
</P>
<P>
National television also broadcast live talks between two ranking officials and 
representatives of the opposition groups Friday. 
</P>
<P>
When the news broke that the leadership would resign, the hunger strike ended. 
</P>
<P>
"People were hugging each other for joy and shouting hurray," one resident 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The hunger strike proved to be a very powerful weapon because Mongolians were 
horrified at the spectacle of the hunger strikers, who carried on despite 
subzero temperatures, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The streets of Ulan Bator were quiet Saturday, and workers called off a general 
strike.

KADAFI DESIGNATED SUPREME LEADER OVER ALL LIBYA

The General People's Congress ended an eight-day meeting by elevating Moammar 
Kadafi to the status of supreme leader, giving him wide-ranging authority to 
overrule virtually any decision with which he disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which ended Friday night, passed a law saying that Kadafi's role 
in the 1969 revolution gives him a legitimacy from which all the country's 
institutions derive their authority. 
</P>
<P>
"So instructions issued by the leader of the great revolution, brother Col. 
Moammar Kadafi, are binding, and it is a duty to carry them out," a declaration 
of revolutionary legitimacy said. 
</P>
<P>
Kadafi's new status is meant to clear up ambiguities over his role after he 
repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the political arena, leaving the system 
to run itself. 
</P>
<P>
But political observers said it remains unclear exactly what powers Kadafi has 
been imbued with. 
</P>
<P>
The General People's Congress failed, however, to resolve an acrimonious 
dispute between the executive branch and deputies over financing the welfare 
state, with neither side the clear winner.

Romania's major opposition parties demanded a delay in elections scheduled May 
20 to allow more time to challenge the post-revolutionary leadership, which has 
been attacked for its ties to the old regime. The demand represents the first 
time the fractious opposition has openly pooled its forces to stop the National 
Salvation Front's bid for long-term power. The National Peasant's Party and the 
National Liberal Party, the two largest opposition groups, joined forces with 
smaller parties in sending their demands to interim President Ion Iliescu.

T. H. BREM, 79; FORMER HEAD OF USC DEPT. OF MEDICINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Thomas Hamilton Brem, chairman of the department of medicine at the 
University of Southern California School of Medicine from 1958 to 1972, has 
died. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
Brem died Thursday of a heart seizure at Huntington Memorial Hospital in 
Pasadena four days after undergoing surgery for colon cancer, said USC 
spokesman Gordon Cohn. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom Brem was an absolutely outstanding human being and physician-teacher," 
said Dr. Jesse L. Steinfeld, former U.S. surgeon general. "He inspired 
integrity and loyalty in his faculty, students and other colleagues through his 
words and actions. He was the most influential teacher and physician in my 
career." 
</P>
<P>
Born Oct. 3, 1910, in the Panama Canal Zone, Brem grew up in Los Angeles and 
graduated from Fairfax High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in political 
science from Stanford University and his medical degree from Johns Hopkins 
University. 
</P>
<P>
After his residency at Stanford, Brem taught at USC and then served in the Army 
Medical Corps in the China-Burma-India theater during World War II. After 
teaching for a few years at UCLA, he returned to USC in 1954, becoming acting 
dean of the School of Medicine in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
In 1958, he was chosen head of the department of medicine and retained that 
position until his retirement in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
During those years, he often criticized efforts by the Board of Supervisors to 
ease overcrowding at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be very helpful but piddling," he rated one such push in 1970, 
"because the recommendations pay no attention to the gross inefficiencies and 
inadequacies which have plagued the hospital for years." 
</P>
<P>
Brem was a former chairman of the Special Medical Advisory Committee to the 
Veterans Administration, and former president of the Los Angeles Society of 
Internal Medicine and of the Los Angeles Academy of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Elizabeth Bloss Brem, and two sons, Tom 
Jr. and Stephen. A third son, Todd, was drowned two years ago in Brazil while 
serving as a Peace Corps volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service is planned for 2 p.m. Sunday, April 8, in the Oneonta 
Congregational Church, South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The family has asked that memorial contributions be made to the USC School of 
Medicine, KAM-700, 2025 Zonal Ave., Los Angeles, Calif., 90033.

THE RIGHTS THAT SOLD FOR $10 -- THE STRANGE TALE OF 'SOUTH OF HEAVEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everybody in Hollywood likes to boast about making a great deal. But one of the 
enduring unsolved mysteries of Jim Thompson's Hollywood years is how in 1970 
Tony Bill managed to buy the rights to Thompson's novel, "South of Heaven," for 
the astonishing sum of $10. 
</P>
<P>
The book, originally published in 1967, is now being made into a major motion 
picture, with producer Mark Lipson and the "Rain Man" production team of Barry 
Levinson and Mark Johnson at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
According to both Bill and the Thompson family, the rights to "South of Heaven" 
changed hands after Thompson met with Bill and Robert Redford and agreed to 
write an original script on an American hobo. What's in dispute is whether 
Thompson knowingly sold the rights or was bamboozled. 
</P>
<P>
"My father said he never recalled signing anything giving them any rights to 
that book," says his daughter, Sharon. "Maybe they got him drunk. He was not an 
idiot. He would have never sold the rights to any of his books for $10." 
</P>
<P>
Bill insists he has no recollection of purchasing the book. "I think Jim may 
have made a side deal with Columbia when we were making a deal for his hobo 
script," he says now. "But in tracing down the rights, 'South of Heaven' 
producer Mark Lipson determined that I originally owned the rights to it. But I 
have no recollection of that." 
</P>
<P>
Lipson says it took several years to track down the rights to the film. "I 
finally found a contract that said Thompson had sold 'South of Heaven' to Bill 
in 1970 when he and his partner, Vernon Zimmerman, ran a company called 
Bi-Plane Cinematograph," recalled Lipson, who was a producer of the acclaimed 
documentary, "The Thin Blue Line." 
</P>
<P>
"When I contacted Tony, he said, 'Why don't you just take the project -- the 
rights are all yours." 
</P>
<P>
Lipson subsequently discovered that Bill and Zimmerman had sold their rights to 
the book in 1972 to Columbia Pictures, which still owned the project. After 
several more years of negotiations, Lipson and director Ted Bafaloukos, with 
Levinson and Johnson's help, convinced Columbia to make the film. 
</P>
<P>
The Thompson family remains angry about the affair. "If my father thought he 
was among friends, he could've signed anything," said Sharon Thompson Reed. 
"But that doesn't mean he knew he was signing away the rights to his book. The 
family is extremely bitter about that incident. It was really the beginning of 
the end for my father." 
</P>
<P>
Blaine Campbell, the agent who represents the Thompson estate, insists he will 
take legal action if "South of Heaven" goes before the cameras this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"The Thompson family is not going to go quietly," he said. "It's unconscionable 
for Columbia to make a film without compensating the estate for the market 
value of the film. What's in dispute isn't the contract, but the ethics behind 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Is it possible Thompson could have sold the rights to one of his books for a 
paltry $10? "Jim once tried to sell me the rights to every book he wrote for 
$500," said Bill. "I refused. I told him that wouldn't be fair. Too bad I 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's widow, Alberta, disputes this claim, saying: "That's not true. He 
didn't do anything of the kind." 
</P>
<P>
Lipson said he is not qualified to serve as a spokesman for the studio or his 
production team. But he sounded a conciliatory note. 
</P>
<P>
"As someone who has a great deal of affection for the material, I'd like to see 
this worked out with the Thompson family," he said. "In my opinion, aside from 
Columbia owning the rights, my sentiment is that if -- and when -- the movie 
gets made, that fairness should be done." PATRICK GOLDSTEIN

THE EPIC, AN ENDANGERED SPECIES; 
</P>
<P>
THE WORLD ISN'T THE PLACE IT WAS WHEN OUR SCREEN HEROES WENT A-CONQUERING, BUT 
TODAY'S CINEMA COULD USE A LITTLE MORE OF THAT SCOPE 
</P>

David Lean, the recipient of this year's American Film Institute Lifetime 
Achievement Award, is the world's leading exemplar of the epic film maker. At 
82, he's preparing to direct an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's great, mad novel 
"Nostromo," and already the project is being talked about not only as Lean's 
Last Stand but, also, as the last great outpost of the epic adventure film. The 
lionization of Lean is both a tribute to the grandeur of his best work, like 
"Lawrence of Arabia," and a recognition that such grandeur has mostly vanished 
from the screen. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, a Lean-like movie recently opened, Bob Rafelson's "Mountains of 
the Moon," about Sir Richard Burton and the quest for the source of the Nile. 
It's an epic, all right, but a dull one. Still, those of us who love 
grand-scale spectacle may be willing to indulge the film for old time's sake. 
The form inspires, even if the movie doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
Epic adventure movies have never been in large supply but, until the last 
several decades, they were a dependably tried-and-true staple. Films like "King 
Solomon's Mines," both the 1937 and 1950 versions, or the 1939 "Stanley and 
Livingstone" -- to name a few of my faves -- delivered uncomplicated 
storylines, stalwart heroes and lots of fervid junglescapes. As 
racial-historical tracts, they never rose much above the Call-Me-Bwana level, 
but that didn't seem to matter much. Except as fantasies, nobody took these 
films seriously anyway. They were the product of eras which could easily 
accommodate their Victorianized boys'-book reactionaryism. Heroism was defined 
as action, and action was most often expressed as the use of force. 
</P>
<P>
But all that was a while ago. In cultural terms, the comparatively "politically 
aware" eras that followed exposed the Great White Hunter trappings of these 
films and made their continuation in the same form untenable. The ways in which 
the white hunters were championed and the natives devalued was perceived as a 
noxious simplification -- an evasion of the true nature of colonialism. 
</P>
<P>
There are other reasons for the demise of the epic adventure film. For one, 
costs have become prohibitive, at least in theory. ("Mountains of the Moon" was 
financed for a relatively measly $18 million; Bertolucci's "The Last Emperor" 
cost around $23 million.) Studios are still quite capable of coughing up kingly 
fortunes to finance their movies, but they tend to put their bucks into star 
salaries and hardware. Making a movie involving oodles of extras and far-off 
locations, with period sets and costumes, is not the sort of expedition that 
Hollywood's Great White Studio Heads are particularly willing to endure. 
</P>
<P>
Movies of exploration are also regarded as antiquated in the modern era. What 
is there left to discover? Territorial exploration has moved beyond earthly 
borders. Outer space is the new uncharted jungle -- just substitute hostile 
aliens (usually "dark") for hostile natives. In such a play-act universe, 
heroes and villains can act out the same old reactionary scenarios without 
rankling any real-world political sensitivities. 
</P>
<P>
The never-never-land settings also make it possible to portray, often 
tongue-in-cheek, the kind of straight-arrow, unambiguous heroes who can no 
longer be comfortably depicted in American movies in the post-Vietnam phase. 
Vietnam altered the portrayal of heroism in American movies by calling into 
question the country's motivations for foreign expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
The image of the American as the square-jawed avenger of injustice was turned 
on its head; in counterculture terms, what once was regarded as heroism was 
converted into a species of villainy. The use of force carried tragic 
consequences. The new hero who emerged from this smoking debris turned out to 
be the man who valued his ability to run away from danger. He wasn't John 
Wayne. He was Woody Allen and Richard Pryor. This has changed somewhat. 
Currently, the new product line of American movie hero is the one who voyages 
inward. Victories are not territorial but emotional, and small-scale -- they're 
about learning how to read, how to love again. 
</P>
<P>
Within the past few decades, the adventure epic, when it hasn't transferred to 
outer space, has been almost exclusively spoofy. From the "Indiana Jones" cycle 
on down to "Romancing the Stone" and "Sheena, Queen of the Jungle," these epics 
buy off their antique ooga-booga ideologies by turning the whole expeditionary 
enterprise into a joke. They bring to the fore the absurdities that were always 
lurking just below the stalwart surface of the genre. It's understandable that 
a director like Steven Spielberg, who by his own admission was in strong 
measure formed as a film maker watching such movies as "Lawrence of Arabia," 
would feel drawn to the epic form; or that, given his essentially 
kicky-adolescent world view, he would instinctively lampoon the form as a way 
of making it his own. But even the best of these adventure spoofs are somewhat 
disappointing -- weightless. There isn't much that's awesome in the movies 
anymore, and so it's disconcerting to see awe-inspiring feats in majestic 
landscapes reduced to rinky-dink high jinks. 
</P>
<P>
When epic adventures aren't being spoofy, they are often being revisionist. In 
movies like "Greystoke" and "The Mission," the form is used as an ideological 
chalkboard. The pure pleasures of epic panorama are subverted to the "message," 
which is often bulky and overweening: the Nature of Man, the Nature of 
Imperialism, and so on. There's nothing illicit about using a king-size canvas 
to push a personal agenda -- D.W. Griffith did it -- but too many of the 
agendas are as bloated as their movie's budgets. Movies are an inadequate 
medium for conveying complex sociopolitical arguments; they're much better at 
sensation and immediacy, and the epic form only tends to emphasize the 
inadequacy. 
</P>
<P>
The demise of the epic-adventure film is, of course, all-of-a-piece with the 
demise of the epic film in general. The epic survives in its purest form not on 
the big screen but on the small, as miniseries. Films with subjects of epic 
historical scope like, say, "Roots" or "The Thorn Birds" or "Lonesome Dove," 
are now almost strictly the province of television. 
</P>
<P>
It's ironic that the movie business, which reacted to the threat of television 
in the '50s by scaling things big and high and wide, should now have turned 
tail and relinquished the epic to the airwaves. An entire generation of young 
viewers has grown up with a distorted idea of the epic film, because the epics 
they watch are all housed in a small box, where most of the qualities that made 
them worth watching are eliminated. Many of the movie theaters in the 
multiplexes are small boxes too. Is it any wonder film makers are so reluctant 
to embark on epic projects? 
</P>
<P>
It may only be a matter of time before television also disposes of the epic 
form. The disappointing ratings for a humongous series like "War and 
Remembrance" was taken as an object lesson by the networks; it's doubtful that, 
in the current climate, even a "Lonesome Dove" could be made again. The 
sound-bite ethos of television has taken its toll on the national attention 
span and cramped the medium's ability to convey the significance of monumental 
events. Television is being employed without a sense of historical moment; you 
would never know from watching most news shows that we are in the middle of one 
of greatest global political shifts in the 20th Century. The epic movie is 
predicated on a sense of narrative history, and that sense is increasingly 
absent from mass culture. 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't mean that good epics, exploration-adventure or otherwise, still 
can't, or shouldn't be made. It's a mistake to assume that these movies have to 
cost zillions, or that they should only respond to the four-square conservatism 
of the times by mythologizing four-square conservative heroes. Epics can 
embrace diverse mythologies -- it all depends who's doing the mythologizing. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a mistake to discount old-fashioned "King Solomon's Mines"-type 
squareness. Square doesn't necessarily have to be reactionary; it can be 
beautiful too. The impulse to create comprehensible heroes who live on in some 
protected precinct of our childhoods is not to be belittled. Probably the best 
epic adventure movie of the past 15 years, John Huston's "The Man Who Would Be 
King," was frankly and unapologetically an outsider's vision, with no attempt 
to "modernize" its view of the natives. On the other side, "Lawrence of Arabia" 
demonstrated that the epic adventure could accommodate a hero who was, at 
bottom, incomprehensible. Lean's stately craftsmanship set off T.E. Lawrence's 
depth-charged psychological ambiguities, and that's what made the film seem so 
traditional and yet so modern. 
</P>
<P>
The epic form is alive as long as there are writers and directors with epic 
imaginations, and actors who can embody their visions. And there are, there 
are. We're surrounded by directors (Roger Spottiswoode, Geoff Murphy, and Fred 
Schepisi, for starters) and actors (Nick Nolte, Judy Davis, Denzel Washington, 
Aidan Quinn immediately come to mind) who carry around even in their 
small-scale work an epic purchase on history. They're poised for heroic themes. 
</P>
<P>
Epic movies aren't some lumbering offshoot of the medium. Their sheer bigness 
is basic to the medium, as basic as the quality of stardom. If you were born 
before the '60s, chances are that the movies that first opened your eyes were 
the swashbuckling spectacles. They may not always have been very good, but they 
suggested reaches of adventure and heroism and history that made moviegoing the 
most exciting of romances. It's high time to renew the romance. 
</P>
<P>
I can't wait for "Nostromo."

PLAYER-CONDUCTORS: FLIGHTS OF FANCY?; 
</P>

INSTRUMENTALISTS WHO CHOOSE TO LEAD FROM THE KEYBOARD OR FIRST CHAIR CLAIM IT 
INSPIRES CREATIVITY -- BUT CRITICS CALL IT AN EGO TRIP

Seated at the concertmaster's chair, music director Iona Brown is putting the 
Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra through its paces in Tchaikovsky's "Rococo" 
Variations. Picking up her violin, she joins the strings in a passionate 
pizzicato, before raising her bow to admonish the nearby winds. Later, she 
cradles her instrument while sculpting a gentle phrase with a free hand. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who leads the 40-member ensemble in a series of concerts this week at 
Ambassador Auditorium and Royce Hall, both plays and conducts from the front 
desk, a centuries-old practice she adopted from her mentor, Neville Marriner. 
</P>
<P>
"I could not bear just being a violin soloist," says Brown, who studied with 
Henryk Szeryng. "There are so many of them and they play everything. I feel 
much happier directing myself; it's much easier for me to be in the driver's 
seat." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, as instrumentalists succumb to the lure of the podium, many like 
Brown are opting to combine disciplines in performance and lead from either the 
keyboard or the first chair. 
</P>
<P>
These musicians, from early music proponent Trevor Pinnock to Andre Previn, 
have adopted special techniques to enhance communication with their players. At 
rehearsals, every nuance is carefully orchestrated, with body language assuming 
a crucial role. For some, eye contact with orchestra members is vital; others 
propel rhythmic impulses with their own sense of urgency. With a defiant thrust 
of a chin, a busy pianist can call in the brass; and with a wave of a hand, 
herald the tutti. And in a slow movement, a cantabile can be coaxed with a 
mere, raised eyebrow. 
</P>
<P>
While the romantic literature that commands larger orchestral forces remains 
mostly off limits, repertory of the Baroque era, as well as the concerti of 
Mozart, Haydn and early Beethoven, lends itself well to the practice, according 
to those interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, obstacles remain. Allan Vogel, L.A. Chamber Orchestra principal 
oboist finds his ability to honor Brown's musical intent depends largely on the 
hairdo sported by the string player who sits in his sight line. If violinist 
Lisa Johnson pulls her hair back, Vogel says Brown is easy to follow. Should 
Johnson wear her locks loose, Vogel often must take his cues from the other 
winds. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever sees Iona picks up her cues and communicates to the others in the 
section," Vogel explained. "Listen, there are some conductors who are hard to 
follow even if they're standing up there." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Brown is perplexed that some Los Angeles concertgoers find her methods 
distracting. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles is definitely the place where people want me to just stand up and 
conduct," says Brown, in a backstage interview following the rehearsal. "I 
don't get this reaction in London or Scandinavia. (Brown also directs the 
Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields and the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra). In 
fact, what I do is commonplace in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Brown believes her strength lies in her abilities as an artist, rather than as 
verbal communicator. 
</P>
<P>
"Some critics say I lack spontaneity," Brown says. "I disagree. I communicate 
through the music and demonstrate what I want. Not having a conductor puts more 
responsibility on the players, making them more aware of what is going on 
elsewhere within the orchestra. This can be very freeing." 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Leonard, Los Angeles Philharmonic principal cellist, thinks that some 
conductor/soloists are "up there playing on an ego trip." Leonard also finds 
the symphony orchestra too large to be lead by instrumentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, it looks great to an audience," Leonard says. "They think it's amazing 
that someone can play and do it all. But it's pretty rare for an 
instrumentalist to really know the score. Besides, there is not the same 
security for musicians that there is when someone is conducting. It's not the 
same as having a (Carlo Maria) Giulini up there. And when you get beyond a 
chamber orchestra, it becomes harder to communicate." 
</P>
<P>
Philippe Entremont, pianist and music director for life of the Vienna Chamber 
Orchestra (who has formerly held conducting posts in Denver and New Orleans), 
cautions would-be conductors that doing double duty in concert "is not a 
hobby." 
</P>
<P>
"So many cellists, violinists and even singers are attracted to the glamour of 
the podium," Entremont said from Paris. "But those who are able to make this 
work have been confirmed conductors; music directors of orchestras. This makes 
all the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Early music proponent Trevor Pinnock, who leads his English Concert from the 
harpsichord "when practical," says his own playing generates a lot of rhythm 
and excitement to the musicians immediately surrounding him, which in turn is 
communicated to the entire group. 
</P>
<P>
"Giving visual signs is not necessarily the best. It's sometimes better if the 
players have to listen than watch," Pinnock says. "For this to work, the 
musicians have got to be comfortable with what they are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Tchaikovsky Competition winner Vladimir Ashkenazy, who also serves as music 
director of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and principal guest conductor of 
the Cleveland Orchestra, says that assuming a dual role on stage "gives more 
variety" to his concerts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a well-known pianist," he explains by phone from London, "and doing this 
attracts more people." Ashkenazy says it also allows him to shape pieces in his 
own image. 
</P>
<P>
"Often I have collaborated with conductors and the result is not as good as 
when doing it my way," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Previn stresses that collaborative efforts should feel normal and not take on 
"the attributes of a circus." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always afraid that this will be looked at as a kind of stunt, and it's far 
from that," says Previn, who moves the piano to the midst of the orchestra to 
play/conduct with his back to the audience. "This method is an outgrowth of a 
musical idea. If the orchestra is really listening to the soloist and each 
other it all becomes very natural." 
</P>
<P>
In selecting repertory, pianist/Houston Symphony music director Christoph 
Eschenbach avoids anything beyond early Beethoven. If there are more than 10 
first violinists, he says, it becomes more difficult to maintain contact with 
the players. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually do Mozart concerti or early Beethoven or Bach," says Eschenbach. "I 
regard these performances as large-scale chamber works rather than orchestral 
works." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Ashkenazy has been known to conduct all five Beethoven concertos from the 
keyboard. (He says he adapts the orchestral forces to his needs and where 
applicable, concludes the cadenza with one hand, bringing the orchestra in with 
the other). Entremont has ventured the Shostakovich Second; Previn recalls even 
the Ravel G-major and Prokofiev Third having been done this way. 
</P>
<P>
Most violinist/directors are content to double up solely on the concerto 
repertory. Shlomo Mintz says he's courageous enough to essay the Mendelssohn 
Concerto and the Beethoven with his Israel Chamber Orchestra. Yet few will 
dabble with the symphonic output. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Mintz will play along with the "Brandenburg" Concertos, as will Yehudi 
Menuhin. In fact, Menuhin, who often tours with his English Chamber Orchestra, 
says he'll join in "anything Bach." Then of course there's David Zinman, the 
Grammy award-winning Baltimore Symphony conductor who likes to fiddle with 
Strauss waltzes and polkas. (He will present a Viennese evening this summer at 
the Hollywood Bowl). 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to keep his name on the marquee, Stephen Bishop-Kovacevich usually 
appears as piano soloist and conductor on the same bill. He aspires to direct 
the symphonies of Tchaikovsky and Brahms and do opera -- he cites a recent 
performance of Tchaikovsky's "Pathetique" with Simon Rattle's Birmingham 
Symphony -- and expects to perform two Mozart concertos with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic this summer at Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I think playing and conducting is easier," Bishop-Kovacevich said by phone 
from London. "It can be awful though until you get used to it." 
</P>
<P>
Brown with her L.A. Chamber Orchestra enthusiastically participates in 
overtures, symphonies, concerti and in accompanying soloists. 
</P>
<P>
Refusing to specialize in any particular period, and embracing the repertory 
from Baroque to the present, Brown constantly seeks new challenges. Due to the 
large orchestral forces involved, she stays away from the symphonies of 
Bruckner and Mahler. And because of the complexities of the score, she eschews 
the likes of Bartok's "Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta." 
</P>
<P>
"I love to have the opportunity with all my groups to do the widest possible 
repertory," Brown says. "When a piece involves 25 players, we work together as 
an enlarged string quartet. When it comes to the last symphonies of Mozart, I 
face the orchestra and do a lot of conducting. 
</P>
<P>
"I try at all times to be discreet. After all, the accent must be on the music 
and not too much on a big personality. If the end result sounds good, does it 
really matter how one achieves it?"

JUST WHAT IS A DELICATESSEN SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE, ANYWAY? 
</P>

Last Oct. 21, Marvin Saul called a meeting of his employees, all 189 of them, 
in the parking lot of his Junior's restaurant. The agenda: the reopening of 
Junior's, which at that moment was undergoing the final stages of a major 
remodel job. But as the staff sat in their rented chairs, expecting a litany of 
procedural information, Marvin Saul dropped a bombshell. After 30 years in the 
business, he was handing the business over to his sons. "It's the beginning of 
a new era," Saul told his employees. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after Saul's announcement, Junior's reopened its doors to the public 
as a completely new version of its old self. Not only was Junior's in the hands 
of a younger generation, it had a younger, contemporary look. Junior's now 
seemed almost trendy. 
</P>
<P>
When Marvin Davis decided to open a Carnegie Deli in Beverly Hills, he hired a 
big-name architect, Pat Kuleto, whose projects include Wolfgang Puck's Postrio 
in San Francisco. Kuleto's design has been controversial -- some have 
complained that the new Carnegie is too upscale. 
</P>
<P>
The new Carnegie and the remodeled Junior's have left deli mavens in Los 
Angeles struggling to adjust. Mostly, they worry, delis don't look like delis 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"Exactly," Marvin Saul says, not without pride. "The new look at Junior's is 
the antithesis of a typical deli, really upscale. Some people ask, 'Why didn't 
you leave it alone?' I say half of life is change. You have to give people what 
they want for the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
"People hate changes -- they're afraid," says Abe Lebewohl, owner of New York's 
Second Avenue deli. "When I expanded in '73, oh my God! Over and over, I'd 
hear, 'I liked the old place.' But believe me, the old place was a horror. And 
of course people got used to the new place. It's still a deli." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to defining exactly what a deli is supposed to look like, even 
the experts have trouble coming up with a simple answer. 
</P>
<P>
"A deli," says Art Ginsburg, owner of Art's Deli in Studio City (slogan: Where 
every sandwich is a work of art), "is what a coffee shop is: very plain, very 
simple, well-lit, vinyl floor, no carpeting. The booths are not high-backed 
booths; but lower, you know, open to the hubbub. " 
</P>
<P>
"What's a deli supposed to look like?" says Al Mendelson, owner of Nate n' Al's 
in Beverly Hills (a carpeted deli). "Well, in Jewish, they say it's haimisch. 
You need old-timers like myself with know-how -- you know I'm 85 years young -- 
to make people feel comfortable. But everything's changing. I think delis are 
getting to be a thing of the past." 
</P>
<P>
"Go no further," says Fred Austin, co-owner (with his brother-in-law, Alan 
Dell) of Katz Deli on New York's Houston St. "We're the archetypal deli. We're 
the pattern and the criteria by which all others are judged. We've been here 
103 years. Did you see 'When Harry Met Sally . . . '? Do you remember the 
orgasm scene? That's the consummate deli experience. If you don't leave Katz's 
breathing heavy, then we're not doing our job right." 
</P>
<P>
"What you have to really realize," says Carnegie architect Pat Kuleto, "is that 
until recently, there was no such thing as deli design. They were always 
started on a budget, so you'd simply buy the cheapest restaurant equipment. 
Then you'd put a few sandwich signs up on the wall, a few pictures of the 
owner, a couple of notices from the government and a few posters supplied maybe 
by the RC Cola Company or something. You'd turn the lights up real bright, hang 
a bunch of sausages around and show the food, you know, cause that was kind of 
the program -- to just show off the food. And that was it -- they called it a 
deli." 
</P>
<P>
Or as Second Avenue's Abe Lebewohl puts it: "Jewish-type delis started out as 
what they used to call dry kishka stores -- nothing fancy -- I mean it's not Le 
Cirque. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course as people's tastes changed and so on, delis went into other things," 
Lebewohl continues. "Delis started taking over; they started becoming 
restaurants. When I started in the business in 1950, prices were higher, 
expenses were more, you needed to expand and hire good cooks." 
</P>
<P>
For Pat Kuleto, the 1950s marked the end of the great deli era. His design of 
the Carnegie in Beverly Hills snubs all post-1950 design elements. "The 
fantasy, or trick," he says, "was to try and create a space that had enough of 
the classic old feelings of the way delis should have been done -- prior to the 
advent of the '50s when everything in remodeling was ruined by Formica and 
plastic and all the crud of mechanization." 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody decorates different," Art Ginsburg says. "It's like people's homes. 
You know, some people decorate with an Oriental theme, some do Italian or 
Spanish -- right now it's that Southwest look. Same with delis. See, times 
change. In each decade, the remodeling's been different. In the '50s they used 
certain color combinations: yellow and green. We started in '57 and have tried 
to maintain the same look -- I still have my original neon sign with the 
blinking arrow and I've never wanted to take it down. The last time we 
remodeled was about four years ago -- we changed the fabric color of the booths 
a little bit, but we still kept it in earth tones. I stopped by Junior's 
recently and I think it came out very good. It's still got its counter -- and 
after all, that's the difference between a restaurant and a deli. A deli is a 
counter." 
</P>
<P>
"A deli is the smell, it's the aroma, it's the noise," Katz's Fred Austin says. 
"A deli is striped down to its bare essentials -- Formica tables, chairs, the 
only concession we make is we pad our chairs. In 1948 the store was extended, 
and that's the last time anything was touched. When bulbs burn out we change 
them. And we change the calendars as need dictates . . . and obviously when 
there's a movie, like 'When Harry Met Sally. . . ' filmed here -- did I tell 
you it was filmed here? -- we put up some signs in the windows as display." 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Saul used to think a lot like the people at Katz. 
</P>
<P>
"I absolutely resisted change at first," Saul says. "You know the saying 'a 
rose is a rose is a rose'? Well, I felt a deli is a deli is a deli. But my sons 
taught me that to stay even you've got to make changes. Otherwise you fall 
behind." 
</P>
<P>
Still, this latest remodel wasn't as easy for Saul as he likes people to 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
"The first night," Jonathan Saul remembers, "when we went to destroy the place 
and started breaking down tables I said, 'Dad, break something, I know you've 
always wanted to.' So he took a sledgehammer and started to swing at a table, 
but then he stopped, put the hammer down and said, 'I've got to go home.' He 
left with a tear in his eye."

Stormie Jones, the world's first heart-liver transplant recipient, was 
discharged from Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh 17 days after undergoing a 
second liver transplant. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-year-old girl from White Settlement, Tex., will remain in the city for 
about two weeks for outpatient treatment, hospital spokeswoman Lynn McMahon 
said. Stormie received her second liver transplant in a 10-hour operation Feb. 
20. She had undergone a heart-and-liver transplant in 1984. The heart has not 
caused any problems, but she needed a new liver because the first was damaged 
by hepatitis.

STUART'S MOTHER TO TESTIFY, PAPERS SAY

The mother of suspected wife killer Charles Stuart reportedly will testify this 
week before the special grand jury trying to shed more light on the murder 
case. Dorothy Stuart may also be asked to waive the attorney-client privilege 
that prevents her son's lawyer from speaking out on the case, according to 
reports in the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald. 
</P>
<P>
First Assistant Dist. Atty. Paul K. Leary told the Globe it appears the right 
to waive the attorney-client privilege may be transferred from the client to 
the client's legal representative after the client's death. Charles Stuart 
committed suicide by leaping from a bridge Jan. 4 as police sought to arrest 
him. The Suffolk County grand jury is investigating the shooting death of Carol 
Stuart, a pregnant attorney, and subsequent revelations that her husband was 
the likely culprit.

BAD COMPUTER TAPE DELAYS TAX REFUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in a week, thousands of tax refunds have been delayed by 
the Internal Revenue Service's outdated computer system. The IRS said 171,000 
returns filed into the Ogden, Utah, service center from 25 Midwestern and 
Northwestern states were delayed because of a faulty computer tape. 
</P>
<P>
That number included 31,000 returns filed electronically. An IRS spokeswoman 
said electronic filers will still get quick refunds, but it will be toward the 
end of the two- to three-week time frame promised. Filers of paper returns have 
been getting refunds in five to six weeks. Through March 3, the IRS had 
received 38.6 million returns, up 3% from the 37.5 million in the same period 
last year. Processing is up 15%, 25.3 million compared to 22 million a year 
ago.

Striking teachers were voting on a proposal to return to classrooms while 
negotiators try again to settle a pay dispute that led to their 3-day-old 
walkout. Gov. Gaston Caperton offered to refrain from docking teachers' pay and 
benefits for days they missed since the walkout began last Wednesday if they 
return to work Monday. Voting was scheduled to continue in some counties today. 
Teachers say the average West Virginia teacher salary of $21,904 ranks the 
state 49th in the nation, ahead of only Mississippi.

SUSPECTED SHOOTER OF DEAF BROTHERS RETURNED TO L.A.

Joey Paul Bellinger, the fugitive 16-year-old boy arrested nine days ago in 
Upstate New York on suspicion of killing a deaf man and wounding his deaf 
brother in Granada Hills, has been returned to Los Angeles in the custody of 
detectives, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The boy is in custody at Sylmar Juvenile Hall after arriving about 10:30 p.m. 
Friday, Officer Terence Kibodeaux said. Bellinger was accompanied by two Los 
Angeles police detectives who flew to New York earlier last week after FBI 
agents arrested the boy at the home of a family acquaintance in Utica, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Michelle Rosenblatt said Bellinger 
probably will be arraigned Monday or Tuesday in Sylmar Juvenile Court. A 
hearing to decide whether to grant a prosecution request that the boy be tried 
as an adult will be scheduled at the arraignment, Rosenblatt said. 
</P>
<P>
Bellinger is charged with murder in the slaying of Cesar Vieira, 30, and 
attempted murder in the shooting of Edward Vieira, 25, during a confrontation 
Jan. 28 near Balboa Boulevard and Devonshire Street. 
</P>
<P>
Bellinger was riding in a car with four friends when they drove up next to the 
Vieiras, who were on a motorcycle. The two groups exchanged stares and pulled 
into a parking lot, police said. The brothers, who communicated mainly through 
sign language, apparently did not understand what was happening, police said. 
The brief confrontation ended with gunfire, resulting in the death of Cesar 
Vieira and the wounding of Edward, who is now recovering at his home. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, the boy's father, Joseph Paul Bellinger Sr., 40, said he 
was in contact with his son but would not turn him in unless authorities 
promised not to prosecute him as an adult. Police last week arrested the father 
at his Long Beach home on suspicion of aiding and abetting a felon. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was arrested March 2 at the home of Susan Alguire, who told a local 
newspaper that the boy's mother, Phyllis, called her Jan. 30 asking if the 
youth could stay with her until the rest of the family joined him at a later 
date. Alguire said the mother, a high school friend, did not mention that the 
boy was wanted in the murder. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities arrested the boy after receiving a tip. He appeared Tuesday in 
Oneida County Court in New York and consented to return to California without 
an extradition hearing, officials said.

RELATIVES SAY MENENDEZ 2 ARE INNOCENT 
</P>

An uncle of Lyle and Erik Menendez said Saturday that he and other relatives 
believe that the two brothers have been wrongly accused of brutally murdering 
their wealthy parents in their Beverly Hills mansion last August. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think in the least circumstance that they are guilty of what they 
have been accused," said Carlos Baralt, a New Jersey businessman who also is 
the executor of the Menendez family's $14-million estate. "We are behind the 
boys 100%." 
</P>
<P>
He said he had heard there was circumstantial evidence pointing toward Lyle and 
Erik as suspects, but said he is confident that there is evidence pointing in 
other directions as well. "I really, really believe that the whole situation 
with the kids is something (police) have fallen into for lack of a better 
lead," he said. "I feel they acted, perhaps, precipitously. 
</P>
<P>
"The police don't know these kids like I do," Baralt said. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle, 22, was arrested Thursday and is scheduled to be arraigned on Monday. His 
younger brother, Erik, 19, had been playing in a professional tennis tournament 
in Israel, but was reported heading back to the United States to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills police said Saturday that they had no information on when or 
where a surrender might occur. Lyle Menendez's attorney, Gerald Chaleff, said 
that Erik wanted to accomplish the surrender with "a little dignity." 
</P>
<P>
Jose Menendez, 45, chief executive of Live Entertainment Inc. of Van Nuys, a 
video and music distributor, and his wife Kitty, 44, were slain in a barrage of 
shotgun blasts at close range as they watched television in the first-floor 
library of their Elm Drive home last Aug. 20. Their sons said they found the 
bodies when they returned from a night out. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they had considered the brothers suspects for some time but only 
recently did they find "the glue" that brought the case together, an apparent 
reference to the seizure of tape-recorded conversations between the brothers 
and a psychologist that occurred after the murders. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle and Erik are the sole heirs of their parents' estate, valued at $14 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Baralt said he heard from Erik late Thursday night. According to the uncle, 
Erik had telephoned a roommate in California, learned of his brother's arrest 
earlier in the day, and then called Baralt, the uncle said. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him the best thing he could do was to turn himself in," Baralt said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
He said Erik immediately agreed. He said he was not sure how the surrender 
would take place, but that it was being worked out through "a third party."

USE OF L.A. OFFICERS OUTSIDE CITY PROBED; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE: SOURCES SAY DEPUTY CHIEF GLENN A. LEVANT DISPATCHED DETECTIVES TO A 
CHIC HOTEL WHOSE OWNER HAS BUSINESS TIES TO TWO LEVANT RELATIVES AND DARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department is examining allegations that its drug czar, 
Deputy Chief Glenn A. Levant, dispatched a team of elite narcotics detectives 
outside city limits to investigate burglaries at a chic hotel whose owner has 
business ties to two relatives of Levant, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives spent two days last November staking out Le Mondrian hotel in West 
Hollywood after a representative of the hotel's owner called Levant, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Le Mondrian's owner, Severyn Ashkenazy, employs Levant's brother-in-law, 
Richard Chase, as president of a company based in Le Mondrian. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Chase arranged a six-figure deal between one of Ashkenazy's companies 
and the LAPD to rent unmarked cars for use by detectives under Levant's 
command, according to company officials. 
</P>
<P>
Ashkenazy also has business ties to Levant's wife, Jayne. He helps fund and 
direct a hotel referral service that she runs from an office in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ashkenazy sits on the 100-member board of a non-profit 
organization that raises money for Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE), the 
Police Department's acclaimed anti-narcotics school program that Levant 
directs. 
</P>
<P>
Questions involving the Le Mondrian investigation surfaced earlier this year 
during a routine management audit of all narcotics operations, police sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Levant, 49, said he has done nothing improper. He declined to publicly discuss 
matters relating to Le Mondrian except to say that "there was a logical 
investigative reason" for sending officers to the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Police Department policy, Levant said, prevented him from responding more fully 
pending the outcome of the audit, which is being coordinated by a top aide to 
Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
Levant pointed out that it was he who initiated the audit in January to assess 
all facets of the LAPD's anti-narcotics activities. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, through a spokesman, also declined to answer questions about Levant 
until the audit is completed. That process is expected to take at least another 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department has a conflict-of-interest code that requires officers to 
submit a statement of disqualification to the chief "if they believe that they 
are involved in a department decision-making process in which they have a 
conflict of interest." The department's manual does not make clear what is 
considered a conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Gates's spokesman, Cmdr. William Booth, declined to comment on whether Levant 
filed a disqualification statement on matters relating to Le Mondrian. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles police officer for 27 years, Levant is regarded by some in the 
department as a contender to eventually succeed Gates. 
</P>
<P>
Gates named Levant deputy chief in September, 1987, and to the informal 
position of drug czar four months later. 
</P>
<P>
Levant devotes much of his time raising public support for DARE, whose annual 
budget has grown to more than $1 million under his direction. Levant also 
oversees various department functions, including the internal affairs and 
organized crime divisions. He commands nearly 400 narcotics investigators and 
has broad discretion in setting their missions. 
</P>
<P>
One such mission involved Le Mondrian, according to police sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 20-21, a team of detectives assigned to the LAPD's Major Violators 
Section, which normally investigates top-level drug traffickers, went to the 
hotel at Levant's direction, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Several detectives checked into two rooms at the hotel. They set up electronic 
surveillance equipment and left an undisclosed amount of "bait" money in one 
room and monitored the room from the other room. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, after no one had taken the money, the detectives ended the 
stakeout and left the hotel, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers eventually were paid overtime by the city for the two-day 
surveillance and were reimbursed for their expenses, said one source. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials would not say how much the operation cost. 
</P>
<P>
It is not uncommon for detectives from the 47 municipal law enforcement 
agencies in Los Angeles County to conduct surveillance outside their normal 
geographic areas of assignment. But normally, they pursue investigations that 
are initiated within their own jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the theft complaint was initiated in Los Angeles County, not the 
city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As a rule, police are required to alert officials of the city in which they are 
temporarily operating. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Le Mondrian, sources said, detectives telephoned the watch 
commander at the sheriff's West Hollywood station in advance. 
</P>
<P>
What was unusual, sources said, was the nature of the investigation itself. 
</P>
<P>
"These (detectives) are heavy hitters who go after big fish, Colombians," said 
one officer. "This case had nothing to do with narcotics. There was a problem 
with (theft). It was a waste of their time. But, hey, (Levant is) the drug 
czar. How you gonna say no?" 
</P>
<P>
According to Ashkenazy, the LAPD investigation came about after several guests 
complained of thefts from their rooms. Those burglaries, he said, happened to 
coincide with rumors that a drug ring had set up shop in the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"We arranged for the Police Department . . . to come and see what it was we had 
here," Ashkenazy said. "Strange enough, it ceased as soon as the word got out." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the Le Mondrian did not request assistance from the Sheriff's 
Department, in whose jurisdiction Le Mondrian is located, Ashkenazy said, "The 
sheriff is not equipped to deal with drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Deputies at the West Hollywood station -- which is less than a mile from Le 
Mondrian -- said they could not recall being notified by LAPD about any 
problems at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's narcotics chief disputed Ashkenazy's assertion that his 
department was not equipped to handle such a case. "Had they called the 
sheriff," Capt. Bob Wilbur said, "we would have responded and we would have 
done surveillance." 
</P>
<P>
Ashkenazy's executive vice president, attorney Gary W. Nielsen, said he 
contacted Levant to discuss thefts at the hotel -- including the theft of some 
drugs from a guest about two months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't call to report a crime, but to initially ask for some advice on a 
matter I viewed as sensitive," Nielsen said. Nielsen called Levant, he said, 
because he "wanted someone with expertise . . . I see him once in a while at 
parties and at dinners . . . It's a first name basis. He is a person I admire 
very much." 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen said he asked Levant whether the hotel should hire a private detective. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he told me there weren't private detectives that would have much 
knowledge about drugs and that this was something his department would look 
into," Nielsen recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Other hotels commonly hire private investigative agencies to take on such 
cases, according to detectives and hoteliers. 
</P>
<P>
Since August, 1988, Levant's brother-in-law, Richard Chase, has been president 
of an Ashkenazy company, Resources Exchange, located on the second floor of Le 
Mondrian. 
</P>
<P>
The company barters goods and services ranging from hotel rooms to billboard 
advertising in exchange for items of equal or greater value. 
</P>
<P>
According to Nielsen, Chase "made the deal" to sell rental car services to the 
Police Department in late 1988. Chase traded billboard and bus stop advertising 
to RPM Rent-a-Car of Los Angeles for more than $100,000 in rental car services, 
Neilsen said. 
</P>
<P>
The rental car services then were sold to the Police Department for use by 
plainclothes officers. Nielsen said the cars cost the department "20% less than 
they were paying" at the time to other rental companies. 
</P>
<P>
Chase, according to Nielsen, "was very proud of the fact that it was one of his 
first or second deals." The arrangement with RPM was one of several negotiated 
by Chase that year. 
</P>
<P>
"The company had a good year (in 1989) and this was a small part of that good 
year," Nielsen said. "He got a bonus for 1989." 
</P>
<P>
The car rental arrangement ended about a year later, in part because virtually 
every RPM car was white, which distressed narcotics officers. 
</P>
<P>
"You can imagine getting followed by six or seven white cars," said one 
officer. "It was a joke." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Neilsen nor RPM officials would disclose the specific value of the 
rental car transaction. City Controller Rick Tuttle's office also was unable to 
provide details. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain accounts controlled by the Police Department that are not 
public," said Barbara Friedman, administrative deputy controller. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen said he did not know whether Levant had any role in the rental car 
negotiations or approved the deal. However, sources said the deal came about 
after Levant contacted Ashkenazy regarding car rentals. Chase could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
His sister and Levant's wife -- Jayne Levant -- is executive vice president of 
Small Luxury Hotels Inc., an international association of 32 hotels and 
resorts. 
</P>
<P>
Ashkenazy helped found the association and is one of its current directors, 
according to J. William Sharman Jr., a Houston, Tex., businessman who serves as 
the organization's chairman. Sharman said the association was conceived 4 1/2 
years ago by Jayne Levant. 
</P>
<P>
Sharman said that the association acts as a referral, reservations and 
promotional service for Ashkenazy and other member hotel operators. The hotel 
operators pay an initiation fee, plus $12 per room per month to the 
association. 
</P>
<P>
Ashkenazy also is among about 100 business and community leaders who serve as 
directors of the non-profit Crime Prevention Advisory Council (CPAC), which 
raises funds and organizes charity functions for DARE. The council operates out 
of Levant's office and he is its executive officer, the organization's 1988 tax 
return shows. 
</P>
<P>
Each CPAC director is asked to contribute at least $1,000 a year to DARE. 
</P>
<P>
Ashkenazy said he was not certain how much he has donated, although Nielsen 
said that Ashkenazy contributes free meeting facilities and price breaks on 
meal tabs at his Bel Age hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Ashkenazy scoffed when asked by The Times whether Levant sent detectives to Le 
Mondrian as a personal favor. 
</P>
<P>
"This is utter nonsense, you're barking up a silly tree," Ashkenazy said. "He 
(Levant) is a highly ethical man, a very bright man."

RELIGION: FIRST AFRICAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH, THE CITY'S OLDEST AFRICAN 
-- AMERICAN CONGREGATION, IS INVOLVED IN ALL FACETS OF A COMMUNITY'S LIFE.

<P>
Eight-year-old Jesse Floyd walked slowly toward the line of waiting men, 
careful not to spill his precious cargo -- a tray heaped with plates of red 
beans and rice, corn bread and salad. 
</P>
<P>
With a smile, he eased the tray into the hands of an anxious man, then scurried 
through the crowd, back to the kitchen for another load. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to help them," Jesse said, explaining his decision to forgo an evening 
of watching "Cosby" on TV to volunteer in his church's program to feed the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Like others at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church, Jesse has grown 
accustomed to helping others in need. The 5,000-member church at 2270 S. 
Harvard Blvd. in Southwest Los Angeles has been active in virtually every area 
of social work with its more than 25 task forces. 
</P>
<P>
The city's oldest African-American congregation -- and church home to such 
notables as Mayor Tom Bradley and talk show host Arsenio Hall -- First A.M.E. 
has gained a reputation for being "more than just a church." 
</P>
<P>
"First A.M.E. has an old and rich history in this community," said Danny J. 
Bakewell, executive director of the Brotherhood Crusade, a prominent community 
group. "It's always been a very activist church in terms of leading the way and 
giving direction to the community in the area of politics and social 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Recently the church has displayed that leadership in ways as varied as a 
funeral for a slain Muslim and a celebration for an African leader. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after Nation of Islam member Oliver X. Beasley was killed Jan. 23 by a 
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, more than 500 community leaders, activists 
and residents headed to First A.M.E. for a rally. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after that, Beasley's funeral was held at the church, with Nation of 
Islam leader Minister Louis Farrakhan delivering an impassioned eulogy to the 
more than 2,000 mourners. 
</P>
<P>
And when Los Angeles heard the news that Nelson R. Mandela would be released 
from prison, South African emigres and others involved in the anti-apartheid 
movement flocked to First A.M.E. and waited through the night for the first 
televised glimpse of Mandela's walk toward freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"This is symbolic of what this church means to this community," said state Sen. 
Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), who has often visited the church. "It's been a 
meeting place, it's been a forum, it's been a Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
"The activities that take place at First Church are indicative of the 
temperature of the community," Watson added. "When you watch what's happening 
there, you can pretty much size up where our community is . . . what our 
concerns are." 
</P>
<P>
Addressing those concerns is one of the primary goals of the church. 
</P>
<P>
"Every member joins the church to go beyond the church," said the Rev. Cecil L. 
(Chip) Murray, who has pastored First A.M.E. for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Murray says he has patterned his brand of church leadership on the black church 
of the past. 
</P>
<P>
"The black church by its very nature must be a freedom house," he said, 
referring to the days when churches helped transport slaves to freedom and 
provided education when the doors of white schools were closed. 
</P>
<P>
Today's church must be equally purposeful, Murray said, filling in the gaps in 
a world where "blacks have a low priority in the eyes of whites." 
</P>
<P>
"The only source left for the disenfranchised, the disinherited, the 
disillusioned, is the black church," he said. "A useless black church is 
demonic. We cannot afford the luxuries of a useless freedom house." 
</P>
<P>
While many other churches offer effective outreach programs, community leaders 
say First A.M.E. is distinguished by the depth and comprehensiveness of its 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Rev. Murray tends to be on the cutting edge of new, creative and innovative 
ideas that others tend to stand back and wait for," Bakewell said. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Robert Farrell, whose district houses the church, said: "You 
will find First A.M.E. people wherever there is any kind of civic activity 
going on in the African-American community. It has that depth of participation 
by its pastors, officers and its members." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the church's best-known pastor was Bishop H. H. Brookins. City 
officials recently concluded a conflict-of-interest investigation involving 
Brookins' dual role as landlord and head of a Southwest Los Angeles poverty 
program that received government rent subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
The city is asking for repayment of $48,259 in rent that was paid to Brookins 
since 1981. Officials say Bishop owned the building but listed an A.M.E. church 
corporation as the owner. Brookins insists that he did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
A respected and prominent figure in the civil rights movement, Brookins served 
as pastor of First A.M.E. from 1959 to 1972 and as bishop of the A.M.E church's 
Los Angeles district from 1976 to 1984. He is credited with molding the 
political careers of many political leaders, including Mayor Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who has been a member of First A.M.E. for 30 years, said the church 
"has always been in the forefront of the civil rights struggle. Its pastors 
have been among the most prominent leaders on . . . social action issues." 
</P>
<P>
That legacy of political activism and influence has far outlived Brookins' 
tenure and has become a trademark of the church. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to run for office, you have to go (to the churches)," Watson 
said. "And certainly First Church would be your first stop." 
</P>
<P>
Politicians and the poor have benefited from the church's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Through the You Took Me In Program, young Jesse Floyd and other members hosted 
more than 100 homeless men and women who recently spent the night at the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
One of the church's most publicized efforts is the Lock-In on Values program. 
For 24 hours, behind locked doors, youths ages 7 to 17 talk, listen to 
motivational speakers and view films -- all designed to steer them away from 
drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials say the lock-ins have changed the lives of many young people, 
including hard-core gang members and others in need, like 16-year-old Dakston 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Five years of living on the streets shattered the teen-ager's sense of 
self-worth. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt inferior to everyone because I had lived on the streets," he said, 
describing himself as withdrawn and sullen. 
</P>
<P>
An aunt who took Dakston and his brother in immediately got the boys involved 
in First A.M.E.'s youth camp and the lock-ins, where Dakston heard a 
presentation on self-esteem that changed his outlook on life. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I joined the church . . . I see that I'm just like everybody else. The 
lock-ins are real good. They really do help," said the 11th-grader, who now 
plays football for Westchester High School, and plans to attend college. 
</P>
<P>
Another clear concern of Murray's and the church are the problems facing 
African-American men, from a staggering unemployment rate to their 
disproportionate status as the victims of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
"The black church must be the salvation of black men and black boys," Murray 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Richard Allen Men's Society -- named for the founder of the 
A.M.E. Church -- was formed as a support group and to "teach black men how to 
love one another," said its president, Mark Whitlock. 
</P>
<P>
And the church has made a permanent impact on the city's housing problem by 
acquiring and renting out more than 100 housing units. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Vinton R. Anderson, who heads the Fifth Episcopal District, which 
includes Los Angeles, said First A.M.E.'s work is an example of what A.M.E 
churches across the nation are trying to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
Now the largest African-American Methodist denomination in the country, the 
origins of the A.M.E. church date back to 1787. 
</P>
<P>
When Richard Allen and other members of St. George's Methodist Episcopal Church 
in Philadelphia were literally pulled from their knees while attempting to pray 
in a white-only section, the group walked out, led by Allen, and later formed 
their own church. 
</P>
<P>
Today's A.M.E. church still has close ties with the 9-million-member United 
Methodist Church, a descendant of the old Methodist Episcopal Church that Allen 
broke away from. 
</P>
<P>
The First A.M.E. Church in Los Angeles was founded by Biddy Mason, a former 
slave who started the church in her home in 1872. 
</P>
<P>
While highly regarded both inside and outside the African-American community, 
some view First A.M.E. as a "buppie church," filled with young black urban 
professionals who some say are drawn to the church by its who's-who membership 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
Members quickly dismiss this claim. All classes and ages attend First A.M.E. 
and the church, they say, is like a family. 
</P>
<P>
"FAME is probably as down-home as they come," said member Roderick Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
At Sunday morning services, members freely express feelings evoked by the 
lively sermons and the soulful, yet reverent voices of the choir. Some simply 
stand, their hands lifted in praise. Others dance, clap, shout or cry. A small 
band backs the choir. 
</P>
<P>
Although the church is known for its community work, it is the spiritual 
nourishment, members say, that keeps their numbers growing. 
</P>
<P>
Members of First A.M.E. take great pride in their African-American heritage. 
And their pride and concern extends also to those outside the Christian faith, 
Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Beasley's death, the church had a longstanding relationship with 
the Nation of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
"(Minister Farrakhan) has a message that needs to be heard," Murray said, "and 
it's the same message that the black church needs to be preaching: economic 
development, spiritual development. . . . Black man, take your rightful stand 
with your black woman by your side. Black children, stand tall." 
</P>
<P>
Minister Wazir Muhammad of the local Nation of Islam mosque said the two 
religious groups stand united in their "struggle for liberation." 
</P>
<P>
"Rev. Murray is always ready and willing to do whatever he can on our behalf, 
and we stand with him as he stands with us," Muhammad said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Duff, president of the local NAACP chapter, attributed the historic 
gathering of Muslims and Christians after Beasley's death largely to the 
efforts of Murray. 
</P>
<P>
"Rev. Murray had set the groundwork for that in his sermons and in his outreach 
way before the incident took place," Duff said. 
</P>
<P>
The church also has reached beyond the black community, sponsoring meetings 
between African-Americans, Asians and Latinos and holding regular pulpit 
exchanges with Temple Isaiah. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the problems plaguing many African-Americans, Murray feels the 
prospects for the future are bright. 
</P>
<P>
"Sheer necessity will drive our people back to God," Murray said confidently. 
"The church is all we have and we must make it work."

WHITE HOUSE, FED FEUD OVER RISING DOLLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration is embroiled in another squabble with the Federal 
Reserve Board, this time over whether the United States should help stop the 
dollar's recent rise and possibly push its value lower, U.S. officials said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The split surfaced late last week when the Fed declined to join central banks 
in Europe and Japan in intervening massively in foreign exchange markets to 
help reverse the dollar's rise against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
The spat over the dollar is expected to heighten previous disagreements over 
whether the Fed has been keeping monetary policy too tight. The White House has 
warned that a failure to push U.S. interest rates lower could throw the economy 
into a slump. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials have criticized the Fed publicly for its failure to nudge 
interest rates lower. Last week, sources told The Times that Bush was so angry 
at Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan that he was unlikely to reappoint him when his 
term expires in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The argument comes at a time of unusual volatility in international financial 
markets and rising interest rates in Japan and West Germany, which in turn 
could cause rates to increase in the United States and other industrialized 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush Administration officials have insisted publicly that they are not 
concerned about rising interest rates in West Germany and Japan, they are 
privately worried that the rate-hike fever may spread. 
</P>
<P>
Both West Germany and Japan have been urging the United States to force the 
dollar down to help avert interest rate increases in their countries. A weak 
dollar gives foreign governments more leeway because it eases inflationary 
pressures in those countries. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. officials are concerned that the dollar's recent sharp rise against 
the yen could erode recent improvement in the U.S. trade deficit with Japan by 
making Japanese imports less expensive here and U.S. exports more costly, and 
thus less competitive, overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed, however, is reluctant to help drive down the dollar by reducing U.S. 
interest rates, which would cause foreign capital to seek out higher rates 
elsewhere. Its primary concern is that lower interest rates would intensify 
inflation in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Some Fed officials fear that the Treasury may be tempted to agree to a new 
accord to drive the dollar's value down at an April 7 meeting of the Group of 
Seven, the informal organization of finance officials of the United States and 
its major economic allies. 
</P>
<P>
Fed officials point to the risks involved in reducing interest rates. When they 
nudged interest rates lower last December, the financial markets were thrown 
into turmoil because it appeared the Fed might be abandoning its traditional 
role of combatting inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Fed policy-makers had to reverse course. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo last week, Fed Vice Chairman Manuel H. Johnson said he was satisfied 
with currency exchange rates as they are. He bluntly told Tokyo that if the 
Japanese fear new inflation pressures at home, "they should adopt the proper 
monetary policy" -- that is, raise interest rates in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Fed officials said the sentiments that the vice chairman expressed were shared 
by a majority of the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's remarks thrust the United States into a squabble similar to that now 
raging in Japan between the Japanese Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan. 
The central bank, worried about rising inflation pressures, wants to push 
interest rates up, but the finance ministry is protesting. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Bush Administration officials deny that they are seeking 
to drive the dollar down, but they assert that the United States should not 
allow the U.S. currency's value to rise further lest the Europeans use it as an 
excuse to raise their own interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
There has been no indication yet what action, if any, the Group of Seven might 
take if the volatility and rise in interest rates seem to be continuing in 
early April. In some cases, the group has been able to have some impact simply 
by issuing a statement of its views. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have cautioned that the Group of Seven meeting in April -- the 
first that the ministers will have held since last September -- is not an 
emergency meeting and that no major policy decisions are expected, but such 
statements are routine in advance of their meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the United States, the group includes West Germany, Japan, Britain, 
France, Italy and Canada. It meets routinely in September, February, April and 
July, and in emergency sessions when needed.

BRAZILIANS AND ARGENTINES HOARD FOOD AND BUY DOLLARS TO DEAL WITH INFLATION OF 
MORE THAN 70% A MONTH. THE CRIPPLING SPIRAL COULD THREATEN SOUTH AMERICA'S TWO 
LARGEST DEMOCRACIES.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 8:30 on a Saturday morning, hundreds of shoppers are poised at the doors of 
Paes Mendonca Hipermercado, a giant Brazilian supermarket known for its 
competitive prices. When the doors swing open, Elias Alves de Oliveira is one 
of the first to rush inside. 
</P>
<P>
He maneuvers two shopping carts to a massive stack of bagged rice. His wife and 
his sister quickly load one cart with 22 pounds of the grain. Moving up the 
aisle, they pile on 44 pounds of sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Oliveira, 34, is "stocking" -- investing in large quantities of food staples 
and household provisions as a defense against double-digit increases each week 
in the cost of living. Stocking is one of the many ways that people in Brazil 
and Argentina use to try to cope with inflation of a magnitude that few 
countries have ever seen -- more than 70% a month. 
</P>
<P>
Adjusting to such monetary madness is an everyday drama for the 180 million 
people in South America's two biggest countries as they struggle against 
personal impoverishment, business failure and national collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Some political analysts see hyper-inflation as a threat to social order and 
democracy itself in Argentina and Brazil. Last year, as Argentine prices 
spiraled toward a record monthly rate of 196% in July, popular discontent 
erupted in looting at thousands of food stores, leaving 15 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
With hyper-inflation, money in the pocket is like water on sand. Even seemingly 
astronomical interest rates paid on savings accounts -- up to 28% a day in 
Argentina in late February -- often do not keep up with inflation. And as 
buying power evaporates, people have less and less to save. 
</P>
<P>
Oliveira, a microfilm technician, said he stopped making deposits in his 
savings account several months ago and started stocking groceries in the 
certainty that their value will increase. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are able to build up a stock at home for your family, it is a better 
deal than a savings account," he said, heaping packages of sugar in the 
shopping carts before moving on to the beans. 
</P>
<P>
An hour after opening, the cavernous supermarket was clogged with shoppers, 
many of them stocking soap, detergent, cooking oil, sugar, coffee, beans, rice, 
soft drinks, canned goods and many other items. 
</P>
<P>
While Brazil's "stockers" gamely try to harness runaway grocery prices, 
consumers in Argentina increasingly react with anger. Adrian Rodriguez Boero, 
operations manager for Argentina's 60-store Disco supermarket chain, insisted 
in an interview that supermarkets are not price-setters, that they merely pass 
on increases from wholesalers. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, "we are the place where the public encounters it," Rodriguez 
Boero said. "The people complain constantly about the prices. There are always 
tensions at the tills." 
</P>
<P>
His operations problems have multiplied. The credit terms of wholesalers "have 
been tightened savagely," he said. "Suppliers demand payment in cash, or within 
48 hours at best, instead of 30 days. This requires a lot of working capital, 
and it must be killing many smaller markets." 
</P>
<P>
And merely changing the prices each day chews up many employee hours. Disco and 
other big chains have introduced bar-coding and electronic price detectors, but 
smaller stores must re-mark each item repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Although long accustomed to varying rates of rapid inflation, Brazil had never 
before experienced the dizzying velocity of the current surge. For Argentines, 
however, the feeling is sickeningly familiar after last year's ravages. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last outbreak, people ran to buy anything," Rodriguez Boero said. "It 
was a compulsive wave of purchases to unload their australs (Argentina's 
currency) before they lost value. This time, the prices are racing ahead just 
as fast. So people are running to buy dollars instead, and they are holding on 
to the dollars to see if they will buy more a bit later." 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Salas, a Disco store branch manager, said he has joined the rush for 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"Poor or rich, we are all financiers, trying to get through to the end of the 
month. When I get paid, I use as many australs as I need for rent and other 
expenses, and then use the rest to buy dollars. Many prices are even set now in 
dollars. But I don't earn dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Rosa Juarez, a 66-year-old retiree, was changing dollars with an arbolito, 
literally "small tree" but slang in Argentina for unauthorized money changers 
who stand like trees on Calle San Martin, Buenos Aires' Wall Street. She and 
her husband get about $70 in monthly pension payments. 
</P>
<P>
"At the start of the month we pay our light and gas bills and buy dollars with 
the rest," Juarez said. "Then every day we come to change money here, and 
that's how we live. If not, you lose everything." 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Piano, co-owner of one of Argentina's largest currency-exchange 
companies, said that people are bringing whatever australs they can muster, 
often worth as little as $20 or $30, and lining up to buy "greens," as dollars 
are known. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes workers pool their resources to buy a few dollars and share the 
profit. In fact, the dollar market may be Argentina's only growth industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an infernal job for us," Piano said. "We have 2,000 customers per day, 
double the number a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Brazil and most other Latin American countries, where disparities 
between the few rich and the many poor are immense, Argentina has always had a 
large middle class. But the hyper-inflation is widening the gap between 
Argentines with access to dollars and those without -- a potentially dangerous 
trend in a country with a history of military coups in response to economic 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Many middle-class Argentines have stashed dollars under the mattress or opened 
bank accounts illegally in Uruguay or Miami. Now some are cashing in those 
dollars to weather the inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason that a middle class still exists in Argentina," Piano said, 
"is that people began acquiring dollars years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Fabio, a dealer on Rio de Janeiro's illegal but widely tolerated black market 
in dollars, said that U.S. currency also is a good hedge against inflation in 
Brazil. Fabio and other black marketeers even give many customers the added 
service of telexing deposits of newly purchased dollars to money-market 
accounts in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But only better-off Brazilians have extra cash these days for investing in U.S. 
currency, Fabio said. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, from the lower middle class down they aren't in a situation to invest 
in anything," he said. "They really don't have money." 
</P>
<P>
Jamim Merence, a Rio de Janeiro handyman, said he must buy paint, cement and 
other materials on the same day he submits an estimate for a job -- or run the 
risk of budget-breaking price increases. 
</P>
<P>
He collects half of the payment for a job before he starts and the other half 
when he finishes, but inflation can erode his profits before he receives the 
second payment if the job takes two or three weeks, as the painting of a 
three-bedroom apartment recently did. 
</P>
<P>
"When I took the job, the price I quoted seemed very good," Merence said. "When 
I finished 20 days later, I took a big loss." 
</P>
<P>
More inflation-savvy businessmen avoid such losses. In Argentina, down payments 
are made at current austral prices, and later payments are usually actualized 
to reflect the austral's deterioration against the dollar. In Brazil, virtually 
all values in the formal economy are "indexed," readjusted periodically to keep 
pace with cost-of-living indexes. 
</P>
<P>
Rio dentist Ronald Penido makes all work estimates in BTNs, or National 
Treasury Bonds, rather than in cruzados, the official currency. After making 
one estimate in February, he reminded a patient before beginning work in March, 
"Of course the BTN value in cruzados has changed." It had jumped from 17.1 
cruzados in February to 29.5 cruzados in March. 
</P>
<P>
The BTN is widely used for indexing rents, time payments, insurance premiums 
and other values. 
</P>
<P>
Many Brazilian stores mark consumer goods with letter and number codes to 
represent constant values rather than trying to keep up with changing price 
tags. In bookstores, many price tags are in the real livro, a quasi-monetary 
unit adopted by about 25 Brazilian publishers. 
</P>
<P>
Every week, the publishers' association sends out a notice giving the real 
livro's value in cruzados. Other publishers do the same with their own units or 
codes. As a result, bookstore browsers must ask a clerk for the price of each 
book, and clerks must make conversions on calculators. 
</P>
<P>
"When three customers are here at once, you might have to wait a while for a 
price," said Ernani da Silva, a salesman in a bookstore in Rio's Leblon 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Deposits in Brazilian savings accounts are indexed monthly, and short-term 
deposits in the "overnight" money market are readjusted each day. Many 
middle-class Brazilians keep their money in the "overnight," transferring cash 
to their checking accounts only when checks must be covered. At the beginning 
of the month, when many bills are due, banks' telephones are swamped with calls 
requesting fund transfers. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it takes half an hour to get through to the bank," said Salomao 
Quadros da Silva, a university professor. 
</P>
<P>
Brazilian wages are increased every month by the same percentage as the 
official cost of living index. But raises lag behind the index, and salaries 
cannot keep up with quickly climbing inflation. Unions are constantly demanding 
special raises to make up for losses in real wages, often calling strikes to 
back the demands. 
</P>
<P>
Almost no one can truly keep up, and life styles are changing in both Brazil 
and Argentina. The number of tourists in Argentina's Mar del Plata seaside 
resort fell 30% in February, and those who came spent a fraction of what they 
spent in the past. 
</P>
<P>
One Argentine hardship joke has a doctor asking his patient why he took only 
one of his prescribed pills per day. The patient answers, "But doctor, you told 
me to take one after each meal." 
</P>
<P>
Middle-class Brazilians used to beat inflation by making purchases with credit 
cards. When credit card bills came due up to a month after the purchase, the 
cost to the consumer was reduced in effect by the amount of monthly inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"No one paid cash," said Alexandre Moura, a salesman at the Bill Brothers 
clothing store in the Rio Sul shopping center. But in recent months, Brazilian 
stores have raised prices for credit-card purchases by as much as -- or more 
than -- a month's inflation. 
</P>
<P>
At Bill Brothers, for example, prices to customers who pay with credit cards 
are exactly double the prices for those who pay with cash or check. Now, 
credit-card purchases are "very, very rare," Moura said. Most restaurants no 
longer accept credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
At the Freeway supermarket in Rio's middle-class suburb of Barra de Tijuca, 
almost all customers still use credit cards to pay for groceries. Angelo 
Maldonado Dias, waiting at the checkout counter with his two small daughters, 
acknowledged there is no longer any advantage because Freeway prices are 90% to 
100% higher than those of nearby supermarkets. But he added, "The problem is, 
we are short on cash, so we have to use the card." 
</P>
<P>
Dias, 33, said his salary as a computer programmer has been so eroded by 
inflation that he no longer has money to take his family to a restaurant or on 
a weekend excursion. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't enough to buy clothes for the children," he said. "There isn't 
enough for any entertainment, none. Our entertainment is going to the 
supermarket." 
</P>
<P>
The money problems can cause marital problems, he added: "Relations between 
husband and wife are shaky, tense. You want to buy something, but there isn't 
any money." 
</P>
<P>
Still, some imaginative South Americans have found techniques to use inflation 
to their advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Aldo Listre, 35, the owner of a shop selling used books and magazines in the 
Argentine mountain resort town of Carlos Paz, put up a sign in his window 
saying, "I accept dollars." Vacationers were bringing dollars to maintain their 
buying power and changing the dollars locally. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure if they have small bills left over, they can come here and buy a 
book," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And Hector Toani, who runs a family car-battery factory in Carlos Paz, said: 
"We are calculating prices directly in dollars. If we don't, it's impossible to 
make any calculations. We accept dollars or the equivalent in australs. If 
prices are rising every day, to put them in dollars is the only way to cover 
oneself. Nevertheless, we are selling much less than before -- 70% to 80% 
less." 
</P>
<P>
In the working-class suburbs on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, there are 
neither dollars nor jobs these days. It was in these barrios where the rioting 
occurred last year. Common crime is also increasing. 
</P>
<P>
In Tres de Febrero, Salvador Zeoli sells cigarettes and candy at a kiosk he 
built onto the front of his house, facing a ragged neighborhood square. He 
pointed across the street to a house cleaned out by armed robbers the previous 
week and described another robbery around the corner the day before. He blamed 
the general economic breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
An Italian immigrant who came to Argentina 40 years ago, Zeoli said he was 
proud to have driven his own car for the last 22 years. Six months ago, he put 
it in the garage. He simply could not afford the hyper-inflated gasoline 
prices. Zeoli and his wife get around by bicycle, although, he conceded, 
"bicycle parts have also shot up lately." 
</P>
<P>
He is the only kiosk owner in the neighborhood who still sells cigarettes, a 
product that has been especially hard hit by inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"First my suppliers raised the price of cigarettes 50%, then 6%, then another 
77%, all in less than three weeks," Zeoli said. "That meant I had to sell three 
packs just to be able to buy one new pack for the shelves." 
</P>
<P>
A customer and friend of Zeoli shuffled to the kiosk's barred window and bought 
a single cigarette. He was a plumber and unemployed, Zeoli said. 
</P>
<P>
"We never used to sell one cigarette at a time like that," he said. "Maybe it's 
better that the people aren't poisoning themselves with smoking, but they are 
poisoning themselves with the tensions these days of just trying to survive."

REPUBLICANS TOSS A GRAND OLD CONVENTION; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: DELEGATES PLAY DOWN THEIR DIFFERENCES AND PLAY UP WHAT UNITES THEM -- 
THE BATTLE TO GAIN CONTROL OVER THE LEGISLATURE.

<P>
If you are a loyal Republican, walked your precincts, licked all those 
envelopes, slaved at the phone banks on Election Day -- this is your reward. A 
weekend of politics at the state Republican Party convention. The harvest of 
the grass roots. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates began arriving Friday and by Saturday numbered 900 for this ritual 
held twice a year. Reporters, consultants, operatives and politicians pushed 
the total participation to perhaps 1,200 or more -- to hear the ballyhoos of a 
party with growing hopes of attaining majorityhood, but still uneasy with 
anything that alters its old-fashioned conservative principles. 
</P>
<P>
Most Californians know of state political conventions as simple platforms at 
some remote hotel where office and publicity seekers speak over the heads of 
the delegates, through the news media, to voters at large. In other words, a 
hot air show. 
</P>
<P>
But for delegates, this is Democracy in full flourish -- for better or worse, 
and sometimes both. This is what Democracy looks like 200-plus years after a 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how you got started in politics. You go to a meeting. Your reward is 
you get invited back to another meeting. . . . Pretty soon, you're in charge," 
state Sen. Marian Bergeson said by way of tribute to the delegates. Many of 
whom said it took up to five years of work to get this far. 
</P>
<P>
From the vantage point of the rank and file, the convention is part social, 
part personal -- but always political. 
</P>
<P>
"Without these gatherings, you get the blahs," said longtime Laguna Niguel 
activist Dorothy Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
Friday was the day when the leaders of the state GOP, chiefly Chairman Frank 
Visco, a good-natured Lancaster insurance man, tried to establish the tone for 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the effort was to try and channel the energy of the delegates away 
from internal squabbles about those issues that divide Republicans -- and 
toward a matter that unites them: reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
Visco and the party announced that they had budgeted $400,000 for television 
commercials to support a pair of June ballot initiatives -- Propositions 118 
and 119 -- to stop Democratic control over the drawing of legislative and 
congressional districts. One initiative would establish a commission to draw 
districts, the other would require a two-thirds vote of the Legislature instead 
of a simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
The GOP argues that majority Democrats have gerrymandered lines unfairly to 
concentrate Republicans in the fewest number of districts. This results in 
Democrats "unfairly" having 60% of the congressional seats. Visco said if 
either Proposition 118 or 119 passed and resulted in the "fair" drawing of 
district lines, the Republicans would have up to 60% of the seats. 
</P>
<P>
One of the highlights of the convention occurred later Friday night -- a forum 
for 16 of the party's candidates for statewide office, from lieutenant governor 
down. It was an unusual mix of the obscure, the serious, the odd and 
unexpected, as candidates scrambled to say something compelling about 
themselves in a brief allotment of time. 
</P>
<P>
John Harden is one of those little-known candidates unbothered by having to 
pander for votes. A La Habra claims adjuster, he is running for insurance 
commissioner under the terms of the 1988 insurance revolt initiative, 
Proposition 103. Harden will take the office, all right, but as for Proposition 
103: "It's a hysterical group of people getting together about something of 
which they know nothing!" he huffed. 
</P>
<P>
For those who say politicians never have any new ideas there was insurance 
commissioner candidate John Parise, a soft-spoken insurance lawyer. He proposed 
a 20-cent increase of the gasoline tax to provide basic insurance for all 
motorists -- a low paper work fee directly tied to the amount of driving a 
person does. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores figured everyone in California would 
like to spend more of their lives involved with politics, just like the 
delegates. She said that if elected California's secretary of state, she would 
lead the way to televise proceedings of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in Moscow, debates of the government get No. 1 ratings. Where is the 
leadership here?" she demanded. 
</P>
<P>
Her rival, conservative Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Gordon Levy, tried the 
politics of confrontation. Not with her, but with the delegates. He listed all 
the lawyers running for office, and added with a snarl, "And I'm a lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd booed enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
The party's two lieutenant governor candidates were given a chance to debate 
face to face. Although both scored points with supporters as they recounted 
their views, Sen. Bergeson bested Sen. John Seymour on the matter of memorable 
one-liners, or sound bites. 
</P>
<P>
On the question of drugs, Bergeson won when she emphasized that she is against 
legalization. Period. "Read my lipstick!" 
</P>
<P>
Seymour lost with his explanation of political leadership. "Leadership is the 
ability to stand up and be counted when it counts." 
</P>
<P>
Delegates then broke for a giant lobby party at the Santa Clara Marriott, which 
lasted long into Saturday morning. There was no allowance for hangovers at this 
convention, however. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:30 a.m. delegates were threading past hawkers selling buttons and 
conservative books, past an anti-abortion booth with graphic displays of 
fetuses, past all kinds of pamphleteers, to hear a 40-minute wake-up speech 
from U.S. Housing and Urban Affairs Secretary Jack Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
A favorite of conservatives, Kemp was invited to attend the convention in an 
effort to generate some excitement on the party's right flank for its moderate 
nominee-apparent for governor, Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Wilson acknowledged that not just conservatives but some 
important agribusiness leaders are expressing early discontent with his 
campaign. Agricultural interests worry that he is trying too hard to please 
environmentalists on state regulation of pesticides. They are trying to nudge 
him back into their corner. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a two-term U.S. senator, said farmers would come to see that he is 
acting in their long-term interest by proposing the creation of a state 
environmental protection agency. 
</P>
<P>
The most ubiquitous figure at the convention was former Rep. Dan Lungren. He 
officially announced his candidacy for attorney general with a record four 
speeches in less than 18 hours at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates had to look harder, to peer behind the scenes, to watch some of the 
politics that party leaders wanted to de-emphasize at this convention. Abortion 
is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the national Republican Party, the California GOP is officially silent 
on the touchy question. Its candidates are deeply divided -- from Pete Wilson, 
who is strongly in favor of a woman's right to choose an abortion, to Lungren, 
who is just as strongly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
This is just the kind of fight some delegates like to stir up, but Visco and 
other party officials strived to defuse it. "We're leaning more toward becoming 
an umbrella party rather than one of single issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said party leaders are seeking a compromise abortion plank in the 1990 
platform that "everyone is happy with." 
</P>
<P>
But wouldn't such a statement have to be bland and meaningless? Visco was 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"That," he said cheerfully, "is exactly what we're hoping for."

SETTLEMENT OF COUNTY REMAP SUIT UNLIKELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum's decision not to seek reelection is unlikely to lead 
to an immediate settlement in the multimillion dollar redistricting lawsuit 
against Los Angeles County, officials close to the case said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But they agreed that Schabarum's move will make it far easier to redraw the 
district lines if the county loses in court. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, Schabarum's ideological opposite on the 
board, said he will press for a settlement, but others suggested that is 
doubtful unless U.S. District Judge David Kenyon orders the parties into 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not be overly optimistic at this point on settlement," Supervisor Ed 
Edelman said. "I think it is a little late in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Only a few weeks remain in the trial, which began in early January. The suit 
was brought by the U.S. Justice Department, the Mexican-American Legal Defense 
and Educational Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union. The plaintiffs 
charge that the county supervisors intentionally split the Latino community 
into three districts in 1981 in order to dilute their voting power. If the 
county loses in court, the lines are expected to be redrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum did not file for reelection by Friday, the deadline for incumbents. 
The political ramifications of his decision continued to be felt Saturday as 
potential candidates met with supporters and discussed whether to enter the 
race. The filing deadline was extended until Wednesday, but by late Saturday no 
additional candidates had filed nomination papers for the race. 
</P>
<P>
With the balance of power in the now conservative-dominated board riding on the 
election, both Democrats and Republicans were lobbying their favorites to enter 
the race. The upcoming election gives Democrats their best shot at holding 
three seats on the five-member board since the Republicans, led by Schabarum, 
took control in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Both plaintiffs and defendants on Saturday suggested that the trial will 
continue unless Kenyon reopens settlement talks. 
</P>
<P>
The judge could not be reached for comment Saturday. But when the trial began, 
Kenyon said he would not entertain any settlement discussions, and plaintiffs' 
attorneys said Saturday that they expect him to maintain that position. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position has always been that we would be willing to entertain settlement 
discussions," said Richard Fajardo, a MALDEF attorney. "The problem right now 
is that I'm not sure the judge is going to entertain discussions." 
</P>
<P>
Among board members, there was disagreement Saturday about what course to take. 
</P>
<P>
While Hahn favored settling the case by redrawing the lines "in order to save 
the taxpayers' money," Supervisor Deane Dana said he would not go along with 
any such move. 
</P>
<P>
But there was nearly unanimous agreement that if the county loses the case, it 
will be easier to redraw the lines, because supervisors will not have to worry 
about offending a colleague. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn agreed, pointing out that settlement talks collapsed last December after 
Schabarum objected to a redistricting plan that would have placed him in a new, 
predominantly Latino district. 
</P>
<P>
"The argument before was (that drawing new lines) would jeopardize Schabarum," 
said ACLU attorney Mark Rosenbaum. "That is no longer an issue." 
</P>
<P>
Dana predicted that if a Latino is elected in the the upcoming contest, the 
lawsuit could be a moot point. But the plaintiffs and officials representing 
the larger Latino community insisted that the lines must be redrawn. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem isn't who the representative of the First District is," Fajardo 
said. "The question is what does the First District look like. The basic 
problem of fragmenting the Hispanic community is still there." 
</P>
<P>
Under the current lines, the district, which covers the San Gabriel Valley and 
some of the southeastern part of Los Angeles County, is 41% Republican and 50% 
Democrat. But in the past, the district has largely voted Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, without a strong incumbent, Republicans are fearful that they may 
lose the seat and thus control of the board. 
</P>
<P>
Dana said Schabarum's closely held, last-minute decision prevented other 
Republicans from lining up for the seat. "The normal thing to do, as a courtesy 
to the party, is to bow out early," he said. "I am concerned about one thing -- 
maintaining the conservative majority." 
</P>
<P>
Prominent Latino Democrats were meeting this weekend to try to consolidate 
behind one person and thus avoid a fragmented effort. Among those considering a 
bid are U.S. Rep. Esteban Torres (D-Pico Rivera) and Los Angeles City Council 
members Richard Alatorre and Gloria Molina. 
</P>
<P>
But Molina and Alatorre apparently could not run unless the lines are redrawn, 
because they live outside the current district, associates said. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans also were scrambling for support Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most frequently mentioned was Sarah Flores, a Schabarum deputy who 
worked her way up through the county bureaucracy to become assistant chief 
deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Current and former elected officials also were weighing in. Dr. Forest Tennant, 
a Republican, the former West Covina mayor who runs a string of medical clinics 
and has had a controversial tenure as the National Football League's drug 
adviser, said he was considering the race. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Greg O'Brien, appointed to the Municipal Court in 1984 and 
raised to the Superior Court in 1988, also has been mentioned as a potential 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Several San Gabriel Valley mayors -- Terry Dipple of San Dimas, Don McMillan of 
El Monte and Donna Smith of Pomona -- also were among those being touted for 
the supervisor's seat. 
</P>
<P>
It is also possible that Judge Kenyon could grant the Justice Department's 
request to delay the June 5 supervisors' election until a new redistricting 
plan can be drafted. If districts are realigned, Schabarum could conceivably 
run in a new district, ACLU attorney Rosenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum has refused to discuss his plans before a news conference Monday.

Mayor Teddy Kollek on Saturday blamed recent statements by President Bush for 
raising tensions in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Both Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III said in the last 10 days 
that Israel's policy of settling Jews in the occupied lands, including Arab 
East Jerusalem, is an impediment to peace. 
</P>
<P>
Kollek called Bush's remarks untimely and unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel offended by the lack of knowledge about what is going on here on the 
part of very important people who are our friends (but) who have no idea what's 
happening," the mayor said on Israel Radio.

A British-based journalist who had been investigating reports of a mysterious 
explosion at a weapons complex near Baghdad was sentenced to death Saturday by 
an Iraqi revolutionary court that found him guilty of spying. 
</P>
<P>
Farzad Bazoft, a stateless Iranian exile working for Britain's weekly Observer 
newspaper, was sentenced after a five-hour, closed-door trial that also 
resulted in the conviction of a 52-year-old British nurse charged with helping 
Bazoft. 
</P>
<P>
The nurse, Daphne Parish, accused of driving Bazoft to the weapons facility 40 
miles south of Baghdad, was sentenced to 15 years in prison. An unidentified 
Iraqi also charged in the case received a 10-year sentence for communicating 
government secrets to a foreigner, according to the British Foreign Office. 
</P>
<P>
The sentences drew a swift and outraged response from the British government, 
which monitored the trial and complained that no evidence was produced to 
warrant the sentences. 
</P>
<P>
"We utterly deplore these harsh and excessive sentences. . . . They come ill 
from a regime which is trying to show a more liberal face to the world," the 
Foreign Office said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has come under repeated criticism from human rights organizations, which 
in recent months have reported that abuses ranging from arbitrary arrests to 
torture and political executions persist in Iraq despite President Saddam 
Hussein's recent moves toward political reform. 
</P>
<P>
Observer editor Donald Trelford, in a statement Saturday, described the 
sentences as "barbaric and unjust" and called for Britain to withdraw its 
ambassador from Baghdad and cancel offers of export credit to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"The Observer proclaims the innocence of its reporter, who was only doing his 
job," Trelford said. 
</P>
<P>
Bazoft, 32, an Iranian native who had lived in Britain for several years and 
traveled with British documents, was arrested at Baghdad airport Sept. 15 after 
what his editors said was a working visit to Iraq at the invitation of the 
Iraqi government. 
</P>
<P>
While in Iraq, Bazoft, who had worked for the Observer since 1986, investigated 
reports of an Aug. 17 explosion at the huge Al Iskandaria military complex. 
Another British newspaper, the Independent, said the blast resulted in as many 
as 700 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis described the incident as a relatively minor explosion at a fuel 
depot that killed only 19. 
</P>
<P>
Bazoft had befriended Parish, a senior nursing administrator for the Irish-run 
Ibn al Bitar hospital in Baghdad, according to British news accounts, and the 
nurse was subsequently accused of driving Bazoft to the plant where the 
explosion allegedly occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Two months after his arrest, Bazoft, looking exhausted and strained, appeared 
on Iraqi television and confessed to being an Israeli agent. In a subsequent 
meeting with British consular officials, he continued to proclaim his 
innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Even before formal charges were brought, Iraq's official newspapers accused 
Bazoft of spying for Britain and shrugged off Western criticism of the arrests. 
"What is Iraq to do?" the daily Al Iraq asked. "Offer him sweets and give him 
an official send-off at the airport? Iraq is not a garden of the house of 
Maggie, or a part of the British empire." 
</P>
<P>
But the Observer said Bazoft had sought official permission to visit the 
military complex, had told the newspaper's foreign desk of his movements and 
talked openly about the visit to his colleagues upon his return to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
"None of this conduct is consistent with espionage. It is entirely consistent 
with journalism," Trelford said. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Press Assn. news service reported that British officials have already 
forwarded a request for clemency on behalf of Bazoft and Parish. The Iraqi 
ambassador in London was summoned to the Foreign Office to be told of the 
government's "utter dismay" at the sentences, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Iraqi law, no appeal of the sentences is permitted.

SOVIETS WARY OF POWERFUL U.S.-STYLE PRESIDENCY; 
</P>
<P>
REFORMS: SOME FEAR THE NEW SYSTEM WON'T ESTABLISH CHECKS AND BALANCES TO BAR 
THE RISE OF A DICTATOR.

<P>
The Soviet Union, after years of disdainfully rejecting Western models, is 
fashioning its revamped presidency in part on the American chief executive. But 
political scientists warn that special precautions are needed to prevent a 
repeat of Russian history: the emergence of oppressive one-man rule. 
</P>
<P>
Experts who helped draft the constitutional amendments concerning the office of 
Soviet president, which is likely to be approved by the Congress of People's 
Deputies this week, note that many of the proposed powers match those held by 
the President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But because the upheaval in Soviet politics over the last several months has 
left the entire parliamentary system in flux, some warn that presidents under 
the new system could take advantage of the confusion to become omnipotent. 
Lawmakers, still unpracticed in democracy, might be unable to prevent such a 
sweep to tyrannical rule, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed powers, which experts say might permit a dictatorship in the absence 
of proper checks and balances, include the right of the president to issue a 
decree "binding on the entire territory of the country" and to unilaterally 
declare a state of emergency in a republic. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not enough to clarify what powers the president should have," said 
Victor I. Borisyuk, a chief adviser at the U.S.A. and Canada Institute, an 
academic institution in Moscow. "In fact, by itself, this is a mistake and will 
not create stability for us. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to clarify several other things at the same time, primarily what 
exactly will be the powers and relationship between the various institutions 
intended to balance the president," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear, Borisyuk and other political specialists note, which 
powers should be wielded by the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies, the 
smaller Supreme Soviet whose members are elected from among the Congress' 
deputies, and the local parliaments in each of the country's 15 republics. 
</P>
<P>
So the organs are likely to compete with each other and fail to act as a check 
on presidential powers. 
</P>
<P>
"While (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev might not abuse the powers, who knows what will 
happen next year or even next month, or who will come after him?" Borisyuk 
said. Gorbachev is widely expected to be chosen as the first president. 
</P>
<P>
The constitutional articles on the presidency to be considered by the Congress 
of People's Deputies provide for some powers clearly based on those held by the 
American president. 
</P>
<P>
* The president is to be elected initially by the Congress but thereafter by 
popular secret ballot. He will serve for no more than two five-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
* The president will be able both to veto a bill outright -- requiring a 
two-thirds majority in the Supreme Soviet to override that veto -- or to use 
the equivalent of the American pocket veto to kill a bill simply by refusing to 
sign it during the legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
* The president will have the power to commute death sentences, negotiate 
treaties and represent the country abroad. 
</P>
<P>
* The president will appoint all top government and military posts and also 
will have the power to remove appointees. 
</P>
<P>
Several proposed presidential powers have been opposed by nationalists in the 
Baltic and Caucasian republics and by progressive deputies who have formed an 
Inter-Regional Group that acts as a political opposition. Both the deputies and 
political scientists stress that the country must keep in mind abuses of power 
both by Russian czars and Soviet leaders. 
</P>
<P>
For centuries, Russians and visitors to the country have described governments 
that held inordinate sway over the governed. In 1839, for instance, French 
nobleman Marquis de Custine visited Russia and described "the blind submission" 
of the people to Czar Nicholas I. 
</P>
<P>
In 1936 the French writer Andre Gide echoed his countryman in describing 
Soviets during Josef Stalin's bloody rule. He wrote that an all-powerful 
government was seeking total compliance and conformity from the people, and 
"what is most astounding is that this attempt is successful." 
</P>
<P>
"We have in our history no democratic tradition, no democratic mentality," said 
Borisyuk. "The idea of a strong central power is deeply rooted in our past, and 
many, many people still want a strong symbol of power. We must beware." 
</P>
<P>
Several articles in the proposed amendments have elicited concern: 
</P>
<P>
* The president is called upon to take "all the necessary measures to protect 
the . . . territorial integrity of the country." Nationalists warn this could 
give the president the authority to oversee a crackdown against republics 
seeking to secede from the union, a right which is theoretically guaranteed by 
the constitution. Strong pro-independence movements exist in the Baltic 
republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, as well as in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
* The president has the right to declare a state of emergency in any locality, 
after simply advising the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the republic in 
question. This was intended specifically to help the president combat the rise 
in ethnic conflict which has troubled most of the country's 15 republics. But 
critics have warned it could easily be abused. 
</P>
<P>
* If there is discord between the two houses of the Supreme Soviet that the 
president cannot settle, he can dissolve the body. The ambiguous language of 
the article could, in theory, permit a president to simply dismiss a 
legislature that was effectively acting as a check on his powers. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to beef up the influence of the Supreme Soviet so it can act as a 
balance to presidential powers, Borisyuk and several other specialists have 
called for the outright dissolution of the Congress of People's Deputies, 
arguing that it has become an unwieldy institution and is diluting the 
authority of the Supreme Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
The Congress, to which representatives were elected from across the country, 
"was, just months ago, our main hope," acknowledged Vladimir A. Toumanov of the 
Soviet Academy of Political Sciences, an adviser on the constitutional changes 
regarding the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
"But times are changing with such rapidity we can already see it is slowing 
change and hampering our development into a real democracy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Toumanov argued that the Soviet Union needs a strong president to deal with 
unprecedented problems -- such as ethnic strife and the stoicism of 
middle-level bureaucrats who have blocked many of Gorbachev's efforts to 
implement economic change. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation in the country right now is very dangerous, and that is why we 
are in a hurry to create a strong president," agreed Alexander Darchiyev, 
another expert at the U.S.A. and Canada Institute. "But at the same time I 
would like to see a strong system, not just a strong president." 
</P>
<P>
"We need, in fact, to make our parliament stronger than the American 
parliament, so the people can learn through the parliament a new idea for the 
Soviet Union -- the idea of political pluralism and tolerance."

MILITARY CHIEF SENDS LESOTHO KING TO TEMPORARY EXILE

<P>
King Moshoeshoe II, stripped of authority over his tiny mountain kingdom, left 
for temporary exile in Britain on Saturday after refusing to endorse the 
actions of Lesotho's military ruler in a recent power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Justin Lekhanya said in a radio broadcast that he had asked 
Moshoeshoe, 51, to take "a brief sabbatical in the United Kingdom, which would 
allow ample opportunity for reflection." 
</P>
<P>
Lekhanya, who led a bloodless coup in 1986 and heads a six-member ruling 
military council, took away the king's powers of assent after he opposed 
Lekhanya's attempts to oust several members of the council who were accused of 
insubordination and obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
The general said in his broadcast that he escorted the king to the frontier to 
board a plane from South Africa, which surrounds Lesotho. A source close to the 
events said Moshoeshoe took a chartered flight to Botswana for a connecting 
flight to London. He may take up residence at either Oxford University, where 
he studied previously, or Sweden's University of Uppsala. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that Moshoeshoe has gone into exile. Moshoeshoe fled in 
1970 in another crisis when he was reduced to a figurehead role by Prime 
Minister Leabua Jonathan, who was himself ousted in the 1986 coup. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan's downfall was prompted by a land blockade by South Africa, which 
crippled Lesotho's economy. The military council headed by Lekhanya restored 
close relations with South Africa.

AFTER 20 YEARS, VIETNAM VETERAN GETS BRONZE STAR

Jim Lahr sat ramrod straight in his wheelchair, tears welling in his eyes as 
his field commander in Vietnam added a long-delayed Bronze Star on Saturday to 
the rows of medals pinned to his Marine uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"The good guys finally won one," said Col. Donald Meyers, who retired from the 
Corps less than two years ago. "It doesn't happen very often." 
</P>
<P>
While on patrol in Vietnam on March 21, 1969, 16 days before the end of his 
13-month tour of duty, Lahr and several other Marines descended the steep banks 
of a stream to fill canteens. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out they had stumbled on a huge North Vietnamese supply cache, said 
Denver Lawson Freeman, who probably would have died there if it were not for 
Lahr. As they stooped in the 2-foot-deep water, they were ambushed with machine 
gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole hill basically just exploded," Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
A grenade fell nearby, wounding Freeman and several others. 
</P>
<P>
"Cpl. Lahr, with complete disregard for his own safety, . . . assisted several 
Marines to safety," the award citation says. "Despite the heavy fire, he made 
several trips . . . until he himself was wounded and unable to continue." 
</P>
<P>
Lahr said he took one round from a rifle. The bullet went into his shoulder, 
grazed his lung, hit three ribs and then lodged in his spine, paralyzing him 
from the waist down. 
</P>
<P>
For 20 years, neither Freeman nor Lahr knew that the other had survived. 
</P>
<P>
But through a contact he made at a Marine Corps reunion last summer, Freeman, 
of South Charleston, W. Va., learned that Lahr was living in Lincoln, Ill. He 
set out to see that his friend received the honor he deserved. 
</P>
<P>
"If he had not pulled me out of the river that day, I wouldn't be here today," 
Freeman said after the ceremony at the Marine Reserve base.

Harlem residents fed up with billboards enticing them to buy alcohol and 
cigarettes splashed paint over more than a dozen of the signs Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Singing "Yield Not to Temptation," about 50 members of the Abyssinian Baptist 
Church marched with buckets and paint rollers down a street in Harlem, a 
section of New York where a recent study found that black men have shorter life 
spans than men in Bangladesh. 
</P>
<P>
"Alcohol kills more people than heroin, marijuana, crack and cocaine together," 
said the Rev. Calvin O. Butts, the protest organizer and church pastor. It was 
the group's second swing through Harlem in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Butts said billboards advertising such products as whiskey and cigarettes 
"proliferate in the African-American community more than any other community," 
often degrade women and are designed to entice youths. 
</P>
<P>
John Brown, vice president of Metropolitan Outdoor Advertising, announced 
Saturday that his company, one of the biggest distributors of small billboards 
in the United States, would remove liquor and cigarette billboards within 5 
blocks of places of worship, schools and play areas in New York.

Homeless advocate Mitch Snyder, whose 51-day fast in 1984 forced the Ronald 
Reagan Administration to allocate funds for the homeless, launched another 
hunger strike Saturday in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder began his fast at noon and was joined by 21 members of his Community for 
Creative Non-Violence homeless advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
The organization is protesting a District of Columbia committee's plan to cut 
the department budget that funds shelters and other services to homeless 
families by one-third this year and by nearly one-half next year. 
</P>
<P>
The committee voted Friday to cut the department's budget by $19 million over 
the next two years. The action will be voted on by the district's council March 
20. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder, 46, vowed to "do whatever is necessary" to change the committee's 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
Starting Monday, the group of fasters will take turns demonstrating in front of 
City Hall, he said. Snyder said he was unsure whether the group would continue 
to fast if the committee's actions were sustained by the council.

SELMA MARCHERS HOPE FOR NEW ACTIVISM

<P>
The re-enactment of the historic 50-mile march from Selma to Montgomery ended 
Saturday with 3,000 people gathered in the shadow of Alabama's Capitol to 
rekindle the spirit of the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1965 march, 25,000 people gathered in "the Cradle of the Confederacy" to 
demand voting rights; organizers hoped the 1990 trek would herald a new age of 
activism. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a shameful waste if we marched all the way from Selma to 
Montgomery to go home and sit on our seats of apathy," said Joseph Lowery, 
president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, who led the weeklong 
commemorative march. 
</P>
<P>
At the Capitol, where the Confederate battle flag flies over the dome despite 
blacks' protests, the Rev. Jesse Jackson told the chanting crowd that their 
message must be taken to the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
"On to Washington for jobs," Jackson exhorted the gathering. "On to Washington 
for peace dividends. Keep hope alive." 
</P>
<P>
Coretta Scott King encouraged the mostly black crowd to keep fighting for 
racial equality. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the faithful few, and God always uses those who are willing to be 
used," said the widow of slain civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., 
whose first church is a block down the street from the Capitol steps. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. King, Jackson and others said blacks had made progress but much remained 
to be done. Lowery called for corporations "to engage in equitable reinvestment 
in our communities." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson later went to meet with former Gov. George C. Wallace at his home. 
Wallace, who opposed the 1965 march, later won widespread black support that 
helped win his fourth and final term as governor in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"If the governor can come from where he was 20 years ago and speak of a moral 
society where there is economic justice, there is hope for blacks and whites 
alike," Jackson said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The rally capped a week in which about 150 marchers crossed the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge in Selma and headed east along a rural highway to Montgomery, covering 
the path activists took in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
The march 25 years ago came two weeks after "Bloody Sunday," when white 
authorities routed black marchers with clubs and tear gas as they tried to 
cross the bridge over the Alabama River. 
</P>
<P>
The violence at Selma was recorded by television cameras and helped spur 
Congress to pass the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which guaranteed ballot box rights 
for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
In Alabama, black voter registration increased from about 92,000 in 1964 to 
nearly 250,000 in 1967. And nationwide, the number of black elected officials 
leaped from 103 in 1964 to 7,226 today.

NUCLEAR WEAPON DETONATED; 2 PROTESTERS HELD

YUCCA FLAT, Nev. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A nuclear weapon was detonated 1,500 feet beneath the Nevada desert Saturday, 
generating the force of a moderate earthquake that was felt by some observers 
on high-rise gambling resorts 85 miles away in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The test, code-named "Metropolis," was the first nuclear test announced by the 
United States this year. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven anti-nuclear protesters held a vigil near the gates of the Nevada Test 
Site, 30 miles from where the weapon was triggered beneath Yucca Flat, an arid 
desert flat on the Nevada Test Site. 
</P>
<P>
Two men were arrested on charges of trespassing when they stepped over the 
government property line at the top-secret Department of Energy facility. 
Eighteen protesters briefly picketed the Department of Energy building in 
downtown Las Vegas without incident. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said the 
nuclear blast measured 5.1, a magnitude equivalent to a "moderate" earthquake. 
The recent Upland earthquake in Southern California had a magnitude of 5.5. 
</P>
<P>
Chris West, a spokesman for the Department of Energy, said government observers 
on the high-rise Fitzgerald's hotel-casino in downtown Las Vegas reported 
feeling "a slight earth motion" but were unable to determine the direction of 
the earth movement. 
</P>
<P>
Observers at the high-rise Regency Towers, a posh condominium on the Las Vegas 
Country Club near the Strip, also felt slight motion. 
</P>
<P>
There were no other reports of earth motion and no damage, West said. 
</P>
<P>
The detonation at 8 a.m. PST had a yield of 20 to 150 kilotons, or a maximum 
equivalent of 150,000 tons of TNT. The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during 
World War II was a 13-kiloton weapon. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials announced 12 underground nuclear weapons tests last year at the 
Nevada Test Site, six of which were in the 20 to 150 kiloton range. 
</P>
<P>
"No radiation escaped into the atmosphere and initial data indicates the test 
was a success," West said. 
</P>
<P>
He described the earth motion from a control point 11 miles from ground zero as 
similar to "sitting in a rowboat and gently rocking back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
"There were no problems. Everything went fine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The detonation sent a funnel of dust into the clear desert sky above ground 
zero, as the earth bulged skyward about a foot from the force of the 
underground detonation. 
</P>
<P>
Helicopters and fixed-wing government planes circled above ground zero with 
radiation monitoring equipment, prepared to track any radiation that might leak 
into the atmosphere by accident. 
</P>
<P>
The nuclear weapons test, conducted by the Livermore National Laboratory, was 
the 700th at the Nevada Test Site since the Rhode Island-sized facility became 
operational in 1951.

Dana Wilkerson drove the length of the court and hit a shot from the lane with 
two seconds left, lifting Cal State Long Beach to an 85-83 victory over Pacific 
Saturday in a semifinal game of the Big West Conference women's basketball 
tournament at Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific's Julie Szukalski, a 6-foot-3 senior center, scored a tournament-record 
40 points, but the Tigers' bid for a second consecutive upset fell just short. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific (15-15) beat 12th-ranked Hawaii Thursday, and came back after trailing 
13th-ranked Long Beach by nine at halftime to tie the score with 10 seconds 
left on a layup by Szukalski. 
</P>
<P>
Szukalski made 15 of 22 shots, and 10 of 12 free throws. She also had 18 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Penny Moore scored 24 points for Long Beach. Trise Jackson added 16 and 
Angelique Lee had 15. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers' victory, the 300th of Coach Joan Bonvicini's career, sends Long 
Beach (24-7) into the tournament final today against top-seeded Nevada Las 
Vegas. ROBYN NORWOOD

UNLV CRUSHES PACIFIC, PREPARES FOR BIG SHOW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mercifully, the preliminaries are nearing an end for Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
After laying waste to the University of the Pacific, 99-72, in front of 10,597 
Saturday night in the Long Beach Arena, there is only one more. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels play Cal State Long Beach in the Big West Conference tournament 
championship game today at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Then it's on to the NCAA tournament, which should provide a more suitable stage 
for the Rebels to strut their stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Against Pacific, a team it had beaten by 40 points this season and had won its 
first tournament game since 1986 on Friday, UNLV played with great indifference 
at times. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels, third-ranked and now 27-5, showed flashes of the brilliance some 
believe will carry them to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
Their smothering man-to-man defense stifled Pacific (15-14). 
</P>
<P>
UNLV struck with startling quickness, passing the ball inside to Larry Johnson 
and David Butler for easy baskets. Pacific seemed defenseless to stop the pair. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had 20 points, making nine of 12 from the field. Butler had 15 and 
Anderson Hunt had 19. 
</P>
<P>
Stacey Augmon, who had 16 points, flew through the lane to slam home a miss by 
Butler early in the game and was no less spectacular finishing off numerous 
fast breaks. 
</P>
<P>
But at other times, UNLV had trouble taking Pacific seriously. The Rebels' lack 
of emotion was one reason the Tigers trailed just 44-33 at halftime.

STASTNY HAUNTS FORMER TEAMMATES AS DEVILS BEAT NORDIQUES

<TEXT>
<P>
The New Jersey Devils were seeking a little more offensive strength when they 
obtained Peter Stastny from the Quebec Nordiques this week. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran center, in just his second game with his new club, turned on his 
former teammates Saturday night at East Rutherford, N.J., and led the Devils to 
a 9-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Stastny, who had spent his entire 10-year career with the Nordiques, had two 
goals and an assist, and the Devils moved into second place in the Patrick 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 4, Philadelphia 3 -- For 17 consecutive seasons, the Flyers have 
made the NHL playoffs. There is a very good chance the streak will end soon. 
</P>
<P>
For the second night in a row, Dino Ciccarelli scored the winning goal in the 
third period and the Capitals extended their unbeaten string to four games 
(3-0-1). 
</P>
<P>
With 10 games left, the Flyers are six points out of fourth place, the final 
playoff spot in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 5, Hartford 0 -- Daren Puppa stopped 31 shots to hand the Whalers their 
first shutout at Hartford, Conn., in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was his first shutout this season, Puppa improved his record to 
28-14-6 and moved the Sabres to within four points of first place in the Adams 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
New York Rangers 2, Minnesota 2 -- Just when it appeared that goaltender Jon 
Casey would lead the North Stars to victory at Bloomington, Minn., a bouncing 
puck led to a tie. 
</P>
<P>
There were less than nine minutes left in regulation when Casey went behind the 
net to play the puck. It skipped away from Casey and out to Brian Mullen, who 
gave the Rangers the tie. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 3, Boston 3 -- The Islanders' winless streak didn't end, but 
they did rally for a tie at Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
With Doug Crossman figuring in all three scores, the Islanders (0-10-2 in the 
last 12 games), earned a point against the team with the best record in the 
NHL. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 3, Montreal 3 -- The Red Wings led, 3-2, but with 35 seconds left in 
regulation and goaltender Patrick Roy removed in favor of another attacker, the 
Canadiens tied it when Mike McPhee put in a shot from above the right slot. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 3, Edmonton 2 -- Vince Damphousse scored twice, and the Maple Leafs 
became the first team to score 300 goals this season. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 2, Chicago 2 -- Brett Hull scored his 66th goal and the Blues held on 
for a tie at St. Louis to retain first place in the Norris Division. DAN HAFNER

John Huston gained some breathing room from the brace of double bogeys that 
ambushed Tom Watson and moved into a one-stroke lead Saturday in the third 
round of the Honda Classic at Coral Springs, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Huston, a third-year touring pro looking for his first victory, coaxed a 
two-under-par 70 from gusty winds and completed three rounds at 211, five under 
par on the TPC at Eagle Trace. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Brooks, also with a 70, came on to take second at 212, one stroke back 
with one round to go. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, still seeking to regain the form that made him golf's dominant figure 
for almost a decade, had to overcome two double bogeys to remain in contention. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have a chance. I'm still within reach," Watson said after he battled 
back from two shots into the water and scored a 73. 
</P>
<P>
He was tied for third at 215, one under par and four strokes away from the 
leader, with Mark Calcavecchia, Ray Floyd, Gil Morgan and Bob Estes. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia, who all but eliminated himself with a 42 on the back nine of the 
second round, came back with a solid 69. Floyd, 47, shot 70. Estes had a 71 and 
the 43-year-old Morgan matched par 72. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Edwards, the second-round leader, shot a 77 that left him six shots back 
at 217. 
</P>
<P>
Patti Rizzo mastered the wind with strong woods and long iron play to shoot a 
two-under-par 70 and extend her lead to three strokes after two rounds of the 
LPGA Desert Inn International at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzo birdied five holes and is at eight-under 136. Second-year pro Maggie Will 
had Saturday's best round, 66, and is at 139.

BIG EIGHT: BUFFALOES BEAT OKLAHOMA STATE FOR THE RIGHT TO FACE OKLAHOMA, A 
WINNER OVER KANSAS, IN TODAY'S FINAL. 
</P>

KANSAS CITY, Mo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somehow it seemed unjust that Oklahoma and Kansas, the No. 1 and No. 2 college 
basketball teams in the whole country, should have to mix it up for the right 
to meet Colorado, the No. 8 team of an eight-team conference. But, that's the 
basketball biz for you. Stuff happens. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma prevailed, 95-77, in Saturday's main event of the Big Eight tournament 
at Kemper Arena, meaning that when the NCAA's 64-team pairings are announced 
today, the top-ranked Sooners almost certainly will be entitled to be seeded 
first at the Midwest Regional, close to home. 
</P>
<P>
A more compelling story, however, is the continued survival of 17-time loser 
Colorado, which can automatically qualify for the NCAA tournament by defeating 
Oklahoma in today's conference title game. Colorado scored its second upset in 
two days for lame-duck Coach Tom Miller, handling Oklahoma State, 82-72, in a 
game scarred by a fistfight between players just as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma (25-4) plays Colorado (12-17) at 1:10 p.m. PST. NCAA bids will be 
extended immediately afterward. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners figure to be home free, no matter what happens today. Win or lose, 
they probably will be assigned a Midwest first-round date at Austin, Tex., then 
proceed, if successful, to subsequent Midwest rounds in Dallas, a couple of 
relatively short hops from Norman, Okla. That's their anticipated reward for 
keeping Kansas at bay in the national rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado, by contrast, must win again or disappear for the season. It also 
holds in its hands the possible fates of Kansas State or Oklahoma State, since, 
considering the competitive level of the Big Eight this season, the conference 
is likely to merit four NCAA bids, and maybe five. A Colorado victory would 
surely knock somebody out. 
</P>
<P>
Not going out without a fight, the Buffaloes got into a near free-for-all at 
game's end Saturday when reserve guard Johnny Terrell from Inglewood took 
exception to what appeared to be a vicious elbow smash by Oklahoma State's 
leading scorer, forward John Potter, just as the clock ran out. Players, 
coaches and officials ganged up to pull the two apart. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened?" Oklahoma State Coach Leonard Hamilton demanded of Terrell 
later. Terrell told him by raising his elbow neck-high, demonstrating how 
Potter hit him. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, trying not to take sides, decided to put it this way: "It's my 
understanding that Potter, uh, set a very physical pick. And obviously it 
irritated the young man." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, since the young man tried to separate Potter from his teeth. Terrell 
later brushed it off as no big deal, just part of the game, but teammate Stevie 
Wise said: "Johnny Potter threw a 'bow at Johnny Terrell's throat, so our 
Johnny retaliated." 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, back to basketball: Unlike Friday's game, when Colorado led Missouri 
from start to finish, a comeback was required. The Buffaloes were behind by as 
many as seven points in the first half before rallying behind center Shaun 
Vandiver's 26 points and 16 rebounds, possibly sending Oklahoma State (16-13) 
to the NIT. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma's comeback was even more impressive. After spotting Kansas a 15-5 
lead, the Sooners kept the Jayhawks 40 points below their tournament-record, 
117-point onslaught of the night before. Oklahoma also made 20 of 30 shots in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"It was sorta like a horror show," Kansas Coach Roy Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
All five Sooner starters scored in double figures, led by guard Skeeter Henry 
with 24 points and forward Jackie Jones with 23. The game was close, 60-57, 
with 15:30 minutes remaining, but Coach Billy Tubbs was able to substitute 
freely after a 21-6 run gave Oklahoma plenty of breathing room. 
</P>
<P>
Said Oklahoma guard Smokey McCovery, who passed expertly all day: "We just kept 
pushing the ball and didn't allow them to set up. We could see them getting 
tired, even in the first half. We're one of the deepest teams in the nation and 
we didn't give them a chance to breathe." 
</P>
<P>
In separate but equal ways, principals from both Oklahoma and Colorado were 
able to poke fun at those who, in their minds, underestimated them. 
</P>
<P>
Tubbs told a news conference: "I want to congratulate somebody. I read 
somewhere that 25 of y'all were asked to pick the winner and 24 of y'all picked 
Kansas. 'Fess up, is that true? At least one of you's smarter'n hell. Who wants 
to take credit?" 
</P>
<P>
Whatever poll Tubbs was referring to was a mystery to those present. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado guard Reggie Morton probably had better grounds to reply, when asked 
if he was surprised by the team's play: "Let me ask a question of the media: 
Did you think we could do it?" 
</P>
<P>
No one 'fessed up or took credit. 
</P>
<P>
The deciding factor in today's game could come down to who is wearing what. 
Oklahoma is 19-0 this season in its white uniforms. It will wear them again. 
Colorado has been unstoppable since its coach has been wearing a lucky pink 
shirt. Miller intends to wear it again, and said: "If nobody's standing next to 
me in the huddle, you'll know I didn't get to wash it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Morton: "The way we're playing, we could come out naked and win." 
</P>
<P>
Tied 53-53, Colorado scored seven consecutive points on a fast-break by Wise, a 
three-pointer from the left side by Brent Vaughan and a follow-up lay-in by 
Vandiver, who repeatedly took advantage of opposing center Byron Houston's four 
fouls. Vandiver and Houston this season were the Big Eight's leading 
rebounders. 
</P>
<P>
The closest Oklahoma State came thereafter was 74-70 in the final minute. 
Colorado promptly hit eight consecutive free throws for an insurmountable lead, 
and that was all the action until the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Vandiver, who has been outspoken on the ouster of his coach, who was fired 
before the end of the season, said with typically colorful language: "We put 
our egos and our self-pities and our views to the side and just played ball. We 
didn't want to go home. We wanted to stay at the dance." 
</P>
<P>
Can Colorado beat Oklahoma? 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma's coach doesn't know, but he is taking nothing for granted. "I think 
Colorado forgot they were the eighth-place team," Tubbs said. "Colorado isn't 
playing like an eighth-place team. I guarantee y'all, we won't look down our 
noses at Colorado."

LOCKOUT: PLENTY OF BLAME SHARED

<P>
The health and stability of baseball can be measured in dollars -- but not a 
lot of sense. 
</P>
<P>
On one side are the owners, with 1990 revenues anticipated to be $1.2 to $1.5 
billion for a full season. On the other are the players, with a 1990 average 
salary of more than $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
But they have managed to blow most of spring training and, apparently, the 
start of the season in a face-saving, pride-saving squabble over what the Major 
League Players Assn. estimates to be another $8 million to $12 million a year 
if players with more than two years but less than three of major league service 
were eligible for salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
The players view it as something of a moral issue. The owners talk about 
economic control. It is Day 25 of the spring training lockout with no end in 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
A negotiating process that began in mid-December is approaching its fourth 
month. Revenue sharing might be off the table, but there seems to be plenty of 
blame left to be shared. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest share probably would be voted the owners, who are asking the 
players to help create a system that will help the owners control themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Having failed to sell revenue sharing, the owners seemed determined to wage war 
over arbitration. And equally determined, perhaps, to test the solidarity of 
the union -- perhaps even to break it by sacrificing a month or two of the 
season, costing the players pay. 
</P>
<P>
Blame sharing? 
</P>
<P>
Here's a possible distribution: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE OWNERS 
</P>
<P>
At a time of unprecedented prosperity and popularity for the national pastime, 
they were doling out multimillion-dollar contracts faster than you can say 
"ego." They then tried to restructure the economic system with a 
revenue-sharing plan designed to eliminate arbitration and modify free agency. 
</P>
<P>
It was accompanied by a pay-for-performance salary system that failed to 
account for character and defense. It produced the seemingly long-planned 
lockout aimed at preventing the pressure and economic evils of another 
mid-season strike by the players. 
</P>
<P>
Cynics might say that the owners may know greed, but little about timing. 
</P>
<P>
They sought immediate implementation of revenue sharing while floating in black 
ink, unable to answer such union questions as, "Why do we need this?" and 
"Where are the problems?" 
</P>
<P>
But pursue it the owners did, seeming to waste two months on a proposal that 
almost all evidence indicated wouldn't fly, and ultimately invoking the lockout 
they defended as a positive option in collective negotiations, an instrument of 
leverage. 
</P>
<P>
Why, it might be asked, a lockout when the players have nothing at stake 
financially? What has it done except alienate fans and businesses in Arizona 
and Florida? 
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence to suggest it intimidated the leadership or membership of 
the union, but it did give union zealots a cause. And it has made the difficult 
process of negotiation more difficult, eventually telescoping the talks into 
this week's crisis attempt to save the opening of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Why, it might also be asked, create and operate in that type of atmosphere at a 
time of unbridled health? At a time when the owners and commissioner have been 
publicizing the need to build a better relationship with a union that lost 
trust in management during the winters of collusion and the negotiations of 
1985, when the clubs, by all accounts, made misleading claims of financial 
distress. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue participation and pay for performance were shelved, but the beat went 
on, the owners offering a variety of concepts designed to modify or restrict 
arbitration and salaries, but which did nothing more than continue to sour the 
union and delay talks. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to this strategic inconsistency, there seemed to be no one person 
in charge of selling the owners' program. The players who sat in on 
negotiations emerged shaking their heads, muttering about a lack of management 
leadership and authority. 
</P>
<P>
One day it would be Commissioner Fay Vincent, the next his deputy, Steve 
Greenberg. One day it would be Bud Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers and 
chairman of the owners' Player Relations Committee, the next PRC general 
counsel Charles O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
One day, Harry Dalton, general manager of the Brewers, and Frank Cashen, 
president of the New York Mets, devised a regressive proposal that so outraged 
the union that Greenberg was prompted to apologize by saying, "Yesterday didn't 
happen." Cashen and Dalton didn't return to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
At literally the 11th hour Wednesday night, with opening day on the line and 
the union having proposed what seemed to be a legitimate compromise on 
arbitration eligibility, apparently the hawks stuck their talons in the 
players' hide. 
</P>
<P>
The PRC is made up of five club owners and president Fred Kuhlmann of the St. 
Louis Cardinals. Four of the owners -- Carl Pohlad of the Minnesota Twins, 
Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox, John McMullen of the Houston Astros 
and Selig -- are considered the most aggressive supporters of revenue sharing 
-- Selig having helped author it -- and economic change. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever the PRC assembles, the voices of reason, moderation and compromise -- 
Vincent, Greenberg, O'Connor, Kuhlmann and PRC member Fred Wilpon, co-owner of 
the Mets -- seem to fade. It is difficult to believe but must be assumed that 
the hawks speak for the majority of owners. No rollback of arbitration 
eligibility. No compromise that includes restoration of arbitration for players 
with fewer than three years' service, no matter how limited. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, of course, there will be a settlement, but at what price to the 
fans and damage to the union? There seems to be an obvious element among 
ownership that doesn't care about that damage to the union. Test it. Break it. 
Some believe that has been the hidden agenda all along. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
The players didn't create revenue sharing. They didn't devise the lockout. They 
only asked for protection against collusion and improvements in the status quo, 
along with the return of that year of arbitration eligibility they gave up in 
1985 as a concession to the owners' claims of financial distress. 
</P>
<P>
But this is a union conditioned to winning, to getting its way, and during 
these negotiations its representatives seemed to create the same sense of 
winning and losing, of saving face, that they accused the owners of doing. 
</P>
<P>
They turned the arbitration issue into a morality play that generally has no 
place in the hard-core world of labor negotiations. And, when given the chance 
to accept or propose a compromise by Vincent 10 days ago, they passed -- 
believing, perhaps, that they would eventually have it all their way again. 
</P>
<P>
Was 1985 a "profound larceny" on the part of the owners, as the union's 
associate general counsel, Gene Orza, has said? 
</P>
<P>
Executive Director Don Fehr asked if any self-respecting union should be 
expected to accept a situation that has seen industry revenue increase $500 
million since 1985, while the average salary of players with more than two but 
fewer than three years of major league service has decreased 41% because the 
players, responding to the owners' financial distortions in 1985, gave up a 
year of arbitration? 
</P>
<P>
The rhetoric is compelling, but the fact is that players with only two-plus 
seasons are still averaging $219,000. And there is also this: 1985 is gone, as 
is 1976, when the owners -- over the warnings of Gene Autry and Charles Finley 
-- accepted the system of arbitration as part of the bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
In protesting the regressive aspects of revenue sharing and pay for 
performance, the union said it would not turn back the clock and give up rights 
earned in fair bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement of 1985 might not represent fair bargaining to the union, but can 
it legitimately expect the owners to turn back the clock, to give back that 
year of arbitration, which they claim was not yielded by the union as a 
concession but in exchange for major increases in minimum salary and pension 
contribution? 
</P>
<P>
Having warded off all of the salary caps and modifications, does the union have 
to win on the arbitration issue, too? Aren't the improvements the union is sure 
to receive in other areas enough? 
</P>
<P>
Trust is important. By rolling back that year of eligibility the owners would 
do much to restore it. But perception is important, too. For once, a public 
that sees only dollar signs seems to understand that the players had no part in 
creating this mess. 
</P>
<P>
The long battle to get the year of eligibility back might have cost the union 
that favorable perception. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE COMMISSIONER 
</P>
<P>
Still measuring his scope of power and constitutional footing, Vincent has been 
active at the bargaining table, trying, in his own words, to be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
He has seemed to be that and more, offering suggestions, working privately on 
compromises, keeping the parties talking, maintaining the conciliatory tenor, 
extensively employing Greenberg, an attorney and former player agent who has 
had a long relationship with Fehr. 
</P>
<P>
And refreshingly, unlike previous commissioners, Vincent has not been coy about 
his position. He is a mediator who represents the owners. And in that regard, 
unlike predecessor Peter Ueberroth, he has seemed unwilling to challenge the 
inherent impotency of the office. 
</P>
<P>
Although he encouraged the owners to move on from revenue sharing, he has 
adhered to the lockout strategy that was created while he was deputy 
commissioner under the late Bart Giamatti. He talks sympathetically about the 
fans, expresses anguish in regard to business losses in Arizona and Florida, 
but the lockout lingers. 
</P>
<P>
His attempt to lift it in exchange for a union pledge not to strike seemed 
sadly ill-conceived. If sincere, it emerged as strictly a public relations ploy 
when there was no attempt to formally propose it to the union and work out the 
problems before staging a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
It was also viewed, even by some on management's side, as a show of weakness. 
The bold move, they contend, would be to lift the lockout without a pledge, 
leaving the union to decide if it wants to carry the burden of a work stoppage, 
a risk Vincent has said he won't take. 
</P>
<P>
It also seems apparent that he has been unable to gain complete control of the 
PRC hawks, nor to revise the negotiating strategy so that the union would be 
certain whom it was working with. 
</P>
<P>
On Day 25 of a lockout that many on both sides believe should not have been 
enforced -- and never have lasted this long -- a settlement is probably within 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
Management is willing to give the players in the two-three year category the 
dollars, but in a pool arrangement unacceptable to the union, which wants 
arbitration -- certain to create a ripple affect the owners fear, and a 
bargaining right they are apparently unwilling to yield. 
</P>
<P>
Said Vincent recently: "The union and I agree that there will be baseball in my 
administration. We just don't know which year." 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, there may be more truth than humor in that.

BIG EAST: SECOND-STRINGERS SPARK HUSKIES, WHO OUST GEORGETOWN AND WILL FACE 
SYRACUSE IN TOURNAMENT FINAL.

<P>
When they met at game's end, Georgetown's John Thompson offered Jim Calhoun a 
handshake and a compliment that will forever ring sweetly in the Connecticut 
coach's memory. 
</P>
<P>
"Magnificent," Thompson said simply. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson knew. So did Calhoun and anyone else who ventured into Madison Square 
Garden and saw Connecticut defeat favored Georgetown, 65-60, in the first of 
two Big East tournament semifinal games Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
While the second contest, a 73-61 Syracuse victory over Villanova, featured 
artistry -- Derrick Coleman had 25 points, 23 rebounds and two blocked shots 
for the Orangemen -- it lacked drama and a certain emotion. In contrast, the 
Huskies' win lacked very little, certainly not heroes, of which there were 
many. 
</P>
<P>
Begin with sophomore center Dan Cyrulik, a 7-foot-1 lug who usually spends 
two-thirds of most Connecticut games on the bench. Against Georgetown and its 
twin office buildings, Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo, Cyrulik was good 
for six points, seven rebounds and 21 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Good thing, too, since the Huskies needed every one of the precious baskets and 
minutes after starting center Rod Sellers' knee was injured less than two 
minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Cyrulik's day didn't start well. He was called quickly for a foul and 30 
seconds later, was called for traveling. Mourning did his part, chiding him at 
every opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to try to talk to you," Cyrulik said. "But you've got to give it 
back to him. If he senses weakness . . . " 
</P>
<P>
All Mourning could have sensed Saturday was resolve. Cyrulik didn't fold, 
though he did tire. That's when Calhoun sent freshman Toraino Walker into the 
game. Walker, who usually averages about six minutes a game, responded with 
seven rebounds, 17 minutes and four points, almost all of which came in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
"He dominates our practices," guard Tate George said of Walker. "When we 
scrimmage, the blue team (Connecticut's second-stringers) pretty much wipes us 
out two out of every five times." 
</P>
<P>
Together, Cyrulik and Walker sent Alonzo into mourning and Mutombo to oblivion. 
Mourning could manage only 12 points and Mutombo just four. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut's plan was simple enough: double-team Georgetown's big men, 
especially Mourning, and force the Hoyas to make their points from the outside. 
In fact, there on the Huskies' locker room blackboard was the message: 
</P>
<P>
 Mourning -- frustrated by double downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutombo -- body him outside. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, at the very bottom of the blackboard was scribbled: 
</P>
<P>
Believe in us. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, well, this was a fine scheme when Sellers was available, but an improbable 
one when he limped off the court and spent the remainder of game with his knee 
packed in ice. 
</P>
<P>
"No question we thought the game would change with Rod out of there," Calhoun 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But for the better? 
</P>
<P>
It was less than two weeks ago that Georgetown beat Connecticut by 20 points at 
the Capital Centre. Saturday, under favorable circumstances, the Hoyas scored 
only 24 points the entire second half. Not surprisingly, it would be their 
undoing. 
</P>
<P>
For 8 minutes 11 seconds, Georgetown couldn't score a basket. An eight-point 
lead became a six-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Tillmon ended the dry spell with a desperation three-point shot that 
clanked off the backboard and into the hoop. Georgetown trailed, 53-50, with 
4:38 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoyas wouldn't score another field goal until 24 seconds were left in the 
game. Instead, they had to settle for three free throws and, ultimately, a 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's crying in our locker room," Thompson said. "That's a difficult team 
for us to play against. We were beaten by a very good team." 
</P>
<P>
Villanova's Rollie Massimino found himself issuing similar praise to Syracuse 
and the multi-talented Coleman, who had more than half of the Orangemen's 
rebounds and more than one-third of their points. He dominated the game in 
almost every respect. 
</P>
<P>
"Coleman was just so terrific for them," he gushed. 
</P>
<P>
Even Villanova center Tom Greis, a senior who has logged considerable time 
against Syracuse, said it was "the best I've seen him play." 
</P>
<P>
And this from the guy who scored 23 points and grabbed 12 rebounds Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Derrick played a great game," he said. "Nothing else needs to be said." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman set a Big East tournament single-game rebounding record and tied a 
conference single-game record with Danny Schayes, another Syracuse man who now 
plays for the Denver Nuggets. Coleman's reaction? 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing," he said. "Another milestone." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said he "struggled" in the first half, which is sort of true. He was 
three of 10 from the field, but already he had 10 rebounds. "Rebounds are just 
heart and desire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, Villanova tried to slow the game down to a manageable pace. It 
worked before, as the Wildcats were the only Big East team to sweep Syracuse 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
And it worked again, at least, for the first half. The Orangemen scored only 27 
points and led by just five. It was exactly what Massimino had hoped for and 
exactly what Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim feared. 
</P>
<P>
Villanova made its run shortly thereafter and with 15:06 left in the game, the 
Wildcats were ahead by one, 32-31. 
</P>
<P>
Then Syracuse broke free, doing what it does best, which is run and score off 
the fast break. The Orangemen grabbed the lead about a minute later and never 
glanced back. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it felt kind of different," guard Stephen Thompson said. "We haven't 
been able to do that for so long." 
</P>
<P>
Now on to today's Big East final, where Connecticut awaits. Coleman casually 
predicted an afternoon to remember. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you should just look for a great ballgame," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After Saturday's performance, nobody was doubting the claim.

JIM MURRAY: HE'S THE PERFECT TRAINER FOR THE PERFECT RACE HORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even the horses love Laz Barrera. They must. They run right out of their 
breeding for him. There is a saying around the race track: If you've got a 
cheap horse, there's a dozen guys you can give him to. If you've got a good 
horse, there's only one -- give him to Laz Barrera. 
</P>
<P>
A good trainer cannot make a bad horse win. But a bad trainer can make a good 
horse lose. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, the Puerto Rican owners of Bold Forbes thought they had a pretty good 
horse. Bold Forbes had beaten the best Puerto Rico had to offer, but beating 
the best at El Commandante was a far cry from beating the best at Aqueduct, 
Santa Anita, Churchill Downs and Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Laz got through with him, Bold Forbes had won at Santa Anita, 
Aqueduct (the Wood Memorial), Churchill Downs (the Kentucky Derby) and Belmont 
(the Belmont) and came within a clipped and bleeding coronet suffered in the 
Preakness of winning the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
It was an impressive bit of conditioning. Bold Forbes was out of a Bold Ruler 
line and not supposed to be able to get any distance longer than 1 1/16 miles. 
"He'll need a cab at the eighth pole," sneered the handicappers. But Bold 
Forbes not only got the Derby's 1 1/4 miles, he won the Belmont's 1 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
But that was 14 years ago. Earlier this year, Laz Barrera got another call from 
Puerto Rico. Martha Fernandez, whose husband is in the construction business on 
the island, explained to Laz that she bought this colt at the Ocala sales for 
$15,000, but while his breeding seemed undistinguished, he won 13 consecutive 
races. He might deserve the big leagues, and she hated to think she was keeping 
him in the bush leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Laz sometimes feels like a football coach who gets called by an 
enthusiastic alumnus about a can't-miss prospect. And when he asks, "And who is 
this phenom?" the answer comes back, "My nephew." 
</P>
<P>
So, Laz tried to be diplomatic. It's his stock-in-trade. "What's the horse's 
name?" he wanted to know. "Mister Frisky," came the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Now, that didn't have a nice macho ring to it like Man o'War or Aristides or 
Gallant Fox. It sounded a little Disneylandish, a little frivolous. Maybe the 
horse was, too. Laz temporized. "Send me some tapes," he sighed. 
</P>
<P>
You can't always tell a bad horse from moving pictures. But you can spot a good 
one right away. Laz watched the tapes and felt his scalp begin to prickle. This 
was the greatest movie horse since Trigger. The owner phoned. "Do you think 
this horse can win in the States?" she wanted to know. "Ma'am!" Barrera 
exploded. "This horse can win anywhere!" 
</P>
<P>
Recalls Laz: "This horse had a style of running only the great ones have, where 
his feet stay low to the ground and he just eats up the track. I spent four 
days watching the tape and I couldn't find a fault with him. He never made a 
wrong move." 
</P>
<P>
Still, San Juan is not Santa Anita. Laz brought his colt up out of quarantine 
and dropped him into the seven-furlong San Vicente Stakes, traditional 
steppingstone for the Santa Anita (and Kentucky) Derby and a tough test for an 
immigrant. Mister Frisky turned back promising 3-year-olds such as Tarascon and 
Top Cash with ease. Three weeks later, Laz tacked him for the tougher one-mile 
San Rafael Stakes. He won more easily -- 15 for 15, one off Citation's all-time 
string of 16 for 16. 
</P>
<P>
Is he another Citation? Is he another Bold Forbes? Is he another Man o'War? Is 
he a freak? A monster (race-trackers' word for horses that outrun their 
breeding and run past horses theoretically their superiors)? Or is he just a 
nice sprinter making the most of a bad year for 3-year-olds? 
</P>
<P>
First of all, Mister Frisky looks like a champion. Statues in the paddock look 
like this. He has this great, gorgeous coating of solid copper; there is not a 
white stocking or nose blaze to break up the burnished metal tone of his skin. 
They called Man o'War Big Red because he glinted like this in the sunlight, and 
Mister Frisky looks like the color of a brand-new shiny penny. 
</P>
<P>
Laz Barrera's Cuban accent has been described as a cross between Desi Arnaz 
with hiccups and Ricardo Montalban with a mouthful of mashed potatoes -- "You 
can never tell whether Laz is speaking English with a Spanish accent or Spanish 
with an English accent," cracks fellow trainer Charlie Whittingham. It is 
sometimes indecipherable in any language. But he gets positively eloquent on 
the subject of Mister Frisky. William Jennings Bryan couldn't say it any 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Laz notes, among other things, that Mister Frisky is a placid individual. He 
has that attitude of the player who knows he's good. He has that ability all 
great athletes have of being able to relax between spurts of competition. If he 
were a fighter, he would be able to go to sleep on the rubbing table an hour 
before a title fight. He never arrives in a paddock awash with anxiety and 
soapy sweat. "He has not been touched with the whip -- at least not in this 
country," Laz boasts. He does it his way. 
</P>
<P>
If Mister Frisky gets him to the winner's circle in Kentucky the first Saturday 
in May, Laz Barrera will have the best winning percentage of any trainer in the 
history of the Derby. He already is, except for the Jones Boys of Calumet Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Laz has won two Kentucky Derbies out of four tries. Plain Ben Jones won six 
Derbies out of 11 tries. His son, Jimmy, won two out of four. Col. E.R. 
Bradley's trainer, Herbert J. Thompson, won four Derbies -- but he sent out 24 
horses. 
</P>
<P>
Laz, who has been training horses since he was brought up on the old Oriental 
Park race track in Havana that his grandparents owned and operated -- and which 
Castro turned into an army barracks -- is not so concerned for Mister Frisky to 
be another Bold Forbes as he is for him to be another Affirmed. 
</P>
<P>
You see, not only did Affirmed win the Triple Crown, but Laz considers him to 
be the greatest race horse of all time. His logic is unassailable. "He is the 
best horse I ever see and maybe anybody ever see and I will tell you why: None 
of those other horses -- Citation, Secretariat, Man o'War -- had to beat what 
Affirmed had to beat: Alydar. Alydar was a great race horse. If Affirmed wasn't 
there, Alydar wins the Triple Crown. And he is recognized as one of the five 
best horses of all time. And Affirmed beat him every time. Wouldn't let him by. 
I don't know who Citation and Seattle Slew and those horses had to beat, but it 
wasn't Alydar."

The Kentucky Derby is the hardest race in the world to win. But Laz Barrera has 
already won two. And Mister Frisky probably thinks it's a piece of cake. Now, 
winning in Puerto Rico, that's hard.

HERE'S SOME EXPERT ADVICE FOR EVERY PROSPECTIVE BOXING CHAMPION: TRY ANOTHER

<P>
Agonizingly arm-weary from what had seemed an eternity of adrenaline-laced 
combat inside the boxing ring -- less than three minutes to be precise -- a 
reporter relaxed for a moment and dropped his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The fist, neatly packaged inside a hard, black leather glove, landed almost 
instantly then, a quick right flush on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Electricity coursed through his head and down into his legs. He felt as though 
he had just been hit by the heavyweight champion of the world, which was, of 
course, ridiculous. He had only been belted in the face by the middleweight 
champion of the world. 
</P>
<P>
No sport is tougher than boxing. No sport is more brutal. No sport requires a 
participant to accept and ultimately grow accustomed to such stunning pain. 
Boxers die. They suffer major injuries, such as detached retinas and other eye 
injuries, and debilitating injuries to the brain, with alarming regularity. 
</P>
<P>
And yet they come in swarms, the would-be boxers. They puff up their chests and 
suck in their stomachs and stride menacingly into hundreds of boxing gyms 
around the nation and announce to anyone who will listen that they intend to 
become professional fighters. They have watched boxing on television, maybe 
even seen it in person a few times, and have concluded that it is not very 
tough. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, they are turned away, told in strong terms to rid such ideas from 
their heads. Occasionally, though, they persist. And then, as the real boxers 
smirk in the dim light of the sweaty gym, the novices are fitted into gloves 
and ushered into the ring, there to show their talents against real boxers. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, they are pounded and humiliated for a few minutes before realizing 
they have made a terrible mistake and head quickly for the door. 
</P>
<P>
Often, they are knocked senseless. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Gaye strode purposefully into the 108th Street Gym in Los Angeles many 
years ago. The late singer boasted to all that he had boxed, and it wasn't so 
difficult. He wanted to box again. 
</P>
<P>
So Walt Tyler, a boxing trainer, obliged, quickly arranging a sparring match 
between Gaye and S. T. Gordon, a talented, professional, 190-pound 
cruiserweight. Gaye, his entourage of bodyguards and friends watching, pounded 
his gloves together in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
The bell rang. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, who didn't much care if the man staring at him from across the ring was 
Marvin Gaye or then-middleweight champion Marvin Hagler, took three long steps 
across the mat and threw one punch. It landed flush on Gaye's chin, and the 
singer fell like a chain-sawed tree. 
</P>
<P>
He was unconscious for about 30 seconds, according to Tyler. Gaye finally got 
to his feet, Tyler recalled and, as he was being half-dragged out by his 
friends, he was engaged in a question-and-answer session with them. The topics 
included the singer's name and what city he was in. 
</P>
<P>
"The man was out cold," Tyler said. "And S. T. Gordon is still in the ring, 
pacing around like a bull waiting for the next guy." 
</P>
<P>
Boxing appears easy. Anyone can make a fist. And most people can throw some 
sort of a punch. It doesn't look as difficult as, say, hitting a golf ball, 
which requires fairly elaborate movement. Boxing seems to require only a 
clenched hand being propelled forward by the arm. What could be easier? 
</P>
<P>
 The middleweight champion of the world, Michael Nunn, was circling the 
reporter now in a Van Nuys gym, flicking out right jabs from his southpaw 
stance. In one dizzying 15-second stretch, he threw seven lightning-quick 
punches. Six landed flush on the reporter's face. 
</P>
<P>
 The reporter blocked the other with his glove, although the force of the blow 
slammed that glove back into the bewildered man's face. He had just, in 
essence, punched himself in the nose. Pain and frustration, present since the 
opening seconds of the bout, now had to move over to make room for humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Guys sit around watching boxing on TV and they say to each other, 'I could do 
that,' " said Joe Goossen, Nunn's trainer. "Pro boxers make it look easy. But 
nothing is further from the truth. Nothing in sports is even close to being as 
difficult and as exhausting as boxing." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Goossen, Nunn's manager and the president of the Ten Goose Boxing Club in 
Van Nuys, said he receives as many as 25 calls a month from men who want to 
chuck their regular jobs and become boxers. The number of calls increases 
dramatically, he said, immediately after a major fight, such as the Mike 
Tyson-Buster Douglas bout in February. 
</P>
<P>
"Always, it's, 'I wanna be the champ,' " Goossen said. "The most calls come 
after a big fight. The day after the Tyson-Douglas fight, I got four calls from 
guys who insisted they could be the heavyweight champion of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"None of them had ever boxed. In those cases, I refer them to the state boxing 
commission. I tell them the state commission will be able to help them. 
Basically, I don't want to be impolite to anybody, but I don't want these guys 
calling me." 
</P>
<P>
For two months, Goossen had been getting phone calls from a man identifying 
himself only as Sampson. He said he was a former member of the Bloods street 
gang and he wanted a chance to show off his boxing skills. Goossen politely put 
him off, only to get another call from Sampson a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
Laker owner Jerry Buss, who presents numerous boxing shows at the Forum, 
offered that he knew Sampson, and that the man might be worth watching. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, late in February, Goossen gave in. Sampson was told to show up at the 
gym, which he did in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
"He came rolling in here with his fiancee on his arm, both of them wearing fur 
coats," Joe Goossen recalled. "After he got the coat off, we took a look at 
him, and it was impressive. He was 6-foot-2 and weighed 250 pounds and it was 
rock-hard muscle." 
</P>
<P>
Off in one corner of the gym, John Bray banged away at a punching bag. Bray 
weighs about 190 pounds. He is just 19 years old. But at the time he also was 
the national amateur heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
After a few moments of boasting about his strength, Sampson's massive hands 
were stuffed into a pair of boxing gloves and the ring shook as the mass of 
muscle climbed through the ropes, awaiting his chance to knock someone out into 
the street with one punch. 
</P>
<P>
Bray stepped through the ropes on the other side of the ring. The bell rang, 
and Sampson lunged wildly across the ring at Bray, throwing powerful punches 
that likely would have knocked out a rhino, had they hit the rhino. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty seconds after the action began, it was over. Sampson, who had not landed 
a single punch in the flurry that he threw at Bray, stumbled crazily across the 
ring, his legs having been turned into cooked spaghetti by the crisp, accurate 
punches of the man 60 pounds lighter. "It was obvious this guy had seen some 
fights on TV and said to himself, 'I can beat those guys,' " Bray said. "He had 
these huge, bulging arms and I'm sure he was as strong as any heavyweight in 
history. But boxing is strength of spirit, strength of heart. It is not 
strength of arms. 
</P>
<P>
"Before we fought, this guy is standing in front of the mirrors flexing his 
arms and looking at himself. Then he started looking at me, looking like he was 
going to kill me. Staring at me. It was pretty funny." 
</P>
<P>
Bray easily sidestepped Sampson's initial charge. Then, for the next 10 
seconds, he simply tied the giant man in knots. As Sampson struggled to get 
free of Bray's arms, his energy level dropped quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"After about 20 seconds, I started hitting him," Bray said. "And I mean just 
tapping him on the chin. Tap, tap, tap. Then one right hand, and believe me, it 
was an easy right hand, that landed on his chin. And this guy went down in a 
heap and that was that. 
</P>
<P>
"The man didn't realize that he was in my office. This is where I work. This is 
what I do, and I've been doing it very seriously for 10 years, since I was 9." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nunn leaned his taut, 160-pound body against the ropes and, with a wave of his 
flashing left hand, invited the reporter into the corner for some close-in 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
 The reporter obliged, moving in and throwing a sorry left, followed by a 
pitiful right. A few more punches bounced off Nunn's shoulders, and then a left 
found Nunn's midsection and a right barely glanced off the champion's chin. 
Nunn responded with five frighteningly fast punches, the last of which thudded 
solidly into the reporter's exposed right side. 
</P>
<P>
 Pain streaked upward and his right arm fell limply to his side. It was quickly 
followed by the rest of the reporter's body, which toppled hard to the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel and Rafael Ruelas, 18 and 19 and with the faces of children, have boxed 
since they were children. They walked into the Ten Goose gym as elementary 
school students from Arleta and told the Goossens they wanted to be boxers. 
They were told to take a hike. 
</P>
<P>
But Alonzo Strongbow, a veteran pro boxer who was working out in the gym that 
day, watched the two kids pleading their case with Dan Goossen and persuaded 
Goossen to let the kids work out. 
</P>
<P>
"Alonzo told us he saw something in their eyes," Goossen said. "He said they 
had the look." 
</P>
<P>
The Ruelas brothers, fortunately, were allowed to stay. They have fought nearly 
35 professional bouts. And they have yet to be beaten. Their boxing skills have 
put them on a track to become perhaps the rarest thing in the sport: 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is easy about it," said Gabriel, the older brother. "The training is 
so hard you can't imagine it. And the fighting is much harder than that. We 
spar in the ring every day and you get punched in the face every day. Every 
single day. Bang! Right on the nose. And it hurts every time." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rafael: "You get that first bang in the face and you feel pain and your 
eyes water. You try not to think about the pain, about the sting, but you can't 
help it. You have to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
The difference between the Ruelas brothers and most prospective boxers, 
according to them and Joe Goossen, is that they are willing to accept a blow to 
the face as part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started sparring with Gabriel, he would hit me real hard," Rafael 
said. "He would hurt me with punches, but even then, I liked it. I liked 
knowing that I could take it. And as the weeks went by and you started learning 
how to avoid some of the punches, and then learned how to punch back, it became 
real exciting. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, when I can beat up on a guy in the ring who has a lot of experience, 
and he sees me as just a little kid, that's a great feeling." 
</P>
<P>
As a young professional, a boxer can expect to be paid roughly $100 for each 
scheduled round. A scheduled four-round bout will bring him about $400 and, 
perhaps, a swollen and bleeding face. That is the level at which most boxers 
stay. They take enormous punishment for a few thousand dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
Several dozen of the tens of thousands of people who try boxing make very good 
money, with paydays in the $50,000-$100,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few -- Tyson, Nunn, Sugar Ray Leonard, Thomas Hearns and Roberto Duran 
in recent years -- ever make that final step to mega-money, to the land of 
million-dollar fights. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, the International Boxing Federation champion, began boxing when he was 
11. From the start, he was good. He won the Golden Gloves tournament in his 
home state of Iowa and barely missed a berth on the 1984 U.S. Olympic team. But 
even with his enormous talent, it has taken him 17 years of excruciatingly hard 
work to achieve his success and the big paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was an amateur, I used to fight giant guys in the ring during 
sparring," Nunn said. "Giant guys. Three hundred-pound guys. They'd come in the 
gym and think they were really tough and my trainer would call me over and we'd 
get in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
"I must have knocked out a half a dozen guys back then who weighed 100, 150 
pounds more than me. It taught me that size and strength mean nothing in 
boxing. It's all technique." 
</P>
<P>
And even though he has reached the top of his sport, Nunn said he would never 
encourage anyone to try it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's simply too tough," he said. "So few people ever make any money from it. I 
never try to encourage anyone to start boxing. To be honest, I wouldn't wish 
boxing upon my worst enemy." 
</P>
<P>
Pete Olker of Sylmar was a boxer. He trained at the Frankie Goodman Gym in Van 
Nuys and the Main Street Gym in Los Angeles during the early '60s and fought 
four times. He took two terrible beatings. And then, wisely, he quit. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was so ready," said Olker, 58. "I had no amateur experience, but I 
felt good in the gym and because I was a heavyweight, it was hard to find 
sparring partners. So I never really knew if I was any good. 
</P>
<P>
"I found out in my first pro fight. I fought some guy who had something like a 
12-10 record, and I figured he must be a bum. He knocked me out in two 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Olker tried again a month later. He was knocked out in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can tell you how hard boxing is," Olker said. "It cannot be explained. 
But the exhaustion you feel when someone is trying to smash you in the face and 
you're trying to escape and find a way to hit him back . . . you just can't 
imagine what that feels like." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The reporter stupidly got up. His hands felt as though they had bowling balls 
on them. His legs felt as heavy as Christmas fruit cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn moved in and began whistling lefts and rights from 10 different angles. 
Fortunately, none of them landed on the now wheezing and sagging reporter. 
Luckily, Nunn had decided that enough was enough and was now intentionally 
missing his opponent. Perhaps his knuckles ached from the beating they had been 
given by the reporter's forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 The "fight" was over. TKO at 2:50 of the first round. 
</P>
<P>
The door of the Ten Goose gym swings open and the light in the doorway is 
briefly blocked out as 6-foot-7, 280-pound Andre Phillips strolls through. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips played football briefly at USC and then played for two years at 
Central State in Ohio. For the last few months he has been employed at a Valley 
nightclub as a bouncer. He is 23. He wants to be a boxer. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched the Tyson-Douglas fight," he says. "I think that influenced me. It 
showed me that anyone can get beat, even a guy like Tyson. I see a guy like 
Buster Douglas and I don't see anything special. I watched that fight and I 
thought, 'Maybe I can beat somebody, too.' " 
</P>
<P>
A few feet away, in a corner of the gym, the steady pounding of the heavy bag 
stops for a moment and John Bray, who has seen this movie before, peeks out 
from behind the bag, stealing a glance at the newcomer. A second later, Bray 
returns to his workout. He glances again at the giant man who wants to be a 
boxer. 
</P>
<P>
A huge grin lights up Bray's face, but his hands continue to pound out a 
thudding, steady and sometimes deadly rhythm against the heavy leather bag.

MIKE DOWNEY: COLORADO COACH RIDES WAVE TO INEVITABLE UNEMPLOYMENT 
</P>

This isn't quite as goofy as the Bo Schembechler Fires Bill Frieder, Hires 
Steve Fisher, Wins National Championship, Is Forced to Keep Steve Fisher 
college basketball headline story of 1989 -- but it's getting there, it's 
getting there. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Miller is the coach at the University of Colorado -- temporarily. His team 
will play here today. If it wins, it will qualify -- with 17 defeats -- for the 
NCAA tournament's 64-school field. As long as Colorado keeps playing, Miller 
keeps coaching. 
</P>
<P>
Except, he's already been canned. Miller's team struggled through the regular 
season with a record of 10-17. It finished eighth in the Big Eight. The 
university president concurred with the director of athletics that Miller must 
go. They tried to withhold the news, but a TV station got hold of the story, so 
they had to give Miller his notice and go public. They did so a few days after 
he returned from his father's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Schembechler, Colorado did not decide to bring in a temporary. Leaving 
wasn't the coach's idea, as it was last season with Frieder taking a job with 
Arizona State while he was still employed by Michigan. Leaving was strictly the 
administration's idea. 
</P>
<P>
As Miller himself said: "I came to Colorado knowing that in big-time 
basketball, you either win or move on." 
</P>
<P>
Well, the plot thickens. After Saturday's 82-72 upset of Oklahoma State, 
coupled with Friday's 92-88 mega-upset of Missouri, the coach is suddenly Mr. 
Popularity. Suddenly, nobody from Boulder is eager to see him go. Suddenly, 
everybody wants this former West Point cadet to stick around, to start what he 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
These people include the Big Eight's leading scorer and rebounder, 6-foot-10 
junior center Shaun Vandiver, who is threatening to leave Colorado now that the 
coach has been dismissed. And the talkative Vandiver is still talking. After he 
lit up Oklahoma State for 26 points and 16 rebounds Saturday, Vandiver, unlike 
many intimidated schoolboy athletes, did not mince words. 
</P>
<P>
"If we win this tournament and make the NCAAs," Vandiver said, "the president 
and athletic director (at Colorado) are going to have their (tails) between 
their legs." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Miller, 41, is trying to enjoy all of this, but it's not easy. He's a 
tight-lipped guy by nature, a guy who tends to be leery of the media, a guy who 
played for Bob Knight at Army and coached under Knight at Indiana, a guy who 
was warned by Athletic Director Bill Marolt in 1988 that he would be fired if 
he kept grabbing or manhandling players at practice. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, much like Knight, Miller is a big believer in discipline, is 
dogged in his determination to make his players attend class and is concerned 
about the priorities of scholastic basketball, saying: "If you look at the 
college game, there are some strange things happening. You don't need to be a 
Rhodes scholar to figure it out. Is it a win-at-all-costs mentality, or what?" 
</P>
<P>
The coach got at least a partial answer after Colorado's victory over Missouri, 
when the university president, Gordon Gee, issued a written statement in 
Boulder congratulating Miller on his splendid achievement. One day, the guy's 
fired. Next day, he gets told what a good job he's doing. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, also like his mentor Knight, has a few eccentricities, superstitions, 
such as wearing the same lucky clothes. Knight is known for his crimson V-neck 
sweater. Miller wore the same faded pink shirt and droopy red necktie during 
both the Missouri and Oklahoma State games and is expected to have it on for 
today's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can't find a dry-cleaner open, I'll have to hand-wash it myself in the 
sink," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
He can be a character, a charmer, when he wants to be. When one of his 
forwards, Rodell (House) Guest, a notoriously bad shooter of free throws, came 
through with two in the clutch Saturday, Miller said: "I think he's on a tear. 
But don't get any ideas about shooting the ball after this, Rodell." 
</P>
<P>
Same as you-know-who, Miller trades friendly barbs with his players at news 
conferences, dares them to one-up him, re-directs questions to them, as when 
someone asked how Colorado's strength was holding up, having to play three 
difficult games in less than 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"How about it, you guys? You gonna have the strength to show up tomorrow?" 
Miller asked his players. 
</P>
<P>
"Si, senor," replied team joker Reggie Morton, a senior guard who can't speak 
Spanish except to order from a menu. 
</P>
<P>
Or when forward Brent Vaughan (from Bloomington, Ind., incidentally) spoke of 
what a pleasure it was to play before 17,000 cheering fans after averaging 
about 3,000 for home games at Colorado, Miller piped up and said: "What Brent 
doesn't understand was that those people who were cheering for us were OU-KU 
fans." 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma and Kansas, he meant self-deprecatingly, were rooting for a chance to 
play Colorado. They thought they could beat Colorado. Everybody in the Big 
Eight thought they could beat Colorado. Tom Miller's Colorado. Or at least what 
used to be Tom Miller's Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
"The coach is like a diamond in a rough mine," said Vandiver, who has his own 
way of putting things. "The guys who let him go, I guess they went with their 
own best thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
He wonders what they might be thinking next -- or where their heads might be 
when they're thinking it. "I still don't know if this is a fairy tale or a 
nightmare," Vandiver said. Neither does his coach.

ITO TRIPLE JUMPS TO SECOND PLACE BUT CAN'T CATCH TRENARY

Japan's Midori Ito proved again Saturday she is the best women's freestyle 
figure skater in the world. She may be better than any of the men, too. But 
Jill Trenary, a three-time U.S. champion, did not react well to suggestions 
that the gold medal from the World Championships should belong to anyone but 
her. 
</P>
<P>
"I won," said Trenary, 21, of Minnetonka, Minn. "I got the gold medal. 
Obviously, people think Midori is the best freestyle skater, and she is. But 
considering everything, I won. That's all I can say." 
</P>
<P>
It was a foregone conclusion entering Saturday's freestyle programs at the 
Halifax Metro Centre that Ito, the defending champion, would win that phase of 
the competition, which accounts for 50% of the final score. And she did. 
</P>
<P>
All Trenary, who was in third place in the overall standings when the day 
began, had to do to win the championship was finish second in the freestyle. 
And she did, becoming the fourth U.S. world champion since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Holly Cook of Bountiful, Utah, finished third and Kristi Yamaguchi of Fremont, 
Calif., was fourth. Never before has one country had three finishers among the 
top four skaters in the women's freestyle competition. 
</P>
<P>
But all three Americans combined could not land enough triple jumps to compete 
with the athleticism of Ito, who performed six triple jumps, including a triple 
axel with hang time Michael Jordan would have envied. No other woman has ever 
done a triple axel in competition. 
</P>
<P>
Ito had the top score on all nine judges' cards in the freestyle program and 
received perfect scores of 6.0 for technical merit from three of them. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing wrong with her performance, by her own admission, was that 
it was not as demanding as the one she did at last year's World Championships 
in Paris, where she received five perfect scores. But she has improved 
stylistically, which has been her weakness. 
</P>
<P>
She still cannot compete in that category with Trenary, who did what she had to 
do technically, landing four of five triple jumps without a mistake, and did it 
elegantly, receiving six 5.9s for artistic impression. Every judge had her 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Ito, who skated earlier, left the arena in tears after watching Trenary, 
knowing her title chances were gone, but she did not begrudge the American. 
</P>
<P>
"If I fall on my jumps, there is nothing," she said. "Jill is doing something 
every moment." 
</P>
<P>
Except for Ito and Trenary, the quality of skating was not exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
The most ambitious program belonged to Surya Bonaly, 16, the French champion 
who had eight triple jumps and a quadruple in her repertoire. The only person 
ever to land a quadruple in a major competition is men's champion Kurt Browning 
of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Bonaly crashed on her attempt. She had one other fall, a slip and looked more 
like a gymnast. But the judges rewarded her potential with scores that gave her 
ninth place overall. 
</P>
<P>
Cook's program was not particularly enthralling as she performed only two clean 
triple jumps. But after starting the day in second, she finished third by 
default. At 19, she is the first U.S. woman to win a medal in her first World 
Championships since 1947. 
</P>
<P>
Yamaguchi, 18, had a program with seven triple jumps, difficult enough that she 
could have won a medal if she had skated well. But she fell on her first two 
jumps. Because she regained her composure after the disastrous start, she still 
placed third in the freestyle program. But that left her in fourth overall. 
</P>
<P>
Ito would have won the championship if she had finished ninth or higher instead 
of 10th in Wednesday's compulsory figures, which count toward 20% of the final 
score. 
</P>
<P>
Even though she won the original program Friday and the freestyle program, Ito 
could not climb out of that rut. 
</P>
<P>
Trenary, who finished first in the figures and fifth in the original program, 
became the first champion since East Germany's Anett Poetzsch in 1980 to win 
neither of the free skating phases. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the compulsory figures have been eliminated, Trenary will have a 
difficult decision to make about whether to continue skating competitively 
through the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, or sign a lucrative 
contract with an ice show. 
</P>
<P>
If the figures were eliminated from this year's standings, the first three, in 
order, would have been Ito, Yamaguchi and Trenary. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, Bob Trenary, said they hope to make the decision soon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not whether she can win the World Championship again next year, it's 
whether she can be in front-running contention for a gold medal in 
Albertville," he said. "If she's got a 30 to 40% chance of winning, I think 
she'll stick around." 
</P>
<P>
Can she beat Ito in a free skating competition? 
</P>
<P>
"She's tough, but no one is perfect all the time," Trenary said. "She'll fall 
in practice like we all do. It's not like she's a robot, which is good. I won't 
make my decision based on one skater. It has to come from within, whether I can 
continue because I love skating."

NBA EXPERTS WOULD BE WIDE AWAKE ABOUT DRAFT SLEEPERS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: IF PICKS WERE MADE AGAIN, THE LAKERS' DIVAC WOULD GO FROM THE 
26TH CHOICE TO THE SECOND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a tough league to get a break in. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 27 players chosen in the first round of last summer's NBA draft, seven 
start and one quit the country altogether rather than negotiate with his team. 
</P>
<P>
Two personnel directors and a coach who participated in the draft were asked 
how the draft would go if it were held now: 
</P>
<P>
1. Sacramento Kings -- Danny Ferry. 
</P>
<P>
If the Kings had done this in the first place, it would have saved everyone a 
lot of trouble and Bill Russell would still be employed. Instead, they took 
Pervis Ellison. The Clippers, who hadn't worked Ferry out, took him and Ferry 
took a flight to Rome. 
</P>
<P>
2. Clippers -- Vlade Divac. 
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav 7-footer went No. 26 but has been impressive since. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened in the draft, nobody knew if they could get him," one of the 
three experts said. "There were rumors he was going into the Red Army. 
Middlemen were starting to call you from Yugoslavia, demanding money. If you 
were picking 1-10, you couldn't take that chance. If you were 15 to 26, you 
say, 'What the hell.' For the Lakers, it was a great pick." 
</P>
<P>
3. San Antonio Spurs -- Stacey King. 
</P>
<P>
King is coming on after a slow start with the Bulls, who were delighted to get 
him with the fourth pick. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a little weight problem early," an expert said. "He was pump-faking on 
every shot and getting a lot blocked. He must have missed his first 12 shots in 
the pros. He's 6-10, he can run, he can shot-block. I just think he has a 
tremendous upside." 
</P>
<P>
4. Miami Heat -- Glen Rice. 
</P>
<P>
This is where the Heat actually picked him. He is having a fair first season -- 
averaging 13.3 points, shooting 43.5% -- but everyone agrees he's a pro shooter 
with pro range. 
</P>
<P>
5. Charlotte Hornets -- J.R. Reid. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody else was quite this high on him but the Hornets wanted a Carolina 
player. He has averaged 11.8 points, and 8.7 rebounds, which puts him slightly 
outside the top 20. At 6-9 and 250, he's a big power forward trying to play 
center. There is some concern that although he is charming and intelligent, he 
may be too stubborn to learn anything. He improved little under Dean Smith, a 
great teacher. Everyone notes, "pro body." He loves contact, but people don't 
run away here. 
</P>
<P>
6. Chicago Bulls -- Pervis Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
This is where he should have gone, because he is a talented player who has to 
learn if he is a power forward or a small one. No one thinks he's a center. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand, Bill Russell could have perceived some of himself in 
this kid," one expert said. "He's a smallish (6-10) center with shot-blocking 
ability. Pervis is an intelligent kid. I don't know how driven a kid he is. We 
liked him. You don't like the body." 
</P>
<P>
Ellison is a wiry 210-pounder and there were concerns that he would injure 
easily. Sure enough, he has missed most of the season because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
7. Indiana Pacers -- Sean Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
He originally had a chance to go No. 1 overall, went third and, despite 
starting all season, hasn't shown a lot playing for the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Brown, the Spurs' coach, reportedly thinks Elliott is too nice, isn't big 
enough at 6-8 to be a small forward and would like to package him with Frank 
Brickowski for Danny Manning. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a good future but it's going to take time to develop," one expert says. 
</P>
<P>
Said another: "He's a finesse player who's going to have to learn to play with 
all the contact. He's learning to play with hands all over him." 
</P>
<P>
8. Dallas Mavericks -- Shawn Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
He is the other question-mark big man who would go a lot higher today. In the 
real draft, he went 17th overall, to Seattle, which was already a huge gamble. 
</P>
<P>
"Brilliant pick," one expert says. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-10, 235-pound, 19-year-old Kemp wasn't from faraway Yugoslavia, but 
nearby Indiana. Problems chased him to Trinity Valley Community College in 
Athens, Tex., and he hadn't really played since high school. 
</P>
<P>
Now, does he become Moses Malone or Darryl Dawkins? 
</P>
<P>
Says an expert: "I don't know what he's going to end up but if I was going to 
take a shot, I'd love taking it with an athlete and a guy with a body like he's 
got. I think he can be an awesome player. A little flaky kid, no doubt, but as 
an athlete, he has lottery skills." 
</P>
<P>
9. Washington Bullets -- Cliff Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
This 6-11 Connecticut star dropped all the way to No. 36, the ninth pick on the 
second round, where Portland nabbed him. 
</P>
<P>
"After his junior year, a lot of people thought he was a lottery pick," an 
expert says. "His senior year, he played like Brad Sellers. Everyone thought he 
was soft." 
</P>
<P>
Said another: "Great pickup for Portland. We missed him. I think the whole damn 
league missed him. The guy gets off more shots in less time than any rookie 
I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
10. Minnesota Timberwolves -- Pooh Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
It was a surprise when the Timberwolves made him the first point guard in the 
draft, but he has proved them right. Since becoming a starter, he is making 48% 
of his shots, averaging 15 points and nine assists and the Timberwolves are 
8-10. 
</P>
<P>
A charmer, he nevertheless turned some people off during workouts. One of the 
three experts thought he might be a con man. Another thought Richardson was too 
headstrong. He has had some tests of will with Coach Bill Musselman. 
</P>
<P>
Had anyone known how his shooting would improve -- he is at 38% from 
three-point range -- it wouldn't have been such a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
11. Orlando Magic -- Tim Hardaway. 
</P>
<P>
Another surprise, this 6-footer with no shooting range went to Golden State on 
the 14th pick and is now running No. 2 to David Robinson for rookie of the 
year. He is averaging 13.2 points, making 49% of his shots and is ninth in the 
league in assists at 8.1 per game. 
</P>
<P>
But could he play for anyone but Don Nelson, who spreads the floor? 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason, Nelly is pushing this kid," one expert says. 
</P>
<P>
(Nelson has called Hardaway the best point guard he has ever coached.) 
</P>
<P>
"I love his toughness and I'd love to have him on my team, but I'm not sure 
he's a starting guard in this league, and I'm sure he's not the best since 
(former Buck) Sidney Moncrief," the expert said. "I think Nelly will put 
Sharunas Marciulonis in that spot. I think he's building Hardaway up because he 
knows he needs big people up front and he wants to put him in a trade package." 
</P>
<P>
12. New Jersey Nets -- Sherman Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
Scouts had questions about his size and shooting. When he refused to attend 
postseason workouts or tournaments, he fell from the first round. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat got him with the first pick in the second round. One expert calls it 
"the best pick in the draft." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas is shooting 48%, averaging 14.1 points and 7.5 assists since becoming a 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's a quality young point guard," an expert said. "He delivers the 
ball. He's not a great shooter but he makes big shots all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Opinion is still split. Remember Mark Jackson's big rookie year for the New 
York Knicks? 
</P>
<P>
13. Boston Celtics -- Nick Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
He still is learning to play big guard, but is promising. 
</P>
<P>
14. Golden State Warriors -- Michael Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics were disappointed early, but made him a starter out of desperation. 
In six games since, he has averaged 16 points and shot 50%. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-10, he can pass and shoot. He still has detractors who say he is soft. 
</P>
<P>
15. Denver Nuggets -- Todd Lichti. 
</P>
<P>
They took him in real life and don't regret it. He's a tough, aggressive player 
who can shoot and drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Good, solid player who gives you 100%," an expert says. "A Hornacek-type 
player that we all need." 
</P>
<P>
16. Seattle SuperSonics -- Mookie Blaylock. 
</P>
<P>
He has the tools but the jury is still out on him as a playmaker. 
</P>
<P>
"I love his defense," an expert says. "I thought he'd be able to disrupt a 
game. And he always played with post players and he got the ball to them." 
</P>
<P>
Said another: "I think he'll be a good guard if his head's on straight -- and 
I'm not sure about that." 
</P>
<P>
17. Seattle SuperSonics -- Dana Barros. 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics shocked everyone by taking the 5-9 player here. Having seen 
him, they would do it again in a flash. 
</P>
<P>
He is popularizing a new position, the "shooting one," but he's a born scorer 
with three-point range. He had several 20-point games after stepping in for 
Dale Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
18. Chicago Bulls -- B.J. Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls wanted a point guard and took him, although they have found he is 
more shooter than playmaker. He is a good shooter, however, and they might try 
him again in hopes he will develop. 
</P>
<P>
19. Philadelphia 76ers -- Randy White. 
</P>
<P>
In real life, the 76ers threw this pick away on Kenny Payne, the Louisville 
sharpshooter everyone else had projected for the second round. 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers announced it live to a Spectrum crowd, which roundly booed it, 
prompting Coach Jim Lynam to grab a mike and angrily chastise his most devoted 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers still say Payne will make it. One expert says Payne "has CBA written 
all over him." 
</P>
<P>
There was a lot of Karl Malone-clone talk when White left Louisiana Tech, but 
the Mavericks, who took him in the lottery with the eighth pick, discovered 
that he is small for a power forward. There is still some thought that he can 
make it as a small forward. 
</P>
<P>
20. Chicago Bulls -- Dino Radja. 
</P>
<P>
He is another Yugoslav, the one who actually had to go into the army. 
</P>
<P>
He is a 6-10 power forward who, an expert says, "is a lot more physical than 
Divac, but not as talented. . . . He'll be a very good power forward." 
</P>
<P>
With two previous picks, the Bulls would have been in good position to gamble. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls actually drafted a small power forward, 6-8 Jeff Sanders of Georgia 
Southern, who was injured, hasn't played and might be a wasted choice. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics got Radja in the second round and he is supposed to join them next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
21. Utah Jazz -- Blue Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz took him the first time, too. A 6-5 forward, he started early but has 
been benched in favor of Thurl Bailey and will switch to big guard. 
</P>
<P>
22. Portland Trail Blazers -- Tommy Hammonds. 
</P>
<P>
See Randy White. He's another college power forward who will have to learn to 
face the basket and handle the ball. The Bullets picked him in the lottery with 
the ninth choice but he hasn't had much impact. Great body. Kind of a Ken 
Norman-type, and Norman learned. 
</P>
<P>
23. Atlanta Hawks -- George McCloud. 
</P>
<P>
He is another lottery pick -- Pacers, seventh -- who hasn't shown anything. A 
6-6 guard who handles the ball so well that he was once considered a possible 
point guard, he is a good outside shooter and still worth a look. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks actually took Roy Marble, who couldn't shoot, played poorly and then 
checked into drug rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
24. Phoenix Suns -- Byron Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't played much in Portland, but is tough, athletic and works hard. 
</P>
<P>
25. Cleveland Cavaliers -- Anthony Cook. 
</P>
<P>
The Arizona shot-blocker, playing in Europe, is still considered a prospect. 
</P>
<P>
26. Lakers -- Kenny Battle. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-5 runner-leaper who can't shoot, he might make sense for a fast-break team, 
in the absence of any other real prospect. 
</P>
<P>
This is the caliber of player one should expect with this pick. That is Divac 
was such a good pick by Jerry West, Laker general manager. 
</P>
<P>
27. Detroit Pistons -- Michael Ansley. 
</P>
<P>
Another undersized power forward. Starting to show a little in Orlando.

ARTESIA FREE THROWS BEAT GLENDORA; 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION II BOYS: PIONEER DEFENSE HOLDS OFF TARTANS' OUTSIDE SHOOTING TO REACH 
STATE FINAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After stopping Glendora's outside shooting, top-seeded Artesia took control of 
the game at the free-throw line in final quarter to defeat the Tartans, 57-44, 
in the boys' Southern Regional State Division II championship game before a 
crowd of 5,315 at the Sports Arena Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Artesia (28-2) made 13 of 14 free throws in the fourth quarter and 22 of 24 for 
the game to advance into Saturday's State final in Oakland, where it will play 
Sunnyvale Fremont, a 53-47 winner over Sacramento Jesuit in the Northern 
Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers knew that they had to stop Glendora's outside shooting, which had 
carried the Tartans to the Southern Section 4-AA Division title last week. 
</P>
<P>
Against Artesia, Glendora made only two of 21 three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"They lived and died with the three-point shot all season," Artesia Coach Wayne 
Merino said. "We knew we had to stop them from getting open shots." 
</P>
<P>
On offense, the Pioneers received balanced scoring, with senior 6-foot-8 
standout Ed O'Bannon leading the way with 18 points despite playing most of the 
game in foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"(The fouls) took me away from being more aggressive out there," said O'Bannon. 
"Hopefully, a game like this will help us in the finals next week." 
</P>
<P>
Glendora (28-6), which won the Southern Regional Division II title last season, 
led, 36-35, early in the fourth quarter. However, Artesia outscored the 
Tartans, 22-8, in the game's final seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Artesia guard DeAndre Austin scored 10 of his 14 points in the final quarter.

Gather around and listen, for there's good news this morning. Are you ready? 
"Clonehood" is curable. 
</P>
<P>
About two years ago, a restaurant called Sostanza opened on Wilshire with a 
menu that resembled Prego's . . . a lot. It resembled it right down to the 
typography. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, the restaurant has never looked like Prego. A garish mural of a 
Medieval Italian horse race covers one wall right up the unusually high 
ceiling. That mural is cloned from one in a New York restaurant called Palio. 
But, not long ago the kitchen got a new boss, a former sous-chef at Chianti 
Cucina and Locanda Veneta, and the menu he's put together is distinctly new. 
</P>
<P>
His style is a little hard to pinpoint. For instance, he makes mussels and 
clams in white wine sauce flavored with garlic and saffron (frutti di mare en 
guazzetto), nothing unusual except that this huge bowlful is an appetizer. He 
uses imported prosciutto, pale pink and wonderfully delicate in flavor, but 
it's for an appetizer of prosciutto with dates instead of melons, not at all a 
bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
My somewhat reluctant vote for the best appetizer is the polpettine misteriose: 
turkey meatballs in a purplish-brown sauce of wine, meat juices and sweet onion 
marmalade. It is not so much misterioso as capricious, but grows on you. 
</P>
<P>
There's a short list of pizzas. They have crisp, thin crusts and standard 
Westside toppings, the most exotic being rosemary and moderately thin slices of 
potato on the cheese and tomato sauce base. The pasta list is long by 
comparison, and the menu is organized to suggest that you have pasta as a 
second course, between the appetizers and the meat course. 
</P>
<P>
Having a meat course afterward is probably wise unless you distinctly plan to 
eat light, because the pasta portions are semi-dainty. For instance, the 
lobster-filled ravioli allo zafferano is in a particularly luscious saffron 
cream sauce. Then there's the somewhat riskier choice of tortelloni agli 
asparagi, in which the pasta is filled with ricotta but served in a sauce of 
pureed asparagus and probably a little olive oil. It's more subtle than saffron 
and cream, and it's lighter and fresher. 
</P>
<P>
The steak is in the finest tradition of huge Italian steaks and probably the 
best thing on the menu. It's an aged Porterhouse covered with red wine sauce 
flavored with rosemary and black olives (California ripe ones, not any of the 
more powerful Italian kinds). Actually, it's half-covered. The delicate filet 
portion is thoughtfully left nude. 
</P>
<P>
The next best thing is costolette svitate, a baby rack of lamb in peanut sauce. 
This is not one of the flamboyant Southeast Asian peanut sauces, though, but a 
classicizing and distinctly European one, mostly wine and meat juices with just 
a hint of peanut flavoring. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison the other meat entrees are nowhere near so flashy. The braised 
lamb shanks (agnello alle manzane) are cooked well-done, soft enough to cut 
with a spoon, but the sauce of eggplant chunks in a little tomato sauce is 
somehow drab. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, there's a ricotta cheesecake of unparalleled creaminess that is 
positively rich. A chocolate torte made with red wine tastes like a huge 
chocolate truffle candy with a little winy bite to it. The mandarin orange tart 
might have been made with fresh tangerines. 
</P>
<P>
Good work, Sostanza. Go forth and clone no more. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: polpettine misteriose, $6.95; ravioli allo zafferano, 
$10.50; bistecca del mangione, $17.95; costolette svitate, $17.95; ricotta 
cheesecake, $5.

THEATER NOTEBOOK: 'FLAME'S CALL' IGNITES INSIGHTS BY PORTRAYING EVERYDAY 
CHARACTERS

"There are no heads or tails in theater of the absurd," pronounced Nitza Henig, 
two of whose plays are included in a trio of one-acts opening this weekend at 
the Shepard Theatre Complex in Hollywood under the title of one of them, 
"Flame's Call." 
</P>
<P>
Her first piece, "Repercussions," deals with the triangle of a mother, father 
and grown daughter, a relationship unfolded in a series of letters. "After a 
child leaves home, what's left?," asked Henig, an Israeli native. The 
monologues, she said -- "hopefully like a long poem" -- revolve around "looking 
to the past and trying to reach an understanding. Of course parents make 
mistakes; we're all imperfect. That's reality." 
</P>
<P>
Her longer piece, "Flame's Call," also uses everyday characters as metaphors 
for larger issues. "It's a black comedy, based on a woman who has a little job 
in a hospital, who's looking for love -- everywhere and anywhere," she said. 
"Her emotions are bigger than life, and love is a very strong need." 
</P>
<P>
A former actress and director who founded Minneapolis' experimental Theatre 
From the Center in 1978, Henig's immersion in writing seven months ago has 
resulted in three plays. She will see another of her works, "Strange Voyage," 
staged at the Burbage in April. 
</P>
<P>
The middle piece of the evening is Samuel Beckett's "Rockaby." "It's about a 
woman who sits in a rocking chair listening to voices," Henig said. "For people 
who like strange theater, it's a good piece to see. But Beckett is not very 
optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
Also this month: 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday: Maurice Noel's "Canaan Land," whose characters include "an aging 
stripper . . . and a tart in a wheelchair" opens at the Cast-at-the-Circle 
Theatre in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Italian actor Dario D'Ambrosi returns to Hollywood's Stages Trilingual Theatre 
in his acclaimed "Nemico Mio" (Enemy of Mine) and, on March 20, in a new work, 
"La Trota" (The Trout). Both will be performed in English. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday: Van Nuys' California Cottage Theatre opens Roy Brocksmith's "Heddy!," 
a seven-character musical drama "freely adapted" from Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler." 
</P>
<P>
In North Hollywood, Group Repertory plays host to a revival of Noel Coward's 
"Present Laughter," about the comic trials of an English theater star. 
</P>
<P>
Friday: Studio City's Theatre West presents its second annual Theatre West 
Fest, a seven-week festival featuring 16 pieces generated in the theater's 
acting, writing and directing workshops. 
</P>
<P>
Caroline Kava's "The Early Girl," a seriocomic character study set in a house 
of prostitution, gets a revival at the Attic Theatre in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The five members of the Supreme Court who voted to uphold the Georgia sodomy 
statute are kidnaped and put on trial in Charles A. Larson's "To Be Left 
Alone," premiering at the Burbage Theatre in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday: Just in time for St. Patrick's Day, Raymond Galvin's "Spite the Devil 
for Awhile," a six-character comedy about an Irish immigrant family in 1940s 
New Jersey, makes its premiere at Theatre/Theater in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday: Harold Gould is Sigmund "Freud" in Lynn Roth's one-man biographical 
drama, playing three performances only at the University of Judaism's Gindi 
Auditorium in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
March 19: After a six-year absence, the famed improv troupe "War Babies" will 
be reunited for a three-night benefit for director Ted Schmitt at the Cast 
Theatre. "This Time It's Personal" stars Maryedith Burrell, Caren Kaye, Susan 
Krebs, Marsha Meyers, Jed Mills, Renny Temple and John Welsh. 
</P>
<P>
March 20: Twenty-one years after its New York debut (which featured Larry 
Hagman), Jay and Fran Landesman's "The Nervous Set" -- billed as "the only 
beatnik musical revival and updated with rearranged music" -- opens at the 
Heliotrope Theatre in Hollywood. Tommy Wolf wrote the music. 
</P>
<P>
March 21: Fresh from an appearance at the White House, Joe Sears and Jaston 
Williams return to Los Angeles with tales of Tuna, "the third-smallest city in 
Texas," in their long-running, long-touring comedy hit, "Greater Tuna," opening 
at the Westwood Playhouse.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
ARIZONA WILDERNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 356 to 45, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 2570) setting 
aside 1.1 million Bureau of Land Management acres in Arizona as federal 
wilderness to be permenantly protected against degradation. 
</P>
<P>
The measure opens an additional 950,000 BLM acres to uses such as mining and 
grazing. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of a series of bills Congress has taken up in recent years to 
preserve large wilderness areas in most states. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Morris Udall (D-Ariz.) said people should have "the strength, the 
courage and the wisdom to leave at least these places as we found them." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bob Stump (R-Ariz.) called the bill "an overzealous effort to protect 
public lands from human intrusion." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the wilderness bill.

WALKOUTS AT CENTINELA: RACISM OR OFFICIAL INCOMPETENCE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY and SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mannequin in the classroom had been mutilated. It was black. And to 
Hawthorne High School Principal Ken Crowe, that was racist. 
</P>
<P>
But to some white teachers, the one-time movie prop was nothing more than a 
teaching tool. For 10 years it had been used in the school's "Film as 
Literature" class to illustrate how special effects can distort reality. Crowe, 
who is black, confiscated it last year, charging that it was just one more 
example of ongoing racial harassment in the Centinela Valley Union High School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
The mannequin, which had been disfigured for use in the movie "Coma," has come 
to symbolize two years of racial allegations in the district. It also is a 
telling metaphor for tensions that erupted last week at its two high schools in 
student protests over Crowe's forced resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Are the schools plagued by bigotry from a handful of white teachers who, as one 
district official put it, "are still living in the '50s?" Or perhaps is racism 
simply being used as a special effect of its own -- a smoke screen for 
incompetence among school administrators who happen to be black? 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were away from this in America," said parent Sherry Wingo, whose 
teen-age son is on the baseball team at Lawndale's Leuzinger High. She said the 
week's events have left her outraged and confused. 
</P>
<P>
"The name calling, the looking at each other's skin. It's sad that these 
allegations are being made. It's even sadder if they're true." 
</P>
<P>
A state mediator has been dispatched from the Department of Education to ferret 
out the answers. And local political leaders hurriedly gathered Friday to 
develop a strategy to ease tensions. 
</P>
<P>
But on a deeper level, education experts say problems at Centinela -- genuine 
or contrived -- stem from dramatic demographic changes that have taken place in 
the past decade at school districts statewide. 
</P>
<P>
"This, regrettably, is simply a characteristic of our times at the end of the 
20th Century in California, " said James Guthrie, a professor of education at 
UC Berkeley who is regarded as one of the state's foremost authorities on 
education policy. "This is a period of unusually intense racial conflict, and 
there is no better illustration of it than in our schools." 
</P>
<P>
At odds, Guthrie and others say, are rapidly changing student bodies, school 
boards that reflect a changing ethnic mix, the advancement of non-whites to 
high-level administrative posts and increasingly exacting teachers unions. 
</P>
<P>
All those factors have come into play at Centinela Valley, which has undergone 
a demographic revolution in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
The district has seen its share of non-white students soar from 45% in 1980-81 
to more than 80% today, with 52% of all students now Latino. In the past 
decade, the combined population of Hawthorne, Lawndale and Lennox -- the 
communities that feed students to the district -- has gone from mostly white to 
mostly non-white. In an election last fall in which the district's racial 
problems became an issue, voters elected a school board that is now dominated 
by Latinos rather than whites. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the district's controversial top administrator, Supt. McKinley Nash, 
is a black man who last year confronted an overwhelmingly white faculty in an 
acrimonious contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The mix has been a volatile one, not only in Centinela Valley but in other 
school districts, said UC Berkeley's Guthrie. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions recently erupted, for example, in the Oakland schools, which have a 
predominantly black administration and a predominantly white faculty. Amid 
charges of corruption, mismanagement and academic failure on the part of 
administrators, the Legislature took the unprecedented step last fall of 
appointing a state overseer to monitor the administration. The move immediately 
spawned allegations of racism on the part of white state officials and 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Guthrie said the picture is complicated by the increasing statewide militancy 
of teachers unions in the wake of the successful Los Angeles Unified School 
District teachers strike last year that netted teachers a hefty pay raise and a 
new say in district policy-making. In districts such as Centinela -- where the 
faculty and administration are of different ethnic backgrounds -- rancor over 
issues such as school management and pay can easily be confused by underlying 
racial tension, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie Oakes, associate professor of education at UCLA and an authority on 
school administration, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always suspicious when charges of racism come up because as I watched 
people in schools throughout the state . . . I don't see a lot of overtly 
racist stuff going on," Oakes said. "But when other issues cause tension -- 
when educational issues or policy questions come into play -- then these kinds 
of charges seem to rear their heads." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the teachers at Centinela Valley say that tension is the crux of their 
problems, and they say the cries of racism did not surface in earnest until 
last year's contract dispute, when teachers began challenging Nash and some of 
the blacks he appointed to top positions. 
</P>
<P>
"They are using racial issues to cover up what essentially is a 
labor-management dispute," said John Wheeler, a social studies teacher at 
Hawthorne High School. 
</P>
<P>
But other people say the racism is sadly real. 
</P>
<P>
There have been 40 alleged incidents of racial harassment -- involving 
administrators, teachers and students -- at Centinela's two high schools in the 
past two years, Nash said. They cover a broad spectrum, ranging from 
allegations of white teachers referring to black students as intellectually 
inferior to black teachers and administrators receiving racially offensive 
cartoons and notes. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents, almost everyone agrees, began about two years ago when Crowe, 
then an assistant principal, was promoted to principal at Hawthorne High, where 
most of the racial allegations have arisen. Crowe, who announced his 
resignation on Feb. 27 after being told the school board intended to remove 
him, insists that he has been the victim of systematic harassment by a small 
group of white teachers. The board gave Crowe no official reason for his 
removal, but one member said it was because of his "management style." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel there are some (whites) who don't want to take orders from minorities," 
said former school board member Ann Birdsall, who was a strong supporter of 
both Crowe and Nash before being ousted in last fall's elections. 
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum to Nash early this year, Crowe detailed "a series of 
discriminatory incidents" at the school, some of which, he wrote, "have been 
clear violations of my civil rights as an American citizen." In his resignation 
letter to the school board last month, Crowe complained about "the racist 
attitude of some of the Hawthorne High School staff." 
</P>
<P>
Crowe's allegations were supported by an investigation by the school district 
that concluded in January. 
</P>
<P>
"There was really an ingrained redneck element," said attorney Melanie Lomax, a 
black attorney who led the investigation. "Ken Crowe and other minority 
administrators were constantly being harassed and denigrated and having double 
standards applied to them. Their authority was questioned every five minutes in 
ways that appeared to be connected to who they were in terms of their race." 
</P>
<P>
But many teachers aren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, for example, when Rudy Crew became the first black principal in 
Hawthorne High's history, teachers said they had none of the problems that have 
occurred since Crowe took the post. Union organizer Lauren Sanders said 
teachers liked Crew so much, in fact, that he asked Crew to reconsider his 
decision in 1983 to move to a job in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a wonderful time at Hawthorne High School," said Crew, who now is 
superintendent at Sacramento City Unified School District. Crew said there were 
initial "concerns" about his taking over as principal in 1980, but they 
"quickly vanished once I got to the campus to work with kids." 
</P>
<P>
Crew, a friend of Supt. Nash, said he got along well with the faculty, which 
was then, too, mostly white. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a good school with so much potential," he said. "I'm really 
surprised that these issues are unresolved." 
</P>
<P>
Crew's success, teachers say, underscores their argument that the problem is 
Crowe's competence -- not his color. They say Crowe and his boss, Nash, have 
intentionally twisted legitimate concerns about their performance into 
outlandish accusations of racism. When some teachers challenged the dismissal 
of a popular white Hawthorne High drama teacher last year, for example, Crowe 
complained of racial overtones. Teachers say they were simply defending a 
deserving colleague. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is all made up," said Nancy Nuesseler, a Leuzinger High social 
studies teacher and president of the teachers union. "I am not saying that 
everything here is perfect. But I don't believe any of us are racists. You 
could not survive here if you were racists, with over 80% minority enrollment. 
You have to love all kids to survive in this place." 
</P>
<P>
Some teachers have gone so far as to say that Nash may have encouraged some 
students to walk out of classes last week. A week before the demonstrations, 
Nash made comments about racism at a student assembly that teacher Debbie 
Douglas said "laid a poisonous seed in fertile grounds." 
</P>
<P>
The special education teacher, and others, said the talk appeared to give some 
students permission to protest. On Friday, several dozen Leuzinger High 
teachers signed a petition, aimed at Nash and his supporters, urging that 
criminal charges be filed against adults who encouraged the demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
According to teachers at Hawthorne High, Nash told students that the problem of 
racism in Hawthorne and in the Centinela Valley Union High School District is 
worse today than it was in the '60s in the Deep South. 
</P>
<P>
Nash acknowledged that he spoke about racism during a special assembly 
commemorating Black Heritage Month, but he characterized as "ridiculous" the 
claims that he may have incited students. 
</P>
<P>
"I had nothing to say about Centinela or Hawthorne," he said. "The kids weren't 
riled at all." 
</P>
<P>
Parents, meanwhile, are furious that students have been pulled into what they 
view as an adult dispute. "I know I speak for a lot of my friends when I say I 
would like some answers," said Bonnie Miller, whose daughter is a cheerleader 
at Hawthorne High. 
</P>
<P>
Newly elected school board member Pam Sturgeon, who ran with strong teacher 
support and as a critic of the superintendent, said parents aren't alone in 
their outrage. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these kids don't even realize what is behind all of this," Sturgeon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But some parents say it is Sturgeon and her fellow school board members who are 
to blame. Sharon Ratliff, whose son, Malcolm, helped organize protests at 
Leuzinger, said many blacks tried to warn the board over the past several 
months that racial tensions were running high. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been going to meetings since December, and they don't want to hear what 
you have to say," Ratliff said. "If the board had listened, all of us could 
have come together and worked this out. But when they don't listen, you have to 
turn to the community and the students for assistance." 
</P>
<P>
Sturgeon, who said her life has been threatened in the past week, said it is 
unfair to blame the newly elected board for problems that have plagued the 
district for years. She said the former board, which strongly supported the 
superintendent and his administrators, should shoulder the responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have called for these investigations and dealt with all of the 
allegations out in the open," Sturgeon said. "Most of the allegations coming 
from the black community about racism took place before the new board members 
even thought of running for the board." 
</P>
<P>
But former board member Birdsall, who lost her seat in November, said the board 
did attempt to lessen tensions by hiring Lomax to look into the complaints. She 
criticized the new board for not acting more decisively on recommendations to 
defuse tensions that were made in January by Lomax. 
</P>
<P>
"My fear is for the kids," Birdsall said. "They are the ones being hurt by all 
of this." 
</P>
<P>
Board President Ruth Morales, who was first elected to the board in 1979, said 
neither board is to blame. She said the former board worked behind the scenes 
to reduce tensions, and the current board has not been given a chance by the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of people coming to help or offering solutions, if you were at the 
board meetings, you would see they are making constant accusations," Morales 
said. "We are trying, but you can't do much when the climate is like this." 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), who organized a meeting Friday of 
local officials concerned about the allegations, said district officials have 
been naive. "People wanted to protect the status quo," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the turmoil, school officials are looking for long-term 
solutions to racial tensions in the most likely of places: the classroom. Among 
other things, officials are preparing an application to the state Department of 
Education for a grant to begin a human relations course for ninth-graders. 
State legislation establishing the grant program states that the curriculum 
must promote "positive interaction" among racial and ethnic groups and should 
teach the dangers of stereotypes and discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we can help ourselves with this," Nash said. "It is the one mechanism 
that is crucial when you have the kind of ethnicity changes we have: to have 
people communicate."

COMPLAINTS ABOUT GARDEN ICE RESURFACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT FACHET, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Complaints about the ice in Madison Square Garden have been prevalent for 15 
years, since the Rangers' Dale Rolfe caught a skate in a rut and fractured an 
ankle that ended his career. 
</P>
<P>
The situation escalated within the past week, as both the Boston Bruins and New 
York Islanders protested that the Garden surface was too dangerous for proper 
play. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders claimed after a 6-3 loss that three players had been injured 
because of the poor ice -- Derek King with a twisted knee and Jeff Norton and 
Patrick Flatley with aggravations of strained abdominal muscles. 
</P>
<P>
The ice was resurfaced twice during the first intermission, resulting in a 
lengthy delay. When Islanders Coach Al Arbour protested again during the second 
intermission, he was assessed an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty by referee Rob 
Shick. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers broke a 3-3 tie with a goal on the ensuing power play. Afterward, 
General Manager Bill Torrey had to restrain Arbour from going after Shick. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (supervisor of officials) Matt Pavelich that the players shouldn't be 
on that ice," Torrey told The New York Times. "The referee and one of the 
linesmen agreed with me. They said it was the worst they had ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
The Boston game was delayed before the start when the ice was ordered 
resurfaced a second time, following complaints by Coach Mike Milbury. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to figure out what is wrong have left people scratching their heads. 
Between the Boston and Islanders games, the Washington Capitals played at the 
Garden and Coach Terry Murray said: "When we were there, the ice was great. The 
guys knew there had been problems and they commented about how good it was." 
</P>
<P>
Murray wishes the ice had been that good one night in 1972 when he suffered a 
broken leg while playing for the California Golden Seals. 
</P>
<P>
"I was coming back into our end real hard, I caught my skate in a rut and fell 
into the goalpost," Murray recalled. "I broke my leg and it definitely was 
because of the ice." 
</P>
<P>
Professional hockey is returning to Richmond, where the Washington Capitals had 
an American League affiliate 15 years ago and where Murray played as a farmhand 
of the Philadelphia Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
The new entry will be an expansion club in the rapidly expanding East Coast 
Hockey League, which currently features eight teams spread from Erie, Pa., in 
the north to Nashville, in the west. 
</P>
<P>
The easternmost link is in Norfolk, where the surprising success of the Hampton 
Roads Admirals -- guided by former Toronto coach John Brophy -- prompted 
Richmond interests to host a transplanted league match last week between 
Hampton Roads and Winston-Salem. 
</P>
<P>
When 9,000 persons turned up at Richmond Coliseum, it was decided to move ahead 
with a franchise in Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
Latest candidate to put on a spurt in the Calder Trophy race for NHL rookie of 
the year is Darren Turcotte of the New York Rangers. Turcotte had registered 
nine goals in his previous seven games. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been a streaky player," Turcotte said. "The streaks just never 
lasted this long before." 
</P>
<P>
Turcotte, recently returned to his natural center position after struggling on 
the wing, leads all rookies with 28 goals. When he recorded his second NHL hat 
trick against Boston last week, fans littered the ice with gym bags they had 
received as a promotional giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
Turcotte celebrated his 22nd birthday Friday. If he wins the Calder, he would 
be the second consecutive American winner -- teammate Brian Leetch was honored 
last year -- and the third in five years (Calgary's Gary Suter won it in 1986).

This is the easy time to be mean. Go ahead. Call for rolling heads and sweeping 
indictments and houses scrubbed squeaky clean. Who will question it? Things 
have gone too far, yes? Of course they must fire Jim Valvano. Of course they 
must tidy up that mess at North Carolina State. Of course, it is a perfect 
example of all that is wrong with college athletics. 
</P>
<P>
So what do we do? Time to get hard, yes? Time to crack down. The media swarm 
must circle. Charles Shackleford. Vinny Del Negro. Coach V. Maybe they did, 
maybe they didn't. Get their names on the air. Stain their reputations before 
anyone really knows what's going on. Bring their heads on a plate. Easy time to 
be mean. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't new. This isn't something we haven't seen before. This doesn't move 
us forward at all. Gamblers and dropped passes and cash and maybe even that 
acrid stink of drugs -- this just pushes us back again. For some old-timers, it 
shoves them all the way to 1962, when a national point-shaving scandal rocked 
the nation. For others, though, the mind slips a few cogs back to 1985, when a 
school self-destructed and everyone cracked down and an innocent man named "Hot 
Rod" saw his life going to ashes. 
</P>
<P>
In late March of that year, police in New Orleans began arresting suspects. 
Eight Tulane University basketball players were indicted in a point-shaving 
scandal involving three games. Forward John Williams alone faced three counts 
of conspiring to fix games and two counts of sports bribery -- charges that, if 
proved true, could carry a maximum penalty of 17 years in prison and a $35,000 
fine. A second indictment charged a Tulane student with selling cocaine to 
members of the team. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, things got even worse. Sports Illustrated reported that Williams 
and other players received payments from alumni boosters. On the stand, 
Williams revealed that he had received, as a high school senior, a shoe box 
filled with $10,000 cash from a Tulane recruiter. The head coach, Ned Fowler, 
was found to have been making weekly cash payments to his players. 
</P>
<P>
The year after wasn't very good for everyone involved. Along with Fowler, more 
than five dozen people in the athletic department and its support staff either 
resigned or found themselves fired or reassigned. The basketball program was 
disbanded. Williams, considered a sure Top-Twenty pick in the NBA draft -- and 
the benefit of the millions that would go to such a talent -- suddenly had no 
takers. The Cleveland Cavaliers gambled and took him in the second round, but 
few believed he would ever play an NBA minute. 
</P>
<P>
Five years have passed since all that. You'd think John "Hot Rod" Williams, now 
a productive member of the Cavaliers, would have put it behind him by now. But 
when asked what he thought about the developments at N.C. State after a 
practice Wednesday at the College of Alameda, Williams' first reaction was a 
strong denial of having any involvement. He hasn't, obviously, been accused of 
any such thing. The scars haven't faded. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't believe everything you hear, so it was no big deal to me," he said. 
"Whatever happens in that situation, it's not me, there's nothing I can do 
about it. I don't know what's going on. It's something I don't really think I 
can tell you about. My lawyer probably knows more than I do." 
</P>
<P>
Williams never played his rookie year in the NBA. His first day in court, in 
August of 1985, ended in a mistrial because of prosecutorial misconduct. The 
Cavs paid his legal expenses, but the NBA forced them to withdraw his contract 
because his name still hadn't been cleared. He made $15,000 playing summer ball 
for the Rhode Island Gulls of the U.S. Basketball League. He never allowed 
himself to get depressed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should something get you down when you know you haven't done anything at 
all?" he said. "Only losers have a reason to complain. I knew I wasn't a loser. 
I knew I was always a winner, so I always kept my head up." 
</P>
<P>
But it was a long year, regardless, the longest of his life. He went to the 
Cavs' home games, watched from the stands as the men who should have been his 
teammates played the game he should have been playing. People would point at 
him, and whisper, and wonder. On June 18, 1986, the wondering ended. A six-man 
jury unanimously found Williams, the only Tulane player ever brought to trial, 
innocent of all five charges. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, he's heard all about N.C. State in the past week. Point-shaving and 
gambling and payoffs. (begin italics) You can't believe everything you hear. 
(end italics) 
</P>
<P>
"That happened five years ago, and it's really something that I put behind me 
and said I would never look back," said Williams. "If I look back, it'll 
probably be in my book someday. But through the whole situation, John Williams 
never said a word. I didn't even have to say a word in the courthouse when 
everybody else told their story. People never heard my side of the story. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just something that's happened, and now with that guy at State? It's just 
a situation that's hard to explain. It's just something you go through. And I 
think that guy has the same thing. He's just got to get him his date in the 
courthouse." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he tries not to think much about his ordeal, but he admits it was 
difficult at times to avoid despair. "In ways it was, but really, I've put all 
that behind me. It don't even bother me, everything's going good for me. I 
thank the good Lord, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
Scandal at N.C. State. 
</P>
<P>
Easy time to be mean. 
</P>
<P>
Easy time for everyone, it seems, but John Williams, Class of '85.

DAVID WHEATON STARTS TO MAKE TENNIS MARK 
</P>

<P>
David Wheaton finally is catching up with Andre Agassi and Michael Chang. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few years ago, they were considered three child prodigies of American 
tennis. But after winning the 1987 Junior U.S. Open, Wheaton languished while 
his counterparts flourished. 
</P>
<P>
While Agassi was ranked 24th on the men's tennis tour at age 17 in November 
1987, an 18-year-old Wheaton was at Stanford, adjusting to his growing body and 
transforming his style of play from baseline to serve-and-volley. 
</P>
<P>
When Chang stunned the tennis world at age 17 by winning the 1989 French Open, 
a 19-year-old Wheaton was putting behind him a year of frustration and doubts 
after a nearly career-ending wrist injury suffered in a freak accident. 
</P>
<P>
But at 20, Wheaton finally is catching his peers, and his goal this year is to 
join Agassi (No. 8) and Chang (No. 7) in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't been an easy road for me," Wheaton said. "It's been a long road." 
</P>
<P>
But Wheaton believes his slow, steady ascent not only will take him to No. 1, 
but also keep him there longer than teen-agers who have risen much more 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"You're building a foundation by getting experience, playing matches and 
working your way up steadily," Wheaton said. "I think that's a safer way . . . 
instead of just shooting up there on a few big wins and then just kind of 
falling down real quick." 
</P>
<P>
He's already realized one 1990 goal: making a Grand Slam quarterfinal when in 
January he reached the final eight of the Australian Open in the best finish by 
an American. 
</P>
<P>
He was ranked 27th in the world by the Association of Tennis Professionals late 
last month, but had slipped to 35th this week. 
</P>
<P>
"He can be the best player in the world," Jerry Noyce, an unofficial coach of 
Wheaton since Wheaton was 11, said at the St. Louis Park health club where 
Wheaton works out when he comes home to Deephaven. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a tremendous desire to be No. 1. I see him in the top 10 in the next 
couple of months. He is sort of a secret in his own country, but that won't 
last too long." 
</P>
<P>
People have been saying such things about Wheaton most of his life. 
</P>
<P>
He began playing at age 4, and won the Minnesota boys' state singles 
championship as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Then he won four junior national titles and was the second-ranked junior in the 
world in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But by then, not close to the 6-foot-4, 175-pound body he has today, Wheaton 
began having trouble holding his own against his peers. 
</P>
<P>
So, instead of turning pro, he went to Stanford, where Cardinal Coach Dick 
Gould noticed his 115-m.p.h. serve and changed his style to serve-and-volley. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my game takes a little longer to develop," Wheaton said. "You don't 
see many serve-and-volleyers who make it young. It's more of an experience 
thing. You have to learn to play around the net." 
</P>
<P>
Wheaton learned quickly. He competed in the singles and doubles finals in his 
first tournament as a Stanford freshman, the Volvo All-American, which included 
most of the best collegiate players. 
</P>
<P>
But his career nearly slammed to a stop after a freak rollerblading accident in 
December 1987. Traveling faster than he realized as he rolled up to knock on a 
dorm window, he cut two tendons and a nerve in his wrist as his left arm broke 
through the window. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like someone had taken a knife and tried to murder me," said Wheaton, a 
right-hander who hits a two-handed backhand. "There was a hole in my wrist the 
size of a half dollar." 
</P>
<P>
There was some question whether Wheaton would lose the use of his left hand, 
but two months later he was practicing his forehand and by mid-March he was 
working on his backhand. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty sad. I thought, 'There goes another case of a kid not making it, 
burning out,' " Wheaton said. "Even to this day, I still don't have feeling in 
a large part of my hand. If it was my right hand, it would have been a 
career-ending injury." 
</P>
<P>
Wheaton came back to lead Stanford to the 1988 NCAA men's tennis championship, 
and was named the NCAA rookie of the year. But his wrist was still weak and he 
lacked confidence in his backhand. 
</P>
<P>
Wheaton's troubles showed when he turned pro in the summer of 1988. He was 
ranked 863rd at one point late that year. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty bad for a while," he said. "I wasn't hitting my backhand 
normally until the end of 1988. I was depressed after the summer. I didn't want 
to play tennis anymore." 
</P>
<P>
But after taking time to refocus, Wheaton began his steady improvement by 
winning three of his first seven 1989 matches. 
</P>
<P>
He won the Brasilia Challenger in April and moved from 214th in the world to 
111th. At the Grand Prix in Stratton Mountain in August, he beat Agassi and Jim 
Courier before losing to Brad Gilbert in the semifinals. That put him at No. 
60. He finished 1989, his first full year on the pro circuit, with $122,043 in 
winnings. 
</P>
<P>
"Things started slowly to get back together," Wheaton said. "Learning to win 
again was a big thing for me." 
</P>
<P>
Wheaton began making a national name for himself at the 1990 Australian Open, 
where he swept Aaron Krickstein in the fourth round before losing to Stefan 
Edberg in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Now that he's beaten players like Agassi, once a classmate of his at the Nick 
Bollettieri Tennis Academy, and Krickstein, Wheaton wants to beat some of the 
world's top five players. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm physically ready to play at that level," he said. "I can 
definitely hit the ball with these guys, but it's just a mental thing now. That 
comes from experience -- winning a lot."

PAC-10 TOURNAMENT: WHY BOTHER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Arizona's recent resurgence notwithstanding, the Pacific 10 Conference is going 
to have difficulty convincing the NCAA Basketball Tournament Selection 
Committee its conference ranks with the nation's elite. For awhile, the 
Pac-10's balance was its strength this season, but the way the Wildcats have 
made a shambles of games down the stretch has altered that notion considerably. 
</P>
<P>
For all practical purposes, the Pac-10 tournament championship game scheduled 
for Sunday at ASU is a foregone conclusion. Arizona has won its last nine 
Pac-10 games by an average of 21.2 points and should have a home-court 
advantage as fans make the 100-mile trip north from Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
There's really nothing to prove this weekend. The Pac-10's prime contenders for 
an invitation to the NCAA party can only damage their chances by playing an 
anticlimactic tournament. Hats off to the Pac-10 presidents for having the 
wisdom to terminate it. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the ACC or the Big East, where fans go into a frenzy over 
basketball. Those postseason tournaments gave everyone ideas, but the 
atmosphere simply isn't the same in the West. Have you been to a game at USC or 
ASU lately? UCLA's fans are like programmed robots. They show up, but they 
don't really seem to care. Except for places like Tucson, Berkeley, Corvallis, 
Las Vegas and Goleta, there isn't much intensity or emotion for college hoops. 
</P>
<P>
Even Lute Olson, who has done a masterful job bringing back his young Wildcats 
from an 0-2 conference start to a co-championship, wants no part of the Pac-10 
tourney. In fact, he suggests his team's comeback may not have been necessary 
if there was no conference tourney. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the tourney," Olson explained, "we had to make a tough Pac-10 trip 
to Oregon in early December. Now, without a tournament next year, we'll be able 
to play our conference games when we should, after the first of the year." 
</P>
<P>
The inference is that the Wildcats might not have suffered back-to-back defeats 
at the Oregons, Nov. 30-Dec. 2, if the games had been played four or five weeks 
later. But at least the Pac-10 had an opportunity to delude itself about parity 
while Dr. Olson required more time to create his monster. Oregon State had a 
chance to tie for the title, and Cal likely will land in the NCAA tournament 
for the first time in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
That's a healthy situation, of course, but the public shouldn't be swayed into 
thinking the Pac-10 is a powerhouse. All of its top teams have weaknesses, 
though Arizona obviously has the blossoming talent to overcome them. The 
Wildcats are best equipped to advance in the NCAAs, joining Nevada-Las Vegas 
and Loyola Marymount as the best teams on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that Arizona didn't have to beat great teams during its current 
11-game winning streak, with the exception of a 78-74 victory over Oklahoma, 
now No. 1. The Wildcats blew away Cal by 25 points at Berkeley and crushed 
passive Oregon State by 27 Saturday to tie the Beavers for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
While the Wildcats were demolishing their Pac-10 competition, they ventured out 
of conference play for three games: losses at Pittsburgh, UNLV and Duke. This 
doesn't bode well for the Pac-10 in the tourney, and it's apparent Arizona's 
best days are ahead, when redshirt Chris Mills joins the steadily improving 
team next season. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State and Cal are good, not great. UCLA doesn't deserve NCAA tourney 
consideration following its collapse. UC Santa Barbara and New Mexico State are 
more worthy. The Beavers will go as far as Gary Payton takes them. They 
over-achieved in the Pac-10, but are vulnerable to any tournament team with 
bulk up front and sharp-shooting guards. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Bears have made strides in becoming a road-tough team, leading the 
Pac-10 with a 7-2 road record in conference play, yet their inconsistency 
remains. How else can you explain a mere 5-4 conference record at home, 
including blowouts by Arizona, UCLA and Stanford? 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Cal may not make it to the NCAA tournament if it is eliminated 
quickly in the Pac-10 tournament. Ironically, Lou Campanelli was a proponent of 
the conference tournament. Pretenders love the format. It's a lot easier to win 
20 games when you play 35, as the Bears did in 1986-87. Contenders, like Olson, 
would just as soon sit on their reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Why the Big West and the West Coast Conference went to a postseason tourney is 
more understandable. They begged for recognition in the shadow of the Pac-10, 
so the national TV exposure of conference tourney title games proved beneficial 
for their images. 
</P>
<P>
But those conferences won't gain with such games this week. Loyola Marymount 
seemed a WCC tourney cinch until tragedy struck Sunday. It is extremely 
doubtful the conference will have more than one team in the NCAA event, and the 
23-5 Lions have been weakened mentally and physically by the loss of Hank 
Gathers. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV also has nothing to gain and everything to lose by having to prove itself 
all over in the Big West tourney this weekend. New Mexico State and UCSB proved 
the Rebels vincible with regular-season upsets at home, but aren't likely to 
down the best team in the West on a neutral court. Early losses by New Mexico 
State and Santa Barbara this week, however, could hinder their NCAA chances. 
</P>
<P>
It all depends on the draw, of course, but UNLV seems more capable of advancing 
in postseason play than do the inexperienced Wildcats. Since Loyola Marymount 
has decided to participate, the Lions' record-shattering offensive pace is 
disruptive to teams accustomed to playing conventionally. LMU also is blessed 
with talented shooters such as Bo Kimble and Jeff Fryer. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV also has firepower, the best power forward in the West (Larry Johnson) and 
perhaps the region's finest defender (Stacey Augmon). The Rebels also have 
Jerry Tarkanian, who annually overcomes distractions to finish strong. He 
regards the current Rebels potentially his best-balanced team. Who's to argue? 
All five starters are averaging in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions and the Rebels have veteran players on whom you can depend. Arizona 
isn't quite to that point yet, but it's a matter of time. Whether that time 
will come in the next few days remains to be seen. If not, the Pac-10 will be 
on the outside looking in again when the NCAA West Regionals are staged in 
Oakland, March 23-25.

NORTHRIDGE DISCOVERS AN OFFENSE IN 9-5 CONFERENCE WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Cal State Northridge baseball team experienced an awakening Saturday in a 
9-5 win over Cal State Los Angeles at Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (12-10 overall), which defeated the Golden Eagles for the second 
time in as many days, finished its first round of California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. play with a 7-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors will play at UCLA on Wednesday in the first of 11 consecutive 
nonconference games before resuming CCAA play April 5. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been slumping lately," said Northridge Coach Bill Kernen, whose 
Matadors had dropped four conference games in a row before sweeping the series 
with Cal State L. A. (9-14, 2-3 in conference play). 
</P>
<P>
"(Saturday's) game was the first time that we had an actual offense and just 
didn't wait for someone to hit a home run," Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
It also was the first time in six games since a 7-6 victory over Chapman on 
Feb. 27 that the Matadors had scored more than three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday marked the first collegiate start for freshman left-hander John 
Bushart (1-0). The former Thousand Oaks High standout came into the game with a 
14.52 earned-run average in 4 2/3 innings. But Bushart pitched seven strong 
innings against the Golden Eagles, allowing two earned runs on three hits. 
</P>
<P>
"He pitched a tremendous game," Kernen said. "He's been waiting his turn and 
finally got his chance." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge erupted for seven runs in the fifth inning to break a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Kyle Washington knocked in two runs on a bases-loaded single. Eric Johnson had 
an RBI double and Craig Clayton hit a run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge also got help from Golden Eagle reliever Todd Johnson, who threw 
back-to-back wild pitches with the bases loaded to bring home two more 
Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State L. A. scored two unearned runs in the second inning to take a 2-0 
lead before Northridge tied the score with a run in each of the third and 
fourth innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Eagles added a run in the sixth and another in the eighth to cut the 
Northridge lead to 9-4, but reliever Todd Denhart retired Abdom Pinon on a 
groundout to end the rally. Steve Soliz homered in the top of the ninth and Cal 
State L. A. had runners at first and second with one out. But Steve Velasquez 
flied out to center fielder Greg Shockey, who threw out David Adams trying to 
advance to end the game.

John Kunishima came to the NCAA Division II Swimming and Diving Championships 
an unknown, but he walked away from the pool at the State University of New 
York at Buffalo Saturday night as the meet's top male swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
Kunishima had a hand in 170 of the 392 points third-place Cal State Northridge 
scored in the meet. 
</P>
<P>
He won a pair of individual titles, placed second twice, and helped Matador 
relay teams take two seconds and a fifth. 
</P>
<P>
The Northridge sophomore bested Andrew Bures of champion Cal State Bakersfield 
to win the award in a vote of coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Bures, a Czechoslovakian-import who began attending classes at Bakersfield at 
the start of the semester, won four individual titles and set three Division II 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Accardy, Northridge's coach, said he was not surprised that Bures was 
overlooked in favor of Kunishima. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew John impressed a lot of people here this week," Accardy said. "Bures 
just showed up. What he did was expected." 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield won the men's portion of the meet for the fifth year in a row, 
finishing with 830 points. Oakland (Mich.) University was second with 686, 
followed by Northridge; Cal State Chico, 349.5; and Shippensburg (Pa.), 301. 
</P>
<P>
Kunishima said he was listening for Bures' name when the award was announced, 
only to hear his own. 
</P>
<P>
"When they said my name . . . . I still can't describe the feeling I have," a 
teary-eyed Kunishima said. "It feels good inside that the coaches thought I was 
swimmer of the meet." 
</P>
<P>
Kunishima started the day believing he needed a victory in the 100-yard 
freestyle to have an outside shot at the award. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning preliminaries he set a Division II record of 44.52 in the event, 
but it lasted less than eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kunishima bettered his time during the evening's finals, he finished 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton Woods of Oakland out-touched the smaller and shorter Kunishima to win in 
a record 44.16, nine one-hundredths of a second ahead of Kunishima. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN's Ted Hollahan, who held the Division II standard of 44.65 coming into the 
day, placed third. His 44.55 also was a personal-best. 
</P>
<P>
Kunishima had set a Division II record in winning the 200-yard individual 
medley earlier in the week and also won the 200-yard freestyle in near-record 
time. In addition, he placed second in the 100-yard backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's 100 final, he broke on top and was in front by a head after 25 
yards. Woods, three-time champion in the 50-yard freestyle, caught Kunishima on 
the first turn but fell back into second after 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"When we hit the 50 I thought, 'I've got this race won,' " Kunishima said. "I 
didn't think they could catch me." 
</P>
<P>
Kunishima and Woods appeared even with as little as 10 yards to go but Woods, 
who at a muscular 6-foot-5 is about nine inches taller than Kunishima, touched 
first. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Kunishima's second-place finish, the Matadors earned the 
runner-up place in the 200-yard backstroke and the 400-yard freestyle relay. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN's Sean Parker, a senior from Miami, turned in a 1:53.78 effort in the 200 
back. Brady Stauffer of Shippensburg, the defending champion and Division II 
record-holder, won in 1:52.79. 
</P>
<P>
In the 400 relay, strong opening legs by Kunishima (44.44) and Hollahan (44.34) 
helped Northridge edge Bakersfield for second. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland, behind a 43.76 anchor leg by Woods, won in 2:59.58. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Kelly of CSUN was third in the 200 breaststroke in 2:04.37.

MORNINGSIDE GIRLS HAVE CHANCE FOR REPEAT STATE TITLE; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASKETBALL: SATURDAY'S CHAMPIONSHIP GAME WILL BE THE THIRD FOR STAR CENTER 
LISA LESLIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Even second chances are often hard to get. But Morningside High School's Lisa 
Leslie, who has already played in two state championship games, will get her 
third chance Saturday, thanks to a 61-45 win over Los Angeles Washington at the 
Sports Arena last Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore in 1988, Leslie missed a potential game-winning shot in a loss 
to Oakland Fremont in the state Division I title game. 
</P>
<P>
That defeat, she said, was a turning point her career -- a career that has 
included recognition as California Player of the Year as a junior and national 
Player of the Year this year as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
"That summer, that game stayed with us," Leslie said after scoring 37 points 
Friday. "It made us hungry, and that definitely made me a better player. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't forget (the loss). It carried a long way." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie earned redemption by scoring 21 points to lead the Monarchs to a 60-50 
win over Fremont in last March's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Now she has a chance to lead Morningside to back-to-back state crowns. The 
disappointment of two years ago is just a distant memory. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the challenge was to exorcise demons; now the challenge is to 
establish the Monarchs' place in history as a great team. In that respect, the 
Monarchs' quest to repeat as champions is like that of the Los Angeles Lakers 
in 1988 or the San Francisco 49ers this past season. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie's foul trouble has been the biggest obstacle the Monarchs have had to 
overcome in the playoffs so far. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to repeat because everyone is out to beat you, including the 
referees," the 6-5 Leslie said with a laugh. "Maybe (the referees) don't like 
me because I'm taller than them." 
</P>
<P>
She added that the coming week of school and practice won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough mentally," said Leslie, who is averaging more than 25 points and 10 
rebounds per game. "It's tough knowing what's in store for you at the end of 
the week." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside Coach Frank Scott said that no matter what happens Saturday in the 
4:45 p.m. game at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena, Leslie has 
established herself as an important person in the sports world. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a spokesperson for high school basketball, for girls' basketball," said 
Scott, who has led the Monarchs to a 31-3 record. "And when she goes to 
college, whatever program she goes to, she'll be a spokesperson for women's 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
If that's true, Leslie said, she accepts that role. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has a purpose," she said. "Maybe that's one of the reasons I'm here 
on Earth: to be on the basketball court and to represent the game." 
</P>
<P>
Although Leslie has the mark of a once-in-a-lifetime player, Scott said 6-4 
sophomore Janet Davis will be a more-than-adequate replacement at center next 
season. Davis, a two-year starter at forward, has played well recently, scoring 
a total of 31 points in the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
"The only difference between these two is mental toughness," Scott said. "Janet 
isn't lacking any skills." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said she has a different approach heading into this season's trip to 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, it was a learning experience, and I was kind of nervous," she said. 
"This year, I'm just concentrating on being aggressive, rebounding and trying 
my best." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said she has enjoyed being Leslie's understudy but will be ready to move 
into the spotlight next season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll miss her," she said of Leslie. "She's tried to teach me everything she 
knows. She taught me to never put my head down. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be playing her position, which puts pressure on me. But I think I can 
handle it." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Leslie said she is ready to step up to new things next season. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like the end, but it's only the beginning," Leslie said. "It may be 
the end of my time at Morningside High School, but it's just the beginning of 
my career." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside, Cal-Hi Sports Weekly's top-ranked Division I team, is a strong 
favorite to win Saturday. And the team is brimming with confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"We like it up there," Scott said with a smile. "We try to go whenever we can. 
We're young, but we're an experienced team. We've been through the wringer." 
</P>
<P>
Two of the Monarchs' losses this season came in a tournament in Tennessee 
before the start of league play, and Scott said things might be different if 
his team played the same opponents now. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I'd never even seen or heard of Tennessee," he said. "But we learned a 
lot from that experience and are a better team now. And I'd like to get them in 
a neutral setting now." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Morningside won't get a chance to do that. But Scott and Leslie are 
satisfied with the opportunity presented to them in Oakland. "I'd like to win 
it for Lisa and Denesha Carnell, our two seniors," Scott said. "And I'd like to 
win it for myself. You never know when you'll get another chance."

CS NORTHRIDGE FALLS SHORT BY 4 POINTS IN FINAL EVENT;

WOMEN: OAKLAND (MICH.) WINS TITLE AFTER BEATING MATADORS IN 400 FREESTYLE 
RELAY.

<P>
Coach Pete Accardy did not have to say the Cal State Northridge women's swim 
team was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
His choice of wardrobe said it for him. 
</P>
<P>
Accardy wore jeans the first three days of the previous three NCAA Division II 
Swimming and Diving Championships, in which the Lady Matadors had won three 
consecutive titles. On the final day, he wore shorts. 
</P>
<P>
Asked last year to explain the switch, he replied: "Because shorts dry faster 
than jeans." 
</P>
<P>
It was clear that CSUN's coach was counting on a ceremonious victory dip in the 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the final day of this year's meet at State University of New York 
at Buffalo, Accardy showed up in jeans. It proved to be a bad omen. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland (Mich.) University defeated Northridge in the 400-yard freestyle relay, 
the meet's final event, to squeeze past the Lady Matadors, 423-419, and earn 
the women's title. North Dakota, the leader after three days of competition, 
fell to third with 405 points. 
</P>
<P>
In CSUN's final season of competition at the Division II level -- the school 
will compete in Division I beginning this fall -- Oakland, a team that had 
never won a team championship, played the role of spoiler. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to take anything away from Oakland," Accardy said. "Their girls 
swam great and they have a good program. But are they really national 
champions?" 
</P>
<P>
Yes, indeed, they are. But as Accardy spoke, his head shook an emphatic "No." 
</P>
<P>
In Accardy's opinion, one shared by his team and several opposing coaches, the 
Lady Matadors were robbed of the title by the meet's officials. 
</P>
<P>
That contention stems from Wednesday's disqualification of Toady Kimble in the 
50-yard freestyle and Friday's ousting of CSUN's 400-yard medley relay team. 
</P>
<P>
The disqualifications -- Kimble's for a false start and the relay team's for an 
illegal turn -- probably cost Northridge 44 points. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, who later won the 100-yard freestyle, was a heavy favorite in the 50. A 
victory would have been worth 20 points. In the relay, CSUN placed seventh, 
earning 24 points, before learning an infraction had been called. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's 200-yard medley relay team was disqualified Wednesday, a 34-point 
swing. But the 10-point difference in penalties would have put CSUN in front at 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
"Our girls have to feel like (the championship) was taken away from them," 
Accardy said. "It would have been one thing if they were outswum. But they 
weren't." 
</P>
<P>
Meet officials met Saturday morning to consider a Northridge protest of its 
relay disqualification. However, the decision was upheld. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's what Accardy was told by other coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the officials have said anything to me about it," Accardy said after 
the meet. "I heard through the grapevine that (the protest) didn't go through. 
It would be nice to know why." 
</P>
<P>
The call was made by lane judge Matt Dembrow, who said that Mara Morgan, on the 
backstroke leg, had broken the vertical plane of her shoulders before touching 
the wall on her turn. 
</P>
<P>
Accardy disputed that Morgan's turn was illegal, and he claimed that Dembrow's 
call had been influenced by another official. 
</P>
<P>
A raised hand is a judge's signal for disqualification. Witnesses said that 
Dembrow raised his hand halfway, then conferred with head referee John Pat 
Bourassa. 
</P>
<P>
After a short conversation, Dembrow fully extended his arm. 
</P>
<P>
Accardy's claim that Bourassa had influenced Dembrow's call was backed by 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee Coach Dave Enzler, who said he heard Bourassa tell the lane 
judge to place his hand in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"What bothers me," Enzler said, "is that I had just sat through a meeting in 
which they told everyone that disqualification calls would be done immediately 
and without discussion." 
</P>
<P>
Bourassa on Friday said the call was Dembrow's. Dembrow declined comment, 
referring all questions to Bourassa. 
</P>
<P>
Dembrow was conspicuous by his absence Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Even with its two infractions, Northridge would have defended its title with a 
stronger showing -- make that any showing -- by its diving team. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland picked up 39 points in the one- and three-meter diving competitions. 
CSUN has a diving coach -- Dennis Taylor -- but no divers. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge had a four-point lead over Oakland going into the 400-yard freestyle 
relay, the meet's final event. 
</P>
<P>
But Accardy knew his team's fate likely was already sealed. Oakland's 
qualifying time was more than two seconds faster than CSUN's. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Guilfoyle gave Oakland a one-second lead after the first 100 yards and 
Kerry Leavoy and Dana Kennedy extended the lead to 2.42 seconds -- about three 
body lengths -- with 100 yards to go. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, swimming the anchor leg for CSUN, trimmed one-third off Lyn Schermer's 
lead by covering the first 50 yards in 23.2. She couldn't continue that pace, 
however, and faltered markedly in the final 25 yards and was out-touched by 
Kirsten Silvester of Northern Michigan, which finished second. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland was in strong contention for the team title after Northridge fell short 
of its scoring expections in the 200-yard backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
Mara Morgan of CSUN finished third in the finals, scoring 16 points, but Carole 
Eisele, who Accardy hoped would challenge for the consolation championship, 
finished last in her race. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the finals of the 200-yard breaststroke, the meet's last individual 
race, the Lady Matadors needed an upset victory from Kathy Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz, the third-fastest qualifier, finished third in 2:22.79 behind Carolyn 
Bentley of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (2:20.64) and Colleen Criscillo of Army 
(2:21.45). 
</P>
<P>
Northridge started the day in third place, 30 points behind front-running North 
Dakota and five shy of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Strong finishes by Michelle Sulak and Lisa Dial in the 1,650-yard freestyle put 
CSUN within a point of North Dakota after the night's first event. 
</P>
<P>
Sulak lopped nine seconds off her personal best to finish third in a 
school-record 16:58.01. Dial turned in an effort of 17:07.70 to place sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge picked up 29 points in the event to take a 16-point lead over 
Oakland. North Dakota was shut out in the 1,650 but temporarily clung to a 
330-329 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland vaulted over both opponents with a 2-4-8-11 finish -- worth 49 points 
-- in the 100-yard freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble won the event for Northridge in 51.10, but the 20 points she earned for 
the victory were CSUN's only ones of the race. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, Kimble said later, took its toll on her leg strength for the 
relay. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to come back," she said of her relay effort, "but my legs were 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
However, her sense of humor wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
On the way back from accepting CSUN's third-place award for the relay, Kimble 
offered an alternative to CSUN's usual post-meet celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"I think maybe we should just throw the officials in the pool," she said.

EL CAMINO'S SPIRITS HIGH AFTER SEMIFINAL LOSS; 
</P>
<P>
JC BASKETBALL: PLAYOFF WINNING STREAK SALVAGED THE WARRIORS' SEASON. NOW 
THEY'RE LOOKING TO NEXT YEAR.

<P>
The phrase coming out of Ron McClurkin's mouth Friday night had a familiar ring 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
For the second year in a row, his El Camino basketball team lost in the state 
semifinals, and the coach said simply: "We'll be back. El Camino will be back 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
Last season the Warriors were eliminated by Chabot, which made its second 
consecutive appearance in the state finals Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, El Camino lost, 81-70, to a powerful Rancho Santiago club that has 
an impressive 31-3 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the two teams that beat Rancho Santiago this year (Santa Monica and 
Cypress), were upset by El Camino in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors defeated Santa Monica, 81-79, in the opening round. Then they 
defeated Cypress, a two-time winner over Rancho Santiago, in the third round, 
80-71. 
</P>
<P>
The Loss to Rancho Santiago was disappointing but not tragic for an El Camino 
team that failed to at least share the South Coast Conference title for the 
first time since joining the league five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors surprised many by finishing in a three-way tie for third in the 
five-member conference. They entered league play with a 15-5 mark and were 
favored to contest the title with Cerritos, the eventual champion. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the conference schedule proved a nightmare for El Camino, whose 
basketball teams had won three junior college state titles in the 1980s under 
former Coach Paul Landreaux. 
</P>
<P>
In the league opener Jan. 6, El Camino suffered a stunning loss to Mt. San 
Antonio College, the SCC's worst team at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors dropped out of the state's top 20 after losing to Mt. SAC a second 
time Jan. 27. They never crawled back into the state rankings. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times," McClurkin said, "when we just couldn't suck it up and do 
it. We ran into a rough spot." 
</P>
<P>
But El Camino got going again on the road to the state finals. The Warriors 
ripped four higher-ranked teams in the playoffs to turn around what had 
appeared to be a disappointing season and earn a spot in the Final Eight 
Tournament at UC Irvine's Bren Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it was going to be a tough game because we knew El Camino had a very 
tough road to get here," Rancho Santiago Coach Dana Pagett said after his 
team's victory. "And it turned out that we had a lot of cause for concern." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors, seeded 23rd in the playoffs by virtue of their conference finish, 
had defeated No. 10 Santa Monica, No. 7 L.A. City and No. 2 Cypress, all on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally came together as a team," reflected guard Frank Beatty after 
Friday's loss. "Everybody woke up for the playoffs, 'cause everybody was asleep 
during league." 
</P>
<P>
McClurkin, in his second year as interim head coach, said the best part of his 
two seasons at the helm was this year's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We had good togetherness," he said. "We played real well as a group. I mean 
just to be here (in the state Final Eight Tournament) is great." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors finished with a 24-11 record, including a 4-1 post-season mark 
against favored teams. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Larry Lockley led El Camino's balanced scoring attack throughout the 
season. The 6-foot-4 guard averaged 18.8 points in the playoffs. Sophomore 
forwards David Keeter and Steve Leary were also impressive during the 
post-season with 14.0 averages. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a bad season," McClurkin said after the loss to Rancho Santiago. "We 
got 24 wins. We wanted to get 20, and we ended up with 24. That's not bad."

MIGUEL ALEMAN HITS THE ROAD, TOUTING MEXICO;

ECONOMY: THE TELEVISION MAGNATE, ONE OF THE NATION'S TOP CAPITALISTS, IS 
LEADING A GOVERNMENT DRIVE TO LURE FOREIGN INVESTMENT. HIS NEXT STOP IS L.A.

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexico's government and business community were very much at odds when the 
country's economic crisis began in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
President Jose Lopez Portillo blamed bankers for the flood of capital that 
poured out of Mexico as oil prices plummeted. Calling them traitors, he took 
over the banks. 
</P>
<P>
That act was the culmination of a long series of government intrusions into the 
economy. Price controls, subsidies and the nationalization of businesses from 
airlines and steel mills to bottling companies all provoked business criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Now the government is trimming back its economic role, and the current 
president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, is asking the business community to help 
bring in the investments and the international customers to make a private 
enterprise economy work. 
</P>
<P>
The man pressed into service to lead that effort is Miguel Aleman, son of one 
of Mexico's best-known political figures and until last year the top operating 
officer of Televisa, Mexico's only commercial broadcast television network, in 
which he retains an important ownership share. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexico really believes in the new trade and investment policy," the 
dark-haired, blue-eyed ambassador without portfolio said in a recent interview. 
"I am telling people what we are trying to do in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
That role is crucial for the Salinas Administration, which is counting on 
foreign investment and access to international markets to bring this country 
out of the 8-year-old economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas could hardly have picked a better link to the business community. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ambassadorship is the 57-year-old Aleman's first government job, 
he understands politics well because of his family background. 
</P>
<P>
He also believes strongly in Salinas' free enterprise approach. "We had a 
make-believe economy for 20 years," he said. "We had a very paternalistic 
government. Everything was rights and no obligations." 
</P>
<P>
Aleman is eager to play a part in helping Salinas succeed. And he has the clout 
to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Aleman is chairman of Mexico's major aluminum manufacturing company and sits on 
the boards of mining companies, a brokerage, an insurance company and a lumber 
company. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he and one of his two partners in Televisa own a major publishing 
house, Novedades Editores. Novedades prints books; daily newspapers, including 
one in English; glossy magazines for the Mexican upper classes, and adult comic 
books that entertain workers during their long commutes on buses and the 
subway. 
</P>
<P>
He is on a nine-day trade mission to Chicago and Los Angeles, and the strength 
of his contacts is evident in the makeup of the delegation that he is leading: 
the senior executive of Alfa, Mexico's most important industrial conglomerate; 
the chairman of Mexico's largest stock brokerage, and one of the country's most 
important financiers. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, Aleman is among the richest men in Mexico, although he 
declines to place a dollar figure on his personal wealth. 
</P>
<P>
"I never cared very much for money unless you use it," he said. "I know how to 
produce it and enjoy it." He has homes in Mexico City, Acapulco, his home state 
of Veracruz and the art colony of San Miguel de Allende, as well as apartments 
in New York and Los Angeles. He patronizes the arts and sponsors rural and 
resort development, mainly through a foundation that his father set up. 
</P>
<P>
"Above all," said one Mexico watcher in Washington, "Miguel Aleman is a very 
important symbol." 
</P>
<P>
For three generations of Mexicans, the name Miguel Aleman has meant power, 
prestige and a preference for personal liberty over the country's traditional 
paternalism. 
</P>
<P>
The Alemans have embodied those characteristics so strongly that the word 
Alemanista has become a part of Mexico's political lexicon. To be an Alemanista 
is to be pro-business, pro-United States and a firm believer in limiting 
government's role to building roads, ports and schools -- the foundations that 
individuals can use to build a prosperous economy. 
</P>
<P>
Aleman's grandfather, a general and a classical liberal, died in 1929 in 
fighting associated with the Mexican revolution. His father became president of 
Mexico in 1946, then was dean of the right wing of the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, the party that has dominated Mexican politics for 
60 years. 
</P>
<P>
But the Miguel Aleman of this generation rejected arms and politics to become 
one member of the triumvirate that dominates Mexican television. 
</P>
<P>
With support from Televisa, Aleman launched a new television production company 
in 1962. By the end of the decade, broadcasters all over Central and South 
America were showing programs from his Teleprogramas Acapulco. Channel 2 in 
Lima, Peru, depended on Aleman's company for 90% of its programming. 
</P>
<P>
That success came at a crucial time for Aleman. 
</P>
<P>
Estranged from his powerful family because he had married a French actress, 
Christianne Magnani, Miss Universe of 1954, he was trying to build an 
independent business career. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very difficult period, because his mother did not want the marriage," 
his auburn-haired wife, whose eyes still fill with tears at the memory, 
recalled recently. Aleman said his mother was so opposed to the match that she 
tried to prevent it by arranging a marriage for him with the daughter of a 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
But after the birth of the first of their four children, he and his wife were 
reconciled with the rest of the family, and his wife and mother eventually 
became close friends. However, by that time Aleman had decided to become a 
businessman instead of entering politics. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband has worked hard to develop something on his own," Christianne 
Aleman said. "Many young men with famous fathers do not even try." 
</P>
<P>
There was a two-year escape from his father's fame while he was in high school. 
He attended Peacock Military Academy in San Antonio while his father was 
president. Then he returned to Mexico for prep school and subsequently to take 
a law degree at the National Autonomous University. 
</P>
<P>
An aviation law specialist, he later worked in Mexico as a lawyer for Lockheed 
Corp. What really attracted him, though, was space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Aleman can tick off, in order, the names of the Mercury astronauts and their 
early Soviet counterparts, including the dog, Laika. That's not surprising when 
you consider that he saw many of the early U.S. and Soviet launches. He first 
became interested in television because of the potential that it presented for 
satellite communication. 
</P>
<P>
The possibilities offered by satellites still excite him. "I love doing 
simultaneous television," he said. "The landing of a man on the moon . . . when 
a game is going on. That's TV." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, however, he saw other potential in television. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1970s, Aleman was heading an effort to use soap operas to achieve 
social goals. "Ven Conmigo" ("Come With Me") was designed to encourage adults 
without basic educational skills to return to school. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the success of the show, Aleman took on a more controversial 
topic: family planning. Authorities in Mexico's Catholic Church opposed the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, he went to the Vatican and received church approval. "Fortunately, 
the church has a very intelligent Pope," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1977, Televisa began broadcasting "Acompaname" ("Accompany Me"), a 
show that centered on family harmony, looking at family planning as a way to 
achieve it. 
</P>
<P>
During the show's planned six months on the air, about half a million people 
told counselors at family-planning clinics that they went to the clinics 
because of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Aleman also explored production technology. With 18,000 hours a year of 
production and with limited studio capacity, Televisa has to turn out shows 
quickly. By paying attention to set construction, he supported development of 
production techniques that allow the company to produce a one-hour soap opera 
in 1 1/2 hours, including editing. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Aleman acquired an 18% stake in Televisa. Although he had the 
smallest share of the three Televisa partners, he became the network's 
president in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"He promised changes, more political opening and more regional television," 
said Raul Trejo Delarbre, a Mexico City researcher who has written and edited 
two books on Televisa. 
</P>
<P>
Roderic A. Camp of Central University of Iowa, a researcher on 
business-government relations in Mexico, said Aleman wanted to broadcast 
"intellectual discussions comparable to public television in the United States. 
He wanted to open discussions now taking place at the elite level in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
That would have been a major change for Mexican television, which is frequently 
accused of emphasizing the views of the PRI and the government. 
</P>
<P>
"He could not do it," Trejo Delarbre said. "The company's structure is too 
closed to permit change." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Aleman disagreed. The political discussions that he promised 
air every week on Televisa's Channel 9, one of the network's four channels, he 
said in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
Aleman still maintains close ties to Televisa, although his travel schedule as 
ambassador leaves no time for more than a limited administrative role. 
</P>
<P>
He has offices at both the Tourism and State departments but prefers to work 
from his Televisa office when he is in Mexico City. He was there an average of 
four days a month last year. 
</P>
<P>
Here, Aleman keeps his mementos: photographs of him shaking hands with Fidel 
Castro, Henry Kissinger, George Bush, Edward M. Kennedy -- and many more with 
the titans of Mexican industry and politics. 
</P>
<P>
Just as prominent is a shot of the special ambassador in a Batman suit, holding 
grandson Emilio. 
</P>
<P>
Across the office, seated beneath a pencil drawing of his father and dressed in 
more ambassadorial navy blue pin stripes, Aleman spoke about Mexico's future. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexico is wed to the U.S. and Canada," he said. "We are geographically married 
for the rest of our lives. Mexico . . . (must) become part of a North American 
common market with the U.S. and Canada." 
</P>
<P>
The first step, he said, is maquiladoras -- the factories in Mexico near the 
U.S. border that assemble foreign-made parts into products for export, mainly 
to the U.S. market. Next, he predicted, Mexico must determine what it can do to 
complement U.S. and Canadian strengths, allowing all three countries to compete 
in a global market. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement that went into effect a 
little more than a year ago took 15 years of negotiations and phasing in, 
Aleman said, "This is going to take time, of course."

MANAGING RETIREMENT; 
</P>
<P>
CAREERS: AFTER 80-HOUR WORKWEEKS AND THE TRAPPINGS OF CORPORATE POWER, MANY 
EXECUTIVES FIND LIFE IN THE SLOW LANE JARRING. EXPERTS SAY THE SECRET IS

<P>
Cornell Maier admits that a few times after he retired as chairman of Kaiser 
Aluminum, he took the wrong elevator and headed for his old executive suite 
rather than the new office in the same Oakland complex where he now works on 
public education issues. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Akins allows that it was difficult for him to avoid second-guessing his sons 
when he began turning his successful Orange County home-building firm over to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Former aerospace executive Frank Lynch wanted to continue his nonprofit work, 
but found some boards were less interested in him than in "the guy from 
Northrop." 
</P>
<P>
Gracefully stepping off the corporate ladder can be difficult for those at the 
top. 
</P>
<P>
While high-level executives usually are more than prepared financially, they 
frequently neglect the emotional side, job counselors say. Even those who make 
a successful transition -- Maier, Akins and Lynch, among them -- have moments 
when they suspect that they might not be the retiring kind. 
</P>
<P>
Top executives often underestimate how much they will miss the power and the 
trappings of the job. The limo and the corporate jet disappear. Social lives 
can dry up; golf games get boring. 
</P>
<P>
"I know very few happy retired people," Akins said. "It's tough, first off, 
from an ego standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
Some work around the problem by never retiring. And those who do seem to 
universally hate the "R" word. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people we work with don't like that word -- retirement. They like 
to think they're in a career change," said Carl E. Samuels, who, along with his 
business partner and wife, Keiko Matsuura, specializes in counseling executives 
who are age 50 or older. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people don't prepare very well for retirement," said Richard Knowdell, a 
San Jose career counselor and executive director of the Career Planning &amp; 
Adult Development Network, a national network of career counselors. "It's like 
heading for a cliff with a blindfold on." 
</P>
<P>
Top-level retirement was the subject of a 1988 book titled "The Hero's 
Farewell: What Happens When CEOs Retire." In it, author Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, 
then an associate professor at Harvard Business School, contended that the way 
a top executive retires has a major effect on the organization that he leaves. 
</P>
<P>
(Even in 1990, top executives of a certain age are still, for the most part, 
men, particularly in corporations.) 
</P>
<P>
There are four basic departure styles, which Sonnenfeld, now a professor of 
organization and management at Emory University in Atlanta, labeled monarch, 
general, ambassador and governor. 
</P>
<P>
Monarchs die in office or are overthrown. Generals also frequently are forced 
out and then plot a triumphant return. Ambassadors leave but maintain ties with 
the company. Governors exit the job and seldom look back. 
</P>
<P>
"Some heroes, even in late career, often ride off into the sunset -- not to 
obscurity, but in search of new adventures," Sonnenfeld wrote. "But to others, 
retirement suggests an abdication of heroic status and an aborted heroic 
mission." 
</P>
<P>
The higher up you go in a hierarchy, the more difficult retirement becomes, 
said Elwood Chapman, a former university professor who has written several 
books about retirement planning and other aspects of working life. 
</P>
<P>
"You get that ego fulfillment (from the job), and you can't get that at the 
country club or on the golf course," Chapman said. "It can be as difficult as a 
mid-life crisis -- maybe more so." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps one of the most famous and extreme examples of a bad retirement is that 
of George Eastman, who continued to haunt the corporate offices for years after 
his 1925 departure from the presidency of Eastman Kodak. In 1932, Eastman 
committed suicide, leaving a note that read: "To my friends -- My work is done, 
why wait?" 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem, Matsuura said, is that people are now living longer and 
retiring younger. They have a lot of life left to live after retirement and no 
idea how to do it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people lose a sense of purpose. They are driven by sales quotas, and 
that's gone. They lose friends or acquaintances. It's easy to get into a 
depression." Matsuura said. 
</P>
<P>
One executive of a medium-sized Orange County company who was also big on the 
social scene discovered that when he no longer headed that firm "he lost a lot 
of friends," Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people find that, 'Gee, a lot of these people I've been with are only 
acquaintances,' " he said. "The really sad part about a lot of these CEOs is 
they have no friends -- people they can talk to about what they're really 
frightened about." 
</P>
<P>
Lynch, Maier and Akins did not consult specialists as they neared retirement, 
but they approached the event much as the experts recommend. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman, for example, advises that all workers plan for retirement at least 
five years in advance, which often makes their final years with the corporation 
more productive. Chapman also suggests that executives consider leaving in 
degrees, perhaps by working part time for a while or maintaining ties with the 
corporation through consulting. 
</P>
<P>
Retirees must plan how to fill their hours or they risk frittering the time 
away and becoming dissatisfied with that life, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize just how much time they have when they are retired," 
Chapman said. "You sleep eight hours and the business of living takes maybe 
four and there are 12 hours left. They begin to trivialize it. They do things 
that don't have any significance." 
</P>
<P>
Lynch, former Northrop president who retired from the post of vice chairman a 
little more than a year ago, remained as a director of the aerospace company 
for another nine months to ease the transition. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch now spends his time as a director of several nonprofit corporations, 
including the Foundation for the Joffrey Ballet and Ballet Pacifica, a 
Laguna-based ballet company of which his daughter, Molly, is artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gone from the B-2 to the tutu," Lynch quipped. Lynch, 68, also works with 
the Los Angeles Music Center and is chairman of the investment committee for 
California State University at Los Angeles Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"I find that very satisfying," he said of his nonprofit work. 
</P>
<P>
Problems moving out of the executive suite "have to do with how much you've 
become identified with your work and your company," Lynch said. For him, "this 
is just another step that must come along." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Maier's retirement coincided with a change of company ownership, he 
has continued as an occasional consultant for Kaiser Aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
Maier said he decided in 1980 that he would retire by age 62 from the only 
employer he had ever known and would then devote his life to improving the 
quality of public education. He ultimately delayed his departure by a year when 
the company became embroiled in a takeover battle, finally retiring on Jan. 1, 
1988. Maier reportedly was hard at work the next day in his new office at his 
customary starting time: 5:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Maier grew up in a poor home without a father, and he said his mother always 
worked hard and stressed the value of education. 
</P>
<P>
"K-through-12 reform is the No. 1 interest in my life," said the 65-year-old 
Maier, a lifelong bachelor who worked for Kaiser Aluminum for 38 years. 
"Schools in the whole country are in disarray, and California's are some of the 
worst." 
</P>
<P>
Maier has spent a lot of time speaking to groups about SB 1274, a bill to 
reform the educational system. 
</P>
<P>
Maier is also involved in California Leadership, a nonpartisan group devoted to 
"getting more women and minorities in the decision-making process in 
California." As its first project, the group is tackling the problem of 
training the state's multicultural work force for the 21st Century, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although his current work "certainly is different . . . I think I was so well 
prepared for it that it wasn't difficult" to make the transition, Maier said. 
</P>
<P>
For Akins, the change was gradual. He took his time turning over his Orange 
County home-building firm to his sons, Bruce and Carl. 
</P>
<P>
Over a period of years, Akins reduced his involvement in the firm, coming to 
the office fewer days a week as his sons redesigned the company, now called 
Akins Development, and moved the headquarters to Newport Beach from Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
"I started going in less and less and less," Akins said. Then one day, Akins 
realized that his sons were running the company. 
</P>
<P>
"About 1983, I stopped going in altogether. It was an easy out," he said. "I 
would hate to work 30 years for a company and walk out one day with my last 
check. That would be a blow."

<P>
Akins said bowing out of the company that he founded with his wife, Priscilla, 
in 1948, wasn't always easy. 
</P>
<P>
"Very few people I know can back out and let someone else do it," Akins, 64, 
said. "But when you have strong sons, you don't want to emasculate them." 
</P>
<P>
When he left the company, Akins turned to his many other interests, including 
tending a boat and a ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"Carl likes to say that I'm in the maintenance business. I maintain my home, my 
car, my boat and my ranch," Akins said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
But Akins hasn't given up home building entirely. He now constructs miniature 
versions -- primarily as gifts, but sometimes for profit -- and Priscilla 
decorates the insides. 
</P>
<P>
"We've built a few of what we call custom homes and we've built a few tract 
homes from kits," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants Samuels and Matsuura said they find that top executives who have 
trouble with retirement frequently have lost touch with their wives and 
families, and have forgotten how to have fun in their push for success. 
</P>
<P>
One businessman who came to them had worked 80-hour weeks for 30 years before 
he leaped into retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone around him was really concerned about him because he knew nothing but 
work," Matsuura said. "He didn't have a hobby. He was a multimillionaire, but 
he didn't enjoy spending money." 
</P>
<P>
But the story had a happy ending, she said. After much self-examination, the 
executive adopted a more family-oriented life style and now spends about 30 
hours a week doing charity work. 
</P>
<P>
At their Seal Beach company, Business Life Transitions, where they work with 
both corporate officials and entrepreneurs, the consultants often organize 
groups of executives who can help each other through retirement. One group 
activity is a wilderness trek that is part of a larger self-analysis program. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to do a lot of unlearning of things that made them successful in 
corporations," Matsuura said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Samuels: "People have trouble letting go of the bar of the trapeze to 
even find out what's on the other side." 
</P>
<P>
Akins, Maier and Lynch agreed that developing interests outside the job is key 
to retiring well. 
</P>
<P>
"Get involved in community service," Maier said. "There's a lot of work to be 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Akins said he recently saw a friend who was nearing retirement from his chief 
executive's job. "He was very scared," Akins said. "A lot of people can't not 
work." 
</P>
<P>
The few happy retirees he knows, Akins said, "usually are doing something they 
would never have thought of." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, retirement "hasn't been all that bad," Lynch said. "A whole part of 
my life was laid to being the president of Northrop, and I don't miss that. 
It's a lot easier being a retired aerospace worker."

WHAT'S AHEAD FOR WALL STREET?; 
</P>
<P>
THE CASE FOR STOCKS: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reaching record highs in early January, the stock market has taken a 
tortuous turn for the worse, dragging investor sentiment down with it. Experts 
are divided on the market's future course. Some believe that stock prices have 
hit bottom and now is the time to buy; others believe that this is just the 
start of a long slide. Here are the arguments on each side. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that everybody already knows the bad news. And the bad news 
isn't as bad as it seems. 
</P>
<P>
A number of factors, including rising interest rates and inflation, have 
conspired to devastate stock prices. But the market, at least in theory, 
anticipates events at least six months in the future. By then, many economists 
believe, the bad news about inflation and interest rates will have subsided. 
</P>
<P>
With that scenario in mind, stocks look cheap. 
</P>
<P>
Since its record high on Jan. 2, the Dow Jones industrial index has fallen by 
more than 100 points. Stock prices are selling at modest prices in relation to 
their projected earnings -- less than 12 times per-share earnings, compared to 
more than 20 times earnings when the market was overheated. And dividend yields 
are now above 4% -- a healthy premium over the anemic 2.5% yields when the 
market was due for a major correction. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've hit the low end of the range, and both the stock and bond 
markets are very attractive right now," said Michael Metz, market strategist 
for Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Although interest rates have not fallen as far or as fast as investors had 
previously hoped, upward pressures on rates are diminishing, so further hikes 
seem unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some analysts contend that investors have overreacted to inflation, 
which has jumped in recent months primarily because of one-time events such as 
Hurricane Hugo, the Florida freeze and the Bay Area Quake. But the impact of 
those events is already diminishing, and inflation will probably drop to very 
low levels by mid-year. Interest rates are bound to follow, moving at least 
slightly lower by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
"In a low-inflation and low-interest-rate market, I think you will see the 
market driven up," Metz said. He expects the Dow Jones industrial index to hit 
new highs this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Other "bulls" -- people who believe the stock market is headed up -- think that 
the negatives have already been factored into stock prices but some of the 
ensuing positives have not. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't see a lot of room for surprises on the downside," said Eugene E. 
Peroni Jr., director of technical research for Janney Montgomery Scott in 
Philadelphia. "Many stocks are exhibiting bottoming signals, and I don't think 
the market has made its high for the year," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Peroni expects the Dow to approach the 2,900 level before year-end, and he 
believes that it could move past 3,000 in the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
Geraldine Weiss, editor of Investment Quality Trends in La Jolla, agrees: "On a 
technical basis, I see the market going higher. And on a fundamental basis, I 
see the reasons why investors would be attracted to buying stocks." If the 
market can surpass its all-time high of 2,810, Weiss believes that it will soar 
into the 3,000s. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the optimism has its roots in history. The stock market, over long 
periods of time, has outperformed most other investments. Over a 10-year period 
ended in 1989, for example, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index has 
appreciated by an average annual rate of 18.2%, while the yield on corporate 
bonds was 13.9% and real estate was up only 10.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, historical market statistics indicate that stocks are not 
overvalued. Typically, market analysts consider stocks overvalued when dividend 
yields fall below 3% and when stock prices rise above 20 times projected 
earnings per share. Neither is the case now, which makes any new price declines 
look like buying opportunities to these optimists. 
</P>
<P>
Market sentiment is also extremely negative, said Peter Canelo, investment 
strategist for Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Although sentiment has been climbing 
during the past week, still nearly half of the market experts surveyed by the 
Bullish Consensus in Pasadena are negative about the stock market's future. 
</P>
<P>
In the perverse world of market timing, such bad news is good news. Why? The 
theory is that if nearly everyone is pessimistic, the bulk of the market will 
have sold out by now. Smart investors would want to jump in while most are 
still pessimistic, because once the vast majority becomes optimistic, its 
usually too late to find any bargains. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, others believe that while the market may not stage an overall rally, 
certain company stocks are set for hikes simply because those individual firms 
are in good shape and their shares are selling at bargain prices. 
</P>
<P>
Shares in companies such as Hilton -- which were pounded in the past few days 
after the company announced that it was no longer for sale -- are selling near 
their annual low and for less than half the 52-week high, for example. That may 
be an overreaction because the asset value of its hotel group is still believed 
to be well above the company's recent market price of about $50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also believe that some well-positioned financial services companies 
and manufacturing firms are due for rallies. Blue chip stocks that were hard 
hit in recent market tumbles may also be positioned for gains. 
</P>
<P>
"There are good values out there, but at this stage, investors should be very 
selective," Weiss said. "I would think that these undervalued blue chips will 
lead the market."

JAMES FLANIGAN: MEXICO'S TELEPHONES MEAN U.S. DOLLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The headlines about free markets and economic change may come these days from 
Berlin and Moscow, but the real business opportunities are opening up in 
Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, Guadalajara, and elsewhere in Mexico where contracts were awarded 
last week for cellular telephone service. BellSouth, the Atlanta-based regional 
phone company, won the right to serve Guadalajara, in western Mexico, and other 
U.S. companies -- Motorola and McCaw Cellular, among them -- will provide 
service for other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Their entry into the Mexican market is a small part of a plan to build up 
telephone service in the country that has the world's 14th-largest economy -- 
as measured by its $180-billion annual output of goods and services -- but a 
telephone system that ranks 60th in the world. 
</P>
<P>
To correct that situation, the Mexican government will soon announce the sale 
to private investors of all or part of its 56% ownership of Telefonos de 
Mexico, the national phone company. After the privatization sale, TelMex will 
embark on a massive program to double the number of phone lines in Mexico in 
the next five years, and then double them again by the year 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
That's important to Americans in a couple of ways. First, U.S. investors own 
about 11% of TelMex's 4 billion shares outstanding, which trade over the 
counter in American Depositary Receipts, meaning that they can be purchased in 
dollars. Those shareholders were excited last week as Merrill Lynch sent its 
clients a buy recommendation on the stock, saying the privatization would take 
place in the next 12 months and lead to higher earnings for TelMex because the 
government was allowing it to retain tax money to finance expansion. TelMex 
stock rose about 3 cents a share to roughly $1.18. Two years ago, after the 
worldwide stock market crash, it sold for 8 cents. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. interests go far beyond stock action. U.S. business benefits on every 
level if Mexico builds up its telephone system. To begin with, as phone traffic 
grows, so do revenues of U.S. long distance companies because more than half of 
TelMex's phone calls are between the United States and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion may involve expenditures of $14 billion during the 1990s, with 
substantial business for U.S. suppliers such as American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph -- although the inside track on equipment sales belongs to Sweden's 
L. M. Ericsson and France's CIT Alcatel, which have manufactured in Mexico for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
More original are proposals that U.S. regional phone companies, such as 
BellSouth and US West, participate directly in TelMex's buildup by making an 
equity investment and sharing their knowledge of how to create and expand a 
modern phone network. The United States, with the world's highest-density 
networks -- 70 phone lines per 100 people -- has a lot to teach, and Mexico, 
with five lines per 100, has a lot to learn. If the plan is successful, Mexico 
will have 20 lines per 100 people by the year 2,000 -- comparable to European 
countries today -- and will be able to enter the 21st Century an industrially 
developed country. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, development is easier said than done and, for many people, easier 
said than understood. 
</P>
<P>
Why, for example, is Mexico -- like numerous other countries East and West -- 
privatizing its phone system? Because the Mexican government has better things 
to do with its money. If it holds 56% ownership and TelMex needs capital, the 
government must divert scarce tax revenue or see the phone service wither -- as 
it has. 
</P>
<P>
It's much wiser to let private investors finance the expansion. So President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, 41, a Harvard Ph.D. in political economics, plans to 
sell TelMex stock, just as his government is selling two steel mills to private 
investors. The TelMex sale could bring Salinas' government $3 billion, which it 
then could spend on water purification, roads and schools to further aid 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Other benefits would follow. The rapid growth of TelMex's modern phone system 
could propel Mexico's economy all by itself. A report by Douglas A. Campbell 
Co., a Los Angeles brokerage that has followed TelMex for many years, projects 
company revenues growing from $2 billion to $4 billion by 1991. Such growth 
would have a ripple effect in jobs for Mexico's 85 million people, in business 
for U.S. companies and in gains for U.S. investors. So there's a lot riding on 
TelMex's success. 
</P>
<P>
What could threaten such a grand plan? A failure of the privatized economy to 
create jobs fast enough for the people inevitably laid off by modernizing state 
companies like TelMex. That could lead to a reaction against Salinas and his 
government, which is led by U.S.-educated economists like himself, and their 
defeat in legislative elections coming up in 1991. And such a defeat could turn 
back the clock again in a country that has seen too many grim yesterdays and 
too few bright tomorrows. 
</P>
<P>
Americans are anxious that economic change continue in Eastern Europe and the 
Soviet Union. They should not overlook an even more important country closer to 
home.

CANDIDATES QUICKLY TARGET BROWN'S SEAT; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: WOULD-BE SUCCESSORS OF THE 58TH DISTRICT ASSEMBLYMAN POP UP WITHIN 
THREE DAYS OF ANNOUNCEMENT HE WON'T RUN AGAIN.

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eager to take advantage of Dennis Brown's decision not to run for reelection to 
his 58th District Assembly seat, would-be successors are sprouting like desert 
wildflowers after a spring shower. 
</P>
<P>
Within three days of Brown's announcement last week that he will not seek 
another term, three Republicans announced they would run in the June primary, 
while two Democrats have also indicated they will compete for the seat. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach City Councilwoman Jan Hall, Long Beach physician Seymour Alban and 
Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays said they will pursue the Republican 
nomination. On the Democratic side, Joel R. Bishop, a Long Beach computer 
systems analyst, and Luanne Pryor, a public relations firm owner who ran 
unsuccessfully for mayor of Long Beach, are expected to mount campaigns for the 
seat, which represents Signal Hill and parts of Long Beach as well as 
communities in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
A three-term City Council member who also ran for mayor two years ago, Hall 
announced a month ago that she would not seek another term on the council but 
remained interested in other political positions. 
</P>
<P>
"An opportunity has presented itself to continue to serve the public at the 
state level, an opportunity to continue the work I have pursued for the past 20 
years," said Hall, who heads the California Commission on the Status of Women 
and recently resigned her position on the board of directors of the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District. 
</P>
<P>
The primary will be the political debut for Alban, a 65-year-old orthopedic 
surgeon and past president of the Long Beach Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in California health and I think I can make a major 
contribution," said Alban, adding that he had previously considered the seat 
but decided against challenging Brown, a staunch conservative whose voting 
record earned him the nickname "Dr. No." 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are times when it should be 'yes,' " said Alban, who noted he 
was pro-choice on abortion issues. 
</P>
<P>
Mays, an ambitious 36-year-old, moved swiftly to capitalize on his sudden 
visibility from last month's oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a crazy couple of days, but late Tuesday I decided the time is right 
to take a chance and go for it," Mays said Wednesday. "I was setting my sights 
on 1992, but Dennis' announcement Monday accelerated my plans. Nobody thought 
Dennis would bow out." 
</P>
<P>
All but Brown's closest friends and political allies were surprised by the 
veteran lawmaker's decision not to seek reelection after representing the 
heavily GOP district since 1978. But Brown, 40, said he wants to pursue other 
interests, perhaps returning to the brokerage business. 
</P>
<P>
Mays is the only Orange County-based candidate in the race so far. The mayor, a 
lean former surfer with a boyish face, appeared almost daily on national 
network TV as he answered questions about the oil spill and its effect on the 
beaches of "Surf City." About 394,000 gallons of oil spilled from the tanker 
American Trader on Feb. 7 when it struck one of its own anchors about 1.3 miles 
southwest of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Mays likes to describe himself as a conservative with a "strong bent for the 
environment." He contends that "politics and bickering" have stymied attempts 
by Sacramento lawmakers to make serious headway in solving important 
environmental concerns, a theme he says will be the centerpiece of his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, too, mentioned environmental issues, saying she has "fought to clean up 
the air we breathe and move toward alternative fuel sources" while on the rapid 
transit board. 
</P>
<P>
Hall resigned from the transit board in late January to work for a private 
consulting firm, creating controversy when she announced that she would oversee 
the company's lobbying contract with the transit district. Her former board 
colleagues subsequently cancelled the contract, anxious to quiet criticism that 
the arrangement smacked of revolving-door favoritism. 
</P>

<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
The deadline for filing election papers, which would have been Friday, has been 
extended until Wednesday because of Assemblyman Dennis Brown's announcement not 
to stand for reelection in the 58th District.

PRESS-TELEGRAM STAFFERS ASK READERS TO DROP SUBSCRIPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROXANA KOPETMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Press-Telegram reporters and other workers in Long Beach have been knocking on 
doors, standing outside supermarkets and even cruising a few bars to ask 
readers to cancel their subscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
Members of two unions at the daily newspaper have called for a subscription 
boycott in an effort to gain more leverage in protracted contract negotiations 
with the company. Union members said they have collected about 1,500 cards from 
readers willing to discontinue their subscriptions. The cancellations would 
take effect if the Los Angeles Newspaper Guild decides to turn in the cards. 
</P>
<P>
The company's contract with the guild, which represents 210 editorial staffers, 
custodians, clerks, truck drivers and circulation workers, expired more than a 
year ago. About 35 production workers represented by the Communications Workers 
of America have been without a contract more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a paradoxical situation," Press-Telegram reporter Dorothy Korber said of 
the subscription boycott. "You work all day to put out the paper, and at night, 
you go out and ask people to cancel their subscriptions." 
</P>
<P>
"It's really weird encouraging people to cancel their subscriptions. But it's 
better than being on strike and losing my home," said Korber, who, with most of 
the reporters, has collected subscription cancellations from shoppers at 
supermarkets and other sites. 
</P>
<P>
The paper's executives said that such a drive in the long run could only hurt 
the employees. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that it's counterproductive for newspaper employees to hurt 
their employers," said Bob Rowell, the Press-Telegram's vice president of 
operations. "It's probably a legitimate action from a legal standpoint. (But) 
it doesn't mean that it's not boneheaded from the other standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
Publisher Peter B. Ridder called the union's drive a tactic born of 
"desperation." Union leaders said they want to avoid a strike because they fear 
that they would lose their jobs. However, Ridder said: "We have no intention of 
locking them out. We have a lot of good employees here." 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, management made a new offer, which the guild membership is 
scheduled to vote on today. Executives said the new offer is not the result of 
the boycott effort. 
</P>
<P>
Guild president Todd Cunningham said he believes the members may reject the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining roadblock is the company's push to forbid employees from carrying 
on job actions such as a subscription boycott. Any action that could hurt the 
company economically would be forbidden under the proposed contract. 
</P>
<P>
"That absolutely binds the hands of the union," Cunningham said. But Ridder 
described the disputed clause as "a very reasonable request. In the Greater Los 
Angeles area, no other newspaper faces the threat of economic actions while 
employees are working." 
</P>
<P>
Both sides seemed to hit a wall last month when the company presented its "last 
and final" offer, which the union rejected on Feb. 6 by a 123-16 vote. But they 
met three times in the last two weeks. The latest offer would provide a 3% pay 
raise last year, 3.6% this year, and 4% each of the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Union members have in the past year resorted to other demonstrations. In one 
action, about 150 employees and supporters picketed Feb. 28 outside the 
newspaper's downtown office, one year after the guild contract expired. 
</P>
<P>
Subscription boycotts have been used at times in other newspaper 
union-management disputes, according to Linda Foley of the Newspaper Guild in 
Washington. The success rate for such boycotts varies, said Foley, executive 
secretary for the guild's contracts committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, just the threat of a campaign itself" is enough to push a company 
to settle a contract, Foley said. But at newspapers such as the Sacramento Bee, 
boycott subscriptions have failed to elicit enough cancellation pledges to make 
an impact, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Press-Telegram's circulation is nearly 136,000 daily and 157,000 on 
Sundays, according to company officials. 
</P>
<P>
The union is banking on the support of other large unions in the area. The 
Press-Telegram employees have won the endorsement of the Los Angeles County 
Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, the Teachers Assn. of Long Beach, the Long Beach 
Police Officers Assn., the United Auto Workers and the Teamsters Union. 
</P>
<P>
The union's efforts have generated criticism from a deputy city attorney who 
recently questioned the newspaper's credibility in covering protracted contract 
negotiations between the police union and city management. The guild has 
publicly backed the Police Officers Assn., and the police union has 
reciprocated. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said reporters avoided soliciting the support of sources and 
officials on their beats, such as police. Cunningham, who asked the Police 
Officers Assn. for support, is the newspaper's entertainment editor. "We don't 
even want to give an appearance of a conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
Rich Archbold, the paper's managing editor, said the paper's coverage of the 
ongoing dispute between police and the city has not been compromised. He called 
such allegations "nonsense." Ridder agreed, saying that "the newspaper 
employees continue to separate issues of news coverage and bargaining."

NAVY: A LONG BEACH DELEGATION DIVES INTO CAPITOL HILL FRAY BUT LEAVES WITH NO 
COMMITMENT TO SAVE SHIPYARD.

<P>
A delegation of Long Beach's highest-ranking officials made "a big splash" at a 
three-day lobbying mission last week to stop the closure of the Long Beach 
Naval Shipyard. But they came away with no firm commitments from the Pentagon 
or the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a big splash hit on Broadway," Long Beach lobbyist Del Smith 
proclaimed at the close of the city's first trek to Washington to save the 
shipyard, one of 100 military installations marked for closure by the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
It was clear, however, that it would take more than one East Coast journey to 
salvage the 43-year-old yard and the 4,100 civilian jobs that hang in the 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
Delegations like Long Beach's have become common sights on Capitol Hill since 
the military cuts were announced in January, as local representatives try to 
rally support to save military jobs and revenues in their districts. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, such missions involve a good deal of preaching to the converted -- 
those local representatives and senators who would be hurt politically by the 
yard's closure. But they tend to make little headway with other officials with 
their own interests and installations to defend. 
</P>
<P>
The group -- led by Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell and U.S. Reps. Glenn M. 
Anderson (D-San Pedro), Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) and Mervyn M. Dymally 
(D-Compton) -- pressed their case with Secretary of the Navy H. Lawrence 
Garrett III and White House officials. They also met with Democratic and 
Republican congressional leaders, including Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the 
House Armed Services Committee, and Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), a member 
of the Military Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"All of them agreed with our statement that the Long Beach Naval Shipyard 
should not be closed -- except for Garrett. He said he's going to evaluate it 
very carefully," Kell said at a news conference outside the House chamber. Kell 
was accompanied by Long Beach Vice Mayor Wallace Edgerton, City Manager James 
C. Hankla and Councilmen Tom Clark, Ray Grabinski, Evan Anderson Braude and 
Jeff Kellogg. 
</P>
<P>
Although no promises were made, city leaders emphasized that the Defense 
Department has not closed the casket on the shipyard yet; a final decision is 
months away. 
</P>
<P>
A bill introduced by Aspin would require that a bipartisan committee review 
every proposed military closure, a process that could take up to two years. 
Opposition to the bill is already mounting, however, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach legislators took to Washington the results of a hastily conducted 
study showing that it would cost the Pentagon $1.7 billion to shut down the 
yard and make it useful for some other purpose, far exceeding the $8 million a 
year the Defense Department hopes to save by closing it. 
</P>
<P>
"The Navy hasn't really put pen to paper. They couldn't believe it," Smith said 
of the report commissioned by the Long Beach City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The delegation seemed encouraged by Vice President Dan Quayle's endorsement of 
the shipyard during a recent visit to Long Beach and by similar backing from a 
number of congressional leaders in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Vice President Quayle has given me his word that he will work with me to 
assure that there is an honest evaluation, that shipyard will stay in service," 
Rohrabacher said. "And that's what's best for Long Beach, but it's also what's 
best for the United States of America and the United States Navy." 
</P>
<P>
One of the areas that could be hardest hit economically is Dymally's district 
in Compton, where about one-fourth of the shipyard's employees live. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the many people we met with that the Long Beach shipyard is not a 
facility that taxes the Pentagon, but if it is closed it would punish my 
people," said Dymally, who noted the high level of minorities among his 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
The delegation contends that the Long Beach yard is the only one of eight Navy 
ship-repair facilities to operate in the black last year. According to new 
figures released last week by Anderson's office, the yard saved the Navy $36 
million by finishing work under estimated costs -- about $15 million more than 
was previously reported by the government. 
</P>
<P>
City officials argue that closing one of the Navy's most efficient shipyards 
would actually increase the deficit because repair work would have to be doled 
out to yards that regularly overrun their cost estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would you close down the one that made all the money and keep open the 
ones that lost the money?" said Anderson, calling the Navy's logic "faulty." 
</P>
<P>
"I have to conclude that the Department of Defense is playing politics with 
Long Beach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 130 ships -- nearly one-third of the Navy's fleet -- are home-ported 
in Southern California. Although the Navy says some vessels might be 
redeployed, Long Beach is the nearest repair facility for most California-based 
ships. 
</P>
<P>
"It's right there. It's handy," argued Anderson, saying that the next-nearest 
repair yard is at Puget Sound in Washington state -- 1,200 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
The shipyards in Long Beach and Philadelphia -- the only other one marked for 
closure -- are incapable of repairing nuclear-powered ships, including some of 
the Navy's most modern vessels. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Pentagon official who declined to be identified said that was "one of 
the factors" that put the Long Beach yard on what has come to be known as the 
Pentagon's "hit list." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers John M. Broder in Washington and Faye Fiore in Long Beach 
contributed to this story.

5 VOCATIONAL INSTRUCTORS LOSE JOBS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: A REORGANIZATION OF AN OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM IN NORWALK 
AROUSES CONTROVERSY.

<P>
Five teachers in a vocational training program for high school students have 
lost their jobs under a controversial reorganization plan that officials say 
was necessary to provide the most qualified instructors and prevent a possible 
state penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization at the Southeast Regional Occupational Program involved 
classes that offer training in office skills. The program serves students in 
the Norwalk-La Mirada and ABC school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Classes offering basic clerical training had virtually no students, while some 
of the computer-training classes were full and had waiting lists, Supt. Bill 
Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were paying people for 35 hours a week to run classes that had no 
students," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 teachers were laid off Feb. 5, and then were told they would be 
considered for rehiring if they took a skills examination, Allen said. The 
examination emphasized computer knowledge and skills. Eight of the teachers 
passed the examination and were rehired. One teacher failed the test and the 
other four decided not to take it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to present the best program with the best qualified teachers," 
Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
The beginning office classes were running into problems because of poor 
attendance. Since September, a total of 175 students had dropped out of the 
classes offering basic clerical training, Allen said. The 32 classes offering 
computer training had an average of 25 students, who were learning how to use 
word-processing equipment and other skills needed to be hired in offices with 
computers, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers with fewer skills had fewer students, while teachers with computer 
training had more students, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also wanted to make sure that the program passes an audit scheduled 
early in 1991 by the state Department of Education, Allen said. The program was 
ordered to repay $158,000 to the state in 1988 and $39,000 in 1978 after 
apparently reporting inflated student attendance figures. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization plan has drawn some criticism. Norwalk-La Mirada school 
board member Armando Moreno said he was concerned about why the teachers were 
laid off and then were asked to reapply. "This doesn't make sense," Moreno 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreno said he has asked the Norwalk-La Mirada board members to consider 
holding a joint meeting with the ABC school board members to discuss the issue. 
Norwalk-La Mirada board members are expected to discuss the reorganization at 
the next regular meeting March 19. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said officials believed the procedure was the most objective, and that it 
had been approved by the program's attorneys. "It is an emotional rough thing 
to go through," he added. "I don't enjoy putting people through it." 
</P>
<P>
Juanita Wagner, one of the teachers who refused to take the test, said the exam 
was unfair. Wagner, who has been a teacher with the program for 3 1/2 years, 
said she and two others had purchased home computers to try to upgrade their 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
She said she decided not to take the examination after discovering that some of 
the questions dealt with topics beyond her skills. 
</P>
<P>
The test was given March 1 to 34 applicants, including the eight teachers who 
were rehired. Another two or three applicants who passed the test may be hired 
part time, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
The beginning office class is one of about 40 vocational education classes 
offered in the program, which also arranges some on-the-job training for the 
students. Some jobs pay, while others do not. There are about 4,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
Classes include welding, accounting, general office skills, auto mechanics, 
auto repair, word processing and cosmetology. There are about 58 teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The students attend 50-minute classes a minimum of three times a week, Allen 
said.

BOOKS: TIM O'BRIEN'S NEW WORK FEATURES VIETNAM SCENES, BUT "THE THINGS THEY 
CARRIED" IS NOT ABOUT BULLETS; IT'S ABOUT LOVE AND LIFE AFTER DEATH, HE SAYS.

<P>
Well, of course it's fiction, Tim O'Brien was saying. 
</P>
<P>
He had a big smile on his face, and he was drinking coffee and Kahlua while he 
talked, as little as possible, about his new book, "The Things They Carried" 
(Houghton Mifflin, $18.95). 
</P>
<P>
He was saying it was a novel, fiction, get it? None of it really happened. It 
all came out of the author's head. Honest. 
</P>
<P>
So what if the protagonist of this alleged novel happens to be named, yes, Tim 
O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
So what if, just like the real Tim O'Brien, that character grew up in 
Minnesota, went to Macalester College and did graduate work at Harvard 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Or if both Tim O'Briens were drafted out of college and served 14 months in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Or if both are writers, and both are 43 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it's fiction. It's a novel," the author said. This Tim O'Brien is so real 
that on this frosty Cambridge afternoon he was holed up in one of the town's 
trendier establishments, fortifying himself for a dental appointment and a 
reading at the nearby Brattle Theater. 
</P>
<P>
So how much of that stuff in this book is real? How many of the experiences in 
this rich collection of closely connected short stories and vignettes really 
happened to the Tim O'Brien who arrived for an afternoon encounter looking like 
an aging school kid, wearing jeans and a baseball cap? 
</P>
<P>
"None of it. I made it all up. It's fiction. Stories." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the one in the book, this Tim O'Brien, the putative real one, does not 
have a 9-year-old daughter named Kathleen who rides him relentlessly about his 
role in the Vietnam War, and why he keeps writing about it, why he doesn't 
write instead about something interesting, like someone who finds a million 
dollars and spends it all on a Shetland pony. 
</P>
<P>
"You keep writing these war stories," Kathleen says in the book, "so I guess 
you must've killed somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Because he does not have a daughter named Kathleen, or, for that matter, any 
children, this Tim O'Brien does not respond by taking her on his lap and hoping 
that some day, when she is older, she will ask again. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe if she did O'Brien could tell her why, after writing a nonfiction memoir 
about Vietnam, "If I Die in a Combat Zone," and after winning the American Book 
Award in 1979 for a novel about Vietnam, "Going After Cacciato," he continues 
to write about that war in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"Because there are all these great stories," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing else ever happens in my life, and you've got to do something, you've 
got to write about something. All these interesting things happened in Vietnam. 
If you're a writer, and you've got all these memories like I've got, you'd be 
crazy not to use them." 
</P>
<P>
After "Cacciato," the comparison "is inevitable." O'Brien knows that. An editor 
who first heard his proposal to write about Vietnam almost 20 years ago 
discouraged him. Why did he want to write about something depressing like war? 
And why, that editor might ask, does he keep harping about that same wretched 
war? 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, the real one, knows that the analogy he is about to make may sound 
lofty or even self-serving. But he makes it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like Shakespeare has written Henry IV and he does Richard III, and people 
say, 'Oh, no, another king story,' " O'Brien said. "They are utterly different. 
The hearts of these stories are utterly different. It's not about kings at all. 
It's about hearts and souls." 
</P>
<P>
This Tim O'Brien, the Tim O'Brien who is nervous about his dental appointment, 
who has brought a suit to change into for his reading, because "my publisher 
would kill me if I went like this," did not have a childhood sweetheart named 
Linda who died of cancer. The waxy sweet smell of the funeral home where Linda 
is laid out leaps off the pages of "The Things They Carried," but even that 
scene, O'Brien insists, is entirely invented. No youthful love, no tragic 
death, no imaginary conversations with a Linda who returned to life and asked, 
"Do I look dead?" 
</P>
<P>
So far as this Tim O'Brien remembers, no one in his acquaintance in Vietnam 
imported a girlfriend from the United States. The nonexistent all-American girl 
did not become infatuated with the war; she did not wear a necklace made of 
human tongues and wander into the combat arena. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, the author, makes it seem so genuine. He was there, wasn't he? But 
then he teases his reader, insisting in a brief epigraph that "all the 
incidents, names and characters . . . are imaginary." As a further joust, 
O'Brien turns around and dedicates "The Things They Carried" to "the men of 
Alpha Company," his supposedly make-believe unit in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
But some things in O'Brien's new book, OK, maybe just a few things, are at 
least semi-authentic. O'Brien did do his infantry training in Washington state, 
site of the haunting "On the Rainy River." He did think about fleeing to 
Canada, and even went so far as to call the Vancouver travel bureau for 
information. 
</P>
<P>
"There was this nice lady who answered the phone, and she said 'Can I send you 
any brochures?' " O'Brien recalled. It makes him laugh to think about it now, 
travel posters of scenic Canada coming to a kid in infantry training, on his 
way to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
He replied, "Not to Ft. Lewis, thanks." 
</P>
<P>
So "some of it is true," O'Brien finally conceded. "Not in the literal sense," 
more in "the way I worried about it, about being judged." 
</P>
<P>
Just "21, 22, I don't know, however old you are when you get out of college," 
O'Brien said he was squeezed in a moral dilemma of that era. "I wanted to save 
my honor and, at the same time, not go fight that war. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that I am as old as I am, I like to think I wouldn't have gone. But until 
you are in that position of having to make a choice like that, you have to 
believe you would do the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Until you are in that situation, it's easy to believe, 'well sure, I'm a 
hero,' but then you're in that situation." It is not so easy, not so clear, 
O'Brien was saying. 
</P>
<P>
It was a terrible choice for so many thousands of young men, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My intellect was saying, 'run to Canada,' but my emotions were saying, 'what's 
your dad going to say?' 
</P>
<P>
"And you've got this girlfriend, what's she going to say? You're 21 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, O'Brien said, "I bet you a lot of guys went to that war for the 
reasons I did, because they were afraid of being embarrassed in front of their 
parents or girlfriends." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien may write about Vietnam, but he does not live, eat, sleep, breathe 
Vietnam. This is not a guy who has nightmares about battles, "all that 
simpering Vietnam veteran stuff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He has just read Shelby Foote's three-volume history of the Civil War. "Now 
that was an awful war," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It is arguable, O'Brien agrees, that cynics might charge him with exploiting 
the war in Vietnam, of obsessing in print about his experiences there. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be exploitative," he said. "But art exploits. Homer exploited the 
Trojan wars, and thank God." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Vietnam, "I'm hoping art will salvage the exploitation," he 
said. "The whole purpose is to try to get something beautiful out of that awful 
war." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, O'Brien said, "that's the neat thing about books. That's how culture 
survives." Fiction, he said, "keeps it alive. 
</P>
<P>
"One function of art is to shape the cultural memory," O'Brien said. "The 
details of what actually happened are eventually going to vanish. People may 
remember the Gulf of Tonkin or Tet, but most of that stuff will be lost. The 
details of Vietnam will be gone, and what we will have left is its 
aimlessness." 
</P>
<P>
He returned to his early comparison: "What do we remember from the Trojan War? 
It's from Homer. Nothing else is left." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, O'Brien said he named his central character after himself "just for 
fun," and because it's a "neat" idea. "There's a certain joy to it. It frees 
you to do anything you want. When you start telling lies about yourself -- 
well, if you do it credibly, the reader is going to believe you. 
</P>
<P>
"I found it really liberating," he said. "You open doors by lying about 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
The whole point of this book, O'Brien said, was "to touch people's hearts and 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
"Mainly I want to give a sort of full-bodied pleasure," he said, smiling 
playfully. "Like Pepsi cola. You know, it tingles." 
</P>
<P>
And finally, what he was writing about in the four years it took him to 
complete this book was not about "the stuff of war, bombs and bullets." 
</P>
<P>
This new book "is about people being just and brave," he said. "It's about 
love, and God, and life after death." 
</P>
<P>
He stood up and got ready to head off to the dentist. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not even a novel, really," Tim O'Brien said. "It's a book."

Mabel Glenn, 86, gripped her 6-foot cue stick with grim determination and 
gazed, steely-eyed, at the triangular-shaped box at the far end of the court. 
</P>
<P>
WHAM! 
</P>
<P>
It was her hammer shot -- the last of her four discs to be played. She blasted 
her opponent's black disc out of the 10-point spot, and replaced it with her 
own. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I play Mabel, she beats me. My God, that woman has keen eyes. 
Shufflers have a saying: 'Watch out for little old ladies in white sneakers, 
they'll kill you,' " laughed Frank Howard, 76, a husky 6-foot player. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn is only 4-foot-10 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
But she's no run-of-the-mill shuffleboard player. She's one of America's 80 top 
players and has been inducted in the National Shuffleboard Hall of Fame, which 
is on the grounds of the St. Petersburg Shuffleboard Club. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn won the women's national championship five years ago, when she was 81, 
the latest of a string of major tournaments she won in more than 40 years of 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"I play five days a week. It takes constant practice to stay competitive," 
insisted Glenn, who with her late husband owned a Studebaker agency in South 
Bend, Ind. "How many 86-year-old women can bend down and touch their toes, 
still feel their ribs? Shuffling keeps me young." 
</P>
<P>
St. Petersburg -- named after the city in Russia, hometown of Peter Demens, who 
brought the railroad here in 1885 -- is the shuffleboard capital of America. 
</P>
<P>
"The St. Petersburg Shuffleboard Club became the first shuffleboard club 
established in the world in 1924. It has more courts (60) and more members 
(450) than any other shuffleboard club anywhere," explained Ellen Anderson, 63, 
the club's president. 
</P>
<P>
In 1947, at the peak of its membership, the St. Petersburg club had 8,331 
members. "Our membership took a nose dive in recent years, because all of the 
motor home parks established their own clubs, and drained off our membership, 
but we're experiencing a renaissance," said Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
All the courts were resurfaced late last year. The club's ballroom, bridge and 
bingo auditorium, checker rooms, offices and club house were painted and 
renovated a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Many top tournaments are played at the St. Petersburg club, including the 
annual masters play, featuring the best 16 men and best 16 women players in the 
world. The international tournament has been played here, with leading 
shufflers from Australia, Japan, Canada and the U.S. competing. 
</P>
<P>
During its heyday "St. Pete's" Club, as it is affectionately called, had its 
own 25-member orchestra, made up of shuffleboard players. It still has its own 
band, playing Saturday night dances, a tradition dating back to 1930. 
</P>
<P>
St. Petersburg has been a favorite retirement area, ever since the 1880s, when 
the American Medical Assn. called it one of the healthiest places to live. 
</P>
<P>
Shuffleboard originally called shoofleboord has been a popular deck sport on 
ocean-going liners since the early 1800s. It went ashore in 1913 in Daytona 
Beach, when Robert Ball and his wife created a court at their Lyndhurst Hotel 
for guests to amuse themselves. The next place to have a shuffleboard court was 
the St. Petersburg club. Retired people wintering in Florida picked up on the 
game, and the rest is history. 
</P>
<P>
"Retirees have been wintering here for more than a century, but it is 
shuffleboard that really put St. Petersburg on the map," said club president 
Anderson, who retired here eight years ago with her husband. They owned a 
plaster statue business in New York. "This was a sleepy one-horse town, until 
shuffleboard came along. 
</P>
<P>
"This club was responsible for the growth of St. Petersburg. Retirees headed 
for St. Pete's in droves in their tin lizzies on dirt roads in the winter 
months to shuffle. The thousands of shufflers pour money into the area." 
</P>
<P>
Today, more than 50,000 players are members of shuffleboard clubs in Florida. 
The St. Petersburg club is the national shrine of the sport. The club office is 
filled with cue sticks, willed by members who die. Visitors may rent these 
treasured cues for $1. Members and others often bequeath some or all of their 
estates to the St. Petersburg club. Three years ago, club member Beulah Dunbar, 
95, died, and left the club $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the game's best players have been members of the "St. Pete" club, 
including Mae Hall, now in her 90s, heralded as "the greatest shuffler in the 
history of the sport." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the hallowed Shuffleboard Hall of Fame is the world's only shuffleboard 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
Average age of players is 65. Anderson explained it's the game of the retired 
set, because they have the time to practice five to seven days a week and to 
pursue league and tournament play. They also don't seem to mind that the purses 
for winners are minimal, with top prizes usually under $50. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Pete club president plays a mean game. On her desk is a plaque with the 
words "It's Hard to Be Humble When You're Great." 
</P>
<P>
"There is drama on the court every day," said Anderson, born in the Bronx, and 
graduate of Roosevelt High School in Yonkers. "These people are addicted to the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
"In a recent club tournament, a 75-year-old man threw his cue stick over the 
club house like a javelin, when he missed a key shot. An 80-year-old man broke 
his stick over his knees." 
</P>
<P>
Men and women compete on an equal basis. Some play singles, one person against 
another, while others play team, with four players, two on each side. First 
player or team to score 75 points wins. 
</P>
<P>
Players push four discs each in alternate fashion down the court with their 
cues. Their shots are described as bumping, doubling, snuggling, caroms, 
kitchen shots and backstop shots. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Wolf, 70, known by shufflers from coast to coast as "Mr. Shuffleboard," 
has been a wheelchair player 45 years. He was paralyzed after being shot in 
battle in the Philippines in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf, secretary of the National Shuffleboard Assn., is the sport's official 
statistician and historian. He estimates there are more than 1 million active 
shufflers in the United States; the No. 1 shuffleboard state, he says, is 
Florida, closely followed by California and Arizona. The sport is played in all 
50 states and is also popular in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the sport's leading players are at their peak performance in their 70s 
and 80s. It is not unusual to have players in their 90s, burning up the courts, 
and wiping out their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"Shuffling is one of the most complicated games played. It takes tremendous 
concentration and skill," insisted "Mr. Shuffleboard."

KANGAROO ISLAND, A PERFECT PLACE TO SEE AUSTRALIA IN THE WILD

KANGAROO ISLAND, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here on Kangaroo Island, sighting a platypus is the ultimate treat for those 
who come to see animals and birds in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
While some people imagine that in Australia koalas hang from the trees like 
grapes and that kangaroos line up waving "welcome" signs, it just isn't so. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, the country has scores of zoos and animal parks where you can see 
everything from wombats to Tasmanian Devils, but ogling zoo-ified beasties 
simply is not the same as viewing them in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
To do that, you come here, to Kangaroo Island. 
</P>
<P>
The island lies about 70 miles southwest of Adelaide, about nine miles off the 
South Australia coast. It is Australia's third-largest island, after Tasmania 
and Melville Island in the Northern Territory, and has been called "Australia 
in microcosm" -- the place to go when you want to see all of the country but 
don't have the time. 
</P>
<P>
Shaped something like a startled turtle, its head extended toward the mainland, 
the island is about 95 miles long and 35 miles wide at its widest point. 
</P>
<P>
It's a sparsely populated place, with what passes for urban life concentrated 
in three small towns on the east coast: Kingscote, the largest with a 
population of about 2,000, and the two smaller communities of American River 
and Penneshaw. 
</P>
<P>
I first heard about Kangaroo Island from an Australian friend who used to talk 
about its immense cliffs that reared up from the surf like the ramparts of a 
medieval castle, and about its beautiful, pristine beaches. He talked of scuba 
diving in search of treasure in the ribs of pirate ships, and of the odd little 
fairy penguins. 
</P>
<P>
Since the island lies only about nine miles across the Backstairs Passage from 
Cape Jervis south of Adelaide (where I had gone to sample Australian wines), I 
decided to see for myself whether it lived up to my friend's description. 
</P>
<P>
I was met at the airport in Kingscote by Peter Telfer, the 40-year-old owner of 
Adventure Charters of Kangaroo Island, which had been highly recommended by 
Tourism South Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Telfer, who grew up on the island, has parlayed years of personal exploration 
into a first-class tour and guide service. His chosen mode of transport is a 
high-off-the-ground, four-wheel drive vehicle complete with "roo bars," the 
Australian equivalent of roll bars except that they wrap around the front of 
the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Joining us for the first day of my two-day island tour was Marion Saunders, a 
friend of Telfer's and a former islander herself. Two days was all I had, but 
to thoroughly explore the island and discover why its residents fight so hard 
to keep it unspoiled one really needs a week or more. 
</P>
<P>
Kangaroo Island has been isolated from the mainland since the last Ice Age, and 
its flora and fauna has therefore escaped the ravages of such introduced 
species as the fox and rabbit or the predations of the dingo. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, wildlife flourishes, and visitors can find kangaroos, including 
one species unique to the island, goannas (large lizards), native cats called 
quolls, short-nosed bandicoots (a rat-like marsupial), pygmy possums and 
wallabies in vast abundance, as well as seals, sea lions, fairy penguins, 
koalas, emus, echidnas, platypuses and an Eden of rainbow-colored birds. 
</P>
<P>
The scenery is as varied as the animal life. Much of the interior is farmland 
tucked between gentle hills. Sheep and various crops failed when first 
introduced, but after the soil was improved with minerals, agriculture thrived. 
Away from the cultivated areas, farms give way to scrubland and even desert. On 
the coast, rocky cliffs alternate with white-sand beaches. Island wildflowers 
include orchids, blue asters, golden wattle, rice flowers, fuchsia and purple 
fringe lilies. 
</P>
<P>
My home base on the island was Kingscote on Nepean Bay, where I saw South 
Australia's largest mulberry tree and very little else. To those with more 
time, Kingscote, the state's first settlement, does have a good folk-history 
museum and heritage walking trail. 
</P>
<P>
Day one was an exploration of the northern part of the island. Our first stop 
was alongside a tiny creek shaded by flowering eucalyptus trees, where Telfer 
promised we'd see koalas. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, there they were, draped like drunks in the gum trees. Saunders 
claimed that the gum leaves they eat are narcotic, and the reason they look so 
spaced out is because they're genuinely zonked. Others dispute this and the 
debate goes on. 
</P>
<P>
While Telfer set traps in the creek for "yabbies" (an Australian freshwater 
crayfish), Saunders and I followed kangaroo tracks along the creek. 
</P>
<P>
The variety and color of the birds we saw was stunning: rainbow lorikeets, 
scarlet robins, rosellas and galahs swept from tree to tree in large flocks. 
Galahs, a type of cockatoo, are considered a somewhat dimwitted bird, and 
Australians use the name as a term of derision. To visitors, though, the sight 
of the pink and dove-gray birds flying wild is a delight. 
</P>
<P>
Just as we settled in to sample Telfer's barbecue, Saunders pointed out some 
black-and-white animals in the distance. "Feral goats," she said. On Kangaroo 
Island, the word feral (wild) ranks with some of our more colorful expletives. 
Any introduced animal that can upset the island's ecological balance really 
upsets the native islanders. Later, Saunders pointed out pine trees from North 
America that are gradually taking over from the native gum trees. 
</P>
<P>
One introduced species that has been accepted is the Ligurian bee. No other bee 
has been introduced since 12 hives were brought to Kangaroo Island in 1881 from 
the Italian province of Liguria. So the Ligurian strain has remained pure. 
Today it is a unique species and is exported to apiaries around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Kangaroo Island's attractions hug the coastline. On the northern (and less 
frequented) shore, we climbed Constitution Hill for a bird's-eye view of 
Snelling Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Just east of the hill, we walked through a tunnel formed by a jumble of 
limestone boulders to emerge on a sweeping sandy beach with a small lagoon 
formed by protective rocks. This is Stokes Bay, where fairy penguins come in 
the spring to have their chicks. There were no penguins there during our visit, 
but we did see plovers, red-billed oyster catchers, cormorants, ducks and sooty 
pied oyster catchers. 
</P>
<P>
Kangaroo Island was named by English navigator Matthew Flinders in 1802. Its 
first occupants -- not including the aborigines who had lived there centuries 
before but later abandoned the island -- were bands of deserters from English, 
French and American whaling ships and escapees from the prison colonies. 
Together, they formed marauding bands of cutthroats called "straitsmen" or "sea 
rats." 
</P>
<P>
With Kangaroo Island as their base, these pirates roamed the Australian coast 
in whaleboats, raiding villages, kidnapping women, plundering ships and 
murdering crews. 
</P>
<P>
At sunset, we stopped high on the Wisanger Hills to enjoy a view straight out 
of Africa: sweeping fields of dry grass and scattered trees, with only the 
sound of the wind to break the silence. 
</P>
<P>
On the second day of my visit, we picked up another visitor and then set off 
for Seal Bay, a 2,000-acre conservation area where a breeding colony of more 
than 300 sea lions lay around on the sand barking and basking. 
</P>
<P>
Because of constant contact with friendly islanders and the absence of 
predators, the animals regard people as curiosities and not much more. The sea 
lions and New Zealand fur seals waddle on the sand and barely raise a brown eye 
as visitors walk by or pose for pictures near them. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the mammals take only passing interest in people, it's a good idea 
to get there early in the morning before the crowds -- or what passes for 
crowds -- arrive. It's also advisable not to tease the animals, and to be wary 
of a mother separated from her pup or an amorous male in the February mating 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Near Seal Bay are Vivonne Bay and Hanson Bay, two more of what seems an endless 
stretch of perfect beaches -- great for picnics, bathing, fishing or for 
launching a scuba diving trip. More than 60 wrecked ships have been found 
around the island's 280-mile coastline, and that, coupled with coral reefs and 
clean water, makes this a scuba diver's mecca. Just beyond Vivonne Bay is the 
Little Sahara Desert, an oasis of folding white sand dunes surrounded by bush. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing west, Kelly Hill Conservation Park is a haven for birds and animals, 
and the Kelly Hill Caves offer conducted tours through the calcite formations. 
Then, just a bit farther west, we arrived at the Remarkable Rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Nature, over the centuries, weathered the massive rock formations so that what 
emerged was a collection of weird and surreal towers and forms, precariously 
balanced on a huge granite dome that plunges 90 feet down to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby Admiral's Arch is another work of nature -- an immense cave carved by 
the wind and sea. The best time to see it is in February when hundreds of seals 
and sea lions and their pups use the area for swimming classes. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the island we stopped for lunch at Rocky River, headquarters of 
the 185,000-acre Flinders Chase National Park. Here, it is the visitors who are 
fenced off while the animals hop, waddle, strut and crawl around looking for 
handouts. Under some gum trees, we pulled out a bag of cut-up apples. Young 
kangaroos hopped up and gently took the apples from our hands with their paws. 
</P>
<P>
Emus strut around among the visitors and an echidna roams around in circles not 
really knowing where it's going. Koalas sit in the trees, zonked as usual, Cape 
Barren geese parade around posing for the camera, and galahs, lorikeets and 
cockatoos scream from the trees. The park is also home to about 150 of the rare 
Glossy Black or Casuarina cockatoo that are found only in Australia, but we 
weren't fortunate enough to spot one. 
</P>
<P>
Still, that -- not to mention my failure to sight the elusive platypus -- gave 
me the incentive to pay another visit to Kangaroo Island in the future. 
</P>
<P>

Last week I received a surprise check in the mail from Dallas. It was from the 
Dalfort Corp., formerly Braniff Airways, and the check represented my pro-rata 
share as an unsecured creditor from the 1982 bankruptcy of Braniff. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, in May, 1982, I held an expensive Dallas-Honolulu round-trip 
ticket on Braniff when the airline declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. 
(A newly organized Braniff -- a totally different company -- started up in 
1984. Last Sept. 28, the "new" Braniff also failed.) 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the 1982 Braniff bankruptcy settlement, unsecured creditors like 
myself (and anyone else who holds an airline ticket, for that matter) received 
payments on a pro-rata basis, based on the defunct company's remaining assets. 
</P>
<P>
The check arrived at an interesting time. It was just a year ago this week that 
Eastern Airlines, being struck by its machinists and pilots, declared 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Customers were stranded. About $125 million in tickets were left in the hands 
of some frustrated, angry travelers. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's bankruptcy, however, was not a total surprise. The airline had been 
losing money -- some would say hemorrhaging -- for a number of years. 
</P>
<P>
The airline lost $130.8 million in 1986. The loss was $181.7 million in 1987, 
and a staggering loss of $335.4 million occurred in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the bankruptcy, the airline continued to claim it would soon be out 
of bankruptcy. Eastern sold $650 million in assets to help finance a comeback. 
It cut 600 jobs and imposed temporary pay cuts on about half of its 20,000 
workers. It sold its Latin American routes to American. 
</P>
<P>
One thing is clear: Even with the airline now flying at about 65% of its 
pre-strike activity, there have been more losers than winners as a result of 
the strike and the bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Who are the losers? The nearly 30,000 people at Eastern who no longer have 
jobs, and the thousands of airline passengers who now find themselves 
confronted by higher air fares almost across the board on former Eastern 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
When Eastern first announced the bankruptcy, other airlines rushed to attend 
their own predators' ball. Airlines like American and Pan Am moved quickly into 
Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico, former Eastern strongholds, establishing (or 
increasing) their hub size. 
</P>
<P>
And, while Eastern sold off asset after asset, the losses continued. Before the 
strike, Eastern had 255 planes. By the end of December, that number had been 
cut to 188. Employees shrunk from 32,000 to 20,000, daily flights from 1,100 to 
800. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, travel agents, who account for approximately 75% of 
airline ticket sales, began to desert Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
At this writing, many of Eastern's fares remain substantially below other 
carriers. But the fares aren't being sold by many agents. 
</P>
<P>
Some agents say they don't want to sell the Eastern tickets, fearing liability 
problems if the airline would fail. 
</P>
<P>
Some airline officials argue -- and I agree -- that the reason travel agents 
won't sell the tickets is that many seem more concerned with receiving higher 
commission checks for selling higher air fares on other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
For example, I called one travel agent and asked what the lowest air fare was 
between Atlanta and New York City. I was quoted $301 on Delta. In fact, the 
lowest air fare is $198 on Eastern. And it's refundable! 
</P>
<P>
Another fare comparison: Eastern's lowest fare between Atlanta and Los Angeles 
is $278 with a seven-day advance purchase. But the "lowest" fare I was quoted 
by another travel agent -- again, on Delta -- was $384, with a 14-day advance 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, during a slow traffic period when airlines traditionally offer 
discounts, Eastern slashed many of its fares on popular routes. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, other airlines would rush to match the fares to stay competitive. But 
this year, the other airlines didn't match the fares. 
</P>
<P>
Why? "It's clear," one airline official said. "We no longer consider them 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
But Eastern's problems do not exist alone. Texas Air, Eastern's parent 
corporation, lost a whopping $718 million in 1988. In 1989, the loss was $885 
million. 
</P>
<P>
And recently, a bankruptcy examiner ruled that Texas Air had underpaid Eastern 
for many of its assets. As a result, Texas Air agreed to pay Eastern $280 
million. 
</P>
<P>
That may buy some time for Eastern, but a question remains: How much time? The 
airline claims in its advertisements that it is rebuilding a great airline, 
"one passenger at a time." 
</P>
<P>
At that rate, considering the lack of travel-agent support, the airline may be 
liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
It's also no surprise that the three airlines topping the 1989 U.S. Department 
of Transportation list for passenger complaints concerning quality of service 
were Eastern, Pan Am and TWA. 
</P>
<P>
At TWA, rumors continue that airline officials and pilots are expecting the 
worst: the sale of all or part of the airline. TWA Chairman Carl Icahn may do 
just that. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, part of a major contract signed by TWA pilots restricted Icahn's 
option to sell TWA as long as the airline's financial performance remained 
above a certain level. Analysts projected that the performance would drop below 
that level this year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, TWA has begun to sell some of its 747s to build up some cash 
reserves. (The airline now has long-term debt obligations of more than $2.7 
billion.) 
</P>
<P>
Also it has not been a good year for Pan Am. In 1988, the airline received 
concessions from its unions totaling $500 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1988, came the big blow -- the terrorist bombing of Flight 103 
over Lockerbie, Scotland. Ticket sales plummeted, and continued falling through 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
And now, more than a year after the tragedy, the financially troubled carrier 
is confronted with the possibility that it could run out of cash. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year about this time we all say that we can't wait until summer," one 
Pan Am official said. 
</P>
<P>
The summer season traditionally is the time of year when each airline makes its 
most money. However, with its slow winter travel volume, Pan Am may not be able 
to wait until summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have enough cash to hold on," another official said. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am's chairman, Thomas Plaskett, has publicly stated that the key to Pan 
Am's future is in finding a merger partner. So far, there have been no takers. 
</P>
<P>
What does all this mean to travelers? 
</P>
<P>
In the short run, it is generally expected that Eastern, TWA and Pan Am will 
continue to operate, albeit at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
If you are a member of one the airlines' frequent-flier programs and you have 
amassed substantial mileage, now might be a good time to consider using that 
mileage. 
</P>
<P>
(If an airline fails, travelers with mileage points have little chance to 
redeem those points with another carrier.) 
</P>
<P>
Airlines such as Eastern, TWA and Pan Am also need public support. In a 
business where survival of the fattest seems to be the name of the game, it is 
not in our interests to see airlines fail. 
</P>
<P>
Airline failures so far have led to increased ticket prices and domination of 
certain routes and airports by mega-carriers. 
</P>
<P>
If price is a great motivator, then the public has no reason not to fly 
Eastern, particularly if passengers exercise a couple of common-sense 
precautions. Try to book nonstop flights (as opposed to flights that must 
connect). And always pay with a credit card. 
</P>
<P>
All is not doom and gloom for Eastern, however. The airline has announced that 
it has set aside a $115-million refund plan to pay for outstanding tickets in 
the event the airline goes under. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, I'm tempted to frame my Braniff check instead of deposit it. Why? 
</P>
<P>
My original ticket had been worth $800. As an unsecured creditor, after eight 
years the check I received was for $9.36!

CRUISE VIEWS: VESSEL CONTAINS EVERYTHING FOR CASUAL VOYAGES

<TEXT>
<P>
"If you travel much on cruise ships," James Thurber once wrote, "you are bound, 
sooner or later, to run into Mrs. Abigail Pritchard. She is not one woman, but 
many; I have encountered at least 15 of her." 
</P>
<P>
We didn't encounter any of her incarnations during a recent voyage aboard the 
Club Med I, but we had to wonder what she would have thought of the the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
What, for instance, would she have made of its lack of a dress code? 
</P>
<P>
What would her reaction have been to learn that all prices are in francs? 
</P>
<P>
And, most interesting of all, what would she have thought about all the topless 
sunbathers? 
</P>
<P>
Probably, she would have locked herself in her cabin, which, aboard this new, 
442-passenger cruise ship, might have suited her just fine. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 191 regular cabins on the 610-foot, 9,000-ton Club Med I, 168 have twin 
beds that can be converted to queen size and 23 have a third fold-down berth. 
</P>
<P>
There's plenty of storage space and excellent lighting, mirrored walls, 
mahogany furniture, high-tech modular bathrooms with shower and teak floor, a 
dresser/desk with one chair, refrigerator/mini-bar and a color-TV set that 
plays films, most of them in French, all day long on three channels. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, all cabins have portholes instead of windows. For passengers 
needing more space, there are also two suites and four large inside cabins. 
</P>
<P>
What more could Mrs. Pritchard want? 
</P>
<P>
Well, for one thing, perhaps a professional cruise staff -- those 
silver-haired, deferential gentlemen in navy blazers and white slacks. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, what we found were 64 energetic gentils organisateurs or "congenial 
organizers," who, although not always congenial, usually seemed to be having 
more fun than the passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Take the captain's welcome cocktail party, for instance. Usually, this sort of 
affair means shaking hands with the captain, accepting a drink from a nearby 
waiter and exchanging small talk for an hour or so. 
</P>
<P>
On the Club Med I, we stood around empty-handed while the gentils organisateurs 
performed a musical number about cocktails reminiscent of the shows Judy 
Garland and Mickey Rooney used to put on in grandpa's barn in old MGM movies. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt there are people who enjoy this sort of thing. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the whole shipboard experience is rather like summer camp, Club 
Med-style, except that the famous pop beads have been exchanged for a plastic 
credit card, and the price per passenger, double occupancy, per day, hovers 
from $250-to-$300 range. 
</P>
<P>
Billed as the world's largest sailing ship, the Club Med I unfortunately spends 
most of its daylight hours in port, sails furled. While in port, the ship's 
duty-free shop remains open -- a cruise line first. 
</P>
<P>
Meals are served in an a la carte restaurant called La Louisiane and in an 
informal restaurant called Odyssey, where buffets are set up for breakfast and 
lunch, with fixed-menu steak-and-lobster dinners by reservation at no extra 
charge in the evenings. 
</P>
<P>
The cooking is continental rather than nouvelle, rich in cream and butter 
sauces, with a large serve-yourself salad buffet at lunchtime. Wine is included 
with lunch and dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant and cabin stewards are from Mauritius, the officers French and 
Italian. The ship's registry, however, is Bahamian rather than French. 
</P>
<P>
For night owls, there is a small casino and a glittering disco. 
</P>
<P>
Some pluses: spacious teak decks and indoor/outdoor lounges in tropical and 
nautical colors, a great gym with glass walls facing the sea on two sides and 
top-quality equipment, two good-size swimming pools, telescopes mounted on an 
outdoor deck to view passing ships or a nearby island, a large water-sports 
platform that is left lowered all day as conditions permit when the ship is at 
anchor -- for scuba-diving, snorkeling, water skiing and sailing, two 
elevators, no tipping and no port charges. 
</P>
<P>
Some drawbacks: no designated nonsmoking areas, a chaotic and confusing 
lifeboat drill without ship's officers in evidence, unusually high bar prices 
(highballs $4 and cocktails $6.35), and something that's on no other ship -- 
room service charges on everything but a cabin continental breakfasts. 
</P>
<P>
Fares in the Caribbean this spring are from $275 to $304 per person, double 
occupancy, per day, for the standard cabins, $506 for suites. 
</P>
<P>
Fall Caribbean cruises and summer Mediterranean sailings are somewhat lower, 
about$240 a day per person for standard cabins. 
</P>
<P>
Children must be 12 years and older. Three people sharing a cabin pay $220 per 
person, per day, in the Caribbean, about $160 in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
In the Caribbean, the ship anchors off Iles des Saintes, St. Martin, Virgin 
Gorda, St. Thomas and St. Barts, and docks in San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
While the accent is on water sports, passengers are also offered shopping 
opportunities, car rentals and shore excursions. 
</P>
<P>
Club Med I will continue its Caribbean itinerary through April 21, then will 
sail the Atlantic Ocean on a budget-priced 19-day crossing ($2,280 to $2,480 
per person, double occupancy) before beginning a series of seven-day sailings 
in the Mediterranean.

VISTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This hilly, northern San Diego County city, a must for plant lovers, has at 
least 123 nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
Many sell only to the trade, but others invite visitors to roam their gardens 
and greenhouses. More importantly, the plant prices are often much less than at 
a neighborhood nursery. 
</P>
<P>
Passion fruit and wine grapes were early cash crops for century-old Vista, 
followed by avocados in the 1930s and strawberries today. However, specialty 
plants, including bonsai, herbs and rare fruits, also lure visitors. 
</P>
<P>
During a daylong outing, visitors here can tour the open nurseries, as well as 
a bird farm and an agricultural machinery museum. 
</P>
<P>
For those who get hungry during the day or evening, Vista also has several good 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Start from Los Angeles by driving south on Interstate 5 to the California 
76/Mission Avenue exit just beyond Camp Pendleton. Head east toward Bonsall. 
After about six miles, turn right on San Diego County S14/North Santa Fe Avenue 
to Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the population has more than doubled in the last decade to about 
70,000, the city seems to be sprouting more homes than plants and the nurseries 
are now surrounded by suburban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
About a mile along Santa Fe Avenue, turn right on Darwin Drive to the third set 
of buildings on the left -- the Iwaisako Nursery. Inside the first 
plastic-covered greenhouse are dozens of bonsai -- artistic miniature trees in 
pottery trays. 
</P>
<P>
Keiko Iwaisako and her family grow the tiny trees and shrubs, which include 
juniper, black pine, ginko, maple, azalea, olive and elm varieties. 
</P>
<P>
Prices begin at $25-$30, and go as high as $495 for bonsai that are 20 years 
old. Flowers, house plants and full-size shrubs and trees also are sold at the 
nursery, which is open daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
On North Santa Fe Avenue, look left for a round, outdoor aviary and turn left 
at No. 2511 into the California Bird Farm. While walking around the enclosure, 
visitors will see raucous laughing thrush, peacocks and ring-necked doves. 
Chukars are in another cage. 
</P>
<P>
Lupe and Louis Quesada have more than 300 birds at their farm, which 
specializes in cockateels, including albino and pied varieties, and 
multicolored love birds. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors also will see zebra finches and American singing canaries and parrots, 
such as a double yellow-headed Amazon and a green-winged macaw. Daily business 
hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; closed Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Continue driving south on North Santa Fe Avenue to No. 2040 and a vintage 
tractor that marks the entrance to the Antique Gas and Steam Engine Museum, 
Vista's best-known attraction. 
</P>
<P>
You'll pass a field of wheat shoots before reaching the office, where you can 
get self-guiding tour maps of the 40-acres that display vintage tractors and 
other farm machinery. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of implements used in California agriculture between 1900 and 1930 are 
on exhibit. Every June and October the museum comes to life during Threshing 
Bee and Antique Engine shows, when demonstrations include steam-powered 
harvesters mowing the newly grown wheat. Admission free to this outdoor museum, 
which is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Continue south to Bobier Drive and turn left to East Vista Way, where the 
Cambridge Inn is in a shopping center just before the junction. 
</P>
<P>
The inn is a local favorite for home-style cooking. Or cross Vista Way to the 
shopping center on the opposite side for two other popular restaurants -- 
Siciliano's and the Peking Wok. 
</P>
<P>
Drive north on Vista Way and, just beyond Osborne Street, look left for the 
entrance sign to Exotica, a nursery featuring rare fruit trees and other plants 
from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, owners Jessica Leaf and Steven Spangler relocated their small 
Garden of Eden from Laurel Canyon in Los Angeles to Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Signs identify the trees and describe their flowers. Many varieties can be used 
for landscaping as well for fruit. Among the 500 species are guava, lychee, 
cherimoya, mango, sapote and passion, plus 30 varieties of banana. 
</P>
<P>
Look for rare golden-striped timber bamboo and thorny silk floss that produce 
orchid-like flowers. Ripe fruit is often displayed on a tray at this unusual 
nursery, which is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Return south on Vista Way to Santa Fe Avenue and turn left to Escondido Avenue. 
Turn right and cross over the freeway, where the street becomes Sunset Drive 
and winds to No. 1408. 
</P>
<P>
Turn left up the drive to Kartuz Greenhouses, a small nursery that sends 
miniature subtropicals and other plants to collectors across the country. Some 
are multicolored hybrids of cape primrose developed by owner Michael Kartuz. 
</P>
<P>
Also being grown are rare begonias, African violets, passion flowers and plants 
for terrariums. Prices start at $2.50. The nursery is open 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Wednesday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Return to Santa Fe Avenue and turn right, continuing south through town. Soon 
after crossing the railroad tracks, turn left onto Buena Creek Road. Go about 
three-quarters of a mile and turn right onto Lone Oak Road for Taylor's Herb 
Gardens, marked only by the name on a mailbox at No. 1535. 
</P>
<P>
Opposite the parking area are thousands of small plastic containers with more 
than 130 varieties of herbs. Taylor's is the West Coast's largest herb grower. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors are welcome at the nursery weekdays from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and 
Saturdays from 8 a.m. until noon; closed Sundays. Pick up a catalogue that 
describes the herbs, then take your pick of the 2 1/2-inch pots that are $1.35 
each. 
</P>
<P>
To learn more about the plants from owner Kent Taylor and other herbalists, 
join a free tour of the 25-acre garden that begins at 11 a.m. on the first 
Saturday of every month. 
</P>
<P>
Drive back to Santa Fe Avenue and turn right, then go left almost immediately 
at the freeway sign and follow Robelini Drive and Sycamore Avenue to the 
California 78 freeway. Head toward Oceanside to rejoin Interstate 5 back to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip from Los Angeles to Vista is 210 miles. 
</P>
<P>
For a detailed street map ($2) and list of restaurants, visit the red 
turn-of-the-century Santa Fe Railroad depot that is now home to the Vista 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
It's at Washington Street and Indiana Avenue, near the junction of Santa Fe 
Avenue and Vista Way. Office hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays. Call (619) 
726-1122 for more information.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: CORNERING FLAVORS OF IRISH WHISKEY IN DUBLIN 
</P>

DUBLIN, Ireland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can enjoy a sip of Irish whiskey almost anywhere in the world, but for a 
lesson in it, as well as a taste or five, try Dublin's Irish Whiskey Corner. 
</P>
<P>
There, in an old, restored warehouse on Bow Street in the Smithfield section of 
the Irish capital, visitors can sample a selection of Irish whiskey for the 
modest price of $1.50 per person. 
</P>
<P>
At this quaint retreat, showplace and museum, which once belonged to John 
Jameson Distillery, guests are entertained with tales of Irish whiskey, 
wonderful old photographs and drawings, informative displays and a film showing 
how Irish whiskey is fashioned from barley grain, crystal-clear water and 
yeast. 
</P>
<P>
And when they've tired of history, visitors may taste the best and most popular 
Irish whiskeys -- many of which are not available in the United States -- 
before selecting a bottle to take back home. 
</P>
<P>
At Irish Whiskey Corner tastings, five shot glasses are filled with different 
kinds of Irish whiskey and are set out for sampling. 
</P>
<P>
Each label has its own character. There's light and mellow Jameson, the world's 
largest selling Irish whiskey, often served on the rocks; mild and malty 
Bushmills, often sipped straight up; Paddy, smooth and light with a hint of 
maltiness, popular in Ireland; John Power &amp; Son, Ireland's most popular 
label, which has a rich flavor enhanced by malt undertones, usually served 
half-and-half with water, and Tullamore Dew, light and delicate with a 
well-balanced flavor, usually served with ice and water. 
</P>
<P>
Tasters sip each to select a favorite, which they then compare to their 
favorite labels of Scotch whiskey, and with American-made bourbon. Needless to 
say, discussion is lively. 
</P>
<P>
Although there's serious debate in Ireland about whether whiskey was discovered 
or invented, nobody doubts that Christian missionary monks brought with them a 
device called the alembic, a small still invented in the Middle East that was 
used to make alcohol for perfumes. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish soon learned how to use it to distill alcohol from a fermented mash 
of barley and water. They called the beverage uisce beatha (pronounced 
ish-ke-ba-ha) -- Gaelic for "water of life." 
</P>
<P>
Today, we know that beverage as Irish whiskey. Although the anniversary of its 
invention has not been commemorated with annual celebrations, the "water of 
life" has been an integral part of celebrations and anniversaries since it was 
first sipped in Ireland, way back when. 
</P>
<P>
The drink has an historical following that reads like Who's Who. It was a 
favorite of Queen Elizabeth I and Peter the Great. Sir Walter Raleigh once 
stopped off in Cork on his way to the New World to pick up, in his words, "a 
supreme present of a 32-gallon cask of the Earl of Cork's home-distilled uisce 
beatha." 
</P>
<P>
Historians say the word "whiskey" was first used in about 1171, when the 
soldiers of England's Henry II invaded Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
While these uninvited guests were greatly taken with Irish whiskey, they 
couldn't get their tongues to negotiate the words, which were anglicized to 
"fuisce" and finally to "whiskey." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Irish and Americans spell that name "whiskey," while Scots and 
Canadians spell it "whisky," without the "e." 
</P>
<P>
However it's spelled, Irish whiskey is made of both fresh and malted barley 
used in varying amounts to create single and double malts. Government 
regulations define Irish whiskey: how it is made, from which materials and for 
how long it is to be matured. 
</P>
<P>
Malted barley is made by steeping in water. It then is allowed to sprout. The 
germination produces diastase, an enzyme that converts starch in the barley to 
fermentable sugars. 
</P>
<P>
It then is dried in in closed kilns, a method that gives Irish whiskey a clean, 
barley taste unlike the smokey flavor that results when malted barley is dried 
over open peat fires, as it is in making Scotch whiskey. A mixture of fresh and 
malted barley is combined with liquid yeast and allowed to ferment. 
</P>

Irish whiskey requires a triple distillation process in a series of stills to 
refine and strengthen the flavors. It is then placed in oak casks and kept in 
dark, cool warehouses for at least three, and possibly as long as 12, years 
while the whiskey matures. 
</P>
<P>
Each oak cask has its own character and adds a different flavor to the maturing 
whiskey. Ultimately the contents of the casks are blended in huge vats from 
which bottles of whiskey are drawn. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Ireland had dozens of small, independent whiskey-making 
distilleries but there has been considerable consolidation in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Today there are about a dozen brands of Irish whiskey, each of which produces 
several grades, from low-priced to super-premium in quality. And all of it is 
made at just two locations. 
</P>
<P>
Bushmills, the oldest licensed whiskey distillery in the world, with a license 
dating back to 1608, is still in operation in Northern Ireland in County 
Antrim. 
</P>
<P>
The other brands are made at Midleton, a modern distillery opened in 1975 in 
County Cork in the Republic of Ireland. All are associates of the Irish 
Distillers Group, which owns and runs Irish Whiskey Corner. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the 12 kinds of Irish whiskey are available in the United States. Those 
that are include high-priced premiums (Jameson and Bushmills), super-premium 
(Black Bush and Jameson 1780) and super-super-premium (Midleton Very Rare, 
available in only limited supply). 
</P>
<P>
Other Irish whiskeys, including Paddy, Power, Dunphy and Murphy, were 
distributed in the U.S. and some stock still remains on liquor store shelves, 
until about two years ago when exportation was discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
That makes all the more reason for sampling the real thing at Irish Whiskey 
Corner. In addition, Irish whiskey is sold there at very good prices. 
</P>
<P>
Numbered bottles of Midleton Very Rare, considered to be best in quality among 
the Irish whiskeys, costs about $60 at Irish Whiskey Corner. Dublin high street 
prices for Midleton Very Rare -- if it can be found -- are about $75 to $83, 
while it costs $90 to $100 in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Irish Whiskey Corner sells Jamesons 1780 and Bushmills single malt for $26 per 
liter, Black Bush for about $22 per liter (compared with a U.S.-price of about 
$25 for a smaller fifth) and Paddy, Power, Tullamore Dew and Jameson for about 
$20 per liter. 
</P>
<P>
Those more interested in the history than the drinking of Irish whiskey can 
drop by the Irish Whiskey Corner shop to buy T-shirts ($10), sweatshirts ($18), 
ice buckets ($10) and jugs ($10), as well as handsome crystal decanters and 
sets of drinking glasses (up to $300). 
</P>
<P>
Shannon Airport Duty Free Shop sells a variety of Irish whiskeys at prices 
similar to those at Irish Whiskey Corner, but the selection isn't as complete, 
nor are there any free tastings. 
</P>
<P>
For those who wait until the very last minute to stock up on uisce beatha, Aer 
Lingus offers half-liter bottles of Paddys and Jameson for about $7 in its 
in-flight shop. 
</P>
<P>
To make reservations, contact the Irish Whiskey Corner at Bow Street, Dublin 7.

VACATION MEMORIES;

<P>
OH, TO BE IN IRELAND NOW THAT WINTER IS HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE O'NEIL, O'Neil is a free-lance writer living in Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Just wait until St. Patrick's Day," everyone told us during our year's 
sabbatical in Ireland. "That's when the Yanks start coming, and from then until 
September, nothing will be the same." 
</P>
<P>
In Ireland, where left can mean right when it comes to directions, we weren't 
surprised that America's great day for the Irish should be considered a great 
day for Americans. What we didn't expect was that by March 17 -- six months 
into our stay -- the visiting Americans, instead of reminding us of home, would 
seem more like foreigners from a country we'd never seen. 
</P>
<P>
But we had been discarding expectations almost since we arrived. The Ireland of 
travel advertisements, of smiling green fields and light-hearted people, had 
vanished in the first cold winds of September, replaced by a weather-battered 
island in the North Atlantic. The country we hoped to visit was closed until 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Whipped by gale-force winds, capped by rain-laden clouds and making do with a 
bare seven hours of daylight, Ireland in winter offers daily life as a 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
We huddled at bus stops in driving rain, our umbrellas inside out, and hurried 
home to turf fires that took the chill off the central heating. The people we 
met were a quiet lot, as subdued by the climate as we were. They were helpful 
and friendly when called on, but with a reserve not too different from their 
British neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Indoors, in pubs and homes where sensible people spent as much time as 
possible, we found the free-flowing talk we expected, good-natured and witty. 
Yet beneath the apparent frankness lay a formality that was rarely breached -- 
a counterpart to the low walls that enclose every Irish home and property, 
brick in the city, stone in the country. 
</P>
<P>
We noticed other, invisible, walls. They surrounded men parked in cars along 
the sea front reading newspapers; mid-winter swimmers changing clothes behind 
deftly moving towels, confident that passers-by would pay no attention; and a 
long-haired man perched on a Dublin trash can, reading Machiavelli as 
fashionable shoppers brushed past. In a country where climate, politics and 
economics do not make life easy, a buffer of privacy -- especially in public -- 
cushions the edges of reality. 
</P>
<P>
Even the children impressed us with their courtesy. Our daughter's friends 
pursed their lips and told of "bold" children at school -- "boldness" covering 
a range of self-assertion much of which might go unnoticed in an American 
school. It was time for us to measure up. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-March we were blending in like a subtly different shade in a well-worn 
tweed -- softening voices, buttoning up manners and never intruding on a new 
acquaintance by asking that staple of American conversation, "What do you do?" 
One of our Irish friends complimented us, "I thought all Americans sounded like 
'I Love Lucy'; I never met any like you." 
</P>
<P>
And then the Americans came, as we had been told they would. 
</P>
<P>
The bank was crowded at lunchtime a few days before St. Patrick's Day when, 
over the usual melodious murmur, came a flat nasal voice, startling as the slap 
of a beaver tail on a rippling brook. 
</P>
<P>
"George," it called from two lines over, and the ripples dissolved into 
silence. "Mildred said she'd meet you back at the hotel at one. She went 
looking for those sweaters." 
</P>
<P>
"Sssh," I wanted to whisper, "we don't do that here." The murmurs began again 
and I waited my turn, hoping my American accent would pass unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
Although spring in Ireland reportedly begins on Feb. 1, St. Patrick's Day was 
damp and gray, not too different from any other that winter when it didn't 
happen to be raining or blowing up a gale. Except along the parade route, the 
streets of Dublin were deserted, businesses closed for the holiday, pubs for 
the holy day. 
</P>
<P>
If St. Patrick had obliged with a summer feast, the Irish might rival the 
Italians or Spanish in honoring their saint, but on a raw day in the northern 
latitudes spontaneity took second place to cold feet and chattering teeth. It 
was determination, not high spirits, we applauded, as bands, youth groups and 
civic and religious organizations paraded by. 
</P>
<P>
One float made a brave show of rising above the weather: half a dozen young 
women in white strapless gowns gathered around a "queen" in a glittering tiara, 
their arms and shoulders the pale purple of swimmers emerging from the Irish 
Sea in January. We hoped they wouldn't catch pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
Then, just at the end of the parade, the American contingents came into sight 
and the tempo picked up. The Emerald Society Band of the Boston Police 
Department marched tall and proud, 20th-Century pilgrims with drums and brass, 
come 3,000 miles to celebrate their Irish roots. 
</P>
<P>
Busloads of tourists followed, smiling and waving from windows or walking 
alongside to greet the crowd. These Americans were bigger than the Irish we 
were used to, well-fed and well-preserved. 
</P>
<P>
"American women don't get old," I had been hearing for months, and the 
middle-aged blondes in pastel pantsuits seemed to prove it. They flitted like 
matronly fairies in a land of sober woolens. 
</P>
<P>
American enthusiasm was too much for a nearby 12-year-old. "These Yanks think 
they're so great," she muttered to a friend. 
</P>
<P>
I knew it wasn't true, but I couldn't hope to explain in a few minutes what had 
taken us months to understand. In understated Dublin, American self-confidence 
looked suspiciously like boldness, the bane of every Irish child. Whatever 
their ancestry, these Americans were indeed a foreign breed. 
</P>
<P>
After March 17, American voices were everywhere, asking directions, sharing 
reactions and preparing us for our return home. 
</P>
<P>
We left Ireland in June during a 75-degree heat wave, while year-round 
residents peeled off layers of clothing and stretched toe-to-toe in every beach 
and park, soaking up the sun. It took us longer to shed the protective coloring 
we had acquired over 10 months, often unknowingly. 
</P>
<P>
In France and Italy, when we passed for English, we found it amusing. But the 
closer we got to home the less funny it seemed. On our last night in Europe a 
couple from Chicago let us know how much we had changed. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way you're Americans," the man said. "Just listen to your little 
girl; nobody from New Jersey ever talked like that." We convinced him with our 
passports, but began to wonder what we had done to ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants tell of their joy at first sight of the Statue of Liberty; I think 
instead of two ordinary moments when -- out of the confusion of moving a family 
of four, their necessities and would-be necessities across the ocean -- came 
the clear, sure realization that we were back where we belonged. 
</P>
<P>
We were in central New Jersey by the time I emerged from the daze of customs, 
traffic and family reunions. Green suburban lawns rolled past, one into 
another, not a brick or stone wall in sight. We were in a young country, 
optimistic and open, with none of the caution bred by centuries of conflict. It 
felt right. 
</P>
<P>
My confusion returned next morning at the supermarket. The endless display of 
familiar and unfamiliar products, people I might know and had forgotten -- 
decisions pressed in on me. 
</P>
<P>
The woman behind the deli counter (I was sure she was new since last year) 
smiled brightly at me. "Hi, hon," she made room for herself in my crowded 
consciousness. "How are you today?" 
</P>
<P>
I needed an easier question, but it didn't matter. I retrieved my American 
smile from where I had left it in storage and plunged ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"Fine, thanks," I said. "How about you?"

LACKING DIRECTION

<P>
Not only would Steinbeck have trouble writing about Cannery Row ("Even 
Steinbeck Might Have Trouble Writing About Cannery Row Today," Feb. 18). 
</P>
<P>
So did Phyllis J. Hanniver. She should have a better sense of the directions 
and geography of the Monterey area, living as she does in Seaside. The Monterey 
Aquarium is at the north, not south, end of Cannery Row. All the other 
directions are also incorrect. To go east on David Avenue would put one in the 
bay. I suppose, in a relative sense, one travels south along the coast from San 
Francisco, but it would be a surprise to see the sun rise in the west, even in 
a relative sense.

BAPTISM OF OIL, MALATHION GREENS O.C.'S LEGISLATORS 
</P>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the environmental movement were a tent revival meeting, the faithful would 
be shouting hallelujahs. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the non-believing legislators from Orange County -- recently 
chastened by the sheen of oil on their beaches and the mist of malathion on 
their constituents -- now say they have seen the light and are rushing to pass 
a series of laws and resolutions that call for either spending money or 
increasing government regulation to protect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent conversion is especially ironic to longtime environmentalists, who 
have come to regard Orange County legislators as bitter adversaries on issues 
ranging from air pollution to preserving ancient forests. 
</P>
<P>
"Both with the malathion and the oil spill, I think we've seen some 
'born-again' environmentalists," said Mike Paparian, state director of the 
Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) quipped: "Some of these Rip Van Winkles 
are waking up, and I think it's good." 
</P>
<P>
So far, county lawmakers have rushed to write or co-sponsor four bills and 
resolutions in response to the state's aerial eradication effort against the 
Mediterranean fruit fly, which began Nov. 30 in Brea, only to be expanded over 
36 square miles around Garden Grove and Westminster by late January. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in reaction to the Feb. 7 oil spill off Huntington Beach -- an 
environmental insult that made international news -- the Orange County 
delegation has offered or co-authored five measures that take the 
uncharacteristic approach of insisting on greater government regulation, 
including a demand for double-hulled vessels and large fines against oil 
companies involved in future spills. 
</P>
<P>
The spate of legislative activity has underscored a decided greening of county 
officials. With the exception of state Sens. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) 
and Cecil N. Greene (D-Norwalk), the rest of the delegation from the state's 
third-largest county has earned such a bad reputation in environmental circles 
that one activist recently called county legislators a "cancer in the state." 
</P>
<P>
Especially repugnant to traditional environmentalists have been three county 
assemblymen: Gil Ferguson of Newport Beach, Nolan Frizzelle of Huntington Beach 
and Dennis Brown of Los Alamitos. Their votes on 40 issues last year were so 
anti-environmental that the San Francisco-based California League of 
Conservation Voters named them among the Legislature's "Filthy Five." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, in particular, is known around the Capitol as a legislator who would 
rather bite off his own hand than vote for government regulation or a tax 
increase, which most environmental measures involve. 
</P>
<P>
But several days after the American Trader ran over its own anchor and began to 
ooze crude oil onto beaches in his district, Brown signed up as a co-author on 
legislation that would stiffen regulation of tankers and impose large fines for 
future spills. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, it was a consequence" of the spill, Brown said, adding that he is not 
enthralled with the measure. "Had it not been for the spill, I'm sure I would 
not have signed onto it." 
</P>
<P>
And Frizzelle, who was quick to blame environmentalist-inspired regulations for 
the American Trader spill last month, ended up delighting those same people by 
casting a key vote to get new tanker regulations out of an Assembly committee 
two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't vote the way I voted to become some sort of environmentalist," 
Frizzelle said, adding that he supported the measure in exchange for some 
promised changes down the line. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone from the county is jumping on the environmental bandwagon these 
days, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Minority Leader Ross Johnson (R-La Habra) said last week that it would 
be "hypocritical" for him to raise a fuss about the malathion spraying because 
he supported similar eradication efforts in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"The neighbors, many of them, were out there covering their cars," he said 
about the first malathion spraying of his home. "I said, 'The hell with it.' I 
got the car washed a week later." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange) has also declined to share in the spate of 
county legislation. Lewis, who has one of the lowest environmental rankings in 
the Legislature, did not return telephone calls last week. 
</P>
<P>
Those signs are enough to make some mainstream environmentalists, such as Paula 
Carrell of the Sierra Club, openly skeptical that any Orange County conversion 
will stick. 
</P>
<P>
A lobbyist for the 160,000-member Sierra Club, Carrell is quick to point out 
that the delegation's "voting record clearly shows a lack of concern for 
environmental values." 
</P>
<P>
"Their sudden conversion is a reflection of the crisis in their back yards -- a 
crisis that occurred because of a history of refusing to prevent the crisis in 
the first place," Carrell said. "They only care when it is in their back yard, 
but they don't care about the environment generally." 
</P>
<P>
Lucy Blake, executive director of the 30,000-member League of Conservation 
Voters, was a bit more charitable: "Clearly, when the oil began washing up on 
the beach, there were a lot of brand-new environmentalists out there. At my 
most optimistic, I can say I'm encouraged, and I'm glad we see a lot of people 
concerned about these issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Being more cynical, it might be fair to say that some of these people are 
doing a little electioneering." 
</P>
<P>
One legislator feeling the heat these days is Ferguson, who has drawn a serious 
challenger in this year's Republican primary. The challenger, Phyllis Badham, 
said she plans to use the environment as an issue against the former employee 
of the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson has consistently drawn the ire of the Conservation League and the 
Sierra Club for sponsoring pro-development measures, including a 1986 bill that 
would have nullified several local growth-control initiatives and gutted other 
regulatory tools, such as open-space zones and density restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson also voted against the 1986 law that holds oil companies financially 
responsible for spills -- the same law under which British Petroleum and its 
tanker company paid for the cleanup in Ferguson's district. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the spill, however, the avowed conservative said he is working 
on two bills that would encourage the state to use new technology to clean up 
future slicks, as well as train cleanup volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"I might not be your definition of an environmentalist, but I feel that I'm 
sensitive to environmental concerns," said Ferguson, who is openly testy about 
such inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just that I want to balance them against economic concerns," he said. 
"After all, people aren't falling dead in the streets. People are living longer 
in America and California than ever in the history of mankind. People are 
healthier today than they've ever been. People are stronger today than they've 
ever been." 
</P>
<P>
Less defensive about her environmental transformation is Assemblywoman Doris 
Allen (R-Cypress), who readily admitted that she became an opponent of the 
Medfly eradication program only because of malathion spraying taking place in 
her 71st Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
"When your ox is gored, it becomes very real," Allen said. "You see the 
reactions and the upset of the people in your district, and you begin to 
experience their fear and their questions, and you experience them from your 
neighbors and your family. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll admit," she said, "malathion is an eye-opener." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly illuminating, she said, was her 74-year-old mother being sprayed 
with the pesticide when she ran out of her Lakewood home a couple of weeks ago 
to look at the low-flying state helicopters. Allen's own home has been sprayed, 
after which the lawmaker washed off her patio furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, according to voting records, Allen opposed key pesticide and toxic 
control measures, including one that would have outlawed the use of 15 
agricultural sprays linked with cancer. In years past, Allen has voted against 
measures that would keep pesticides out of drinking water, toxic dumps away 
from schools and require farmers to post warnings in pesticide-treated fields. 
</P>
<P>
Within the past several weeks, however, Allen has appeared at a bipartisan 
press conference to question the eradication program, which had existed for 10 
years. She has signed a Feb. 26 letter of protest to Gov. George Deukmejian and 
introduced legislation that would put up administrative hurdles -- including 
72-hour advance notice and multilingual public notices -- before more spraying 
could be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) has also reacted to the malathion 
spraying in his district, and on his home, with a bill calling on the state to 
spend $1 million extra to boost the production of sterile Medflies, from 
100,000 to 250,000 flies a week. The extra supply of sterile insects, used to 
reduce the number of the pest's offspring, would allow the state to stop 
spraying altogether, Pringle said. 
</P>
<P>
Would Pringle have considered such a measure if his district had not been 
sprayed? 
</P>
<P>
"Probably not," he said. "My job is to represent the people who elected me 
here, and there was a tremendous outcry from the residents in my community, 
expressing concern over the aerial spraying." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) admitted that he has made mistakes in past 
anti-environmental votes. The former Anaheim mayor is locked in a bitter 
statewide race for lieutenant governor with Bergeson, who opened her campaign 
by trying to portray herself as more sympathetic than Seymour to environmental 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, records show that Seymour voted against laws making oil companies pay 
for oil spills, as well as setting aside $2.5 million to aid in those cleanups. 
Bergeson voted for both. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, both were ranked about even by the Conservation League for 
their environmental votes, and Bergeson last week drew a dart from the group 
for her vote to kill a bill to require local governments to make sure there are

Seymour said that his change of heart has been a gradual process accelerated by 
the March, 1989, Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska, and 
that the Huntington Beach spill reinforced his heightened concern. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour last month introduced two measures, one of which requires state 
officials to oversee the unloading of environmentally hazardous cargo in 
coastal waters. Bergeson's oil spill measure would require that only 
double-hulled tankers be allowed in state waters. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, if I had known that Valdez would have occurred and the American 
Trader would have occurred, then back in 1984 and 1985 I would have been voting 
differently," Seymour said. 
</P>
<P>
"We make mistakes. I make mistakes. I'm not going to always be right. 
Therefore, to expect one to never change a position on an issue . . . is too 
much to ask." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Robert C. Frazee (R-Carlsbad), whose district includes San Clemente 
and parts of Dana Point, said it is a "fair analysis" that malathion spraying 
and the Huntington Beach spill have changed -- at least to some degree -- the 
hearts of the Orange County delegation. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, he said, the recent environmental episodes remind him of how old-time 
local officials used to decide on where to put up stop signs around town: "The 
old rule is you don't put up a stop sign unless you have a serious accident and 
someone is killed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that," Frazee said, "but that seems to be the rule in our 
society, in our government."

GREEN POWER: ENVIRONMENTAL RECORDS OF O.C. LEGISLATORS 
</P>
<P>
Orange County legislators' votes on selected environmental bills between 1984 
and 1989. An F designates a vote in favor of a position taken by environmental 
groups, while an O designates an opposing vote. A " -- " means the legislators 
declined to vote, were absent or had not yet been elected. 
</P>
<P>
The percentages reflect the number of times each legislator has voted in 
agreement with environmental groups on 210 key environmental issues over the 
last six years.

GOP PANEL BACKS O.C. LEGISLATORS' ANTI-GAY STANDS

<P>
After three years of rejection, a coalition of conservative Orange County 
legislators succeeded Saturday in passing two anti-gay resolutions through a 
state Republican Party committee. 
</P>
<P>
Former opponents of the measures, including a gay Republican organization, said 
a week of delicate negotiations before the state party's semiannual convention 
led to a compromise that essentially made the resolutions meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
But the authors, Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) and Assemblyman Gil 
Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), were claiming victory Saturday and predicting that 
the measures would be passed today at a meeting of all the delegates attending 
the convention. 
</P>
<P>
"We now have an expression of the state party on the issue, and the state party 
speaks for all of us," Dannemeyer said. "Anybody who wants to be a leader in 
our party should recognize that traditional family values have been encouraged 
and that's the direction he or she should be going." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer's resolution would prohibit the granting of "special privileges" to 
individuals or groups based on sexual preference. It is aimed at ordinances 
prohibiting discrimination against homosexuals in areas such as employment, 
housing and education. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson's resolution is intended to prevent the party from recognizing 
organizations based on sexual preference, such as the Log Cabin Club, a gay 
Republican organization. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) and the Rev. Louis Sheldon, head of 
Orange County's Traditional Values Coalition, also attended the committee 
meeting and supported the resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
Under the negotiated agreement, Ferguson removed a specific reference to the 
Log Cabin Club from his resolution. As a result, Orange County's Log Cabin 
President Frank Richiazzi said he does not believe the measure will affect his 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer agreed to remove graphic descriptions of sex acts that had been 
included in his measure. Richiazzi said he is not opposed to a ban on "special 
privileges" because gays only request that they be treated equally in the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nobody in the gay community that is asking for special privileges," 
Richiazzi said. "It's meaningless now. This small little Bible-thumping group 
is in a fantasy world." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's vote came after more than a week of negotiations aimed at heading 
off the divisive battles the resolutions have sparked at past conventions 
between party conservatives and moderates. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations included state party Chairman Frank Visco, staff members from 
gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson's campaign, the Orange County authors of 
the resolutions and the Log Cabin Club. 
</P>
<P>
During the previous convention, "there were people who thought . . . things got 
out of hand," said Otto Bos, campaign manager for Wilson. "We kind of worked to 
encourage them to talk to each other." 
</P>
<P>
After that convention, held last September in Anaheim, party leaders, including 
national GOP Chairman Lee Atwater, condemned the resolutions, saying they were 
in conflict with the party's intention to be inclusive and reach out to 
minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Visco said he now supports the resolutions. "The Republican Party is 
an all-inclusive party within the guidelines of practicality," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Visco said gays are welcome in the Republican Party but he does not believe a 
group organized on sexual preference should be a chartered Republican club. 
</P>
<P>
Party leaders were also concerned that the resolutions might aggravate Wilson's 
difficult relationship with the conservative wing of the party, since he has 
supported the Log Cabin Club. 
</P>
<P>
Bos said he does not believe the resolutions will cause any problems because 
they were approved by all sides. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a good feeling about what happened," Bos said. "There are going to be 
differences from time to time, but we're all Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan warned, however, that if Wilson criticizes the resolutions, "he will 
increase the percentage against him . . . and that's something for the 
Democrats to feed off."

PLANE-NOISE STUDY AT EL TORO CREATES LAND-USE DOUBTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A new study projecting future aircraft noise around the U.S. Marine Corps Air 
Station at El Toro is causing concern among public officials and developers who 
fear that the findings could upset land-use plans and halt nearby home 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Both the city of Irvine and the Irvine Co. have expressed reservations about 
the Marine Corps draft study, which is the first step in a formal reassessment 
of the El Toro base's impact on surrounding communities when the base replaces 
older aircraft with new fighters. 
</P>
<P>
Under Orange County and Irvine land-use policies, the so-called "noise 
contours" around airports and military air bases limit the development of 
homes, and to a lesser extent, offices and stores. The noise lines look much 
like elevation contours on a topographic map. 
</P>
<P>
Military and city officials have three noise-measurement plans before them: one 
measuring aircraft decibel levels the current way, the second measuring noise 
on an "average day," including holidays and weekends, and a third that measures 
noise on an "average busy-day" basis. The latter would register more noise and 
the "average-day" measurement would gauge the least, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to be able to rely on (noise) lines that hold up over time," said 
Irvine Mayor Larry Agran. "This has been the continuing problem with the Marine 
Corps. . . . The rules of the game seem to change every five years, based upon 
new studies. . . . That kind of development renders the whole planning process 
somewhat of a joke." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Thomas, an Irvine Co. vice president, said, "What up until now has been a 
certainty, with respect to the (planning) interests of the city and the company 
and the Marine Corps, now potentially has been made more uncertain. . . . It's 
the prospect of that uncertainty . . . that has gotten our attention." 
</P>
<P>
City and county officials have said the new noise contours could prevent 
residential development of property owned by the Irvine Company west of the 
so-called El Toro "Y" freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
It also could affect some development in the Aliso Viejo and Foothill Ranch 
communities, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Col. Jack Wagner, community plans and liaison officer for Marine Corps 
bases in California and Arizona, said the new noise lines will have little 
impact on nearby neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"They're planting a lot of bum soup in the community," Wagner said. "The number 
of (aircraft) operations is declining. The noise lines are shrinking more than 
they are increasing. . . . What's the complaint?" 
</P>
<P>
The noise study is the first step in a formal process to reassess the 
relationship between the air station and the surrounding residential and 
commercial areas. Known as the Air Installations Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ) 
program, the reassessment should be completed by September. 
</P>
<P>
Both Orange County and Irvine will base many planning decisions on the noise 
study, which will include the new noise contours. Although the Marine Corps 
provides the data, the planning decisions are the responsibility of the local 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
The Marines undertook the new study because they are retiring older A-4 and A-6 
attack aircraft and replacing them with the modern F/A-18 Hornet fighters, 
which have different noise characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
The draft noise study projects 65,187 annual jet operations at El Toro 
beginning in 1992. The figure includes landings, takeoffs and overhead 
maneuvers. A 1981 study projected up to 72,000 annual flight operations for the 
foreseeable future, but flight operations dipped significantly in 1986, 1987 
and 1988 as the Marines retired older aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Local officials are uncertain about what the study will mean for land-use 
planning largely because of a new wrinkle introduced by Navy officials here. 
The Marine Corps is officially a part of the Department of the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
The complication is a new, alternative noise measurement included in the El 
Toro draft study that differs from measurements used in previous studies. 
Current noise contours and the land-use plans based on them were last 
established in the 1981 study. 
</P>
<P>
The previous studies based noise contours on aircraft landings, takeoffs and 
training maneuvers conducted during an "average day" of operation. Because very 
few flights are scheduled at El Toro on weekends and holidays, the average-day 
noise level is significantly lower than the level on a normal operating day. 
</P>
<P>
While the new study also includes an average-day measurement, it adds an 
additional measurement of noise levels on an "average busy day," when normal 
operations are being conducted. Contours for the average busy day are, by 
definition, larger and include more area than contours for the average day. 
</P>
<P>
The key line on the new noise maps is one that measures the area where the 
aircraft noise level is 65 decibels or greater. County and city planning 
policies, based on state noise standards, generally prohibit residential 
development within the 65-decibel line, and restrict commercial development in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
The average-day 65-decibel line in the new study actually encompasses a smaller 
area than the existing 65-decibel line set in 1981, Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the 65-decibel line for the average busy day in most areas lies well 
outside the existing boundary, raising the possibility that local governments 
would restrict development in a larger area than previously planned. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the real noise impact on the ground to the people who are hearing the 
noise?" asked Alan Zusman, the Navy's noise-measurement study manager. Zusman 
said the Navy's goal is to come up with the best available measurement of the 
impact of aircraft noise on the people who hear it in surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
The "average-day" measurement may underestimate that actual impact, Zusman 
said. "So we decided another way to do it was look at the average busy day, 
when a station is in normal operation." 
</P>
<P>
But Wagner at El Toro said the Marines will recommend that local governments 
adopt the more lenient average-day standard because that was the method used in 
the last noise study. 
</P>
<P>
"The previous AICUZ (noise-measurement) studies have served the city and the 
county and the Marine Corps well for land-use planning purposes for over 15 
years. Let's not change techniques if they've served us well," Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to compare the average day with the average day," he said. "Do not 
look at . . . average busy day. The final line will be based on average day, it 
will not be based on average busy day." 
</P>
<P>
The head of Orange County's Environmental Management Agency, Michael M. Ruan, 
said the county probably will go along with the Marines' recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
But Irvine officials are not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at it from a health and safety standpoint," said Peter Hersh, 
Irvine's manager of planning services. "We want to see if we are justified in 
distinguishing one (standard) versus the other. We want to get all our facts 
together before we decide which one we are going to base our land-use policy 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Added Mayor Agran: "What I'm looking for is a legitimate methodology that bears 
some relationship to the real world, and in the real world, people are 
frightened, they are annoyed and they are pointing the finger politically when 
there is an unacceptable level of noise. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Marines are telling us the (noise) footprint should be larger, they may 
well be right. But what we have to do is get from them reliable figures . . . 
that will hold up, not just for a year or two, but forever, for our planning 
process." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to raising concerns about the two different noise standards, 
officials have suggested that the Marine Corps noise study, which is based on a 
computer model, ignores test data indicating that the noise levels actually are 
much lower than the computer has projected. 
</P>
<P>
EL TORO AIRCRAFT NOISE CONTOURS 
</P>
<P>
A Marine Corps study projects areas to be affected by noise when the El Toro 
base replaces older attack aircraft with modern F/A-18 Hornet fighters with 
different noise characteristics.

LEARNING NEW WAYS IN SILENCE;

IMMIGRATION: SOME ALIENS FLEE ONE WORLD OF SILENCE FOR ANOTHER. CATHOLIC

<P>
Jose Villanueva is at the head of the class, telling other students about 
voting for President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"You keep learning sign language and you keep going to school and the President 
keeps on giving speeches, and then you can go vote," he signs to the other 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, you get nervous," he says, making his knees tremble. "But you can work 
that out. You learn." 
</P>
<P>
The students are deaf immigrants applying for amnesty. They are living in a 
silent world here as much as in the nations of origin, and they came without 
the skills and tools that could help them learn a new system. Many in Sister 
Josie Gonzales' classes at Holy Family Roman Catholic Cathedral in Orange have 
never been to any kind of school. 
</P>
<P>
"They're survivors," says Gonzales, a teacher and the service coordinator for 
Catholic Charities' Deaf Outreach program. "But they're more than survivors. 
They came to this country not knowing the language and not being able to 
vocalize their thoughts. The spirit that they have, and the motivation, is not 
just to become citizens or residents. It is one to learn and to move ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Catholic Charities had received phone calls and inquiries about 
deaf immigrants who were trying to complete their requirements for amnesty, the 
immigration law that grants legal residency to aliens who can prove that they 
lived here since 1982. So last year, the organization began what is believed to 
be the first English-language and civics classes for deaf amnesty students in 
Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
Amnesty applicants are required to attend 40 hours of English-language 
instruction and civics classes before they can apply for permanent legal 
residency. But no one had ever set up a class that would serve deaf applicants, 
Gonzales says. 
</P>
<P>
Educators say the requirements have opened the world of education to many 
immigrants who often had little schooling in their own country. But in the case 
of Gonzales' students, the effects have been even more dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the nun's students were the only deaf people in their families or in 
their rural communities, where there was no one trained to teach them. 
</P>
<P>
Each of these students somehow made it through life, working to support 
themselves, sneaking across the border as illegal aliens, then also making a 
living in a foreign country, relying on a system of communication that each 
made up as he or she went along. 
</P>
<P>
But now they are learning to express complicated thoughts by using universal 
symbols and sign language. They are discovering themselves and other deaf 
people, Gonzales says, because the classes have placed them in a network of 
services for deaf people, including a Sunday Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Lupe Cardenas, 33, who works for a landscaping company in Garden Grove, says: 
"I had never heard of classes for the deaf until I applied for amnesty." 
</P>
<P>
The class began last year, and it has grown steadily. There are about 15 
students who attend regularly, but Gonzales says she is sure that there are 
many more deaf immigrants who would probably take advantage of the classes if 
they knew about them. 
</P>
<P>
One day last week, the class consisted of the round-faced Cardenas and Angel 
Olivarez of Santa Ana, who almost always wears a Lakers cap and who does boat 
maintenance and repairs. There was also Villanueva and his wife, Lina -- both 
of them deaf -- who often bring their year-old baby to class with them. Lina 
signs constantly, "chattering" on and on about how quickly her baby is learning 
to walk. 
</P>
<P>
There is Juan Rodriguez of Santa Ana, a carpenter, and Margarito Flores of 
Santa Ana, who wears his long hair in a ponytail and is a laborer at one of the 
few farms remaining in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is Rodolfo Perez of Santa Ana, the oldest of the group, who is a 
janitor at the church and is proud of the business cards his employers had 
printed up for him. 
</P>
<P>
They meet from 5 to 9 p.m. twice a week and spend part of their time sitting at 
school desks facing a blackboard as Gonzales or one of the nun's students leads 
them in reading and writing lessons that include civics discussions. 
</P>
<P>
During another part of the class, they stand in front of a large screen that 
depicts a typical town setting, including a supermarket, a car repair shop, a 
bank, a post office, a park, homes and a hospital. The students take turns 
describing scenes for each other, or asking each other how they would mail a 
letter, or what role a fire department plays in a city, so that they can 
practice their signing, Gonzales says. 
</P>
<P>
"If the car is thirsty, you put in the gas," Rodriguez signs to the class as he 
points to a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
The exercise also evokes discussions about the nuances of living in America. 
For example, a picture of the police car led to a talk about seat belt 
requirements, drunk-driving laws and driver's licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Olivarez says he does not have a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
"And you've been driving all these years?" Gonzales asks in astonishment. 
"We're going to have to learn, so you can take the test. Come on, everybody, 
show him your licenses. Here in California you need one. 
</P>
<P>
"If the policeman stops you, Angel, he's going to ask, 'Where's your license?' 
You'll get a $75 ticket, and they could put you in jail," she tells Olivarez, 
and one of the students shows him a brochure with a drawing of someone behind 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll go and pick up a book, and you and I will work together," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of them, except Perez, have licenses and their own cars and have been 
driving for years. 
</P>
<P>
The talk turns to sirens when they see an ambulance on the screen. "I keep my 
eye on that rear-view mirror, and I'm real careful and alert, and if I see that 
ambulance, I just pull over," Cardenas says. 
</P>
<P>
"I can hear it just a tiny bit," Flores says. "When I see other people pulling 
over, then I pull over too." 
</P>
<P>
Someone brings up the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane's speed records, and an 
argument begins over whether it flew across the United States from Los Angeles 
to Washington or around the world, as Cardenas insists. (It flew across the 
United States.) 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you what," Gonzales signs to Cardenas. "I will find the newspaper 
stories, and Monday I'll bring them in to show you." 
</P>
<P>
"But you know I can't read," he says quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The nun assures him that she will tell him what the articles say. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great plane," Cardenas continues about the Blackbird, which he refers 
to by touching his own black hair. "It was huge and it didn't use much gas. It 
flew around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Most of these students say they could barely read or write -- in English or in 
Spanish -- when they began taking Gonzales' class. Now they are working on 
writing the names of the months, their addresses and the words for common 
objects, such as money order or store. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm understanding more and more now," Cardenas says. "But my writing's not 
what I want it to be yet." 
</P>
<P>
"Before, in Guadalajara, my reading was not very good," Perez says. "Now it's 
improving and improving. I don't want to let it go now. I don't want it to 
escape me." 
</P>

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK : TRACKING OF CRANSTON NO EASY JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There I was, cursing silently, squeezed in the back seat of a four-wheel-drive 
following a similar vehicle carrying Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) through the 
rugged terrain of Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's Jeep was picking up speed, hurdling over ditches and racing up 
hills. It was all my driver could do to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
It was a windy Friday afternoon three months ago. Cranston had suddenly 
announced plans to come to Laguna Beach and tour Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
No one was quite sure why. Laguna Canyon was certainly a hot issue locally 
because of widespread opposition to Irvine Co. plans to build a massive housing 
development there. But no one had asked for Cranston's help in resolving the 
dispute and many found it strange that a U.S. senator would make a special trip 
to Laguna Beach just to see the proposed site of an obscure housing 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, however, had been getting a lot of bad press concerning his role in 
the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan scandal. What better way to give his tarnished 
image a boost, some city officials remarked, than by showing constituents that 
issues close to home were dear to his heart? 
</P>
<P>
One Laguna Beach city official put it more bluntly. "This visit comes to you 
courtesy of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan," he said. Yet Cranston aides insisted 
the purpose of the visit was to get a firsthand look at the Laguna Laurel 
project area because the senator might lobby for federal funds to buy the 
canyon and save it from development. Cranston had proposed a bill 10 years 
earlier that would have made the Irvine Coast a national park, aides said, 
proof of his genuine interest in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Few were convinced. But a week later, Cranston arrived in town. There was a 
brief press conference, then Irvine Co. officials brought around two Jeeps to 
drive us all to the Laguna Laurel project area, which is only accessible by 
dirt roads. 
</P>
<P>
I went to climb into the Jeep in which Cranston was riding and was met by a 
surly Irvine Co. official who told me the press van was in the back. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't understand," I said, struggling to maintain my composure. "That's 
just like asking the press to ride in the baggage compartment on Air Force 
One." 
</P>
<P>
Another reporter rushed to my defense, saying it would be a violation of 
open-meeting laws if the press were not allowed to ride in Cranston's Jeep. 
</P>
<P>
Tough luck. We could either ride in the press Jeep or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Irvine Co. officials said, it wouldn't be so bad. Cranston's Jeep 
would pull over along the way to give reporters the opportunity to ask all the 
questions they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
So, reluctantly, two other reporters and I piled into the second Jeep. Our 
driver followed the first vehicle, which turned off windy Laguna Canyon Road 
and bounded ahead along a bumpy dirt road. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before I realized something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"When are they going to stop?" I asked, feeling my blood begin to boil. 
</P>
<P>
"Soon," snapped an Irvine Co. official. 
</P>
<P>
But after 20 minutes, it was clear that the Jeep with the VIPs had no intention 
of stopping. Instead, it picked up speed. Our driver honked his horn for them 
to stop. They ignored it. 
</P>
<P>
When we finally came to a near stop, I opened my door and bolted, heading 
straight for Cranston's Jeep. I stuck my face through the passenger window 
where the senator was securely buckled, trapped as I had been just moments 
before, and shot him a flurry of questions. 
</P>
<P>
Several aides rushed to his rescue. The group finally agreed to get out and 
hold a two-minute question-and-answer session. But it wasn't long before a 
Cranston aide was barking that we had to get back because the senator was 
running late for his next engagement. 
</P>
<P>
After a whirlwind tour of a part of the canyon that did not include any of the 
areas where the controversial homes are supposed to be built, Cranston and his 
aides headed off to their next appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"Wait a minute," I asked then-Councilwoman Lida Lenney. "He didn't even look at 
the part where they're talking about building the homes." 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty incredible, isn't it?" Lenney said. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, three months later, no one from the city has heard a peep 
from Cranston's office about getting federal money to buy the canyon.

PROTECTION RACKET HELPS BLACKBURN AT LINE

<TEXT>
<P>
Tammy Blackburn sat on the Brea-Olinda High School bench and was as relaxed as 
she could be. She knew she was protected. 
</P>
<P>
With 1.3 seconds left and the score tied at 46, Blackburn was waiting to shoot 
the front end of a one-and-one. There wasn't much on the line, just 
Brea-Olinda's 54-game winning streak and a trip to the Oakland Coliseum for the 
Division III state championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes had called timeout in an attempt to "ice" Blackburn. But it wasn't 
going to work. 
</P>
<P>
Blackburn was protected. 
</P>
<P>
As she came to the bench, Brea-Olinda Coach Mark Trakh handed her a basketball. 
She had clutched the ball through the entire timeout and still had it when she 
walked onto the court to shoot the free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Blackburn tossed the ball to the sideline, took the game ball from the 
official and made the first free throw to give Brea-Olinda a 47-46 victory in 
the Southern California Regional Division III girls' basketball final. 
</P>
<P>
"During the timeout, coach gave me the ball and said, 'You're protected, the 
ball will go in,' " Blackburn said. "He also told me it was my senior year and 
I wasn't going to miss." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Blackburn already had missed as a senior. In the finals of the 
Tournament of Champions, Blackburn missed two free throws with no time left 
against Los Angeles Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Lady Cats won that game in double overtime, Blackburn could not 
forget the failure. "Tammy told me after the Washington game that if she was 
ever in that situation again, the shot was going down," Trakh said. "She got 
her chance today." 
</P>
<P>
She not only got it, but she also created it. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Cats had routed the Sea Kings, 50-33, in the Southern Section 3-AA 
championship game. However, Palos Verdes controlled much of Saturday's game and 
led through most of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda finally tied the score, 46-46, on two free throws by Allison Bickel 
with 26.4 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings then attempted to get the ball to Lisa Humphreys, who had scored 
15 of Palos Verdes' 19 second-half points. They succeeded, but only briefly. 
</P>
<P>
Once Humphreys touched the ball, Blackburn applied pressure and appeared to 
knock the ball out of her hands. In the scramble for the loose ball, Blackburn 
was fouled. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't remember knocking the ball free," Blackburn said. "Maybe I did. 
I just saw the ball on the ground and went for it. I was surprised that the ref 
called the foul. It had been such a physical game. I guess the ref was just in 
good position to see the foul." 
</P>
<P>
Blackburn's free throws made up for a rather dismal performance in the second 
half. She had eight points in the first half, but made only one of eight shots 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem was the Sea Kings' two-three zone, which had been extended 
to take away the outside shooting of Blackburn and Aimee McDaniel. 
</P>

"I'm glad I had a chance to win the game after those bricks I was throwing up 
in the second half," Blackburn said. "The Washington game was in the back of my 
mind. When I made the first free throw, I felt like I was going to cry."

<P>
Before the Knopf Field scoreboard at Tustin High School finally stopped 
recording the damage, the shadows were long and 25 runners had crossed the 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
But that didn't mean Mater Dei and Foothill high schools had stopped playing. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes before sunset Saturday, Mater Dei relief pitcher Jim Doyle got 
the final out in a 23-5 victory in the championship game of the Newport-Tustin 
baseball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The game was all but over by the top of the fourth when Mater Dei reserve third 
baseman Brian Hudson hit a pinch-hit grand slam over the left-field fence. At 
least, it was over as far as the scoreboard was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson's homer gave Mater Dei a 20-5 lead, but the Knopf Field scoreboard can't 
display numbers higher than 19. 
</P>
<P>
So for the rest of the game, the score was a mystery to any fan without a 
scorebook. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei (5-1) had 21 hits, and all but four Monarchs got at least one hit in 
the three-hour game. 
</P>
<P>
Designated hitter Keith Frankel, the Monarchs' No. 8 batter, had a three-run 
double in the first, then added a two-run single an inning later. 
</P>
<P>
Right fielder Jim Cook, Mater Dei's ninth hitter, had two RBI triples. 
</P>
<P>
By the fourth inning, Frankel, Cook and most of Mater Dei's other starters had 
taken the rest of the afternoon off. But Hudson and the Monarch reserves didn't 
make things any easier for Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have a little too much power for them right now," Mater Dei Coach Bob 
Ickes said. "We're fortunate that we have a lot of very good athletes." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei relievers Doyle, Eleazar Elizondo and Mike Ferletic held Foothill to 
two hits. Ferletic (1-0) got the victory in relief of starter Dave Gonzales, 
who gave up a two-out grand slam to Foothill's Kent Donnelly after walking the 
bases loaded in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill, which managed only four hits Saturday, fell to 3-1. Right-hander John 
Scardino (1-1) took the loss for the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
In consolation games: 
</P>
<P>
Tustin 15, Mission Viejo 2 -- Dan Baker pitched a three-hitter and struck out 
seven in six innings and Shawn Green had two hits, scored twice and had two 
RBIs to lead Tustin (3-1). Dan Taylor had three hits and one RBI. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Valley 6, Costa Mesa 0 -- Scott Crosby struck nine in five innings 
and got offensive support from Michael Murtaugh, who doubled, singled, scored 
and had two RBIs. Ron Sanchez doubled, singled, had a RBI and a run scored for 
Santa Ana Valley (2-2). 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana 10, Saddleback 2 -- Host Santa Ana was led by Adam Chavez, who struck 
out four in four innings. Octavio Medina and Victor Frank each had three hits 
for Santa Ana (3-1). John Morales had two hits and three RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza 10, Newport Harbor 0 -- Brad Aubuchon had three hits, a single, 
double and triple, had three RBIs and scored twice to lead Esperanza. Dan 
Reddington had two RBIs and scored two runs. Esperanza is 2-2.

Generosity is fine, but Ocean View High School Coach Steve Barrett said his 
team went a little far in a 9-3 loss to Lakewood in the Loara baseball 
tournament championship game Saturday at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave free passes, we gave free runs and we're probably going to give 
everyone in the stands free steak dinners when we're done," Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood (5-0), ranked No. 1 nationally by USA Today, won the tournament for 
the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Due largely to Ocean View (4-1) mistakes, the Lancers took a 3-1 lead after two 
innings on just one hit. Further, Ocean View pitchers walked six batters, and 
five of them scored. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood's Jeff Marsh singled to open the first inning and moved to third when 
Ocean View pitcher Eric Schaff overthrew first base on a pickoff attempts. He 
scored on a fielder's choice by David Reeser. 
</P>
<P>
In the Lancers' second inning, Chris Miller and John Haberland walked with one 
out and advanced on a double steal. Schaff got the second out on a strikeout, 
but followed with a wild pitch to score Miller. Haberland also scored when 
Ocean View catcher Kevin Bill's throw to the plate, in an attempt to get 
Miller, was wild. 
</P>
<P>
"We never gave ourselves a chance tonight," said Barrett, whose team was making 
its first appearance in the championship game. "We came out and kind of 
self-destructed. We've got a couple of youngsters and I think they were a 
little nervous." 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood extended the lead with four runs in the fourth and two in the fifth. 
Miller, who scored three runs and stole two bases, accounted for the 
fifth-inning runs with a home run. 
</P>
<P>
Neither team used its top starter because Barrett and Lakewood Coach Spud 
O'Neil were working around the pitching limitation rule in use in the Southern 
Section for the first time this season. The rule states that, from Monday to 
Saturday of each week, a team may not use a pitcher more than 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett said he would have preferred to start Jim Gwaltney (1-0), who relieved 
Schaff (0-1) in the fourth inning. O'Neil's top pitchers are Reeser, 11-1 last 
season, and Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Lakewood's Ryan Hornbeck filled in well. He won his first start of the 
season by allowing just four hits, including Gilbert Gonzales' solo homer in 
the sixth, and striking out four in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
"We have superb pitching," said O'Neil, whose team allowed 11 runs in five 
tournament games. "They're all good athletes and can play in the field, too."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: CAL STATE FULLERTON COACH JOHN SNEED SAYS SERIES OF 
INCIDENTS LED TO BENCHING OF CEDRIC CEBALLOS.

Cedric Ceballos' four-minute benching at the start of a Cal State Fullerton 
basketball game Wednesday came five days after campus police were called to a 
dispute involving Ceballos and his girlfriend on campus, a Cal State University 
Police Department spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
Campus police were called to Fullerton's student housing at about 8 p.m. March 
2 where Ceballos and his girlfriend were involved in a loud argument, Sgt. Sam 
Summerlin said. There were no criminal complaints filed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Coach John Sneed had been criticized for being insensitive when 
Ceballos said he was benched for arriving late for practice Tuesday after 
attending the memorial service for his friend Hank Gathers, the Loyola 
Marymount star who died Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Sneed said Saturday that Ceballos was disciplined for a series of incidents and 
not only for being late to practice. 
</P>
<P>
Sneed said he had given tardiness as the reason for the action because it was 
an easy explanation to reporters, but he was embarrassed by reports critical of 
the benching. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never punish Cedric for going to a funeral," he said. "Cedric was 
supposed to take care of some personal things as his mother and I requested, 
and didn't." 
</P>
<P>
A Fullerton source said Ceballos was supposed to meet with campus police 
Tuesday but did not. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos, who was watching the semifinal games of the Big West Conference 
tournament at Long Beach Arena Saturday, said he did not know anything about 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what's going on," he said. "Maybe it's a different situation or 
somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos, the leading scorer in the Big West Conference, did not start the 
tournament game against UC Irvine Wednesday, but played most of the game in a 
Fullerton victory. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton concluded its season Friday with a 13-16 record after a loss to 
third-ranked Nevada Las Vegas.

ONLY THE LAWYERS ARE SURE TO WIN IN LINCOLN WARS; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: TWENTY-FOUR LAWSUITS AND NEARLY AS MANY INVESTIGATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO 
KEEP PROSECUTORS AND LAWYERS BUSY FOR YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
A courtroom full of lawyers had gathered for their weekly meeting in Phoenix a 
few months ago to go over some legal matters in the bankruptcy of American 
Continental Corp., parent of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald E. Warnicke, a Phoenix lawyer who was appointed an examiner in 
bankruptcy, contended that the way the company's chairman, Charles H. Keating 
Jr., was spending money to fight federal thrift regulators, there soon would be 
no money left for creditors. 
</P>
<P>
The accusation prompted U.S. District Judge Richard M. Bilby to warn the 
lawyers about the vast amount of litigation and investigations involving 
Lincoln, which could become the biggest thrift bailout in history with a 
$2-billion bill to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hate for this case's epitaph five years from now to be that the public 
lost, the regulators lost, American Continental lost, the creditors lost, Mr. 
Keating lost -- but the lawyers got rich," Judge Bilby said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the lawyers are doing well. Lincoln is arguably the most investigated 
financial institution in the nation's history. To date, at least seven state 
and federal agencies are investigating possible criminal wrongdoing. In 
addition, small investors and government authorities have filed at least 24 
major civil lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages from Keating and 
his top executives. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine anyone being more investigated," said Donald Gaffney, a 
Phoenix lawyer for a bankruptcy committee of unsecured American Continental 
creditors. "Other than the CIA, everyone's investigating Lincoln." 
</P>
<P>
The web of investigations and lawsuits will take years to untangle. Much of the 
effort may be for naught. Keating and his corporate executives have claimed in 
court documents that they're out of money, making any recovery of claims 
against them questionable. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental, which has worked with more than 75 law firms in the last 
few years, is paying its army of lawyers more than $1 million a month to battle 
regulators and other litigants and to bring the company out of bankruptcy. And 
the government is estimated to be spending twice that on its hired hands in an 
all-out war to put Keating and his cohorts totally out of business and behind 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the spending appears to be unnecessary because of duplicative efforts. 
Federal authorities, for instance, are not sharing information with state 
investigators or other parties who are on the same side. And state authorities, 
Gaffney said, appear to be going over the same ground that federal 
investigators and others already have covered. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and American Continental have helped run up the bills by filing several 
lawsuits against regulators as well. The company has challenged the federal 
seizure of Lincoln last year. U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin has been 
hearing testimony over the last several months. 
</P>
<P>
While the Lincoln collapse is a boon to lawyers, Gaffney quips that the big 
winners are paper manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
A document depository was created in Phoenix to maintain the originals of all 
documents filed by American Continental, Lincoln, federal regulators, several 
accounting firms and others. The depository has more than 20 million pages of 
documents in some 10,000 boxes, which, if set end to end, would create a Great 
Wall of Lincoln -- a foot-wide, foot-high mound of paper stretching for nearly 
four miles. 
</P>
<P>
"You can read from now until your demise and still not read everything," said 
John Quinn of Los Angeles, a lawyer for Keating and his family. "I've never 
seen anything like this." 
</P>
<P>
But there's a reason for all the paper, beyond the fact that fraud cases 
typically include a large amount of documents. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the financial scandal of our age," said William S. Lerach of San 
Diego, one of the lawyers in 17 lawsuits brought by small investors who bought 
American Continental debt securities. 
</P>
<P>
David B. Gold of San Francisco, another plaintiffs lawyer, points out that the 
litigation involves more than just the loss of $250 million to more than 23,000 
debt holders. The civil suits include charges of improper political pressure by 
Keating and his company. 
</P>
<P>
"This case goes to the very essence of the way our government works," Gold 
said. "If political pressure is going to be put on our regulators, it 
undermines the function of government." 
</P>
<P>
Before American Continental filed for bankruptcy last April 13 and regulators 
seized Lincoln the next day, Keating wielded great influence among politicians. 
He and his family and business executives, as well as his company, contributed 
more than $1.7 million to about three dozen state and federal politicians or 
their causes. And he frequently called officeholders to express his views on 
thrift law regulation. 
</P>
<P>
His group spent most of its money -- more than $1.3 million -- on five 
influential U.S. senators, including Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who raised more 
than $900,000 from the Keating group, mostly for voter registration groups the 
senator supported. 
</P>
<P>
When Keating had trouble with regulators over an unusually long federal audit 
of Lincoln in early 1987, he called on the five senators to help end the audit. 
The Keating Five, as they now are known, held two meetings with regulators, who 
have since claimed the senators pressured them and sought to make a deal for 
Keating. 
</P>
<P>
The senators have vehemently denied applying pressure or seeking any deal and 
have called for some of the investigations that now are part of the litigation 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, for instance, had asked the General Accounting Office to look into 
ways to get money back to the American Continental debt holders but the GAO 
declined to act, citing ongoing litigation elsewhere. Some Keating Five 
senators, such as John McCain (R-Ariz.), were among those who asked the Federal 
Elections Commission to look into possible campaign law violations on the part 
of himself and the other senators. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the Senate Ethics Committee is probing their contacts with federal 
thrift regulators on behalf of Lincoln. The senators have vigorously defended 
their actions in that forum. 
</P>
<P>
The pending litigation and investigations come from three groups: federal 
authorities, state agencies and creditors, primarily debt holders. Most of the 
small investors were part of a group that bought the biggest chunk of debt 
securities, or bonds -- nearly $200 million worth -- at Lincoln's 29 Southern 
California branches. 
</P>
<P>
James J. Feder of Los Angeles, a lawyer for American Continental, admits that 
his client has its share of legal problems, particularly the $250 million in 
class-action claims from bondholders. But he said the case does not rival the 
problems caused by some previous bank failures. 
</P>
<P>
"While that's a lot of money, it's not in the range or involves the complexity 
of cases like Penn Square or Continental Illinois," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Penn Square National Bank in Oklahoma City, Okla., failed in 1982 because of 
bad energy loans, causing millions of dollars of losses at other banks and 
resulting in criminal convictions for fraud. Continental Illinois National Bank 
in Chicago was the first major federal bailout of a bank as regulators put $4.5 
billion into it in 1984 and took an ownership position, which they subsequently 
sold. Neither bank action, however, carried the political overtones involved in 
the Lincoln case. 
</P>
<P>
The list of pending lawsuits against Keating and others includes a recent civil 
action filed by the California Department of Corporations, a suit many lawyers 
involved in the massive amount of litigation say is inadequate and 
hypocritical. Bondholders have sued the agency in some of their class-action 
suits, accusing it of wrongly approving the bond sales when there was clear 
evidence that American Continental couldn't repay the debt. 
</P>
<P>
"The Corporations Department sued three people who claim not to have any money 
at all and almost negligently failed to go after those who are just as culpable 
and have money," said Joseph W. Cotchett of Burlingame, another bondholder 
lawyer. "They manifest a complete lack of understanding of what happened." 
</P>
<P>
The bondholders are looking to recover from the professionals -- accountants 
and lawyers -- who advised Keating, as well as from insurance carriers for 
Keating, his lawyers and his accountants. 
</P>
<P>
The list of pending investigations against Keating and his executives includes 
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner's call for a special state grand jury 
to investigate the possibility of criminal wrongdoing, an action some lawyers 
think might help but others call superfluous and politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, acting as a special state attorney general, may be able to move faster 
than federal authorities and secure a conviction that could help the bondholder 
cases move more quickly, Cotchett said. But plaintiffs lawyer David B. Gold 
said the investigation covers the same area that federal officials are probing 
and charged that Reiner's only motivation is political. A Democrat, Reiner is 
running for state attorney general and wants to reach as high as possible into 
Deukmejian's Republican Administration for wrongdoers, Gold claims. Reiner 
denies the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, invited to join the state 
investigation, said he declined because his office has "too many cases to spend 
our resources on without duplicating what another agency has done." He gave the 
federal task force two county investigators and will supply staff lawyers if 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi, a Republican, said his decision was nonpartisan and based on the best 
interests of the investigation, the victims and the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, a Democrat who is running for governor, has 
been criticized for playing politics with the Lincoln case. Caught between his 
dual role of defending state officials and prosecuting state fraud cases, he 
did nothing through last summer, then appeared to flip-flop between 
investigating Lincoln and defending the state. 
</P>
<P>
In December, he decided to pass the criminal investigation off to Reiner and 
Sacramento County Dist. Atty. Steve White, a former Van de Kamp aide. The 
attorney general also decided to launch a separate civil investigation while 
defending the state against bondholder litigation. This litigation alleged 
negligence on the part of the Corporations Department for approving the debt 
sales when the agency knew American Continental could not repay the debt. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, Van de Kamp decided that state officials had to get their own 
lawyers, at state expense, because his office would have a conflict of interest 
in investigating securities improprieties while representing the state agency 
that may have wrongly approved the securities sales. 
</P>
<P>
Corporations Commissioner Christine Bender was fuming. She charged that Van de 
Kamp was abandoning his clients and that he already had an attorney-client 
relationship with them. Worse, she said, he was withdrawing when the state had 
a vital interest in any statements she made in upcoming depositions in the 
bondholder litigation because her comments could bind the state and make it 
liable. She termed his conflicts argument a "thin excuse." 
</P>
<P>
Bondholder lawyers said she "stonewalled" the questioning at her deposition on 
Thursday, giving them little information. Bender could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, bondholder lawyers have been jockeying among themselves for positions 
of leadership, positions that will pay them huge sums should the lawsuits 
recover the money they expect. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, it's going to result in one of the largest class-action 
recoveries in history," bondholder lawyer Lerach said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers such as American Continental's James Feder said they've never 
seen such infighting among plaintiffs lawyers for the job of lead counsel. 
Cotchett's attempt in December to freeze Keating's assets and revelations that 
Lerach hosted a fund-raiser for Cranston in December were really efforts to 
take control of the cases, defense lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
Cotchett, Lerach and other plaintiffs lawyers, though, say they've been working 
together amazingly well -- so well, Lerach said, that he and Cotchett were 
recently named co-lead counsel in the federal litigation in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But now Gold, the San Francisco lawyer, has filed a bondholder suit in federal 
court in Phoenix and has asked for a consolidation of cases there in what most 
plaintiffs and defense lawyers see as a bold attempt to join as co-lead 
counsel. The Lerach-Cotchett group filed papers opposing any move out of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Gold is not going to be co-lead counsel," Lerach said. "He filed his suit late 
and he went by himself to a jurisdiction where no one else filed. The odds of 
the cases being transferred out of Los Angeles are very remote." 
</P>
<P>
LINCOLN'S LEGACY OF LEGAL ACTION 
</P>
<P>
MAJOR PENDING LITIGATION 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's Parent Looks for Safe Harbor: American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, 
unable to sell Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, files a bankruptcy 
petition April 13, 1989, to protect itself from creditors while it tries to 
reorganize under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws. Federal regulators 
seize Lincoln the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators Seek Funds in Bankruptcy: Federal regulators file a claim against 
American Continental in Bankruptcy Court to recover losses at Lincoln that were 
allegedly caused by the parent firm. Regulators predict the bailout of Lincoln 
will amount to $2 billion, the costliest thrift rescue ever. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental Fights Back: Lincoln's parent files three lawsuits against 
regulators. One challenges the takeover of Lincoln. A second seeks $500 million 
for wrongful taking of property. And a third seeks $200 million for leaking 
confidential financial information -- much of it allegedly erroneous -- that 
harmed the S&amp;L. The company dropped the leaks suit last week under court 
pressure to curtail legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Bondholders Seek $250 Million: About 23,000 holders of five different issues of 
American Continental's unrated, uninsured debt securities file 17 lawsuits in 
state and federal courts in California and in federal court in Arizona. They 
allege fraud, misrepresentation and racketeering against American Continental 
executives and their lawyers and accountants. The biggest block of plaintiffs, 
nearly 22,000, bought almost $200 million of the lowest-grade securities mostly 
at Lincoln's 29 Southern California branches. 
</P>
<P>
RTC Files Racketeering Suit: The Resolution Trust Corp., which manages failed 
savings and loans, files suit accusing seven American Continental executives of 
racketeering and 20 directors, officers and spouses of fraud. The suit seeks 
$1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Insurers Sue to Abandon Keating: Three insurers covering American Continental 
Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. and other officers and directors for their 
corporate actions refuse to defend the executives and sue for a court order 
saying they don't have to pay defense costs or any judgments. Keating sues a 
fourth insurer for refusing to honor a similar policy. 
</P>
<P>
State Dept. of Corporations Sues: Christine W. Bender, who as the agency's 
commissioner initially approved the Lincoln bond sales, files a state 
securities fraud suit seeking restitution for the 22,000 debt holders and an 
injunction against three American Continental executives to prevent further 
violations of securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
Pontchartrain Investor Sues Insiders: An investor in the Pontchartrain Hotel 
Limited Partnership, which owned the downtown hotel, contends in his suit filed 
in federal court in Detroit that American Continental insiders are liable for 
securities fraud in their marketing of partnership shares. Insiders held a 
majority interest in the hotel, which the partnership bought from Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
PENDING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
</P>
<P>
Joint Task Force Launches Probe: A joint task force including the FBI, the U.S. 
attorney's office and the Orange County district attorney's office is working 
with a federal grand jury in Los Angeles on three separate probes. They are 
investigating allegations of general bank fraud, securities violations and 
illegal political contributions. 
</P>
<P>
D.A. Asks for Special Grand Jury: Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, 
acting for state Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, wins Superior Court authorization 
to empanel a special state grand jury to investigate primarily any wrongdoing 
in the sale of debt securities in Lincoln's branches. He expects to have jurors 
in place by mid-April and to complete his investigation in six to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
Corporations Dept. Seeks D.A. Probes: The state agency asks the district 
attorneys in Los Angeles and Orange counties to investigate possible criminal 
violations of state securities laws. The request is handled as part of on-going 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
SEC Continues to Investigate: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has 
been investigating American Continental for more than three years on a variety 
of disclosure and other securities law matters. Long quiet, the investigation 
has heated up recently with new subpoenas issued to Keating and his family. The 
SEC is empowered to bring either criminal charges or civil lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
PENDING CIVIL INVESTIGATIONS 
</P>
<P>
FEC Checks Possible Election Law Wrongs: After revelations about Keating's 
support of three dozen politicians, particularly five U.S. senators, the 
Federal Elections Commission launches a probe into possible election law 
violations, including allegations that Keating contributed funds to campaigns 
in return for favors for Lincoln. The five senators, including Sen. Alan 
Cranston (D-Calif.), deny such claims. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. House Committee Broadens Scope: The U.S. House Banking, Finance and Urban 
Affairs Committee, after making a series of disclosures about Lincoln over the 
last five months, turns its investigators loose on other ailing thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Thrift Regulators Follow Up Investigations: The Office of Thrift Supervision, 
which regulates savings and loans, and the RTC, which filed the federal 
racketeering suit, continue to investigate additional allegations of fraud, 
regulatory violations and other wrongdoing against the same defendants and new 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp Initiates State Action: Van de Kamp, after naming Reiner and the 
Sacramento County district attorney in December as special attorneys general to 
probe possible criminal violations, decides to look at possible civil 
wrongdoing, primarily in connection with the sale of debt securities at Lincoln 
branches. 
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcy Examiner Looks for Fraud: A court-appointed examiner in the 
bankruptcy cases of American Continental and 11 Lincoln subsidiaries is looking 
for fraud and mismanagement of the companies. 
</P>
<P>
Creditors Hire Special Investigator: The unsecured creditors committee, formed 
in American Continental's bankruptcy, brings in a special investigator and 
audit team to uncover the causes of the bankruptcy. The committee is made up 
mostly of debt holders. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Committee to Wind Up Probe: Three days of hearings and a massive 
amount of documents are being boiled down into a report from a subcommittee of 
the Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee. The investigation was sparked by 
the committee's chairman, Pat Johnston, (D-Stockton). 
</P>
<P>
RELATED INVESTIGATIONS 
</P>
<P>
Senate Ethics Probe Targets Five: The five U.S. senators who intervened with 
federal thrift regulators on behalf of Keating look to the Senate Select 
Committee on Ethics to clear them of any ethical blame for their questioning of 
regulatory treatment of Lincoln in April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Accountants Face License Action: The state Board of Accountancy is looking into 
the work of individual accountants at the firms of Arthur Young &amp; Co. (now 
Ernst &amp; Young), Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and Touche, Ross &amp; Co. (now 
Deloitte &amp; Touche). Debt holders and others claim accountants 
misrepresented American Continental's financial condition. The board can 
recommend sanctions including revocation of licenses. 
</P>
<P>
State Bar Reviews Conduct of 3 Lawyers: The State Bar of California starts an 
investigation into the ethical conduct of Gov. Deukmejian's chief fund-raiser, 
Karl M. Samuelian, and two others, Franklin Tom and Christine W. Bender. 
Samuelian and Tom represented American Continental in winning Corporations 
Department approval for the sale of debt securities. Bender, who came from the 
same law firm, was the agency's commissioner when she approved the last debt 
offering in May, 1988.

ROCKET FIRM CHANGES COURSE AFTER LAUNCH PAD BLAST; 
</P>
<P>
SPACE: A FAULTY FUEL VALVE CAUSED AMROC'S FIRST ROCKET TO BURN ON THE LAUNCH 
PAD. THE COMPANY NOW JUST WANTS TO SELL ROCKET ENGINES IN A BUSINESS IN WHICH 
RELIABILITY IS EVERYTHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
American Rocket Co., a Camarillo concern whose first attempt to launch a 
commercial rocket failed when the 58-foot-tall craft burst into flames on the 
launch pad Oct. 5, has put off plans for a new rocket launch and will try 
instead to stay in business by selling rocket motors. 
</P>
<P>
But AMROC will have to convince potential customers, from aerospace giants like 
McDonnell Douglas to small private launch companies, that its motors are 
reliable, which might not be easy after the launch failure. 
</P>
<P>
"My gut feeling is they're going to have to recreate the credibility of that 
design," said one potential customer, former astronaut Donald K. (Deke) 
Slayton, who runs Space Services, a small Houston company that last year 
successfully launched a rocket made from an assortment of government missile 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
In the private commercial rocket business, according to Slayton, "The most 
important thing we have to sell is reliability. You can't afford to be 
perceived as not reliable." 
</P>
<P>
Since the rocket fire, AMROC has laid off about 50 of its 80 regular employees, 
said Paul Estey, AMROC's president. AMROC also let go about 40 people it hired 
temporarily for the launch. Estey said the company has enough money on hand for 
a year of development work on the engines. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall AMROC was intent on trying to jump into the new commercial rocket 
business. It spent $15 million to ready its first unmanned, suborbital launch 
attempt. But the launch attempt at Vandenberg Air Force Base never got off the 
ground. The rocket caught on fire, and its liquid oxygen tanks were punctured 
when the rocket toppled over. 
</P>
<P>
After the space shuttle Challenger accident, the federal government opened the 
way for private, commercial rocket launches. Since then three major companies 
-- McDonnell Douglas, Martin Marietta and General Dynamics -- that have been 
building missiles for decades have lined up business to launch commercial 
satellites into space. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a handful of smaller companies, such as AMROC and Space Services, 
have tried to develop their own rockets to launch smaller payloads into space, 
such as medical experiments or small satellites. In April, Orbital Sciences, 
based in Arlington, Va., plans to launch a rocket carried aloft by a B-52 
bomber. 
</P>
<P>
Last month Estey replaced interim AMROC president James Bennett, who took over 
the company after the death of AMROC founder George Koopman in an auto accident 
last July. Estey was AMROC's vice president of engineering. 
</P>
<P>
One reason AMROC is putting off another launch attempt is the high cost. Just 
renting a pad and tracking services on launch day last October cost AMROC 
$100,000. And Estey said the company believes it will have an easier time 
finding customers, such as the major rocket companies and its smaller rivals, 
to buy AMROC's motors than it would have finding companies with payloads to put 
into space. 
</P>
<P>
Estey said his company's rocket failed due to a faulty liquid oxygen valve that 
led to the fire that consumed the rocket. "It's a relatively easy problem to 
fix, and people realize that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But AMROC has yet to complete any rocket motor sales. 
</P>
<P>
The AMROC motor burns a combination of liquid oxygen and a solid fuel that is 
like tire rubber. It burns only when sprayed with the liquid oxygen from a 
separate tank. Because the rubber fuel doesn't tend to burn by itself, the 
motors can be assembled and shipped without the extraordinary precautions that 
are necessary for some highly combustible fuels. Estey said the engines, made 
to order, could cost from several hundred thousand to several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to looking for sales to private rocket launch companies, AMROC also 
plans to bid on a contract to develop a hybrid engine for NASA. The space 
agency may eventually replace the solid-fuel boosters on the space shuttle with 
hybrid solid and liquid fuel motors. The NASA contract wouldn't call for work 
until October, at the earliest, and could range in size from $3 million to $16 
million, Estey said. 
</P>
<P>
But for small concerns, the commercial rocket business is anything but stable. 
Last November, Slayton's company suffered a failure in its second rocket 
launch. The rocket had to be blown up because the payload separated from the 
motor too early, due to a guidance system problem. 
</P>
<P>
The failure hasn't prevented Space Services from scheduling another launch in 
May. "But if we'd had a motor failure on that flight, then we would end up 
having to go back to the drawing board," Slayton said.

RETIRED SENIORS DRAW ON YEARS OF EXPERIENCE TO OFFER BUSINESS ADVICE; 
</P>
<P>
TRAINING: THE VOLUNTEER CORPS OFFERS ONE-ON-ONE COUNSELING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE 
NOVICES IN BUSINESS OR NEED HELP TO ADVANCE.

<P>
In an age of multibillion-dollar buyouts and mergers, an unassuming army of 
13,000 is teaching Americans to think small. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the volunteer Senior Corps of Retired Executives draw on decades of 
business experience as they offer free, one-on-one counseling to people who are 
just getting started in small business or who need help moving ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we have attained hard-won skills in our business lives, this is the best 
way we can volunteer," said Ann Oxley, a SCORE member from Ft. Wayne, Ind., who 
volunteered for a year as the group's marketing director here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's refreshing to see that you can use what you learned from all the bumps 
and slashes you got going through the business jungle." 
</P>
<P>
SCORE, sponsored by the Small Business Administration, has 13,000 active 
members, 80% retirees and 20% active business people. Those still in business 
generally help put on workshops that SCORE offers its clients for a small fee. 
With more than 750 chapters and satellite groups nationwide, SCORE has served 
more than 3 million people over the past 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Just recently, SCORE and the SBA sent out a notice seeking information on 
retirees with language skills that might be useful as Eastern European nations 
open to the West. Volunteers may be asked to help translate publications or 
speak to foreign delegations. 
</P>
<P>
John Daniels, executive director and one of only seven full-time paid 
employees, said SCORE's impact is hard to measure in dollars and cents, but 
success stories abound. 
</P>
<P>
In Hostetter, Pa., SCORE counselor Lou Sabers helped the struggling volunteer 
fire department cut its loan payments in half by obtaining a special 2% 
emergency loan from the state. "They told us they were on the brink of 
bankruptcy," Sabers said. 
</P>
<P>
In Independence, Mo., Norman Westheimer, a 78-year-old former vice president of 
the former GEM Corp., helped Brenda Louderback revamp her ad strategy for 
Diessl Jewelers and analyze her profit-and-loss statements. "I only wish I had 
studied harder and followed more closely the advice and input that was so 
generously offered," Louderback said. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, 76-year-old David Gilbert -- with 30 years in the import-export 
business -- helped brothers Jim and Joseph Hadzicki turn their prototype giant 
kite into Revolution Kites, which racked up $500,000 in sales its first year. 
"It was nice to have somebody who had been through this kind of stuff before 
who could recommend the proper steps," said Jim Hadzicki. 
</P>
<P>
Other less-evident successes are found in the ranks of people who decide not to 
go into business or to postpone it after SCORE members lay out the demands of 
running a small business and the potential pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of SCORE clients in the Midwest found that 27% had canceled or delayed 
plans to go into business after contacting the organization, in some cases 
preserving savings that otherwise might have been lost to failure. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people who think about taking their retirement money and opening up a 
pizza parlor right across the street from a Pizza Hut," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have prevented many, many casualties, which is good for the American 
economy as well as for the individual ego. It's crushing to fail," Oxley said.

HIGH-TECH LONG JOHNS SEWING UP NICHE IN SPORTSWEAR PROFIT MARGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Long johns just ain't what they used to be. And that's good news for the 
consumer. 
</P>
<P>
Today there is a wide variety of high-tech replacements for the old scratchy, 
bulky, shrunken underwear. 
</P>
<P>
Choices range from silk to polypropylene, from such trademarked synthetic 
fabrics as Lifa, Thermax and Capilene to cotton, wool and synthetic blends. 
</P>
<P>
"Underwear is a specialized product today, versus what it used to be," says Jim 
Jennings, product manager for Lands' End, a direct-mail retailer based in 
Dodgeville, Wis. "You really have to determine the activity before you buy." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Sweeney of Patagonia, a sportswear manufacturer in Ventura, agrees: 
"People used to say, underwear is underwear. But then we said, why don't we 
make it perform? And then we said, why don't we make it fun?" 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney defines fun as thermals in such non-traditional colors as neon orange 
with navy trim or emerald with purple trim. 
</P>
<P>
Thermal underwear used to be made of 100% cotton, with a small amount made of 
100% wool, says Tom Armstrong, product research and testing manager for L.L. 
Bean in Freeport, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
But an explosion of synthetic fabrics changed that for the better about 10 
years ago, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a trend toward more man-made fibers," says Bob Blanchard, 
president of National Knitwear Manufacturers Assn. in Morristown, N.J., which 
tracks national wholesale thermal sales. 
</P>
<P>
"It is now well over half the market, where 10 years ago it would have been at 
least 80% all-cotton." 
</P>
<P>
"Cotton alone is useless in a really cold environment," says Armstrong, who 
oversees a textile lab and 400 field testers around the world. "Its high 
absorbency is its downfall. In essence, it freezes if you stop in winter. 
</P>
<P>
"Wool is great. The old expeditions to the Arctic or the Himalayas relied on 
wool. But some people find them itchy, and they don't dry out very well." 
</P>
<P>
What thermal underwear a person chooses today depends on what they do and how 
cold it's going to get around them. 
</P>
<P>
For cross-country skiers, lumberjacks and backpackers -- or anyone who will 
work up a sweat in the cold -- Armstrong recommends polypropylene because of 
its ability to wick moisture away from the body, keeping wearers warm and dry. 
</P>
<P>
But ice fishers, stadium fans, vendors and some hunters -- or anyone who spends 
several hours still in the cold -- should get heavier, double-ply 
cotton-wool-synthetic blended thermals, Armstrong says. 
</P>
<P>
Even such sports names as Nike and Patagonia have entered the previously 
unglamorous field. 
</P>
<P>
People who want to wear the same thermals as space shuttle astronauts can 
choose Capilene underwear by Patagonia, in three different weights. Nike also 
offers three different weights of thermals in its All Conditions Gear line. 
</P>
<P>
But what weight to choose? 
</P>
<P>
"If you're standing still in the cold -- like a ski-race judge -- buy 
expedition-weight," Sweeney says. "If you're cross-country skiing, buy 
mid-weight. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're wearing it under your clothes, buy lightweight." 
</P>
<P>
Those who do a variety of outdoor activities are a retailer's dream. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are both passive and active, you can't use just one set of underwear," 
Jennings says. 
</P>
<P>
In the natural fibers, silk is now king, chosen for its soft, light texture. 
</P>
<P>
"Silk is the top of the line," Jennings says. "People use it to sleep in, for 
layering, anywhere you don't want to be encumbered." 
</P>
<P>
If the bulk and itch of earlier thermals are gone, what about the tight fit? It 
seems that shrinkage problems may be a thing of the past, as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Normal shrinkage is 5% to 7%," Armstrong says. "But we build in that size 
buffer. If you put it on right from the box, it would be a little big. Our 
people fit the garment so it fits correctly after washing."

If the pressures of the '90s are bearing down, keep heart. In Alaska, McCarthy 
Wilderness B&amp;B welcomes vacationers in search of peace. (Just don't expect 
luxury.) No television, no electricity, no telephones, no running water, 
outdoor plumbing. Mail is delivered by bush plane once a week. But Bob and 
Babbie Jacobs promise vacationers the opportunity to turn back the clock 100 
years at Wrangell/St. Elias National Park (about eight hours by car outside 
Anchorage). Guests bathe in a wood-fired log sauna. Communication with the 
outside world is via a message system played daily over a radio station. (In 
this northern wilderness, the sun never sets between June and August.) The 
McCarthy B&amp;B accommodates 10 persons in a log cabin. Other rooms overlook a 
creek. Rates: $55 double B&amp;B. McCarthy is accessible by road from

On the Wild Side: My idea of a vacation is to download the stress circuits. I 
don't want to be up at dawn boarding a bus or scaling a mountain. Give me a 
peaceful beach. Or a grassy meadow with the voice of the wind humming through a 
forest. But my particular formula doesn't satisfy everyone. A growing number of 
vacationers are seeking the active life. Which is why Rock Creek Pack Station 
in Bishop, Calif., is busy taking reservations. The idea at Rock Creek is to 
track wild mustangs. A Western adventure in the Inyo National Forest. "All you 
need is a bed roll," says Dave Dohnel of Rock Creek. "We supply the rest." At 
Rock Creek, vacationers work as ranch hands and join annual horse drives 
(spring and fall). Other Rock Creek wranglers lead trail rides and pack trips 
during summer months into John Muir, Golden Trout and Ansel Adams Wildernesses, 
Yosemite and Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Parks.

Dohnel at (619) 872-8331.

London Hosts: If you're traveling to London, you might want to check out The 
Bulldog Club. This is an upscale B&amp;B group. Accommodations on quiet 
streets, but within minutes of London's Underground and bus stops. Shops, 
restaurants nearby. Guest rooms feature flowers, color TV, coffee/tea, bottled 
waters. Copies of the London Times delivered daily. Guests of The Bulldog Club 
are given a packet of information, including a map pinpointing homes, parks.

antique markets.

The importance of writers in the success of a television series was especially 
significant this season. 
</P>
<P>
The highly successful "Roseanne" was a hit because of scripts that would be 
hard for anyone to harm. We also had "Sister Kate," which had all the elements 
for success except the most important one: Stephanie Beacham was superb as the 
nun with the caustic tongue and the children were adorable, but the plots were 
often stupid and contrived. Then you have the best of both worlds -- Candice 
Bergen in "Murphy Brown."

I watched ABC's "America's Funniest Home Videos" for the first and last time 
Feb. 18. One almost can pardon adoring parents for thinking it's funny for 
"junior" to pour dirt onto their pet Doberman's eyes, but not the judgment of 
the show's producers for considering it to be a hilarious situation.

Bob Hope's typically predictable and inane NBC "special" hit new lows Feb. 17 
with his sexist and stupid monologue on women in combat. 
</P>
<P>
No way could you make me believe an audience would laugh at such sexist drivel. 
The other low was the sketch on "We Care Cemetery." Did Bob even consider how 
this would sound to a person who has experienced the recent (or not so recent) 
death of a family member or friend? He went for cheap laughs but unfortunately 
was not funny.

The Diary of Anne Frank (Cinemax Sunday at 11 a.m.): If you haven't seen this 
1959 George Stevens film, you will be delighted to discover that it stands the 
test of time as one of the most poignant of all coming-of-age stories. (2:30) 
</P>
<P>
Rain Man (HBO Sunday at 10 p.m.): It was Dustin Hoffman who won the Oscar for 
his performance as an autistic middle-aged man, but it's Tom Cruise, as his 
much-younger brother who carries the 1988 picture as a wheeler-dealer 
transformed during a cross-country trip with Hoffman. (2:20) 
</P>
<P>
The Quiet Man (TBS Thursday at 7 p.m.): John Ford's glorious 1952 romantic 
comedy is set in Ireland and stars John Wayne as a champion Irish-American 
boxer returning to his birthplace and beguiled by fiery Maureen O'Hara, whose 
red-haired beauty was perfect for Technicolor. (2:30) 
</P>
<P>
M (Channel 28 Friday at 11:10 p.m.): Fritz Lang's 1931 masterpiece stars Peter 
Lorre as a tormented, compulsive child killer who becomes the target of an 
underworld fed up with being hounded by the police. The film is a triumph of 
psychological suspense and a landmark in the innovative use of sound. (2:00)

The Diary of Anne Frank (Cinemax, Sunday at 11 a.m.). If you haven't seen the 
1959 George Stevens film, you will be delighted to discover that it stands the 
test of time magnificently as one of the most poignant of all coming of age 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
Willie and Phil (KTLA, Monday at 3:30 a.m.). Paul Mazursky's sunny and gentle 
1980 variation on Truffaut's "Jules and Jim" is one of the director's 
lesser-known films, but it is no less than an affectionately satirical survey 
of the changing relationships between bright young people in the 70s. With 
Michael Ontkean, Ray Sharkey and Margot Kidder. 
</P>
<P>
I've Heard the Mermaids Singing (Bravo, Wednesday at 9 p.m.). Patrice Rozema's 
swift, witty and intimate 1987 debut feature reveals with humor and compassion 
the pitfalls in a working relationship between two radically different women.

ED GOES TO BAT FOR THE DODGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So, you think that all Mr. Ed can do is talk? 
</P>
<P>
You must be thinking of some other talking horse. This one has been a 
successful businessman, an artist and a spy. 
</P>
<P>
He can even teach the Los Angeles Dodgers a thing or two, which he does on "Mr. 
Ed" at 11 p.m. Friday on Nickelodeon. 
</P>
<P>
Ed, pretending he's Wilbur, calls Dodgers Coach Leo Durocher with tips to solve 
some of the team's batting problems. When the advice works, Wilbur is invited 
to a practice session to give him more. Ed, being the brains in the Post 
household, comes along to coach Wilbur coach the players. 
</P>
<P>
At Dodger Stadium, Ed shows once again that he's not all talk. By the end of 
practice, you'll be wishing Tommy Lasorda had him around last year. 
</P>
<P>
In another tie-in with a local sports team, Los Angeles Rams lineman Deacon 
Jones helps Peter discover that it's OK for macho men to sing on "The Brady 
Bunch" (1:35 p.m. Tuesday on TBS).

King Kong's favorite leading lady, Fay Wray, plays an ex-movie star in "Perry 
Mason" (9:05 a.m. Thursday on TBS). 
</P>
<P>
James Woods, now not exactly a stranger to misfit roles, is a freeway sniper on 
"Police Story" (midnight Monday on KCAL), in an episode from the mid-U70s. 
</P>
<P>
Before there was "Magnum, P.I.," there was Lance White for Tom Selleck. In one 
of the best-ever "Rockford Files" (noon Saturday on KCOP), three very different 
private eyes-the very human Jim Rockford, the practically perfect Lance White 
and the nerdy Fred Beamer-try to solve a murder at a private investigators' 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
Surfing footage from the documentary "The Endless Summer" was used in the

which the archvillain tries to become world surfing champ. 
</P>
<P>
"Mork Returns" to Milwaukee on "Happy Days" (9 a.m. Monday on KTLA), where he 
got his start on Earth. Richie shows him the value of human relationships by 
recalling moments with his family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
Hoss tries to prove that he did indeed see a "little green feller" at the 
Ponderosa on "Hoss and the Leprechauns," a fitting episode of "Bonanza" (noon 
Friday on KTLA) to be aired the day before St. Patrick's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Richie and Fonzie are the reluctant grooms in "Shotgun Wedding," which starts

STILL WALKING SILLY, AFTER 20 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE RHODES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's a mockery, blasphemous. Personally, I was offended." 
</P>
<P>
-Father Arnold Gonzalez, San Gabriel Mission, after a screening of "Monty 
Python's Life of Brian," 1979 
</P>
<P>
"You'll have to stop that now. It's getting altogether too silly." 
</P>
<P>
-Graham Chapman, in the midst of any number of Monty Python's Flying Circus 
episodes, 1969-1974 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes, it was a mockery and, certainly, it was quite silly. Gee, there 
wasn't even any cheese in the cheese shop, was there? What could be sillier 
than that? And, not only was it silly, but half the time they were making fun 
of "chat shows" and "Match of the Day" and all sorts of quirky little English 
things that we couldn't begin to understand. 
</P>
<P>
So, why is it that 20 years after the debut of "Monty Python's Flying Circus," 
the world still can't seem to get enough of twit competitions and the Ministry 
of Silly Walks? How is it that this pack of bratty English schoolboys (plus one 
renegade American) managed to become the first comedy troupe in history to 
attain rock star levels of fame and adulation? Has any other television program 
ever aired on both PBS and MTV? Who actually wrote "The Lumberjack Song"? And, 
by the way, can a sweater vest really keep you warm? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, we're not going to answer any of those questions here. Your only 
hope is to tune into Showtime this weekend when the pay cable channel premieres 
two one-hour specials celebrating the Pythons' 20th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
"Life of Python," featuring interviews with John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric 
Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin, debuts Friday at 10 p.m. "Twenty Years of 
Monty Python (Parrot Sketch Not Included)S debuts Saturday at 10 p.m. and 
features clips of memorable Python moments, including excerpts from some 
"Flying Circus" episodes filmed in Germany and never shown in America. 
</P>
<P>
The Saturday night special will also include the final appearance of Graham 
Chapman, who died of cancer last October. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman's death on Oct. 4 came just one day short of the 20th anniversary of 
the Python's debut show. Fellow Python Jones, remarking on the irony of it, was 
quoted as saying, "I thought it was in terribly bad taste for him to die when 
he did." 
</P>
<P>
It certainly was. Although Chapman's individual star never rose quite so high 
as those of Cleese, Palin or Idle, he was in many ways the soul of the troupe. 
His characters on stage tended to be straight men and authority 
figures-constables and professors. But offstage, Chapman was, by far, the most 
outrageous Python. 
</P>
<P>
Until he stopped drinking in the late 1970s, Chapman's alcoholic binges and 
barroom exploits put him in a league with the Who's Keith Moon, who also 
happened to be one of his best friends. He also described himself as 
Raggressively gay," a stance that delighted some and offended others. 
</P>
<P>
In his 1980 life story, "A Liar's Autobiography," Chapman wrote that after he'd 
appeared on a BBC interview program, a woman had written in to say that someone 
from Monty Python had appeared on television and admitted to being a 
homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
"Her handwriting became visibly angrier as she went on to say that persons like 
that should not be allowed to live," Chapman wrote. "Eric Idle wrote back to 
the lady saying that we (the Pythons) had found out which one it was and killed 
him. Curiously enough, we did the next series of shows without John Cleese. I 
wonder what she thought..." 
</P>
<P>
Chapman, like all the Pythons, had an academic background. He studied medicine 
at Cambridge, which is where he met Cleese, who was preparing for a career in 
law. Idle was also a Cambridge student (majoring in English). Jones and Palin 
attended Oxford (where Palin earned a history degree). Gilliam, the lone 
American, grew up in the San Fernando Valley and has a political science degree 
from Occidental College. None of this is particularly important, although it 
might help explain why they were always writing jokes about the Crimean War and 
Emmanuel Kant. 
</P>
<P>
This is the kind of thing that can be expected on Showtime this weekend. 
They'll show lots of clips, like of people exploding and Jones dressed like a 
fishwife and Gilliam's drawings of giant feet crushing strange things. Maybe 
someone will dress like the Pope, except that he'll be wearing stockings and a 
garter belt. 
</P>
<P>
But that would be blasphemous, wouldn't it? A mockery. And silly. Very, very 
silly.

HUNG UP ON THE HULK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Please let Bill Bixby know that I think retiring the Incredible Hulk is a 
drastic mistake. 
</P>
<P>
I for one have missed the program immensely. It is the Superman type of program 
that everyone loves. It's good, clean, exciting entertainment, and I wish it 
was a weekly program again. If not weekly, then maybe quarterly episodes. 
Please advise Mr. Bixby of this, and maybe he can bring him back to life.

My family and I enjoyed the recent Bob Hope special. We especially enjoyed the 
comedic talent of Michael Crawford ("Phantom of the Opera"). 
</P>
<P>
It was nice to see him out from behind the mask and showing his flair for 
comedy. We hope to see more of the multitalented Crawford in the future.

KELSEY BREAKS THE "LAW" 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For me, "L.A. Law" is indisputably the high point of the viewing week. 
</P>
<P>
It rivals anything on PBS, which I usually watch. However, two recent programs 
focused on Ann Kelsey. She is a very jealous, hateful and spiteful person. I 
know that such people do exist; in fact, I had such a "boss lady" myself once. 
Some of the other workers referred to her as a "witch on wheels." I realize 
that the series always tries to get in some conflict by showing all kinds of 
people. However, it is just too painful to watch this greedy and spiteful 
character.

TV OF THE PUBLIC BY THE PUBLIC AND FOR THE PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a long time, the only time people watched or heard about public access 
television was when it became the subject of a national news story on TV. White 
Aryan Resistance leader Tom Metzger, a rebel with a cause, stirred up the press 
when he used the platform for electronic free speech to show his "Race and 
Reason" program. Porno magazine publisher Al Goldstein raised some eyebrows 
when he titillated New York with "Midnight Blue," a nude public access talk 
show. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Orange County producers of "Secret Passions," the 
nation's first homosexual soap opera, reportedly sent their program to local 
public access channels because it was the only arena where they believed they 
could find air time. 
</P>
<P>
But community programmers insist that such controversial programming is no 
longer the norm. Public access viewing audiences are expanding because the 
producers are getting more sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
Public access is a permanent fixture in roughly 2,000 of the 9,010 cable 
systems in the United States, including Copley/Colony Cablevision in Orange 
County. The service is part of the franchise agreements that city and county 
governments arrange with cable companies. 
</P>
<P>
With public access, anyone can be a producer. 
</P>
<P>
"The normal guy who sits down at home in front of his television set can relate 
to us," said Omar White, a direct-mail advertiser and public access producer in 
Costa Mesa. The 37-year-old spends most of his spare time producing "Fish 
Report," a half-hour cable program for local fisherman. In one episode, White 
went shark fishing off the Newport Beach coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Public access is kind of a nuts-and-bolts approach to television," White said. 
"You learn how to balance production budgets, schedule shoots, write scripts. 
It brings television down to the community level. I'm not some guy from New 
York who shows up in a box on the TV screen. I go to the grocery market in town 
and people recognize me." 
</P>
<P>
"The main advantage of public access is the freedom," Sarah Kuhn of Costa Mesa 
said. "I'm able to do whatever topics interest me." The 55-year-old 
telemarketer produces "People, Places and Things," a magazine show that deals 
with sensitive topics such as AIDS, battered women, drunk driving, drama 
therapy and pregnancy options. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to think I'm offering something to the community," Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
Other producers with Copley/ Colony have created programs that range from a 
health show to community theater productions to a sort of "Two on the Town" for 
teen-agers produced by local Girl Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Communications Commission first mandated public access in 1972. 
Growth of public access in Southern California was slow to catch on, due in 
part to the abundance of local television programming and a scattered patchwork 
of cable TV systems. 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles there is no one public access center, no one entity that is 
responsible for creating a community image," said Sharon Ingraham, chairwoman 
of the National Federation of Local Cable Programmers in Washington, D.C. "In a 
smaller community, the public access channel may be the only form of local 
television available. It draws the community together because it's where people 
turn to for local news, issues and events." 
</P>
<P>
To help stimulate public access in Orange County, cities such as Costa Mesa and 
Cypress offer grants of up to several thousand dollars to producers to help 
ease production costs. 
</P>
<P>
"We obviously don't have the money to work with that the networks do, but then 
again, you don't have to deal with the politics," said Shelly Lash, a member of 
the Costa Mesa Cable Television Committee, which advises the City Council on 
grant funds. "There's no excuse for complaining what's on television when you 
can do your own show." 
</P>
<P>
The only qualifications to sign up for the free public access certification 
classes are that producers must be 18 years old, or accompanied by a certified 
adult producer, and live or work in the cable-service area. In addition, 
productions are exclusively for local programming and cannot be used for 
commercial purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Heaney and his twin brother Ryan of Cypress used part of their $500 grant 
to rent fog machines to produce a 20-minute "sight and sound fantasy" called 
"Touch the Horizon," a tale about the last girl on Earth following World War 
III. For the 23-year-old brothers' next production, a musical extravaganza 
called "Prowl," they are building sets, designing costumes, renting laser 
units, composing original music and featuring a cast of 30 dancers. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes down to it, not a whole lot of people are interested in doing 
production work," Roger Heaney said. "Sure, people look at it and it looks 
really glamorous. But when you go out and actually do it, you realize how much 
work producing a TV show really is."

'GUINEA PIG' FOR DRUG WAR OR A HARDENED CRIMINAL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN and CHARISSE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abandoned by his father as a boy, Richard Winrow had fathered three children of 
his own while still a teen-ager. He dropped out of high school and worked at 
low-wage jobs. By his 20th birthday, he had been arrested three times for 
dealing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Winrow entertained ambitions -- he would play for the Lakers or 
sell real estate, do something to pull himself, his seven siblings and, most of 
all, his mother out of the poverty that surrounded them in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In both his difficulties and his unrealized dreams, there was, sadly, little 
about Winrow to separate him from many other young black men who grow up in the 
tougher corners of the nation's big cities. One day last December, however, 
Richard Winrow's ordinary life took an extraordinary turn. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old became the first person in California and only the second 
nationally to be sentenced for possession of drugs under a tough new federal 
statute targeted at repeat offenders. Caught with 5 1/2 ounces of cocaine, a 
relatively small amount, Winrow was sentenced to life in prison without 
possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
"The sentence the judge gave me is beyond belief," Winrow said recently in his 
first interview since the sentencing. He was seated in a prison conference 
room, his hands and feet manacled, his voice strong. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm being used as a guinea pig for the war on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Winrow's case drew national attention, not only because of the severe sentence, 
but also because of the courtroom drama that preceded it last Dec. 6. The 
judge, 79-year-old David W. Williams, is a black man who grew up not far from 
Winrow's house. He delivered to Winrow a stern, stirring sermon about the 
devastation that drug dealers had brought to their common neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
In the three months since, Winrow has been confined to a tiny two-man cell on 
Terminal Island, awaiting transfer to a larger prison. He has read several 
Stephen King novels, placed daily collect calls to his mother and sought to 
control his anger. He still has trouble accepting the finality of his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was more or less a joke, because it wasn't real," he said, 
recalling his arrest two years ago at his mother's home in the Willowbrook 
neighborhood of Southeast Los Angeles. "I went from sleeping at 4 o'clock . . . 
to being in federal court at 8 o'clock faced with life in prison." 
</P>
<P>
Winrow's lawyer has filed an appeal of the mandatory sentencing law passed by 
Congress in 1988; the law sets sentences of life imprisonment without parole 
for people convicted for the third time of possessing 50 grams or more of crack 
cocaine or similar amounts of other drugs. It is the same sentence given to 
such notorious drug cartel kingpins as Carlos Lehder and Juan Matta 
Ballesteros. Legal experts, watching the case with interest, believe the 
challenge eventually will wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials, meanwhile, have laid plans to place posters of 
Winrow throughout his neighborhood, a warning to those who would follow his 
path. They remain enthusiastic that the sentencing law applied to Winrow will 
serve as a deterrent to the small-time dealers who they contend are crucial, if 
expendable, operatives for the narcotics cartels. 
</P>
<P>
Winrow believes he was selected as a test of the 1988 sentencing law -- he had 
been charged before the only other case prosecuted under the statute was filed 
-- because he fit the government's image of a drug-dealing gang member. 
</P>
<P>
"This kid is perfect," he said officials must have thought. "He's 21 years old, 
he's from a poor family, a black neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, on the very day Winrow was arrested, Justice Department officials had 
issued a press release saying they would go for the maximum sentence under the 
new law. Asked why Winrow had been chosen, Assistant U.S. Atty. John Gordon 
said, "The poor schmuck just happened to be unlucky that he is the first one." 
</P>
<P>
Winrow chose not to testify at his trial. He said he decided to grant an 
interview because "I thought it would be nice to let the public see who Richard 
Winrow is, that I'm not just a kid on the corner. . . . I'm very well-respected 
in my community." 
</P>
<P>
Winrow grew up in a crowded home without a father but full of love. "My mother 
raised eight children without any of them going to jail," Winrow said. "It was 
a struggle, but she made it relatively easy. I had food and clothes. She would 
take from herself to give to me." 
</P>
<P>
His neighborhood, one of small frame homes, has its share of drug dealers. But 
he said the drive-by shootings and random violence that plague some parts of 
South Los Angeles did not find their way to his block on East 118th Street. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice community. People don't walk around with blue rags hanging out of 
their pockets killing people," he said, referring to the typical image of a 
gang member. 
</P>
<P>
Winrow said most of his experiences in school were also good. During his years 
at Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School, Ralph J. Bunche Middle School and 
Alain Leroy Locke High School, "I had a nice experience learning about my black 
culture," he said, "and all the great things black people had done." 
</P>
<P>
Winrow was a good student but, like so many of his peers, he placed most of his 
hope in his athletic skills. He wanted to become a professional basketball 
player, specifically, a Los Angeles Laker. 
</P>
<P>
His grades dropped to a C average his junior year at Locke, and Winrow said it 
was in part because he'd become "a ladies' man . . . too young for all the 
venturing I got into." He volunteered the fact that by the age of 20 he had 
fathered three children by three women. 
</P>
<P>
Annie Coleman is the mother of his first child. They met at Mona Park. "He used 
to be up there playing baseball and we started talking," Coleman recalled in an 
interview at Winrow's mother's house. "He was nice. He was cute. We had fun." 
</P>
<P>
They started dating and she became pregnant. At the time, Winrow said, he was 
in the 11th grade at Locke High School. He was at a crossroads, torn between 
his dream of becoming a Laker -- one of his coaches described the 5-foot-11 
guard as a stand-out player with the potential to go further -- and the reality 
that he was a teen-age father. 
</P>
<P>
Winrow dropped out of school to work and take care of Annie and their baby, 
Jennifer, now 5. He took a job at Omeka Hair &amp; Nails, a Compton beauty 
salon, as an assistant to the owner. 
</P>
<P>
"I said I've got to be realistic and get out there and get a job . . . 
something that could give me and my daughter security for the rest of our 
lives," Winrow said. 
</P>
<P>
The mothers of his children say he was an attentive father. "It wasn't so much 
what he gave them," said LaTasha Kelly, 19, mother of Winrow's 2-year-old 
daughter, Jasmine. "It was how he treated them." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Winrow's mother, Lavern, his siblings and others who know him insist 
that he is not the hardened villain his sentence would suggest. Beatrice Smith 
Halliberton, assistant director of Mona Park for 27 years, said he "was never 
around the guys who would do dope. He was off to himself." Roberta Green, 
Winrow's grandmother, said he has "been through lots of hard times. He was 
raised up without a father. . . . Half of the time he had to scuffle for 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
Winrow said he knew that when he dropped out of school, any plans, including 
his basketball ambitions, became moot. "I wasn't depressed over it. It was just 
one of those dreams that got washed down the tubes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1986, Winrow began having problems with the law. He was arrested for 
possessing a small amount of cocaine. He was placed in a counseling program by 
a Municipal Court judge in Compton. Within the next year, Winrow was arrested 
twice more for possessing small amounts of crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1988, he pleaded guilty to charges stemming from all three of his 
arrests and was sentenced to six months in County Jail and three years of 
probation. Winrow served three months and was released. He contended in the 
interview that he had been harassed after his release by certain sheriff's 
deputies, prompting him to move to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
He lived away from his mother for about seven months, then returned home 
intending to take night classes at Locke to earn his general education degree. 
But those plans never got off the ground because Winrow was arrested again, 
just eight days after returning to the family home in Willowbrook. 
</P>
<P>
Marv Washington, an investigator for the Sheriff's Department, said an 
informant had tipped officers that Winrow and two other men were armed and 
dealing drugs. Washington also said that Winrow was a member of the Mona Park 
Crips, a gang he said has about 200 members and actively sells drugs in Los 
Angeles and several other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Just before dawn on Dec. 8, 1988, a team of sheriff's deputies and U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration agents, armed with a search warrant, stormed into 
Winrow's bedroom and arrested him. Affidavits submitted by the officers said 
they found 151 grams (5 1/2 ounces) of crack cocaine in plastic bags in his 
room. 
</P>
<P>
One officer said that when he went into the room, Winrow was sitting up in bed 
and said, "Don't shoot! The gun and the dope are right there!" pointing toward 
a bookshelf at the foot of his bed. 
</P>
<P>
"The narcotics were sitting on top of a triple-beam scale when the (deputies) 
found it," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Lisa Lench, who prosecuted the case. 
"There were 17 individually wrapped portions in a plastic wrap." 
</P>
<P>
The officers also found $3,209 in cash and a .357 magnum pistol. 
</P>
<P>
Winrow was convicted last August after a trial that lasted two days. He did not 
testify, and one condition of interviewing him was that he not be asked any 
questions about his arrest or the events surrounding it. 
</P>
<P>
Five months later, Winrow, wearing a blue prison uniform, went before Williams 
for sentencing in a small courtroom on the third floor of the federal 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, David Chesnoff of Las Vegas, a 34-year-old man with a penchant for 
double-breasted suits and a sardonic wit, had handled many cases involving much 
greater quantities of drugs. But none had consequences greater than those 
facing Winrow. 
</P>
<P>
Chesnoff made an impassioned plea to Williams to reject the congressional 
mandate that he impose a life sentence, asserting that the repeat offender law 
is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Chesnoff asserted that under the 1988 sentencing law, a person like Winrow, 
"hardly a big-time drug dealer, finds himself in a position where he can 
receive a harsher sentence than someone who assassinated the President of the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
Williams was not swayed. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress has gone out to battle the drug war, and this man is one of the 
enemies," Williams said of Winrow. 
</P>
<P>
The judge then delivered a long speech. He and Winrow, Williams said, have "one 
or two things in common. We are the same race and we come from the same 
neighborhood. I grew up on East 109th Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the neighborhood and I know the way that it has changed from early days 
to what it is now, and that is a battleground where men like this . . . are 
killing people off with their drugs and their violence. 
</P>
<P>
"And you say that this man is not connected with violence. He had a gun within 
arm's reach when the officers arrested him. This man is one of those that is 
causing black neighborhoods to be neighborhoods that you cannot live in, that 
you cannot safely walk down the streets on. And he has, along with his 
confederates, brought about unbearable conditions, and my people are the 
victims." 
</P>
<P>
Winrow responded softly that he was "sorry" he used drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a better way of knowing at the time that . . . they could take the 
rest of my life from me, I know I wouldn't have done it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Winrow challenged virtually every aspect of Williams' 
lecture. He said angrily that an old man who had left South Los Angeles 50 
years ago could not possibly understand what it is like to live there today. 
</P>
<P>
"He's out of touch, way out of touch," Winrow said. "It was just country, 
farmland, when he lived there. 
</P>
<P>
"Television portrays an All-American family with two station wagons," he 
continued. "Life is not like that in the (poor) black neighborhoods. It's a 
struggle for survival every day." 
</P>
<P>
He ridiculed the judge's statement that he was victimizing other black people. 
</P>
<P>
"The police," Winrow said, "come around and victimize us. They always portray a 
drug dealer as being black in the ghetto. Drugs come through airports, through 
shipping companies, underground. We don't go to Colombia or Australia to get 
it. It comes to us. The drugs come to the ghetto, then the police come knowing 
it's there. So, who are the victims?" 
</P>
<P>
Winrow acknowledged that he smoked crack cocaine, mixed into marijuana 
cigarettes, for a week in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just something the kids did," he said. "I knew it was wrong. Ever since 
I did it, I felt funny about myself, so I tried to make a change because 
athletes don't use drugs." He said he stopped using narcotics after his first 
arrest "because it really devastated my family. My mother was the worst. She 
cried and it made me feel like crying." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Wilson, the supervising county probation officer for Winrow's 
neighborhood, said Winrow had been tested twice monthly for drugs from the time 
he pleaded guilty in April, 1988, to October, 1988, shortly before he was 
arrested again. All the tests were negative. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials hope Winrow's case will serve as a deterrent. A 
gang-drug task force plans to plaster South-Central Los Angeles with posters 
bearing Winrow's picture and describing his sentence. An artist's rendering of 
the poster was being circulated among police officials last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make absolutely sure that people in neighborhoods terrorized by 
gang crack-dealing know that the law is out there and that the federal 
government is doing something," said Gordon, chief of the Los Angeles Gang Drug 
Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
DEA spokesman Ralph Lochridge said the stiff federal sentencing statute "is a 
tremendous tool for law enforcement," because street-level drug dealers have 
traditionally been more afraid of gang leaders than of the law. 
</P>
<P>
"When they have the possibility of life without parole," Lochridge said, "it's 
a real motivator for them to testify against gang leaders and sources of (drug) 
supply to the gangs. That's an element we haven't had." 
</P>
<P>
Winrow's experience on this issue seems to run counter to police expectations: 
His attorney said Winrow had declined to give investigators information about 
narcotics trafficking in exchange for a lighter sentence. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Winrow said the poster campaign "made me realize what I 
already knew. They wanted to use me as something they could show the world, 
that they're doing something about crack users, drug dealers." 
</P>
<P>
He said his former neighbors will just tear the posters down. 
</P>
<P>
Renee Scott, Winrow's 29-year-old sister, also contends that her brother's 
punishment will not curtail drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
"It ain't woke these boys up," Scott said, referring to the drug dealers her 
brother's punishment is supposed to frighten. "They're still doing the same 
thing. Look at all the laws they put up to stop drugs, and it ain't done 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Only time will tell if the harsh sentencing law really has a deterrent effect 
on drug dealing, time that Winrow has plenty of. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sitting in a cell all day long," he said. "Can't watch television, the 
news, nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Winrow, according to a prison spokesman, has been placed in the two-man 
isolation unit not because of anything he has done in custody, but because of 
the length of his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
He shares a 7-by-10-foot cell -- equipped with a bunk bed, sink and toilet -- 
with another man and said he is happy to have the company. At least that way he 
has someone to talk to, though he quickly added that he doesn't even know why 
his roommate is in prison. 
</P>
<P>
There is a routine -- breakfast between 6:30 and 7 a.m. lunch about 11:30, 
dinner by 5 p.m. The food is handed through a slot in the door. He is allowed 
out for exercise one hour a day, considerably less than the regular inmate 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Although he does not have as much contact with other inmates as he would like, 
Winrow said they have been supportive. He said he was comforted when a prison 
telephone operator told him on the phone that she thought he had been unfairly 
treated. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people do have a heart," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During the time he has been in prison, Winrow said he has read about 10 books 
by best-selling author King, including "Pet Sematary," and "The Shining." 
</P>
<P>
And in between, he takes time to phone his mother. Lavern Winrow said she waits 
for the calls. They come collect, lasting sometimes 30 minutes. Her phone bill 
runs up to $200 a month.

Winrow's mother refuses to accept the fact that he might never be free again. 
"I don't believe that. . . . They can't keep him in the penitentiary for life. 
(Even) murderers don't get life." 
</P>
<P>
At his insistence, Winrow has not seen any family members since his sentencing. 
"I won't let them come down because I'm not in the general (prison) population. 
I can't shower every day and look nice when they come see me." He is 
particularly embarrassed by his dark brown jumpsuit, which differs from other 
inmates' more attractive khaki outfits. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Winrow won't accept pictures or letters from family members, 
according to his former girlfriend, Coleman. She said she is not surprised that 
he won't accept visitors. "He has a lot of pride," she said in a recent 
interview. "If he didn't look right, he wouldn't leave the house." 
</P>

Williams said in a recent interview that he spent several sleepless nights 
before the sentencing hearing and that even today he finds himself thinking 
about his decision to put Winrow away for good. He said that he thinks the 
sentence was "unfair" but that his hands were tied by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Williams, a 35-year veteran of the bench, had ever handed 
down a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The judge acknowledges that life in South Los Angeles is tough, but he said 
Winrow was not forced to deal drugs. He said that other young black men, 
including himself, have found ways to better their lives without turning to 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked my way through college, scrubbing floors and polishing cuspidors," he 
recalled. "There's nothing much worse than polishing brass spittoons in the 
lobby of a bank." 
</P>
<P>
Winrow, maintaining his innocence, is at the beginning stages of what could be 
a long appeal process. Arguments before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court will be held 
later this year or next year. 
</P>
<P>
Chesnoff said he hopes the appeals court will follow a 9th Circuit decision of 
1985 that placed some limitations on "mechanized sentencing," a situation in 
which a judge has no discretion. "No one person may be used merely as an 
instrument of social policy," appellate Judge William Canby wrote in that case. 
</P>
<P>
Several constitutional and criminal law experts, however, said they believe 
Winrow faces an uphill struggle in efforts to get his sentence reduced. Appeals 
courts have been unreceptive to arguments that long, mandatory sentences 
violate the Constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Winrow's grandmother fervently hopes the experts are wrong. "I hate to have to 
sit up here," Roberta Green said, "and think I have to die and never see him 
again. I'd hate to die and think he'll never breathe the fresh air again, never 
walk again -- free." 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Winrow remains optimistic that he will not remain behind bars 
for the rest of his life. Asked how he would cope, though, if the appeals prove 
unsuccessful, Winrow said he will survive. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got strong family ties," he said resolutely. "Just as I lived on the 
street, I'll live in here."
