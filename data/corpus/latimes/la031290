MAGGIE GRUBB LAMBETH; LAST OF THE WORLD'S OLDEST TWINS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maggie Grubb Lambeth, the last of the sisters believed to be the world's oldest 
identical twins, died Tuesday at a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters, featured on Japanese television, in an American documentary and in 
the Guinness Book of World Records, were rarely separated throughout their 
lives until Allie Grubb Hill's death Jan. 10, three days shy of her 106th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Her sister was never told. 
</P>
<P>
Although they didn't have a tooth between them and shunned dentures, both 
centenarians attributed their longevity to chewing gum, which they consumed at 
a prodigious rate. 
</P>
<P>
In their 103rd year, Guinness proclaimed them the world's oldest twins, 
President Ronald Reagan telegraphed his greetings, a Japanese TV crew showed up 
at the nursing home where they lived and the National Institutes of Health 
featured them in a film on people living to 100. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Hill, the older twin by a few minutes, enjoyed the spotlight, while Mrs. 
Lambeth was more reserved. 
</P>
<P>
Both married as young women and had long outlived their husbands. They farmed, 
raised children and well into their 90s could be found digging sweet potatoes, 
carrots, eggplant and corn in their gardens just down the road from each other 
in this rural area northeast of Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
They remained healthy until Mrs. Lambeth broke her pelvis in 1984. After that 
both declined and they were admitted to the nursing home, where they lived only 
a hallway apart. 
</P>
<P>
At their deaths, they had 180 direct descendants: 16 living children, 48 
grandchildren, 85 great-grandchildren and 31 great-great grandchildren.

MARTIAL SINGHER; BARITONE, FAMED VOICE TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Martial Singher, the scholarly, lyrical French baritone who devoted his life to 
the subtleties of composers and librettists, personifying style both on the 
opera stages of the world and in the classrooms of the nation, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
The former head of the vocal department at the Music Academy of the West in 
Santa Barbara -- a position he assumed when the legendary Lotte Lehmann retired 
-- was 85 when he died Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Saunderson, a longtime friend, said from Santa Barbara that the 
fabled voice teacher had died of a longstanding heart condition at his home 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to many of his contemporaries, Singher was not of heroic stature nor 
of large voice, but for 30 years he was, said Times music critic Martin 
Bernheimer, "an artist of refinement . . ." who "the connoisseurs adored. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
When Willliam H. Seltsam compiled "Metropolitan Opera Annals" in 1947 he 
dedicated the work to only two singers: Geraldine Farrar, the great American 
diva, and Singher. 
</P>
<P>
"Singher," wrote Seltsam, "has proved that the standards of the great singing 
actors of the past survive in our own day." 
</P>
<P>
The elegant, stylish musicologist was highly regarded in this country from his 
first Metropolitan performance in 1943 in "The Tales of Hoffman." Virgil 
Thomson, the composer and critic, wrote in the Herald Tribune that Singher 
"gave a stage performance of incomparable elegance and did a piece of singing 
that for perfection of vocal style has not been equaled since Kirsten Flagstad 
went away." 
</P>
<P>
His roles ranged from Pelleas in Debussy's "Pelleas et Mellisande" to Escamillo 
in "Carmen" to Wolfram in "Tannhauser" to Lescaut in "Manon." 
</P>
<P>
He stayed with the Met through 200 performances but in 1959 a heart disorder 
ended his career as a performer but proved a blessing to what would be hundreds 
of students. 
</P>
<P>
He taught at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, at Peabody and at UCLA, in 
Aspen and at the Marlboro Festival before settling in Santa Barbara where he 
would remain until his retirement in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
There he took over from Miss Lehmann, teaching voice and the literature of song 
while managing the opera department and its annual productions. 
</P>
<P>
His students there included Rodney Gilfry, James King, John Reardon, Judith 
Blegen, Jeanine Altmeyer, and many more who have gone on to their own 
illustrious careers. 
</P>
<P>
He taught unknowns in relatively modest surroundings because he said he "lacked 
the strength and perhaps the authority to work with stars." He had considered 
for a time becoming a vocal coach and teacher for the nobility of the opera 
world but "I soon found out they wouldn't do what I said. Can you imagine what 
I would have had to go through getting Mario del Monaco (the Italian tenor) to 
sing Don Jose in a semblance of French. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"No! (besides) I love to work with young people. Working with fresh talent 
permits me to be faithful to the original (score). . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Oloron-Saint-Marie in Basses-Pyrenees, Singher at first wanted to teach 
school but a gift for song sent him to the Paris Conservatory for study. 
</P>
<P>
He first performed professionally in Amsterdam and then in Paris both with the 
Paris Opera and the Opera Comique before coming to the United States in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
After retiring in 1981, he wrote "An Interpretive Guide to Operatic Arias." 
</P>
<P>
Asked on the eve of his farewell Santa Barbara production in August, 1981, how 
he had managed to get such quality work from such embryonic voices, he replied: 
</P>
<P>
"You can get anything you want from anyone. . . . All you have to do is kill 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Margareta, the daughter of conductor Fritz Busch; 
three sons and a grandson. Services are pending.

MWD MAY ORDER PLANS FOR WATER CUTBACKS; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: CITIES IN THE EASTERN COUNTY MAY BE FORCED TO FOLLOW THE CITY OF 
VENTURA'S LEAD IN CONTINGENCY PLANNING. THE WATER DISTRICT IS ASSESSING 
RAINFALL LEVELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Cutbacks in the supply of state water to the major cities of eastern Ventura 
County -- including Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley -- may be considered as early 
as next month because of the state's continuing drought, according to a 
regional water official. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the eastern county has been virtually unaffected by the drought 
until now, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California said that could change in April after the state officially assesses 
rainfall levels of the last year. 
</P>
<P>
"At this moment, we are not planning any cutbacks," spokesman Jay Malinowski 
said. "But that could change at the end of the month." 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water District, which receives most of its water from the 
state water project, supplies the Calleguas Municipal Water District, which in 
turn supplies water to Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley, Moorpark, Camarillo and 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Although the regional water district has not announced any cutbacks, Malinowski 
said cities in the county could be asked as early as this week to begin drawing 
up water-reduction ordinances that could be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Malinowski said the issue has arisen because the end of March marks the end of 
the so-called "rain year," the period in which the state's annual rainfall is 
officially assessed. 
</P>
<P>
If, as expected, the state Department of Water Resources, which operates the 
state water project, determines that not enough rain has fallen this year to 
meet the demands of its customers, cutbacks may be required, Malinowski said. 
</P>
<P>
Malinowski said he could not estimate the amount of cutback expected, saying 
only that he does not expect it to be as large as 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Directors of the board of the Metropolitan Water District will vote Tuesday on 
a resolution that would ask all cities and government agencies in Southern 
California that use water provided by the district to pass water-reduction 
ordinances that could be immediately implemented with word from Metropolitan, 
Malinowski said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want these ordinances on the books so they can be called into play 
immediately," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt O. Reithmayr, principal engineer for the city of Thousand Oaks and 
director on the Calleguas Municipal Water board, said Calleguas has already 
begun to consider such a standby ordinance. But he said he was surprised to 
learn that cutbacks from Metropolitan may be imminent. 
</P>
<P>
"Until now, Met has supplied all the water we've needed," Reithmayr said. 
"We're sitting fine now, but if Met cuts us back, we will have to pass it 
along. 
</P>
<P>
"Demand is constantly going up and supply is getting worse," he said. "There 
will certainly be a crunch and I think it's going to come very, very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure that eastern areas of the county may soon be faced with water 
cutbacks follows months of debate over cutbacks and rationing in some cities in 
the county's westernmost region, which are not linked to the state water 
system. 
</P>
<P>
In the most drastic water conservation measure considered in the county, the 
Ventura City Council is expected to formally approve a strict new water 
rationing plan tonight on all of the city's residential and business water 
customers. That measure has already received preliminary approval. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Ventura ordinance includes stiff penalties for exceeding the water 
rations, Ventura officials said this week they hope their plan will inspire 
cooperation instead of resentment. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which is modeled after one in place in the unincorporated area 
of Santa Barbara County known as Goleta, cuts water allocations to industrial 
and commercial users by 15% to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance assigns quotas by household. Allocations for houses start at 294 
gallons per day, based on four-person family. Allocations for apartment 
dwellers begin at 196 gallons per day, based on a three-person household. 
</P>
<P>
The Goleta Water District imposed a similar rationing plan on May 1, 1989, 
after the operators of Lake Cachuma told the district that its allocation of 
water would be reduced by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Farwell, conservation coordinator at Goleta, said the restrictions 
imposed so far in Goleta amount to about a 15% cutback. He added, however, that 
residents have cut back even more than that, reducing their usage by about 40% 
and contributing to an overall 28% reduction for all homes and businesses in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when further cutbacks are expected from Lake Cachuma, Farwell said 
that puts the district in good shape now. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,600 appeals for extra water allocations since the program started, 
Farwell said, only 70 have been denied. 
</P>
<P>
The rationing in Goleta, however, has caused some problems for residents. 
</P>
<P>
David Moore was one of the 70 residents turned down in a request for extra 
water after claiming that the duplex he owns should be viewed as two separate 
houses instead of multiple-dwelling units. 
</P>
<P>
He and his grown son and small daughter live in half of the duplex he owns, 
which he said has three bedrooms and two baths on each side. He rents out the 
second side. Each side receives an allocation of about 58 gallons per person, 
the Goleta allowance for multiple housing units. 
</P>
<P>
"We have lawns, we have laundry," he said. "But they didn't want to hear it at 
all. A duplex is a multiple unit and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the Goleta area, lawns are starting to brown. 
</P>
<P>
Many Goleta residents are using the techniques that the district has suggested 
in a public education campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a bucket in our shower for when we're waiting for the water to get 
warm," said 9-year-old Justin Ramirez, the son of Jill and Tony Ramirez. "We 
take the water out and throw it on the plants." 
</P>
<P>
Similar techniques will be suggested as part of a public education campaign in 
Ventura, which will begin with a brochure mailing on March 23, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura water shortage originates at Lake Casitas, which is nearing the 
level at which it cannot sustain a prolonged drought, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
The Casitas Municipal Water District, which supplies most of the water used by 
the city of Ventura, and a small portion of that used by the city of Ojai, will 
soon hold public hearings on an ordinance that would cut the amount of water 
its customers receive. 
</P>
<P>
John Johnson, general manager for Casitas, said he believes the Ojai Valley has 
time to move more slowly into a water rationing program than the city of 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Johnson is recommending that the Casitas Board of Directors 
declare a water shortage emergency when it holds a public hearing Wednesday 
night, call for an immediate 20% voluntary cutback on all customer demands and 
begin a 45-day moratorium on new service connections. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he is proposing a six-stage program for water conservation 
throughout the district. To give the public time to discuss the plan, he said 
he will suggest to the Casitas board that it delay adoption of the full program 
until another public hearing April 11.

THE TULLY CASE: DOG WAS VICTIM -- SOME SAY TAXPAYERS, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trial of Ojai newspaper publisher Darrow (Duke) Tully for cruelty to 
animals hung on a simple question: Had he used only necessary force to protect 
himself and his property when he shot a neighbor's dog with a pellet gun? 
</P>
<P>
However, by the time a Municipal Court jury found Tully guilty Thursday, the 
trial had raised questions about whether the prosecution was a waste of money. 
And it had again focused public attention on the controversial journalist. 
</P>
<P>
Tully gained notoriety in 1985 when he resigned as publisher of Arizona's two 
largest newspapers after admitting he had lied for 30 years about being a 
decorated combat pilot. 
</P>
<P>
A fit-looking 58-year-old with a military bearing, Tully was convicted on a 
single misdemeanor count of animal cruelty and placed on probation for six 
months. A judge also ordered his pellet gun destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said they found the case difficult to decide partly because fine legal 
points sometimes were blurred by concerns about whether Tully should have been 
tried at all. 
</P>
<P>
On the key legal point, the jury concluded that Tully, who testified that his 
pellet gun is a toy used by his 6-year-old stepson, was not in any real danger 
during the October incident and had reached too quickly for the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
He admitted to mistakenly wounding a small terrier while trying to "sting" a 
larger dog that had snarled at him in his yard -- thereby legally establishing 
his intent to wound an animal. 
</P>
<P>
On the broader issues, juror John McCarthy said he and others on the panel 
sympathized with Tully's problems with roving dogs and wondered why the 
neighbors' dispute had not been resolved without a costly trial. 
</P>
<P>
"After the trial, a lot of us were thinking that there may have been some 
pressure to bear in bringing these charges," said McCarthy, a geophysicist from 
Ojai. "My own feeling all along was that he was tried because he was a person 
of some prominence. I just wondered, 'How did it get to that stage?' These are 
things that can be settled between neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
The juror noted that a sheriff's deputy testified that Mary Bishop, the 
67-year-old owner of the wounded dog, had only wanted the officer to talk to 
Tully without writing a report on the incident. The Humane Society of Ventura 
County filed a cruelty complaint with the district attorney last November after 
the organization received a call from Bishop's son, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Tully, who was named editor and publisher of the triweekly Ojai Valley News in 
1987, said he thought the trial was fair and the prosecution not malicious. But 
he said he had spoken to five jurors after the verdict and they agreed that the 
trial was a waste of taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
"Every single one I talked to said it shouldn't have come to trial . . . but 
that they had to go by the technical points" of the law and find him guilty, 
Tully said. 
</P>
<P>
Tully faced a maximum sentence of one year in jail and a $20,000 fine. Judge 
Bruce A. Clark imposed neither, placing him on probation and ordering him to 
pay restitution of $240 for the wounded dog's surgery, a fee that Tully said he 
had been willing to pay since the incident. 
</P>
<P>
A Municipal Court trial costs several thousand dollars a day to conduct, said 
Presiding Judge Lee E. Cooper Jr., and Tully's trial lasted four days, 
including one for jury deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of why Tully was tried surfaced even during the trial, when Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Mark R. Pachowicz mentioned it during his closing argument: 
</P>
<P>
"We've spent three days figuring out whether or not Mr. Tully had the right to 
shoot a dog because he crapped on his lawn. . . . You may be thinking, 'Is this 
the criminal justice system?' " 
</P>
<P>
Pachowicz argued that even though Tully did not kill Baby, the 12-year-old 
cockapoo terrier he shot between the eyes, the case was important. An acquittal 
would tell the public, he said, that it is open season on animals that wander. 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict, the prosecutor said the decision "shows the community that 
there are certain ways to handle problems. The right way is not to pull a gun 
and shoot a dog." 
</P>
<P>
In interviews during the trial, Humane Society officers said they had asked the 
district attorney to prosecute the case, despite the dog owner's reluctance, 
because it was an example of severe abuse and could be proved. 
</P>
<P>
The Humane Society receives about 700 complaints of animal abuse a year in 
Ventura County but asks the district attorney to file charges in only about a 
dozen, said Robert J. Hoffman, spokesman for the nonprofit agency. The district 
attorney decides whether the case is worth prosecuting. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said the Tully case was the first to be filed in more than six years 
that involved the shooting of a roving dog. "It's really one of the first times 
anyone has given us eyewitness accounts. It's the first one we felt would fly." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's case was accepted by the jury in part because of Tully's own 
admissions and his apparent lack of remorse, juror McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
Tully testified that he told deputies he was justified in shooting at a large 
Labrador retriever, which he said had growled, bared its teeth and raised the 
hair on its back when he tried to open a gate to release three neighborhood 
dogs trapped in his yard. 
</P>
<P>
Tully said he retreated, returned with a pellet gun and fired at the rump of 
the larger dog. He missed and the lead pellet compressed against the terrier's 
skull between its eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I said that under the circumstances, I'd do exactly the same thing again," 
Tully testified. 
</P>
<P>
During 1 1/2 hours on the stand, Tully was direct, detailed and colorful. In 
describing the morning of the shooting, he volunteered that he sleeps in the 
nude, usually gets out of bed at 6:55 a.m. and shaves with a straight razor. 
</P>
<P>
He said he keeps three handguns in his house and could have used one of them if 
he had wanted to hurt the dogs. But that would have been "like using a cannon 
to kill an ant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the dog he shot, he said, "It's a little dog. I'm not usually afraid 
of little dogs." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, referring to his pellet gun, Tully told the prosecutor that he 
had "offered to let people shoot me with it since the incident to see what it 
feels like. And I offer you the same opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Pachowicz responded: "That's very gracious of you." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy said that despite Tully's "macho" comments, the jury saw him as a 
highly believable witness. 
</P>
<P>
"We may have not liked his demeanor, he was a little arrogant and he felt 
self-righteous in what he did, but he was considered the most reliable 
witness," the juror said. 
</P>
<P>
Tully's credibility was important because both Pachowicz and defense attorney 
George C. Eskin argued in closing that either Tully or his neighbor, Bishop, 
had lied on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tully insisted that he neither saw nor spoke to the woman until after 
he had shot the terrier, she testified that she had pleaded with him not to 
shoot her dog or the Labrador, which was owned by her son.

Tully said he would not appeal the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"I am considering my own legal action," he said, refusing to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that Bishop had offered to settle out of court for about 
$3,000 the week before the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop denied offering a settlement and referred all questions to Pachowicz. 
</P>
<P>
"Any comments made by Mrs. Bishop in that vein," Pachowicz said, "were made 
without our authority and were not at our request." 
</P>
<P>
A settlement between Bishop and Tully would have had "no effect on our desire 
to prosecute," he said.

FEDERAL FUNDING SOUGHT FOR LARGE WATER PROJECTS; 
</P>
<P>
RESOURCES: SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS AT VENTURA HARBOR AND FLOOD-CONTROL SYSTEMS FOR 
TWO RIVERS TOP THE $7-MILLION AID REQUEST.

<P>
From crashing waves in Ventura Harbor to floods along the Santa Clara River, 
Ventura County officials are beseeching the federal government to help curtail 
water-driven threats to the county's agricultural, fishing and tourist 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
Water, the coastal county's economic and recreational lifeblood, is the focus 
of several initiatives before Congress. If all are approved, the total cost 
would be about $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
None of the measures, however, would address the city of Ventura's most 
immediate water-related crisis: lack of it. The City Council gave preliminary 
approval to strict water-conservation measures last week because of a drought, 
and the matter is scheduled to come up for a final vote tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the problem with water in Southern California: When you get it, it's 
not where you want it," said John Doherty, senior aide to Rep. Robert J. 
Lagomarsino (R-Ojai), who is leading the push for federal authorization of 
several water projects in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The costliest is the Ventura Port District's $6.45-million plan to reduce the 
rough, 12-to-14-foot waves and the gradual shoaling at the harbor's entrance 
that have capsized or damaged more than 60 vessels since 1982 and required 
annual dredging. 
</P>
<P>
Other proposed Ventura County water projects include a $500,000 flood-warning 
system for the Santa Clara River and the cleanup of a partly completed 
flood-control system at the Santa Paula Creek, a tributary. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government would pay for 80% of the Ventura Harbor project; the 
Ventura Port District would pick up the remaining $1.28 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The entrance to Ventura Harbor is the most dangerous in Southern California," 
Richard S. Hambleton Jr., chairman of the district's Board of Port 
Commissioners, told the House Public Works and Transportation subcommittee on 
water resources last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Vessel casualties are, unfortunately, a regular occurrence," he said. "This 
state of affairs results from the fact that dangerous shoal and wave conditions 
can develop in the entrance very suddenly and frequently." 
</P>
<P>
To drive home his point, Hambleton gave subcommittee members sequential 
photographs of a 36-foot sailboat as it was submerged in thundering waves and 
subsequently tossed into the air. Other shots showed swamped crews and boats 
adrift in choppy seas. 
</P>
<P>
The project calls for a 300-foot extension of the harbor's detached breakwater 
to improve wave sheltering, the addition of a 250-foot spur groin to the end of 
the north jetty to increase deflection of sand flows into a sand trap and the 
construction of a 650-foot groin on the South Beach to trap drift material. 
Each is a rock structure. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the channel entrance would be extended and the sand trap at the 
mouth of the harbor would be dredged deeper to diminish the waves and to 
increase the sand-storage capacity. 
</P>
<P>
These recommendations, which emerged from six years of study by the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers, would allow the corps to dredge the harbor every other year 
instead of annually, Hambleton said. The dredging operation costs $1 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The primary beneficiaries, said Hambleton and district General Manager Richard 
Parsons, would be the commercial fishing industry, private tourist outings to 
the Channel Islands National Park and recreational boaters. Fishermen brought 
in catches of more than 12 million tons in 1988, the most recent year for which 
figures are available. 
</P>
<P>
Choppy conditions have caused $47,000 in annual damage to the harbor as well as 
occasional broken bones and concussions, Parsons said. In addition, harbor 
vessels are prevented from leaving or entering about 110 days a year. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino expressed confidence that money for the harbor project will be 
included in this year's Water Resources Development Act. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lagomarsino and Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) have sponsored 
legislation seeking approval of the Santa Clara River and Santa Paula Creek 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clara River runs from the Santa Clarita Valley in northern Los 
Angeles County through the Ventura County communities of Piru, Fillmore and 
Santa Paula and between Ventura and Oxnard to the ocean. Early this century, 
the San Francisquito Dam on the river in Los Angeles County collapsed, causing 
many deaths and great damage. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed flood-warning system calls for the installation of solar-powered 
monitoring devices in mountains and forest recesses. The devices would 
instantly gauge the accumulation of rainwater and the height of the river and 
convey that information by radio to county flood-control base stations in 
Ventura and Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
The Army Corps of Engineers, which proposed the Santa Clara warning system, is 
building a similar project on the Whitewater River. The Whitewater is in a 
rugged canyon above Palm Springs and is subject to flash floods. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Paula Creek flood-control project previously was approved by 
Congress. After the corps built a rectangular, reinforced-concrete 
flood-control channel upstream of the river in 1972, however, an environmental 
group sued to block the project until a court-approved environmental impact 
statement was completed. 
</P>
<P>
The corps never completed the impact statement and insists that the project is 
no longer economically justified. In the meantime, the partly completed channel 
has been severely damaged by floods and, Lagomarsino said, "poses a serious 
threat of flooding" itself because large slabs point the wrong way and could 
obstruct the creek's flow. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, "If the slabs break loose, they could carry down and dash 
against bridges." 
</P>
<P>
The corps and the county's Flood Control District have been negotiating over 
the possibility of proceeding with a scaled-down project or simply removing the 
battered concrete channel. 
</P>
<P>
To assure that a legislative vehicle is available if an agreement is reached, 
Lagomarsino has introduced a measure that would require the corps to provide 
assistance to the flood district when the warning system predicts a peak flood 
flow of greater than 16,000 cubic feet per second on the Santa Paula Creek. He 
said the bill eventually would be amended to include any eventual understanding 
between the corps and the county. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to these initiatives, Ventura County and the United Water 
Conservation District may seek an additional loan of $4 million to $5 million 
from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation for the Freeman Diversion. 
</P>
<P>
That project is a $20-million dam that is being built to channel water from the 
Santa Clara River into the Oxnard Aquifer, offsetting the intrusion of seawater 
due to over-pumping by farmers. The river water will be used for agricultural 
irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Gientke, water district general manager, said last week that the 
additional loan will be needed only if construction runs into unexpected 
hurdles that force changes in the original design. 
</P>
<P>
"We are keeping our options open," Gientke said of the project.

BOY HOSPITALIZED AFTER PIT BULL ATTACK

<P>
A 10-year-old Oxnard boy remained in satisfactory condition Sunday after being 
attacked by two pit bullterriers, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul J. Lucero had to undergo surgery to his left leg and ankle and is expected 
to remain at St. John's Regional Medical Center for at least a week, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Lucero was attacked about 6:30 p.m. Thursday as he played with two other boys 
in the 800 block of West Cedar Court near Durley Park, Oxnard Police Lt. Gordon 
Hubbard said. 
</P>
<P>
After the boys saw the dogs running toward them, they ran to the rear of a 
nearby apartment complex, Hubbard said. Lucero tried to climb a metal pole but 
was dragged down by the pit bulls. 
</P>
<P>
One of the other boys who tried to help Lucero suffered a minor scratch to his 
left leg, Hubbard said. Wrestled to the ground, Lucero was unable to fend off 
the dogs as they tore at his leg. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was going to die," Lucero said from his hospital bed. His mother, 
Connie Lucero, stood nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why people want to have dogs like that," she said. "I think they 
should ban pit bulls in the county. I don't want this to happen to someone 
else. It is awful to go through." 
</P>
<P>
With the help of the other two boys, police were able to find the owner and his 
dogs. The animals are being kept at the county animal shelter for observation 
for two weeks to determine whether they are rabid. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to get a gun and kill them," the young boy said. CARLOS LOZANO

DISTRICT TO EXPAND ANTI-DRUG EFFORT

<P>
The Somis Union School District's Board of Trustees is moving to bolster its 
alcohol- and drug-education programs to help obtain more federal and state 
funding for fighting substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Board members, representing a Ventura County district with one kindergarten 
through eighth-grade school of 321 students, said the decision was solely based 
on the need for Somis to be in compliance with new federal and state 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"There's money available through the county and down to the school districts, 
but you have to create certain policies," said Dale Forgey, Somis principal and 
district superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain kinds of conditions need to exist in order to get money, which 
includes things like a community involvement from law enforcement and staff. 
What we're going to do is expand our old program and infuse more money into 
staff development and student training." 
</P>
<P>
Somis received $500 in federal and state aid last year, Forgey said. He added 
that by enhancing the drug-education programs, the district will receive as 
much as $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not doing this because we think we have a drug problem. We're doing this 
because we don't want to get a drug problem," Board President Alda Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
In other business, the board voted to eliminate health benefits as an option 
for future Somis board members. SCOTT LAWRENCE

FIDDLERS PLAY TO BEAT THE BAND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sequestered in an enclosed listening booth to avoid being swayed by many 
contestants' colorful Western garb, judges at Oak View's Fourth Annual Old-Time 
Amateur Fiddle Contest had their work cut out for them Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
For nine hours, they concentrated as the 56 contestants played polkas, 
hoe-downs and rags with varying degrees of skill. The fiddlers ranged in age 
from elementary schoolchildren, who nervously clutched their pint-size violins, 
to senior citizens, who have been playing for decades. 
</P>
<P>
As one contestant after another sawed away at his or her fiddle, judge Rae 
Huffman of Oxnard, a fiddler herself, said this year's talent was "absolutely 
outstanding." Another judge, obviously overwhelmed after the first hour, 
demanded that coffee be prepared "right away." 
</P>
<P>
The free contest, sponsored by the Ventura County chapter of the California 
Old-Time Fiddlers Assn., was created four years ago after officials stopped 
letting fiddlers play at the annual county fair, Huffman said. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't want the fair audience to just sit there and listen to the 
fiddling; they wanted people to get up and spend money," Huffman said. "So we 
decided to do our own thing, and I think it's worked out just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the contest is to encourage youngsters to learn fiddle music 
and prevent it from dying out, said Sam Hackett, 65, a retired high school 
teacher who lives in Ventura and is a member of the Old-Time Fiddlers group. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our heritage -- it goes back to the pioneers," said Hackett, who wore a 
cowboy hat and Western tie, like many of the people, numbering about 100, who 
attended the contest at the Oak View Community Center. "Besides, it's happy, 
wholesome music. Of course, we all drink beer, but you don't see the rest of 
the junk that goes on in other places." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the music was imported from Ireland and Scotland by Western pioneers 
who didn't have room to carry pianos in their covered wagons, said Adrian Bush, 
chairman of the association. 
</P>
<P>
One contestant, Sameer Sharma, 7, of Camarillo, whose grandmother wore a sari 
to the event, said that playing Western music is easier than playing classical 
music from India. His family enjoys listening to Sameer's fiddling because it 
is "more human" than traditional Indian music, said his mother, Surekha Sharma, 
a physician who emigrated to the United States 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Sharma took first place in the "pee wee" category of contestants up to age 8. 
His sister Saanka came in first among youngsters up to 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
In the junior category, which included fiddlers ages 13 to 17, Rocio Marron of 
Camarillo took first place. Susan Thielmann of Santa Barbara took first place 
in the women's division. In the men's division, Roy Lancaster of Atwater won 
first place. Burt Lewis of Los Angeles came in first among seniors. 
</P>
<P>
The winners were awarded gold trophies. TRACEY KAPLAN

Moorpark officials were considering redrafting a proposed ordinance that would 
force restaurants and bars serving alcohol to close at 1 a.m. after questions 
were raised about its legality. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said any new proposal would be reviewed by attorneys before it 
is presented to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
By imposing a blanket ordinance to close the businesses at 1 a.m., the city 
would violate a 56-year-old state law that allows alcohol to be served until 2 
a.m., said John Pierce, an attorney with the Department of Alcoholic Beverage 
Control, the state agency that regulates alcohol sales and consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark City Atty. Cheryl Kane said the law gives cities the option of 
imposing conditions such as early closing times on businesses that serve 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance would standardize the closing times for new and old 
restaurants and bars, which presently close between midnight and 2 a.m., 
according to Community Development Director Patrick Richards. It would also 
help police handle enforcement around closing time, he added. PSYCHE PASCUAL

TRAUMA UNIT BENEFIT SHOWS IT'S A SURVIVOR

Even now, Barbara Motis can't really remember how it happened. One moment, the 
Northridge school secretary was driving her Datsun 280-Z, her daughter Andrea 
beside her. The next, they were lying near death in the shattered remains of 
the car, which had collided with a garbage truck. 
</P>
<P>
Rushed to the trauma center at Northridge Hospital Medical Center last Aug. 7, 
Barbara, 54, went into cardiac arrest and had to be revived four times. 
Twenty-one-year-old Andrea, her head badly injured, underwent emergency surgery 
but slipped into a coma, where she remained for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday, mother and daughter were among three trauma survivors who smilingly 
accepted bouquets during a brunch fund-raiser for Northridge Hospital's trauma 
unit, one of only two such emergency-treatment centers in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when Los Angeles County's once-vaunted hospital trauma network is 
gradually collapsing due to heavy financial losses, Northridge Hospital remains 
committed to keeping its trauma unit in operation, said spokeswoman Leslie M. 
Wither. 
</P>
<P>
Although the trauma center loses about $1 million a year, it remains open 
because of the hospital's overall profitability, its relatively high percentage 
of insured patients and new county rules intended to prevent the county's 13 
remaining trauma units from being swamped with patients, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so lucky to be doing well. We've got an 85% occupancy rate," said 
Wither, referring to the hospital's healthy financial condition. That means the 
trauma center is "not folding," she said. 
</P>
<P>
To help offset its trauma losses, the hospital holds several fund-raising 
events each year. One such event was Sunday's brunch at a Granada Hills 
restaurant, which attracted more than 140 trauma survivors, hospital 
volunteers, nurses and doctors. The event was expected to raise about $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the trauma unit, we're here today," Barbara Motis said. "If it 
hadn't been for their persistence -- the doctors and the nurses -- I wouldn't 
be here." 
</P>
<P>
Trauma centers differ from emergency rooms -- which also treat severe injury 
victims -- because they have specially trained teams of surgeons, nurses and 
other specialists on duty 24 hours a day. Trauma centers also have 
round-the-clock access to special equipment, such as brain-scan machines. 
</P>
<P>
The county's trauma network, launched in 1983 with 23 participating hospitals, 
now has only 13 trauma units in operation. And that number will drop to 12 on 
May 1 when Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena closes its trauma facility. 
</P>
<P>
The only other trauma center in the San Fernando Valley is Holy Cross Medical 
Center in Mission Hills, which lost $2 million last year. St. Joseph Medical 
Center in Burbank pulled out of the system last April. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with rising financial losses caused by reduced government reimbursements 
and uninsured patients who cannot pay for their medical care, officials at 
hospitals throughout the county say they are being forced to drop out of the 
trauma network. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey E. Flocken, Northridge Hospital's chief executive officer, said the 
hospital expects some relief as a result of $1.4 million earmarked for it under 
Prop. 99, the tobacco-tax initiative passed by voters in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Barbara Koenig, the hospital's trauma services director, said it also has 
benefited from "at least a balance of paying and non-paying patients." 
</P>
<P>
She also cited new county rules intended to protect the remaining trauma units 
from being overloaded. Under those rules, paramedics and other emergency 
medical workers are required to take trauma victims to the nearest hospital, 
even if it doesn't have a trauma center. 
</P>
<P>
Although some doctors and nurses have ethical qualms about the rules, they are 
necessary to "keep from destroying the entire system," Koenig said.

HEAD OF CSUN DEAF CENTER QUITS AMID BUDGET PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The director of a nationally recognized program for deaf students at Cal State 
Northridge was asked to resign by campus officials for failing to properly 
manage funds that pay for classroom interpreters and other services for the 
deaf, school officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Victor H. Galloway, himself a graduate of CSUN's program for deaf students, 
submitted his resignation Thursday as director of the school's National Center 
on Deafness, university spokeswoman Ann Salisbury said. 
</P>
<P>
Galloway had met with top university officials earlier in the week to discuss 
reports that the center had spent nearly all of its $1.6-million budget for 
1989-90 and would run out of money to pay for services before the end of the 
spring semester, campus officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Larson, administrator of support services at the center, has been 
appointed acting director of the center, said Dorena Knepper, CSUN's director 
of governmental and administrative affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Knepper, acknowledging the center's financial troubles, described Larson as 
particularly adept at money management. 
</P>
<P>
She said through a spokeswoman that Larson is charged with "putting the center 
back on sound footing." 
</P>
<P>
University officials said Sunday that all of the center's programs would 
continue to operate through the end of the fiscal year in June. The university 
would make up for any shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
Galloway, through his wife, declined to be interviewed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The National Center on Deafness, formed in 1963, rose to national prominence as 
the first program to allow deaf students to attend regular college classes. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the center moved from the cramped bungalows that it had occupied for 
27 years to offices in the campus' new $2.7-million Jeanne M. Chisholm Hall. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 deaf students are enrolled in the CSUN program annually. They take 
classes with the assistance of specially trained interpreters and note-takers 
and study for a broad range of degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the growing financial troubles at the center recently reached the 
school's deaf students, who two weeks ago called for a meeting with Galloway. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 students and interpreters attended the meeting to express concern 
over the program's finances, campus officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Galloway was criticized for spending more on staff salaries than on student 
services, campus officials said. 
</P>
<P>
He was appointed director of the National Center on Deafness in 1986 to replace 
Ray Jones, who was fired by CSUN President James W. Cleary after directing the 
center for 23 years. School officials said at the time they wanted new 
leadership with fresh ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Galloway, who has been deaf since infancy, earned a master's degree through the 
CSUN National Leadership Training Program for educators of the deaf. 
</P>
<P>
Galloway has undergraduate degrees in math and science from Gallaudet College, 
a private school for deaf students in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
While working as a research chemist at Lockheed, he started to teach deaf 
assembly workers basic math and blueprint reading in his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he decided to pursue a career in education of the deaf and enrolled 
at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
Galloway was executive director of the Texas School for the Deaf prior to 
becoming the director at CSUN.

ANOTHER JAIL ESCAPEE CAPTURED, 7 STILL AT LARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sixth escapee from the County Jail in Chula Vista was captured Sunday, 
leaving seven prisoners still at large following a the biggest jailbreak in San 
Diego County history. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Christopher Neumann, who was jailed on petty theft charges before his 
escape, was arrested at 100 F Street by San Diego police who were acting on a 
tip from the Crime Stoppers hotline. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Scott Haney said that Neumann, who offered no resistance, had attempted 
to change his appearance by coloring his hair from blond to black and altering 
a tattoo. 
</P>
<P>
According to Haney, police were tipped off that Neumann, 29, was seen in the 
downtown area and that a stolen vehicle was en route to pick him up at F and 
Union streets. Police followed the vehicle and arrested Neumann and David 
Guinn, 33, who was driving the stolen car. Guinn was charged with auto theft 
and jailed. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are not the sharpest tools in the shed," said police Sgt. Jim 
Clear, commenting on the ease of the recent captures. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Williams, who was in jail on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon 
before his escape, was captured late Saturday, a few blocks away from the 
downtown police station. 
</P>
<P>
A tipster told police that Williams, 25, and two other persons were hiding in a 
camper parked in a lot at the corner of 15th and F streets. One of the other 
men was arrested on an outstanding felony warrant. 
</P>
<P>
The prisoners escaped last Wednesday from the South Bay jail's high security 
unit. They cut through the bars with hacksaws that were smuggled in and lowered 
themselves on bedsheets from a fourth-floor window. 
</P>
<P>
Red-faced Sheriff's Department officials and deputies who guard jail inmates 
were still coping with embarrassment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The county has hired private security guards to patrol the outside of the jail, 
making sure that prisoners stay inside. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors is expected to call for a review of 
security at all county jail facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Still at large Sunday night were three men -- AudiasGomez, 36; Christopher 
Bell, 21; and Sergio Martinez, 22 -- awaiting trial on murder charges and 
considered "very dangerous" by jail officials. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff John Duffy has complained repeatedly about overcrowding at the county's 
jail facilities. The Chula Vista jail has been the site of numerous riots and 
previous breakouts. Seven inmates escaped in December when they smashed through 
a window and lowered themselves on bedsheets. Two of those prisoners are still 
at large. Jail officials said that motion sensors in the windows are obsolete 
and no longer operable in the 8-year-old facility.

EX-BOYFRIEND, 2 MEN HELD IN WOMAN'S ABDUCTION AT GUNPOINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles police arrested a Sylmar man and two friends Sunday in connection 
with the kidnaping at gunpoint of the man's former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Savino Cano, 22, and Jose Martinez, 20, both of Sylmar and Maria Artiga, 22, of 
North Hollywood were arrested at a Sylmar motel about 10:30 a.m., about eight 
hours after they forced Cano's former girlfriend out of a carload of friends, 
said police Sgt. Rich Brown. 
</P>
<P>
The kidnaped woman, whose name was not released, was unharmed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the woman was on her way home from her job as a waitress at the 
Rancho Grande Bar in Pacoima with three friends just after 2 a.m. when their 
car was forced off the freeway onto an off-ramp by a car carrying Cano, 
Martinez and Artiga, who had handguns. 
</P>
<P>
The three men had harassed the woman at the bar earlier in the evening, Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the women's car, which was traveling south on the Golden State 
Freeway, pulled off at Osborne Street. Cano and Martinez went to the car and 
grabbed Cano's former girlfriend, who was sitting in the passenger seat, and 
drove off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The other women reported the incident to police, and gave them a description of 
the car and a license plate number. 
</P>
<P>
Officers Cleo Semerena and Joseph Penrod found the car parked at the Golden 
Star Inn Motel in the 12100 block of San Fernando Road in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
All three men were arrested on suspicion of kidnaping and assault with a deadly 
weapon. Bail for Cano, who was being held at the Foothill Division Jail, and 
Artiga, who was at the Van Nuys Division Jail, was set at $16,000. Martinez was 
at the Foothill Division Jail in lieu of $26,000 bail.

PREP SPORTS

<P>
In response to "Prep Sports -- Putting Fun Back," Part A, Feb. 17: 
</P>
<P>
While students, parents and coaches should never be excused from irresponsible, 
poor or bad sportsmanship nor should they be exonerated from severe and imposed 
penalties for indiscretions, breach of rules and the like, it is important to 
remember that the presidents, heads, principals, boards of trustees and 
district school boards are those who are ultimately responsible for prep school 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Such persons and boards must never abrogate their responsibilities and 
jurisdiction to prep school athletic governing boards such as the CIF and the 
AAF.

POOL USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am a swimmer, but not much of a swimmer. It has never occurred to me to enter 
a swim meet but swimming offers me a safe, low-stress workout that my 
40-year-old body appreciates. 
</P>
<P>
Since I learned of the Westwood Recreation Center last May, I have utilized the 
pool on an average of two to three mornings a week. 
</P>
<P>
I am very concerned about the recent uproar regarding the Southern California 
Aquatic Masters Swimmers Club sharing the pool with residents. I feel I have a 
unique perspective regarding the situation (Metro, Feb. 23). From May through 
December I swam "solo," paying $1 a session and enjoying my workout. During 
those months I never had to wait for a lane because of the masters workout or 
felt uncomfortable about the activity in the pool. Quite the contrary. One 
morning I asked the coach about the program and was encouraged to join their 
workout. 
</P>
<P>
For the last five weeks my swimming routine has improved significantly, my 
motivation to get in the pool at 7 a.m. has increased with new-found 
enthusiasm. I have never seen anyone waiting for a lane to swim independently. 
Rather than being a detriment to the facility, I believe the masters program 
offers a positive alternative within the community. 
</P>
<P>
I see no reason why both groups can't swim together and utilize the pool to its 
fullest potential.

STATISTICS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statistically accurate and factually descriptive report by David G. Savage 
in "1 in 4 Young Blacks in Jail or in Court, Study Says" (Part A, Feb. 27), 
nevertheless needs careful interpretation and a closer analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise unhealthy social stereotypes and prejudices will receive additional 
credence in our population. 
</P>
<P>
It is absolutely essential when comparing samples from different racial and 
ethnic groups that the samples are of similar groups, in addition to the bare 
fact of color or ethnic background. 
</P>
<P>
In studies of crime, it is important that socioeconomic factors are similar in 
the samples used in the study. For example, I believe it would be essential to 
compare crime rates for samples on the basis of several levels of income, or 
lack of it. In that way we could have a better look at the causes of crime, and 
aim for partial solutions. 
</P>
<P>
May I give an example of the need for interpretation: I believe we cannot 
compare teen-age pregnancies between black and white youngsters, unless the two 
groups compared are equivalent samples with regard to socioeconomic 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics in themselves may be accurate but misleading!

A WIDOW LAW TO PREVENT THE TEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's an old scam. A con artist approaches an elderly widow, persuades her to 
borrow against her home to pay for a new roof, aluminum siding or similar 
improvements. She agrees to what she thinks is a small loan with modest 
payments. She actually signs for a huge loan, with a high interest rate and 
exorbitant fees and commissions. Unless she can make the high payments, she is, 
in effect, signing away her home. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 1,000 elderly widows have lost their homes in South-Central Los 
Angeles, according to lawyers familiar with these scams. The problem is equally 
severe in East Los Angeles and other neighborhoods where runaway real-estate 
appreciation has boosted by tenfold or more the value of houses purchased and 
paid for decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
In just one recent example, a Watts widow was scheduled to lose her house until 
Legal Aid lawyers got involved. She wanted to replace her windows because of 
drafts. She unknowingly agreed to a $40,000 loan at an interest rate higher 
than 25% -- double the prevailing mortgage rate. She lacked the income to 
qualify for the loan, but according to the lawyers, the middlemen claimed she 
had income from rental property; she didn't. She was expected to make a loan 
payment that was more than double her meager monthly income. The deal included 
an $11,000 "finders fee" that was actually a commission; a $5,000 
"title-cleansing" fee, and an additional $2,000 for points. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation recently introduced by state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) would 
help discourage such rip-offs. The measure, SB 2641, would require the 
salespeople who go after vulnerable widows to at least be bonded and licensed 
by the state. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would also hold finance companies and investors, many of whom are 
wealthy, liable for any misrepresentations made by smooth-talking salespeople 
or so-called financial consultants who go door-to-door in search of the deals. 
By making the investors liable, according to the Legal Aid Foundation of Los 
Angeles, the proposed law would make it easier for courts to rule in favor of 
homeowners and prevent the loss of homes. 
</P>
<P>
The Torres bill wouldn't protect every naive homeowner. Nor would it stop every 
con artist. But it would provide additional protections for the vulnerable, and 
put the greedy on notice.

BUCHANAN ON COLLABORATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So Buchanan is calling the collaborators to account? It seems to me that a 
world struggling to free itself from opportunistic and uncaring overlords is 
bound to spawn leaders like Lenin, Mao, Castro, Ho and Ortega, standard-bearers 
dreaming of national self-determination, affordable education and health care 
and guaranteed employment. It's ironic that when the political offspring of 
such revolutionaries begin to live like fat-cat Republicans, forcing the people 
to throw them out, Buchanan should be the one sounding the call for a domestic 
blood bath. 
</P>
<P>
I ask him to look at how two terms of Reagan Administration mismanagement have 
devastated our nation's economic, educational and health-care systems. We'll be 
decades putting this country back together, spending billions to bailout banks, 
savings and loans, pension funds and insurance companies. The United States may 
never again be a world leader in public education and health care. We've been 
raped by petty opportunists and uncaring ideologues, and indeed the time has 
come to call the collaborators to account. Step forward please, Mr. Buchanan.

Buchanan's column is the worst poison-pen writing I have read for some time. 
</P>
<P>
To equate the efforts of "liberals" to obtain decent living and working 
conditions for American citizens with Nazi collaboration to murder millions of 
civilians is not only incredible, it is satanic. 
</P>
<P>
Surely the American right to free speech allows any citizen to talk and to work 
politically for fair and decent living conditions without the kind of moral 
slander and smearing Buchanan expresses. Why did The Times allow such toxic 
material to be printed?

FIDEL CASTRO: THE LAST CAUDILLO ; 
</P>
<P>
THE CHALLENGE IS TO BE PREPARED WHEN THE END COMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These are lonely days for Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba's jefe maximo always fancied himself a special character on the world 
stage -- a key actor not just in Latin America, where he was a symbol of 
revolutionary change, but also in the Soviet Bloc, for which he was an outpost 
near the U.S. mainland. But even Fidel's friends have been wondering lately 
whether time has passed him by. The answer is yes. And events of the last few 
weeks only emphasize just how much of an anachronism Castro has become. 
</P>
<P>
Start with the rapid collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe and the 
accelerating reform effort inside the Soviet Union itself. Castro was never a 
fan of Mikhail Gorbachev, or of perestroika. But as the Soviet leader 
consolidates his position in Moscow and former Warsaw Pact nations like Poland 
and Hungary go their own way, Fidel looks like the last Stalinist in the world. 
</P>
<P>
His Latin American friends are in retreat, too. The Sandinistas have been voted 
out by the Nicaraguan people and must now learn to work as a real political 
party or be relegated to the dustbin of history. The guerrillas in El Salvador 
would end the long civil war there if they were given a chance to negotiate. 
And the toughest rebels in the Western Hemisphere, Peru's Sendero Luminoso, say 
flatly that Castro's a wimp. 
</P>
<P>
Fidel doesn't even have anybody on the Latin American right to commiserate 
with: Chile's Augusto Pinochet is out, so Castro has the dubious distinction of 
being the last old-style dictator in Latin America. For the man whose victory 
over Fulgencio Batista in 1959 was supposed to inspire revolutions throughout 
the region, being the last caudillo may be the cruelest irony of all. 
</P>
<P>
Castro has been so much trouble for the U.S. government for so long -- eight 
presidents have worried about him, with little to show for it -- that some in 
Washington understandably might be tempted to gloat. But what U.S. 
policy-makers should be doing instead is planning to use the opportunity 
presented by Castro's growing isolation to try and draw Cuba back into the 
American (in the broadest sense of that word) system. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet news media have begun criticizing Castro for refusing to join 
communism's reform movement. That could presage a reduction of the $5 billion 
per year in Soviet aid Castro gets.If that aid ends, he'll have to look for 
help elsewhere; and if his neighbors are ready to respond, they can demand that 
he behave himself in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
But even if Castro refuses to face reality, he won't live forever. There is no 
one to take his place, and once he's gone, Cuba will change. By preparing now, 
the United States and the other democratic nations of the Americas can help 
ensure that the process is peaceful, like Czechoslovakia's, rather than 
violent, like Romania's.

FOOTNOTES: SINGING THE BLUE CROSS BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blue Cross of California has the blues because it thinks that the press is 
ignoring it, but the health insurer isn't suffering in silence. In a recent 
letter to the editor of the trade paper Managed HealthCare, Blue Cross Chief 
Executive Leonard D. Schaeffer complimented the editors for a recent article on 
the Blue Cross/Blue Shield system. 
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "as usual, the Chicago-based Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
Assn. and the Chicago Plan were interviewed for the article. We were not 
contacted, even though Blue Cross of California has more members in managed 
care than any other 'Blue' Plan." 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Blue Cross's public relations agency has been sending letters to 
editors offering interviews with the chairman, who is described as "the 
architect of a stunning two-year turnaround of the once-failing health 
insurance giant." 
</P>
<P>
A Royal Pain for Imperial 
</P>
<P>
Things are tough enough in the banking and thrift business without having 
people confuse you with a troubled operation. 
</P>
<P>
The woes at Imperial Savings &amp; Loan in San Diego are causing headaches for 
at least two unrelated Southern California institutions, Imperial Thrift &amp; 
Loan in Burbank and Imperial Bank in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial, the bank, is making sure people know that it has no ties to Imperial, 
the savings and loan. Its ads now include a paragraph in large letters: 
"Imperial Bank is not -- nor has it ever been -- affiliated with Imperial 
Savings &amp; Loan or its parent, Imperial Corp. of America." 
</P>
<P>
And Trouble at Lincoln Too 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lincoln Bancorp suffers from a similar problem. John J. Keating, 
chief executive of the Encino holding company for Lincoln National Bank, says, 
"I've got the double whammy." Customers and others muddle his bank's name with 
that of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, and they confuse him with Charles H. 
Keating Jr., the controversial chairman of the S&amp;L's parent company. The 
two are not related. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Bancorp's board wants to change the institution's name. There's an 
employee contest to rename the bank, but no one has yet won the prize, a 
Hawaiian vacation. Several suggestions were turned down. So was a consultant 
who offered to come up with a new name for $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bear Stearns' Miserly Ways 
</P>
<P>
In the current severe slump of the securities industry, the Wall Street firm 
Bear Stearns Cos. is one of the relatively few prospering brokerages. This is 
in part because of the notorious penny-pinching ways of the firm's chairman and 
chief executive, Alan C. (Ace) Greenberg. Staffers complain that paper clips, 
pencils and rubber bands are in short supply. Employees are told to save paper 
clips from incoming mail. Now Greenberg has carried the campaign a step 
further: Employees recently received notification that they will have to turn 
their frequent-flyer miles from business trips back to the company to be used 
to pay for other business trips. But one staff member said it probably won't 
make much difference to most employees. "People never have time to even take 
vacations," the executive said.

TIMES BOOK EDITOR HEADS CRITICS CIRCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Miles, book editor of the Los Angeles Times, has been named president of 
the National Book Critics Circle. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always talking about how the literary world is a New York-East 
Coast Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
One of the things we were proud to affirm by having Jack be our president is 
that is not the case," said Thomas M. Disch, vice president and secretary of 
the organization. "The National Book Critics Circle is a national organization, 
and it's wonderful that we should have a president who is located on one of our 
coasts other than the Eastern one. It's about time." 
</P>
<P>
Miles, Disch added, was selected by acclamation by the group's board of 
directors, who represent 591 members throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
The circle is best known for its prestigious annual literary awards in fiction, 
poetry, general nonfiction, biography and criticism. "But our main function is 
to look after the interests of book reviewers," said Disch, noting that in the 
natural course of his work at The Times, Miles will also be doing the work of 
the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining The Times in 1985, Miles was executive editor of the University 
of California Press at UCLA, where he was responsible for generating and seeing 
into print about 25 titles a year. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Chicago, Miles spent 10 years as a Jesuit seminarian, educated in 
Rome, Germany and Israel as well as in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He received a Ph.D. in Near Eastern languages from Harvard University in 1971 
and has taught at Loyola University of Chicago. Miles has also taught at the 
University of Montana and worked as an editor at Doubleday &amp; Co.

'MACHO-MAN' NOVEL SPREADS MORE THAN BLOOD AND GORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLYN SEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOOSE JAM by Wayne Wilson Delacorte Press $17.95, 263 pages 
</P>
<P>
This first novel is filled with such macho-man prose as: "There was a flash of 
red and his head seemed to stretch like a ball of dough. Blood squirted down 
the front of his shirt. A fist slammed into his belly, lifting him to his toes, 
driving the air from his lungs. Doubled up and choking, Henry fell to the 
pavement." 
</P>
<P>
But although maybe 20% of this narrative is filled with bar fights, road fights 
and house fights, and another 20% is composed of generic rape, murder and 
pillage, "Loose Jam" is far, far more than a man's-man novel. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it's true a gun goes off every dozen pages -- whether in Vietnam 
flashbacks or the stormy California present. It's true men bite each other and 
bash each other with pots and pans and brass Buddhas, and nobody is 
"half-stepping" here, and even the villains are righteous in their villainy. 
But the novel, just under all this action-movie stuff, is about love, 
friendship, second chances and whether life is worth it. 
</P>
<P>
As "Loose Jam" opens, Henry Brown, Vietnam vet and former side man for pianist 
Miles Duckworth, self-styled "voice of a generation," is padding quietly into 
middle age, bugged by the sour knowledge that life, as he's living it, is full 
of fifth and sixth choices. 
</P>
<P>
Henry works up in San Luis Obispo as the manager of someone else's record 
store. He rents someone else's house. He's got a crush on a good woman, but he 
can't get to first base with her. He's sore as a boil about everything: He's 
fat; he's bald; he lives on a diet of doughnuts, lasagna and tequila; he has to 
put up with small-town and small-time posturing on every side. His boss is a 
culture-monger, but that's just the tiny tip of the iceberg. To Henry, 
everything is bleak, everything sad. He's convinced that, at 40, his life is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Enter -- on crutches, dirty and drunk -- Miles Duckworth, out ofthe past. His 
band is gone; he's been playing in pizza joints, and a wound from 'Nam has left 
him with just the one leg. But all that is nothing. What's worrying Miles is 
that another veteran, a creepy sociopath called Policy Man, is out of prison 
and after him, sworn to murder Miles, still holding a 20-year grudge. 
</P>
<P>
Miles plays immediate hell with Henry's life. Miles swears and pukes and 
dithers at such a high pitch that within a couple of days (it makes you wonder 
exactly how up-tight San Luis Obispo is as a community), Henry's lost his house 
and his job. He, Miles and Martha -- the woman of Henry's dreams -- drive south 
to Los Angeles, then out to Pomona to confront their respective screwed-up 
pasts. And in a rust-colored van, the Policy Man, with a stupid and murderous 
sidekick called Byron, hurtle after them, determined to settle that 20-year 
score. 
</P>
<P>
A word about clumsiness, and then about Art. Clumsiness looms large in this 
legend. Henry, while driving, chokes on bread and olive oil, and manages to 
make it all come out his nose. Miles spills wine, and leaves the fire on under 
kettles until they melt into the stove. Even Policy Man bungles a burglary by 
stopping for a Milky Way at a candy-bar machine and getting his hand stuck in 
the slot. The author is telling us, and can't stop telling us, that all these 
guys, the good and the bad, are misfits. They don't fit, plain and simple, and 
it goes back before the war to their white trash origins. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, their music is there as a perfect saving grace, the one 
immutable thing in an otherwise terribly imperfect world. 
</P>
<P>
Henry idolizes his grandfather, who first taught him to play the guitar, and, 
watching him, thinks, "What a pleasure it was to watch the old man's simplest 
gestures; like his handwriting, they reflected an archaic elegance, a flair, 
that made Henry think of harmony saxes and Edwin Clapp shoes. . . . Was there 
anything as nice as the way old men played? Stephane Grappelli, Furry Lewis, 
Doc Watson, Jelly Roll -- absolute harmony of heart and fingers." 
</P>
<P>
There are a few things to complain about: 
</P>
<P>
The accent on Stephane is there, but left off "Norteno" music. The veterans' 
parade and migrant workers' strike created in the first half of this novel is 
neglected in the second. And there are three characters who "throw back their 
head and laugh." 
</P>
<P>
But this is nit-picking (or close-editing) of a fine book that aims at the 
highest goal: "What do you think about when you think about trying to be a good 
man?" "Loose Jam" deserves respectful reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Next: "The World of Mathematics," edited with commentaries and notes by James 
R. Newman (Tempus Books).

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: For some time, I've been thinking of going on a diet because I know I 
should lose about 40 pounds. But I've heard about a new product that is 
supposed to look like fat and to taste like fat, but which doesn't have any 
calories. 
</P>
<P>
I think something such as this would make dieting much easier, and I'd like to 
know if you have any idea when it will be available. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: One of the nation's leading food producers is working on a product 
called Olestra, which, as you say, is supposed to look and taste like fat but 
is calorie-free. The product's technical name is sucrose polyester. 
</P>
<P>
Although Olestra has been under development for several years, it will probably 
take several more years before it reaches the market. There are always 
rationalizations to delay going on a diet, but the best time is always now.

Julie Kavner was the only double winner during the ceremony. She was named 
funniest supporting film actress for "New York Stories" and funniest supporting 
actress in a TV series for "The Tracey Ullman Show." Tracey Ullman upset 
Roseanne Barr and Candice Bergen to win funniest female performer in a TV

Opera in the Amazon: Opera will be performed in the heart of the Amazon rain 
forest for the first time in more than 80 years when the legendary Teatro 
Amazonas reopens Saturday after a three-year, $8-million restoration. 
</P>
<P>
The theater was built in the city of Manaus in 1896 at the height of Brazil's 
rubber boom. But the theater staged its last opera in 1907, when Brazilian 
rubber began losing its markets to Southeast Asian exporters. Opening night of 
Opera Brasil will feature excerpts of "Guarany," an opera by Carlos Gomes. 
Placido Domingo will appear in "Carmen" on March 29. BETH KLEID

'LAST OF THE FINEST': ARRESTING APPROACH TO COP-ACTION FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even though "The Last of the Finest" opened citywide last Friday without 
benefit of press previews the fact that Brian Dennehy was billed above its 
title was encouraging. As it turns out, it's a terrific cop-action picture, 
imaginative and entertaining, that could have benefited from opening-day 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Dennehy, one of those natural actors whose every look, gesture 
and movement is expressive, it has that rarity for a cop picture, an 
exceptional script (by Jere Cunningham with Thomas Lee Wright and George 
Armitage) so strong in characterization that it's not necessary to explain the 
plot, as intricate as it is. It suffices to say that Dennehy and his 
underground LAPD squad (Joe Pantoliano, Jeff Fahey and Bill Paxton) find 
themselves taking the law into their own hands in trying to nail a major drug 
ring and wind up unexpectedly confronted with having to make some crucial moral 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are Dennehy et al convincing as cops, they and their families also 
come across as people first and foremost. Indeed, it's because we come to know 
them so well that we can accept Dennehy's decision to turn vigilante and not 
regard it as mere fantasy. For that matter, the film's basic material could 
scarcely seem more familiar. It becomes fresh because the people, Dennehy's 
Frank Daly especially, have such dimension, plus the provocative suggestion 
that drug trafficking and extreme right wing politics are not necessarily such 
strange bedfellows. 
</P>
<P>
"The Last of the Finest" also deals forthrightly with the terrible temptation 
that police face with the enormous sums of money connected with narcotics. 
Also, if there's plenty of action and some credible and tragic violence, 
there's also some humor. (Somehow it's gratifying to learn that Frank Daly can 
get fed up with David Letterman.) 
</P>
<P>
While "The Last and the Finest" has a first-rate script and cast (which 
includes Deborra-Lee Furness as Dennehy's staunch, very real wife, and John 
Finnegan and Ford Rainey in nifty character turns), it is John Mackenzie's 
assured, driving and lusty direction that makes it all work. (Mackenzie, after 
all, directed that modern gangster movie classic, "The Long Good Friday" with 
Bob Hoskins). Making everything look great -- including Larry Paull's spot-on 
production design, is cinematographer Juan Ruiz-Anchia's beautifully lit L.A. 
locales -- some of which are actually unfamiliar.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: UCLA UNEARTHS RAY'S NEGLECTED 'ON DANGEROUS GROUND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In addition to the constant flow of retrospectives and series, the UCLA Film 
Archive from time to time dips into its vaults to present a double feature just 
for the fun of it. Tuesday's offering (at 8 p.m. in Melnitz Theater) is a pair 
of obscure 1951 films noir by two celebrated directors, Nicholas Ray and E. A. 
Dupont. 
</P>
<P>
The first, Ray's "On Dangerous Ground," is a revelation, an unjustly neglected 
stunner, while the second, Dupont's "The Scarf," is an entertaining curiosity. 
Both films have their seedy nighttime city streets with their cheap bars, yet 
both are set mainly in isolated rural areas, atypical for the film noir with 
its signature flashing neon glare. Their pristine prints remind us how glorious 
black-and-white could be. 
</P>
<P>
Considering Ray's cult status, it is mystifying that "On Dangerous Ground," 
which he and A. I. Bezzerides adapted from Gerald Butler's novel "Mad With Much 
Heart," is not as well-known as such other Ray films noir as "They Live by 
Night" (1948) and "In a Lonely Place" (1950). Working with two virtuosos, 
cinematographer George E. Diskant and the great film composer Bernard Herrmann, 
Ray hurtles us into the alienated world of a big-city police detective (Robert 
Ryan), a loner so embittered by 11 years on the force that he's beginning to 
undermine his effectiveness by his increasingly violent physical abuse of 
suspects. Eager to get him out of town for awhile, his chief (Ed Begley) gives 
him a lecture and sends him to the snowy countryside to help track down the 
unknown killer of a young girl. 
</P>
<P>
"On Dangerous Ground" develops into a confrontation, as unexpected for us as it 
is for the detective himself, between two very different kinds of lonely 
people: a rage-filled city man who trusts no one and a gentle country woman 
(Ida Lupino) who, because of her near-total blindness, feels she must trust 
everyone. The impact of Lupino upon Ryan is dizzying, and because Ray is 
working with people as talented as he is, he manages a shift from violence and 
anger to love and tenderness with an effect that is at once convincing and 
profoundly romantic. 
</P>
<P>
From start to finish, the film is breathtakingly dynamic, so much so that it 
seems amazingly fresh for all its genre conventions. The subtlety, richness and 
poignancy of Herrmann's score makes it easy to understand why it is said that 
he considered it his favorite. 
</P>
<P>
If "On Dangerous Ground" is a major discovery, "The Scarf" is at least a 
fascinating minor work by the director of "Variety" (1925), a landmark in the 
German Expressionist cinema, and the lesser-known but dazzling British-made 
"Piccadilly" (1929), with Cyril Ritchard, Gilda Gray, Anna May Wong and Charles 
Laughton. 
</P>
<P>
"The Scarf," which Dupont wrote as well as directed, is surprisingly verbose 
for a director who began in silents. In any event, it is a highly contrived 
tale that finds an amnesiac convict (John Ireland) escaping from a prison for 
the criminally insane in an attempt to discover whether he really strangled his 
sweetheart or not. He's given shelter by a crusty desert hermit (James Barton). 
The film reflects the postwar fascination with psychiatric theory, then applied 
very literally -- at least on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Ireland manages to stay natural, and there's enough of the flavorful 
Barton presence -- usually his screen appearances were briefer than here -- to 
give us an idea of what his Hickey in the original production of "The Iceman 
Cometh" must have been like. Mercedes McCambridge and Emlyn Williams are 
another matter, however. McCambridge is extravagantly miscast, truly terrible 
and a total camp as a tough singing bar waitress -- "Detour's" Ann Savage might 
just have gotten away with the role. Williams is painfully obvious as an 
insinuating psychologist obsessed with feathers; incredibly, he and Ireland 
were originally set to play each other's role. Information: (213) 206-FILM, 
206-8013. 
</P>
<P>
"Evangelust," veteran independent film maker George Kuchar's outrageous, 
35-minute 1987 spoof of Tammy and Jim Bakker, will be presented Friday and 
Saturday at 8 p.m. at EZTV, 8547 Santa Monica Blvd., with Kuchar in attendance. 
It's Kuchar's proven mix of sweaty sex and scatological humor, the right 
approach to people who are already caricatures. Information: (213) 657-1532.

RAVEL AND RICHARD STRAUSS BY RIVERSIDE ORCHESTRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now in the midst of its 31st season, the Riverside County Philharmonic has had 
a recent change of fortune along with its change of name -- until a year ago, 
it was called the Riverside Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime observers of the local musical scene have noted that, with the advent 
of Patrick Flynn as music director in 1988-89, the orchestra has taken on a new 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
This with only a handful of personnel changes in an already professional 
ensemble that plays together fewer than a dozen times a season and operates on 
a modest $230,000. 
</P>
<P>
New or just refurbished, that perspective was on view at the third concert of 
the season, Saturday night in historic, acoustically variable Municipal 
Auditorium, in downtown Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn, a native of England who has served as principal conductor for American 
Ballet Theatre and in operatic posts in Australia and symphonic directorships 
on this continent, is a dynamic podium personality without being a 
grandstander. 
</P>
<P>
His lively performances have a conviction and tautness that compel. Saturday, 
with his own orchestra, he achieved a high level of communication. 
</P>
<P>
Most impressively, he drew from the 75-member orchestra the kind of polished, 
transparent, sweeping and subtle performance of Ravel's Second "Daphnis et 
Chloe" Suite. 
</P>
<P>
In "Daphnis," as in Richard Strauss' seldom-heard first tone poem, "Macbeth," 
and Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto, the orchestra responded thoroughly to 
Flynn's ministrations in favor of stylistic contrasts, self-listening, pointed 
solo lines and the broad musical arch. Certain first-desk and sectional 
weaknesses aside -- the lower strings need beefing up, for instance -- this 
orchestra deserves its growing reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Soloist in the Prokofiev concerto was a gifted youngster, Aika Nishi, who won 
this appearance in the 1989 Joanna Hodges International Competition; Nishi met 
all the digital requirements in the piece but not its coloristic ones. DANIEL 
CARIAGA

PEHLIVANIAN LEADS FORMER MATES IN BEETHOVEN 7TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the heat of a musical performance could be measured by some objective means 
-- using a kind of musical thermometer -- the reading for George Pehlivanian's 
account of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre would be 
a good 150 Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
The young conductor certainly worked up quite a sweat Saturday evening, jumping 
and jabbing in order to coax 65 members of the American Youth Symphony to bring 
the familiar work as much fire and as much volume as they could muster. 
</P>
<P>
But loudness is not the same as intensity. Pehlivanian made every fortissimo 
sound the same, while failing to imbue the soft passages with any sense of 
tension, making it impossible for the listener to perceive any unfolding drama. 
Moreover, technical imperfections continually dogged this reading. 
</P>
<P>
Before intermission, Pehlivanian led the orchestra in Richard Yardumian's 
Chorale Prelude "Ee Kerezman" (Resurrection). Readily accessible, 
orchestrationally conventional and harmonically tame, the 10-minute modal 
composition proved disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
The former AYS concertmaster had been scheduled to perform the Mendelssohn 
Violin Concerto, but reportedly had developed tendinitis. Instead, violin in 
hand, he led his former colleagues in a muscular, unsubtle account of Mozart's 
"Eine kleine Nachtmusik." TERRY McQUILKIN

GUITARIST SCOTT TENNANT IN RECITAL AT USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With skill and an unusual sweet-tooth for flashy, ebullient music, guitarist 
Scott Tennant presented an impressive, sometimes dazzling recital Saturday 
evening at Hancock Auditorium, USC. His virtuosic playing includes an 
exceptional right-hand agility and a remarkable fluidity in difficult passages. 
</P>
<P>
Although he generally kept his penchant for showiness under control, this 
temptation often ran slightly unbounded, showing up considerably but not 
distastefully in works like Giuliani's "Grand Overture." Similarly, Tennant 
treated the accessible, sugary consonances in four pieces by John Dowland with 
an overflowing amount of sentimentality. 
</P>
<P>
Two purely tonal contemporary works followed the same path: Carlo Domeniconi's 
Oriental-sounding "Variations on a Turkish Theme" hauntingly sang and twanged, 
while Andrew York's New Age folk study "Emergence" resonated pleasantly though 
it is more a sketch than a complete composition. 
</P>
<P>
Fleshing out the program were more routine but convincing performances of four 
Etudes by Villa-Lobos, Rodrigo's "Sonata Giocosa" and a transcription of Bach's 
Suite in E for solo violin. GREGG WAGER

DIANE SCHUUR'S SET IS SOLID, BUT SHE'S NO TRAILBLAZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though the program notes were the work of publicists, there's still something 
unsettling about claims that so liberally compare a singer like Diane Schuur to 
the likes of Billie, Ella, Sarah, Dinah and Aretha after lauding her as being 
"among the great song interpreters of our day." 
</P>
<P>
While she works from the same repertoire as many of the above singers (Aretha 
Franklin being the obvious exception), Schuur, who performed a one-nighter at 
El Camino College Saturday night, lacks the originality of Billie, the 
oh-so-natural swing of Ella, the pure vocal chops of Sarah and the earthiness 
of Dinah. 
</P>
<P>
Those things considered, Schuur's two-set concert before a packed auditorium, 
while certainly not unpleasant, was hardly the trail-blazing experience hoped 
for. 
</P>
<P>
Working from behind the piano, and supported by a trio led by synthesist Randy 
Porter and featuring drummer John Guerin and bassist Bob Magnusson, Schuur 
breezed through a nine-tune opening set of formulized standards (open with a 
fast one, throw in a couple of ballads, end with a blues) that failed to 
demonstrate any departure from the norm. 
</P>
<P>
Schuur has a solid alto voice with a tightly controlled vibrato that she would 
do well to stay with. Without exception, every tune during her concert featured 
a moment or two when she would effect a back-of-the-throat falsetto scream 
whose intonation was so faulty as to deserve a key change. 
</P>
<P>
When she wasn't impersonating Minnie Ripperton, Schuur demonstrated a good 
feeling for the blues ("High Powered Mama"), bop (her scat vocals and piano 
solos on "Scrapple From the Apple" were impressive) and the ballad (a slow 
rendition of "Come Rain or Come Shine" and "See You With my Heart" were 
terrific). A. JAMES LISKA

BASEBALL LOCKOUT STRIKES OUT ON TALK RADIO; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: THE SHOWS ARE DELUGED WITH CALLS BUT INTEREST WANES WITH TOO MUCH 
DISCUSSION OF ONE SUBJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In place of the "what do you think of the Dodgers/Angels" questions about the 
teams and their athletes, the Southland's radio sports talk shows have been 
dominated for several weeks by discussions of Major League Baseball's spring 
training lockout. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Olden of KMPC-AM (710) estimates that in recent days 70% of the calls to 
his sports show have dealt with the lockout. Larry King, who hosts a 
general-interest talk show on Mutual Radio, said that about 20% of his calls 
lately have concerned the labor dispute -- twice as many as he usually gets on 
sports topics. 
</P>
<P>
Too many calls on one subject can lead to bad radio, King says. 
</P>
<P>
"Good talk radio is different avenues of thought," said King, whose show is 
heard locally on KFI-AM (640). "If you have too much of the same, listeners 
think, 'Here we go again.' When callers are ill-informed and you get the same 
pap, it loses me as a listener." 
</P>
<P>
Olden agrees. If a settlement is not reached soon, he plans to broaden his show 
so that it is not monopolized by lockout-related calls. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be calling some managers and players to preview the coming 
season, and despite what anybody thinks, there will be a season," Olden said. 
"I've also been recommending the listeners read certain baseball magazines so 
they can read about baseball and not labor disputes." 
</P>
<P>
Hosts and callers more familiar with wins and losses have had problems 
discussing the complexities of labor negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The most common faux pas is terming the current situation a strike. It is a 
lockout by the owners; Don Fehr, executive director of the Major League Players 
Assn., has asked for the camps to be opened. Another misstatement frequently 
heard is that the dispute is over player salaries. In fact, it is over a 
collective bargaining agreement. Other calls complain that baseball players 
have no right to a union. The Wagner Act passed by Congress in 1935 guarantees 
all workers the right to union representation. 
</P>
<P>
Opinions vary on whether the responsibility for these errors lies with the 
hosts or the callers. 
</P>
<P>
King puts the blame on the person at the mike. 
</P>
<P>
"If the host is uninformed, the caller reflects the host," said King, who also 
hosts a call-in show on Cable News Network. "This is the kind of subject you 
have to know about. It's more than just millionaires having a fight. There is a 
long history of mistrust of the owners. Too many hosts are taking stands 
without knowledge of baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Olden cites fans' emotions as the reason behind their misstatements. 
</P>
<P>
"I still get a lot of calls saying they want to talk about the 'strike,' " 
Olden said. "I take great pains trying to explain the definition of what's 
going on, but at this point a lot of the audience isn't in the mood for 
rational explanations. What's said goes in one ear and out the other." 
</P>
<P>
King said he senses frustration among his callers. 
</P>
<P>
"People are missing the game," he said. "Baseball is the fabric of American 
sport. When your fabric gets taken away, it's sort of that comfort zone that 
isn't there. It's certainly not the end of world, but there is a part missing." 
</P>
<P>
Past surveys have indicated that unionization and work stoppages by 
professional athletes have been met with hostility by fans, even union members, 
who have backed the owners in disputes. 
</P>
<P>
"The audience still equates their salaries and benefits to the players'," Olden 
said. "That is the totally wrong thing to do because sports is so separate from 
reality that it is not a fair comparison. Fans are just angry because they want 
their entertainment and don't want to hear about labor problems from people 
making $3 million a year." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Bieler of KABC-AM (790), better known as "Superfan," believes fans' 
traditional feelings are a result of media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"The owners have the press boxes, free food and outlets who cover them and 
(thus they) are able to get the story out," Bieler said. "The athletes have a 
difficult time getting their story out." 
</P>
<P>
KFI's Joe McDonnell, who has covered Major League Baseball as a radio network 
sports reporter for a decade, has relied on his extensive ties to players for 
guests on his show, including Mike Scioscia, Matt Young and Tim Leary. He said 
that he has also invited Dodger owner Peter O'Malley and Executive Vice 
President Fred Claire on the show to give their viewpoints, but both have 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell said that his callers are essentially split between backing the 
owners and players. 
</P>
<P>
"Our callers understand both sides," McDonnell said. "What I've tried to do is 
educate people and give them facts on what's going on. I may be slanted towards 
the players because I think they're being wronged. I've been hammering that 
this is a lockout, not a strike, and that the owners have done this to the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell blames the owners for the current impasse. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a situation they've been planning for years," McDonnell said. "They 
have a strike fund between $100-$200 million. They were hoping from the start 
that they'd break the union. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost a direct result of what's happened with the presidential 
administrations since 1981. The country is in a very anti-union mood and the 
owners are trying to perpetrate that."

KID BEAT: 'ROBINSON AND CRUSOE': TIMELY ABSURDIST FABLE AT BARNSDALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two men are adrift on a rooftop in the ocean. They are strangers to each other 
who speak different languages -- hostile and wary men in military fatigues, 
from different countries. 
</P>
<P>
Survival depends on their ability to communicate, to work together. Will they? 
</P>
<P>
With slapstick humor and poignancy, "Robinson and Crusoe," a timely absurdist 
fable for children at Barnsdall Art Park's Gallery Theatre, reveals the 
superficiality of sociological barriers to human connection. 
</P>
<P>
Written by Nino D'Introna and Giacomo Ravicchio and originally produced by 
Italy's youth theater Teatro dell'Angolo, this new English adaptation is by 
playwright Shem Bitterman. It is directed by Peter C. Brosius, and performed by 
the Mark Taper Forum's professional youth theater company, the Improvisation 
Theatre Project. 
</P>
<P>
Cast members Jerry Tondo (as the American) and Valente Rodriguez (speaking a 
doctored Andean Indian dialect) execute their intensely physical roles and 
their quiet moments with conviction. After one onstage scuffle, a young boy in 
the audience asked, "Are they ever going to trust each other?" When the men 
stopped fighting, the boy said: "They understand now." 
</P>
<P>
Though the message is powerful, its delivery is somewhat compromised. An 
intense scene in the middle shifts the balance of the play; it takes awhile to 
regain its rhythm. And, while set designer Richard Hoover's shingled roof is 
boldly realized, the suggestion of ocean surrounding it is ineffective. Staging 
that takes place on the back of the roof, or actually in the "ocean," looks the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
Still, this is superior youth theater, both in subject and performance. 
Margaret Anne Dunn contributes evocative lighting design; Kathleen Waln did the 
realistic costumes. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is free at 4800 Hollywood Blvd. Saturdays at 11 a.m., through March. 
Then the show reopens (with paid admission) April 10-21 at the Taper Too. 
Tickets: (213) 972-7337.

STRONG DEMAND FOR 'THE LITTLE MERMAID' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
You won't have to wait until the next decade to see Disney's smash-hit animated 
feature, "The Little Mermaid," on videocassette. Its home-video debut will be 
considerably sooner -- May 18. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other Disney animated features, it will be available at a price geared 
to sales: $26.99. The price will be slashed three dollars with a rebate from 
Disney. Discount stores, though, will probably sell it for $15 to $18. 
</P>
<P>
Standard Disney policy has been to put its animated films through several 
theatrical releases over a period of years. In addition to increasing its 
exposure to young audiences, this extended release pattern also beefs up the 
gross, further enhancing the movie's appeal in the home-video market. 
</P>
<P>
Since it came out last November, "Mermaid" has grossed more than $76 million, 
the most any animated film has earned in its initial release. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed likely that "Little Mermaid" wouldn't come out on home video until 
long after the debuts of two other animated features, "The Great Mouse 
Detective" (1986) and "Oliver and Co." (1988). Why did "Mermaid" leap-frog over 
them in the home-video release line? 
</P>
<P>
The reason was spectacular marketing research results, explained Richard Cohen, 
senior vice president of Buena Vista Home Video, the parent company of Disney 
Home Video. 
</P>
<P>
"The initial exit (from theaters) research was astounding," he said. "People 
said they were anxious to buy it and that they'd buy it any time of the year. 
The intent-to-purchase figures were so high and so much in favor of putting it 
out as soon as possible that we eventually decided to put it out for the summer 
market." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen also said that there would be no commercial on "Little Mermaid." Some 
potential sponsors wanted to buy a spot on the cassette, but ads on animated 
features are against company policy, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the decision to put "Mermaid" out so soon has to do with the notion, 
which surfaced last year, that the home-video sales market is lucrative 
year-round, not only in the Christmas-holiday gift-buying season. The release 
in early February of "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" and "Lethal Weapon 2" 
-- both at $24.98, geared to the sales market -- tested the sales market 
outside the holiday season, with mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
According to various industry estimates, Disney should ship between 6 million 
and 10 million copies of "Mermaid." Eventually it may surpass "Bambi," Disney's 
best-seller at 10.5 million copies. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Disney pulls a feature-length animated feature from its vaults 
for Christmas home-video release. Earlier in the year, that movie gets its 
final theatrical re-release, partly to reacquaint audiences with the title. But 
Cohen said that the release of "Little Mermaid" didn't preclude the company 
putting out another animated feature on home video this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The most likely candidate for fall release is "Peter Pan," with "Snow White and 
the Seven Dwarfs" also a strong possibility.

The day had long since given way to darkness at the Raymond Rosen project, 
causing the rows of two-story brick houses to appear even more gloomy and the 
high-rise flats even more scary. But there is an even greater darkness that 
lives in this project, one that has nothing to do with time but the stifling of 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
In an upstairs bedroom of one of these houses, Aaron Kevin Crump was peacefully 
asleep when his father, Hank Gathers, collapsed while playing basketball last 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, he would be awakened by his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
"Grandma came upstairs and woke me up and told me that Dad had been a little 
bit sick, and he was dead," said Aaron, 6. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I said, 'He can't be dead.' Then I just started crying. Then Grandma 
said I should come downstairs and help Mom quit crying, so I did." 
</P>
<P>
Aaron went downstairs and watched the television replay of Gathers' death. He 
saw his father collapse and go into convulsions. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like it when he fell," Aaron said, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I cry too, and Mom cried a lot. So when it comes on (the television) 
I say, 'Mom don't look at it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Marva Crump, Aaron's mother, says that Aaron has had little to say since his 
father's death. Instead, he has been writing letters to his father and drawing 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The letters vary and are usually written 'To Hank,' and to a few of Hank's 
friends. But the pictures Aaron draws are all the same. 
</P>
<P>
"Aaron's been drawing pictures of stick figures of himself, only he gives 
himself a heart," Crump said. 
</P>
<P>
On the chest of each stick figure, Aaron has drawn a Valentine heart and next 
to it has written, "This is me." This same stick figure is also on the bottom 
of his letters. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to make just stick figures, skinny ones," Aaron said. "But I love my 
dad and myself. I worry about both my heart and my dad's heart." 
</P>
<P>
In a cruel twist of fate, or perhaps genetics, Aaron also may have a heart 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Gathers will be buried today. He died from an apparent heart condition. 
First, there will be a ceremony at a Baptist church a few blocks from where 
Gathers grew up, and where his son still lives. Aaron, who was born to Gathers' 
and Marva Crump out of wedlock, might not be able to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Today is the day that Aaron learns if he has a heart problem. 
</P>
<P>
The funeral is at noon. Aaron's doctor appointment, made several weeks ago, is 
at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I took Aaron in for a regular check-up in February, and the doctor said he 
heard a second beat in Aaron's heart," said Crump, 25, with whom Aaron lives. 
"He called in three other doctors to listen. Then they sent me to a 
pediatrician, who sent me to a children's heart center. There, they did an 
electrocardiogram and told me Aaron had to wear a heart monitor for 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors asked Crump if she had any history of heart problems in her family. She 
told them her great-grandmother had died of a heart attack. She didn't know 
that Gathers, after fainting during a game Dec. 9, had been diagnosed as having 
an irregular heartbeat. Gathers never told her the diagnosis, only that he was 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
She also didn't know Gathers had to wear a heart monitor during basketball 
practice for a few weeks or that he was on medication. He never told her the 
details, even though they talked frequently by phone. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time Hank was trying not to worry me about him, I was trying not 
to worry him about Aaron," Crump said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hank didn't tell me everything, because he wouldn't want to worry me or 
Aaron." 
</P>
<P>
And for those same reasons, Gathers never knew about the concern over his son's 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if they (doctors) say Aaron is fine, I'm going to stay on top of it," 
Crump said. "I'm not taking any chances, not after what happened to Hank. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to believe Hank was fine, but I don't think I ever really 
did." 
</P>
<P>
Marva Crump was 15 when she met Hank Gathers at the local project hangout. He 
was 13. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always a comedian, such a delight," she said. "He was always tall, so 
he was a basketball player. And he always said he was going to play basketball. 
I never doubted he would." 
</P>
<P>
Crump was 19 when she was pregnant with Aaron. She remembers that Gathers was 
at her side when their son was born, and that he continued to be there for both 
of them until he died. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers picked the name for his son, choosing Aaron because he thought it had a 
good ring to it. 
</P>
<P>
"In the hospital Hank kept repeating, 'Aaron, Aaron, it rhymes with Hank -- 
Hank Aaron,' " said Phyllis Crump, Marva's mother. Marva, Aaron and Marva's 
other son, Chris, 3, live with Phyllis Crump. 
</P>
<P>
When Aaron was 2, Gathers went away to college at USC. He and Crump had broken 
off their relationship, but Gathers never stopped being a father. He continued 
to call Aaron, and would take him with him whenever he returned to 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Aaron saw his father was when Gathers came to Philadelphia in 
January for Loyola's games against St. Joseph and La Salle. He took Aaron to 
both games and spent the off-day with him. It was Gathers' hope that after he 
became a first-round pick in this year's NBA draft that Aaron would come and 
live with him. 
</P>
<P>
"After Hank and I broke up, nobody knew how we felt," Crump said. "We remained 
good friends, special friends, and I wanted him to take Aaron to live with him. 
But it's not because it's a ticket out of here. I wanted Aaron to go with Hank 
because they loved each other so much. I wanted that for Aaron and Hank." 
</P>
<P>
Not only would Gathers buy presents for Aaron, but he also acted as a father to 
Crump's other son, Chris. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have to do that, but he did," Crump said. "He also wanted Chris to 
feel good, so he would bring him presents and spend time with him. That's just 
the kind of guy Hank is." 
</P>
<P>
Chris believes Hank is his father. 
</P>
<P>
"Someday when he gets older, we'll let him know the real story," Phyllis Crump 
said. "But for now, he's too young and wouldn't understand." 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Crump says she feels a little slighted for Aaron since Gathers died. 
She says Gathers never tried to hide the fact that he had a son, and yet, until 
a Beverly Hills attorney announced his plans to sue on behalf of the Gathers 
family, there had been little mention of Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
Through Saturday, only Derrick Gathers, Hank's brother, has come over to see 
how Aaron is doing. No one else from the Gathers' family has even called. 
Phyllis and Marva Crump don't understand why. Lucille Gathers, Hank's mother, 
has always been close to the Crumps. 
</P>
<P>
"Lucille is good to Aaron," Phyllis said. Marva agrees. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Phyllis wishes that there would have been more references to Gathers as 
a good father after he died. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a friend call today and say, 'Hey, I read where you are suing over 
Hank's death,' " Phyllis said. "I didn't know anything about that. It just 
seems sad to me that when Aaron is mentioned, it's in a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, Hank was a great basketball player, and a great person. But he was also 
a terrific father, and nobody is mentioning that." 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis was referring to reports that a lawsuit will be filed this week against 
Loyola Marymount University and possibly the doctors who treated Gathers. 
</P>
<P>
Father David Hagan, a close friend of the Gathers family, has been the driving 
force behind the suit. He has said that it was Gathers' dream to succeed as a 
professional basketball player so he could care for his family, most of whom 
still live in the north Philadelphia inner-city neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
It's just another Saturday night at the Raymond Rosen project. The name of this 
place sounds planned, but one has to wonder how any place like this could be 
built on purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Chain-link fencing surround the low-income housing, attempting to separate the 
dirt lawns from the grimy sidewalks, the residents from the drug users and the 
drunks who litter the area. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street, patrons of the neighborhood deli spill onto the narrow road, 
their voices loud and haughty. A turquoise Plymouth blocks traffic. Nearby, 
policeman sit silently in a patrol car, waiting for a reason to sound. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the fence, neighbors hang out of their second-story windows to chat with 
those below, while teen-agers cluster beneath a row of empty clotheslines and 
just hang out. 
</P>
<P>
This is where Hank Gathers grew up. It's where his mother still lives, just 
around the corner from the Crumps. 
</P>
<P>
"When Hank visited Los Angeles on his first recruiting visit to USC, he asked 
me to take him to Watts," said David Spencer, the assistant basketball coach at 
USC who recruited Gathers. 
</P>
<P>
"So I drove him there. But he thought I was joking. He said, 'C'mon Spence, I 
want to see Watts.' I said, 'Hank, I'm telling you this is Watts.' He couldn't 
believe it. To him, it looked like a suburb, a lower-middle class 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
When Phyllis Crump moved to the project in 1964, she had to live in the 
high-rise flats, located next to the rowhouses. 
</P>
<P>
"Water dripping from the ceiling, it's terrible," she said. "That's where 
Lucille (Gathers) was when she first moved here, and I got her into a home like 
ours. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody should have to live like that in the high rise. It used to be you could 
leave your door open. But now you can't even go over there without getting 
mugged or killed." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the Crumps' house, though, it's a different story. Pictures and trophies 
of Philip Crump, a standout high school basketball player now at San Jose 
State, line the bookshelves in the dining room. The furniture, though sparse, 
is neat and clean. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere is warm and comfortable. Phyllis Crump is an attractive, 
articulate woman. Marva, who works full-time for a security firm, is patient 
and kind. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron, dressed neatly in a polo shirt and jeans, brings out his book of letters 
and pictures that he has written and drawn for his dad since Gathers' death. 
</P>
<P>
From aaron. march 5, 1990 
</P>
<P>
 How do I love? 
</P>
<P>
 I love hank and

<P>
 I love bo and

<P>
 I love Tom 
</P>
<P>
 the End. 
</P>
<P>
 Sub is his uncle Philip. Bo Kimble was Gathers' teammate and best friend, and 
Tom Peabody was another Loyola teammate. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron mixes his references to Gathers -- sometimes he's Hank, sometimes Dad. 
Usually he calls him Hank when he refers to basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, do you know if, when Hank died, did they win the game?" Aaron asks. 
</P>
<P>
His attention span waning, Aaron leaves the adults sitting on the couch and 
starts playing with his brother, Chris. He picks up his junior basketball and 
shoots it around. Then he puts on a skate and glides about the black tile 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, he climbs back on his mother's lap and listens as she talks of her 
friend, Hank. Of how good he was to Aaron. Of how much she will miss him. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron sees the tears start to form in his mother's eyes. He leans back on her 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has to go sometime," he tells his mom. "Everybody. One day you will 
have to go, too. Then you'll get to talk to Hank again." 
</P>
<P>
Aaron put on his tuxedo Sunday and went with his grandmother to view his 
father's body at the church. 
</P>
<P>
He stood next to the open casket, and stared at his dad. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want my dad to die," he told his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Then one of Aaron's uncles picked him up so he could kiss his father. Aaron 
stiffened a little. 
</P>
<P>
On the way home in the car, Aaron began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him, 'Aaron, where is your father now?' " Phyllis Crump said. "And 
Aaron said, 'He's in my heart, Grandma, he's in my heart.' "

SENNA WINS DUEL WITH ALESI AT PHOENIX

<P>
Ayrton Senna beat his fellow Formula One drivers, who put on one of their 
better shows Sunday in the second Iceberg USA Grand Prix through the streets of 
downtown Phoenix. But hardly anyone was there to see it. 
</P>
<P>
Only an estimated 15,000 were on hand on a cold, blustery day for the opening 
round of the 16-race world championship season. 
</P>
<P>
Senna, the brilliant Brazilian who has been the center of controversy since the 
end of last season, won the 72-lap race in a new Honda-powered McLaren. But not 
before he struggled through a tense duel with Jean Alesi, a youthful Frenchman 
in a Tyrrell Ford, driving in only his eighth Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
After Alesi had led the first 33 laps -- the first time he had ever been at the 
front of a Formula One race -- he and Senna put on a back-to-back pass on lap 
34 that will be talked about for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
Senna, who had stalked Alesi for 10 laps, noted that he had been taking a wide 
line through the first turn after the pit straight, so Senna ducked inside to 
get the lead. But Alesi stayed on the power and charged down the short 
block-long stretch in front of an old brick fire station and passed Senna. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly didn't expect Alesi to go round the outside of me when I got 
inside him," Senna said. 
</P>
<P>
A lap later, Senna repeated his pass and blocked Alesi from making a second 
daring move. From then, the race was only a question of nothing happening to 
Senna or his red and white car. 
</P>
<P>
"I had waited for some time to make my pass, and when I did I was surprised 
when I saw Alesi right there next to me," Senna said. "I knew if I closed the 
door on him, we would both wreck, so I had to open and let him go. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very exciting, a good clean pass when we were both driving to the 
limit. Those are the situations I like. They are the reasons I chose this as my 
profession." 
</P>
<P>
Alesi, who had qualified third, got a jump at the start that carried him past 
the front row pair of Gerhard Berger of Austria, Senna's McLaren teammate; and 
Pierluigi Martini of Italy, the surprise of qualifying in a Minardi Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Once away from the pack, Alesi built an eight-second lead over Senna after 
Berger had ended his hopes of winning by spinning into a tire well and damaging 
the rear wing on his McLaren. 
</P>
<P>
Then Senna's McLaren set out after Alesi's blue and white car. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I was not so concerned with Alesi because I believed he would have 
to stop for tires and I knew that I would not," Senna said. "Once I realized he 
was not going to stop, I pushed very hard to catch him, and he responded by 
pushing very hard, too. 
</P>
<P>
"He drove a fantastic race, and it wasn't until he lost some time in traffic 
that I was able to close up behind him. I know that we will have many more 
close races in the season." 
</P>
<P>
Alesi, who drove in his first Grand Prix less than a year ago, was almost as 
excited about racing with Senna as he was about his second-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
"Only three years ago, when I was driving in Formula Three and he was driving 
for Lotus, Ayrton was my hero," Alesi revealed. "For me, it was incredible to 
be racing with him. My only thought was to try and drive to my maximum and see 
what would happen." 
</P>
<P>
Only five drivers finished on the lead lap, with Thierry Boutsen of Belgium 
third in a Williams Renault, former world champion Nelson Piquet of Brazil 
fourth in a Bennetton Ford, and Stefano Modena of Italy fifth in a Brabham 
Ford. Satoru Nakajima, Alesi's Tyrrell teammate, was a lap down, but he got the 
sixth and final point in the Grand Prix standings. 
</P>
<P>
The Ferraris of Alain Prost, who left McLaren after winning his third world 
championship last year, and Nelson Mansell both dropped out with sick engines. 
Prost was the first to go after his rear end began to smoke as early as the 
fourth lap. 
</P>
<P>
Mansell's retirement was more spectacular. After patiently working his way up 
from his starting position of 18th to fifth, he had set out after Piquet when 
his car belched a huge puff of smoke that was followed by a ball of fire from 
the rear of the Ferrari. Mansell spun in his oil and pulled off course, his day 
done. 
</P>
<P>
Senna drove the 72 laps, or 169.9 miles, at an average speed of 90.586 m.p.h. 
Prost won last year's inaugural Phoenix race at 87.370. The faster speed was 
largely attributed to the 40-degree shift in temperature, from last June's 100 
to Sunday's 60 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I am quite surprised to win the first race in a new car on such a demanding 
circuit," Senna said. "We only tested the car two weeks ago in Portugal and the 
test did not go too well. Then we had problems in the engine Friday that caused 
me to have my poorest starting position since mid-1988." 
</P>
<P>
The win was the 21st for Senna since driving his first race in 1984 in his 
native Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Berger, after returning to the course five laps behind the leaders, posted the 
day's fastest lap of 93.311 m.p.h. in mid-race. 
</P>
<P>
But Alesi's spectacular driving had veteran observers buzzing along pit row. 
</P>
<P>
Alesi, 25, made his Grand Prix debut last year in France after Michele Alboreto 
quit the Tyrrell team. He responded by finishing fourth after holding down 
second place for a time. 
</P>
<P>
"It all happened so quickly for me," Alesi recalled. "I had not even time for a 
fitting. I was using a padded version of Alboreto's seat, and I wasn't 
comfortable, so Ken (Tyrrell, the team owner) told me he wouldn't judge me on 
one race. After the race, he was very calm. He just told me I'd better get 
myself to England to have a proper seat made." 
</P>
<P>
Later, to prove it was no fluke, Alesi came back to finish fifth at Monza and 
fourth in Spain, ending the championship season in ninth place having competed 
in only half the races.

They call him Conan the Destroyer and his appetite is legend. He's Brian 
Conlan, an all-star offensive lineman from South Delta High School in Delta, 
British Columbia. He's headed for the University of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Says Conlan: "One time my mom cooked this big roast chicken and set it down on 
the table. Boy, was she surprised when I ate the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
His mother then watched him go through several helpings of rice, pasta and 
bread, all washed down with a quart of milk. 
</P>
<P>
Says Washington Coach Don James: "Obviously what we like about him is that he 
doesn't have to get a whole lot bigger."

Conlan is 6-5 and 285.

Yuk, yuk: Bob Weiss, assistant coach of the Orlando Magic, was a teammate of 
Utah Coach Jerry Sloan when Sloan was named to six All-NBA defensive teams 
while playing with the Chicago Bulls. Weiss said Sloan, in his prime, could 
handle Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Really? 
</P>
<P>
"Of course." Weiss said. "Jordan would have been 12 then." 
</P>
<P>
Add Jordan: Asked after the last Chicago-Boston game if he thought Larry Bird 
had lost a step, he did a double-take and said, "He scored 38." 
</P>

Trivia time: What do Arnold Palmer, Hugh McElhenny and Elvis Presley have in 
common? Historic shot: Adding to his accomplishments on the tour, Gary Player 
the golf architect says, "I was the first golfer to hit a ball over the River 
Kwai." 
</P>
<P>
Player told the Atlanta Journal that he's building his own bridge across the 
river in Thailand where Alec Guiness and William Holden emoted so brilliantly 
in the movie, "Bridge Over the River Kwai." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, by the way, the shot carries 120 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Homebody: The most productive player in baseball? How about Bip Roberts, 
utility man for the San Diego Padres? Last year, he scored 81 runs in only 329 
at-bats. Give him 600 at-bats and you get 148 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Golden harvest: The most productive draft in NFL history? How about 
Pittsburgh's in 1974? The Steelers landed Lynn Swann, Jack Lambert, John 
Stallworth and Mike Webster. 
</P>
<P>
He plays Bach, too: San Antonio Spur Coach Larry Brown, on David Robinson: 
"This is no ordinary kid. Asked why he blocked a shot, or defended a player so 
well, he says, 'Well, I couldn't let them drive the lane with impunity.' When 
was the last time you heard that?" 
</P>
<P>
Scavengers: Said football Coach Mike Kelly of Division III Dayton after the 
conclusion of Division I recruiting: "The big dogs finished eating. Now, we're 
out to pick at the bones." 
</P>
<P>
Never enough: Billie Jean King told the New York Times: "The only thing I 
regret is not making more money at the end of my career. One time I had some 
exhibitions lined up against Chris Evert at $100,000 a match, but Chris said 
she didn't want to lose to me in exhibitions at that stage of her career. I 
understood, but that would have been good money."

SABATINI OVERCOMES PRESSURE AND CAPRIATI;

TENNIS: IT'S NOT EASY, BUT ARGENTINE GETS PAST 13-YEAR-OLD IN THE FLORIDA 
FINAL, 6-4, 7-5.

Jennifer Capriati is only 13, but on Sunday she managed to put all the pressure 
on Gabriela Sabatini. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini was up to it, scoring a 6-4, 7-5 victory to win the Virginia Slims of 
Florida tournament, but she didn't seem to enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to be strong mentally to play against all the pressure I had to face 
today," Sabatini said. "I had to play my best tennis. I had to concentrate and 
play smart. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to finish the match and get out of this match today." 
</P>
<P>
Capriati, playing in her first professional tournament, rolled through five 
matches to reach the final, but couldn't get past the third-ranked women's 
player in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Not that it bothered her much. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this week was one of the greatest weeks in my life," Capriati said. 
"My first pro tournament and I got to the finals. I'm just so excited that I 
got this far." 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini won $70,000, while Capriati, who turns 14 later this month, won 
$28,000 as the youngest player to reach a major pro tournament final in the 
Open era that began in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike in her previous matches, Capriati couldn't come up with the winners when 
she needed them the most. Down a break of service, 3-2, in the first set, 
Capriati could only trade games with the stronger, more experienced Sabatini. 
</P>
<P>
With the Argentine on the brink of taking the first set at 5-4, Capriati was up 
love-30 -- two points from evening the set. 
</P>
<P>
But Sabatini held off the spirited Capriati and nailed down the set. 
</P>
<P>
It was more of the same in the second set. Capriati went up, 4-2, breaking 
Sabatini at love, but she couldn't hold it. Sabatini broke right back and then 
held for 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
At 5-5, Sabatini broke the youngster's serve to take a 6-5 lead before serving 
out the match. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati had a break point in the final game, but Sabatini fired a service 
winner to foil any comeback thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"She kept the rallies going," Capriati said. "She kept hitting those 
unbelievable dropshots . . . I think I got a little impatient."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clipper owner Donald Sterling adores the style -- and won-loss record -- of 
Coach Billy Tubbs of top-ranked Oklahoma. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It appears likely that Sterling will dismiss Don Casey at the end of the season 
and offer Tubbs a lucrative, multi-year contract to replace him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers' jinx notwithstanding, the job actually would be a plum. Perhaps 
no other team in the NBA has more outstanding young talent. And, if the draft 
were held today, the Clippers would own two lottery picks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tubbs, who took the Sooners to the NCAA championship game two years ago, has 
done his best coaching job this season with an inexperienced team and always 
has favored the run 'n gun NBA style of play. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The question remains whether the town would be big enough for both Tubbs and 
sound-alike Jack Nicholson, the famous Laker fan who also owns Clipper 
front-row season tickets. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Think the difference in political clout had something to do with Notre Dame 
making the NCAA tournament field and Cal State Long Beach not?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The snub doesn't figure to do much for Long Beach's chances of keeping Joe 
Harrington, its outstanding coach who has been interviewed by the University of 
Miami. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Final Four forecast: Oklahoma vs. Connecticut, Virginia vs. Arizona. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Nevada sports books cannot post odds on teams winning the tournament until 
Nevada Las Vegas is eliminated. Bets on events involving Nevada schools are 
illegal and a bet on another team in the tournament is construed as a bet 
against UNLV. . . . 
</P>
<P>
No UCLA or USC game was telecast here the first three days of the Pac-10 
tournament and the Bruins' championship game against Arizona was shown only on 
a delayed basis. No wonder so many local high school basketball stars, who want 
to be seen on TV, leave town. . . . 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Jim Harrick and Alabama-Birmingham's Gene Bartow will meet in the first 
round of the NCAA tournament Friday in Atlanta. But all four other coaches who 
have followed John Wooden at UCLA -- Gary Cunningham, Larry Brown, Larry Farmer 
and Walt Hazzard -- now are out of college basketball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Greg Foster, who lettered at UCLA in 1987 and then transferred to UTEP, was 
voted most valuable player of the WAC tournament. The Bruins could have used 
him at center this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
John Thompson showed again after Georgetown's loss to Connecticut in the Big 
East Conference semifinals that he is one of the few coaches in big-time 
college basketball who will give full credit to the winning team after a tough 
loss. He did the same thing after the Hoyas' loss to Villanova in the 1985 NCAA 
final. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In his NBA career, Magic Johnson never has gone through a season without 
missing a game. However, he's missed only one in 1989-90 and, as the Atlanta 
Hawks will attest, looks the picture of health. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Before thinking about Vlade Divac's chances of becoming NBA rookie of the year, 
remember that David Robinson is a rookie although he was drafted three years 
ago by the San Antonio Spurs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
With Robinson just beginning his career, why would even Larry Brown possibly 
consider leaving the Spurs?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Navy was 26-6 in Robinson's senior year and is 23-61 since. .. . 
</P>
<P>
John Salley should concentrate more on his basketball and less on his comedy 
routine. . . . Portland may not win the Pacific Division, but deserves some 
kind of crown for going 11-1 against the Atlantic Division. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Kings, famed for their giveaways this season, donated $136,000 
to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation after the recent Tip-A-King benefit. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Rogie Vachon's son Nicholas, who is too smart to play goal, has been awarded a 
hockey scholarship to Boston University. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Eastern bettors still refuse to give California-based thoroughbreds their due. 
Sunny Blossom, the Santa Anita track record holder at six furlongs, won a 
stakes at Aqueduct by 5 1/2 lengths Sunday and paid $9. . . . 
</P>
<P>
According to the latest weigh-ins, Raider Coach Art Shell has lost 18 pounds in 
the charity AFC vs. NFC Battle of the Bulge. He's down to 320, but San Diego 
Coach Dan Henning, down to 201, leads with a 21-pound loss. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I give 80% of the blame for the baseball lockout to the owners and 20% to the 
players. . . . 
</P>
<P>
No defeat by Pam Shriver should be called an upset. . . . 
</P>
<P>
News item: Jennifer Capriati, 13, loses to Gabriela Sabatini in finals of 
tennis tournament. Reaction: Must be burnout.

DePaul, snubbed by the NCAA tournament, was among the 32-team field selected 
for the National Invitation Tournament on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Demons (18-14) thought they might get picked for the NCAA tournament 
after beating Notre Dame for the second time on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make sense to me," DePaul Coach Joey Meyer said of the NCAA snub. 
"I can't explain why Notre Dame was selected over us. Maybe 14 losses had 
something to do with it, but teams with similar records were selected." 
</P>
<P>
The NIT starts Wednesday night with Marquette (15-13) at Penn State (21-8), 
Tennessee (15-13) at Memphis State (18-11) and New Orleans (19-10) at James 
Madison (20-10). 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, Massachusetts (17-13) is at Maryland (18-13), Baylor (16-13) 
at Mississippi State (15-13), Louisiana Tech (20-7) at Vanderbilt (16-14), 
Wisconsin Green Bay (21-7) at Southern Illinois (26-7), Stanford (18-11) at 
Hawaii (23-9), Tulsa (17-12) at Oklahoma State (16-13) and Southern (25-5) at 
Fordham (19-12). 
</P>

The first round concludes Friday night with Holy Cross (24-5) at Rutgers 
(16-16), Oregon (15-13) at New Mexico (17-12), Bowling Green (18-10) at 
Cincinnati (19-13), Kent State (21-7) at St. Louis (17-11) and Cal State Long

TWO WRONGS MAKE A RITE FOR BIG WEST

<P>
The Big West got cheated. 
</P>
<P>
Again. 
</P>
<P>
It's becoming such a regular event, the conference ought to schedule it on its 
yearly calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 15: Basketball media day. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 16: Conference season opens. 
</P>
<P>
 March 11: NCAA rip-off. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, New Mexico State was the Big West team left folded and swindled. 
Neil McCarthy's Aggies went 21-11, placed second behind Nevada Las Vegas, lost 
by six points to the Runnin' Rebels in the conference tournament final -- and 
went nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
This time around, Cal State Long Beach is the one pressing its nose against the 
NCAA's window, with nowhere to turn except the NIT. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers' credentials? 
</P>
<P>
A 22-8 record. 
</P>
<P>
A victory over Big 10 runner-up Purdue, which qualified for the NCAA field. 
</P>
<P>
A road victory over Texas, which qualified for the NCAA field. 
</P>
<P>
Two victories over New Mexico State, which finally qualified for the NCAA field 
but had to go 26-4 to do it. 
</P>
<P>
An appearance in the Big West Conference final against Las Vegas, where Long 
Beach lost on Sunday, 92-74. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for me to believe that there are 64 teams in the nation better than 
Long Beach," UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian said. 
</P>
<P>
At least no one can accuse the Big West of being paranoid anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the comments emanating from Kansas City on Sunday, the NCAA is out 
to get them. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jim Delany, chairman of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament 
Selection Committee, there was "concern . . . about the lateness of the 
championship games, especially in the Big Eight, Southeast Conference and Big 
West. These late games are playing havoc with the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee felt, 'Who should bear the burden?' Basically, we felt the Big 
West should bear the burden." 
</P>
<P>
In other words: We don't like you playing tournament championship games on 
Sunday afternoon, so we're going to make you pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA's response was to make a decision about the Big West's third 
representative -- Las Vegas and New Mexico State were already in -- by not 
making a decision. Instead, the berth became an either/or proposition, tossed 
into the unsuspecting lap of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Either Long Beach upsets Las Vegas Sunday, or UC Santa Barbara goes as the Big 
West's third team. 
</P>
<P>
"That's an easy cop-out," 49er Coach Joe Harrington said. "It comes down to us 
having to beat Las Vegas, a team that could very well win the national 
championship? That doesn't seem hardly fair. How about the other teams with 
worse records that made it?" 
</P>
<P>
How about it? 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (16-12) made it, but then Notre Dame has Digger and, in Delany's 
words, "two great wins over Syracuse and Missouri." Plus, a whopping 14 others. 
</P>
<P>
The Big West? In the eyes and minds of the NCAA selection committee, it's still 
a big joke. Pac-10 Jr. Nevada Las Vegas and the nine dwarves. 
</P>
<P>
That minor league outpost at the end of the college basketball world couldn't 
possibly have four teams worthy of consideration, could it? 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA figures it must deserve some kind of humanitarian award for tossing 
three invitations the Big West's way. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, ultimately, it did the Big West a disservice by dividing conference 
allegiance into two camps: Does Santa Barbara (20-8) deserve to go or does Long 
Beach? 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara has three significant victories -- one over UNLV and two very big 
ones over Long Beach -- but it also lugs three significant defeats. The Gauchos 
lost at home to a 5-23 UC Irvine team and lost twice to a 15-14 Pacific team, 
including Friday night in the Big West tournament quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, meanwhile, closed with nine victories in its last 10 games and 
upset regular-season conference champion New Mexico State in Saturday's 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't take care of business," Harrington said of Santa Barbara. "We did. 
They didn't win a game in the tournament. They lost to a lower seed. We won two 
games and beat the No. 1 seed. We took care of our business." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Big West must take care of business. Commissioner Jim Haney said 
Sunday the conference will have to rethink its expanded tournament format, 
which grew from four to five days this year to better accommodate the Big West 
women's field. Sunday, the women's final was held at Long Beach Arena, two 
hours before the 3 p.m. men's final. 
</P>
<P>
The results were larger crowds for both games -- and, the wrath of the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
"The message sent to us this day, just by wisdom and logic alone, makes us want 
to reassess where we are," Haney said. 
</P>
<P>
"Again, I may be biased, but I clearly believed we had four teams that deserved 
to be in the NCAAs. Whether or not we played on Sunday afternoon shouldn't 
factor into it." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Atlantic Coast Conference and Big East tournaments held their 
finals Sunday, too, and they weren't penalized. It's just those darn West Coast 
games. They always start so late.

UC SANTA BARBARA'S PIMM IS LEFT ROOTING FOR NEVADA LAS VEGAS

Jerry Pimm watched the Big West Conference tournament final on television 
Sunday afternoon, knowing that his UC Santa Barbara team would make the NCAA 
tournament only if Nevada Las Vegas held off Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
At halftime, Long Beach trailed UNLV by two points and found out it needed to 
win to make the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a grind," Pimm said. "You couldn't make a basket or draw up a special 
play. It was gut-wrenching, sitting there and watching and rooting for UNLV 
hard, knowing that one team was already a No. 1 seed and playing for pride and 
the championship, and the other guy was not going to get to go. That was tough, 
and it was tough on our conference." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara (20-8) lost to Pacific in the conference tournament 
quarterfinals. It plays plays Houston (25-7) Thursday at Knoxville. ROBYN

TV: BIG WEST CONFERENCE SHOULDN'T BEAR BURDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach deserves to be going to the NCAA basketball tournament, 
but isn't. 
</P>
<P>
Who's to blame? 
</P>
<P>
Television might be the biggest culprit. 
</P>
<P>
Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany, chairman of the nine-member NCAA selection 
committee, said on CBS Sunday that a message was being sent to the Big West 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, Delany told the Big West, if you want fairness, then you play your 
conference championship game at an earlier time. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee felt, 'Who should bear the burden?' " Delany said. "Basically, 
we felt the Big West should share the burden if anyone should bear the burden." 
</P>
<P>
ESPN, on the other hand, told the Big West, you want your conference 
championship game televised, you play at 3 p.m. PST. No other time was 
available. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA, meanwhile, has a sweet little deal with CBS to announce the NCAA 
pairings live at 3:30 p.m., a show that Channel 2 was able to carry live. 
</P>
<P>
It was feared that Channel 2, which carried the Pacific 10 tournament final on 
a delayed basis, might have to also delay the pairings show. 
</P>
<P>
But things worked out in Channel 2's favor. 
</P>
<P>
This is a highly rated show, one basketball fans want to see live. 
</P>
<P>
And 3:30 is as late as CBS is willing to schedule the pairings show. It can't 
be at 4 p.m. or later, because 4 p.m. is 7 p.m. in the East. 
</P>
<P>
You don't expect television to preempt prime-time programming in the interest 
of fairness. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA thus was faced with setting the field before knowing how Long Beach 
did against Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA took the easy way out. It simply said, if Long Beach wins, it's in. It 
loses, it's out. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that there are many teams in the tournament less deserving than Long 
Beach, which Saturday night beat New Mexico State, which is seeded sixth in the 
West. It was Long Beach's ninth consecutive victory and 22nd of the season. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say UC Santa Barbara, which beat Long Beach by 15 and 17 points 
during the regular season, doesn't belong in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
CBS commentator Billy Packer, asked if television wasn't to blame in this 
situation, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"You raise a very good point," he said Sunday. "There's no question television 
was a factor. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Delany made a bold statement (when he said the Big West has to bear 
the burden). 
</P>
<P>
"What you could say is, if we announced the pairings at 11 o'clock at night, 
then you wouldn't be faced with this problem." 
</P>
<P>
But the NCAA and CBS see a way to make some money, and Cal State Long Beach 
ends up paying the price.

<P>
Loyola Marymount's first-round NCAA tournament game against New Mexico State at 
8:30 Friday night at Long Beach will be nationally televised by CBS. 
</P>
<P>
The East Coast will get it live at 11:30 p.m., the West Coast delayed at the 
same time. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 2, however, could decide to show it live, and a decision is expected to 
be made today. 
</P>
<P>
Showing the game live would mean preempting a Bugs Bunny special, "Dallas," and 
possibly "Falcon Crest." Or the station might push back "Falcon Crest" from 10 
to around 10:30 p.m., and along with it the 11 o'clock news to 11:30 or so. 
</P>
<P>
The CBS game Thursday night will be Ohio State vs. Providence. Channel 2 will 
show it delayed at 11:30 p.m. LARRY STEWART

RILEY BACKS JOHNSON TO REPEAT AS MVP DESPITE LAKER GUARD'S PESSIMISM

After another dominating performance by his point guard, Laker Coach Pat Riley 
supported Magic Johnson's bid to win the NBA's most valuable player award a 
second consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson already has given his concession speech. 
</P>
<P>
"They aren't going to give it to me," said Johnson after scoring 32 points, 
passing for 14 assists and grabbing eight rebounds Sunday. "They are saying my 
scoring is down from last year, and that's what they look at. I know I should 
be right there (for MVP), but they aren't going to consider me." 
</P>
<P>
The "they" to whom Johnson refers are selected sportswriters who vote on the 
award. 
</P>
<P>
So, who does Johnson believe will win the MVP? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Riley still lobbied for Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to politic for him, but if there's an MVP in this league, if's 
Earvin," Riley said. "He does it every night. He does everything to keep us 
from losing." SAM McMANIS

NFL MEETINGS; 
</P>
<P>
OWNERS TAKE A LOOK AT REVENUE SHARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ORLANDO, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an idea, revenue sharing didn't fly in baseball, but it is alive and well in 
pro basketball. On the first day of their annual convention this week, pro 
football's club owners began looking into it Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
No NFL owner would talk about revenue plans or possibilities for the record. 
But a source said that one option under consideration would bring a 28-club 
sharing of gate receipts and television revenue, with about half going to 
owners and half to players. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, in the NBA's labor contract the money pool includes all receipts 
-- with 53% as the players' share -- and, to prove good faith, the clubs' 
financial books are shown to player representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Most NFL owners vigorously object to opening their books publicly. Thus the 
proposal to solve their labor impasse by using only gate and TV income. The 
reasoning is that these are easy to quantify. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, by far the largest source of NFL income is from tickets sales and TV. 
Those in favor of the idea contend that there would be enough cash in such a 
pool to work out an accommodation with the NFL Players Assn., bringing labor 
peace -- which owners define as their first priority. 
</P>
<P>
The subject came up in recent months in informal discussions among various 
owners, and it reached the convention floor here, a source said, for these 
reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In negotiations with the networks, the NFL has nearly doubled its 
television revenue for each team from $17 million last year to more than $32 
million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Every time the league's television income has risen in recent decades, the 
players have eventually taken most of it. "The players are now getting -- in 
salaries and benefits -- about 63% of our take," George Young, general manager 
of the New York Giants, said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Revenue sharing would mean that, this time, the owners would keep more of 
what they've earned in TV negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It likely would satisfy the players, who proposed it. 
</P>
<P>
The league has been without a collective bargaining agreement since 1987, when 
the players sought a free-agency stipulation that displeased the owners. 
</P>
<P>
Implicit in revenue sharing is some form of free agency, plus a payroll cap 
along with methods for determining many -- if not most -- salaries. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative, some owners are saying, is a salary war with most clubs acting 
independently. They say this would shortly drain away all the fruits of the new 
television agreements. 
</P>
<P>
"Sixteen of the (NFL's) 28 clubs lost money last year," Art Modell, president 
of the Cleveland Browns, said. 
</P>
<P>
That was only three years after the 1987 TV contract seemed the saving of many 
franchises, bringing in a three-year record $1.428 billion -- or $17 million 
per club. 
</P>
<P>
One ironic difference between baseball and football is their approach to 
revenue sharing. In baseball, the owners want it, but the players don't. In 
football, the owners have been against it -- at least until lately -- but the 
players will accept it. 
</P>
<P>
Both sports are without labor contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's owners voted, 28-0, Sunday to ratify Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's 
new network contracts, which will enrich them by $3.64 billion in the next four 
years -- or what they're saying is $32.5 million per club each season. 
</P>
<P>
That's more than twice the $14.4 million that each baseball club is receiving 
annually from its new TV contract. In the NBA contract, television pays each 
team an annual $8.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue said that the average NFL team spent about $35 million on all 
expenses, including player salaries, last year -- meaning that, at the moment, 
television will be paying most of the bills. 
</P>
<P>
"(Pending) salary escalation," Modell said. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also said he has found strong NFL sentiment to permanently cut 
the pre-Super Bowl time period from two weeks to one. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll experiment with it both ways in the next two years," he said. "There 
will be a one-week break ahead of the Super Bowl (in 1991), and two weeks ahead 
of the (Minneapolis Super Bowl) in 1992. We'll see which is the most 
(popular)."

ANNOCONNOR WINS SANTA ANA OVER BROWN BESS, ROYAL TOUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The only thing trainer Rick Mettee knew for sure was that Brown Bess did not 
win. Brown Bess, the 8-year-old mare who was last year's female grass champion, 
was in the middle of Sunday's three-horse photo finish, a Santa Anita thriller 
that also brought Mettee's Annoconnor and Royal Touch to the wire at the same 
time in the $162,000 Santa Ana Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Royal Touch might get there on the inside, I really did," said 
Mettee, who was happy to be wrong when the stewards posted Annoconnor's number. 
The 6-year-old mare, probably running the last race of her career, was in the 
center of the track, so far away from Royal Touch that it was difficult to form 
a perspective from the box seats. The official photo showed that Annoconnor had 
beaten Royal Touch by a head, and Brown Bess, the 13-10 favorite, missed second 
place by a nose. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't have written a script any better than this," Mettee said. 
Annoconnor won her 12th race in 29 starts and earned $94,500, pushing the 
daughter of Nureyev and My Nord over the $1-million mark. Owned by Morton Fink 
and Roy Gottlieb of Chicago, she's scheduled to be flown on April 1 to Kentucky 
to be bred to Mr. Prospector. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Anita runs the Santa Barbara Handicap on March 31. "That race is a 
longshot, especially now that she's gone over the million mark," Mettee said. 
</P>
<P>
Mettee used to be John Gosden's assistant trainer, and he took over the 
handling of Annoconnor full-time last year after Gosden left California for his 
native England. The Santa Ana, run on a cool day before a crowd of 34,752, was 
Mettee's first major victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't be able to replace Annoconnor, but she's turned out to be a big break 
for me," Mettee, 31, said before the race. "She's been awfully versatile, being 
able to win on both the dirt and the grass. She's won going short on the dirt 
and she's won at 1 1/8 miles on the grass. She's won on the lead and coming 
from off of it, and not many horses in California can do that, especially 
fillies and mares." 
</P>
<P>
Ridden by Corey Black, Annoconnor ran 1 1/8 miles on Sunday in 1:47 4/5, more 
than a second off the stakes record, and paid $11 to win as the third choice 
behind Brown Bess and Royal Touch in the seven-horse field. Annoconnor carried 
119 pounds, four less than Brown Bess and two less than Royal Touch. 
</P>
<P>
Brown Bess was beaten by fillies and mares on grass for the first time in eight 
races, dating to September of 1988, but she was still game, running for the 
first time since a record-setting victory in the Yellow Ribbon four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to get a horse on top after that kind of a layoff," trainer Chuck 
Jenda said. "Hopefully she'll improve off this race." 
</P>
<P>
Sherarda led all the way until the quarter pole, when the French filly 
stumbled, forcing Royal Touch and her jockey, Russell Baze, to pause. Brown 
Bess, ridden by Cowboy Jack Kaenel, took over the lead with an eighth of a mile 
to run. 
</P>
<P>
Annoconnor inched ahead in mid-stretch, but Brown Bess stuck her nose back in 
front. All this time, Baze had gotten Royal Touch back in gear and they were 
flying on the rail. 
</P>
<P>
"In my heart, I feel that this is the biggest race I've ever won," Black said. 
"This mare kind of picked me up at a point in my career when things were not 
going so well. Neither of us were well-known when we got together, and she was 
always there to carry me." 
</P>
<P>
Annoconnor was fourth early, and Black took her to the outside to avoid running 
up other horses' heels. 
</P>
<P>
"I was never far off the lead," Black said. "In the last 30 yards, I really got 
into my horse. She wanted it bad." 
</P>
<P>
Black, 21, scored his fifth stakes victory of the meeting, the most he's ever 
had at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have any at all," Baze said. "I had to 
check when the other horse stumbled. What a nice filly this is, to come back 
the way she did." 
</P>
<P>
Fieldy, who was second to Maria Jesse in last year's Santa Ana, finished 
fourth, beaten by about a length after making a late run under Kent Desormeaux. 
</P>
<P>
That was the worst finish of the day for Desormeaux, who had three victories, 
three seconds and one third from eight mounts. The Maryland-based Desormeaux 
rode a record 597 winners last year in winning the Eclipse Award, and since his 
first day at Santa Anita on Feb. 14, he's notched 18 winners. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Thirty Slews, a 3-year-old gelding making his first start, easily won the sixth 
race, running six furlongs in an excellent 1:09 4/5. Thirty Slews, who was 
sired by Slewpy, is trained by Bob Baffert, who started with quarter horses, 
and he's owned by Baffert, Dennis Boer and James Streelman, who raced Zure Hope 
Again, the quarter horse who won the Los Alamitos Derby. "We named him Thirty 
Slews because I paid $30,000 for him (as a yearling) at Keeneland," Baffert 
said. "It was the first time I ever went there, and this was the only horse I 
liked. But it's a good thing they give you credit. They give you 30 days to 
pay. We hadn't started this horse before because he was real big as a 
2-year-old and needed some time." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens finished second to Thirty Slews aboard Homestead, the colt who 
kept him from going to Aqueduct to ride Sunny Blossom in Sunday's Toboggan 
Handicap. Sunny Blossom, under Eddie Maple, won by 5 3/4 lengths, paying $9 and 
beating crack New York sprinters Once Wild and Mr. Nickerson. Sunny Blossom set 
the Santa Anita record for six furlongs with a 1:07 1/5 clocking in the Palos 
Verdes Handicap on Dec. 30. Trainer Eddie Gregson said that the 5-year-old 
gelding would be brought back to California. 
</P>
<P>
Silver Ending, who'll be favored Sunday in the San Felipe Handicap at Santa 
Anita, might skip the Sanita Derby on April 7. Trainer Ron McAnally is 
concerned about the way the Santa Anita track has been favoring front-runners 
and is considering the Jim Beam at Turfway Park on March 31. . . . Jockey David 
Flores has been handed a five-day suspension by the stewards, starting 
Thursday, after a horse he rode, Ying n' Yang, caused interference in 
Saturday's fifth race.

Roy Tarpley, Dallas Maverick forward, was fined $250 after missing the team's 9 
a.m. flight to Houston Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Tarpley said his home in North Dallas suffered a power outage early Saturday, 
causing his alarm clock to stop. 
</P>
<P>
If Tarpley misses another team flight, practice or game before Saturday, he 
would be in violation of the league's anti-drug guidelines set for two-time 
offenders and would have to undergo a drug test.

Union Bank Wins $5-Million Court Award: Accounting firm Arthur Young &amp; Co. 
(now known as Ernst &amp; Young) was ordered Thursday to pay $5 million to 
Union Bank of San Francisco for negligence in preparing financial statements on 
a Los Angeles company. An Orange County Superior Court jury in Santa Ana found 
the financial statements for Small World Greetings were inadequate and faulted 
the bank for sloppy lending practices. (Filed May 17, 1988; Case No. X557156)

When he heard the news, Walter Smith, a 40-year-old, second-generation logger, 
stood with environmentalists and union leaders on the county courthouse steps 
to attack the major source of his livelihood, Louisiana-Pacific Corp. 
</P>
<P>
This "latest assault is the most painful," he said, "since it comes from the 
very people who should be most concerned for our welfare: our employers. The 
workers I've talked to feel betrayed." 
</P>
<P>
The "assault" is Louisiana-Pacific's plan to build a new mill at the port of El 
Sauzal, near Ensenada, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana-Pacific, the world's largest producer of redwood lumber, has managed 
to bring a new level of bitterness to the ongoing arguments about Mendocino 
County's dwindling forests. Now even some traditional timber industry 
supporters, who had long cited the threat of lost employment when 
environmentalists called for slower cutting and more preservation, have become 
exasperated over the company's Mexico plant, with its potential to create 1,000 
jobs across the border. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Eddie, chairman of the Mendocino County Board of Supervisors, says a 
budding effort by some local lumbermen to modify the industry for long-term 
survival on the North Coast has been overshadowed by Louisiana-Pacific's move. 
"It's all blown up," he sighs. 
</P>
<P>
"They're ruining it," choes Raymond Flynn, president of Windsor Mill, a much 
smaller company and sometime competitor of Louisiana-Pacific. "Instead of 
saying, 'Let's solve the problems. . . . Let's put the investment in our own 
country,' they've taken the short-term outlook . . . for short-term profits." 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Louisiana-Pacific blames much of the furor on misinformation and 
a parochial view of sweeping changes coming to the forest-products industry. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman Shepard Tucker dismisses as "ludicrous," for example, 
legislation proposed by state Assemblyman Byron Sher, chairman of the Assembly 
Natural Resources Committee, that would ban the export of whole logs from 
California. 
</P>
<P>
In the larger picture, says Tucker, "we're making a transition from an 
old-growth to young-growth forest and also in the type of product (marketed)." 
</P>
<P>
As happened generations ago in southern U.S. forests, the California timber 
industry is changing in part to accommodate smaller new-growth trees as 
old-growth trees have been cut. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't cut a 2-by-12 (board) out of a tree that is only 8 inches in 
diameter," says Charles Jourdain, vice president of technical services for the 
California Redwood Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Timber companies have lately developed alternative wood structures to meet 
builders' needs, and Jourdain and other industry observers consider 
Louisiana-Pacific to be at the forefront of these "engineered wood products." 
</P>
<P>
The products come from low-value wood material -- smaller trees, tree species 
that have heretofore been considered non-commercial, shavings, chips, flakes, 
wafers or particles -- which are bonded with adhesive under high pressure. They 
can be formed into panels similar to plywood, made into wooden beams or even 
formed to resemble such dimensional lumber as the common 2-by-4. 
</P>
<P>
The processes involved, however, are often labor-intensive, which critics cite 
as a big spur to forest-products manufacturers to open operations in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana-Pacific's new mill will operate as a maquiladora, a manufacturing 
plant exempted by the United States and Mexico from import-export duties and 
designed for both countries to take advantage of low Mexican labor rates. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker insists that Louisiana-Pacific is merely expanding, not moving its 
operations south. The company plans to first open a drying and final planing 
facility in Mexico to finish rough redwood, primarily for the Southern 
California market. Currently, Tucker says, these rough planks are sold to other 
firms for processing. Louisiana-Pacific wants to add the value of further 
processing as one response to industry changes. And the less humid Mexican 
climate will allow drying in open air instead of in energy-consuming kilns. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana-Pacific also sees an advantage in moving its lumber south by barge. 
It now depends on trains that Tucker says can be unpredictable in winter. 
</P>
<P>
(Such concerns were a surprise to the railroads. "I'm not aware of any major 
rail difficulties that have been conveyed by (Louisiana-Pacific) in connection 
with service either provided by Eureka Southern or Southern Pacific," says Tom 
Brueckheimer, assistant vice president, lumber products, for Southern Pacific 
railroad.) 
</P>
<P>
If this first $12-million investment in Mexico is successful, a $100-million 
project is likely. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana-Pacific expects the first plant to create 60 new jobs, the larger 
complex, if approved by its board, will mean 1,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Typical wages in the California mills run $12 to $13 an hour. For similar work 
in El Sauzal, where the minimum wage is 79 cents an hour, wages might run $1.10 
to $1.50 an hour, according to Kristin A. White, a Chula Vista attorney who 
represents owners of maquiladora plants. 
</P>
<P>
"Louisiana-Pacific's plan is a way to make money at the expense of the American 
worker," complains Mendocino Supervisor Norman de Vall. "With an 11% 
unemployment rate in the county, they have the audacity to put this stuff on a 
barge and take it to Mexico. They have said that the only reason they're going 
to Mexico is to air-dry their material faster. I contend that it will air-dry 
at San Diego at virtually the same rate." 
</P>
<P>
De Vall has asked Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) to 
look into a ban on re-importing California redwood, to prevent 
Louisiana-Pacific from bringing its finished product back into Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs aren't the only issue. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker argues that Louisiana-Pacific has no choice but to operate in a 
worldwide economy and points to the more than 2,000 other maquiladora 
operations in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
But Flynn, of Windsor Mill, which for most of its 17 years of operation has 
shown a steady 20% annual increase in sales, believes that U.S. companies fail 
to encourage employee productivity. Louisiana-Pacific is taking the easy route 
to competitiveness by opting for low wages rather than training its American 
workers to work more efficiently, he contends. 
</P>
<P>
He also worries that this short-term advantage can bring long-term damage to 
America's forests. Any company competing with Louisiana-Pacific, he says, will 
have to follow them to Mexico or cut expenses somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
And like many in Mendocino County, he blames financiers. 
</P>
<P>
"Wall Street likes the way Louisiana-Pacific runs their business," says Flynn. 
"Yet you get a company like Weyerhaeuser; Wall Street doesn't like the way they 
run their business. Yet they're doing the right job. They grow a lot of trees. 
They make the thing work. They treat their employees right." 
</P>
<P>
Corporations in general are not well regarded among some in Mendocino County 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
"The more your personal destiny is tied up directly with the land, the better 
off that land is," says Linda Hager Bailey, the county government 
representative on the Mendocino County Forest Advisory Committee, which this 
summer will deliver its plan to stabilize and eventually increase the county's 
timber resources. 
</P>
<P>
"But the whole corporate structure is a distancing of that," Bailey says. "The 
stockholders of Louisiana-Pacific, I assure you, have no idea that the lands of 
Mendocino County have any relationship to the profits that they realize." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, politicians, environmentalists and labor leaders predict that 
Louisiana-Pacific's new plant is just the beginning of a larger move. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Richard N. Sinkin, managing director of InterAmerican Holdings Co., the 
San Diego-based maquiladora management company on contract to 
Louisiana-Pacific, describes an ambitious five-year plan, depending on "how 
well we do in these early stages." 
</P>
<P>
First comes the drying and planing operation, says Sinkin. Then would logically 
come plants for making pallets, fences, defect-free and finger-joined wood for 
molding, a particle-board plant, a veneer-slicing plant, a wooden I-beam plant 
and, finally, a door and window factory. 
</P>
<P>
At least one other big redwood lumber company has set up its own project in 
Mexico. Georgia-Pacific last month bought the maquiladora plant of one of its 
customers, across the border from El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana-Pacific barged its first load of rough lumber, some 2 million board 
feet, to Mexico last month. In four to five months, Tucker says, the planing 
operation will begin. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the de facto alliance of environmentalists, workers and some 
wood-products manufacturers could be fragile at best. 
</P>
<P>
"Workers and environmentalists are natural allies," maintains Betty Ball, 
coordinator of the Mendocino Environmental Center and vice chairwoman of the 
Redwood Chapter of the Sierra Club. Demonstrations are planned. But they are 
unlikely to include manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Although Flynn of Windsor Mill may be angry with Louisiana-Pacific, he hasn't 
completely buried the hatchet with his new allies. 
</P>
<P>
"You can overlook some of the things you don't like about your own industry," 
Flynn said, "because the environmentalists are so wrong. . . . I don't know how 
I would (manage the timber business), but they're just so wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Smith, who denounced Louisiana-Pacific from the courthouse steps, 
has resigned from the small timber-cutting outfit that he co-founded, concerned 
that it could suffer for his stand. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea what I'll do next," says Smith. "All the companies care about 
is the bottom line, not good logging."

Three California metropolitan areas -- Riverside-San Bernardino, Los 
Angeles-Long Beach and Sacramento -- were among the top five in the nation in 
single-family home building activity in 1989, the National Assn. of Home 
Builders reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Riverside-San Bernardino area, with 38,200 building permits, topped the 
list for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
It was followed by the Los Angeles-Long Beach area, with 23,640 permits; 
Washington, with 22,360; Atlanta, with 21,750, and Sacramento, with 16.540. 
</P>
<P>
The Home Builders said 938,000 single-family building permits were issued 
nationally last year, down from 1 million in 1988. Multifamily permits dropped 
to 403,000 in 1989 from 458,000 in 1988 
</P>
<P>
"High interest rates at different times during the year coupled with a sluggish 
economy, affordability problems and consumer hesitance caused total permits for 
single-family and multifamily housing to drop from 1.43 million in 1988 to 1.34 
million last year," said association president Martin Perlman. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the lowest number of permits issued since 1982, during the most recent 
recession, when 1 million units were authorized," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite heading the single-family list, the number of permits issued in the 
Riverside-San Bernardino area was 11.2% below that of 1988, the Home Builders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Permits were up 34.2% in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area and down 23.6% in the 
national capital area and 23.7% in Atlanta. Sacramento posted a 16.8% increase. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-Long Beach area recorded the most multifamily permits, 24,590. 
That was down 23.6% from 1988.

PROFOUND TECHNICAL PROBLEMS FACE X-30; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: BECAUSE IT IS BEING DESIGNED TO GO 17,000 M.P.H., IT WILL NEED NEW 
MATERIALS, A NEW ENGINE AND NEW COMPUTERIZED CONTROLS.

<P>
The aeronautics industry has not produced an aircraft capable of setting speed 
records since the early 1960s, but that is expected to change by the end of 
this decade. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aero-Space Plane, under development by Rockwell International and 
a team of three other firms, is being designed to fly at least 24 times the 
speed of sound or about 17,000 miles per hour, fast enough to soar into Earth 
orbit. 
</P>
<P>
The success of the $5-billion project depends on technology breakthroughs in at 
least three major areas: materials that can survive high temperatures, a new 
type of jet engine and computerized controls to operate the craft. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, also known as the X-30, would use a supersonic combustion ramjet 
engine or "scramjet." The scramjet is sometimes called a "flying stovepipe" 
because it consists simply of an inlet, a fuel combustion chamber and an 
exhaust nozzle. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike a conventional turbojet engine, which uses a mechanical compressor to 
feed high-pressure air to the engine, ramjets and scramjets rely on the force 
of air rushing into the inlet to compress and provide oxygen to the engine. 
</P>
<P>
A scramjet is similar to a ramjet, but with the important exception that the 
air flow into a ramjet slows to subsonic speeds before it is burned. In a 
scramjet, the air must be burned while moving at supersonic speeds. 
</P>
<P>
It may sound simple in concept, but burning liquid hydrogen fuel with oxygen 
moving at supersonic speeds is a daunting task. The air must mix with the 
liquid hydrogen, and the chemical reaction of burning must take place with 
precise timing. 
</P>
<P>
"In a scramjet, the mixing, transition and reaction (all occur at the same) 
time . . ., so everything is always dynamic," said Barry J. Waldman, the 
program's national director. 
</P>
<P>
An Air Force official in the Pentagon said serious questions remain as to 
whether engine combustion in the X-30 can be controlled adequately to prevent 
shock waves from interrupting the burning. 
</P>
<P>
A National Research Council report last year warned, "Flow instability poses 
the possibility of developing strong shock waves and catastrophic loss of the 
engine." 
</P>
<P>
Astronaut Joe Engle, who is consulting for Rockwell on the X-30 design, said 
the craft would have to be carefully flown, since abrupt maneuvers would affect 
the flow of air into the engine. 
</P>
<P>
Since such an engine can operate only during high-speed flight with onrushing 
air, the craft may have to carry two other types of engine: a standard turbojet 
to get it up to ramjet speed and a rocket for maneuvering in airless space. 
</P>
<P>
The scramjet cannot even be tested on the ground, so it will involve new risk. 
All previous manned spacecraft have had rocket engines that were tested 
repeatedly before their first flights. 
</P>
<P>
A partial test of certain X-30 components will be possible in a new wind tunnel 
-- or "shock tunnel" -- that Rockwell's Rocketdyne unit is building in Ventura 
County. It will create a Mach 25 air shock for a thousandth of a second over an 
area of a few square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel, called the Rocketdyne Hypersonic Flow Laboratory and costing about 
$18 million, is just one example of the profound technical problems involved in 
developing the X-30. The fluid dynamics of designing a craft to fly with 
lifting wings at very high Mach numbers is requiring the employment of several 
supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
The inlets and exhaust nozzle of the scramjet, for example, include the 
underbody of virtually the entire aircraft. It is the first time that the 
propulsion system and airframe of an aircraft are so totally interdependent. At 
Mach 25 the aircraft would travel at nearly five miles per second and 
undergoing tremendous heating from the friction of air against its surface. The 
underside of the aircraft would heat up to 2,300 degrees Fahrenheit and the 
nose to 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
The skin of the X-30 will likely be made of a new material, known as titanium 
aluminide, according to Rockwell Vice President Robert H. Gulcher. 
</P>
<P>
If funding continues uninterruptedly, test flights would begin in 1996 and a 
flight into Earth orbit attempted in 1998.

NEW COMPETITION MAKES IT HARDER TO FIND THE BEST BROKER; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTING: EXTRA DILIGENCE IS NEEDED TO FIND AN ADVISER WHO IS MORE INTERESTED 
IN FINE-TUNING YOUR PORTFOLIO THAN MAKING A SALE.

<P>
The big risk in looking for a broker in today's lean, mean financial markets is 
not in signing on with a brokerage that goes broke but picking one that's a 
little too lean and a little too mean. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers are fighting harder for clients now than at any time in the past seven 
years, and that's a development that can be good or bad for potential clients. 
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, there's more tailoring of portfolios to the individual 
needs of investors and more service by brokers looking to please clients. On 
the negative side, there is more cold calling, more pushing of unsuitable 
products and more pressure on individual investors by brokers who might be 
getting a little desperate under the threat of a potential layoff. 
</P>
<P>
It could be said that the good are getting better and the bad are just getting 
worse. Despite highly publicized prosecutions of insider trading, the more 
down-to-earth forms of bad brokering continue, and their resolutions rarely get 
headlines. 
</P>
<P>
James Cloonan, president of the American Assn. of Individual Investors, is 
pushing for brokers to start recording all of their conversations with clients, 
but in the meantime he strongly advises investors to keep journals of their 
dealings with their brokers. 
</P>
<P>
That's fine for building a case of fraud, but the best thing for investors to 
do is select their brokers carefully in the first place. Would-be investors who 
are looking for their first broker or unhappy investors who want to switch 
should consider the following: 
</P>
<P>
* Referrals matter most. A broker recommended by a trusted friend or 
successfully invested relative is the best place to start, but that's not 
necessarily the end of it. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Meakem, senior vice president of Legg Mason in Bethesda, Md., notes 
that if the friend or relative has a vastly different portfolio and investment 
style, the same broker may not work for both of you. Schedule a face-to-face 
meeting with the broker and see if your styles are compatible. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask lots of questions. Find out how long the broker has been a broker. It 
should be at least five years, says Jean Kahl, a broker with Ferris Baker Watts 
of Washington. "Find someone who has seen a bull market and a bear market," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Find out about a broker's style. How often will he or she call you? What is the 
broker's typical client, in terms of age, income, portfolio size and type of 
investments? Does the broker specialize in certain financial areas? What is the 
fee structure? 
</P>
<P>
* Find a broker who will ask you lots of questions. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to find out what your goals are, what you want to accomplish, how 
active you want to be, what you are allergic to," Kahl said. "If a broker isn't 
interested in finding out about you, you can guarantee the investments he 
recommends are not going to be in your best interest." 
</P>
<P>
* Define terms. It's not enough to say you are cautious or committed to the 
long term. Make sure that you and the broker both mean the same things when you 
say those words. 
</P>
<P>
* Look for memberships. There's no one membership that guarantees a good 
broker, nor does the absence of any of these citations mean the broker is 
necessarily bad. 
</P>
<P>
But for added protection it doesn't hurt to make sure the brokerage is a member 
of the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, the industry's self-regulatory 
organization (almost all reputable brokerages are) and registered with the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Many brokerages are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If 
so, check with the agency to see whether it has taken disciplinary action 
against the firm you're considering. 
</P>
<P>
* Consider large and small brokerages. The bigger firms might have nationwide 
networks, speedier computer programs and more glossy literature. But a smaller, 
regional brokerage can know more about the stocks of local companies and the 
bonds of local municipalities.

BEARS, BULLS DUKE IT OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wall Street's bears keep looking for more reasons stocks should go lower. The 
bulls, meanwhile, look at those reasons and find ways to discredit them all. 
During the past few weeks, the bulls have been winning the battle. 
</P>
<P>
The latest bear concern: A jump in short-term interest rates. Earlier this 
year, while long-term rates soared here and abroad, short-term rates were 
stable. Now, they, too, are rising -- partly a result of attempts by world 
central banks to stop the dollar's rise, said Edward Yardeni, economist at 
Prudential-Bache Securities. 
</P>
<P>
The banks are selling Treasury bills to raise dollars, so they can dump the 
currency and depress its value. As more T-bills are sold, it becomes a buyer's 
market, and yields rise. 
</P>
<P>
Short rates also are rising because of continued pressure on foreign rates and 
because of concerns that the U.S. economy is strengthening, Yardeni said. Those 
concerns were heightened by Friday's healthy February employment report, which 
sent long rates up anew. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even after Friday's jump in rates, the Dow Jones industrials lost just 
12.84 to 2,683.33, for a net gain of 22.97 for the week. The Dow is up 119, or 
4.6%, since Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Are the bulls just kidding themselves? Richard Russell, editor of La 
Jolla-based Dow Theory Letter, insists that the latest rally "is just relieving 
an oversold condition. It has nothing to do with the fundamentals." Like it or 
not, we're in a bear market, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many bears say that disastrous first-quarter profit reports will be the 
catalyst for another big drop in stocks. But Madhav Dhar, stock strategist at 
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., said that while profits may disappoint, interest 
rates should be headed lower by April. The net result, he said, is that 
investors will be confident enough about economic growth to keep pushing cash 
into stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings up another perennial bull argument: Where else is money supposed 
to go? "The sidelines are crowded with sold-out bears," argues Gene Seagle, 
technical market analyst for Gruntal &amp; Co. in Stamford, Conn. Seagle, a 
40-year market veteran, looks at Eastern Europe's revolution and asks, "How do 
you get a down market in the face of a restimulation of the world economy?' 
</P>
<P>
While bulls and bears fight it out, the best strategy may be this: If you're 
buying stocks, just be sure you'd be comfortable holding them for two years 
minimum. The payoff may take that long. 
</P>
<P>
Being Paid To Wait: You can earn a 7.6% annualized yield from the average money 
fund nowadays. Or you can earn an 8.4% yield from Chase Manhattan stock -- just 
from the dividends. Assuming that the stock eventually goes up, you'll get a 
capital gain as well. In the meantime, you're paid a good return to wait. 
</P>
<P>
While investors have been pouring money into selected stocks lately, some 
issues remain unloved. And some of those stocks sport dividend yields that seem 
outrageously high. The reason for the high yields is simple math: While the 
stocks have been dumped, the companies have maintained or increased their 
dividends. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Wall Street hasn't battered these stocks for nothing. Wherever you 
see an alluring yield on a non-utility stock, big investors are assuming 
there's a strong chance that the dividend could be cut. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of major banks such as Chase or Chemical Banking, the assumption is 
that larger loan losses are ahead. In the case of savings and loans such as 
Glenfed Inc. or CalFed Inc., the assumption is that the government may 
ultimately force the S&amp;Ls to cut their dividends to boost capital. In the 
case of auto makers, investors fear that auto sales will slump to a point where 
company losses will lead to slashed dividends. 
</P>
<P>
Given those concerns, all high-dividend stocks are by definition high risk. But 
Wall Street has been skittish about big bank stocks for years, yet most have 
survived loan problems, maintained their dividends and rallied periodically. 
Meanwhile, analyst Ronald Glantz at Dean Witter Reynolds rates Ford and GM 
dividends "98% safe" through 1991. Unlike in the early-'80s slump, Ford and GM 
are in far better financial shape to weather a downturn. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;Ls may be a tougher call. Glenfed and CalFed both meet U.S. capital 
rules. But they also must meet rising capital standards over time, and the 
market clearly is worried on that count. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if these dividends are maintained, investors who buy the stocks don't 
have to see much capital appreciation to earn a substantial total return. If 
you earn 8% from the dividend, and the stock goes up only 7% a year, you've 
earned 15%. Just remember: These aren't bets for your grocery money. 
</P>
<P>
SHORT RATES SURGE 
</P>
<P>
Short-term interest rates, flat for much of this year, have jumped during the 
past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
HIGH DIVIDEND YIELDS 
</P>
<P>
Dividend yields on some non-utility stocks approach or exceed the 7.6% average 
yield of money market funds.

FRENCH GAME PLAN TO GET FARMERS BOGGLES THE MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN SLOAN, ALLAN SLOAN is a financial columnist for Newsday in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the surface, the question of whether regulators in California and eight 
other states should let something called Faraxa Corp. take over Farmers Group's 
insurance operations is about as exciting as watching paint dry. Just the 
application that Faraxa submitted to the Illinois Insurance Department to take 
over Farmers' subsidiary there weighs 15 pounds, according to my bathroom 
scale. The arguments in California's hearings between Faraxa and Farmers 
lawyers are so nit-picky that they sound like doctrinal disputes between 
members of a religious cult. 
</P>
<P>
Why should you care about any of this? Because there is actually something 
interesting going on here. It may even be important. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of Faraxa's bid for Farmers will probably determine whether Sir James 
Goldsmith, the Anglo-French takeover artist, ever gets to make his $21-billion 
hostile bid for BAT Industries, Britain's biggest conglomerate. That would be 
the world's second-largest takeover, after RJR Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
BAT, which bought Farmers last year, is trying desperately to keep Goldsmith at 
bay, not least because his plans call for selling most of the company and 
firing most of its managers. 
</P>
<P>
If Farmers manages to foil Faraxa, Goldsmith's raid on BAT is probably 
finished. If Faraxa wins, the fun begins. 
</P>
<P>
Faraxa, the would-be buyer of Farmers, is one of about 6 zillion subsidiaries 
of Axa-Midi Assurances, a French insurance company that also has industrial and 
real estate holdings. Axa-Midi has made a deal to buy Farmers from Goldsmith if 
Goldsmith takes over BAT. 
</P>
<P>
What Axa-Midi is trying to pull off is breathtaking. The company wants to use 
$4.5 billion, all of it borrowed money, to buy Farmers. In one stroke, 
Axa-Midi, which doubled its size in 1988 when Axa took over Midi, would 
redouble in size and transform itself from a European company to a worldwide 
giant. 
</P>
<P>
"I can no longer just be a poor little Froggie with my beret on my head," 
Claude Bebear (pronounced BAY-BAY-r), Axa-Midi's chairman, says with a Gallic 
shrug. Given that Europe is turning into a single market, "if we remain only a 
small French insurance company, we will have to fight to survive," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The $4.5 billion for Farmers, plus another $1 billion that Axa-Midi plans to 
use to buy into Hoylake Investments, the company that Goldsmith is using to 
raid BAT, is a good part of the cash portion of Goldsmith's proposed offer. 
Goldsmith can't make the offer, under British rules, until and unless Axa-Midi 
gets regulators' permission to take over Farmers. 
</P>
<P>
If Axa-Midi were an American company, its request to buy Farmers would be 
laughed out of the place. Why? Because its corporate structure is 
incomprehensible to mortal man. And because you can't get away with borrowing 
100% of the purchase price for a takeover in these post-junk, post-Drexel 
Burnham Lambert days, when debt is declasse. 
</P>
<P>
Bebear's plan, which sounds almost reasonable when he explains it, goes like 
this: 
</P>
<P>
The $1 billion to buy into Hoylake comes from cash on hand, or relatively minor 
borrowings by various Axa-Midi companies. To raise the $4.5 billion to buy 
Farmers, Axa-Midi will borrow $2.25 billion from banks and the other $2.25 
billion from Goldsmith by giving him promissory notes rather than cash. 
(Goldsmith will turn the notes into cash to help pay for his BAT offer by 
selling the notes or borrowing against them.) 
</P>
<P>
Axa-Midi will repay the bank loans, plus interest, with dividends from Farmers. 
It will repay the $2.25 billion of notes to Goldsmith, which have relatively 
short maturities, from profits, from selling shares in group companies to 
investors or by disposing of non-insurance assets, such as an African beer 
company that it just unloaded for several hundred million dollars, or by 
selling some of its enormously valuable landholdings in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"We can easily raise this money," Bebear says. "The $2.25 billion of notes 
isn't really debt. It's deferred equity." 
</P>
<P>
"He can call it deferred equity or whatever he wants, but it's still short-term 
debt," says Charles Schultz, Farmers' senior vice president for finance. 
Schultz, who has been sparring with Bebear for months, seems to have come to 
like the man. "With his charm and our facts, it would be a slam-dunk," Schultz 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Does Bebear's plan make sense? Can he really raise the money he says he can? 
Can Farmers pay Axa-Midi enough dividends to repay the bank debt without 
putting its policyholders at risk? 
</P>
<P>
Beats me. It's hard enough to analyze a U.S. insurance company because 
insurance is complicated to begin with and firms keep entirely different sets 
of books for stockholders and for insurance regulators. A French insurance 
company, especially this one, is a mind-blower. 
</P>
<P>
Axa-Midi has so many twists and turns that its structure looks like someone's 
small intestine, not a corporation. 
</P>
<P>
I'll spare you most of the details. All you have to know is that the company 
ultimately is based on three large mutual insurance companies, which are owned 
by their policyholders. Piled atop them is a group of controlled, partly owned 
subsidiaries that own pieces of each other. The piece de resistance is 
Compagnie du Midi, acquired in 1988 when its managers ran to Bebear asking for 
protection against a raid by an Italian company, Generali-Assicurazioni 
Generali. Axa now controls Midi by owning 60% of an Axa-Generali holding 
company that owns a majority of Midi's stock. 
</P>
<P>
See? Isn't that clear? And that's the simple version. 
</P>
<P>
The point of all this is to introduce Axa-Midi and Claude Bebear, who are 
clearly going to be heard from again. And to give you an idea of how the world 
has changed to the point where European companies we never heard of can make 
10-digit takeover bids for American firms. It's a sobering thought.

MOST LIBRARIES IN ORANGE COUNTY ARE 'HAVES' IN A SEA OF 'HAVE-NOTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILES CORWIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Orange County, the Fountain Valley Public Library is so flush with funding 
that its new branch, now under construction, will feature reading lounges with 
fireplaces, original artwork, sculptures in the patios and a 30-foot dragon in 
the children's wing. 
</P>
<P>
The designer library, with its striking fan-shaped building, black-and-white 
tile floors and color scheme of turquoise, pink and sea green, will have the 
architectural elan of a modern art museum. 
</P>
<P>
But while the Orange County Public Library system is thriving, Shasta County's 
libraries are struggling for survival. The funding shortage afflicting the 
Northern California county is so critical that all 10 libraries closed in 1988 
for seven months. Only the main facility and two branches have since reopened, 
but with reduced hours. 
</P>
<P>
California's libraries are increasingly being divided "between the haves and 
the have-nots," said California State Librarian Gary E. Strong. 
</P>
<P>
The surge in real estate values and explosive growth during much of the 1980s 
has increased property-tax revenues and created more funding for libraries in 
fast-growing counties such as Orange County and Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
But in California's poorer communities or counties where there has been little 
growth, libraries never have recovered from the effects of Proposition 13, the 
1978 tax-cutting initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not much middle ground anymore . . . there's this disparity, and it's 
only going to become more pronounced," Strong said. "Those affluent communities 
with a lot of growth and the commitment to libraries are doing well. But those 
other areas are going to barely be able to keep their libraries open." 
</P>
<P>
The late 1970s were the dark days for Southern California libraries, which 
faced a struggle for survival after the passage of Proposition 13. Branches 
were closed. Hours were cut. Librarians were fired. Budgets were slashed. 
</P>
<P>
Today, many Southern California libraries still are struggling. But there are 
signs of resurgence, and some communities are in better shape now than at any 
time since Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Public Library represents a shining exception to the dreary 
future faced by many other library systems across the country. The 27-branch 
library system is brimming with tax money. 
</P>
<P>
The library recovered from initial cutbacks caused by Proposition 13 because 
the measure had less of an impact on the taxes for new home purchases, which 
soared during the 1980s in Orange County. A full 75% of the system's current 
$23-million budget for 1989-90 comes from the county's tax base, swollen from 
rising land and housing prices. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the county requires community developers to pay a portion of new 
library costs. 
</P>
<P>
The surge in funding has even enabled Orange County to provide some of the best 
library service in the state. And more affluent communities such as Fountain 
Valley can add city funds to their county funding and create impressive branch 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County also has experienced a great deal of growth and rising 
property values and, as a result, the library system has made a strong recovery 
from the tax cuts of the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we fortunately are in good shape," said County Librarian Sandra 
Reuben. "There's been a natural increase in funding because of the health of 
the real estate market in Los Angeles. This is where we differ from other parts 
of the state." 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, growth has helped, but libraries "still don't have the 
buying power that they had had prior to 1978," said Dixie Adeniran, the 
director of library services for Ventura County. The most immediate problem in 
Ventura County is lack of space. At the Oxnard Public Library, about 4,000 
unshelved books are piled on the floor in stacks several feet high, and another 
12,000 books are in storage because there simply is no room on the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Because of slow-growth measures in Santa Barbara, the county library system has 
not greatly benefited from property-tax revenues, said Carol Keator, director 
of the Santa Barbara Public Library system. The downtown library, considered 
one of the finest small libraries in the state, receives adequate funding 
because city officials have made a commitment to the facility. But branches 
outside the city receive only limited county funding, which has not kept pace 
with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a significant erosion in the county's libraries," Keator said. 
"We've lost staff positions and service hours. And we've been unable to buy 
many of the books we need, or replace a lot of older materials." 
</P>
<P>
And not even all the libraries in Orange County have thrived. Aside from the 
county system, there are nine library systems that are run by individual cities 
and special districts. A few of these, in the county's less affluent areas, 
have struggled during the past decade. The city of Santa Ana, for example, 
decided to close the McFadden Library, one of its main library's two branches. 
But as a result of public concern that children would be denied access to 
books, money was found in the budget, said Rob Richard, head librarian. The 
library remained open, but with reduced hours. 
</P>
<P>
Those who spoke against closing the library argued that a well-educated and 
literate populace can eventually help reduce crime as much as expanded fire and 
police budgets. 
</P>
<P>
"But it takes a number of years to show up," Richard said. "It's having faith 
that what you're doing now will have a future payoff. Like teaching." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, library officials say their system has suffered from being 
considered a low priority in the local government budget. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Richard Waters, a nationally recognized library consultant, 
described San Diego's run-down central library building as "the worst one in 
the country . . . (among major cities). I would stand before God, flag and 
anyone else and say that if you look at the 10 major cities in the U.S., San 
Diego is physically the worst library in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Today, San Diego City Librarian William Sannwald assessed the state of the 
downtown library and came to the conclusion that only one thing has changed: It 
is now in even worse shape. 
</P>
<P>
"The air conditioning and heating don't work," Sannwald said. "Anytime it rains 
the building leaks. The lighting is terrible. The whole place is falling 
apart." 
</P>
<P>
Plastic sheeting is frequently used to cover book stacks because of leaky 
pipes, according to Sannwald. The library can't add any more computer terminals 
because "added electrical devices . . . even coffee pots, tend to blow fuses," 
he said. And about 40% of the downtown building's books are in storage because 
the library lacks space for public display, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You need elected officials who are strongly committed to libraries -- we've 
never had that in San Diego," Sannwald complained. "We've had a tradition of 
poor funding." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's city library system is funded at a rate of $13 per capita, while 
some city libraries in California spend more than three times that amount. The 
Long Beach City Library spends about $26 per capita; Palm Springs spends $40 
and Berkeley spends about $59 per capita. And San Diego County spends only 
about $9 per capita on its library system, compared to $17 in Orange County and 
about $16 in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with San Diego's embattled library system are banking their hopes for 
improvement on a November bond issue that would raise more than $80 million to 
build a new 375,000-square-foot downtown building and rebuild about 10 aging 
branch libraries. Consultants predict that downtown library usage would jump by 
50% if the new building is erected. But the bond issue must attract a 
two-thirds majority to win. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to San Diego, Los Angeles library officials praise city government 
and local residents for having been extremely supportive as the city library 
system has struggled to recuperate from a crippling series of blows. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the Hollywood branch library was destroyed by fire. Then in 1986, a 
devastating arson blaze struck the city's historic Central Library, the busiest 
public library west of Chicago. A second arson fire hit the same building later 
that year. More than 400,000 books were destroyed, and another 700,000 suffered 
water damage. Many of the remaining books in the 2.3-million-volume collection 
suffered smoke damage. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in 1987, the Whittier earthquake rattled libraries from Hollywood to 
Boyle Heights, causing structural damage to five of the city's branch 
libraries, one of which remains closed today. 
</P>
<P>
The succession of setbacks, particularly the fires, resulted in a massive 
outpouring of public and corporate support, which has set the library system on 
the road to recovery. And last October, the City Council approved a $180- 
million plan to renovate and expand the 63-year-old Central Library. Half of 
the funds are to come from the private developers of the adjacent 73-story 
First Interstate World Center, a skyscraper that won approval under the 
condition that the massive commitment be made to update the public library. 
</P>
<P>
Now due to reopen on April 1, 1993, the Central Library, currently housed in 
temporary quarters, is to more than double in size. 
</P>
<P>
"We're different from other parts of the country because there have been 
opportunities for people to express that they care about their library," said 
city library spokesman Robert G. Reagan. "And when they express themselves in 
large numbers, that's what (politicians) read . . . and then you have clout."

4 KILLED WHEN PLANE CRASHES IN MALIBU FOG; 
</P>
<P>
AVIATION: TWO MEN AND TWO WOMEN WERE RETURNING FROM DINNER IN OXNARD. ALL WERE 
BURNED BEYOND RECOGNITION.

Four people were killed late Saturday when their small plane burst into a ball 
of flames after crashing into a rugged fog-shrouded hilltop overlooking the 
ocean in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The manager of a charter aviation company in Santa Monica said the victims were 
the plane's owner and three friends. He said the party had flown from Santa 
Monica to Oxnard for dinner and were returning when the Piper Cherokee crashed. 
</P>
<P>
Masato Suzuki, manager of Captain U.S.A., said the victims were Kaz Nakamura, a 
Japan Air Lines flight instructor, Nakamura's friend Masatoshi Yokota and his 
wife, Fumiko, and another female passenger he knew only by a nickname. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County coroner's officials said the bodies were burned beyond 
recognition, and no official identification would be made until dental records 
are reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki said Nakamura, who is based in Napa, would fly his personal plane to 
Santa Monica on weekends to train student pilots. Nakamura, he said, was an 
experienced pilot with more than 6,500 hours of flying, but Suzuki said he was 
not sure who was flying the plane when it crashed. 
</P>
<P>
The crash "was a horrendous experience," said Lewis Marvin, 56, who, along with 
his wife and three children, was awakened shortly after 11 p.m. when the plane 
plowed into the hillside less than 70 feet from his house. "I looked out the 
window and I thought that the whole world had blown up." 
</P>
<P>
When the accident occurred, county fire Capt. Michael Johnson said, the fog was 
so thick that fire personnel responding "couldn't even see the hood of the fire 
truck." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the weather and the remoteness of the area, Marvin said, 
firefighters and rescue workers did not arrive at the scene until the flames 
were almost out. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin's residence in the 20000 block of Everding Motorway is the only 
structure within earshot of where the accident occurred, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night's fog, according to a spokesman for WeatherData Inc., which 
supplies weather forecasts for The Times, resulted from a coastal storm that 
dropped as much as half an inch of rain in the area. By Sunday, he said, the 
storm had moved east leaving a prediction of clear and cool skies through the 
early part of the week with temperatures reaching only into the lower 60s.

UCI STUDENT IS KILLED IN CAR ACCIDENT

Chad Zabish, a freshman science major at UC Irvine, told his mother Saturday 
night that he and a friend were going out to a film festival in Costa Mesa and 
would be back about 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old from Cypress never returned. An investigator from the Orange 
County coroner's office awakened Zabish's mother about 2:30 a.m. and told her 
that her only child had been killed in a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
Zabish's childhood friend, David Moore, 19, also a UCI freshman from Cypress, 
suffered a broken jaw and numerous cuts in the 12:47 a.m. Sunday accident at 
the rain-slick intersection of Orangewood and Knott avenues in Cypress, Cypress 
Police Officer Jeff Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore was listed in good condition Sunday at UCI Medical Center in Orange. Wong 
said the accident happened when a Toyota pickup hit broadside a red MG 
convertible being driven by Moore. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-agers in the truck -- a couple returning from a late dinner -- escaped 
serious injury, Wong said. Eighteen-year-old Erica Kortje of Huntington Beach 
told officers that she was driving because her boyfriend, William MacIntosh, 
19, of Stanton, had been drinking. Both were treated and released for minor 
injuries at Humana Hospital in Westminster. Police ask that any witnesses call 
Cypress police at (714) 229-6600. 
</P>
<P>
Zabish's grandmother, Betty Zabish, 64, of Cypress, said her grandson had 
graduated with honors last year from Pacifica High School in Garden Grove, 
where he played on the school's water polo team. A friend of Zabish since first 
grade, Moore graduated at the same time and both enrolled in fall classes at UC 
Irvine, Betty Zabish said. 
</P>
<P>
Chad Zabish had also been working for the past year at the Compact Disc Center 
in Los Alamitos. The store owner, Bob Barrett, said Zabish was a model 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Zabish said he was her only grandson. His father had died at age 25 of 
cancer, and within three years of that his maternal grandparents also died of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Zabish's mother, Candice Stacy, 41, was too distraught to comment Sunday. But 
her husband, Larry Stacy, 41, said the accident was especially tragic because 
the teen-ager had been doing so well in school and at work and looked forward 
to a career as a marine biologist. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wong, Moore and Zabish were returning home on westbound Orangewood 
Avenue at the same time that Kortje and MacIntosh were headed home south on 
Knott Avenue.

Lyle Menendez -- and, possibly, his younger brother, Erik -- will be arraigned 
today in Beverly Hills Municipal Court in the shotgun murders of their parents, 
entertainment executive Jose Menendez and his wife, Kitty. 
</P>
<P>
Erik, 19, gave himself up at Los Angeles International Airport at 1:10 a.m. 
Sunday after arriving on a flight from the East Coast. He had notified police 
of his travel plans and was immediately taken into custody by four detectives, 
Beverly Hills Police Lt. Robert Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief meeting with his lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro, at the Beverly Hills 
police station, the suspect was taken to the downtown Los Angeles County Men's 
Central Jail, where he was booked on suspicion of murder and held without bond. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a voluntary surrender," Shapiro told the Associated Press. "Immediately 
upon being made aware of the allegations against him, he made arrangements. It 
shows tremendous character and strength to immediately face these allegations." 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Lyle, 22, was arrested Thursday as he left the family home on Elm 
Drive. He remains jailed without bond. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner scheduled a news conference for this morning to outline 
the charges against the brothers. The counts were expected to include homicide 
under "special circumstances," which would mean the possibility of the death 
penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Erik, who decided on a professional tennis career after his parents' deaths 
last summer, rather than start his freshman year at UCLA, had been playing in a 
tournament in Israel when he received word that his brother had been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect made clear through relatives that he would voluntarily return and 
give himself up to police. His return to Los Angeles, according to police 
spokesman Curtis, was "relatively circuitous," but he did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
En route to Los Angeles, Erik stopped on the East Coast to confer with family 
members before continuing to Los Angeles in the company of a relative, a family 
source said. Erik's mental state was understood to be good, said the source, 
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"He's confident," the source said, that the police would realize the gravity of 
their mistake and that "he will soon be set free." 
</P>
<P>
The Menendez family has rallied behind the brothers and believes police made a 
mistake in arresting the two. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a very embarrassing situation for the authorities," the 
relative said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Menendez, 45, chief executive of Live Entertainment Inc. of Van Nuys, a 
video and music distributor, and his wife, Kitty, 44, were slain the evening of 
Aug. 20. The couple had been watching television in the first-floor library of 
their Elm Drive home when two gunmen suddenly entered through an unlocked door 
and opened fire with 12-gauge shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
At first, detectives faced a plethora of leads -- including the possibility 
that the couple had been the victims of an organized crime hit. But as their 
investigation progressed, they concentrated on the victims' sons. 
</P>
<P>
After the arrest of Lyle, Beverly Hills Police Chief Marvin D. Iannone told a 
news conference that there could be several motives for the slayings. He noted, 
for example, that the brothers were the sole beneficiaries of their parents' 
$14-million estate in the event the parents died at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
There were no witnesses to the slayings. According to investigative sources, a 
small -- but important -- amount of physical evidence has been obtained by 
police, including a 12-gauge shotgun shell found in one of Lyle's jackets; and 
some shotgun shell wadding found at the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
A large amount of circumstantial evidence is also in police hands, accumulated 
in the course of months of interviews with individuals who knew the brothers. 
</P>
<P>
And just before the arrest of Lyle, detectives were able to seize some tapes 
made by a Beverly Hills psychologist whom the brothers had been seeing. The 
tapes, according to sources, are considered an important part of the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Curtis reiterated the position of his chief and the investigating 
detectives that a compelling murder case had been pieced together against Lyle 
and Erik. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we have a very strong case," the lieutenant said.

DRUG-EXPOSED BABIES BOG SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
CARE: IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF 1989, ORANGE COUNTY IDENTIFIED AN AVERAGE OF 
27 DRUG BABIES A MONTH, UP FROM 16 IN 1987. AUTHORITIES SAY THEY ARE 
OVERLOADING THE EMERGENCY SHELTER SYSTEM. 
</P>

<P>
A near doubling of drug-exposed babies is overloading Orange County's emergency 
shelter system and forcing hospitals to board the infants, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Beside the potential social devastation of drug-damaged children, the dollar 
cost to the taxpayers in 1989 was more than $258,000. The figure is significant 
because for the first time, "we can now put a dollar amount on the problem," 
said Bob Theemling, director of Orangewood Children's Home. "We knew this was a 
social problem. Now we can say, look, this is costing all of us money." 
</P>
<P>
A report released last week by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department 
estimated that it will cost $500,000 a year to provide hospital and foster care 
for 8,974 cocaine-exposed babies reported in eight cities -- Los Angeles, 
Miami, Phoenix, Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Tacoma and Ft. Wayne. The 
report estimated that a total 100,000 cocaine-exposed babies are born each year 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three months of 1989, Orange County identified an average of 27 
drug babies a month, up from 16 in 1987, the first year statistics were 
collected, said Mary Harris, a program analyst with the Orange County Social 
Services Agency. Most tested positive for a combination of drugs -- primarily 
cocaine and others such as methamphetamines. 
</P>
<P>
About 30% of the infants, those with parents in drug treatment programs, were 
sent home. But authorities placed the remainder in protective custody. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the infants went to the county's emergency shelter, Orangewood 
Children's Home. But because of the increase, Orangewood is often full, so 
hospitals are forced to board the children temporarily until shelter or foster 
homes can be found, said Bill Steiner, executive director of the Orangewood 
Children's Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "boarder babies" -- common in drug-plagued cities such as New 
York and Washington -- are a new phenomenon in Orange County, Steiner said. 
"Five years ago we did not have this kind of an issue," he said. "All these are 
drug babies." 
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the number of boarder babies rose from 60 to 78 at 
hospitals in Orange County, according to a survey undertaken last month by the 
Orangewood Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
One infant remained at a hospital in the county 50 days at a cost to county 
taxpayers of $19,431. Last year, the cost of their extended stays rose from 
$161,543 to $258,542. The county picks up the bill because Medi-Cal coverage 
ends when a patient can be released medically. 
</P>
<P>
At Martin Luther Hospital in Anaheim, the total number of days the boarder 
babies stayed increased from 41 days in 1988 to 116 in 1989, creating what 
President George Mack called a major capacity and staffing problem. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the babies occupy beds needed by other newborns, said Vicki 
Lombardi, administrative director of women's and children's services. Packing 
15 into a room meant for 12 also increases the risk of passing infections, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While cocaine babies do not suffer the typical "withdrawal" of heroin babies, 
they are irritable, difficult to feed, have a piercing cry and become 
overstimulated easily, hospital workers said. It may also be hard on nurses who 
must watch the newborns thrash and cry without being able to help them, 
Lombardi said. 
</P>
<P>
"You try to cuddle them, they still scream. You try to feed them, they throw 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Some authorities worry about the psychological damage to children whose first 
home is a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't get the emotional and visual stimulation they should," Lombardi 
said. "Under the constant glare of nursery lights and change of nurses, they 
don't learn day and night cycles or to relate to one person," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Nurses use swings and wagons to carry them around, "but it's not the same," she 
said. "It's tough for those babies' development." 
</P>
<P>
"They should be bonding with families and not be in a hospital setting," 
Steiner said. "But if there are no alternatives, that's what we're up against. 
</P>
<P>
"The phenomenon is causing increasing concern to everyone working with these 
children." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the boarder babies are placed in foster homes, with relatives, or 
at Orangewood or other shelters when there is room available, Theemling said. 
</P>
<P>
But with a dwindling pool of foster homes, ideal placements are difficult for 
nearly all children in custody and even worse for drug babies who need special 
care. 
</P>
<P>
Both the county Social Services Agency and UCI Medical Center offer training 
programs for prospective foster parents and caretakers of drug babies. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, authorities are seeking longer range solutions. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Services Agency and the Health Care Agency are developing an 
outreach program for drug-using pregnant women so that they can obtain 
treatment "without being concerned about legal implications," Harris said. 
"Hopefully, they would avoid the need to have the baby come into custody."

GROUP REACHES OUT TO DISABLED CALLERS

<P>
A nonprofit organization in Anaheim has begun a publicity campaign to make 
handicapped people in Orange County aware of special telephone services that 
may be available to them free. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of good services for disabled people available in the state," 
said Brenda Premo, executive director of the Dayle McIntosh Center for the 
Disabled. "Unfortunately, the people who design these services don't think 
about the importance of marketing these services to the people who need them 
the most." 
</P>
<P>
Premo said Pacific Bell, General Telephone and other companies in the state are 
legally required to offer telephone services to the handicapped but that 
efforts to publicize the services have been poor. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of a $45,000 grant, the Dayle McIntosh Center has taken the 
matter into its own hands by starting a publicity campaign called "Dialog," 
which sends telephone company representatives to the community to give 
presentations on equipment and services. The center has also designed 
information posters for speech and hearing centers and rehabilitation hospitals 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Our grant money is helping us to reach out to people with disabilities, their 
families and the people they work with to let them know the kinds of services 
that are available to them," Premo said. 
</P>
<P>
Such services include a speaker phone, which allows a caller to talk into a 
microphone and hear the person on the other end without having to hold a 
receiver. For the visually impaired, large number overlays can be installed. 
Amplifiers are available for the hearing impaired, and for those who are deaf, 
a typewriter device connected to the telephone allows callers to type their 
messages to an operator, who relays it and types back a reply. Those who are 
both deaf and blind may be able to receive a Braille version of this device. 
</P>
<P>
"We have everything from an amplifier for Grandma to a special telephone that a 
person with only head movement can activate by puffing on a switch," said Joy 
Tyo, manager of disabled services at Pacific Bell. "I think this is an exciting 
time. Equipment is now very small and compact because of rapid advances in 
computer technology. I think it's only going to get easier and easier for the 
disabled population to use the telephone and experience that independence that 
we all depend on." 
</P>
<P>
To apply for disabled telephone services, call Pacific Bell, Deaf and Disabled 
Services, 1-800-772-3140 or the General Telephone Special Needs Center, 
1-800-821-2585. 
</P>
<P>
The next Dialog presentation is scheduled for 12:15 p.m. Tuesday at the Anaheim 
Convention Center. Call (714) 772-8285 for details. GREG HERNANDEZ

COUNCIL TO VOTE ON $100 PAY INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will vote this month on a proposal to increase council 
members' salaries from $300 to $400 per month. 
</P>
<P>
Council members James Flora, Douglas Bystry and William D. Mahoney argued that 
out-of-pocket expenses related to service as council members exceeded the 
current $300 pay. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman John C. Holmberg challenged his colleagues to produce evidence 
of those expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Holmberg urged the council to postpone consideration of the increase until the 
1990-91 budget is drafted. When his suggestion received no support, Holmberg 
said: "I think it's arrogant for the council to say, 'We're going to put this 
pay increase ahead of everything else in the budget.' As a taxpayer, it really 
irritates me." 
</P>
<P>
The council voted to decide the issue on March 20. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Beth Graham, arguing for the raise, said, "No one should be precluded 
from service on the council because of financial status." Graham said she has 
been fortunate that her employer allows her to be absent from work on city 
business without a loss in pay. 
</P>
<P>
The council's salaries have not changed since 1982, City Manager Lee Risner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Council salaries in Orange County's 29 cities range from nothing, in Seal Beach 
and Villa Park, to $690 monthly in Costa Mesa and Orange, Risner said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members also receive a stipend of $30 for each meeting of the La Habra 
Redevelopment Agency, on which they all serve as directors. These meetings are 
customarily held at the end of City Council meetings and average about one each 
month, Risner said. 
</P>
<P>
State law limits the pay increase to no more than $120, or 5% per year since 
the last raise in 1982, he said. DAVID F. BURKE

MAN CRITICALLY HURT IN SHOOTING AT LOT

<P>
A man was shot and seriously wounded Sunday in a crowded Target store parking 
lot where he was involved in a fight with two assailants, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who had not been identified Sunday evening, underwent surgery at UCI 
Medical Center in Orange for a gunshot wound in his chest and was in critical 
condition, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The attackers are still at large, Garden Grove Police Sgt. Dale Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim had been standing beside his car in Target's parking lot on 
Brookhurst Street when he got in a fight with two other men, said Sgt. Michael 
Walker. During the brawl, which took place about 2:30 p.m., one man shot him 
once in the chest, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said that the victim then got into his car and started to drive toward 
the parking lot exit. After driving about half a block, he lost control of the 
vehicle, ran into a curb and slammed into a three-foot-high cinder-block wall, 
which separates the lot from a sidewalk on Brookhurst Street. 
</P>
<P>
The driver was transported by helicopter to UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
One 18-year-old witness, who declined to be identified, fearing reprisals from 
area gangs, said he was in the lot when he heard the shot. He said he saw a 
slender, long-haired man running away behind Target's lawn and garden 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Another 18-year-old witness, who gave his name only as "Chuy," said that he 
heard one shot and saw the man running but at first "didn't think anything of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded like (the victim) ran over something," Chuy said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he started walking into the store because no one in the lot was in any 
panic. "No one was screaming," he said. "No one was saying 'Someone's been 
shot.' " 
</P>
<P>
But then he saw that the victim's car had slammed into the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Police are so far unsure whether the incident was gang-related, Farley said.

<P>
While an entourage of elected officials and business people are in Europe this 
week surveying potential trains for the Anaheim-Las Vegas line, financing to 
launch the project has begun. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim City Council recently voted to allocate $200,000 to help finance 
the search for a public contractor. 
</P>
<P>
In Nevada, the city of Las Vegas, the Convention/Visitors Authority and Clark 
County each donated $270,000 to the project, and the state chipped in $120,000. 
In addition, a federal grant offered $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's all we're planning on asking for," said Paul Taylor, executive 
director of the bistate commission in charge of the project. The commission 
will begin evaluating proposals in July, and hopes to award a contract by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
If that process should snag, Anaheim city officials say that they will likely 
continue to financially help the commission during these initial stages. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the council members are concerned, they see it as an investment," 
said Greg Trombley, administrative services coordinator for the public works 
department. 
</P>
<P>
City officials see the increased accessibility to the Disneyland-Convention 
Center area as beneficial to the city, especially in terms of sales tax 
revenues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Don R. Roth, who is vice chairman of the commission in California, 
said he hoped Anaheim residents would focus on the long-term gains of the 
project, rather than the relatively smaller short-term loss of city funds. 
</P>
<P>
However, city and county officials would not venture to estimate how much 
Anaheim or other entities might ultimately contribute for the train. LISA

<P>
LONG ARM OF LAW REACHES OUT TO BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Stotz remembered the police officer who visited his school last year to 
talk to the students about drugs. 
</P>
<P>
So when Eric moved to Connecticut and found himself in a strange place among 
strangers, he spoke fondly of that memory. As a result, the Huntington Beach 
officer wrote a five-page letter to Eric, now a fifth-grader, about the 
officer's own move to a new town in the fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
It all came about when a D.A.R.E. officer visiting the Huckleberry Hill 
Elementary School in Brookfield, Conn., happened to meet Eric, who talked about 
his teachers back home at Oka Elementary School in Huntington Beach. Then the 
boy particularly mentioned the officer he had come to know in the fourth grade 
when the officer visited his school. 
</P>
<P>
The Connecticut officer wrote to Oka school, asking the name of the D.A.R.E. 
officer who had so impressed Eric and whether he might drop a note to the boy. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach officer, Michael Corcoran, responded with a five-page, 
typewritten letter to Eric, describing his own boyhood experience when his 
family moved to a Northern California town, just as he was entering the fifth 
grade. He wrote about how his new classmates teased him because he wore 
glasses, the fights he got into and how it took most of the year before he 
found a friend. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to let Eric know that when I was in the fifth grade, I went 
through the same thing," Corcoran said. "The main thing, with me, was I was 
trying too hard to be liked. So, I just tried to tell him to calm down and be 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Corcoran, who has spent the past three of his 22 years as a police officer in 
the Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) program, recalled Eric as a 
likable boy with whom he had a rapport. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're out at a school, during lunch and recess there are some kids who 
every day come up and say hi," he said. "He was one of those kids, one of those 
friendly kinds of kids." 
</P>
<P>
Corcoran said he has kept in touch with other students after their families 
moved, "but none quite as dramatic as moving 3,000 miles away." 
</P>
<P>
Such cases, he said, make his current job more rewarding than any other police 
work he has done. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the typical teacher lot," he said. "You're mingling with children 
all the time, and then one day one of your (former) students shows up and says 
he's the president of a company or something. Every once in a while something 
like that will happen, and it makes you think that maybe you are doing a 
halfway decent job." JOHN PENNER

<TEXT>
<P>
Surgeons have implanted a heart pacemaker into an ailing kangaroo at the San 
Francisco Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Middle-aged, 80-pound Skippy is believed to be the first zoo animal to receive 
a pacemaker, zoo officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery was performed last week by three heart surgeons and four 
anesthesiologists. 
</P>
<P>
A zoo spokeswoman said Wednesday that Skippy, 7 years old, was in guarded 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Sulak, the zoo's curator of mammals, said the kangaroo had a heartbeat of 
only 18 to 40 beats per minute before surgery, far slower than the normal 125 
to 150 range.

<P>
TOP-FLIGHT BALLPARK HAS STRIKE AGAINST IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As far as the city's softball enthusiasts are concerned, the sports complex at 
Richard T. Steed Memorial Park looks great. 
</P>
<P>
Before four well-trimmed, lighted diamonds were opened last summer, the city's 
recreational league players put up with infield rocks and outfield gopher holes 
at run-down fields that were nonetheless the best San Clemente had to offer. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I feel like I'm playing in Dodger Stadium," said Edwin Powell, a 
34-year-old shortstop in one of several leagues using the facility. "This park 
is a real gem compared to some of the places we've used." 
</P>
<P>
But when city officials look at the park, located at the edge of the scenic 
rolling hills of east San Clemente, they see a stack of unpaid bills. 
</P>
<P>
Since the complex opened in July, contractors have been knocking on the doors 
of City Hall, asking for more than $220,000 they say is owed them for building 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
And when South Coast Sports Enterprises, the developer/operator of the park, 
declared bankruptcy Jan. 23, the construction firms found themselves reduced to 
standing in line for a share of a $55,000 deposit left with the city. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials are holding onto the deposit, saying that the money will be 
distributed by a bankruptcy judge. 
</P>
<P>
"They will all have to wait for the bankruptcy hearing," which is as yet 
unscheduled, said City Atty. Jeff Oderman. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the city agreed to lease park land for development as a sports park by 
South Coast Enterprises. The deal -- unique in Orange County, city officials 
say -- called for the management group to build the softball complex and 
operate a year-round league program. 
</P>
<P>
But the project ran into financial trouble, and the city agreed last spring to 
give the firm a $75,000 rent credit. 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, to the delight of the city's softball players, the complex 
opened for play. 
</P>
<P>
Within months, however, creditors began contacting the city with complaints 
over unpaid bills. 
</P>
<P>
When they began filing legal claims against City Hall, the City Council took 
action in January to void South Coast's lease and take over the park. 
</P>
<P>
The move forced the firm into bankruptcy to protect its almost $900,000 
investment in the sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no choice," said Steve Boehm, one of the firm's principal partners. 
"The City Council didn't have to do this." 
</P>
<P>
Boehm blamed cost overruns during construction on turnover in city staff over 
the past five years. The new city officials required more stringent and costly 
improvements than those outlined in verbal agreements with the previous regime, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Bruce Wegener, a city recreation director, says the city required no more 
than what was originally promised by South Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they would build a top-flight quality park," he said. "And we held 
them to that." 
</P>
<P>
Boehm said a new backer has been found who will settle all claims once he is 
approved by the firm's limited partners. 
</P>
<P>
Wegener said he hopes the sports firm can get back on track, but added that the 
city is "capable of stepping in" and operating the park. FRANK MESSINA

PARK PACT AIDS CHEVRON, CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The oil derricks that pump along Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington Beach have 
always seemed strangely out of place along the lovely shoreline. But they are 
especially so these days for a city trying to polish its image as a tourism and 
convention site after last month's offshore oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
But an agreement just announced between the city and Chevron USA, a company 
whose derricks are near where workers had to mop up British Petroleum's oil 
after the spill, is certain to polish the city's oceanfront facade. It will 
result in the capping of 25 oil wells and the removal of derrick equipment to 
make way for a bluff-top park. 
</P>
<P>
Parks before oil derricks -- now there's an image that fits in the 
environmentally conscious 1990s. The agreement scores a public relations point 
for Chevron and also strikes a good deal for the oil company, which retains the 
rights to do slant drilling at some unspecified future date and gets the city 
to contribute up to $650,000 of the cost of the closure. 
</P>
<P>
It may be true that the more than $1 million worth of oil the company says 
remains untapped is a relatively insignificant amount. But the gesture is a 
positive step, nonetheless, because it works for the city's benefit. What 
Huntington Beach must be careful to do is use its power of planning and 
regulation wisely later on -- when and if the oil company exercises its option 
to put in directionally drilled wells. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Huntington Beach will get its park, and remove some of the 
concerns about safety that have accompanied pedestrian traffic near the wells. 
The city's efforts to close a similar deal with Shell Oil Co., which still has 
four wells operating in the area, should be made easier by the Chevron 
agreement. In the process, Huntington Beach is demonstrating for other cities 
in the Los Angeles basin with active oil fields that there are creative ways to 
balance land use with the presence of oil reserves.

EVEN 'VERY NICE LADY' MAY BE DRUG USER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few weeks after giving birth to her first child, a 32-year-old Tustin 
advertising executive wondered why she could not comfort the inconsolably 
cranky newborn. Her pediatrician referred her to Tim Healy, a pediatric 
physical therapist who often treats drug babies. 
</P>
<P>
After coming to trust that Healy would not report her, she told him what she 
had revealed to neither her doctor nor the hospital where she had given birth: 
She had snorted cocaine four times recreationally during her pregnancy. Now she 
wondered whether that might have caused the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The answer, Healy replied, was yes. 
</P>
<P>
The story illustrates the changing profile of the pregnant drug user, which 
authorities believe has resulted in under-reporting of drug-exposed babies. 
</P>
<P>
They said that doctors in affluent areas such as Orange County are unwilling to 
report cocaine use among their white, middle-class patients. 
</P>
<P>
"In the patient who looks like a real quality person, you tend not to ask," 
said Roger Schlesinger, president of the Orange County Obstetrical and 
Gynecological Society. "Maybe there's a bit of denial; they don't believe this 
very nice lady could be a weekend cocaine user." 
</P>
<P>
Most physicians were not trained in an era of heavy drug use, said Judy Howard, 
a pediatrician and researcher at the UCLA School of Medicine. "They're very 
ignorant about middle- and upper-middle-class substance abuse." 
</P>
<P>
According to a nationwide survey of hospitals by the Chicago-based National 
Assn. for Perinatal Addiction Research and Education (NAPARE), 11% of all 
newborns have been affected by their mothers' use of cocaine during pregnancy, 
and the statistics cut through all levels of income and education. 
</P>
<P>
"It's surprising and shocking to people who thought we just didn't have this 
problem in beautiful downtown Camelot," said Dr. Willard Blankenship, director 
of neonatology at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. 
The hospital, which serves the largely affluent South County, has identified 
more drug babies in the past year than in the previous five years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of hospital medical directors and nursing managers conducted last 
summer by a group of public and private children's organizations in Orange 
County concluded that of an estimated 1,248 Orange County children born exposed 
to drugs each year, only a quarter are reported to authorities. The estimates 
were arrived at through interviews with hospital administrators and nursing 
supervisors who observe newborns firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 24 Orange County hospitals surveyed, only 11 have written policies 
regarding urine toxicology tests on mothers or babies, while the rest rely on 
the individual doctors, said Mary Harris, program analyst for the county Social 
Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Most reserve testing for only the most obvious cases, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Without early identification of a drug-using mother and a drug-exposed infant, 
bonding between mother and child is often impaired. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with addiction is: Parents have one priority and that is to their 
addiction," Howard said. "They are only intermittently available to the baby. 
And if there's anyone in a dependent state, it's a baby. 
</P>
<P>
"You're setting up a situation for neglect and overt abuse," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Hospital tests for drugs only upon noticeable signs and symptoms and 
does not routinely test because drug testing has been considered an invasion of 
privacy, Blankenship said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said a doctor-patient relationship might be destroyed if a patient 
receives a bill for a drug test after denying using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
However, recent court decisions have appeared to strengthen the position of 
hospitals that report mothers to child-abuse authorities if their newborns test 
positive to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the state Supreme Court upheld an Oceanside hospital that had 
reported a mother to child-protection authorities after obtaining positive 
tests for amphetamines and opiates on both the mother and the newborn son. As a 
result, the Juvenile Court took custody of the child. 
</P>
<P>
While the mother had complained of an invasion of privacy, the court stated 
that prenatal use of dangerous drugs constitutes evidence of future child 
neglect. 
</P>
<P>
Schlesinger said he routinely tests pregnant women who come to an emergency 
room to deliver with no prenatal care and also those in his Fullerton practice 
who admit using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
He said he asks all his patients "in a casual, nonjudgmental fashion" whether 
they are using cocaine, alcohol or marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm often surprised when talking to people who appear to be nice, stable 
folks," he said, "how many positive responses there are to using street drugs. 
</P>
<P>
While cocaine use among pregnant women may be significantly under-reported, 
Schlesinger believes it has not caused much of a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless someone is really a pretty heavy user, you don't see problems in the 
babies," he said. Others disagree. 
</P>
<P>
A hit of cocaine causes a rise in the mother's blood pressure, constricting the 
blood flow to the fetus and putting it at risk of stroke or inhibited 
development, said Pat O'Keefe, director of communications for the Chicago-based 
research association. 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine also causes the onset of contractions, therefore promoting premature 
births with all their attendant problems, she said.

MATER DEI PLAYERS PROVE THEY KNOW SCORE TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before they played in the Southern California Regional Division I boys' 
basketball championship game Friday night, Long Beach Poly players reminded 
Mater Dei of their previous meeting this season. 
</P>
<P>
During warmups, Poly players wore T-shirts with a scoreboard on it that read: 
"Poly 54, Mater Dei 47," the final score in the Tournament of Champions final 
in December. Printed underneath the scoreboard was "Tournament of Champions 
champion." 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids all noticed the shirts," Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight said. "I told 
the kids, 'If they take that much pride in beating us that they put the score 
on a shirt, then it's a tribute to us.' I thought they (Poly) were kind of 
saying, 'In your face.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei got the best of Poly Friday night, however. Jason Quinn's off-balance 
three-point basket with 1.8 seconds left gave the Monarchs a 46-45 victory. 
</P>
<P>
No T-shirts have been designed for Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Add Mater Dei: McKnight was exhausted Saturday morning. He had just coached his 
team to three playoff victories in the last four days against some of the 
toughest competition in the state. 
</P>
<P>
So how did he relax? He and assistant coaches Dave Taylor and Phil Bellomo flew 
to San Francisco Saturday to scout San Francisco Riordan's 80-60 victory over 
Oakland Skyline in the Northern California Regional Division I finals. Mater 
Dei (33-1) will play Riordan in the state championship game at 7 p.m. Saturday 
at the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"The northern regional was very comparable to the south," McKnight said. 
"Riordan is very balanced, very comparable to us. We should match up well." 
</P>
<P>
The scouting trip capped a long week of basketball for McKnight. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen so much basketball in the last week," McKnight said. "I watched a 
tape of the Poly game and I saw two tired teams out there. David Boyle ran by 
the bench three minutes into the game and his tongue was hanging out. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat the 3-A City champs (North Hollywood), the 4-A City champs (Manual 
Arts) and the (Southern Section) 5-AA champs (Poly) in a four-day span. That 
was a tough road for us. I'm really proud of the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Hold the pineapple: In case you were wondering, here's what the Dos Pueblos 
basketball players ordered on their pizzas Friday night: pepperoni, mushrooms, 
sausage and pineapple. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the Chargers' 12 players, including four starters, suffered from food 
poisoning, presumably from the pizzas, and lost to Servite Saturday in the 
Southern California Regional Division III title game. Leading scorer Chris 
Gaines missed the first half because he was sick. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the pineapple was the problem," Charger forward Adam Estabrook said. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Aunt Carol: Last week, Brea-Olinda girls' Coach Mark Trakh got a strange 
welcome from several seventh- and eighth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
"I go to my junior high basketball class and I've got these kids coming up to 
me saying, 'Hey, are you going to be the men's coach at North Carolina State?' 
" Trakh said. 
</P>
<P>
"I just played along with the joke and said, 'Yeah, I'm going to get $80,000 a 
year. How did you guys find out? It was supposed to be a secret.' " 
</P>
<P>
A reply from one of the students: "My Aunt Carol told me." 
</P>
<P>
It seems Aunt Carol was watching a cable telecast of a Brea-Olinda game and 
announcers pegged Trakh as a replacement for Coach Jim Valvano. Valvano's 
future at North Carolina State has been in question since an NCAA investigation 
and allegations of point-shaving. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the telecast, the announcer asked if I was going to be here (Brea) next 
year or if I was looking for a college job," Trakh said. "In jest, I said, 'If 
Valvano gets fired I'll be there. They said, 'I look like him, so they're going 
to hire me.' 
</P>
<P>
"So the (announcer) doesn't even crack a smile and that night in the telecast 
it was reported that I was being considered for the job and it was all a quip. 
It was a joke and it was taken seriously." 
</P>
<P>
At least by Aunt Carol. 
</P>
<P>
Star search: The Lakers and Kings aren't the only teams drawing famous fans 
lately. In attendance at a recent Brea-Olinda girls' basketball game were 
Angels Wally Joyner and Dick Schofield and former Angel Rick Burleson. 
</P>
<P>
Trakh said Burleson has attended a couple of Brea's games. He brought Joyner 
and Schofield along Thursday night for Brea's Southern California Regional 
Division III girls' semifinal victory over Lemoore. 
</P>
<P>
Why the interest? 
</P>
<P>
Burleson owns a center in Orange County where some of the Brea-Olinda players 
go for physical therapy, Trakh said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Amigos basketball Coach Famous Hooks has resigned because of personal 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
He had a 33-58 record in four years at Los Amigos. His best season was 15-11 in 
1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
Hooks will continue to teach at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Shad Vickers earned a reputation as a tough running back during his junior 
season at Irvine High School, but he will change uniforms, and possibly 
positions, as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Vickers, a 5-foot-10, 170-pounder, transferred from Irvine to Tustin when his 
family moved into Tustin's district during the semester break. 
</P>
<P>
Vickers gained 698 yards in 171 carries and scored six touchdowns last season 
at Irvine. Coach Marijon Ancich said Vickers could fit in at a number of 
positions with Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
"He has running-back ability and was an exceptional wide receiver as a 
sophomore," Ancich said. "And with his speed (4.5 seconds in the 40-yard dash) 
he can play in the defensive secondary. They didn't use him on defense much at 
Irvine, but we plan to try him there." 
</P>
<P>
No matter where he plays, Vickers will be a welcome addition for the Tillers 
(7-5), who reached the Southern Section Division VI quarterfinals last season. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a good work ethic," Ancich said. "You get some of these transfers and 
they're hard to live with. But he will fit right in. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fortunate to get a guy of this caliber." 
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
Krista Hartling, a member of The Times' All-County volleyball team, has 
accepted a scholarship to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Hartling, a 5-4 outside 
hitter, averaged nine kills and three blocks a game last season. . . . Former 
University High runner Greg Whiteley has qualified for the International 
Amateur Athletic Federation World Cross-Country championships March 25 in 
France. Whiteley, who graduated from Brown last year, finished ninth in the 
U.S. cross-country trials Feb. 10 to qualify.

STAR-CROSS'D CASTING THROWS A WRENCH INTO 'ROMEO AND JULIET' ROMANCE AT CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Star-cross'd casting kept a weekend of American Ballet Theatre "Romeo and 
Juliet" performances in Costa Mesa only fitfully satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
Now familiar from stage, screen and television, Kenneth MacMillan's 1965 dance 
drama earned its reputation through inspired collaborations -- initially, of 
course, between Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev, but also Lynn Seymour and 
Christopher Gable, for whom the ballet was choreographed. Ballet Theatre, 
however, seems to assume that Romeo, Mercutio and Benvolio are interchangeable 
roles -- and that audiences somehow don't notice when the the lovers are cast 
from cynical (or is it desperate?) expediency. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, pairing Julio Bocca with Alessandra Ferriq on Friday was pretty much 
the same as marrying Juliet off to Paris. Bocca is a brilliant virtuoso but 
scarcely ideal for Romeo either in physical proportions, partnering ability or 
acting skill. In contrast, Ferri is one of the great Juliets of our time, a 
dancing actress of astonishing originality who creates a specific reality in 
each performance -- one that Bocca's bland obviousness continually 
contradicted. 
</P>
<P>
When this Juliet danced, it was always a declaration to her Romeo -- while he 
invariably remained absorbed in showing off feats to the audience. They even 
clashed in death: Bocca's stylized throes and soft, slow, self-protective fall 
to the floor versus Ferri's wild explosion of suicidal despair. 
</P>
<P>
The Saturday matinee leads proved no more compatible -- but they, at least, 
were thrown together by happenstance. Scheduled to dance with other partners, 
Leslie Browne and Wes Chapman found themselves cast opposite one another in 
this ballet for the first time because of an injury to Browne's designated 
Romeo (Ricardo Bustamante). 
</P>
<P>
They responded like pros, of course. Chapman partnered conscientiously, soloed 
capably (though some of the bravura looked underpowered) and showed promise of 
developing a notably sweet and refined characterization: Romeo as dream-prince. 
On this occasion, Browne muted her distinctively sophisticated and contemporary 
interpretation (very post-Seymour) but danced faultlessly. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Kevin McKenzie made a mature, almost world-weary Romeo 
renewed by the virginal innocence of Amanda McKerrow's Juliet -- more like 
Albrecht and Giselle, perhaps, than these Montague and Capulet lovers, but 
clearly the most potent combination of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Although a strained actor, McKenzie had strength and generosity as a partner 
that always made a powerful statement on its own terms -- and it allowed 
McKerrow maximum daring in the great duets. Unlike Ferri and Browne, she didn't 
show Juliet growing wiser or deeper from adversity: She died the same child 
we'd seen playing with a doll. But in her purity of belief and vulnerability, 
she broke your heart. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond showcasing its tragic lovers, MacMillan's "Romeo and Juliet" represents 
a spectacular company vehicle and these first Orange County performances 
boasted a number of high-profile portrayals. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most artful: Georgina Parkinson's alternately steely and volcanic 
Lady Capulet (Friday and Saturday nights), Victor Barbee's complex, formidable 
Tybalt (Friday), Alexander Minz's cerebral Friar Laurence (Friday and Saturday 
evening) and Kathleen Moore's grandmotherly Nurse (Friday and the Saturday 
matinee). 
</P>
<P>
Guillaume Graffin danced unevenly in his first performance as Benvolio (Friday) 
-- but in looks and temperament this is clearly a born Romeo paying his dues. 
As Mercutio, both Johan Renvall (Friday and Saturday afternoon) and John 
Gardner (Saturday evening) settled for lightweight, boyish interpretations put 
over with sharply honed technique. Michael Owen made a conventionally brutish 
Tybalt (Saturday afternoon) and Kevin O'Day (Saturday night) turned the 
character into Brandoesque trade, obviously waiting around Verona for someone 
to invent the motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Everly and Charles Barker alternated as conductor in the three 
performances. Sign of progress: The Mandolin Dance solo in Act II is no longer 
Mercutio's property but belongs, as MacMillan originally intended, to a 
divertissement dancer (Robert Wallace at the first two performances, then Keith 
Roberts). It makes so much more sense that way.

IRVINE'S PUBLIC-ART PROGRAM HAS PROBLEMS GROWING UP 
</P>

<P>
When you're in a museum, you know the rules: No touching, no doodling, no 
climbing on stuff, or the guards will come running. But outdoors it's a 
different story. There's no one around to police you, no decorum you've been 
trained to follow. 
</P>
<P>
If you saw a sculpture in a public garden or plaza, you would certainly feel 
free to touch it. Depending on its shape and size, children would be likely to 
sit on it, swing from it or balance on it. If it yielded to the touch of a 
penknife, teen-agers might try to cut their initials in it. If it had flat 
surfaces, bored and restless types might be tempted to embroider it with spray 
paint. 
</P>
<P>
Public art -- long a target of public outcry -- is also a sitting duck for 
physical interaction. The nature of that interaction depends primarily on how 
welcoming or hostile the art appears to the viewer and the types of activities 
suggested by its contours, materials and size. 
</P>
<P>
Recent events in Irvine -- which has been attempting unsuccessfully to 
implement a public-art program for several years -- suggest that city employees 
are confused about what's entailed in placing sculpture out of doors in a 
public area and calling it "public art." 
</P>
<P>
Angie Bray's "Wavering Poles" -- a group of 54 hollow aluminum poles in 
graduated sizes from 3 1/2 to 8 1/2 feet, anchored with flexible steel joints 
to a flagstone base -- was recently removed from the temporary "Sculpture on 
View" exhibit on the Plaza of the Irvine Civic Center because city officials 
claimed that it was potentially dangerous. The city's argument was that the 
slanted tops of the poles might cause injury if someone pulled on them. 
</P>
<P>
Bray, who says "Wavering Poles" is meant to be played with -- and also to 
respond to and reflect changes in air circulation and light -- had submitted 
photographs, a description and a diagram of her piece to the city. No one in 
the city or FHP Healthcare, which is co-sponsoring the exhibit, raised any 
objections until the sculpture was installed late last month. 
</P>
<P>
The delicate-looking piece was incongruously surrounded by stanchions and 
police barrier tape, removed for the opening ceremony to make things look as 
though all was well, and replaced as soon as the public and press took their 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, we live in a litigious age. It behooves the guardians of our public 
places to guard against injury on their turf, if only to ward off long and 
costly legal battles. But the watchwords should be consistency and 
reasonableness. 
</P>
<P>
If the sharp-edged metal light fixtures alongside the steps of the plaza are 
OK, a work of sculpture with similar properties shouldn't be condemned. There 
should be a clear set of safety guidelines for public sculpture, and they 
should be implemented in the planning stages of an exhibition, not after a work 
of art has been installed. 
</P>
<P>
Just before she removed "Wavering Poles" from the plaza, Bray noticed that 
while children were pulling gently on the poles in her piece, watching them 
sway and tap one another, they approached the other pieces with a different 
kind of energy. 
</P>
<P>
Children shimmied up two nine-foot-tall steel pieces, Bret Price's "Passage" 
and Daniel Miller's "Wandering Mobius." They jumped off Joyce Kohl's 
three-foot-tall concrete work, "Two-Square," threw the gravel inside Pat 
Warner's "Earth Wheel" and plunked their little bodies on its slim wooden 
"spokes," which do not seem to have been designed as weight-bearing components 
of the piece. 
</P>
<P>
"Each piece invites people to do something," Bray said. "My piece does not 
invite people to be violent; it invites them to be contemplative and gentle. 
</P>
<P>
"If the city . . . had certain expections of the viewer, why isn't the viewer 
made aware of them? Why were pieces picked that clearly invited viewers to do 
things that were forbidden?" 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, every public-art program is entitled to its growing pains. But 
Irvine's program remains a gangly adolescent that seemingly won't listen to the 
voice of experience. 
</P>
<P>
The city's involvement in public art began in 1984, when the City Council 
appointed an Art in Public Places advisory board. After much palaver and 
requisite fanfare, it commissioned a piece for Heritage Park by Los Angeles 
sculptor Mark Lere. The piece, installed in 1988, became a hymn to the Irvine 
Co., in which 21 of the 50 inscriptions carved into the artist's spiral of 
tiles symbolizing "time" refer to the corporate entity. 
</P>
<P>
The board's second venture into public art was Art Spaces '87, a program that 
borrowed six undistinguished works from six artists -- including a brother of 
one of the board members -- and plopped them down in various outdoor city 
locations for a one-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, an Irvine resident whose family owns numerous pieces by Jack Zajac, 
a Southern California sculptor whose star was bright in decades past, received 
permission to install them for five months at the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Corporate Patrons (a membership group of Art Spaces Irvine, the 
advisory board's fund-raising wing) decided to donate $4,500 to purchase a hunk 
of marble for emigre artist Marton Varo to carve one of his blandly derivative 
figurative tableaux. 
</P>
<P>
These various and sundry activities do not add up to the kind of public-art 
program likely to put a city on the cultural map. 
</P>
<P>
Should we be sympathetic because the program -- hatched by the city but without 
public financial support -- has had to beg for corporate and private donations? 
</P>
<P>
Hardly, considering the personal and corporate wealth waiting to be tapped. A 
more logical response is sheer impatience because the program still has no 
proper leadership. No respected art professional is associated with the 
program, no one who has significant experience with public art, wide-ranging 
knowledge of the sophisticated world of contemporary sculpture and a genuinely 
broad and innovative vision. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Thorne, the city's current part-time public art consultant, is dedicated 
and well-meaning, but she has an unsubstantial background in art and lacks the 
requisite clout. It remains to be seen what clout and direction will be 
forthcoming from the city's fledgling Cultural Affairs Commission, whose 
members include Peggy Mears, former director of the Irvine Fine Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Viewed simply as an outdoor-indoor exhibition (pieces by three artists are in 
the Civic Center lobby), "Sculpture on View" is not exactly a show-stopper. The 
cheekiest of the works still on view is Leslie Robbins' two-part "Modern 
Times": a telephone pole that leans crookedly against the building and a small 
plaster and cement cross-shaped piece that sits nearby on the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Although the meaning of the smaller piece remains unclear, the pole sends a big 
raspberry to the cleanly anonymous architecture of the building and the broad, 
blank plaza -- and, by extension, to the airbrushed image of the 19-year-old 
master-planned city. Considering that Irvine actually has no working telephone 
poles -- the cables are all buried underground -- the image seems even more 
apropos. 
</P>
<P>
O you city of the future, where the most grievous sin is to be unsightly, and 
where folks must be protected against the small urges that overtake them when 
face-to-face with public art. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sculpture on View" -- with work in the lobby and on the plaza by Joyce Kohl, 
Daniel Miller, Bret Price, Karen Innes Reid, Leslie Robbins, Dunnieghe Slawson, 
Richard Turner and Pat Warner, remains through July 13 at the Irvine Civic 
Center.

GORBACHEV PROPOSES NEW PARTY RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, attempting to remake the Soviet Communist Party 
to meet growing demands for democracy, on Sunday proposed new party rules that 
will reverse decades of top-down organization characteristic of communism and 
turn it into a party dependent on grass-roots support for its strength. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, addressing a meeting of the party's policy-making Central Committee 
in the Kremlin, also reaffirmed the need for the Communists to yield their long 
monopoly on political power here, and compete for popular support with other 
parties in free elections, if they are ever to mobilize the people. 
</P>
<P>
However, he just as firmly upheld the party's orientation as distinctly 
Communist, not socialist or social democratic. He insisted that the party 
retain its unified, national structure rather than become a federation of 
independent parties of the country's constituent republics. 
</P>
<P>
Observing the fifth anniversary of his election as the party's general 
secretary, Gorbachev laid out a bold program of internal reform to reinvigorate 
the 18.8-million-member Soviet party and keep it in power, even as the 
Communist parties in other socialist countries collapse. 
</P>
<P>
These changes will not come easily, Gorbachev said, for if successful they will 
bring a fundamental realignment of power in the party and then in the nation as 
a whole. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the party's regional first secretaries, who for decades have been 
appointed by Moscow to rule over areas as large as many countries, will in the 
future be elected at local party congresses -- and then have to lead the party 
in regional elections against opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
But the new party rules effectively rejected demands by many reformers for the 
abolition of the city and regional party committees and the networks of 
committees subordinate to them. Gorbachev said the fate of the Communist 
parties in Eastern Europe demonstrated the danger of dissolving party 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The new party rules, which have gone through more than 40 drafts already, could 
still encounter serious opposition during the Central Committee meeting, which 
continues today. The summary of the first day's debate showed that many 
prominent conservatives, some of them regional leaders, had spoken, but no 
details were given. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, however, has again effectively "packed" the meeting by inviting 
about 300 guests to join the 248 Central Committee members in their 
deliberations, although the guests may not vote. 
</P>
<P>
The urgency for such internal party reforms -- if they, in fact, are not too 
late -- was underlined dramatically as the newly elected Parliament of 
Lithuania voted later Sunday to re-establish its independence and thus begin 
the process of secession from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has waged a personal campaign to keep Lithuania within the Soviet 
Union, moving even faster toward a multi-party political system and promising a 
new federal structure for the country to persuade the republic and other 
nationalists to remain. 
</P>
<P>
But the latest reforms, which will be debated further in the months leading up 
to the party congress opening here July 2, look toward a long-term 
transformation of the political system rather than quick changes. 
</P>
<P>
"The rationale behind revamping the rules," Gorbachev told the Central 
Committee, according to a summary of his hourlong speech from the official news 
agency Tass, "is to make the party member the focus of party life by 
guaranteeing him the broadest possibilities to share in charting and 
implementing party policy, shaping higher party bodies and supervising their 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
The reforms appear to fall short, however, of requiring rank-and-file election 
of all 4,700 delegates to the party congress in July -- a measure that would 
prevent local party leaders from sending only their own people -- although the 
reforms do promise "real autonomy" following adoption of the new rules and 
party program. 
</P>
<P>
At present, the party's role as "the leader and guider of Soviet society and 
the nucleus of its political system, of all state organizations and public 
organizations" is guaranteed by the Soviet constitution. 
</P>
<P>
This monopoly on political power will end later this week when the Congress of 
People's Deputies, the national Parliament, amends the constitution to 
guarantee the equality of all political movements and public organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The retreat from absolute power is essential, Gorbachev contended Sunday -- as 
he did last month when the Central Committee first endorsed the change -- if 
the Soviet Union is to reform its political and economic system and involve all 
elements of society in the effort. 
</P>
<P>
The Congress, which meets today, is also scheduled to consider more 
constitutional amendments establishing an executive presidency with broad 
powers -- a post designed to give Gorbachev the authority that his supporters 
assert he needs to press ahead with perestroika, as his reform program is 
known. 
</P>
<P>
"What is needed now is a strong power," Sergei Shatalin, a leading economist 
and Gorbachev adviser, told Soviet television during a recess in the Kremlin 
meeting. "Of course, we may have different viewpoints on this and other issues 
-- some from the right, others from the left -- but we should strive to take a 
left-centrist position today." 
</P>
<P>
Members from the radical Inter-Regional Group of Deputies decided on Sunday, 
however, to oppose the presidential amendments, contending that they create too 
powerful a position with insufficient checks and that the country must first 
agree on the new relationship between the central government and the 
constituent ethnic republics. 
</P>
<P>
But the group will not oppose Gorbachev's election once the post has been 
created. They said they dispute the need for the new powers, not Gorbachev's 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party newspaper Pravda, reviewing Gorbachev's five years as the 
country's leader, said Sunday that with executive powers, which he does not 
have now as the party's general secretary and the chairman of the Congress of 
People's Deputies, he would be able to "act as a powerful consolidating force 
in our society." 
</P>
<P>
"Energetic activity in this direction is the guarantee of further acceleration 
in the process of restructuring, in the resolution of acute political, social 
and economic problems," Pravda said. 
</P>
<P>
Replying to Gorbachev's critics, who now complain loudly that five years of 
reform have brought political chaos and no real economic gains, Pravda said 
that, compared to the situation in 1985, the country's progress has been 
greater than anyone could have envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
"We have come a tremendous distance over a short period," Pravda said, "in 
democratization and political openness, in transforming our economy, in our 
national self-awareness, in establishing the new political mentality, in giving 
priority to common human values in the international arena and in freeing the 
creative powers of human beings, which although a goal in itself also 
guarantees the continuing revolutionary changes." 
</P>
<P>
But the progress has not been trouble-free, Pravda admitted. 
</P>
<P>
"Mistakes were inescapable," the editorial said. "They occurred because of the 
incompetence of some people, resistance from others. They were made because of 
irresoluteness and because of undue haste. 
</P>
<P>
"Economic miscalculations manifested themselves. . . . Certain campaigns, such 
as the one against alcoholism or against 'unearned incomes,' proved 
ill-considered and hastily organized 'cavalry charges.' " 
</P>
<P>
The widespread pessimism now, the paper said, reflects "a concern about what 
was done wrong or not at all," but it ignores the changes that "have 
transformed our country beyond recognition -- and the fact that it will never 
be the same again." 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev, addressing such criticism within the party itself, argued 
strongly that neither the blunders of past decades nor the mistakes in recent 
years invalidated socialism as a political system nor the Communist Party as 
its "vanguard." 
</P>
<P>
"Much is being said now about the party having allegedly become obsolete and 
needing to be replaced by another party of an intrinsically different quality," 
Gorbachev said. "It is being suggested in this connection that the party should 
be renamed social democratic, socialist or otherwise. The idea basically is to 
strip the party's name of the word 'Communist,' which stems from its ultimate 
ideal and long-term tasks. 
</P>
<P>
"This proposal must not be accepted. Its implementation would be a serious blow 
at the party's ideological foundation and disappoint many party members and 
non-party people who support the Communist Party as a party of lofty ideals."

DRIVE FOR CLEANER AUTOS RUNNING INTO OBSTACLES 
</P>

<P>
When a new clean air plan was adopted last year to rid the Los Angeles Basin of 
health-threatening smog levels within a generation, authorities were counting 
on millions of cars powered by clean-burning fuels to help make it work. 
</P>
<P>
Methanol-powered cars, they said, were just around the corner, and 
"ultra-clean" vehicles propelled by even cleaner fuels weren't far behind. 
</P>
<P>
Now, nearly a year later, car showrooms clearly are not brimming with 
alternative-fuel cars. Still, air pollution officials insist that they are on 
track and that, despite setbacks in Congress and challenges by industry, four 
out of every 10 cars on the road will run on cleaner fuels by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
In one sense, prospects have never seemed brighter. General Motors has unveiled 
the prototype of a futuristic electric car that accelerates from 0 to 60 m.p.h. 
in eight seconds and has a range of 124 miles between recharges. 
</P>
<P>
Last week PG&amp;E opened the state's first public refueling station for 
vehicles that run on compressed natural gas -- by far the cleanest of fossil 
fuels. And Arco last September began marketing a reformulated gasoline, called 
EC-1, for pre-1975 cars that cuts their tailpipe emissions by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the state Air Resources Board is poised to require automobile 
companies beginning in 1994 to begin selling a new category of "low emitting" 
vehicles that are twice as clean as the cleanest new gasoline cars on the road. 
</P>
<P>
But there are obstacles on the road. 
</P>
<P>
GM has no target date for actually mass producing its electric car. Given 
existing battery technology, it would cost twice as much to operate as a 
gasoline car. And there are a relative handful of vehicles that run on natural 
gas. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, while state government appears determined to charge ahead with ever 
more stringent tailpipe standards that will eventually force gasoline and 
diesel vehicles off the road, Congress is putting on the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
After a fast start by the Bush Administration in calling for the production of 
a million alternative fuel cars a year by 1997, Senate negotiators -- with 
White House acquiescence -- have all but scrapped the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Where do these conflicting signals leave California? Will new generations of 
super-clean vehicles really be on the road soon enough for the Los Angeles 
Basin to meet federal clean air health standards in the 17 years that are left 
before a 2007 deadline? 
</P>
<P>
Although the Senate compromise drew fire from environmentalists, some members 
of Congress and air pollution authorities, it is not viewed as a major setback 
even if it remains intact. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of what happens in Washington, California authorities say there is 
no turning back in the drive toward a new generation of cleaner cars. Federal 
backsliding, they said, will make the effort more difficult but not impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"We can do a lot without the Feds, but it's going to impact our ability to get 
ahead," said James M. Lents, executive officer of the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District. 
</P>
<P>
The struggle over cleaner cars comes at a time when major oil companies -- 
recognizing that alternative fuels such as methanol could eventually push 
gasoline out of much of the market -- are developing reformulated gasolines 
that burn cleaner than conventional gasoline. Arco's EC-1 is but the first in a 
line of cleaner gasolines expected to be developed by oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
Although reformulated gasoline will likely provide immediate clean air 
benefits, it is also a reason why auto makers are urging a go-slow approach in 
mass-producing cars that run on alternative fuels like methanol. They are 
especially concerned about consumer acceptance of a new line of vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't fun taking a chance in the auto industry, because if you make a 
mistake you lose big. Just ask Ford when they produced the Edsel. It was a good 
car but nobody would buy it," said Tim MacCarthy, federal liaison director of 
the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, at least one major public policy research group, the World 
Resources Institute, is warning that methanol is not the way to go. 
</P>
<P>
The institute said methanol would fail to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign 
energy resources (because they said it would be made with cheap natural gas 
from OPEC countries) and would make a minimal contribution to clean air. It 
also said the drive toward methanol would divert scarce research and 
development dollars from more promising cleaner alternatives, such as 
hydrogen-powered vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
California officials say they can't wait. Action is required now. They said 
methanol is the next logical step beyond reformulated gasoline, while not 
ruling out any fuel that can meet or beat it. 
</P>
<P>
They point to differences in emission characteristics between methanol and 
Arco's EC-1. 
</P>
<P>
Although EC-1 would reduce smog-causing volatile organic compounds by 20%, a 
blended methanol fuel would cut those same emissions by 30%, compared to 
typical future gasoline cars. If the fuel was 100% methanol instead of blending 
it with 15% gasoline, the vehicles would emit 80% less VOC than future gasoline 
vehicles, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
No one denies the immediate air quality benefits of reformulated gasoline. Its 
strong point is that it could be used in every gasoline car on the road today. 
</P>
<P>
Although those gasoline cars are individually dirtier than, say, a car running 
on a methanol blend, there are more of them. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, said Lents, the overall air quality improvement from cleaning up great 
numbers of gasoline cars compared to a limited number of cleaner methanol cars 
would be about the same. 
</P>
<P>
"We could virtually achieve an equivalent overall reduction," Lents said. 
</P>
<P>
But Lents said reformulated gasoline should not become an excuse for going no 
further. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want people to have outs. The system always has outs," Lents 
complained. "We've got to keep the pressure on." 
</P>
<P>
Although policy makers are careful not to exclude any fuel from consideration 
in the future, methanol is the near-term fuel of choice. 
</P>
<P>
It has a track record. About 1,000 cars running on pure methanol and 40 cars 
that can run on a blend of methanol and gasoline are operating in California. 
Another 1,000 are expected to be on the road by the year's end. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Rapid Transit District has placed 31 methanol buses in 
service to test their performance and durability. Indianapolis 500 race cars 
have long run on the fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, methanol as a liquid fuel can be phased into the existing 
transportation infrastructure that is geared to liquid fuels -- gasoline and 
diesel -- more easily than alternative fuels like natural gas or electric 
batteries. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, major foreign and domestic auto makers are working on 
so-called flexible fuel cars that can run on either gasoline or methanol or any 
blend of the two, thanks to advances in computer technology. 
</P>
<P>
Methanol poses problems as well. It is corrosive and some engine parts would 
have to be made of stainless steel. Methanol gets about half the mileage of 
gasoline. Methanol emits more formaldehyde -- a known cancer-causing agent. 
</P>
<P>
None of these and other problems, however, are insurmountable, state officials 
say. Although methanol offers poorer mileage, the per gallon cost of methanol 
would be less than premium gasoline. Moreover, the state maintains that 
formaldehyde emissions can be reduced by development of a catalytic converter. 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, political as well as technological problems. 
</P>
<P>
Congress appears to be putting on the brakes. A compromise ironed out last week 
between Senate negotiators and the White House all but foreclosed federal 
requirements on auto makers to produce cars that run on methanol or other 
alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), who authored legislation establishing the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District as a member of the state Assembly in 
1976, said that unless car makers are required to build alternative-fuel cars, 
"an important first battle" will have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
"It would delay the time in which we would make the next significant step in 
the direction of seeing our mountains. It will impact the speed with which we 
move toward cleaner air," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
But California officials appear undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
"If Congress doesn't do it we still have full authority in California," said 
California Energy Commission chairman Charles R. Imbrecht. 
</P>
<P>
Next September, the state Air Resources Board plans to vote on far-reaching 
tailpipe standards that will all but require a massive shift from gasoline 
cars, barring some breakthrough that would dramatically clean up the fuel 
beyond the current and contemplated reformulated versions. 
</P>
<P>
If the board follows through, one out of every four cars sold in the state 
beginning in 1997 would have to emit 70% less smog-forming hydrocarbons than 
will come from the tailpipes of new gasoline cars in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, board staff estimated, two-thirds of gasoline use in 
California would be displaced by the cleaner fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Auto makers would have to build the cars -- and oil companies would have to 
provide the fuel -- as a condition of doing business in the state. 
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt that California has the clout to impose such 
requirements. The federal government has given the state authority to exceed 
federal tailpipe standards, and California is a big market. One out of every 10 
new cars sold in the United States is registered in California. 
</P>
<P>
Other states like New York are following the state's example. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was an air quality administrator in California I would beat my breast in 
pride that other states are nationalizing the California program," said 
MacCarthy of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
That may be too sweeping a claim for California to make at this point, 
especially since Senate negotiators don't appear to be going nearly as far as 
California would like. 
</P>
<P>
How the clean fuels issue will ultimately resolve itself is as murky as the 
skies over Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
What is clear, however, is that political pressure continues to build for ever 
cleaner cars. The only question is how soon they will be on the road and what 
will be in their tanks.

ISRAEL COALITION NEAR COLLAPSE OVER PEACE BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Israel's coalition government, unable to take the fateful step toward the 
country's first peace talks with Palestinians, edged toward collapse Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Top Cabinet ministers from the Likud and Labor parties, the coalition partners, 
met for three hours but adjourned without a vote on a U.S. proposal to get the 
peace process under way. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the end of the agreement," fumed Labor leader Shimon Peres, who has 
summoned his 1,300-member Central Committee to discuss today the party's 
possible withdrawal from the 15-month-old national unity government. 
</P>
<P>
According to participants, Peres demanded that his Likud counterpart, Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, put a positive response to the American proposal to a 
vote of the 12 assembled ministers. Shamir refused, prompting Peres to lead his 
Labor followers out of the conference room in ministerial offices in West 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
"We served notice that a lack of a vote would be seen as a decision, and I see 
this as a negative decision," Peres told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Declared Communications Minister Gad Yaacobi, a Peres supporter: "The reason 
for this government to exist has ended. The present peace process was ended by 
Likud. There is no chance to continue." 
</P>
<P>
However, brinkmanship is an art in Israeli politics, and despite Peres' 
insistence that the coalition no longer serves a purpose, other politicians 
pushed for more time on the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We must make an effort -- another day or two, another week or two -- to find a 
formula that will enable the two parties to act together," urged Transport 
Minister Moshe Katsav, a member of Likud. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, more flexible than Peres on deadlines, 
reportedly put forward a compromise Sunday to bridge the gap between Peres and 
Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin called for immediate acceptance of the American formula -- which would 
jar loose the stalemated peace process -- and subsequent parliamentary 
decisions on the issues of negotiating strategy dividing the two parties. 
</P>
<P>
But Rabin's proposal never came to a vote. "The prime minister said there was 
still a need for more discussion," Katsav told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir and Rabin, who have demonstrated the ability to work the middle ground 
between Labor's doves and Likud's hawks, both left the Cabinet meeting without 
talking to reporters. Before the meeting, however, Rabin told Israel Radio, "A 
government that blocks the chance for peace will be sorry, and there is no 
place for its continued existence." 
</P>
<P>
Army Radio said legislators of both parties traveling abroad were summoned home 
as the political leaders girded for the fallout from Sunday's Cabinet meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts expect the governmental crisis to follow this pattern: 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Labor Party Central Committee will make a decision on whether to 
remain in the coalition or toss the responsibility to Labor members of 
Parliament for more flexibility. Perhaps Thursday, a vote of no-confidence in 
the coalition could be raised in Parliament, and Labor members might then join 
in bringing down the government. Attempts would be made by both Labor and Likud 
to form a thin majority with minor parties. In fact, discussions among Labor 
officials and some religious parties have been reported in the last three days. 
If the coalition crumbles and neither big party can salvage a majority with the 
support of small parties, a general election would be held. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's recent political history is etched with excruciatingly involved 
governmental crises, and voters are inured to the process. However, the 
questions of peace and negotiations strike emotional chords that have made this 
more than just another crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Radio reports said Likud ministers at Sunday's meeting complained loudly 
against what they perceived to be American pressure to open political talks 
with Palestinians. They raised unconfirmed reports that Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III plans to go to Cairo for the initial talks, condemning what 
they consider a high-profile approach to negotiations that they want to keep at 
the technical level. 
</P>
<P>
This effort to establish peace talks, one of many over past decades, had 
several foundations. The Palestinian intifada -- the uprising in the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip -- began in December, 1987, bringing 
daily violence to the Israeli doorstep. Nearly a year later, Yasser Arafat and 
his Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) for the first time recognized the 
existence of the state of Israel. He said Israelis have the right to live 
within secure borders and repeated his longstanding demand for a Palestinian 
state. Then, in May, 1989, Shamir put forward the elements of the peace plan 
now being debated. 
</P>
<P>
The Shamir plan would eventually lead to the election of Palestinian 
representatives to negotiate with Israelis on the future status of the occupied 
territories. The first step is the selection of a panel of Palestinians to meet 
in Cairo and discuss arrangements for the elections. The Baker compromise is 
designed to bridge differences between Palestinians and Israelis on who may be 
delegates to those Cairo talks. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir is opposed to any attempt by the PLO to control the Cairo delegation.

APPEAL TO CLERGY TO TEST VACCINE 'PREMATURE'; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: THE ARCHBISHOP'S LETTER ASKING NUNS AND PRIESTS TO VOLUNTEER FOR AN 
EXPERIMENTAL AIDS TREATMENT WAS SENT WITHOUT DR. JONAS SALK'S KNOWLEDGE.

<P>
A private appeal from the archbishop of Los Angeles for the archdiocese's 2,900 
nuns and priests to volunteer for tests of an experimental AIDS vaccine 
developed by Dr. Jonas Salk, the polio vaccine pioneer, was "premature" and 
made without Salk's knowledge, a key project researcher said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Alexandra Levine of USC Medical School in Los Angeles also said the appeal 
misstated the types of volunteers who will be sought for the project, which has 
yet to be approved by California health officials. Only nuns, who "are at 
essentially no risk of acquiring AIDS," will be sought, not priests, Levine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal for volunteers from the clergy was issued in early February in 
letters from Archbishop Roger M. Mahony and Dr. Brian E. Henderson, director of 
USC's Kenneth Norris Jr. Comprehensive Cancer Center. It is the latest twist in 
the ongoing trials of Salk's controversial approach to AIDS prevention and 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony wrote a cover letter informing priests and nuns that Henderson was 
seeking 10 volunteers to test the vaccine. Henderson's letter discussed the 
vaccine project and its risk and included a consent form. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Salk and I were unaware (until contacted by reporters) that these letters 
had gone out and believe they are premature," said Levine, who discussed the 
situation with Salk on Sunday. Salk is the founder of the Salk Institute for 
Biological Studies in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"A plan to send letters seeking volunteers from the clergy had been agreed 
upon," Levine said. "But we had no intention of sending the letters until after 
all of the necessary approvals for the study had been granted." 
</P>
<P>
Archdiocese spokesman Monsignor Stephen E. Blaire stressed at a news conference 
Sunday that no pressure has been applied on priests or nuns to volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony, interviewed in Rome by the Associated Press on Sunday, said that 
Henderson told him at their last meeting a few weeks ago that about six nuns 
and one or two priests had been in contact with him. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if priests and nuns had been contacted because they are unlikely to have 
been exposed to the AIDS virus -- most commonly transmitted through sexual 
intercourse or dirty hypodermic needles -- Mahony said, "No." 
</P>
<P>
"That's not the reason Dr. Henderson asked me nor why I sent the letter," 
Mahony said. "(You're) looking for people who would want to volunteer for 
something that could be very risky. . . . You're really looking for people who 
have a commitment to humankind and willingness to take risks to benefit 
others." 
</P>
<P>
Mahony said he had issued the appeal because "it's something the church is 
always interested in, finding some ways to counter serious illness, and 
certainly HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a serious illness in our times. 
It's just a basic Christian human response." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Levine said she could not explain why Henderson, head of the research project, 
had sent out his letter without informing Salk and Levine, who are working with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Salk's AIDS treatment is known as "HIV-immunogen." The immunogen is designed to 
boost the immune system and make it more resistant to the effects of the human 
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, the cause of AIDS. The treatments are prepared 
by stripping AIDS virus particles of the envelope proteins that surround them 
and rendering the particles non-infectious through the use of chemicals and 
radiation. The particles are then injected into muscle or skin. 
</P>
<P>
Some AIDS experts have voiced concern about the safety of the HIV immunogen. 
They cite the possibility that it might be contaminated by live AIDS virus, a 
possibility that Salk and Levine believe is highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
So far, HIV-immunogen has been tested at USC in about 100 HIV-infected 
individuals. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved national tests 
for an additional 1,000 individuals, Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the USC researchers sought permission from the state Department of 
Health Services to expand the tests to include 10 uninfected individuals who 
are also at very low risk of AIDS infection. State officials are still 
considering the request.

25 YEARS LATER -- A NEW BATTLE AT BERKELEY; 
</P>
<P>
ACTIVISM: PLANS TO ERECT A MEMORIAL TO THE FREE SPEECH MOVEMENT AT UC, THE 
FIRST GREAT STUDENT UPRISING IN THE 1960S, STIRS DEBATE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago, UC Berkeley was recovering from a divisive three-month 
battle over the right to engage in political activity on campus -- the famed 
Free Speech Movement. 
</P>
<P>
Today, battle lines are drawn again, this time over whether the movement -- the 
first great student uprising of the 1960s -- deserves a memorial. 
</P>
<P>
"The Free Speech Movement represented a rebirth of student activism in this 
nation and remains an inspiration to students around the world," said Peter 
Selz, a retired UC Berkeley art professor and one of the main backers of a 
memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Selz added: "Look at the students in Prague, Leipzig and Tian An Men Square; 
they are the direct descendants of the Free Speech Movement." 
</P>
<P>
But support for the memorial is far from unanimous. One of the memorial's 
leading foes, journalism professor David Littlejohn, said that to welcome it to 
campus "would be to reject and insult the opinions of many who did not regard 
(the movement) as Berkeley's finest hour." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of commemorating the Free Speech Movement evolved in 1988 through 
informal discussions among Selz, physics professor Charles Schwartz and 
architecture professor Galen Cranz. Some form of public art, they decided, 
would best honor the movement. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to commemorate more than just one point of time in history here," Selz 
said. "We want to commemorate the idea of free expression. We want it to serve 
as an inspiration for future generations of student activists." 
</P>
<P>
The three enlisted the support of many prominent faculty and student leaders, 
past and present, and formed the Berkeley Art Project. But rather than 
commission an artist, they decided to have a contest, allowing entries to be 
displayed and critiqued by the university community. 
</P>
<P>
The contest attracted 275 entries, which on Feb 6. were narrowed to five 
finalists by a panel formed by the art project. The panel is scheduled to 
announce its top choice later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial backers so far have raised $30,000 from private sources. Their goal is 
to raise $120,000 to pay for constructing the memorial and paying the artist, 
yet to be selected. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, however, several campus committees and outgoing Chancellor Ira 
Michael Heyman must approve the memorial concept and its final design. That is 
proving no sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
Heyman has expressed "personal misgivings" about the project. And to many 
members of the campus community, the Free Speech Movement is a bad memory and 
an embarrassment to the school. 
</P>
<P>
Littlejohn, who has taught at the university since 1963, said that by 
commemorating the movement, "The university would be coming down on a specific 
side of (what was) a passionate controversy. . . . There is no consensus on 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Selz conceded that the movement divided the campus. But he added: "Important 
events are divisive. Look at the two most divisive in American history -- the 
Civil War and the Vietnam War. In both cases, a work of art -- the Lincoln 
Memorial and the Vietnam Memorial -- helped heal that division." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the dispute has been limited mainly to the faculty and the opinion 
pages of the campus newspaper. Few students have taken an interest in the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in favor of the project, but it's mainly a faculty issue," said Cecilia 
Wang, a student government representative who sponsored a resolution backing 
the memorial. "We don't have the time or energy to get involved in this. 
Besides, this is something from the past and we're more concerned with issues 
that affect the future," such as ethnic diversity among the faculty. 
</P>
<P>
The Free Speech Movement began on Oct. 1, 1964, when student Mario Savio and 
ex-student Jack Weinberg set up a table on Sproul Plaza to recruit students 
into a civil rights group. The two, supported by a coalition of student groups 
ranging from socialists to Republicans, were intentionally challenging a 1959 
UC Berkeley ban on advocating or collecting funds for off-campus causes. 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg was quickly arrested by university police and placed in a patrol car. 
But hundreds of students surrounded the vehicle, blocking its passage and 
preventing police from taking him away. 
</P>
<P>
While Weinberg remained handcuffed in the back seat of the vehicle, Savio and 
other student leaders used the patrol car as a podium for anti-administration 
speeches, receiving national television coverage. The standoff ended 32 hours 
later. 
</P>
<P>
The following months were marked by protests, strikes and arrests, including 
one incident in which 773 students were dragged from an administration 
building. After a semester of rebellion, the administration gave in to the 
movement's main demands, allowing students to engage in activities promoting 
off-campus political causes on university property. 
</P>
<P>
The movement's tactics, which included sit-ins, teach-ins, satiric songs, skits 
and other acts of civil disobedience, became the model used by protesters 
against the Vietnam War, apartheid and other causes ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Like the movement they seek to honor, the memorial contest's 275 entries ranged 
from the irreverent and bizarre to the abstract. They included a full-size 
ceramic police car, a giant screw, three monkeys in a cage, a toppled 
Roman-style column with a broken bust of Cicero at its feet, and four pedestals 
topped with busts of Abbie Hoffman sticking out his tongue. 
</P>
<P>
The five semifinalists are as diverse as the group from which they were chosen. 
</P>
<P>
One proposal would create a column of air 6 inches in diameter marked by a 
round marble "frame." The air and the ground underneath it would be declared 
"not a part of any nation and not subject to any entity's jurisdiction." 
</P>
<P>
Two other semifinalists would have practical uses. One calls for a yellow block 
labeled "soapbox" to be placed at the foot of the steps leading up to Sproul 
Hall, which fronts the plaza. Another would mount a giant electronic billboard 
over the student union building facing the plaza. Students and others would be 
able to type their ideas onto a computer terminal that would then flash the 
messages to thousands of passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
The other two finalists propose that messages celebrating free speech be inlaid 
into the pavement of Sproul Plaza. One would consist of letters made of 
variegated red brick set directly into the pavement, while the other would have 
letters set into large, metal-filled cracks that would emanate from the plaza's 
central fountain. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the final pick's artistic merit, Heyman may reject it. In a 
recent letter to the faculty, he wrote, "For many, perhaps most, 1964 was a 
time of universally shared agony." 
</P>
<P>
Heyman's attitude surprised many because in the immediate aftermath of the Free 
Speech Movement he headed a faculty committee that produced a report 
sympathetic to the students' goals. 
</P>
<P>
But Heyman has said he now regrets much of what followed the rebellion. In his 
view, it opened an era of radical dominance at Berkeley that has squelched 
other political opinions. 
</P>
<P>
Savio, now a physics teacher in Modesto, and other leaders of the Free Speech 
Movement -- Michael Rossman, an author and teacher living in Berkeley; Jackie 
Goldberg, now president of the Los Angeles school board, and her brother, Art 
Goldberg, a Los Angeles attorney -- strongly support the memorial and have 
contributed to it. But they are unlikely to lead any protests over it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll send a check, but the younger generation is going to have to lead the 
march this time," said Art Goldberg.

BONN SEES UNITY TALKS LIMITED TO 4 WAR ALLIES; 
</P>
<P>
REUNIFICATION: POLAND AND OTHER EUROPEAN NATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BALK AT THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT.

<P>
A senior West German official declared Sunday that only the four principal 
victorious World War II Allies could participate with Bonn and East Berlin in 
talks concerning German reunification. 
</P>
<P>
The statement by Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble was certain to displease 
some other European nations, particularly Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble, who is also a senior adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, said in a 
radio broadcast that the so-called two-plus-four nations would have sole 
authority to work out the details of German unity. 
</P>
<P>
"We must, of course, inform and consult everyone -- all our NATO partners and 
European neighbors," Schaeuble declared. "But the decisive questions will be 
discussed between the Germans -- the two states in Germany -- and the four 
powers. That does not suit everyone else in Europe, as we know." 
</P>
<P>
Poland has demanded that it be included in any conference dealing with 
questions raised by German unification because it was one of Nazi Germany's 
major wartime victims. 
</P>
<P>
The new Warsaw government has also been alarmed by Kohl's waffling on the 
question of permanent recognition of Poland's western border with Germany, 
which embraces territories that were part of Germany before it lost the war. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of foreign ministers in Ottawa last month, the two-plus-four 
formula was enunciated. Under it, the two Germanys would begin preliminary 
talks on unification, working on the internal details. The talks would then be 
enlarged to include the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union to 
hammer out the international aspects. 
</P>
<P>
The initial working meeting between East and West German officials on the 
subject was held Friday in East Berlin, and the first expanded, six-nation 
talks will take place Wednesday in Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, President Francois Mitterrand of France backed Poland's demand that 
Warsaw be included in talks concerning German unity. But Schaeuble rejected the 
Polish demand. He argued that since no peace treaty was signed with Germany 
after the war, there is legal justification for the four victorious Allies to 
take part in the talks but not for others to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"The Italians, the Canadians, the Dutch, the Danes, also the Poles -- they all 
have a legitimate interest that the process of completing German unity should 
take account of their interests," Schaeuble said. But he did not offer them a 
seat at the conference table. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Schaeuble, presumably speaking on behalf of Kohl, declared that the 
35-member Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe is not the proper 
venue for putting an international seal of approval on German unity. 
</P>
<P>
An expected late-fall summit meeting of the nations of the security conference 
-- all of Europe except Albania, plus the United States and Canada -- has been 
suggested by some diplomats as the ideal forum for approving German 
unification. But Kohl is known to oppose such a large gathering for that 
purpose, believing that it would be unwieldy and could drag on endlessly. 
</P>
<P>
The Polish border issue was kept alive Sunday when Herbert Hupka, leader of the 
Silesian Expellees, argued that Poland had no legal basis for maintaining the 
sanctity of its western borders. Nor, he said, did the Soviet Union have any 
legal right to territory taken from German East Prussia after the war. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no historical, ethical or legally established claim for Poland or the 
Soviet Union on East Germany beyond the Oder and Neisse," Hupka said in a 
speech in Minden, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The line along the Oder and Neisse rivers was set as East Germany's border with 
Poland by the Potsdam Conference in 1945. The conference ceded large portions 
of German Pomerania, Silesia and East Prussia to Poland; parts of East Prussia 
and large sectors of what was eastern Poland before the war went to the Soviet 
Union.

HISTORY WILL JUDGE, QUAYLE SAYS OF PINOCHET;

DIPLOMACY: THE DEPARTING STRONGMAN EQUATES HIS BLOODY 1973 COUP WITH DEMOCRATIC 
REVOLTS IN EASTERN EUROPE.

SANTIAGO, Chile 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle, bidding farewell to the last dictator on the South 
American Continent, said Sunday after meeting with Gen. Augusto Pinochet that 
after 16 years of strongman rule, the Chilean leader's place in history will be 
judged by his decision to turn the government over to a democratically elected 
president. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Pinochet equated the bloody coup in 1973, in which the armed 
forces and police overthrew the Marxist-led government of President Salvador 
Allende, with the democratic revolutions that have rocked Eastern Europe. 
Pinochet told Quayle: 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't understood. What is happening with the Berlin Wall, East Berlin, 
Europe -- that happened to us here 16 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle's day in Santiago, the capital, and in Valparaiso, now the seat of 
Congress where Patricio Aylwin was inaugurated as president, presented a sharp 
contrast with his political life at home. 
</P>
<P>
A conservative crowd of several hundred Pinochet supporters jeered him -- as a 
representative of a U.S. government that has been pressing for a return to 
democracy in Chile -- when he arrived at Pinochet's residence. The 
well-appointed crowd -- some members wore jewelry, and Sony Walkman headphones 
were in evidence -- shouted obscenities at him. 
</P>
<P>
At home, Quayle generally is applauded by conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
As he drove to Aylwin's inauguration -- his main reason for visiting Chile -- 
Quayle stopped to shake hands at a street corner in a working-class 
neighborhood where the new president's supporters flocked around the visiting 
U.S. politician and applauded. 
</P>
<P>
The visit to Chile has posed something of a dilemma for the Bush 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is a celebration of democracy and harmony -- Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.), one of the most outspoken congressional critics of the Pinochet 
regime, accompanied Quayle -- it has also called attention to the coup that 
brought Pinochet to power and to reports at the time of U.S. support for the 
coup. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, who told reporters as he flew to Santiago that "there is nothing the 
United States should apologize for" in its past relations with Chile, said 
after his 35-minute session with Pinochet in his home that he told the general 
that "his role in history is just beginning to be recorded."

COMMUNISTS AND BUDDHISTS STAGE RALLIES IN MONGOLIA

<P>
Thousands of Communist Party supporters staged a pro-government rally in the 
Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator on Sunday, while Buddhists held a separate 
demonstration demanding resumption of religious activity at an old temple. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of violence. 
</P>
<P>
However, the competing protests marked a new level of tension as opposition 
forces press demands for rapid political change and the government's response 
remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
In a concession to the opposition, Mongolian President Jambyn Batmonh promised 
last week that all members of the policy-setting Politburo, which he heads, 
will submit their resignations at a meeting today of the ruling Communist 
Party's Central Committee. It was not clear, however, whether the resignations 
will be accepted or whether many of the same leaders might be immediately 
reelected. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's pro-government demonstration, which, according to reports from the 
Mongolian capital, drew about 5,000 people, appeared aimed at reinforcing the 
political position of Batmonh and other leaders of the Mongolian People's 
Revolutionary Party, as the Communists are officially known, before today's 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition-backed pro-Buddhist demonstration, joined by about 2,000 people, 
reflected a recent upsurge in respect for all aspects of Mongolia's ancient 
traditions. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters, according to a European diplomat reached by telephone from 
Beijing, were demanding that a former Buddhist temple in Ulan Bator now used as 
a museum be restored to its religious function.

LATINO POLITICIANS TO PRESSURE COUNTY TO SETTLE REMAP LAWSUIT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles' Latino political leadership will pressure county supervisors at 
their Tuesday meeting to settle the multimillion-dollar redistricting lawsuit 
against the county immediately and pave the way for a Latino to succeed 
Supervisor Pete Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
The decision came Sunday night at the end of a 2 1/2-hour meeting called by the 
Latino community's senior elected officials to set strategy in the wake of 
Schabarum's decision not to seek reelection to the First District seat he has 
held for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the group of 26 officials and political activists held off 
endorsing any particular candidate until potential challengers better assess 
their chances. 
</P>
<P>
But the group, led by Congressman Esteban Torres (D-Pico Rivera) and Los 
Angeles City Council members Gloria Molina and Richard Alatorre, will ask the 
board Tuesday to rearrange Schabarum's predominantly Anglo district to include 
more Latino neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The move reflects worry among Latinos that Schabarum's last-minute move may 
have threatened the ability of prominent Latinos to seek the seat. Of those who 
are considering a run, Alatorre and Molina -- who both live outside the 
district -- could not file for office unless the lines were redrawn. Torres may 
not be able to run because he has filed for reelection to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Latino voting strength is at the heart of the redistricting suit now being 
heard in federal court in Los Angeles. The U.S. Justice Department, the 
American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund allege that the supervisors had broken up Latino communities 
among three districts to keep Latinos off the influential board.

PRO-CHOICE REPUBLICAN IS LOOKING LESS LIBERAL; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: TRICIA HUNTER WAS CATAPULTED INTO NATIONAL HEADLINES AND THE ASSEMBLY 
ON THE ABORTION ISSUE. BUT SHE HAS DISTANCED HERSELF FROM PRO-CHOICE AND 
GUN-CONTROL ACTIVISTS.

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stepping up to the microphone during a recent legislative debate, rookie 
Assemblywoman Tricia Hunter (R-Bonita) disclosed that she keeps a gun on her 
nightstand when her husband, a Navy commander, is away from home. 
</P>
<P>
The admission -- along with her vote that day against a gun-control measure and 
the distance she has put between herself and the pro-choice movement -- has 
left some people wondering whether Hunter is now backing off of the selective 
liberal views that helped catapult her into national headlines and victory last 
year in a hotly contested Assembly race. 
</P>
<P>
By a fluke of timing, the registered nurse-turned-politician found herself 
running as the only pro-choice Republican in a legislative election that was 
the first in the country after the U.S. Supreme Court's Webster decision in 
July, a ruling that gave state legislatures more say on the politically 
explosive abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
That legal opinion elevated what should have been a long-shot candidacy into a 
political litmus test on abortion. And it galvanized pro-choice advocates, 
whose support helped Hunter squeeze out a victory last October in a 
conservative district that encompasses parts of San Diego and Riverside 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's endorsement of an assault weapon ban enacted earlier by the 
Legislature also drew kudos from the gun-control lobby and won her its backing. 
</P>
<P>
But just five months later, Hunter, 37, is downplaying the significance of her 
pro-choice position and attempting to precisely explain her views on gun 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Discussing her pro-choice position, she said recently: "It's not my only issue. 
I don't want to go to rallies and I don't intend to be a flag-carrying 
(advocate)." 
</P>
<P>
To prove the point, she turned down an invitation to appear with a long line of 
other lawmakers at a pro-choice rally outside the Capitol in January to mark 
the anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing 
abortion. Her absence was made all the more noticeable when her victory in the 
special election was invoked by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) 
as an example of the political muscle flexed by pro-choice forces. 
</P>
<P>
She has also voted against the pro-choice lobby. During the November special 
session on earthquake relief, she joined Assembly Republicans to block a 
resolution that called on Gov. George Deukmejian to restore family planning 
funds. She voted against the measure, she said at the time, because it was a 
surprise and was out of place in the special session. 
</P>
<P>
In a milder test, Hunter recently abstained from voting on anti-abortion 
amendments that were proposed for a bill regarding genetic testing. The 
amendments failed. 
</P>
<P>
"She abstained against us on that bill, which was disappointing," said Norma K. 
Clevenger, lobbyist for Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California. "But I 
think probably because the amendments came up quickly, nobody had the time to 
talk to her." 
</P>
<P>
Clevenger and other pro-life supporters say they believe that Hunter will be a 
vote they can count on during the big fights. Some of the mixed signals, they 
say, may be attributable to her worries about being reelected. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she sees herself as being somewhat vulnerable," Clevenger said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, her recent vote against a 15-day waiting period for hunting rifles 
and long gun sales -- a measure that narrowly passed the Legislature -- has 
some people grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
"When she came out against assault weapons (during her campaign), we supported 
her and here we thought that we had someone very much on our side," said Stan 
Foster, a San Diego businessman and national vice chairman of Handgun Control 
Inc. He characterized Hunter's vote against the waiting period bill as a 
"terrible disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
In response, Hunter said gun-control supporters apparently weren't listening 
very closely during her campaign. She said she has always been against the 
waiting period proviso. 
</P>
<P>
Some San Diego County politicos explain Hunter's recent actions as an effort to 
curry favor with her conservative constituents in time for the June 5 primary, 
in which she faces an anti-abortion challenger. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what you're going to see from Tricia Hunter is that she is going to 
vote whatever is expedient," said Poway management consultant Dick Lyles, who 
lost to Hunter last year. "It's real clear what she's trying to do is appear to 
be a mainstream Republican." 
</P>
<P>
But the feisty political newcomer says her votes and tactics in Sacramento 
should come as no surprise. Hunter maintains that she has always been more 
conservative than portrayed by the media or campaign rhetoric, which latched 
onto the abortion and gun-control issues. 
</P>
<P>
So far, she said, most of her time in office has been used to feel her way 
through the often mysterious legislative process and to show her colleagues -- 
especially her fellow Republicans in the Assembly -- that she wants to be a 
team player and holds no grudges for their opposition to her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have gone to Sacramento with a chip on my shoulder," she said. "I had 
a right to be indignant, angry at the way I was treated (by Republicans) in the 
election. But what purpose does it serve? It doesn't do me any good."

Hunter's primary opponent is Connie Youngkin, a homemaker who is a leader in 
Operation Rescue's anti-abortion movement in San Diego. Youngkin's hopes are 
partially pegged to the rules of the primary, which prevent the kind of 
crossover votes from pro-choice Democrats that Hunter needed to eke out a 
victory in last year's special election.

SIMMONS GROUP EXPLAINS CHALLENGE TO LOCKHEED BOARD

A group seeking to take control of Lockheed Corp. by replacing the directors 
with its own nominees charged Sunday that the aerospace firm's 1989 
reorganization had been a "failure" and that its business strategy is 
"dangerously ambivalent." 
</P>
<P>
A proxy statement, designed to solicit the votes of Lockheed shareholders, was 
released by NL Industries, a Houston chemical company controlled by financier 
Harold C. Simmons. NL Industries, which supports the rival slate selected and 
led by Simmons, used the statement to explain its challenge to the Lockheed 
board and to present its own proposals for managing the company. 
</P>
<P>
NL Industries also said it has no current plans to sell or liquidate important 
Lockheed assets and denied speculation that it plans to drain off "any 
over-funding" from Lockheed's pension plans. Some Wall Street analysts have 
speculated that NL might want to return any excess to shareholders in the form 
of a special dividend. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons' company owns 18.9% of Lockheed's stock. The proxy fight will be 
decided March 29 at Lockheed's annual meeting when shareholders vote on the 
competing slates of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Calling for the replacement of the present board, NL Industries' statement said 
the Lockheed restructuring plan -- put into effect last April -- had failed to 
make the aerospace firm more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
The statement referred to a slide in the value of the company's stock and said 
it was associated with an earnings decline at Lockheed. The stock price, which 
reached a 12-month high of $54.75 in the third quarter of 1989, closed at 
$35.625 Friday. The company posted earnings of $2 million on sales of $9.9 
billion in 1989, compared to a profit of $624 million on sales of $10.4 billion 
the year before. 
</P>
<P>
Major causes of the earnings decline were losses in 1989 of more than $400 
million on the P-7A Navy patrol aircraft program and on Lockheed's production 
of the wings for the C-17 military transport plane for which McDonnell Douglas 
is the prime contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed has attributed both losses to "industrywide" woes relating to 
fixed-price development contracts with the government -- pacts that do not 
allow contractors to recoup losses from cost overruns. The P-7A and C-17 are 
both fixed-price projects. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed officials had no immediate comment Sunday on the proxy statement, but 
they had earlier cited their April, 1989, restructuring program as a strategy 
for improving earnings. Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep said in a recent 
letter to shareholders that the cornerstone of the restructuring is increasing 
the efficiency of the company's core defense and aeronautics business. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Tellep has said, he expects to cope with cuts in defense 
spending by generating more revenue in commercial operations, thereby reducing 
the company's reliance on defense-related spending. Lockheed now obtains 75% of 
its revenues from Defense Department contracts. 
</P>
<P>
However, NL Industries President J. Landis Martin said Sunday that the 
diversification effort diverts the attention of Lockheed executives from their 
"core" businesses of contracting for the Department of Defense and the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think they're imposing enough control over the core -- particularly 
on the aeronautical division," Martin said in a telephone interview after the 
proxy statement was released. 
</P>
<P>
The proxy statement also weighed in on Lockheed's diversification plan, calling 
it "dangerously ambivalent." 
</P>
<P>
NL Industries "believes that now, more than ever, Lockheed must focus on 
improving quality, lowering costs and enhancing confidence in its core space, 
missiles and aeronautical businesses," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, in the interview, was particularly critical of Lockheed's operations in 
computer graphics and commercial airplane modification and repair, calling them 
financial "under-performers." 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many companies in that (computer graphics) business, and many 
companies have been there for a long time," he said. "It's too competitive 
already." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said that if NL's slate wins control of Lockheed on March 29, it will 
first try to improve Lockheed's operations outside the defense and aeronautics 
fields. He added, however, that if a turnaround could not be achieved, the 
operations could be sold.

Two mild aftershocks to the Upland earthquake shook parts of Los Angeles and 
San Bernardino counties early today, but no injuries or damage were reported, 
seismologists said. 
</P>
<P>
The first aftershock at 3:26 a.m. measured 3.3 on the Richter scale, and the 
second, at 3:29 a.m., measured 2.8, said Robert Finn of the California 
Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Both were centered four miles northwest of 
Upland.

Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega promised Vice President Dan Quayle today he 
will peacefully relinquish power April 25, without conditions, said U.S. 
officials traveling with Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega also assured the vice president that all Cabinet ministers, including 
the defense minister, "will be appointed by and report to Violeta Chamorro," 
the U.S.-backed candidate who beat Ortega in the Feb. 25 election, one official 
quoted Quayle as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The two met over a 1 1/2-hour lunch given by newly inaugurated Chilean 
President Patricio Aylwin in the presidential palace after arranging in two 
brief earlier chats to talk further. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega also asked that the Bush Administration immediately lift the economic 
sanctions imposed by the United States during his Sandinista regime, said the 
officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle assured him the Administration is already actively considering the same 
request made by Chamorro, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They said that while Ortega has said repeatedly that the Contras must be 
disbanded before power is transferred, he did not make that a condition to his 
promise today of peaceful transition. 
</P>
<P>
"He assured me he will turn over power as scheduled April 25," the day of 
Chamorro's inauguration, officials quoted Quayle as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega also told Quayle that the Nicaraguan power transfer "will be even more 
peaceful" than what occurred this weekend in Chile, which ended a 16-year 
military dictatorship, vice presidential aides said. 
</P>
<P>
They said Quayle brought up possible use of U.N. peacekeeping troops to help 
prevent outbreaks of fighting between the Contra rebels and Sandinista 
loyalists. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega indicated that that would be fine "if they are willing to take the 
risk," the aides said. They quoted Quayle as replying, "We better take a risk 
for peace."

The Food and Drug Administration approved today nationwide testing of a 
post-exposure AIDS vaccine developed by Dr. Jonas Salk, who pioneered the polio 
vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
Salk's vaccine will first be given to about 60 people who are infected with the 
AIDS-causing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but who have not developed any 
symptoms of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, FDA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The new vaccine, manufactured by Immune Products Ltd. of San Diego, has already 
been tested in chimpanzees and about 100 AIDS-infected people in California, 
which has its own AIDS drug-testing program.

COMMUTER TRAIN SERVICE IS OKD

<P>
Southern California's first commuter train service was approved today, giving 
Orange County residents who work in Los Angeles an alternative to driving the 
perpetually clogged northbound freeways. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed commuter-friendly service, similar to those found on the East 
Coast, could begin as early as April 2 under the agreement unanimously approved 
by the Orange County Transportation Commission, which met in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for a morning rush-hour train to leave San Juan Capistrano at 6 
a.m., delivering commuters to Los Angeles' Union Station by 7:25 a.m. after 
stopping for passengers in Santa Ana, Anaheim and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket prices would be 20% cheaper than current Amtrak fares. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak now provides two trains from Orange County to Los Angeles, but the 
earliest morning train arrives at 8 a.m., a time considered too late for many 
workers who must take buses or cabs from the downtown Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
Before the service can become operable, the proposal must be approved by Santa 
Fe Railway, which owns the tracks.

GORBACHEV CALLS LITHUANIA'S BREAK ALARMING; NO HINT OF COUNTERMOVE

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today called Lithuania's declaration of 
independence "alarming" but gave no indication he plans any action to prevent 
the Baltic republic from breaking away. 
</P>
<P>
He did not, however, acknowledge the legality of the move, continuing to refer 
to Lithuania as a Soviet republic and not by the new name adopted by 
Lithuania's legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Another member of the ruling Communist Party Politburo told reporters that the 
Kremlin will deal peacefully with Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not use force," Yegor K. Ligachev told reporters at the Congress of 
People's Deputies in Moscow. "We must resolve this by political means." 
Ligachev is believed to be one of the more conservative members of the party's 
ruling body. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, opening a new session of the Congress, noted that the chairman of 
the Lithuanian delegation was absent from his chair on the stage with other 
members of the Presidium. 
</P>
<P>
"The information coming from Lithuania is alarming, and momentous decisions are 
being made there that will affect both Lithuania and the Soviet Union," 
Gorbachev told more than 2,000 deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers had assembled in Moscow today to consider constitutional 
amendments that would create a new, extraordinarily powerful Soviet president 
and revoke the Communist Party's monopoly on power. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said the Congress should study the "decisions adopted in the 
Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic," ignoring the republic legislature's 
action Sunday declaring a sovereign "Republic of Lithuania." 
</P>
<P>
Just two weeks after pro-independence candidates won a two-thirds majority in 
Lithuania's legislature, the body met in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, and 
voted to restore sovereignty after 50 years of Soviet rule. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian lawmakers acknowledge, though, that true independence can only be 
won after long, difficult negotiations with the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Bush Administration expressed support for Lithuania's move 
toward independence but said it will delay formal recognition until the 
Lithuanians are "in control of their own destiny." 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the United States will urge 
the Kremlin to "respect the will of the citizens of Lithuania." The United 
States has never recognized the forcible 1940 annexation of the three Soviet 
republics -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania's declaration of independence represents perhaps the biggest crisis 
yet for Gorbachev, who marked his fifth anniversary as Soviet leader on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a divided Soviet Congress debated Gorbachev's proposal for a 
powerful presidency, and the plan faced possible rejection for lack of the 
required two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
But Sergei Stankevich, a progressive deputy who has fought placing so much 
power in the hands of one man, said he would have to cave in if Gorbachev were 
to stake his own leadership on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The session fell behind schedule and closed for the day without a vote on the 
presidency, despite Gorbachev's urgings to keep to a tight schedule.

</P>
<P>
Pilot Michael Townsend thought the unidentified man had committed suicide, 
Martinez said.

Passengers said the plane, Flight 608, swerved to the right. They then heard a

Hundreds of striking teachers ignored Gov. Gaston Caperton's request to return 
to the classroom today and called for direct talks with the governor. 
</P>
<P>
The strike over pay began last Wednesday and by today had spread to 46 of the 
state's 55 counties. 
</P>
<P>
Classes were canceled in at least 27 counties for more than 150,000 pupils, 
about half the state's enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
A proposed settlement of the state's first teacher walkout collapsed over the 
weekend. The largest teachers union says West Virginia has the second-lowest 
teachers' salaries in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the 16,000-member West Virginia Education Assn. recommended 
continuing the strike until Caperton promises to call a special legislative 
session to consider pay raises. But the governor said he won't consider calling 
a special session until the teachers go back to work. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Atty. Gen. Roger Tompkins declared the strike illegal and said any 
teachers who walk off the job can be suspended, fired, barred from teaching for 
a year and charged with misdemeanors.

Volkswagen AG of West Germany, Europe's leading mass car maker, unveiled the 
biggest joint venture to date with East Germany today, a $3-billion pact to 
build Volkswagens at sites where East Germany's Trabant autos are now produced. 
</P>
<P>
One result of the deal will be to consign the boxy little Trabant sedan, which 
became a symbol for East Germany's political upheaval last year, to history by 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of the sputtering, two-stroke-engined cars brought refugees into West 
Germany in 1989. Once the borders opened in November, they carried in hordes of 
Eastern visitors eager to sample Western lifestyle for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen AG Chairman Carl Hahn told reporters at the Leipzig Trade Fair today 
that a joint venture firm in East Germany will start assembling 50 VW Polo 
models a day from September with output set to reach 250,000 cars a year by 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
"We see this as a European car project, with Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia 
just around the corner," Hahn said, giving an indication of the potential 
target markets for the new car. 
</P>
<P>
VW signed a commitment to the joint venture in December soon after revolution 
in Eastern Europe began breaking down the region's rigid barriers to the West. 
</P>
<P>
The project, with a factory at Karl-Marx-Stadt, is by far the most ambitious 
yet announced by any Western firm in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Opel AG, the West German subsidiary of General Motors Corp., announced a 
venture Sunday which aims to make 150,000 cars a year in East Germany.

TOKYO TRAINS KEEP COMMUTERS ON THEIR TOES

A Tokyo train line introduced seatless cars today to reduce overcrowding during 
rush hours and got a mixed response from commuters, some of whom complained of 
being treated like packages. 
</P>
<P>
The new cars on the crowded Yamanote loop line have foldable seats that can be 
lowered or folded back into the wall automatically by pushing a button, a 
railroad official said. 
</P>
<P>
The seats will remain folded during morning rush hour to increase the capacity 
of the cars and allow easier movement of passengers on and off trains, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Regular train cars on the line have a rated capacity of 144, while the new cars 
can officially carry 162 people. The cars actually carry many more passengers 
during rush hour, when they frequently are packed so tightly that people can 
hardly move. 
</P>
<P>
Only two trains with two seatless cars each were introduced today as an 
experiment, said an official who requested anonymity. "We will see how it goes 
and will decide whether we will continue the experiment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction of passengers was divided. A middle-age commuter told Kyodo News 
Service that he liked the new car because it was less crowded and that few 
people are able to sit anyway in cars that have seats. Other passengers said 
they felt they were being treated like packages and were riding in a freight 
train. 
</P>
<P>
The train official dismissed the criticism. "We decided to introduce the 
seatless cars to give better service and have never thought of treating our 
customers as packages," he said.

JUDGE RULES ON MONROE ESTATE

A judge has ruled that one-fourth of the earnings of Marilyn Monroe's 
multimillion-dollar estate belongs to a British psychiatric center for 
children, court papers revealed today. 
</P>
<P>
The money, which was tied up in a court battle launched by the widow of 
Monroe's acting coach, will go to the Anna Freud Centre for the Psychoanalytic 
Study and Treatment of Children in England, according to the ruling by Judge 
Marie Lambert in Manhattan Surrogate's Court. 
</P>
<P>
The estate of Marilyn Monroe, the blonde sex symbol who died in 1962 from an 
overdose of drugs and alcohol, grosses more than $1 million a year in royalties 
and other proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
In her simple three-page will, Monroe gave 75% of the proceeds to her acting 
coach, Lee Strasberg. His widow, Anna Strasberg, was subsequently named 
administrator of Monroe's estate after her husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe willed the remaining 25% to her psychiatrist, Dr. Marilyn Kris, to be 
used "for the furtherance of the work of such psychiatric institution or group 
as she shall elect." 
</P>
<P>
Kris died in 1980 and in her own will left her share of Monroe estate proceeds 
to the Hampstead Child-Therapy Clinic, precursor of the Freud Centre.

IS THE SUN GOING DOWN ON 'TODAY' WITHOUT JANE PAULEY?

<P>
These are tough times for NBC's venerable "Today" show, the program that 
invented the morning TV format. 
</P>
<P>
Last week it lost in the ratings to ABC's "Good Morning America" for the ninth 
consecutive week and it lost the February "sweeps" to ABC for the first time 
since November, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Is the sun going down on "Today"? 
</P>
<P>
"Today" ratings began declining with co-host Jane Pauley's poised and public 
departure from the show after 13 years. Her replacement, CBS newswoman Deborah 
Norville, apparently reminds some women of their least favorite college 
roommate. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'Today' show has experienced a serious decline, about 15% on average, 
since Deborah Norville took over," said David Marans, head of media research 
for the J. Walter Thompson advertising conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a clear reaction to the change in casting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' morning efforts generally have run a distant third in ratings almost since 
the network began competing with "Today" in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
In February, "CBS This Morning," dumped co-anchor Kathleen Sullivan in favor of 
ex-ABC newswoman Paula Zahn. The change has posted a barely discernible 
improvement in ratings. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, keeping the same cast before its cameras, won the No. 1 spot without 
significantly increasing its ratings. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a long time to develop a team," said Jack Riley, executive producer 
of "Good Morning America." "It takes an even longer time for the audience to 
accept it." 
</P>
<P>
NBC officials insist that they're not worried about the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew there was going to be a drop in the ratings for the 'Today' show," 
said NBC research chief Bob Niles. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that we were pretty good about forecasting it. The bad news 
is we didn't want to see those numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Niles said a similar ratings dip occurred after Bryant Gumbel replaced Tom 
Brokaw as co-host in January, 1982. For the next two years, ABC beat "Today" 
like a gong. One week in August, 1983, "Today" finished third for the first 
time.

MENENDEZ KILLINGS SLATED FOR TV FILM

<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood's version of the gruesome slayings of entertainment executive Jose 
Menendez and his wife may soon be seen in America's living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
New World Television said it is developing a television movie based on the case 
for CBS-TV. 
</P>
<P>
The movie will concentrate on the investigation of the couple's sons, Lyle, 22, 
and Erik, 19, and their arrests in last August's shotgun slayings in the 
Menendez mansion in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
New World President Jon Feltheimer said Friday that his firm was negotiating 
various rights regarding the story. He wouldn't elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Lamb was the producer of the television movie and Zev Braun was executive 
producer, New World Television said. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle and Erik Menendez were arrested and booked for investigation of murder. 
Lyle was arrested Thursday and Erik was arrested Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal complaints filed last week in Beverly Hills Municipal Court charged 
each brother on two counts of homicide in the Aug. 20 slayings of their 
parents, Jose Menendez, 45, and Mary Louise (Kitty) Menendez, 44. 
</P>
<P>
The young men are heirs to the $14-million estate of Jose Menendez, who was a 
successful executive of Live Entertainment Inc., a Los Angeles-based video 
distribution company.

COSBY, BARR, STREEP ACCEPT MULTIPLE AWARDS

<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Cosby was a triple winner at Sunday night's 16th annual People's Choice 
Awards, and comedian Roseanne Barr and actress Meryl Streep walked off with two 
awards each. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cosby Show" was named favorite television comedy series for the sixth 
time, and Cosby, a perennial winner, was named favorite male TV performer and 
all-around male entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
Barr, Cosby's chief rival for the top of the weekly TV ratings, was named 
favorite female TV performer and favorite all-around female entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
Backstage, Barr took the opportunity to deny reports that she wants out of the 
ABC series. "That was a joke," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Streep was the only other double winner, named favorite U.S. movie actress and 
favorite movie actress in 15 nations which are also surveyed for favorite 
movie, and movie actor and actress. 
</P>
<P>
"Batman" -- which set summer box office records -- was named favorite overall 
movie and co-favorite dramatic motion picture with "Steel Magnolias." 
</P>
<P>
Dustin Hoffman was named world favorite movie actor and Tom Cruise, an Academy 
Award nominee for his starring role in "Born on the Fourth of July," was named 
favorite movie actor. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to speculate on his Oscar chances next month, Cruise replied, "Can't I 
just enjoy this?" 
</P>
<P>
Arsenio Hall was named favorite late night talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
The awards are a popularity contest and are not voted on by members of the 
entertainment industry. The winners are chosen by an opinion poll conducted by 
the Gallup Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners at the show, broadcast live from Universal Studios, included Neil 
Patrick Harris, male performer in a new television series; Jamie Lee Curtis, 
female performer in a new TV series; Fred Savage, young TV performer; Randy 
Travis and Kenny Rogers, country music performers; Bobby Brown, male musical 
performer, and Paula Abdul, female musical performer. 
</P>
<P>
"Rescue 911" was named favorite new TV dramatic series; "Doogie Houser M.D." 
the favorite new comedy series and "Look Who's Talking" won for favorite comedy 
motion picture. "L.A. Law" was named favorite dramatic series for the fourth 
time.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: NON-ADDICTIVE PRUNE JUICE SAFE DAILY LAXATIVE OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON, TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question. Is it safe to drink prune juice every day to stay regular? Can a 
person become addicted to it? 
</P>
<P>
Answer. People have asked about addiction to lots of things -- sleeping pills, 
nose drops, coffee and sedatives -- but this is the first time anyone has ever 
asked about prune juice. Although we counsel against overuse of laxatives, we 
can't imagine anyone getting into trouble with prunes. 
</P>
<P>
The "funny" fruit is high in vitamins A and B-6, potassium, magnesium and 
fiber. You may not need to drink prune juice more than once or twice a week to 
stay regular, but there is no evidence that a daily dose of prunes is harmful. 
That's not true of many laxatives, herbal or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I read about Wellbutrin in a medical newsletter two years ago. They said it 
is supposed to enhance sexual desire. But my doctor says he has never heard of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
I know doctors sometimes prescribe estrogen for women with low libido, but I 
had cancer several years ago and can't take any form of estrogen. 
</P>
<P>
Please tell me if Wellbutrin is available and how well it works. I believe it 
could be a great help for a woman like me. 
</P>
<P>
A. Wellbutrin (bupropion) is a new antidepressant that works differently from 
conventional medications. It is less likely to cause drowsiness, mental 
confusion and constipation. Instead of weight gain, Wellbutrin may actually 
lead to weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
One unique "side effect" that has been reported with Wellbutrin is an increase 
in sexual interest. This reaction needs further study, however, and the company 
denies that the drug is an aphrodisiac. 
</P>
<P>
Because the drug does have the potential to cause adverse reactions, including 
nausea, headache, tremor, insomnia, jitteriness and occasionally seizures, it 
should not be used casually. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I would like to use a motion-sickness drug such as Antivert or Dramamine on 
trips. The label states, however, "Avoid use in case of enlarged prostate." 
</P>
<P>
I don't see the connection. What would Dramamine do to a man with prostate 
enlargement? 
</P>
<P>
A. Such medications can cause difficult or painful urination. You and other men 
with enlarged prostates are especially susceptible. In the worst case, you 
could find your bladder full but be unable to empty it, a urinary emergency 
that sometimes requires catheterization.

LIZ SMITH: LITERARY GUILD TRIUMPHANT IN FIGHT FOR 'DAZZLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE LATEST titanic struggle wasn't in the prize ring, or between warring and 
rich husbands and wives, or in the Hollywood offices of agents talking about 
billing. 
</P>
<P>
It happened between those two respectable giants of publishing, the 
Book-of-the-Month Club and the Literary Guild. They entered into a really 
competitive fight trying to buy the latest novel of Judith Krantz. The 
Book-of-the-Month Club seldom ever buys commercial fiction of the Krantz 
stripe; they are more likely to seek history and biography. However, they 
wanted "Dazzle." Judith's past work has always gone to the Literary Guild, and 
the Guild again nailed down "Dazzle." 
</P>
<P>
They offered agent Mort Janklow $900,000 for book club rights. This does not 
begin to be the money Judith will make on her latest effort. She already earned 
millions in a three-book deal with Crown. And then, of course, there is the 
mini-movie to be made after this one is published next January. 
</P>
<P>
P.S. TO a recent tale about the talent drain at NBC. Emmy winner Bob Jamieson, 
reported leaving, is very happy about his decision. His agent, Stuart Witt, 
says it was Bob's idea not to renew after 18 years at NBC. He will begin 
toiling at ABC's New York bureau in April. 
</P>
<P>
HERE'S WHAT Donald Trump told me when I rang to ask what he thinks of the 
rampant rumor that a local weekly plans to do a story on him and Amanda Burden, 
the beautiful and social stepdaughter of William S. Paley and former wife to 
Steve Ross and Carter Burden. 
</P>
<P>
Trump said: "This would be very unfair to Miss Burden. I haven't seen the lady 
physically in 10 years. I hardly know her. There is absolutely no attraction 
between us. I have said it before -- half the women I am linked to or mentioned 
with are ones I have never even met." 
</P>
<P>
Trump went on to rave about the opening of his Taj Mahal in Atlantic City on 
April 5. His good news? Donald says, "I am fine, and the Taj is virtually 
unprecedented! People thought it would never open! People said nobody could 
build it and finish it, let alone bring it in on budget and open on time!" 
</P>
<P>
I DON'T know what USA Today means when they print a pointless, truncated, 
taken-out-of-context little story under the headline "Liz Smith's Sticky 
Situation." I don't find myself in any sticky situation. I am used to being 
criticized; it happens every day. This time, again, it seems to be for "having 
an uncomfortably cozy relationship with some celebs." Or words to that effect. 
</P>
<P>
But please, don't panic. I still firmly believe that being given a gossip 
column to write under your own byline means you have the leeway to get as 
uncomfortably cozy with celebrities and names and important people as possible. 
It's part of this particular job and goes with the territory. And sometimes you 
get great stories that way, and sometimes you are stymied and don't. 
</P>
<P>
Another big negative flash for you is the horrid revelation that I use material 
from press agents from time to time. I don't know what people think the gossip 
business is, or what columns they ever read that don't use help. Even the 
President has a press agent, named Marlin Fitzwater. So do the Pentagon, the 
networks, all big business and most publications. It isn't against the law for 
press agents to make a living.

A five-carat diamond ring lost by Ringo Starr turned up recently at a jewelry 
shop and has been returned to the former Beatles drummer, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Starr, 49, lost the ring after a concert last October in the French capital. 
</P>
<P>
Police estimated its worth at more than $172,000. 
</P>
<P>
The ring surfaced a few weeks ago at a jewelry shop in the St. Ouen District of 
northern Paris, sold to the owner by a man police said did not know it belonged 
to the rock star. 
</P>
<P>
By that time the diamond had already passed "through several persons," police 
said. Investigators later found and matched it against a description provided 
by the insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
The ring has been returned to Starr, and police said the jewelry shop owner and 
the man who sold him the ring will face unspecified criminal charges.

Zsa Zsa Gabor, who sued Delta Air Lines for $10 million after she was ejected 
from a flight for letting her dogs roam free, has had her lawsuit tossed out of 
court for the moment, a federal judge said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said Gabor's attorneys can refile the 
complaint once they fix its flaws. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor sued alleging negligence, defamation and assault and battery after she 
was removed from Flight 462 while stopping in Atlanta en route from Los Angeles 
to West Palm Beach on Jan. 6, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
A flight attendant and the pilot asked their first-class passenger to put her 
dogs Genghis Kahn and Macho Man in her carry-on kennel, but she refused. "You 
know Zsa Zsa. She'll speak her mind," said her lawyer, Donald Norton. "She told 
the stewardess what she thought of her." 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, a Delta vice president boarded the Boeing 767 to ask again, but the 
airline said she rejected the requests with "considerable vulgarity" and was 
escorted off the flight by a police officer.

Cincinnati's traditional parade for the opening day of the baseball season was 
called off today because of the uncertainty created by the contract dispute 
between owners and players. 
</P>
<P>
"This would have been our 70th consecutive parade," said chairman Tony Bare of 
the sponsoring Findlay Market Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to have to postpone it until the next time." 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see something like this scrubbed," said Bare, a meat merchant at the 
Findlay Market, a street market near downtown Cincinnati. "I've been involved 
in the parade for 20 years. It's been a tradition in my family, as well as all 
the other merchants and folks down at Findlay Market." 
</P>
<P>
Bare said the parade cannot be rescheduled because it is a volunteer event and 
its participants cannot all rearrange their schedules for whenever club owners 
and players reach a collective bargaining agreement and start the season. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati has annually been the traditional site of the National League's 
season opener because the city is regarded as home of the nation's oldest 
professional team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, predecessors of today's 
Cincinnati Reds.

Oakland A's outfielder Jose Canseco picked off someone trying to steal -- his 
boat. 
</P>
<P>
A hapless thief tried to roar off with Canseco's 42-foot boat as the slugger 
played volleyball Sunday on South Beach, a popular Art Deco district of Miami 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The boat's engine wouldn't cooperate, and police arrested 27-year-old Gregory 
Dudley adrift as he tried in vain to start it, Miami Beach police spokesman Jim 
Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco had anchored near Penrod's Beach Club. "He swam in to play volleyball," 
Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
About 6 p.m., Canseco quit. He spotted someone hiding behind the boat console. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco called police, who responded quickly -- Metro Dade police with a 
helicopter, Miami Beach police with a boat. The Florida Marine Patrol responded 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Police corraled Dudley and the drifting boat. Dudley was charged with attempted 
grand theft.

1,100 ATTEND GATHERS 'SERVICE OF TRIUMPH'

The century-old stone church filled more than an hour before the farewells were 
said to Hank Gathers today by his Loyola Marymount teammates, friends and 
relatives at a "Service of Triumph" that lasted more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
There were 500 mourners inside Emanuel Institutional Baptist Church and 600 
more standing outside in the warm sunshine. Loudspeakers had been installed so 
everyone could hear coaches and congressmen remember the athlete. 
</P>
<P>
Burial was immediately after the service at Mount Lawn cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, 23, died a week ago Sunday after collapsing during a basketball game 
in Los Angeles. He had a condition diagnosed as an irregular heartbeat and was 
under orders to take medication. 
</P>
<P>
A large floral display above the casket at the front of the church had lettered 
in blue flowers on a white background, "My Son." Another at his head said in 
red, "Hank MVP 44" -- Gathers' uniform number at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
"We came to show our unified love and concern for him and his family," Loyola 
Marymount Coach Paul Westhead said Sunday night. He described Gathers as a 
"great friend that I personally and all the players loved." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Westhead said: "It was Hank's team. We played for him." 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Gathers told the congregation that he will always remember his brother 
as "a very positive person. He was loyal to his family, friends and fans." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Loyola team were pall bearers. 
</P>
<P>
People began arriving outside the church an hour before the doors opened at 
dusk Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Mourners were taken into the church Sunday 10 at a time, then ushered quickly 
past the coffin. 
</P>
<P>
One group carried a placard decorated with roses and signed by about 100 people 
from Gathers' old neighborhood, Jean Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, who lived behind the Gathers family, said: "He was a nice, quiet man. 
When he came home, all the kids would run to him. He always was patient with 
children, always took time for them." 
</P>
<P>
Behind Wallace was a group of youngsters who played ball with Gathers during 
summer mini-camps. 
</P>
<P>
"He was all right," 13-year-old Rahime Wagner said. "We'll miss him. Most 
definitely." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to playing basketball, Gathers would talk to them about their goals 
in life. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to tell us, 'Don't do drugs,' stuff like that," Rahime said. 
</P>
<P>
"And if we got suspended, he'd say, 'Don't do that. You got to stay in school,' 
" added 12-year-old Aubrey Brown. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't just a hero for the neighborhood kids, Robert Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
"All the people in the neighborhood were rooting for him," Wilkins, 26, said. 
"If Hank would have made it, we all would have felt like we were part of it. 
Like we could do the same." 
</P>
<P>
Clarence Chambers, 22, played on the South Philadelphia High School team that 
lost the Philadelphia Public League championship game to Gathers-led Murrell 
Dobbins Technical High School in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"They beat us good," he said. "You could see this guy had potential even then." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the large crowd waiting to pay their respects. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone with such a big heart touched so many people," he said.

BETTING THE SYSTEMS: THE DRIVER'S METHOD EARNS A SMALL PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN DASH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Lean Pirate came charging into the stretch to take the lead by a head this 
year Jan. 31 in a six-furlong sprint for 3-year-old maiden fillies, the race 
was practically over as far as the crowd was concerned. Bettors could see that 
the nag in this sixth race was the best of the eight-horse field, and she 
proved her worth when she extended her lead and won by 1 1/4 lengths over It's 
All Relative. 
</P>
<P>
Lean Pirate was the favorite of the field and paid backers $5.80 to win. As the 
totalizator board flashed the prices of the first three finishers in the race, 
"The Driver," turned from his favorite position by the rail at Santa Anita and 
strolled back to the betting windows to cash in his ticket. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't The Driver's first victory that day. He had already won two races and 
would cash in another, winning four of the six races that he bet. About 
6-foot-5, with sparse blond hair and a blond beard, and always in a dark suit, 
black tie and sunglasses, The Driver steers a stretch limousine for a 
businessman in Century City, picking up his boss at 7 in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
By noon, The Driver is finished with work until 7 the same evening, when he has 
to wait for his boss and take the man home. From noon to 7 p.m., The Driver 
likes to go to the track to bet the ponies. 
</P>
<P>
Because The Driver spends much of his time at the race track, he has devised a 
system that enables him to get through the day's races with a small profit. 
</P>
<P>
The Driver bets favorites that are less than 2-1 odds. This sort of system, of 
course, requires patience because backers of such a system don't bet every 
race. On most days, only about five to six races qualify. Sometimes only one 
qualifies. And if as many as seven do, that's a rarity. 
</P>
<P>
Since favorites of 2-1 odds or less win almost every day, The Driver will 
sometimes use a money management system instead of making straight bets. Once 
he wins, he goes back to his original bet, which is $2. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1989-90 season, until Feb. 28, there were 50 racing days. Only on 
four of these days was The Driver shut out. And of 214 races, The Driver cashed 
in 86, for a 40% winning percentage. 
</P>
<P>
The day that The Driver won with Lean Pirate, his first of four wins began in 
the second race where Bold and High, a 3-year-old maiden, took the lead at the 
quarter-pole, entered the stretch ahead by a large margin and hit the finish 2 
1/4 lengths in front. 
</P>
<P>
Bold and High paid backers $4.20 to win. The Driver's second victory was in the 
third race, where a 3-year-old filly, Fast Discovery, easily won a six-furlong 
race by 5 1/2 lengths, paying $3.80 to win. 
</P>
<P>
The Driver lost the fifth race, where the favorite, Ariosa, came in second to a 
long shot, Hail The Foxbaybe. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth, about 6 1/2 furlongs on the turf for 4-year-olds and up, fillies 
and mares, Dancing Tribute took on five other nags and easily romped to a 1 
1/4-length victory, paying $4.20 to win. The ninth race was a losing effort as 
the odds-on favorite, I Love Racing, after leading nearly all the way, hung on 
for second. 
</P>
<P>
Although The Driver posted four wins and two seconds for the day, all that 
counted were the four wins. Returns came to $18 and bets amounted to $12, for a 
$6 profit. 
</P>
<P>
For those who sneer at a measly $6 profit, consider The Driver's money 
management progression instead. 
</P>
<P>
For example, straight betting on Dec. 30, 1989, at Santa Anita would have 
resulted in a 60-cent loss as two horses won out of six races. However, a 
simple $2-4-8-16-32 progression would have resulted in a $12.40 profit. 
</P>
<P>
On that day, the first horse that qualified for The Driver was Redneck Ways in 
the second race, and it came in fourth. In the fifth race, the qualifier, Big 
English, pulled up and finished last in an 11-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
Hidden Beauty won the sixth and paid $5.80. The qualifier, Sexy Slew, lost the 
seventh race, but Tarascon raced home by 2 1/2 lengths to win the eighth and 
pay $5.60. In the ninth race, K's Charger, another horse that ran into trouble, 
pulled up and finished last. 
</P>
<P>
The most winners in a day at Santa Anita for the system came Feb. 15, when five 
of six horses finished first. After the initial qualifying horse lost, there 
were five consecutive wins by system nags, paying $3.60, $4, $4.60, $3.40 and 
$4.80. 
</P>
<P>
Total betting was $12, and returns came to $20.40 for an $8.40 profit. 
</P>
<P>
Extreme self-control and patience were exhibited by The Driver on Jan. 25 when 
after the qualifying horse, Scotch and Irish, lost the first race, he made no 
other bets and left the track a $2 loser. 
</P>
<P>
Most people at that point would have discarded the system like passengers and 
crew fleeing the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
The Driver believes, however, that once you make a commitment, you have to 
stick to it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like a legal contract," he will tell listeners, "but it's a matter of 
dedication and discipline. Just like the horses themselves. Although they lose 
practically all of their races, they just keep coming back for more. Now that's 
discipline!"

FOR BRADY CREATORS, THE FAMILY AFFAIR GOES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sherwood Schwartz and Lloyd Schwartz, executive producers of "The Bradys," used 
to look forward to meeting all the other father-and-son writer-producer teams 
in Hollywood -- maybe hosting an occasional picnic. 
</P>
<P>
Then they discovered that there weren't any. 
</P>
<P>
"You're looking at the only father-and-son writing-and-producing team," 
Sherwood Schwartz, 73, said proudly during the pair's first father-and-son 
interview at Paramount Studios, where they were hard at work several weeks ago 
on "The Bradys," which reunited the characters from the popular 1969-74 "The 
Brady Bunch." 
</P>
<P>
"That happens to be truth," Lloyd Schwartz, 43, said with equal pride. "There 
are other father-and-son teams who do different things, but we do the same 
thing -- producing and writing a show together." 
</P>
<P>
For the Schwartzes, 1990 is a special year: It marks Sherwood's 50th 
anniversary in show business and Lloyd's 25th. Sherwood, who holds a master's 
degree in medical sciences, changed his career to show biz when his brother, a 
writer, drafted him to write jokes for Bob Hope's radio show in 1939. Lloyd 
started working parttime in the industry while still in college. 
</P>
<P>
1990 also marks the third decade in the life of the Schwartzes' other family, 
the Bradys -- created when Sherwood dreamed up the idyllic story of "a lovely 
lady" with three daughters and "a man named Brady" with three sons who got 
married. They became what Sherwood says was TV's first blended family. 
</P>
<P>
The future of "The Bradys" in the '90s remains uncertain. CBS aired just six 
episodes as a mid-season replacement; the series ended its run last Friday. 
Although the first episode, a two-hour movie, got good ratings, the program 
then dropped into the Bottom 20 and stayed there. 
</P>
<P>
Sherwood blamed the show's disappointing ratings on the fact that the first 
several hourlong episodes that ran at 8 p.m. were cut-down versions of two-hour 
Brady movies that CBS initially planned to air in 9 p.m. time slots, with story 
lines more appropriate for an older audience. The producers tried lighter 
stories for the last two episodes, but to no avail. The Schwartzes hope the 
series airs at 9 when it is re-run over the summer, and once again recaptures 
the Brady audience. 
</P>
<P>
But if it doesn't, the Schwartzes remain satisfied with the brief family 
reunion. "We're following through on things we started 20 years ago," Lloyd 
said. "There has been a sense of completion every step of the way." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, an end to "The Bradys" would not mark the end of the Schwartz 
partnership, he said. Although declining to give specifics, he said he and his 
father are producing a feature film and a play together, along with pursuing 
other film and theater projects on their own. 
</P>
<P>
The Schwartzes say the key to their successful partnership -- which includes 
teaching a television production course together in UCLA's extension program -- 
is the time they spend apart. "I think the way we are able to deal with it is 
that we have our own lives, we do other things, so we enjoy coming together," 
Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
But both Lloyd and Sherwood acknowledge that the arrangement has disadvantages, 
particularly for Lloyd. Lloyd, a recent UCLA graduate when "The Brady Bunch" 
was launched, struggled with concerns about nepotism before reluctantly 
agreeing to become dialogue coach for the kids on the show. And he concedes 
that he has felt the shadow of his father's accomplishments: Not only did 
Sherwood create the Bradys, he also got a head start in TV comedy by creating 
"Gilligan's Island" in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some loss of identity for me when we come together," Lloyd said. "You 
always read: 'Sherwood Schwartz's "The Bradys" ' -- well, it's the two of us. 
We did it together. But I understand all that, and there's no problem about it 
between us." 
</P>
<P>
The Bradys have undergone several reincarnations on all three networks since 
the happy family made its debut on ABC in 1969. There was the short-lived "The 
Brady Bunch Hour" variety show on ABC in 1977 and "The Brady Brides" series on 
NBC in 1981, also short-lived. CBS finally struck gold in 1988 with "A Very 
Brady Christmas," which brought the Brady clan back together for the holidays 
and won the network some of its highest ratings ever for a made-for-TV movie. 
</P>
<P>
The success of that movie led to the recent series, a drama in which the Brady 
parents, played by Robert Reed and Florence Henderson, had become grandparents; 
the Brady kids were troubled and thirtysomething, with spouses, children and 
pets. 
</P>
<P>
About the only similarity between the old Bradys and the new Bradys was the 
negative reaction of the TV critics. Sherwood recalled fondly that they hated 
"Gilligan's Island," too. Like "The Cosby Show's" Huxtable family that 
succeeded them, the Bradys have been attacked for two decades for presenting a 
too-rosy view of family life. 
</P>
<P>
After 20 years, however, the Schwartzes have learned to live with it. 
</P>
<P>
"Now 'Gilligan' is a cult classic, and so is ('The Brady Bunch')," Sherwood 
said. "I honestly think I could sit down and write a show tonight that the 
critics would love, and I know it would be canceled within four weeks. I know 
what the critics love. We write and produce for people, not for critics." 
</P>
<P>
Nor do the Schwartzes believe the relentlessly cheerful Bradyness of the family 
to be less realistic than life in more troubled families. In fact, life with 
the Brady Bunch was a lot like life with the Schwartz Bunch; many of the show's 
stories developed out of happenings in the Schwartz household. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people say television holds up a mirror to life, and that's why you 
see all the drug busts and the killings and the seamier side of life," Sherwood 
said. "I personally take the view that as a responsible producer, it's not 
sufficient to portray only negative role models. I think it's better to give an 
alternative. It's not enough to say no to drugs. What do you say 'yes' to?" 
</P>
<P>
The Schwartzes complain that today's situation comedies have lost the 
"humanity" that "The Brady Bunch" and "Gilligan's Island" had.

"Now they're brittle -- it's joke, joke, joke," Sherwood said. "The truth is, 
as hokey-pokey as 'Gilligan' was, with a lot of broad comedy, there were times 
when whole pages of dialogue would go by that was serious. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone could sit down and watch either of those shows and not 
get the feeling that that's the way they'd like life to be, the way they'd like 
people to treat each other," he added. "In 'Gilligan's Island,' the sum is 
greater than all the pieces, and the same is true of 'The Brady Bunch.' "

<TEXT>
<P>
Barack Obama stares silently at a wall of fading black-and-white photographs in 
the muggy second-floor offices of the Harvard Law Review. He lingers over one 
row of solemn faces, his predecessors of 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
All are men. All are dressed in dark-colored suits and ties. All are white. 
</P>
<P>
It is a sobering moment for Obama, 28, who in February became the first black 
to be elected president in the 102-year history of the prestigious student-run 
law journal. 
</P>
<P>
The post, considered the highest honor a student can attain at Harvard Law 
School, almost always leads to a coveted clerkship with the U.S. Supreme Court 
after graduation and a lucrative offer from the law firm of one's choice. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Obama, who has gone deep into debt to meet the $25,000-a-year cost of a 
Harvard Law School education, has left many in disbelief by asserting that he 
wants neither. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the luxuries of going to Harvard Law School is it means you can take 
risks in your life," Obama said recently. "You can try to do things to improve 
society and still land on your feet. That's what a Harvard education should buy 
-- enough confidence and security to pursue your dreams and give something 
back." 
</P>
<P>
After graduation next year, Obama says he probably will spend two years at a 
corporate law firm, then look for community work. Down the road, he plans to 
run for public office. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a Kenyan economist and an American anthropologist, Obama is a tall 
man with a quick, boyish smile whose fellow students rib him about his 
trademark tattered blue jeans. 
</P>
<P>
"I come from a lot of worlds and I have had the unique opportunity to move 
through different circles," Obama said. "I have worked and lived in poor black 
communities and I can translate some of their concerns into words that the 
larger society can embrace." 
</P>
<P>
His own upbringing is a blending of diverse cultures. Born in Hawaii, where his 
parents met in college, Obama was named Barack (blessed in Arabic) after his 
father. The elder Obama was among a generation of young Africans who came to 
the United States to study engineering, finance and medicine, skills that could 
be taken back home to build a new, strong Africa. In Hawaii, he married Obama's 
mother, a white American from Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, Obama's parents separated and he moved to a small village 
outside Jakarta, Indonesia, with his mother, an anthropologist. There, he spent 
his boyhood playing with the sons and daughters of rice farmers and rickshaw 
drivers, attending an Indonesian-speaking school, where he had little contact 
with Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Every morning at 5, his mother would wake him to take correspondence classes 
for fear he would forget his English. 
</P>
<P>
It was in Indonesia, Obama said, where he first became aware of abject poverty 
and despair. 
</P>
<P>
"It left a very strong mark on me living there because you got a real sense of 
just how poor folks can get," he said. "You'd have some army general with 24 
cars and if he drove one once then eight servants would come around and wash it 
right away. But on the next block, you'd have children with distended bellies 
who just couldn't eat." 
</P>
<P>
After six years in Indonesia, Obama was sent back to the United States to live 
with his maternal grandparents in Hawaii in preparation for college. It was 
then that he began to correspond with his father, a senior economist for the 
Kenyan finance ministry who recounted intriguing tales of an African heritage 
that Obama knew little about. 
</P>
<P>
Obama treasured his father's tales of walking miles to school, using a machete 
to hack a path through the elephant grass -- the legends and traditions of the 
Luo tribe, a proud people who inhabited the shores of Lake Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
He still carries a passbook that belonged to his grandfather, an herbalist who 
was the first family member to leave the small Kenyan village of Alego, move to 
the city and don Western clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a cook and he used to have to carry this passbook to work for the 
English," Obama recalls. "At the age of 46 it had this description of him that 
said, 'He's a colored boy, he's responsible and he's a good cook.' " 
</P>
<P>
Two generations later, at the most widely respected legal journal in the 
country, the grandson of the cook is giving the orders. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some of Obama's peers question the motives of this second-year law student. 
They find it puzzling that despite Obama's openly progressive views on social 
issues, he has also won support from staunch conservatives. Ironically, he has 
come under the most criticism from fellow black students for being too 
conciliatory toward conservatives and not choosing more blacks to other top 
positions on the law review. 
</P>
<P>
"He's willing to talk to them (the conservatives) and he has a grasp of where 
they are coming from, which is something a lot of blacks don't have and don't 
care to have," said Christine Lee, a second-year law student who is black. "His 
election was significant at the time, but now it's meaningless because he's 
becoming just like all the others (in the Establishment)." 
</P>
<P>
Although some question what personal goals motivate Obama, his interest in 
social issues is deeply grounded. 
</P>
<P>
At Occidental College in Los Angeles, Obama studied international relations and 
spent much of his time helping to organize anti-apartheid protests. In his 
junior year, he transferred to Columbia University, "more for what (New York 
City) had to offer than for the education," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating, Obama landed a job writing manuals for a New York-based 
international trade publication. Once his college loans were paid off, he took 
a $13,000-a-year job as director for the Developing Communities Project, a 
church-based social action group in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
There, he and a coalition of ministers set out to improve living conditions in 
poor neighborhoods plagued by crime and high unemployment. Obama helped form a 
tenants' rights group in the housing projects and established a job training 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a chance and it paid off," he said. "It was probably the best education 
that I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
After four years, Obama decided it was time to move on. He wanted to learn how 
to use the political system to effect social change. He set his sights on 
Harvard Law School, where he quickly distinguished himself as a top student. He 
was soon chosen through the strength of his writing and grades to serve as one 
of 80 student editors on the law review. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many peer-review professional journals, the law review is run solely by 
students. It is widely considered the major forum for current legal debate and 
consequently is watched closely by courts around the country. 
</P>
<P>
In his second year at law school, Obama decided to run for law review president 
after a conversation with a black friend. 
</P>
<P>
"I said I was not planning to run and he said, 'Yes you are because that is a 
door that needs to be kicked down and you can take it down.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was a marathon selection process, an arcane throwback to the early days of 
the review. The students editors deliberated behind closed doors from 8:30 a.m. 
until early the next day. The 19 anxious candidates took turns cooking 
breakfast, lunch and dinner for the selection committee, whose members emerged 
with a historic decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I could say a word, another black student who was running just came up 
and grabbed me and hugged me real hard," Obama recalled. "It was then that I 
knew it was more than just about me. It was about us. And I am walking through 
a lot of doors that had already been opened by others." 
</P>
<P>
But few students at the law review were prepared for the deluge of interview 
requests for Obama from newspapers, radio and television stations. Strange 
letters of congratulations began arriving. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the elections, a package turned up at the law review office with 
no return address. Obama said he hesitated to open it because of the spree of 
recent mail bombings targeted at civil rights activists nationwide. When the 
package was finally opened, inside were two packages of dim sum, with no 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Some students made light of the media invasion, posting a memo titled "The 
Barack Obama Story, a Made for TV Movie, Starring Blair Underwood as Barack 
Obama." 
</P>
<P>
Yet tensions were building. White students grumbled about the attention paid to 
Obama's race. Black students criticized him for not choosing more blacks for 
other top positions at the review. Caught in the cross-fire, Obama, who has a 
tendency toward understatement, downplayed his own achievements. 
</P>
<P>
"For every one of me, there are thousands of young black kids with the same 
energies, enthusiasm and talent that I have who have not gotten the opportunity 
because of crime, drugs and poverty," he said. "I think my election does 
symbolize progress but I don't want people to forget that there is still a lot 
of work to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Describing Obama, fellow students and professors point to a self-confidence 
tempered by modesty as one of his greatest attributes. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very unusual, in the sense that other students who might have something 
approximating his degree of insight are very intimidating to other students or 
inconsiderate and thoughtless," said Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law 
professor. "He's able to build upon what other students say and see what's 
valuable in their comments without belittling them." 
</P>
<P>
But what truly distinguishes Obama from other bright students at Harvard Law, 
Tribe said, is his ability to make sense of complex legal arguments and 
translate them into current social concerns. For example, Tribe said, Obama 
wrote an insightful research article showing how contrasting views in the 
abortion debate are a direct result of cultural and sociological differences. 
</P>
<P>
As law review president, Obama is the last person to edit student articles, as 
well as longer pieces by accomplished legal scholars. The review publishes 
eight times a year and receives about 600 free-lance articles each year. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to his fellow students at the review, whom he edits, he said: "These 
are the people who will be running the country in some form or other when they 
graduate. If I'm talking to a white conservative who wants to dismantle the 
welfare state, he has the respect to listen to me and I to him. That's the 
biggest value of the Harvard Law Review. Ideas get fleshed out and there is no 
party line to follow." 
</P>
<P>
Obama spends 50 to 60 hours each week on law review business. The full-time 
volunteer job leaves little time for an additional 12 hours of class, plus 
homework. When it comes to choosing between the two, as it often does, Obama 
usually misses class. 
</P>
<P>
One of Obama's most difficult tasks as editor in chief is keeping the peace 
amid the clashing egos of writers and editors. 
</P>
<P>
"He is very, very diplomatic," said Radhika Rao, 24, a third-year law student 
from Lexington, Ind. "He is very outgoing and has a lot of experience in 
handling people, which stands him in good stead." 
</P>
<P>
Tina Ulrich, 24, a third-year student, wrote an article for the review that 
went through several editors before her final draft landed on Obama's desk. 
</P>
<P>
"When he sent it back, it had lots of tiny print all over it and I was just 
furious," she said. "My heart just sank. But it was accompanied by specific 
examples of how parts could be made better. He wound up getting an enthusiastic 
response from a very tired writer." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the review, other blacks at Harvard are skeptical that Obama's 
appointment will change much at the Ivy League institution, where 180 out of 
1,601 law students are black. 
</P>
<P>
"While I applaud Obama's achievement, I guess I am not as hopeful for what this 
will mean for other blacks at Harvard," said Derrick Bell, the school's first 
black tenured law professor. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a strange character to this black achievement. When you have someone 
that reaches this high level, you find that he is just deemed exceptional and 
it does not change society's view of all of the rest."

KOREAN-AMERICAN LEADER TRYING TO GIVE FELLOW IMMIGRANTS A HAND

<P>
The annoying back pains that businessman Mitchel Bang endures are constant 
reminders of the 14-hour days that he spent selling, repairing and delivering 
furniture when he opened his furniture store in Los Angeles about 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, all that backbreaking labor prompted him to put his business on the 
back burner for a while and do something to help his fellow Korean-Americans. 
He decided to take time away from his Western Avenue furniture store to devote 
more time to duties as president of the Korean Chamber of Commerce of Los 
Angeles. His goal is to educate others in the Southland about the 
Korean-American community, which has grown to 350,000 from 60,000 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Half of that community's population owns small businesses, often working 
incredibly long hours to keep food on the table, Bang said. 
</P>
<P>
This month, he hopes to distribute a 45-minute, bilingual videotape titled 
"Welcome to Koreatown, Los Angeles," to governments, libraries and elsewhere. 
The idea is to introduce outsiders to Koreatown, a business center for 
Korean-Americans -- bounded by Olympic and Crenshaw boulevards and Eighth and 
Hoover streets. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell and Korean Airlines together donated $35,000 to the $60,000 
project, Bang said from his second-floor office in Koreatown. It overlooks his 
first apartment in America, on Western Avenue and Venice Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, first-generation Korean-Americans have mostly kept to themselves 
because of cultural and language differences. But, Bang said, "we've got to mix 
things up. We cannot live separately." 
</P>
<P>
Demographics experts say that by 2000 the Korean-American community could top 1 
million in Southern California, which already has the largest concentration of 
Koreans outside Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Before his term with the chamber ends June 30, Bang said, he wants to provide 
information to Korean-Americans on how to create new businesses and to 
participate in the 1990 Census. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the leader of the chamber's 700 business members typifies the 
first-generation Korean immigrant. Now 55, Bang came to the United States in 
1964 to study business at USC. His plan was to return to his family in Seoul 
after graduation. But he soon found himself having to put USC aside and work as 
a machinist to earn money. He later attended a business college and found a 
computer programming job. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Helen, joined him three years later. She opened a wig shop in 
Hollywood with part of the money they received from selling their home in 
Korea. "The Korean government wouldn't let us take all $100,000," Bang said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many immigrants, Bang had learned some English in Korea. But the new 
language was still difficult. 
</P>
<P>
He opened his furniture store in the early 1970s. His wife had become pregnant 
and found it difficult to operate the wig shop. He used profits from her shop 
and a $40,000 bank loan to finance the opening. 
</P>
<P>
"I found that there could be a future in the furniture business because people 
coming from Korea . . . naturally were trying to buy furniture from the people 
who can make the communication easier," Bang said. Eighty percent of his 
customers were Korean. 
</P>
<P>
Bang bought and sold furniture during the day and made deliveries at night. 
"We're not taking time off. That's the secret," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bang also is chairman of United Citizens National Bank in Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
Many Korean immigrants work 80 to 90 hours a week in low-paying jobs after they 
arrive here, partly because of language difficulties. So they often try to 
launch their own businesses in Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
After working assiduously for several years, some manage to save enough to open 
businesses. Others bring capital with them from Korea, and some obtain money by 
participating in a kye -- a rotating credit system built on trust. Kye 
participants contribute $100 to $20,000 monthly, and the pooled capital is 
loaned to different members each month. 
</P>
<P>
There are 2,700 Korean grocery and liquor store owners in the Southland. They 
account for 18%, or $1.5 billion, of the total grocery and liquor-market sales 
in Southern California, according to the Korean-American Grocers Assn. of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Bang has earned praise from his community since his early days here, community 
leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
John Cho, general manager of the 450-member Korean American Garment Industry 
Assn. of California, said Bang often participates in community church and youth 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin B. Hong, president of Hanmi Bank in Koreatown, welcomes Bang's plans 
to desegregate the Korean-American community, calling them "futuristic." 
</P>
<P>
Hong said Bang is an aggressive leader. He noted that Bang spearheaded Gov. 
George Deukmejian's first visit to Koreatown last year and has arranged 
meetings between Korean-American business people and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Bang) is doing a good job to bridge the gap between the Korean community 
and mainstream society," said Hong, whose bank's assets top $130 million. 
</P>
<P>
Recently Bang organized a dinner that 100 African-American and Korean-American 
business people attended to discuss ways to smooth relations between blacks and 
Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
Korean merchants sometimes clash with non-Korean customers and neighborhood 
residents. They say language differences are a major contributor to these 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
In South-Central Los Angeles, for example, some residents complain that Korean 
merchants are abrupt and rude and that they locate businesses there simply to 
exploit the area. The merchants contend that they are simply misunderstood and 
that they locate there because costs are less than elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't explain themselves," Bang said of the merchants. "Even I sometimes 
can barely make myself understood." But language problems are no excuse for 
rudeness, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Ussery, co-chairman of the Black-Korean Alliance, said networking with 
each might allow both groups to find "million-dollar projects" that they can 
launch jointly. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance was formed in 1986 after three Korean merchants were killed in 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
After the dinner, a cautious John W. Mack, president of the Los Angeles Urban 
League, said: "It will take more than lip service by both Korean business 
leaders and blacks (for results). There will have to be rolling up of the 
shirt-sleeves and work." 
</P>
<P>
Bang gave the alliance a $1,500 check for scholarships. Later, he said, 
relations will be eased as the second generation, which is more assimilated, 
replaces the older generation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all a matter of time," he said.
