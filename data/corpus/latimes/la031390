KTTV TO BE MOVED TO MOVIE STUDIO AS PART OF $200-MILLION PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Fox Inc. announced plans Monday to move the company's KTTV television station 
operation from Hollywood to the historic 20th Century Fox studio in Century 
City as part of a $200-million renovation and expansion of the property, which 
had previously been targeted for condominium development. 
</P>
<P>
The turnabout reflects an effort to build a state-of-the art film and 
television production company in one place, Fox Chairman Barry Diller said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
It also is a major departure from previous plans for the 54-acre studio, whose 
standing movie sets can be seen from its entrance at Motor Avenue and Pico 
Boulevard, just west of Avenue of the Stars. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Fox, under different ownership, agreed to a city zoning plan that 
would have permitted the development of 2,200 condominium units. The studio 
would have been razed and production moved elsewhere, probably outside Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The studio and its parent company, Fox Inc., are owned by publishing baron 
Rupert Murdoch, whose company, News Corp. Ltd., bought Fox in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Diller said dismantling the studio would be a shortsighted decision, one 
reflecting a narrow, old-fashioned view of film-making as a process involving 
"four covered walls in a thing called a sound stage." Technological 
advancements, particularly in editing and sound, call for consolidating the 
television and movie functions on one site, he said. 
</P>
<P>
To build the facility that Diller envisions, Fox proposes the addition of 
800,000 square feet of production, stage and office facilities to the 1.1 
million square feet already there. Diller said the new construction would be 
"low-rise and low-density in character." 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles zoning change would be necessary, but Diller predicted that city 
officials and the studio's neighbors would find the studio expansion "eminently 
more desired" than condominiums. "I can't conceive of it the other way around. 
I'd be surprised that anyone would say there would be a desire for more 
Westside housing." 
</P>
<P>
City officials and vocal area homeowner organizations are likely, however, to 
view the switch in plans with skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents the Century City area, said Monday 
that the plan outlined by Diller was "worth considering. But it's worth 
considering with a critical eye." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said 20th Century Fox "is a major factor in what makes L.A. the 
entertainment capital of the world. . . . We'd like them to stay. But it has to 
be on terms acceptable to the city and to their neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Yaroslavsky backed the condominium plan as a good way to break up the 
sprawl of Century City with less-dense residential uses, as did local residents 
who were suffering from traffic congestion. (Century City itself was developed 
in the 1960s on what had been the studio back lot.) 
</P>
<P>
Initial reaction from homeowner groups was mixed Monday, in part because of a 
lack of detailed information. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there will be a great deal of neighborhood opposition," said Dick 
Harmetz, a former board member of the Tract 7260 Assn., a nearby homeowners 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Others in his association who had participated in a preliminary meeting with 
Fox, however, were more upbeat about the prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a low-rise studio complex is a lot better than high-rise 
condominiums," if the traffic impact is as Fox states it, said John French, 
founding president of the Tract 7260 group. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Lake, president of Friends of Westwood, said, "The answer from our 
community will be a resounding 'No way!' " 
</P>
<P>
Century City development over the past decade, she said, was predicated on 
eventually replacing the Fox studio with condominiums, which generate less 
traffic than commercial developments. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing we need is another office building," Lake said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Fox study, the condominium development would have generated 
about 16,000 daily automobile trips, while the expanded studio will generate 
14,800 trips. Relocating the television station adds 210 to the studio work 
force, which is now about 1,800. 
</P>
<P>
Diller said that relocation of the studio outside the city remains a 
possibility if the renovation plans are thwarted. 
</P>
<P>
"We have concluded . . . that we will be able to remain at this location only 
if our current facilities may be rehabilitated and new facilities constructed 
to provide the flexibility necessary to remain competitive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not going forward with the condominium development means shelving a 
controversial plan to extend Century Park West from Olympic Boulevard to Pico 
Boulevard, Diller said.

DRUG DEALER, BODYGUARD ON TRIAL FOR 1981 LAUREL CANYON KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
A convicted narcotics dealer and his former bodyguard went on trial Monday in 
Los Angeles County Superior Court for the 1981 murders of four people in a 
Laurel Canyon home who were allegedly killed in retaliation for an earlier 
drug-related robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Two men, Adel "Eddie Nash" Nasrallah, 59, and Gregory Diles, 40 are charged 
with the murders, which were first blamed on the late adult film star John 
Holmes, who was tried and acquitted for homicide in the case in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy District Attorney Dale Davidson told two separate Superior Court juries 
Monday that the evidence will show that Nasrallah and Diles are responsible for 
the slayings. In response, defense attorney Ed Rucker, who represents 
Nasrallah, said: "We know someone other than the defendants committed the 
murders. We're gonna prove it." 
</P>
<P>
Rucker said he would identify those others at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe Nash ordered Diles and others to kill the four victims in a 
Laurel Canyon residence on July 1, 1981 in revenge for a robbery that two of 
them had allegedly committed at Nasrallah's Studio City home two days before. 
</P>
<P>
Bludgeoned to death in the attack were William Deverell, 42, Joy Miller, 46, 
Barbara Richardson, 22, and Ronald Lanius. Beaten and left for dead was Lanuis' 
wife, Susan, 25, who survived but was unable to identify the assailants because 
of brain damage. Deverell and Lanuis had allegedly participated in the robbery 
at Nash's home. 
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah, once described by Holmes as "the most evil man I've ever know," and 
Diles, have pleaded innocent to four counts of first-degree murder and one 
count of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, they could be sentenced to death. Diles and the Lebanese-born 
Nasrallah remain in custody without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah and Diles will be tried together, but in an unusual arrangement, each 
defendent will have his own jury. That is because prosecutors plan to introduce 
statements each man allegedly made implicating himself and his co-defendant in 
the murders. 
</P>
<P>
Under California law, Nasrallah's alleged statements impicating himself and 
Diles can only be used against Nasrallah. Likewise, Diles' alleged statements 
implicating himself and Nasrallah can only be used against Diles. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, when Nash's alleged statements are introduced at the trial, only his 
jury will hear them. Diles' jury will leave the court at that time. Nash's jury 
will leave the court when Diles' alleged statements are introduced. 
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah and Diles were long suspected of being involved in the slayings, but 
were not formally charged until September 1988, more than seven years after the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
Charges were brought against the pair after prosecutors said they had uncovered 
new evidence in the case, including the testimony of Scott Thorson, a former 
lover of the late entertainer Liberace. 
</P>
<P>
Thorson testified at the preliminary hearing in the case that Nash never 
directly admitted that he had ordered the killings, but after the slayings, 
lamented that he had decided to send Diles and Holmes to the Laurel Canyon 
residence to retrieve the drugs and cash. 
</P>
<P>
Thorson sued Liberace in 1982 in a palimony suit which was settled out of court 
in 1984. Liberace died of AIDS in January 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes, a superstar in the pornographic film industry, was tried and acquitted 
of the murders. He died of AIDS in March 1988 at age 43.

POLICE OVERUSED STUN GUNS, WORKERS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES CONTEND THAT A PATIENT WHO LATER DIED WAS 
JOLTED MANY MORE TIMES THAN OFFICERS ADMIT. A CORONER'S INVESTIGATION IS 
CONTINUING.

<P>
A Ventura County coroner's report released Monday sharply contradicts the 
Ventura Police Department's version of events preceding the death last month of 
a 24-year-old psychiatric patient who was shocked repeatedly with electric stun 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Duane Johnson of Oxnard was jolted four times with the weapons 
before his death. But, according to the coroner's report, two mental-health 
workers told county investigators that stun guns were used from seven to 11 
times on the man during the 45 minutes before his death. 
</P>
<P>
The workers, who witnessed the incident, maintained that officers shocked 
Johnson at least six times with a stun gun after they gained control of him in 
his hospital room Feb. 13, according to the report by coroner's investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The workers complained that the patient, tethered face-down on a gurney, was 
unnecessarily shocked with the weapons as officers moved him from his room at 
Ventura County Medical Center to a county psychiatric facility nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who was in the hospital because of a near-fatal heart attack two weeks 
before his death, was "restrained and not a threat to himself or others," one 
worker told investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Officers continued to apply a stun gun to Johnson because he ignored their 
commands not to grab for hospital workers who were accompanying him to the 
mental facility, the workers said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have maintained that Johnson, a muscular former athlete, was shocked 
once with a small Nova stun gun by Officer Lynn Klamser and three times with a 
larger Taser weapon by Sgt. George Morris. 
</P>
<P>
Both weapons fire electrical charges of about 50,000 volts, which police say is 
similar to a jolt received when an automobile spark plug wire is touched. 
</P>
<P>
The weapons were used, police said, to force the patient to release his grip on 
a glass medical instrument during the initial struggle in the hospital room 
and, a few minutes later, to force him to release a hospital worker's leg. 
Johnson's hands were handcuffed to the gurney railing, but he was able to move 
his arms parallel to the rails. 
</P>
<P>
The Taser was applied twice more when Johnson refused to be handcuffed while 
being moved from the gurney into an isolation room, police said. He died about 
45 minutes after the incident began and at least five minutes after the final 
Taser jolt, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers using the stun guns were unaware of Johnson's heart problems, police 
Lt. Michael J. Tracy said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We stand by the account we made previously," Tracy said, responding to the 
coroner's report. "We've completed our investigation and sent it to the 
district attorney, and now it's up to him to review various reports and do 
what's appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office has refused to comment on the case until its 
investigation is concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department, after an investigation by homicide detectives, cleared 
the four officers in the Johnson incident, Tracy said. Hospital and 
mental-health employees interviewed by police supported the officers' version 
of events, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Department policy allows officers to use stun guns -- which are considered a 
non-lethal alternative to nightsticks and firearms -- to control people who 
pose a threat to officers or to the public. They also can be used to force 
crime suspects to comply with officers' instructions. 
</P>
<P>
County Coroner F. Warren Lovell said he had not yet determined whether shocks 
from the stun guns were the cause of Johnson's death, or if they contributed to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"This case is going to be a tough call," the coroner said. "This man had so 
many other things wrong with him." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had chronic heart disease and probably would have died Jan. 28 of a 
severe cardiac arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, had he not already been a 
patient at the mental-health facility, about 300 feet from the medical center's 
emergency room, Lovell said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's "fighting and struggling" during the incident two weeks later put 
additional stress on his heart, the coroner said. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to the coroner's investigative report, at least one police 
officer may have applied the stun weapons to Johnson in durations longer than 
the one- to two-second bursts reported by police. Departmental policy calls for 
such short applications. 
</P>
<P>
One mental-health worker, Ferris D. Grubb, told investigators that when 
officers transferred Johnson to the isolation room, one held a Taser to his 
shoulder blades "the entire time" it took to bring his rigid arms from his side 
to behind his back for handcuffing, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Grubb did not feel this was necessary and told the officers. . . . They 
did not respond," coroner's investigator Dale E. Zentzis said in the report. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Tracy agreed that Morris kept the Taser on Johnson's back during the 
handcuffing, but said he took his finger off the trigger after two separate 
bursts of one or two seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Flick, the second health worker, also said he thought the officers' 
repeated use of the Taser was unnecessary, Zentzis said. 
</P>
<P>
Lovell said that "prolonged application of the Taser would certainly contribute 
to the problem. The question now is how much did he get. . . . That's crucial." 
But, with the contradictory accounts, "I don't know if we're ever going to know 
the truth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's death is the second in three years in Ventura County that has 
followed the use of stun guns by police officers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Lovell found that jolts from a small Nova stun gun contributed to the 
death of a Port Hueneme man who died of heart failure while intoxicated with 
cocaine. Police had been called when the man barricaded himself in his bedroom 
with his girlfriend's two children. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office found that the officers had acted according to 
their training and violated no law.

UNION LISTING TIED TO 'DONATION,' OPTOMETRIST SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN: SEVEN OPTOMETRISTS HAVE MADE $500 DONATIONS TO THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN 
OF THE UNION PRESIDENT'S SON.

<P>
A San Diego optometrist says she was told last year that, to get client 
referrals from the 15,000-member retail clerk's union, she would have to make 
an annual "donation of $500 to a group of the union's choice in my name," The 
Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
The allegation, made in a letter last month from Allied Gardens optometrist M. 
Melinda Wells, is being reviewed by two state agencies for possible violations 
of state law. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was sent four months after seven optometrists already on the union's 
referral list donated $500 each to the fledgling state Assembly campaign of San 
Diego attorney Darrel Vandeveld -- son of union president Thomas J. Vandeveld. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the senior Vandeveld adamantly disputed the allegation by Wells, 
saying there was "absolutely not" any understanding that health care providers 
to the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Local 135 would be expected to make 
$500 donations at the union's direction each year. 
</P>
<P>
Vandeveld said that the spate of donations to his son's campaign from the 
optometrists was probably the result of a fund-raising letter he sent out last 
October on union stationery to optometrists, dentists and other health care 
professionals catering to his union membership. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my son's campaign is good for labor and I want to help my son, like 
any father would," said Vandeveld, Local 135 president for 16 years. The local 
represents retail and drug store clerks, dental assistants and meat cutters. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Michioku, a spokeswoman for the state's Fair Political Practices 
Commission, confirmed Monday that the political watchdog group has received a 
complaint and is reviewing the allegation. The state Board of Optometry is also 
investigating the allegation as a possible misdemeanor violation of state law. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a general provision that prohibits any kickbacks, rebates or 
discounts for the referral of patients, clients and customers," said Karen 
Ollinger, executive officer for the optometry board. "We've had an inquiry into 
it and we're looking into it." 
</P>
<P>
The allegation was made in a Feb. 28 letter to the California Optometric Assn. 
from Wells, the Allied Gardens optometrist, who said in the letter that she has 
been interested in securing a place on the union's list of preferred providers. 
</P>
<P>
Although members of the union -- the county's largest -- are free to pick the 
optometrist of their choice, the seven eye-care specialists currently on the 
union's provider list have agreed to charge union members no more than $100 for 
each examination and eyeglass fitting. 
</P>
<P>
In return for the guaranteed low rate, the optometrists are given exclusive 
advertising access to the membership through a personal letter of endorsement 
sent out each year by Vandeveld. 
</P>
<P>
To evaluate whether to place Wells on the list, the union sent optometrist 
Marvin Weitzman to her Allied Gardens office for an interview on Dec. 29, she 
wrote. Weitzman is on the union's preferred providers list and has been asked 
to do the screening of his colleagues for the labor union. 
</P>
<P>
After telling Wells that she would receive $100 per examination, Weitzman 
allegedly told her that optometrists on the list have no written contract with 
the union and work on the basis of an "oral agreement." 
</P>
<P>
"He then told me that once a year, someone from the union would be calling me 
to request that I make a donation of $500 to a group of the union's choice in 
my name," Wells wrote in a letter obtained by The Times. "He said that although 
it was a request, it was something that you were expected to do in exchange for 
the business of over 90% of all grocery store workers." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wells wrote, Weitzman said she would have to pay him to learn how 
to fill out one of the three forms needed for union reimbursement. "He told me 
he charged $150 to teach me how to do this, as he would be giving his own free 
time to teach me," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that to "ensure quality control of the lenses," that all optical 
orders for the retail clerks should be made through his lab, Sports Arena 
Optical, she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Wells, who was not placed on the list of providers, on Monday declined to 
comment on her letter, including why she waited two months to write about the 
incident. But two officials from the California Optometric Assn. called the 
alleged arrangement improper. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, it's intimidation," said Allan Freid, an administrator of the 
Southern California College of Optometry in Fullerton and chairman of the trade 
association's legislative committee. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my belief that it's a kick-back scheme," he said. "The health care plans 
are supposed to be in the business of providing health care to people and I 
don't see how that's related to 'donations' to anyone else, whether it is a 
legislator or Goodwill or whatever . . . This thing does not sound kosher." 
</P>
<P>
Richard H. Kendall, director of governmental affairs for the association, 
added: "I would think that would be improper." Kendall said the group has 
referred the matter to its legal counsel to see if any laws were broken. 
</P>
<P>
Ollinger of the state optometry board said that the agency has the authority to 
take a range of disciplinary action, including the suspension of licenses, if 
an investigation demonstrates that kickbacks were solicited or paid in exchange 
for the union business. 
</P>
<P>
Weitzman declined to return repeated telephone calls to his Rosecrans Street 
offices on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
One of the optometrists who gave $500, Jay Kovtun of La Mesa, said Monday that 
he decided to contribute to Vandeveld for Assembly at the suggestion of 
Weitzman and another optometrist. 
</P>
<P>
"They suggested it was a good thing to do, that he was good for optometry. I've 
been (servicing) the union for 10 years now. This is the first time I've ever 
contributed . . . This is the first time I've ever given to a campaign," said 
Kovtun. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Kovtun's wife -- optometrist L.H. Peters -- is shown on Vandeveld 
campaign statements as having given two $500 contributions through separate 
offices she maintains with other optometrists in Chula Vista and on University 
Avenue. One of the contributions was shared with her business partner in the 
University Avenue office, A. Sarantinos. Reached at home, Peters said she is 
semi-retired and was not aware of the contributions made through her 
businesses. Sarantinos could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
According to campaign records, other Vandeveld contributions from optometrists 
came from: Weitzman; R.E. Thomas of Chula Vista; Matthew Gentile of Oceanside; 
and David W. Hubbard of Escondido. All are on the preferred providers list. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard said Monday that he gave the money because he felt Vandeveld was the 
"best candidate" in the race. He declined to say whether his donation was 
solicited. Hubbard added, however, that his contribution was "absolutely not" 
made in exchange for union referrals. 
</P>
<P>
Gentile could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said Friday that his donation was not directly solicited by the union, 
whose members he has been servicing for 20 years. "No, they did not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the elder Vandeveld said Monday that he did solicit the optometrists and 55 
other health care professions on the union's preferred providers lists to help 
in underwriting his son's Democratic Assembly campaign against incumbent Steve 
Peace (D-La Mesa). 
</P>
<P>
In fact, most of the $20,150 received by his son came from other retail clerks' 
unions, in Washington and throughout the state, at his request, Vandeveld said. 
</P>
<P>
Vandeveld and his executive assistant, David Didier, said Monday that the San 
Diego-based local often calls upon its health care providers, bankers, 
attorneys and other contractors to chip in for political donations to the labor 
political action committees or fund-raisers for leukemia research. In 1988, for 
example, Vandeveld said he sent out a letter asking health care providers to 
dig into their wallets for a golf tournament that raised more than $10,000 for 
leukemia research. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, however, Vandeveld said he issued a special written appeal to 
optometrists and 55 other preferred health care professionals to raise money 
for his 29-year-old son's campaign. The Oct. 12 fund-raising appeal was sent on 
UFCW stationery after the executive board endorsed the younger Vandeveld. 
</P>
<P>
"I deeply appreciate your loyalty and good service to the 15,000 members of the 
UFCW Local 135 and their families through the years," the letter from Vandeveld 
said. "You always have been very supportive of our union and its various 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I am now writing you to make a very special request -- a personal favor -- 
that you make a political contribution to the campaign of my son, Darrel 
Vandeveld, who is a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the California 
Assembly seat in the 80th District," it said. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I truly believe in Darrel's candidacy, not only because he is my son, 
but because I believe he will make an outstanding legislator," the letter says. 
"Please send your contribution as soon as possible. You will be participating 
in a noble cause, and Darrel and I will be very grateful." 
</P>
<P>
The elder Vandeveld said Monday that he did not view his request to health care 
providers as intimidation, adding that he has not done anything to jeopardize 
the status of providers who declined to contribute. Beside the San Diego-based 
optometrists, Vandeveld's campaign received a $1,500 donation from an eye-care 
office in Canoga Park, and two $1,000 donations from San Diego dentists, public 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you how the hell they felt, but I didn't intend for them to feel 
strong-armed and there aren't any who indicated to me that they felt 
strong-armed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If they hadn't provided a contribution, they were still providing services. I 
haven't changed the (preferred provider) program from what it has been." 
</P>
<P>
His son credited the mailing for a number of $500 checks from optometrists that 
he received in the mail to his home in late October. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's wonderful," said the Democratic hopeful, an attorney in the San 
Diego office of Musick, Peler &amp; Garrett law firm. 
</P>
<P>
"As a challenger to an incumbent, no special interest group is going to 
contribute money because they pride themselves on what they call 'smart giving' 
-- giving to the candidate that they think has the best chance of winning. It 
is a purely pragmatic decision. They couldn't care less about the candidate's 
public policy views. What they hope to gain is some favor by giving money." 
</P>
<P>
Asked, however, if the optometrists knew anything about his public policy 
views, Vandeveld said, "I'm sure they don't. I've never talked to them." 
</P>
<P>
Both the elder Vandeveld and his union assistant said Monday they know of no 
informal agreement under which optometrists or other health care providers 
agree to make $500 donations each year to a cause or candidate selected by the 
labor group. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the allegations against Weitzman, Didier said: "If he in any way 
hinted, suggested or anything else that it is a mandatory contribution, that's 
ridiculous. He obviously knows better . . . but I find it hard to believe."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY LOSES ROUND ON PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley lost a round Monday in his struggle to keep off 
the June ballot a proposed City Charter amendment that would give the City 
Council new powers. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would give the council authority to override decisions by seven 
powerful and somewhat independent commissions appointed by the mayor, including 
panels that oversee the harbor and airports. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has called the proposed amendment "a dangerous intrusion into the power 
of the city's citizen-controlled commissions" and he refused last week to sign 
the ordinance asking the county to place it on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The City Clerk's Office, however, had already sent the measure, plus four other 
ballot measures, to the county on March 7. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the mayor's position Monday, Claude Hilker, an assistant city 
attorney, said that the proposal could still be placed on the ballot unless 
Bradley actually attempts to veto it.

CITY TO EXPLORE PLAN TO SAVE AZTEC BREWERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Offering preservationists one last chance to save Barrio Logan's Aztec Brewery 
buildings, the San Diego City Council agreed Monday to explore a last-minute 
redevelopment proposal for the two structures before letting them fall to the 
wrecking ball. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 6-0 to hold a public hearing on an offer made Monday by Foote 
Development Inc. to explore rehabilitation of the buildings, at 2301 Main St., 
before allowing their demolition. Foote is converting the historic Mission 
Brewery into office space. 
</P>
<P>
But in simultaneously approving demolition of the buildings, the council made 
it clear that if the Foote or other proposals prove unworkable, the brick 
buildings now scheduled to be replaced by warehouses could come down as early 
as May 15. 
</P>
<P>
The council also agreed to temporarily display the striking murals that have 
been removed from the brewery rathskeller in a nearby building, adjacent to 
Chuey's Cafe Numero Uno, before finally relocating them to the proposed Mercado 
Del Barrio redevelopment project along Crosby Street. City staff members have 
negotiated a three-year lease for display of the artworks. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no perfect solutions to this," said Councilman Bob Filner, who 
represents the 8th District, where the brewery is located. "Everybody is right. 
It is a matter of judgment how to work out the competing priorities." 
</P>
<P>
But community groups working to save the buildings, built in 1911 and 1915, 
noted that Foote had asked for 90 days to explore rehabilitation of the site, 
and threatened to again sue the city to save the structures. 
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to hang the demolition permit over everybody's head and then 
say, 'try to negotiate under these conditions,' " said Denise Ducheny, attorney 
for Harborview Community Council, which wants to preserve the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is the way the city is going to steward its cultural resources, 
they've got a problem," said Vonn Marie May, a member of the city Historical 
Site Board, which declared the buildings and the murals to be historic. "This 
is a site of major opportunity, and they're just flushing it." 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Filner said that Foote Vice President Dennis Meehan had agreed to a 
60-day study period for the redevelopment proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Debate about the brewery's future erupted two years ago, when it became known 
that a group of barrio artists had discovered murals and paintings created in 
the 1930s by the late Spanish painter Jose Moya del Pino. 
</P>
<P>
Long forgotten in the brewery's rathskeller, the murals blocked owner Northern 
Automotive Corp.'s plan to sell the two-block parcel to Ramser Development Co., 
which intended to demolish the buildings and four adjacent structures to make 
way for 120,000 square feet of warehouse space. 
</P>
<P>
The Historical Site Board in May, 1988, declared both the murals and the 
buildings historic. That June, the council upheld the designation for the 
murals, but rejected the designation for the buildings.

VIDEO STORE OWNER CONVICTED OF ARSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of a Kearny Mesa video store that was torched Nov. 8 was found guilty 
Monday of arson in the fire, which caused $135,000 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Phuc Van, 22, of San Diego hung his head after hearing the verdict. 
Superior Court Judge Milton Milkes set sentencing for April 9. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys said Van faces up to 12 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
An accomplice who was burned in the fire, Dung Diep, 21, of Oxnard, pleaded 
guilty Dec. 14 to arson and will be sentenced March 21. 
</P>
<P>
Diep testified in Van's trial, telling the jury he was to be paid $2,500 for 
setting the fire at the VP Video Store on Mesa College Drive.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAW REQUIRES DEVELOPERS TO PROVIDE PARKLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Culver City Council has adopted a law requiring developers of residential 
units to provide the city with three acres of parkland for every 1,000 
residents their project would house. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 2 last week, with Councilmen Jim Boulgarides and Steven 
Gourley dissenting, to approve the ordinance, designed to address an increasing 
shortage of park and recreation facilities in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Developers would be allowed to either dedicate the required amount of land for 
public recreation use or pay a fee. The law also allows the council to grant up 
to a 50% credit toward the requirement for proposed private open space and 
recreation facilities within the project.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN DE KAMP SAYS HE OPPOSES EAST L.A. 
PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorney general and Democratic candidate for governor John K. Van de Kamp 
announced his opposition Monday to a proposed state prison in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged a "desperate" need for more prison cells in California, but 
said a November bond issue he is seeking would finance cheaper "drug prisons" 
in the desert areas of the state and avert the need for a new and controversial 
urban prison here. 
</P>
<P>
"I promise you this," Van de Kamp told a group at Lincoln Park's Plaza de la 
Raza, "If the East L.A. prison is still on the drawing board when I become 
governor, it will never get off the drawing board."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 ARMENIAN TEEN-AGERS HELD IN RACIAL 
INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale police said Monday they have arrested two Armenian teen-agers in 
connection with racial slurs and vandalism directed at black and Korean 
residents last month. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the case stood in contrast to last year's trend, in which six 
of the eight hate crimes recorded in Glendale in 1989 were directed at the 
city's growing Armenian community. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Christopher S. Loop said that in the most recent incidents, the youths, 
both 17, are suspected of shouting a racial epithet and hurling a beer can at a 
black man and woman whose car was stopped at Brand Boulevard and Glenoaks Drive 
on Feb. 6. The youths also are accused of spray-painting Nazi symbols and 
racial slurs Feb. 1 on the walls of the predominantly Korean Glendale Calvary 
Presbyterian Church on Kenneth Road. 
</P>
<P>
Loop said investigators would seek charges of racially motivated vandalism and 
violation of civil rights against the teens.

ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Harvey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inspired by an Illinois legislator who recently held a "There Oughta Be a Law" 
contest to encourage new legislation, Assemblyman Dick Floyd (D-Carson) has 
come up with a "There Ought Not Be a Law" competition. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd is promising a free trip to Sacramento to whoever finds the silliest 
state law on the books. "We need less, not more laws," the law(un)maker said. 
</P>
<P>
Just to get the ball rolling, he's introduced a bill to abolish Section 11450 
of the state Penal Code, which outlaws marathon dances, not to mention any 
human endurance in "sliding, gliding, rolling or crawling." The bill will be 
amended to include the winning silly-law entry. 
</P>
<P>
There's more undoing to do too. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Jeff Ruch notes that ancient provisions of the state Penal Code 
still: 
</P>
<P>
* Outlaw the wearing of false whiskers. 
</P>
<P>
* Require a clean, straw mattress for prison inmates. 
</P>
<P>
* Forbid destruction of any bird nests in a cemetery -- "other than swallows' 
nests." 
</P>
<P>
No one knows why swallows were excepted. Unless it was to punish any feathered 
miscreants that failed to nest at San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
The mention here recently of the movement to create an Elvis Presley postage 
stamp brings to mind another worthy subject that has also been neglected by the 
U.S. Postal Service: 
</P>
<P>
L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly enough, no stamp has ever paid tribute to the sights of the Freeway 
City. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco has five such stamps. Oakland can take pride in the Bay Bridge 
stamp. Even San Diego has been honored. 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, numerous categories in which it would qualify. 
</P>
<P>
For architectural marvels, consider the Triforium, the giant jukebox with the 
flashing lights in the Fletcher Bowron Mall downtown; the seminal four-level 
freeway stack, also downtown; the tamale-shaped cafe in East L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Many important battles are memorialized on stamps. But nary a mention of the 
1845 Battle of Cahuenga, in which the armies of Manuel Micheltorena and Pio 
Pico blazed away at each other for hours, with the total casualties amounting 
to one horse. The two generals, it must be noted, did receive significant 
consolation: Both have surface streets, diplomatically non-intersecting, named 
after them. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service has honored many great aviation feats. But it has stubbornly 
overlooked the July 2, 1982, voyage of Larry Walters, who dismayed the Federal 
Aviation Administration by ascending 16,000 feet above Long Beach in an 
aluminum lawn chair hoisted by weather balloons. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, officials were unable to find any laws against manned lawn-chair 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, for Walters, he wasn't wearing false whiskers at the time, saving 
him from the straw mattress torture at a state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California hadn't had a "first" for a couple of weeks, but the drought 
ended Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Compton Fire Department announced that it will become the first fire 
department in the nation to go all-water bed. That's right: Springs and 
mattresses are out in the firehouse. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief Monroe Smith said the beds, donated by the water bed industry, will 
be part of a survey to study their effect on firefighters' stress and sleep. 
</P>
<P>
This could be the biggest break for the industry since an episode of David 
Horowitz' "Fight Back" show featured an elephant standing on a water bed. The 
animal didn't go to sleep, but the bed didn't break. 
</P>
<P>
One cautionary note for firefighters: Water beds have been known to encourage 
"sliding, gliding, rolling and crawling," and in California that's against the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Just wind, baby: Was it an optical illusion or did the skies of downtown L.A. 
seem to turn silver and black Monday after Al Davis' announcement?

ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE EXPECTED TO BE TWICE AS GRAND -- AND AS GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saturday's second Ventura County St. Patrick's Day Parade promises to be twice 
as large and every bit as green as last year's event. 
</P>
<P>
The procession, starting at 11 a.m. at Main Street and Ventura Avenue in 
downtown Ventura, is expected to draw the limit of 100 entries, more than twice 
as many as the 40 attractions of last year, said parade Director Bob Pollioni. 
</P>
<P>
Pollioni said Ventura Councilman and former Mayor James L. Monahan, the grand 
marshal, will set the mood by carrying "Paddy's Pig," a green-dyed piglet, as 
the parade travels south along Main to its final destination at Ash Street. 
</P>
<P>
The porker is "only green for the day," Pollioni said, noting that its nontoxic 
coloring can easily be washed off. 
</P>
<P>
Other parade highlights will include a Blarney Castle float representing the 
King and I restaurant, whose leprechaun entry won the unofficial top prize in 
1989; the marching bands of Ventura and Buena high schools; the "Big Red 
Locomotive" of the American Legion's Forty and Eight Society; a green fire 
engine provided by the Ventura County Fire Department, and the Ventura Trolley, 
carrying mayors and other officials from throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights include Irish dancers and minstrels, equestrian groups and a 
drum and bugle corps representing the Elks lodges of Ventura and Santa Barbara 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
As it did last year, the parade will include some of the county's families of 
Irish descent marching in traditional Old Country costumes. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing another of last year's attractions, the public is invited to a 
corned beef and cabbage meal starting at noon and continuing all afternoon at 
the Elks Lodge, 11 S. Ash St. 
</P>
<P>
The meal, which will be accompanied by Irish entertainment, costs $6 in advance 
or $8 at the door. Advance tickets can be bought from parade committee members 
or by calling the lodge at 653-1430. 
</P>
<P>
Monahan, chairman of the parade committee and a longtime advocate of a St. 
Patrick's Day celebration in the county, said the event has two goals -- to 
honor the county's Irish and would-be Irish, and "to recognize the good work of 
the Elks, Rotary, Lions and other service organizations." 
</P>
<P>
He added that several service groups will have entries in the parade. 
</P>
<P>
Pollioni predicted that this year's crowd will easily exceed last year's 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll not only have a much bigger parade, but we'll be helped because this 
time around St. Patrick's Day falls on a Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
Not everybody in Ventura, however, is an all-out parade enthusiast. Kevin 
Seelos, manager of the Main Street Home Furniture Collection, which operates 
three furniture stores on Main Street, said he and his brother, Brian, the 
firm's owner, believe the event's mid-Saturday scheduling will be harmful to 
downtown retailers. JACK SEARLES

the team was expected to remain in Oxnard for summer training. 
</P>
<P>
"An agreement is imminent to return this summer," said Bob Burk, director of 
marketing for the Radisson Suite Hotel, where the Raiders stay during training. 
"Our impression is that the city is preparing the final document." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager John Tooker said Oxnard has been negotiating with the 
team for three weeks and is near an agreement. Team spokesmen were unavailable 
for comment. CAROL WATSON

TRANSIENT ARRESTED OVER THEFT OF FOOD

<P>
A hungry burglar tore through drywall to enter a catering service and the 
kitchen of a school, taking a bottle of wine, brownies and other items, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police quickly arrested Mathew May, 27, in an orchard where he lives in a tent, 
about half a mile from the site of the theft. 
</P>
<P>
May was charged with burglary, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
May broke into the Bill Esty Community Center on Las Posas Road, gaining access 
to the kitchen of a Montessori school and to the Buenaventura Catering Co., 
said Sgt. Paul Oeschle. 
</P>
<P>
Only food was taken in the Saturday burglary, Oeschle said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know how much food he consumed, but it's evident he ate several food 
items," said Oeschle, who described May as "a transient in the area who had 
done this before, so we had an idea who it was." 
</P>
<P>
Sybil Coyner, owner of the catering company, said the burglar ripped two holes 
into the building, each about 15 inches high and 2 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
"What made it interesting to us was the force that was used to get in through 
the kitchen just to eat brownies and drink wine," Coyner said. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

HORSE OWNERS MOVE AFTER WINNING FIGHT

After fighting Thousand Oaks City Hall for three years to keep Ragtime, a 
well-known miniature stallion, Patty and Richard Fairchild have moved from 
their rented house on Shady Brook Drive to the city's horse country five miles 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems crazy," said Patty Fairchild, who spent $40,000 in legal fees 
fighting to keep Ragtime at their tract house. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have rented anywhere. We just ended up here." 
</P>
<P>
She said they looked for a home in all areas of Thousand Oaks and the 
surrounding areas, but ended up renting a house on Paige Lane in the city's 
horse country. 
</P>
<P>
"The house just seemed to fit the bill," Fairchild said of the three-bedroom 
blue-and-white house. And the neighbors are already warming up to the 27-inch 
horse. 
</P>
<P>
Ragtime achieved national attention in 1987, when the city ordered the 
Fairchilds to remove the tiny horse from their property. Thousand Oaks 
officials argued that the horse violated city codes prohibiting such animals 
from being kept within 40 feet of residential dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last year, a Ventura Municipal judge ruled in favor of the 
Fairchilds, saying the miniature horse should be considered a domestic pet.

7 OFFICIALS SPENT $4,997 ON 4-DAY TRIP

<P>
Four Simi Valley City Council members and three staff members have submitted 
$4,997 in receipts for a recent trip to the annual National League of Cities 
conference in Washington, D.C., officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The money covered hotel, meals and transportation expenses for the four-day 
trip, March 3-6, Councilman Glen McAdoo said. 
</P>
<P>
The city, he said, got more than its money's worth. 
</P>
<P>
"Five thousand dollars is not bad" for seven people, McAdoo said. "That wasn't 
even enough to cover it. It cost me $800 of my own money. I had to take 
personal vacation time to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Simi Valley officials were reimbursed $23,242 for expenses incurred 
last year on various trips to Sacramento, Washington, D.C., and New Orleans, 
Deputy City Manager Bob Heitzman said. 
</P>
<P>
McAdoo said it was imperative for Simi Valley officials to attend certain 
out-of-town functions, such as the League of Cities conference, which annually 
draws hundreds of city officials from all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
He said that with the ever-growing number of special interest groups, city 
officials cannot afford to miss a chance to meet with state representatives and 
push for their fair share of federal funds and programs. CARLOS LOZANO

An Ojai bicyclist who piloted the first flight of a human-powered helicopter 
was honored Monday at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington with 
other students from the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo student group that built the 
helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Greg McNeil, 22, was unable to attend the National Aeronautic Assn. award 
ceremony because he is training for the 1992 Olympic bicycling team. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 10, McNeil and a group of other Cal Poly students set a world record 
when he hovered for 6.8 seconds in a human-powered helicopter they had 
designed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great. You're bicycling as fast as you can and then all of a sudden -- 
you're flying," McNeil said Monday of the historic flight. "I bought a plane 
ticket to go to Washington, but I canceled it because I just didn't have the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
McNeil is one of 46 men and women on the United States bicycling team vying to 
compete in the Olympics. He said he bicycles in about 100 races a year and is a 
part-time student at Cal Poly majoring in aeronautical engineering. 
</P>
<P>
"I go to school one quarter a year because of the bicycling-at this rate, I'll 
finish in 15 years," McNeil said. TRACEY KAPLAN

SCHOOL POLICY CHANGE FAVORS ADMINISTRATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a strong victory for principals and other administrators, the Los Angeles 
Board of Education on Monday night rescinded a policy that would have required 
them to go back to the classroom periodically. 
</P>
<P>
The policy requiring every administrator to teach for at least 45 hours every 
other year was aimed at easing teacher complaints that many principals and 
other managers are out of touch. 
</P>
<P>
And it would have made the Los Angeles Unified School District the first big 
school system in the nation to require administrators to return to the "front 
lines." 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday night, on the recommendation of Supt. Leonard Britton, the board 
voted 5 to 2 to rescind the never-implemented policy. 
</P>
<P>
Britton, who had been bombarded with complaints from administrators ever since 
the board adopted the back-to-the-classroom policy last May 8, told board 
members that the timing was lousy and the policy unneeded. 
</P>
<P>
Britton wrote in a memo to the board that administrators will be involved in a 
number of time-consuming activities over the next several months that will be 
"demanding of their leadership and their energies." He cited looming budget 
cuts, the district's shift to a year-round calendar and the implementation of 
programs for low achievers and for students who speak little or no English.

PANEL OKS 2ND PARK FOR OFF-LEASH DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With little debate, the city Board of Recreation and Parks Commissioners voted 
unanimously Monday to establish an off-leash dog exercise area in the Woodley 
Park area of the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters hope the additional dog run will relieve congestion at Laurel Canyon 
Park along Mulholland Drive, the only city park where dogs are allowed to run 
unleashed. 
</P>
<P>
But before dogs can run free in the Woodley Park exercise area, the City 
Council must allocate $23,000 for improvements, including $12,000 to fence in 
the three-acre site, $3,000 for a water fountain for people and a water spigot 
for dogs, and $5,000 for an irrigation system for the area. Since April, 1988, 
Laurel Canyon Park has been the site of a popular pilot program in which dogs 
are allowed to run free during certain hours. The council approved the dog park 
after a three-year controversy that began when Councilman Joel Wachs, who 
represented the area at the time, cracked down on unleashed pets in the park. 
</P>
<P>
But the park attracted dog owners from all over the San Fernando Valley, 
prompting demands by dog owners to expand the program. The board is also 
considering the creation of a similar dog run in the Riverdale area of Griffith 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
The new dog run will be in a grassy area south of the Sepulveda Basin archery 
range.

Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were investigating the shooting death of 
a man whose body was found Monday morning in a field near the Antelope Valley

The body of the unidentified man was found about 8:15 a.m. by a hunter who was 
passing through the undeveloped area off Avenue G, about 200 yards east of the 
freeway, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim had been shot in the upper body and the killing apparently took 
place several days ago, deputies said. There were no suspects, deputies said.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COURT OFFICIALS ARREST WOMAN, SEIZE PISTOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 35-year-old Los Angeles woman was arrested Monday after an X-ray machine 
detected a small-caliber handgun in her purse as she entered the Van Nuys 
Municipal Courthouse, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Denise Richburg was taken into custody without resistance at about 7:30 
a.m. after courthouse security officers found a .25-caliber semiautomatic 
pistol in her handbag, said Los Angeles County Safety Officer Kim Murray. 
</P>
<P>
Richburg told security officers she came to court to pay a traffic ticket and 
forgot to remove the weapon, said Murray. She said she began carrying the gun 
for protection after someone threatened her in a business dispute, Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
Richburg was arrested on suspicion of carrying a deadly weapon in a courthouse, 
a felony, and held in Van Nuys Jail in lieu of $5,360 bail, Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
Murray said Richburg does not have a concealed-weapons permit. She has no 
criminal record and the gun was not stolen, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The X-ray machine and a metal detector were installed in the municipal 
courthouse in response to a March, 1988, incident in which a man with a history 
of mental problems held a prosecutor hostage. The man, Jeremey Sigmond, a 
Woodland Hills chiropractor, was shot to death and a bailiff was wounded in an 
ensuing gun battle. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth time a gun has been confiscated since the courthouse opened 
13 months ago, said county Safety Police Officer Robert Reynolds.

POLICE SEEK 2 MEN IN FATAL SHOOTING OF GUARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police were looking Monday for two men in connection with the fatal 
shooting of a North Hollywood security guard and an earlier armed robbery of 
four people outside a West Hollywood nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
Charles R. Doll, 51, of Van Nuys was found with multiple gunshot wounds at 
11:45 p.m. Sunday on the top level of the three-story, open-air parking 
structure behind the Century 7 Theatres in the 12800 block of Victory 
Boulevard, Lt. Ron LaRue said. Doll died at the scene shortly after he had been 
found by theater patrons who heard the shots. 
</P>
<P>
LaRue said two men were seen running from the top level, but it wasn't clear 
what led to the shooting. Police said they had not determined whether Doll had 
unholstered his gun. 
</P>
<P>
A 1984 silver Honda Prelude found near the victim's body had been stolen about 
90 minutes earlier by two men during an armed robbery in West Hollywood, LaRue 
said. Investigators believe the men who stole the car drove it to the theater 
complex and then shot Doll during a confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no idea what the reason was for the shooting," Detective Mike Coffey 
said. "We assume the victim was doing his job, and something drew him to these 
two men. They pulled a gun and shot him." 
</P>
<P>
In the West Hollywood robbery at 10:15 p.m., a man and three women parked the 
Honda in a lot in the 7900 block of Santa Monica Boulevard and were about to 
enter a nearby nightclub when they were confronted by two armed men. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, whose names were not released, were robbed of their money and the 
car but were left uninjured, LaRue said. Police were unable to identify the 
robbers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Doll was employed by Virgill Security Services of Van Nuys, which provides 
security at the movie theater complex.

CITY COUNCIL'S PAY PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In mid-February, I wrote a letter (never published) giving my views on a 
probable ulterior motive on the part of the Los Angeles City Council members 
for promoting a pay raise for themselves. That motive was to receive a husky 
increase in their pensions, which they might be forced to live on in light of a 
popular move to limit office to two terms. 
</P>
<P>
My suspicions have been borne out considering the publication of the 
anticipated pension increases arising out of the most recent proposal to be 
placed on the June ballot (March 1). Six council elders and Mayor Tom Bradley 
would receive increases ranging from in excess of $5,000 to more than $15,000 
annually. Bradley's pension would increase from almost $60,000 to more than 
$65,000 a year in addition to the $13,336 annual pension he now receives as a 
former police officer. 
</P>
<P>
To add insult to injury, The Times editorial ("They Deserve Applause and a 
Raise") on that same day takes the position that the ballot issue should be 
passed by the voters. The Times alleges that the council members should receive 
the same compensation as Municipal Court judges. Municipal Court judges are 
highly educated people, having graduated from law school, served some time in 
the law profession and in many cases could earn equal if not more in private 
practice. Members of the City Council found their way into these prestigious 
positions either haphazardly or through rich daddies and friends. I'll wager 
that 90% of the present council members could not get a job in private practice 
other than that of lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
The council can point to absolutely nothing with pride as accomplishments that 
warrant an increase in salary. I hope the voters reject the proposition and The 
Times' endorsement.

CITY COUNCIL'S PAY PROPOSAL

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The highlights of the ethics reform package leads off with "A ban on outside 
employment for all elected officials" (March 1). 
</P>
<P>
This will be one more nail in the coffin of the citizen-elected representative. 
It is basic American competitiveness that the best income provides the best 
living. 
</P>
<P>
That to be elected to office one must give up his business or profession, has 
the certain negative effect of keeping good people from seeking office. 
</P>
<P>
Simple honesty and integrity are the foundation of good citizenship. "Ethics" 
means nothing to me. As law it is worthless. Laws are only good for punishing 
those who are egregiously dishonest and whose integrity is flawed.

DANGEROUS OLD STATE BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your March 2 editorial on seismic safety standards for state buildings 
("Shaken, but Not, Alas, Stirred") is much appreciated by those of us who have 
to work in dangerous buildings, but the statistics (400 buildings, $376-million 
bond issue, etc.) don't really reflect the realities confronting the people who 
work in such structures. 
</P>
<P>
I and most of my colleagues in the Graduate School of Education at UCLA work in 
Moore Hall, which is one of several old buildings that have been designated as 
among the dozen most dangerous buildings in the state. It is a massive, 
three-story unreinforced masonry structure that is normally occupied by close 
to 1,000 people throughout the day, every school day of the year. 
</P>
<P>
My office is on the third floor of Moore Hall. When the 5.5 Upland quake hit, I 
happened to be in a newer building only a few miles from campus and was not 
even aware that there had been an earthquake. My associates on the third floor 
of Moore Hall were so panicked by the moving and shaking that they ran for 
doorways and dove under desks. Unfortunately, such defensive tactics will not 
help us when a larger quake hits. 
</P>
<P>
University and state officials have known about the hazards of Moore Hall and 
several other old unreinforced masonry buildings on the campus for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the collapsed freeway in Oakland, the governor, state legislators, the 
regents and other public officials cannot claim ignorance concerning the 
dangers associated with working in buildings like Moore Hall. The risks have 
been well-documented, and public and private appeals for action have been made 
repeatedly. Those officials who claim that seismic upgrading or replacement is 
"too expensive" might well be advised to ponder the personal consequences of an 
earthquake that would topple just Moore Hall: Do they really want to be the 
defendants in litigation filed by the grief-stricken parents, spouses and 
children of 1,000 earthquake victims?

CITY COUNCIL'S PAY PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With so many problems facing so many people in our great city, our elected 
leaders are consumed with personal pay increases. I am sure that these leaders 
are well-qualified and, but for their great devotion to service, could secure 
better paying jobs in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you will pardon my modesty, I feel equally qualified, equally 
experienced, equally educated and equally ready to match the abilities of any 
of the present servants -- and I would feel fortunate to be able to serve at 
their present wages. 
</P>
<P>
I am also sure that there are in our great community many thousands of greatly 
qualified people who could render greater service to our people if our system 
of election were more democratic.

SHIPYARD CLOSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Long Beach City Council's assertion (March 6) that it "would cost $1.7 
billion" to shut down the naval shipyard is such arrant self-serving nonsense 
that it impugns whatever case they may have. It also reflects on the Navy, 
which doubtless had a hand in cooking the figures. 
</P>
<P>
It manifestly would be cheaper to give equitable severance compensation to 
shipyard workers than to keep them on a payroll indefinitely -- or scores of 
private companies wouldn't be doing the same thing. There goes one big piece of 
purported "cost." 
</P>
<P>
Cleaning up contaminated ground at the site is an expense confronting the 
federal government whether the shipyard closes or not. 
</P>
<P>
After that, you padlock the gate and put the equipment up for sale, and 
whatever it brings is clear profit. 
</P>
<P>
The unspecified "cost of making the property usable again" is obviously an 
outlay that is up to Long Beach if it chose to cash in on a real estate 
windfall -- not an expense to be borne by the nation's taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
If it were indeed less costly to keep the shipyard operating than to close it 
down, as is implied, the United States might bootstrap itself out of its 
current insolvency just by opening a hundred more shipyards.

<P>
On his motivations, 1981: "I'm a competitor. I always have been. I don't like 
to lose. I hate losing. I think you have to be that way, to play pro football. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
On environmentalists, 1981: "A lot of them are living out there, in nice rural 
areas, and they don't want to be disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
I don't blame them. Why should they give a damn about the guy next door, 
sitting on acres of undeveloped property that's doing nothing for him? They 
don't care what's fair. But I do." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to rumors that he might win an appointment as secretary of 
transportation, 1982: "Thank you for your flattering assumptions, all of which 
are incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
On immigration, refugees and illegal aliens, 1985: "My own grandparents were 
examples of the American immigrant dream. My grandfather, a German engineer, 
migrated to Mexico where he met and married my Mexican grandmother. They 
eventually immigrated legally to California with their children and became U.S. 
citizens. There were no welfare programs then, and they and all the other 
immigrants worked hard to pay for food, clothing and shelter." 
</P>
<P>
After flattening a 135-pound, 50-year old grandmother playing catcher during a 
softball game, 1986: "That's baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding a possible backlash against people with AIDS, 1989: "If you were to 
poll the man in the street, I think you would find the vast majority of the 
public really has no interest in the subject of AIDS, and certainly could care 
less about the public financing the needed programs that you've articulated." 
</P>
<P>
On the prospect of running in a largely Latino district, 1989: Schabarum said 
such a race would pose no problems, "being a Hispanic such as I am anyway." (He 
said his paternal grandmother was Mexican.)

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
A WALKING TIME BOMB GOES OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Robert Pacewitz, the Fullerton man accused of fatally stabbing a 
3-year-old girl, made attempts in recent months -- however confused -- to drive 
away the demons that accompanied him in his young life. The interview he gave 
with reporters last week and the picture of him that has emerged from those who 
knew him suggest that he had been a walking time bomb for a long time. His 
behavior in recent weeks became outrageous. Yet he was unable to get help, even 
though he had reached for it; and though some saw his problems and tried to 
assist, they couldn't make a difference. What a disturbing story this is of 
someone's free fall through the safety net of society. 
</P>
<P>
That the suspect ever was left in the role of baby-sitter for two children on 
March 3 is, by itself, an incredible tale. He told interviewers a story that 
realizes the darkest fears of parents: that he thought for three hours about 
killing Marcelline Onick while she slept in her room. But even before a series 
of parental handoffs left him in charge of two children for a night, he had 
been sending distress signals over a period of years. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz grew up on the fringe, moving from trailer park to cheap motel, and 
dropped out of school several times. In 1988, he was treated in a Ventura 
County psychiatric clinic but developed a drug problem. His association with a 
church group in Fullerton a year ago was another try at redemption, but it 
ended badly when he quit his job and reverted to drugs. Then his life 
completely unraveled: He allegedly stabbed his mother and her boyfriend, went 
to two facilities looking for help, then left before getting it. All before a 
3-year-old died in bed. 
</P>
<P>
His attempts at finding equilibrium may have been pitiful, but the bottom line 
is that Pacewitz didn't get the help he cried out for. It's early to say where 
the blame lies, but this much is clear now: Here's somebody who never should 
have fallen through the cracks.

LAKERS REMINDED GIMMES CAN TAKE IN 107-102 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHARLOTTE, N.C. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mychal Thompson directed the opening tip to Magic Johnson, who pivoted and 
delivered a no-look bounce pass to Byron Scott running on the left side of the 
lane for a dunk. 
</P>
<P>
Four seconds had elapsed, and the Lakers already had displayed their dominance 
over the Charlotte Hornets Monday night. Losers of 22 of their previous 24 
games, and playing without injured Rex Chapman and Dell Curry, the Hornets 
figured to be out of contention even with the Lakers leading, 2-0, with 47 
minutes 56 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers, winners of 16 of their previous 18, would soon discover that 
there are no sure things, even when the team with the NBA's best record plays 
the one with the worst. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by as many as 11 points in the first half, and still behind by four 
points with eight minutes to play, the Lakers escaped with a 107-102 victory 
before 23,901 at the Charlotte Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"We got the win, which is what we wanted," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "We had 
to work for it, but it wasn't because we weren't ready. I thought we played as 
hard as we could. Charlotte just played great." 
</P>
<P>
Not concerned with appearances this time, the Lakers said they were quite 
pleased merely to win Monday. The Lakers (47-14) needed another victory to 
remain percentage points ahead of the Detroit Pistons for the league's best 
record and extend their Pacific Division lead over Portland to four games. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you," Johnson said, "they played real well. I don't know if any other 
team could have beaten them tonight." 
</P>
<P>
As in their 10-point loss to the Pistons on Sunday night, the Hornets folded in 
the fourth quarter under defensive pressure. Detroit held Charlotte scoreless 
for the final 5:58; the Lakers held the Hornets to only one field goal in the 
first 10:03 of the fourth quarter. During that span, the Lakers built a 99-93 
lead thanks to their defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers took their first lead since the early going with 4:01 left on two 
free throws by Orlando Woolridge. Woolridge then stole the ball from Armon 
Gilliam and passed to Johnson, who passed to Thompson for an inside basket and 
a 97-93 Laker lead. 
</P>
<P>
After a Hornet timeout, Johnson stripped the ball from Randolph Keys and passed 
to Scott for a layup and a 99-93 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mugsy Bogues finally broke Charlotte's scoring drought by making a layup with 
1:57 to play, but Johnson made a drive in traffic with 1:01 to play for a 
101-95 lead and the Hornets never really threatened despite Robert Reid's 
desperation three-point basket. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers said their comeback was a far greater accomplishment than Sunday's 
eight-point victory over the Atlanta Hawks. A loss to the Hornets would have 
been a major blow to their record -- and their egos. 
</P>
<P>
James Worthy, who led the Lakers with 26 points, said that sometimes playing 
the weaker teams is more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"Teams like this or Orlando or Minnesota, you have to play even harder," Worthy 
said. "The only thing a team of this caliber has going for it is a tremendous 
effort. A team like this is dangerous. They took Detroit to the wire (Sunday) 
We had to play better than against Atlanta to win." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers made 52% of their shots, held a 42-37 rebounding advantage and 
limited Charlotte, which shot 73.7% in the second quarter, to five field goals 
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the type of game that lets us know that we have to come prepared every 
night," Woolridge said. "We didn't play defense really well the whole game. But 
we played good when we had to." 
</P>
<P>
As usually is the case, Johnson made most of the big plays for the Lakers in 
the final minutes. He had assists on three of the Lakers' last four baskets in 
the final 4:44, scoring the other himself. He also had steals on consecutive 
Hornet possessions. 
</P>
<P>
It was a strong ending to an otherwise mediocre night, by Johnson's standards. 
He made only four of 10 shots, committed four turnovers and had problems 
guarding the 5-foot-3 Bogues, who had 21 points. But Johnson finished only a 
rebound shy of another triple-double. He had 19 points, 15 assists and nine 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't perform the same Magic show every night, but he's still out there 
with his teammates, creating a lot of things other players don't," Worthy said. 
"You got to realize (Johnson) always attracts a lot of attention." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said Johnson often tries to shoulder too much of the burden when the 
Lakers struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"He begins to feel the pressure," Riley said. "But when it counted, he came up 
with the defensive and offensive plays. The whole thing at the end was just 
typical Earvin Johnson." 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson: "You get frustrated because you see easy shots -- layups -- that 
should go in, but go out. That happened to us a lot tonight. It wasn't like we 
were playing bad. And we did come back to win. As long as we stay within 
striking distance, I feel good, I feel like we can win." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Byron Scott played on consecutive nights for the first time since suffering 
reinjury of his left hamstring. He said he felt no pain. Scott also played with 
a hip pointer suffered during Sunday's victory over the Atlanta Hawks. Scott 
had 12 points Monday night. . . . Hornet guard Rex Chapman, originally thought 
to have a strained right calf, has a broken right leg and will be sidelined the 
rest of the season. . . . Dell Curry, another Hornet guard, missed the game 
because of a sprained left ankle and tendinitis.

HIGH FIBER FOR DIETERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Why are high-fiber foods recommended for someone who is on a diet? 
Don't they have calories? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: One reason high-fiber foods are recommended for dieters is that they 
fill the stomach and give the dieter the feeling that his or her appetite has 
been satisfied. This, of course, enables the dieter to control his or her 
appetite.

PEARCE GUILTY OF HIRING TWO TEEN KILLERS; 
</P>
<P>
MURDER: THE JURY WILL NOW DECIDE IF THE FORMER TEACHER'S AIDE WILL BE SENTENCED 
TO DEATH OR LIFE IN PRISON FOR THE SLAYING OF HER ESTRANGED HUSBAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Former teacher's aide Roberta Pearce was convicted Monday in Vista Superior 
Court of hiring two 15-year-old boys to murder her estranged husband so she 
could collect his life insurance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Pearce, 42, faces the death penalty or life in prison without parole because a 
jury found her guilty of first-degree murder with special circumstances and 
conspiring to commit murder in the slaying of Robert Wayne Pearce on Jan. 31, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant sat still and without expression as the verdict was read after 2 
1/2 days of jury deliberations. The dead man's mother, Rita Church, watched 
Pearce and whispered, "She's the coldest thing I ever saw in my life." 
</P>
<P>
The jury agreed with Deputy Dist. Atty. Tim Casserly that the special 
circumstances of murder for financial gain and lying in wait were present, 
therefore requiring a sentence of either death or life in state prison without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Franklin J. Mitchell told the jurors to return to his courtroom next 
Monday to begin deciding the penalty. In the meantime, he instructed jurors not 
to discuss the trial publicly or even among themselves, or to expose themselves 
to news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a previously imposed gag order, neither Casserly nor Pearce's 
defense attorneys, Brad Patton and William Fletcher, commented on the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Pearce's parents, Minnie and Herbert Meadows, darted from the courtroom after 
the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Also present for the proceedings, beside the dead man's mother, was his brother 
Jim Pearce and sister-in-law Debra Pearce, who had come from Illinois for the 
verdict. They gasped when the guilty judgment was read and somberly left the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad we got justice in the state of California," said Jim Pearce. The 
family's attorney, Dennis Atchley, advised them against further remarks because 
they have filed a civil suit against Roberta Pearce. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, the teen-agers who killed Pearce's husband testified against 
her. Isaac Hill and Anthony Pilato, now both 16, previously pleaded guilty to 
first-degree murder and were sentenced to the California Youth Authority until 
they reach age 25. 
</P>
<P>
Hill and Pilato, along with 17-year-old Mandy Gardiser who lived in Pearce's 
sprawling Valley Center ranch house for two weeks before the killing, testified 
that Pearce wanted her husband dead so that she could get a $200,000 life 
insurance premium. 
</P>
<P>
They also said under oath that Pearce, a former teacher's aide at Orange Glen 
High School in Escondido, was fearful about losing the couple's home in a 
pending divorce and having to displace her two dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Hill and Pilato testified that Pearce promised each of them $50,000 and a car 
if they'd kill her husband, who was attacked by them as he walked toward his 
pickup truck before dawn on Jan. 31 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said that as he asked Pearce for the time of day, Pilato struck him from 
behind with a carpenter's hand ax and then attacked him with a kitchen knife. 
Although the victim was hit 27 times, he managed to crawl back to his 
third-floor apartment before collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
He died in surgery at Palomar Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Taking the stand in her defense, Pearce conceded she had smoked marijuana with 
some of the teen-agers who congregated at her home. She also admitted she had 
sex with another teen-age boy, Frank (Soddy) Rodriguez, who pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy to murder for his role in the plot. 
</P>
<P>
But Pearce said that on the night and early morning of the slaying, she had 
closeted herself in her bedroom, angry at the teen-agers for having taken her 
car without permission. 
</P>
<P>
The defense argued that it was the teen-agers' own idea to kill Pearce so that 
they could continue living at the Valley Center home and because of their 
misguided belief that Roberta Pearce wanted him dead. 
</P>
<P>
Though the defense argued the statements of Hill, Pilato and Gardiser couldn't 
be trusted, the prosecution maintained the youths would have had no reason to 
kill a man they had never met -- unless they had been asked to act by Pearce in 
exchange for money and cars. 
</P>
<P>
Gardiser had testified that at 3 a.m. the day of the killing, Roberta Pearce 
admonished Hill and Pilato as they left the house, "be careful and don't get 
caught." 
</P>
<P>
When the two boys returned to the house after the deed at about 6:30 a.m., Hill 
told the court that Pearce was angry at them. "I said we had done it, we had 
killed Mr. Pearce," Hill recounted. 
</P>
<P>
"She said the hospital had called that he was alive, and they wanted her at the 
hospital," Hill continued testifying. "She was mad. She said 'he's not dead and 
you're not going to have the opportunity to do it again.' " 
</P>
<P>
Two other teen-age boys testified that they, too, had been solicited by Pearce 
to kill her husband, but that they refused. However, jurors, despite handing 
down the murder verdict, found Pearce not guilty on these two counts of 
solicitation to commit murder. 
</P>
<P>
Hill and Pilato said they fled to Tijuana after the killing, and that on Friday 
of that week they telephoned Pearce because they needed $300. They said she 
arrived later that day with the money. 
</P>
<P>
Phone records documented the collect telephone call to her house from Mexico, 
and bank records showed she withdrew $300 in cash that day. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell told jurors he expects the penalty phase to last about two days next 
week.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eastern Airlines Veto 
</P>
<P>
The House failed to override President Bush's veto of a bill (HR 1231) 
injecting the government into the dispute between Eastern Airlines and the 
striking International Assn. of Machinists. The tally was 261 to 160. 
</P>
<P>
A two-thirds majority was needed to override. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, which is backed by organized labor, a panel appointed by 
Congress was to have made non-binding recommendations on ending the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Override supporter Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.) called the bill "our last hope of

"When no transportation emergency exists . . . the President and Congress have

To Help U.S. Foundries 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 382 to 27, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 1243) setting 
up three government research centers to help the faltering metal-casting 
industry become more competitive. The new federal program would cost the 
Treasury $15 million over three years, and foundries also would fund it. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Ben Erdreich (D-Ala.) said "over half of U.S. foundries have closed 
since 1971, putting tens of thousands of Americans out of work." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) asked, "Why should the government finance 
projects for industries which do not finance them themselves?" 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to create a new program to help the metal casting 
industry.

SAGON PENN ARRESTED IN DOMESTIC-VIOLENCE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sagon Penn, twice acquitted in the 1985 slaying a police officer, was booked on 
suspicion of assault on a spouse, battery on a police officer and resisting 
arrest, officials said Monday. He was being held in County Jail in lieu of 
$17,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Cohen, a spokesman for the San Diego Police Department, said a police 
officer and a reserve officer responded to a domestic violence call about 11 
p.m. Sunday in the 3800 block of Caminito Aguilar in Clairemont. 
</P>
<P>
When they arrived, Annilie Carmichael told them she wanted a man removed from 
her apartment. Carmichael, 35, gave the man's name as Mecee Parks, but the 
policeman, John Uravish, recognized the man as Penn. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Carmichael told them that Penn had twisted her right arm, bruising 
it, and thrown her to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she was afraid for herself and her three children," Cohen said, 
adding that the children are between 3 and 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Penn, 28, was sitting on a sofa and refused to leave when Uravish asked him to, 
Cohen said, adding that Penn resisted the officer's attempt to handcuff him. 
Uravish called for assistance, and about five or six officers responded, Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Penn again refused to leave and this time stood up from the sofa and assumed a 
"martial arts fighting stance," Cohen said. A scuffle ensued, in which Uravish 
received a minor injury to a knee. 
</P>
<P>
The backup officers used a Taser gun to subdue Penn. The gun delivers barbs 
that emit electrical voltage upon striking a person, Cohen said, adding that 
the person is then "unable to do much." 
</P>
<P>
The officers then handcuffed Penn and took him out of the apartment, Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The barbs were removed at UC San Diego Medical Center and Penn was then booked 
into jail. 
</P>
<P>
Two juries acquitted Penn of the murder of San Diego Police Officer Thomas 
Riggs. He was also acquitted of wounding another officer and a civilian 
ride-along. The last trial was in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Penn pleaded guilty to misdemeanor vandalism charges after he became 
involved in an altercation with an ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend. Penn was 
ordered to undergo psychological counseling and pay $1,500 in restitution for 
the damage he did to the boyfriend's vehicle.

MORNING BRIEFING: BIG EAST MAY GET ITS CHANCE TO PUT TUBBS, SOONERS TO SLEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARLEY TINKHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oklahoma basketball Coach Billy Tubbs recently was quoted as saying that 
doctors prescribed watching Big East Conference games as a cure for insomnia. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no," Tubbs said. "What I meant to say was that on videotapes of Big East 
games, they have a disclaimer that says, 'Caution. May cause drowsiness.' " 
</P>
<P>
Not necessarily so: When 6-foot-9 Brian Williams went to the line for Arizona 
against UCLA Sunday, Channel 2's Dan Belluomini said, "Normally, big guys have 
a lot of trouble with free throws." 
</P>
<P>
Could be, but of the top nine free throwers in the NBA, four are 6-9 or taller 
-- Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Jack Sikma and Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: True or false? Lou Holtz has made appearances on the Jack Paar and 
Ed Sullivan shows. 
</P>
<P>
Flight plan: Former NHL star Derek Sanderson, a recovering alcoholic, told the 
Sporting News how he used to combat his fear of flying. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to sit in a bar at the airport and I'd have a little system all worked 
out," he said. "I'd line up seven shots of whiskey, with a glass of Coke, a 
glass of 7-Up, a stick of gum and a cigarette. I'd fire down the shots, chase 
them with the Coke and 7-Up, pop the gum in my mouth and take a big haul on the 
cigarette. I wouldn't even take a breath. 
</P>
<P>
"I had it all worked out. I knew how many drinks I had to take depending on how 
long the flight was so I'd sleep through it." 
</P>
<P>
Overmatched: When heavyweight champion Buster Douglas, a former junior college 
basketball player, showed up at the Ohio State-Illinois game in his native 
Columbus, they arranged a free-throw contest between him and ESPN's Dick 
Vitale. 
</P>
<P>
It was no contest. Vitale went 10 for 10, Douglas four for 10. 
</P>
<P>
For what it's worth: From Furman Bisher of the Atlanta Journal: "While Danny 
Ferry is moving along at a lovely pace, averaging 22 points a game, he is far 
behind scoring leaders in Italy, the Brazilian Oscar Schmidt averaging 33, and 
the former Hawk, Mike McGee, at 34." 
</P>
<P>
Numbers game: When Joe Barry Carroll went to the Denver Nuggets from the New 
Jersey Nets, he requested No. 44. He was told the number had been retired. It 
belonged to Dan Issel, whose jersey hangs from the rafters in McNichols Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Said Issel: "Tell him if he wants it, he's going to have to jump up there and 
get it." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll settled for No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: True, but it was not the Lou Holtz who coaches the football team 
at Notre Dame. This one was a New York comic who rose to popularity before 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Add Holtz: He was virtually retired at 50, living off the stock investments he 
made while a $6,000-a-week headliner at the Palace Theater in New York. He 
wasn't idle, however. When his youngest son was born, he was 72. 
</P>

raise awarded NBA Commissioner David Stern: "The head of the Colombian cartel 
doesn't make that much money." HARLEY TINKHAM

INCREASED PRESSURE TO WIN MAKES IT HARDER TO ACCEPT LOSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL GLAUBER, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Terry Truax was accustomed to winning. Work long enough with coaches such as 
Dean Smith at North Carolina and Morgan Wootten at DeMatha High School in 
suburban Washington, D.C., and victories are not only demanded, but expected. 
</P>
<P>
But this was different. 
</P>
<P>
Truax was on his own in 1985, in the midst of a second dreadful season at 
Towson State north of Baltimore. In the final seconds of a loss to Washington 
College, a forward named Greg McClinton didn't dive after a loose ball, and 
Truax became furious. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided then and there that I was going to kick this kid off the team, even 
though we had only seven healthy players," Truax said. "Another coach and a 
friend told me I couldn't do it. They were right. Greg McClinton turned out to 
be a fine young man. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'll never forget it. I just couldn't handle losing. It was my own lack of 
maturity. What I learned is that it's only when you lose that you know what 
it's like to be a coach." 
</P>
<P>
Losing is an inescapable constant of college basketball, which moves into a 
second season Sunday with the selection of 64 teams for the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association Division I tournament. Coaches may tire of recruiting, the 
media and the alumni, but they abhor defeat. A loss puts a coach one step 
closer to the unemployment line. Fifty-four Division I schools hired new 
basketball coaches this season. Want to bet the list will grow longer by next 
season? 
</P>
<P>
"When a coach loses, it's like a cataract over his eye," said 
coach-turned-sportscaster Al McGuire. "A losing coach is in the twilight zone." 
</P>
<P>
You hear the tales of rage. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue's Gene Keady slamming his fist on a blackboard after a loss. St. 
Joseph's Jim Boyle furious, unable to utter a word after his team gives away a 
game. Massachusetts' John Calipari ripping his sports coat and shirt in a rage. 
</P>
<P>
Losing also takes its toll physically. Truax gains weight during the season. 
Calipari's voice is constantly hoarse. Ulcers are part of the package. After he 
was fired as Loyola College of Maryland's coach last season, Mark Amatucci took 
a look in the mirror and was frightened by the reflection. There were dark 
circles under his eyes and his skin was pasty. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize in how bad a shape I was," said Amatucci, who now coaches at 
Anne Arundel Community College in Maryland. "When you lose, you question 
whether you did enough, and that just leads to a lot of sleepless nights. Then 
you start piling on the outside influences and pressures, and that drives you 
to the brink of breakdown." 
</P>
<P>
So, how do college basketball coaches handle losing? 
</P>
<P>
There are no facts or quick solutions or soothing potions to heal the coaches. 
This is a story of emotions, of men trying to deal with the essential element 
of competitive sports, that for every winner, there is a loser. Somehow, in a 
world of billion-dollar television contracts, March Madness and sneaker deals, 
the law of nature has been forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"Win, win, win," said Shelby Metcalf, the Texas A&amp;M coach who feuded with 
his athletic director and was fired this year after 26 1/2 seasons and a 
438-306 record. "I used to take an Aggie fishing, and he didn't know if he had 
had a good time or not until he got to shore and counted the fish. That's 
wrong. When Dr. Naismith put up that basket, he didn't mean for it to be so 
bottom-line oriented. Heck, I was just having a ball all those years. Wasn't 
anyone else?" 
</P>
<P>
John Wooden never wanted to see a player cry after a game. When he was a senior 
guard at Martinsville High School in Indiana, his team lost the 1928 Indiana 
State Championship to Muncie, 13-12. In the locker room, some of his teammates 
wept. 
</P>
<P>
"We had played well, and we had lost," Wooden said. "Down deep, I was critical 
of my teammates for crying. I was able to accept these things better than 
most." 
</P>
<P>
Winning nine NCAA titles at UCLA and compiling an 88-game winning streak 
enabled Wooden to accept defeats. He was not always a gracious loser, but his 
rhetoric was proper, and his approach, at least in theory, served as a model. 
</P>
<P>
"When we failed in execution, that was me, because I failed to teach the 
players," he said. "The only time to get upset was when we didn't properly 
prepare. Coaches have to accept the fact that they are going to lose. You're 
not perfect. You'll make mistakes. But you can't cry about it." 
</P>
<P>
Sports psychologists preach honesty and perspective in dealing with emotions. 
But they recognize the limits of their prescription in a society that glorifies 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
"The more emphasis we put on winning, the more difficult it is to deal with 
losing," said Dr. Thomas Tutko, a sports psychologist at San Jose State. "The 
athlete can still get an education, but the coach's livelihood, his bread and 
butter, is on the line. The modern athlete is probably less concerned about 
winning or losing than the coach is." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Cylkowski, a performance counselor and sports psychologist based in 
Minneapolis, said winning becomes a way of life for coaches. Losing can damage 
a coach's ego, or worse. 
</P>
<P>
"In coaching, you're just a piece of a puzzle," he said. "Your ego has to come 
down a bit. There is no perfection in sports." 
</P>
<P>
Winning wasn't always a matter of career life or death. Once upon a time, teams 
played non-conference games to prepare for the "regular" season. Losses were 
part of the building process. 
</P>
<P>
That was before wall-to-wall basketball on television. 
</P>
<P>
"There was much less pressure," said Pete Newell, who guided California to the 
1959 NCAA title. "Now, with the TV and money, there is so much attached to 
getting to the Final Four. So many things that are wrong relate to money and 
what it can bring people." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Vitale, Billy Packer and McGuire used their roles as television analysts 
to put the coaches on the marquee and create college basketball's cult of 
personality. Coaches can now extract six-figure contracts from universities, 
but they are subjected to instant televised critiques. 
</P>
<P>
"Coaches weren't targets in the old days," Newell said. "Your moves weren't 
always analyzed. But all that has changed because of television." 
</P>
<P>
But the analysts sympathize with the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I was spoiled and hated losing," said Vitale, who coached at the University of 
Detroit and the Detroit Pistons. "You go to church on a Sunday and everyone 
looks at you, and they know if you were a success or failure the night before. 
If the ball hits nothing but net, you're a god. If it hits a rim, you're a 
bum." 
</P>
<P>
Vitale said coaches such as Dale Brown, Digger Phelps, Tom Davis, Lute Olson 
and P.J. Carlesimo handle losing well, "because they are able to come back 
positively the next day instead of yelling and screaming. A lot of guys who 
lose, they lose their self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
Keady, Gary Williams, Jim Boeheim and Bob Knight are among those who have 
difficulty accepting defeat, according to Vitale. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys who are emotional and show their intensity feel they're being scrutinized 
after a loss," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Packer said coaches have a right to feel they're being judged after losses. 
</P>
<P>
"No one in a high-profile program deals with losing well," he said. "They 
realize each and every loss puts them closer to not having a job." 
</P>
<P>
McGuire, who spent most of his career at Marquette, has become increasingly 
disenchanted with the motivations of the current coaching generation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that fear of losing is bringing down these guys," he said. "I 
think it's the money. When I was coaching, to be in the country club was your 
dream. Today, these guys are bigger than all the members of the country club. 
That's where the pressure comes from. You're living on a level with the nice 
threads, the cars, the stockbrokers. The fear of returning as an assistant 
coach, or selling socks or insurance, affects these guys." 
</P>
<P>
Losing brings out the rawest emotion in college basketball. The coach is caught 
on a stage, gesturing, screaming, the spiritual and intellectual center of a 
team. He must deal with defeat, both publicly and privately. 
</P>
<P>
At Maryland, Williams oversees a young team that is adjusting to his system. 
Graying, taut and tense, Williams is a 40-minute soap opera come to life, each 
missed basket or blown defensive assignment registering on his face. After a 
loss comes a transformation. Composed. Regal. A gentleman who shakes hands, 
walks across the court, slips on a set of headphones and eloquently discusses 
the game for a radio audience and the crowd at Cole Field House. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned that you don't have a choice in the way you handle losing," 
Williams said. "You have to be rational. You can't always say how you feel. 
Sometimes, before games, I try to make sure I have my thoughts in order. 
Sometimes, in a close loss, you're in a little bit of shock. I don't like to 
lose. I can handle it. But I'm not a miracle worker." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Schneider of Loyola College dresses like a physics professor in a tweed 
jacket and gray slacks. Relaxed, hands clapping instinctively after good plays 
and bad, Schneider realizes screaming won't transform Loyola. Only patience and 
recruiting can put the Greyhounds into the fast lane. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to temper your intensity," he said. "When I was a lot younger, I once 
walked into a pregame meal and got all over the team because they were joking 
and laughing. The next time I walked in for a meal, the kids were quiet, and I 
yelled at them for being too tight. I was internalizing everything." 
</P>
<P>
Towson State's Truax often paces absent-mindedly onto the floor, his face 
turning bright pink, a program rolled in his right hand. After a loss, he talks 
quietly, analyzing every fragment of the game. He does not sleep peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
"You take the losses home with you," he said. "You try not to, but you're up at 
2, 3, 4 in the morning looking at films. Losing is frustrating, but you can't 
get down." 
</P>
<P>
You want to know how to lose? Check the guys who have been around, who can walk 
away from the losses with class, dignity and fire. 
</P>
<P>
Look at Paul Westhead at Loyola Marymount. After his team lost in overtime at 
Louisiana State, Westhead walked to the other bench, shook hands with LSU's 
Brown and left. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no sense treating losing like it's World War III," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Look at Jim Phelan at Mount St. Mary's, a small, private school, just going up 
the Division I elevator. But after 36 years and more than 600 victories and 300 
losses, Phelan manages to keep the game in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't take any of this personally," he said. "When I was just getting 
started as a coach, the student body was hanging me in effigy. You can't start 
taking blame for losses, because, all of a sudden, you'll go crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Look at Butch van Breda Kolf, a grandfather who curses referees and molds teams 
at Hofstra. The only time he couldn't take losing, he quit a job with Detroit 
in the National Basketball Association. 
</P>
<P>
"We all get too wrapped up in this winning and records," he said. "When you 
forget about whys and only think about results, you get burned out in your 
40s." 
</P>

And finally, look at Lefty Driesell, one of the game's ultimate survivors. 
Whether at Davidson, Maryland or his current address, James Madison, it's all 
big-time to him.

"I've always hated to lose," he said. "But if you won all the time, it wouldn't 
be fun. Losing is what makes coaching interesting."

AN ONGOING BATTLE OVER FISH INSPECTION 
</P>

<P>
In the latest twist of the convoluted turf battle over fish inspection, the 
Food and Drug Administration and the National Marine Fisheries Service -- 
backed by the Bush administration -- are proposing to strengthen the present 
voluntary fish inspection program, with industry picking up the tab. 
</P>
<P>
FDA and NMFS are already getting criticism from consumer groups and industry, 
who in a rare meeting of the minds, have been jointly fighting for mandatory 
fish inspection. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is also making waves in Congress, where there are nine bills pending 
for mandatory legislation, and in the Agriculture Department, which had hoped 
for a piece of the action. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike meat and poultry, seafood is the only flesh food not under 
comprehensive, mandatory federal oversight for wholesomeness and safety. Two 
agencies provide a patchwork of seafood protection: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A voluntary National Marine Fisheries Service inspection program affected 
approximately 11 percent of the total seafood consumed in the country last year 
and 7 percent of the processors. The program, which processors pay for, focuses 
primarily on quality and appearance of seafood, not safety. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Food and Drug Administration visits the nation's more than 4,000 
seafood processors and wholesalers approximately once every four years, 
conducts lab analyses for the presence of contaminants, and maintains a 
shellfish safety program with the states in which there have been repeated 
instances of nonconformity. 
</P>
<P>
Neither NMFS nor FDA certifies boats, while efforts to monitor imports are 
spotty and there is widespread agreement that shellfish harvesting regulations 
need to be better enforced. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new NMFS-FDA plan, vessel owners, processors and distributors who 
choose to pay the government for inspection services could opt for a more 
safety-oriented regime, known as Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the traditional meat-and-poultry inspection system where an 
inspector is continuously on hand checking all facets of an operation, under a 
HACCP system, only those points where contamination is most likely to occur are 
monitored. 
</P>
<P>
The system -- which checks everything from the maximum time fish can remain on 
a loading dock to the temperature of the room where filleting is being done to 
the length of time that breaded shrimp are chilled after cooking -- has been 
broadly supported. 
</P>
<P>
Visual and hands-on inspection is largely viewed as antiquated and generally 
inadequate at spotting the invisible bacteria that can lead to food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
The seafood industry, which has been working for several years on developing 
the standards and methods for HACCP, supports the approach. It is concerned, 
however, that the two agencies are plunging ahead with an incomplete program 
that raises more questions than it answers, and that it may become a substitute 
for a mandatory program instead of an interim solution. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the voluntary nature of the program defeats the purpose of HACCP, 
which is designed to monitor all the critical points of the fish as they travel 
from the water to the table, according to Richard Gutting, vice president of 
government relations of the National Fisheries Institute, the trade group 
representing the fishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Billy, director of NMFS's Office of Trade and Industry Services, said it 
is hoped that the plan would have a trickle-down effect; a wholesaler who chose 
to participate would only purchase fish from a participating processor who 
would buy only from an HACCP-inspected boat. 
</P>
<P>
As for questions that remain, Billy admitted that the plan is "still in the 
formative stage" and that "it's not like we have all the answers. We're really 
looking for public input." 
</P>
<P>
They're already getting it. "The idea is a bunch of hogwash," said Rep. Gerry 
Studds, D-Mass., whose district includes the major fishing port of New Bedford. 
"While we're working here diligently to get (mandatory) legislation through, 
FDA and Fisheries talk about a voluntary system that is unacceptable to 
virtually everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Billy of NMFS disagrees. "Since we have begun to talk about the idea, we've 
gotten some very favorable responses from a number of people in the seafood 
industry that believe it is important that we get started now while we wait to 
see what, if any legislation gets passed." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some industry, consumer and Congressional staffers view the FDA 
and NMFS proposal as a power grab and a way to end run more comprehensive 
legislation. In five of the nine bills pending in Congress, the Department of 
Agriculture is designated as the responsible agency. 
</P>
<P>
FDA and NMFS "are the two agencies which stand to lose authority under some of 
the legislative proposals," said Gutting of NFI, which would like USDA to be in 
charge of fish inspection. "We know that they not only very much want to retain 
their authority but also increase it. It's not surprising that some people have 
concluded that this is an effort to cut off more comprehensive legislation, but 
the agencies, to be fair, have not told us those are their intentions." 
</P>
<P>
Derailing legislation, said NMFS' Billy, "is not the intent at all." 
</P>
<P>
An FDA official added that "it's more of a power grab for USDA. The program is 
ours today. There's nothing wrong with it except that it's a little anemic." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, even though Billy believes that in the current budget climate, 
user fees may be the only way to fund such a program, skeptics of the plan 
object to industry paying for its own regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"Inspection of food is a public purpose function and should be paid for under 
the treasury of the United States because people's health and safety are 
involved," said Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan. "We don't have user fees for meat and 
poultry. You're talking about public health. And this is the biggest public 
health issue that Congress will have to face this year." 
</P>
<P>
Just how much of a public health risk seafood poses is difficult to ascertain 
as seafood-associated disease data are largely recognized to be incomplete. 
While federal officials do not believe consumers face a serious health problem 
from eating seafood, they do believe there is some risk posed by a limited 
number of species -- primarily raw molluskan shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the health implications, the new plan touches a sensitive chord in 
the Bush administration's indecision about which agency should be given 
responsibility for fish inspection. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a number of meetings were held between the administration and the 
agencies involved, but the administration declined to take a position, instead 
deferring to Congress to make the decision. 
</P>
<P>
An administration official who was involved in the meetings admits that "it 
would have been a lot neater" if the White House had favored an agency to take 
charge. "The bottom line is that the agencies had their own strong personal 
views and desires and it was not felt that a compromise was possible. It was 
not a big enough matter to go to the president, and have him say 'one of you 
wins and other two lose,' " the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, more recently, $14 million earmarked for improving fish inspection showed 
up in the administration's 1991 Budget. According to Billy of NMFS, the 
Fisheries Service and FDA proposed a mandatory scheme (with user fees) to 
budget officials at the Office of Management and Budget, who declined to 
provide the $90 million to start up the program. NMFS and FDA then came up with 
the idea of strengthening the present voluntary program. 
</P>
<P>
Yet to some wishful observers, policy officials in the administration are still 
undecided about fish inspection, even though budget officials have already 
designated additional money for FDA and NMFS for a voluntary program. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Agriculture Clayton Yeutter, who from the start has been lobbying 
for USDA to take over the responsibility, is reportedly not pleased with the 
current proposal. In speaking to reporters recently, Yeutter said, "I still 
think it would be a good idea and I still think it (USDA) is a proper place to 
have that kind of program, but obviously any official pronouncements on that 
subject must be reflective of an administration consensus and to my knowledge, 
that consensus has not yet emerged." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, White House deputy press secretary Alixe Glen said the 
administration does support the new FDA-NMFS plan.

KINGS DEAL NICHOLLS MORE GRIEF BY BEATING RANGERS, 6-2; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: STILL BITTER OVER TRADE, HE'S UNIMPRESSIVE AGAINST FORMER TEAMMATES. 
</P>

<P>
Bernie Nicholls still hasn't been able to put the demons to rest. They kept him 
awake long into the night Sunday, fanning the flames of bitterness he still 
feels over his trade from the Kings to the New York Rangers nearly two months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
When he was swapped for Tomas Sandstrom and Tony Granato, Nicholls called it a 
dumb deal. He has certainly been vindicated by the results thus far. The 
Rangers have moved from fourth into first in the Patrick Division, while the 
Kings, with either Sandstrom or Granato injured much of the time, have gone 
nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
But with the Kings coming to Madison Square Garden Monday, another chance for 
vindication was at hand and Nicholls tossed and turned until dawn at the 
prospect. 
</P>
<P>
He might as well have stayed in bed. Vindication belonged to Sandstrom and 
Granato as they teamed to lead the Kings to a 6-2 victory before a disappointed 
sellout crowd of 16,651. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking about this game all night," Nicholls said. "I thought I had 
talked myself out of being nervous, but, obviously, I hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt good coming in, real calm. But once the game got going, I started to 
get real nervous and uptight. I didn't play well at all. I had no legs. I felt 
like I had already played a game. No way I should be that tired. It was just 
nervousness. I was mentally drained. I wanted to do well. Any time you play 
against your former teammates, you want to do well." 
</P>
<P>
That's just the way Sandstrom and Granato felt. 
</P>
<P>
They played on the same line Monday for the first time since they teamed last 
year with the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, the two wings had a bonus -- Wayne Gretzky between them. The 
result was a goal and two assists for Granato, and a goal and an assist for 
Sandstrom. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice to come out of here with a win," Granato said, "but it's not like 
we came in here trying to prove they made a bad trade. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough day, a lot of excitement. Basically, I was thinking, let's 
hurry and get the game over with. It was weird. There are a lot of good 
memories here." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the memories intruded into reality. After being whistled for a 
penalty, Granato skated over to the Ranger penalty box before catching himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I hoped that nobody saw," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The goal was Granato's ninth of the season, but just his second as a King. He 
missed 13 of the 23 games the Kings have played since his arrival because of a 
groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
A week after Granato returned, Sandstrom went out with a facial fracture and 
scratched cornea, the result of a punch thrown in the brawl with the Edmonton 
Oilers. Sandstrom missed five games before returning Monday and scoring his 
28th goal, and ninth since the trade. 
</P>
<P>
Sandstrom, the right side of his face still numb, wore a protective facemask 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt pretty safe behind it," he said, "but I feel kind of awkward with it." 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers looked awkward all night, despite the fact they are 32-27-12, lead 
the second-place New Jersey Devils by eight points, had won five consecutive 
games at home and were 8-1-2 over their previous 11. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers are 15-6-2 since the Nicholls trade while the Kings are 9-13-1. 
</P>
<P>
But, suddenly, with both Granato and Sandstrom back, the trade looks a little 
better. 
</P>
<P>
After losing four in a row, the Kings (30-34-6) played well Monday for the 
second straight game, coming off an 8-2 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings scored on one of three power plays Monday, with John Tonelli getting 
his 29th goal, and killed seven of eight penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls said he likes seeing his former teammates do well. At least when they 
are not across the ice. 
</P>
<P>
And he holds no grudges against owner Bruce McNall, whom he met with after the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
King Coach Tom Webster is another matter. Nicholls holds him responsible for 
the trade. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy has to prove himself in this league," Nicholls said. "I could understand 
it if it had been Al Arbour or Scotty Bowman or someone like that who had been 
around a long time. But I don't think he (Webster) knew me well enough to make 
that decision." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Nicholls afterward, Webster replied, "Next question." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The other King goals were scored by Luc Robitaille (his team-leading 46th and 
fourth in two games), Steve Duchesne (20th) and Dave Taylor (13th). . . . The 
Ranger goals came from Kelly Kisio (19th) and newly acquired Mike Gartner 
(37th). . . . Bernie Nicholls had an assist to give him 100 points for the 
season, the second year in a row he's been in triple figures and third time 
overall.

CHANNEL 2 WILL CARRY UCLA, LOYOLA MARYMOUNT GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Channel 2, KCBS, will televise UCLA's and Loyola Marymount's first-round NCAA 
tournament basketball games live on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's game against Alabama Birmingham in the East Regional at Atlanta will be 
shown at 4 p.m., and Loyola Marymount's game against New Mexico State in the 
West Regional at Long Beach will be televised at 8:30. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has a blackout policy, so there could be a problem with the Loyola 
game if it isn't sold out 24 hours in advance. But the game is expected to sell 
out. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the nation will get the Loyola game on CBS at 11:30 p.m., which 
means it will be live in the East. The announcers will be Greg Gumbel and Quinn 
Buckner. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 2 is picking up the UCLA telecast from NCAA Productions. Announcers had 
not been assigned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Strong, Channel 2's director of programming, said Hank Gathers' death is 
not the reason KCBS decided to show Loyola live. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably would have done it anyway," Strong said. "We are Los Angeles' 
college basketball station, and we have obligations to the fans here." 
</P>
<P>
Strong said Channel 2 scrapped the halftime show of Sunday's delayed telecast 
of the Pacific 10 tournament championship game between UCLA and Arizona to get 
the NCAA tournament pairings announcement on live. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, UCLA's 16-point loss to Arizona got a higher Nielsen rating than 
the pairings show, 4.0 to 3.0. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN has announced it will televise 11 first-round games live, six on Thursday 
and five on Friday. Two of Thursday's telecasts will not be complete games. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN's schedule: 
</P>
<P>
THURSDAY: 9 a.m. -- Clemson-BYU; 11:30 -- La Salle-Southern Mississippi; 1:30 
p.m. -- Louisville-Idaho; 4 -- LSU-Villanova; 6 -- Princeton-Arkansas (second 
half); 7 -- Indiana-California (in progress). 
</P>
<P>
FRIDAY: 9 a.m. -- Duke-Richmond; 11:30 -- Temple-St. John's; 2 p.m. -- 
Alabama-Colorado State; 4 -- Georgia-Texas; 6:30 -- Notre Dame-Virginia.

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: THIS WAS A LONG SHOT FOR MATER DEI GUARD QUINN 
</P>

<P>
Trailing Long Beach Poly by two points late in the Southern California Regional 
Division I championship game Friday, Jason Quinn of Mater Dei took a shot that 
he hadn't intended to take and didn't believe he could make. 
</P>
<P>
Dribbling around the perimeter with fewer than 10 seconds remaining, Quinn 
couldn't get a pass to David Boyle or Andy Karich, so he tried to get his 
defender, Rod Hannibal, to foul him as he attempted a shot near the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
"The play never really got set up as planned, so it was really kind of 
helter-skelter," said Quinn, The Times' Athlete of the Week. "When I felt 
contact, I just threw it up." 
</P>
<P>
Simply explained. But the significance of Quinn's three-point basket that gave 
the Monarchs a 46-45 victory and sent them to the state championship game goes 
far beyond simple. Just ask Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight. 
</P>
<P>
"It will go down in the history of Mater Dei as 'The Shot,' " McKnight said. 
"That's all we will call it. He double-pumped and side-stepped him and just 
threw it up with two hands." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, a point guard, rarely scores much in Mater Dei's balanced offense. He 
averaged about six points during the regular season and led the team with 6.7 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually get one or two shots a game," Quinn said. "It depends on what 
presents itself." 
</P>
<P>
But against Poly he scored eight points in the final 2 minutes 36 seconds, 
including the Monarchs' last six of the game. With 36 seconds remaining, Quinn 
hit a three-pointer that cut Poly's lead to 44-43. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had some real clutch games," McKnight said. "He had 18 in our semifinal 
win over Ocean View (in the Tournament of Champions). He's hit some big 
three-pointers for us too. 
</P>
<P>
But none as big as "The Shot," a basket that still seems improbable to Quinn 
after watching a tape of the game on cable television Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I've watched it three or four times times today," Quinn said. "I still can't 
believe it." 
</P>

OVERSIGHT MAY COST CAMARILLO TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Camarillo High violated a new state rule that limits a pitcher to 30 outs in a 
calendar week during the Scorpions' 4-2 win over Chatsworth last Saturday in 
the Blue Division championship of the Westside tournament at UCLA's Jackie 
Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo's Eric Raba pitched 14 innings, or 42 outs, last week. He pitched 
seven innings in an 8-2 win over Notre Dame last Tuesday, then pitched a second 
complete game in the victory over Chatsworth. The rule, which went into effect 
this season, limits a pitcher to 30 outs from Monday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
According to state rules, violation of the new rule results in a forfeit. But 
Chuck Ice, the tournament director, said Monday that a decision regarding the 
championship game will not be made until he contacts the Southern Section 
office today. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo received commemorative T-shirts and a first-place trophy last 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"The game stands until we verify that it (a violation) happened," Ice said. Ice 
was a member of the baseball advisory committee that developed the new rule. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo Coach Jack Willard said it was an embarrassing oversight. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew the rule, but my thinking was that Raba pitched Tuesday, had three days 
rest, and was coming back on Saturday," said Willard, a first-year coach. "I 
wasn't trying to be sneaky and trick somebody. I just didn't pay attention." 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth Coach Tom Meusborn, also in his first year, said he, too, was 
unaware of the violation. Raba, a senior right-hander who would have been 
limited to three innings in Saturday's game, silenced Chatsworth rallies in the 
fifth and sixth innings. 
</P>
<P>
Raba allowed six hits, three walks, and struck out seven. He also contributed a 
run-scoring triple. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked, but they still executed and we didn't," Meusborn said. "They came 
to play and deserved to win." 
</P>
<P>
Willard said his players were understandably disappointed with Monday's news. 
</P>
<P>
"It's their job to play, and my job to know those rules," Willard said. "It was 
my mistake, and I take full credit for it."

THE PREPS: SANTA CLARA GUARD GETS TO THE POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oxnard Santa Clara boys' basketball team has not lost since December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
That is 44 victories in row, the latest a 91-65 win against Santa Maria St. 
Joseph in the Southern California State Regional Division IV final. 
</P>
<P>
The key player during Santa Clara's streak has been 6-foot-5 senior guard Shon 
Tarver. 
</P>
<P>
Last season's State Division IV player of the year, Tarver has been impressive 
in the playoffs. In averaging over 31 points per game, he has outscored Santa 
Clara's opponents single-handedly during the first half of nearly every game. 
</P>
<P>
Against St. Joseph, Tarver had 40 points, 15 rebounds, six assists and eight 
blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I simply think that he is the best high school player in the country," Santa 
Clara Coach Lou Cvijanovich said. "He has showed it all year and not just in 
the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Tarver, regarded as one of the top prep recruits who is still uncommitted, 
knows how to take control of a game. Against St. Joseph, he scored 16 points in 
a 22-2 second-quarter run. 
</P>
<P>
Tarver also has the ability to make teammates better. That also was evident 
against St. Joseph when his backcourt mate, Bruce Howarth, had 12 first-half 
points and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the Saints' victory Saturday, Tarver patiently signed 
autographs for children and fellow students, but when he was asked a question 
by the media he replied: "I am sorry but Coach (Cvijanovich) does not like for 
us (players) to talk to reporters." 
</P>
<P>
For Cvijanovich's team, this is nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
In 32 years of coaching basketball, he has won 11 Southern Section titles and 
his rule of restricting interviews with his players has remained constant. 
</P>
<P>
The success of Cvijanovich's system also has been consistent, and this season's 
team might be his best, considering the way the Saints have breezed through the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"This team is very explosive. . . . They can score a lot of points at any 
time," Cvijanovich said. "I think that we are a good team and that we can play 
with anybody out there." 
</P>
<P>
Northern California champion Travis AFB Vanden will find out if Cvijanovich is 
right Friday, when it plays Santa Clara for the State Division IV title at the 
Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
If Long Beach Poly had made free throws in the Division I Regional boys' 
basketball final at the Sports Arena as it did against Lynwood in the second 
round, the Jackrabbits would be headed to Oakland instead of Santa Ana Mater 
Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Against Lynwood on Thursday, Poly made 14 of 17 free throws in the fourth 
quarter to clinch a 69-59 victory, but it was a different story the next night. 
</P>
<P>
In the final minute of its 46-45 loss to Mater Dei, Poly made only one of four 
free throws after making seven of 12 earlier in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei will try to keep Southern California's eight-game State Division I 
championship win streak alive against San Francisco Riordan Saturday in 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 Southern California teams that will make the trip to Oakland for the 
State finals, nine are from the Southern Section, which swept boys' and girls' 
titles in divisions I through IV. Only in Division V did the Southern Section 
come up empty, when San Diego Section champion El Cajon Christian won the boys' 
title.

REPORT SAYS DISNEY PLANS BIG FLORIDA DEVELOPMENT

<P>
Walt Disney Co. plans to build a giant commercial office park, up to 6,000 
single family homes and the largest shopping mall in central Florida, a 
newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
The development, which would be Disney's first on its Osceola County property, 
would be built on 4,400 acres straddling Interstate 4, the Orlando Sentinel 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Orange and Osceola county officials who were briefed about the plans last week 
told the Sentinel that Disney was to announce its project at its annual "State 
of Our World" presentation on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Disney officials did not confirm the report. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing to chat about," Disney spokesman John Dreyer said. "I hope 
they've got good crystal balls. I'm not confirming anything. Tell them to come 
to the show on Monday. Come see the 'State of Our World' and find out." 
</P>
<P>
County officials said they were told that Disney planned up to 6,000 
middle-income and executive houses with a starting price of $90,000, the 
Sentinel reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Plans also call for between 6 million and 7 million square feet of commercial 
office space, about 1.2 million square feet of light-industrial office and 
manufacturing space, one or two golf courses and recreation areas, officials 
cited in the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Several community leaders who have seen the plans said Disney did not present 
any timetable for construction or dollar value, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
Disney owns 8,700 acres in the area, of which 40% is swamp, drainage watershed 
and canals.

MCA AGREES TO SELL AILING TOY UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Entertainment giant MCA Inc. has agreed to sell its troubled LJN Toys unit to 
Acclaim Entertainment Inc. for an undisclosed amount of cash and Acclaim common 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Acclaim, a major publisher of software for the popular Nintendo Entertainment 
System, will acquire all of LJN's U.S. operations, with the exception of its 
American Publishing puzzles division. 
</P>
<P>
The accord also gives Acclaim the right to release five additional titles per 
year for the Nintendo Entertainment System under the LJN label. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition remains subject to various government regulatory and legal 
approvals, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
Acclaim, based in Oyster Bay, N.Y., was the first U.S. company to obtain a 
license from Nintendo of America to publish software for the Japanese computer 
game maker. It had sales of nearly $70 million last year, an increase of 76% 
over 1988. 
</P>
<P>
MCA has been plagued by the performance of its LJN unit since consumer 
disenchantment with a faulty LJN toy gun caused MCA profits to plunge 79.5% to 
$8.1 million in the second quarter of 1987. Net income was hurt, in part, by a 
$35-million charge that MCA took to write down the value of LJN's inventory of 
paint-shooting "Gotcha!" toy guns.

JAPAN'S YEN FOR S.D. GROWS STRONGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lured by relatively low prices, a mild coastal climate and a healthy economic 
environment, Japanese investors last year spent $1.1 billion on San Diego real 
estate, making the city the third most popular spot nationwide for Japanese 
real estate investment. 
</P>
<P>
Measured in total dollars spent, San Diego's appeal to Japanese real estate 
investors has more than doubled since 1988, when they paid a total of $421 
million for San Diego real estate, ranking it 11th among U. S. locales. Now 
only Los Angeles and New York attract more Japanese dollars than San Diego, 
according to a report released Monday by Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., a 
certified public accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the economy, increasing employment and increasing population," said 
Mitchell Ellner, a partner in Kenneth Leventhal's San Diego office, in 
explaining the area's appeal. "The demographics of San Diego are such that it's 
considered an enduring market." 
</P>
<P>
Because San Diego had such a small role in the initial wave of Japanese 
investment dollars that began pouring into the country in 1985, the city has 
traditionally been considered of secondary interest to foreign investors. But 
the recent survey shows how much that perception has changed, Ellner said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of San Diego's popularity can be traced to its proximity to Los Angeles, 
which has begun to offer fewer investment opportunities, analysts said. The 
tourist industry, the Tijuana maquiladora program and even the America's Cup 
yacht race have had a hand in making San Diego an attractive investment area 
for foreign investors, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles still attracts the largest amount of investment capital from 
Japanese funding sources, but "there are now limited opportunities in Los 
Angeles and there's perceived to be more growth potential in San Diego," said 
Robert Fox, vice president of TSA Development, a San Diego development firm 
backed by Japanese investors. "It's a city on the go." 
</P>
<P>
Only Las Vegas saw a higher percentage increase in Japanese investment dollars 
in 1989, the Leventhal report says. Japanese investors spent $482 million in 
the gambling capital in 1989, contrasted with $22 million the year before. 
</P>
<P>
"What the Japanese are doing is filling a void since the U. S. sources for real 
estate money are drying up," said Paul Devermann, senior vice president of the 
San Diego Economic Development Corp., a private, nonprofit organization that 
helps creates jobs and industrial development in San Diego County. "The 
Japanese are coming in and taking their traditionally longer view, buying these 
properties with hopes of payoffs in five or 10 years out." 
</P>
<P>
Although most analysts said the Japanese interest in San Diego real estate was 
a boon to local development, some observers were cautionary about the effects 
of too much foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
"On the good side, it brings new money into our economy and brings along 
development that may not have otherwise happened. It helps add to the 
redevelopment of downtown and helps bring new stock to our community," 
Devermann said. 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "On the downside, it has the effect of being inflationary. 
Foreign investment has the tendency to drive up the prices of some of the 
properties more rapidly than they would have otherwise (risen). It makes it 
more expensive in the long term for some development to occur." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Japanese investment capital was spread among some 20 real estate 
developments in San Diego, nearly half of which were mixed-use properties, 
which combine hotel, office and sometimes even retail space in one development 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The largest of the San Diego mixed-use properties acquired by Japanese-funded 
partnerships last year was the El Cortez hotel redevelopment project in 
downtown San Diego. The project has an estimated value of $250 million and will 
eventually include office and retail space. 
</P>
<P>
About 18% of the total amount of Japanese investment capital spent on San Diego 
real estate went into strictly hotel properties, while another 18% went into 
residential developments, the study shows. 
</P>
<P>
New construction projects made up two-thirds of all Japanese-funded development 
in San Diego, with Japanese developers and construction companies contributing 
about 75% of all Japanese investment capital. In most instances, Japanese 
investors entered the market in joint ventures with U. S. real estate 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
The study does not disclose the amount of capital contributed by Japanese 
investors in particular joint-venture or partnership developments. In those 
cases in which the amount of money contributed by Japanese investors could not 
be reliably ascertained, the study used the total value of the joint venture 
"on the assumption that, without the Japanese financial backing, the deal would 
not go through," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the El Cortez development, the next four largest San Diego real 
estate properties on which Japanese investors spent their yen in 1989 include: 
</P>
<P>
* A 922-unit apartment complex on Renaissance Avenue in La Jolla, valued at 
$140 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Great American Plaza, under construction in downtown San Diego, worth $170 
million. 
</P>
<P>
* Four Seasons Hotel, part of the Aviara Resort in Carlsbad, worth $100 
million. 
</P>
<P>
* Le Meridien Hotel in Coronado, valued at $87 million.

OHIO TOWN TO FIGHT PLANNED CHEMICAL PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald Wirtshafter, an Athens, Ohio, attorney, has a message for American 
Plastics and Chemicals Inc. of Canoga Park: "Go home." 
</P>
<P>
Wirtshafter and others in the small Appalachian community (pop. 23,000) want 
the company to abandon its plans to build a chemical plant on a 2,500-acre site 
nearby. People in Athens are worried that toxic chemicals from the plant might 
leak or cause an explosion, or that trucks or rail cars might spill the 
substances near homes or schools. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how safe a plant is, if there should be emissions, if there should 
be an accident, you're talking about human lives being affected," said Athens 
County Commissioner Roxanne Groff. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't do a damn thing to us," counters Charles Williams, American 
Plastics' office manager. 
</P>
<P>
But Athens townspeople say there is something they can do. The community has a 
long history of public participation, Wirtshafter said, and it plans to be 
involved at every step of the permitting process. American Plastics is "going 
to have to jump through about 10 years of regulatory hoops," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And if that doesn't work, said Robert Shostak, another local attorney, "We can 
sue." 
</P>
<P>
American Plastics plans to build a plant that would manufacture toluene 
diisocyanate, or TDI, a toxic and flammable chemical compound, and possibly 
manufacture a related compound called methane diisocyanate, or MDI. TDI is used 
to make polyurethane foam, the stuff that insulates refrigerators and freezers. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of making TDI from petroleum, as other companies do, American 
Plastics says it has a new technology for producing the compound from coal and 
limestone. It claims this new process is "pollution-free." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent memo to Groff, Williams talked about his company's "fail-safe" 
method for recycling all waste products generated in the production process. 
American Plastics has "the only technology that can manufacture TDI or MDI 
without polluting the air, land, or water," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The companies that currently make TDI in the United States are all large 
concerns. The biggest producer is Mobay, a subsidiary of Bayer USA, followed by 
Olin, BASF, Dow Chemical and ICI Americas. They all make TDI from petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Bernard, a chemical industry analyst at Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., a 
Maryland Heights, Mo., brokerage firm, said American Plastics' new technology 
still must be proved. "A lot of companies make a lot of claims, but what it 
comes down to is when they get it up and running," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the Athens residents don't stop American Plastics from building its 
plant, the company's lack of financial resources just might. 
</P>
<P>
American Plastics was formerly Petro Oil &amp; Gas, a Texas company that filed 
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1983 and was basically a shell company 
when chairman H. Grant Heaton took over in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
According to a resume from American Plastics, Heaton's former occupations 
include work as a Mormon missionary and as an executive at a Hong Kong trading 
company. The resume said only that Heaton conducted "business" in the Far East 
just prior to joining American Plastics. 
</P>
<P>
Since Heaton arrived, according to documents filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, the company has been "in a development phase" and has been 
financed by Hitexonics, a Hong Kong investment company. American Plastics has 
about eight officers and 17 other people across the country, mostly engineers, 
who are affiliated with the company. 
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal first quarter that ended Nov. 30, American Plastics had no sales 
and posted a net loss of $28,370. It had just $1,294 of cash on hand. Its stock 
trades for less than $1 on the "pink sheets," where thinly traded stocks are 
listed. The company's headquarters are small, rented offices in Canoga Park, 
but officials say the company will be moving soon to offices near Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, American Plastics has big plans to build plants in the United 
States and China. Last month, it announced it had agreed to buy the Athens 
County site containing 20 million tons of coal reserves for $1.55 million in 
cash, stock and debt. Its joint venture partner in buying the land is BD 
Holdings, a Texas oil and gas company. 
</P>
<P>
American Plastics has also formed a joint venture with Perkins Power in 
Sheridan, Wyo., to build a plant on Perkins-owned land. American Plastics says 
it has also contracted to build four TDI and MDI chemical plants in China and 
has letters of intent to build eight more there. 
</P>
<P>
If American Plastics is going to build these plants, which could cost up to 
$200 million each to build, it's going to need big money. The company admits it 
has not yet secured the financing and will say only that it will soon announce 
a joint venture partnership with a Fortune 100 company, which it wouldn't 
identify. 
</P>
<P>
William Morris, the president of BD Holdings, was identified by American 
Plastics as its "president-elect." But he said he is not an officer or director 
of American Plastics, although he was authorized to speak for American Plastics 
in the absence of Heaton and Ed Matovich -- the chemical engineer who invented 
the new TDI/ MDI technology -- who were in China. 
</P>
<P>
Morris said American Plastics is considering three sites in Ohio for its plant, 
and it might decide against the Athens property after it reviews factors such 
as access to power, roads and rail. He said local opposition would be "a 
consideration" in its decision. If the plant isn't built there, Morris said, BD 
Holdings would drill for oil on the land. 
</P>
<P>
Morris said his affiliation with American Plastics is dependent on the backing 
of a Fortune 100 company and on the results of tests of the new technology set 
to take place in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
The technology American Plastics is touting involves burning coal and limestone 
in a reactor to produce acetylene, which is then converted to benzene. The 
benzene is used to make TDI and MDI. 
</P>
<P>
The company says this "closed-loop" system will use up all waste products and 
will even generate power that can be used to run the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Morris said escrow on the Athens land would close at the end of April, and 
completion of a plant is at least 2 1/2 years away. He said the plant would be 
designed and built by Badger Design &amp; Constructors, a subsidiary of 
Raytheon, a defense and industrial concern. 
</P>
<P>
A Badger spokesman said Badger wasn't yet familiar with American Plastics' 
technology. "We're sort of standing by," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in Athens is averse to the plant, said Tim Lairson, superintendent 
of the Federal Hocking Local School District, which includes Athens. Lairson 
said some district officials are "salivating over the amount of tax dollars" 
the plant could generate, which could total a "conservative" $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
But many Athens residents aren't buying American Plastics' assurances that the 
technology is safe and pollution free. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't have processing without waste," said James Tong, a chemistry 
professor at Ohio University. Sandra Sleight-Brennan, a part-time teacher at 
the university, worries because her two children attend an elementary school 
two miles from the American Plastics land. "I don't want to be a guinea pig," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The town of Athens is in the heart of Athens County, a lush, forested area with 
a population of just 58,000 spread over 484 square miles. Though the county is 
in northeastern Ohio, where much of the chemical and plastics industry is 
centered and where coal and limestone is still strip-mined, Athens has remained 
relatively untouched by these industries. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a very militant enclave of environmentalists here," said Jim Phillips, 
an editor at the Athens News. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, when another company wanted to strip-mine coal on the property that 
American Plastics is acquiring, the Athens townspeople were defiant. Although 
the company secured permits to mine the land, the local people won the right to 
inspect the sight at any time to ensure the company was complying with 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
After a mishap that caused some underground water to be contaminated with acid, 
the company left the property without mining any coal. 
</P>
<P>
Athens residents also remember a scare from 10 years ago, when a train derailed 
and spilled TDI in the Athens County town of Millfield. The area was evacuated, 
but since it was the middle of winter, the compound solidified, making the 
cleanup relatively easy. 
</P>
<P>
Several years later, Wirtshafter said, the "back to the land" environmentalists 
in Athens are lawyers, scientists and educators who are well-equipped to fight 
American Plastics. "This community is organized and knowledgeable about what 
it's going to take to stop them from coming here," he said.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: PERCEPTRONICS TO LAY OFF 50 AFTER LOSING CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perceptronics Inc. in Woodland Hills said it plans to lay off 50 workers in the 
next few months because it lost a defense contract. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which makes simulators and other training equipment, said it was 
not selected to provide continued support of SIMNET training sites. SIMNET, 
which Perceptronics helped develop, enables simulators of tanks, helicopters 
and other defense equipment to fight one another over a computer network. 
</P>
<P>
However, Perceptronics said, it was awarded a separate, $1.7-million contract 
to provide battle-training simulators to the Taiwanese army. The 1-year 
contract, Perceptronics' first with Taiwan, calls for the company to install a 
system that trains commanders in simulated battlefield situations.

Transamerica Insurance Co. in Woodland Hills said it agreed to acquire 
Completion Bond Co. from its sole owner, Bette Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase price was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Transamerica is a property-casualty insurance arm of Transamerica Corp. CBC

MAAZEL LEADS ORCHESTRE NATIONAL DE FRANCE AT UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Much has been written about the national characteristics of orchestras, most of 
it on the level of casual stereotypes rather than serious analysis. Here to 
open the ears of doubters about French orchestras -- and to buoy admirers -- is 
Lorin Maazel and the Orchestre National de France, back almost three years to 
the day since their last local appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Maazel's program, Sunday evening at Royce Hall, UCLA, was certainly a paragon 
of typecasting -- familiar snippets from Berlioz, Debussy and Roussel, plus 
Messiaen's "Les offrandes oubliees." An encore? The Farandole from Bizet's 
"L'Arlesienne" music. 
</P>
<P>
There was variety and abundant opportunities for orchestral glory on that 
agenda, if not much occasion for probing from the podium. The weightiest piece 
was the opening Messiaen, and there Maazel opted for detachment, divorcing the 
sounds from the composer's mystical passion in a cool, quick and impersonal 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Maazel reserved his emotional and psychological insights for the love music 
from Berlioz's "Romeo et Juliette," in an expansively developed account of 
great sincerity and sonic beauty. He prefaced it with a gossamer Queen Mab 
scherzo and followed it with Romeo's soulful agitations and the Capulet's 
party, both clearly defined. 
</P>
<P>
Parties and processions served Maazel and company well Sunday, with crisp, 
colorful, thoroughly physical performances of the Second Suite from Roussel's 
"Bacchus et Ariane," and Fetes from Debussy's "Nocturnes." If their abilities 
in moody soundscapes needed testimony, there was an evocative Nuages from 
"Nocturnes." 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra proved itself again an alert, idiosyncratic and unanimous 
ensemble of balance and sheen, capable of a great noise and subtle murmurs. 
Occasionally, it sounded a bit thin on top, and thick around the middle, but 
the sectional and individual solos were brilliantly realized, particularly the 
distinguished lyric efforts of principal violist Tasso Adamopoulous. JOHN 
HENKEN

NEW SDSU COMPANY COULD HOLD ITS OWN WITH THE PROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a weekend of firsts for San Diego State University dance students and 
faculty as "Showcase 90" presented the premiere of the school's University 
Dance Company and the opening of the renovated Studio Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
A third first was the premiere of a highly theatrical work designed by famed 
San Francisco choreographer Joe Goode. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant development for SDSU's degree-granting program in dance 
(inaugurated last fall) was the unveiling of the Studio Theatre, which 
underwent a two-year face lift. The remodeled space cannot compare to the 
university's main stage, but it represents a quantum leap in technical support 
over the original facility. 
</P>
<P>
Lighting capabilities have increased about sevenfold. A computerized sound 
system improved the musical accompaniment, although there were a couple of 
glitches on opening night. And the new hardwood dance floor should be a boon to 
the performers. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-member University Dance Company, skimmed from the degree program, was 
surprisingly adept and well-rehearsed. In fact, this ensemble could hold its 
own with most of the local groups that aspire to professional status. 
</P>
<P>
The faculty and a couple of guest choreographers supplied the eager performers 
with quality choreography for the seven-piece program. 
</P>
<P>
The most provocative and challenging piece was the finale, Goode's sardonic 
"Something About Doris," another segment in Goode's famed "Disaster Series." 
</P>
<P>
"Something About Doris" (the title refers to Doris Day, Goode's metaphor for 
the American Dream) took pot shots at the idealism and naivete of youth. 
Consequently, it was well-served by the young dancers, even when the darker 
sides of the dance eluded their grasp. 
</P>
<P>
Taxing lifts and sudden explosions of movement that seemed to come right out of 
the blue were juxtaposed with a comic solo by Coco Campbell (decked out in a 
wedding gown, but reciting her romantic lines with obvious disappointment). It 
was a devilishly difficult work, and the dancers threw themselves into it with 
gusto. 
</P>
<P>
Another high-water mark for the evening was Carl Yamamoto's "Folia." With the 
music of Gregorio Paniagua driving them on, an ensemble of five deadpan dancers 
(dressed in white surgical scrubs and looking like fugitives from "One Flew 
Over the Cuckoo's Nest") maneuvered through a litany of wacky movements. 
</P>
<P>
Although "Folia" is only a work in progress, it abounds with quirky invention, 
and confirms Yamamoto's talent for off-the-wall imagery and complex motional 
forms. The dancing was tiptop as well. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Sandback, a leading local choreographer and member of the SDSU 
faculty, contributed two works: "Hallways," a solo for Lani Palladino, and "In 
Between Silence," a complex, unpredictable ensemble piece with angst on its 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
Palladino was never out of control in her solo appearance, even when the dance 
changed directions with lightning speed. And she had enough amplitude of 
movement to sweep through the broad phrases of "Hallways" like a hot knife 
through butter. 
</P>
<P>
George Willis, director of the dance program, has a cockeyed sense of humor 
that always surfaces in his dances. His latest work, aptly titled "Scratch," 
was Willis at his zaniest, as five dancers in ape masks and white dinner 
jackets engaged in an incongruous mix of animal moves. There was very little 
dance logic to this whimsical throw-away. But it was a bona fide rib tickler, 
complete with witty sight gags and wild kinetic horseplay. 
</P>
<P>
Meredith Monk's music set the stage for "root," a gymnastic dance that included 
legwork with a ladder and floor-bound writhings by a pair of women constricted 
in their movements by form-fitting gowns. 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Nunn reprised her recent Jazz Unlimited work "Summons," with guest 
dancer Stacy Scardino in the solo role. The rest of the cast consisted of 
students, and they acquitted themselves admirably. However, the overall impact 
of the piece was blunted by the bare-bones studio setting. 
</P>
<P>
Some technical glitches in the new theater: The uncomfortable, makeshift 
seating has not been corrected, nor have the annoying light spills from the 
studio windows. Why didn't somebody think about installing dark curtains during 
the remodeling? 
</P>
<P>
The seating capacity has been somewhat increased, but there were still 
squatters sprawling all over the floor -- some even spilling over into the 
aisles (and blocking the exit) during Friday night's jampacked performance.

A SOLICITOUS PAULEY 'CHANGES' IN PRIME TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As we have read again and again and again, Jane Pauley is going through these 
changes. After being wrenched from "Today" after 13 years, she's being 
reconstituted for NBC prime-time exposure, including an hour special at 10 
tonight broadly called . . . "Changes: Conversations With Jane Pauley." 
</P>
<P>
She did four segments with people going through changes, including 
be-bop-saxophonist-and-now-recovering-heroin-junkie-convict Frank Morgan, now 
56. "At 19, Frank had a record album but was working on a criminal record too," 
she intones from the most awful script since "Supertrain." "Forgery was his 
ticket to San Quentin." 
</P>
<P>
Another: Becky did some drugs, skipped some school and fled home a few times as 
a teen-age brat. That was eight years ago, when Pauley first met her and her 
folks. Now they all claim to have changed. The parents profess to understand 
but they still look to be in pain; the daughter, now 23, is married with a baby 
and, despite fawning by the host, is unrepentant and still a snot. 
</P>
<P>
Another: Comic-in-the-round Louie Anderson talks earnestly about boyhood abuse 
by his now-deceased alcoholic father (Pauley asks how he was abused; Anderson 
says he was belittled). Now he's selling his million-dollar house in our town 
and going off to seclusion to walk a lot and lose weight and find himself. 
</P>
<P>
There are some insightful moments in all this, but the assembly of interview 
bites is all muddle and mush and the script should be beaten with a stick. 
Pauley is incredibly solicitous to the point of pain. Her career has been 
playing wide-eyed, which might have worked in the early morning hours but drags 
as the day dwindles on. Can a person be too nice? 
</P>
<P>
At least this is the first story you've read about Jane Pauley in the last six 
months that hasn't mentioned Deborah Norville. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Oh, darn. . . .

RENEGADES WON LOYAL FANS IN INNER CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
True to their names, the Raiders came to Los Angeles eight years ago as 
renegades, a swaggering, blustering team made up of outcasts and ruffians. 
</P>
<P>
In a city known for style, glamour and poolside chic, the act was a tough sell. 
The sports market was dominated by the blue-blooded Dodgers and Magic Johnson's 
"Showtime" Lakers. The Raiders were an alien lot, thugs, blue-collar guys, 
hard-bitten pugilists. 
</P>
<P>
But the Raiders managed to carve out a following. The announcement on Monday of 
the team's intention to return to Oakland drew cries of disappointment from 
many parts of town. Mostly, the disappointment was centered in the inner city, 
in neighborhoods surrounding the Coliseum, in portions of East and 
South-Central Los Angeles where the Raiders stood for toughness and defiance. 
</P>
<P>
"The Raiders are tops -- they've always been tops," said Mario Bernal, owner of 
Bernal's Sporting Goods on busy Whittier Boulevard in East L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Tough, gritty East Los Angeles was one place where Raiders' caps and jackets 
sold abundantly. Bernal said he sold hundreds of the black-and-silver caps a 
year, mostly the less-expensive $4.25 version. Latino residents rallied around 
the Raiders far more than they did around the Rams, who preceded them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know exactly what it is," Bernal said. "In my area, all the people of 
Mexican descent, the young people, they talk about the Raiders. When they're 
talking about the Raiders, they feel proud." 
</P>
<P>
According to a Los Angeles Times Poll conducted earlier this year, the typical 
Raiders fan was politically middle-of-the-road, a relatively well-paid college 
graduate. Thirty-eight percent of the Raiders' followers called themselves 
white-collar, compared to 33% who held blue-collar jobs. A significant number 
were in management. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 18% of Raiders fans were black and 14% Latino, compared with 
6% black and 14% Latino for the Dodgers and 14% black and 11% Latino for the 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
Raiders caps have long been the most popular athletic headwear of Los Angeles 
street gangs, most notably the Crips. 
</P>
<P>
"Loud, noisy . . . mucho macho" is how Jack Abbott described the typical 
Raiders fan. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott, the manager at Julie's Trojan Barrel Bar &amp; Grill, a venerable 
sports hangout near the Coliseum, has seen the pregame and postgame crowds 
dwindle by 40% since the team first invaded the city. 
</P>
<P>
The blame falls largely on the losing seasons the team has endured in recent 
years, according to Abbott. Another factor, he said, may be ticket prices that 
have reached $30 a seat, more than some of the team's inner-city followers 
could afford. 
</P>
<P>
"For four people to go, that's $100-plus," Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
Like many businesses surrounding the Coliseum, Julie's expects to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
"We went through it with the Rams (leaving) and we were three years without a 
professional football team," Abbott remembered. "We ended up with the Raiders 
and everybody happy. Now it's all gloom and doom again." 
</P>
<P>
Also affected would be an untold number of sandwich shops and liquor stores, as 
well as the game-day entrepreneurs who turned their own small driveways and 
front yards into pay-parking lots, erecting huge white plywood signs. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the Coliseum area were often hired as vendors, selling peanuts, 
ice cream and beer. Youth centers such as Challengers Boys and Girls Club on 
South Vermont Avenue occasionally received batches of 20 or 30 free tickets 
from the Raiders, enabling underprivileged children and teen-agers to go to 
games. 
</P>
<P>
On Sundays, the cheering of the football crowds could be heard -- a distant 
inspiration -- by the youngsters hanging around the gym at Challengers, said 
counselor Michael Lopez. Last year, on separate days, Raiders stars Marcus 
Allen and Bo Jackson visited the club to talk to its children and teen-agers. 
</P>

Jackson, promoting Nike products, talked, signed autographs and chose winners 
in a poster contest, Lopez said. The crowd, mostly black and Latino youngsters, 
numbered 300 or 400. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh man, I'll tell you, we had a tremendous number of kids," Lopez said. "You 
get somebody like that here . . . and the kids really get excited. They want to 
be like him." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Robertson, former chairman of the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission, whose 
split with Raiders owner Al Davis prompted plans for the team's move, decried 
the impact the proposed move would have on a community that, more than 
anything, needs a lift in morale. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm frustrated and disappointed," Robertson said. "I can't pinpoint what it 
means in dollars. (But) it was that type of ballclub that had an appeal to 
middle-class people, to the working people and minorities. (Until recently) 
they had a Hispanic coach, Tom Flores. They had a lot of blacks. They had the 
right image." 
</P>
<P>
Robertson criticized the media -- in particular The Times -- for a reluctance 
to embrace the Raiders when they arrived in Los Angeles. The city's fans, 
however, were willing to support the franchise -- at least while it was 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole damn story is, that vocal support . . . out there is for winners," 
Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
Although attendance at games fell dramatically after the Raiders last made it 
to the Super Bowl -- they won the 1984 game -- members of the eclectic 
following sometimes drove considerable distances to root for the maverick cast 
of athletes. 
</P>
<P>
A hard-core group of 40 or 45 fans has made a tradition of having game-day 
brunch at Sausalito South, a restaurant and bar in Manhattan Beach, and 
boarding a bus to go see the Raiders play. The group, mostly aerospace workers, 
computer operators and real estate salespeople with season tickets, were bound 
together by a love for "good, hard, aggressive football," said Michael Bloss, 
general manager of the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
On days of big games, sometimes two buses were necessary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, who practice in nearby El Segundo, repaid the loyalty by coming 
around at lunch, Bloss said. On Monday nights, former star Lyle Alzado and, 
more recently, Rod Martin would host a noisy, crowded session in the bar 
watching "Monday Night Football." 
</P>
<P>
"If they move, we'll certainly miss them," Bloss said, putting the blame not on 
the Raiders but on what he described as the deteriorated condition of the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want me to go to the Coliseum, they need to fix it up," he said. "It 
is not an enjoyable place to walk through a (pedestrian) tunnel -- it smells 
like a urinal. If there was a decent stadium, you'd probably get a better 
turnout." 
</P>
<P>
Lance Keller of Murray's Tickets, a 53-year-old ticket brokerage firm, said 
even the Rams struggled to draw fans to Los Angeles during losing seasons. "I 
just don't think L.A. is that big a football town," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But to those who wanted it to be, like Los Angeles City Councilman Robert 
Farrell, the likely move stands as a difficult blow to take. 
</P>
<P>
"The Raiders are a class act," said Farrell, whose inner-city district includes 
the Coliseum. "They are made to order for the people. We're very pleased they 
were here. They brought a lot of excitement. Whatever they were, they were our 
team." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THROUGH THE YEARS: QUOTABLES 
</P>
<P>
"The right thing to do is to admit we don't have the money (for the Raiders)." 
-- Then-Los Angeles County Supervisor Baxter Ward, describing at a May 6, 1980, 
meeting his opposition to a $5-million loan offered to lure Al Davis to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"After all the effort to get the Raiders in the Coliseum, to see Al Davis sign 
an agreement with Irwindale upsets me to no end." -- Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Ed Edelman, Aug. 20, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Let him go. L.A.'s the place, and if he doesn't want to be here, get out of 
town. . . . I think we ought to call his bluff." -- Los Angeles City Councilman 
Nate Holden, reacting on Aug. 20, 1987, to Davis' announcement he was moving 
the team to Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
"We learned early on that the only way to deal with Davis is straight up. No 
smoke. No mirrors. We think we've negotiated a deal that is fair to both 
sides." -- Xavier Hermosillo, Irwindale spokesman, Aug. 20, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Raiders leave, they leave. It doesn't matter." -- David Bort, former 
manager of Tyson's Choice ticket agency on Martin Luther King Boulevard behind 
the Coliseum, reacting on Aug. 21, 1987, to news the team would move to 
Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
"He throws manure at you until it piles so high you throw in the towel." -- 
Unidentified Coliseum Commission member, describing Davis' negotiating style on 
Aug. 24, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not over. It ain't over till the ink's dry and the deal's done. But if 
they leave, the Coliseum and Sports Arena will find new tenants. The Raiders 
are an absolutely great client, but that's it. Nothing more." -- Los Angeles 
City Councilman Robert Farrell, reacting on Aug. 21, 1987, to announcement that 
Raiders planned to move to Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
"If Davis left Oakland, where he had a good financial situation, how do we know 
he won't leave Los Angeles someday?" -- City Council President John Ferraro, 
Sept. 7, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has been more guilty of bad faith and unfair dealings than the Coliseum 
Commission." -- Raiders official Irv Kaze, Sept. 30, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"We're committed to Irwindale. We're going to Irwindale." -- Kaze, Dec. 4, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Davis seems to have a history of out-negotiating whoever is on the other side. 
. . . He was successful in that with Irwindale. He got $10 million in his pants 
pocket from them before the financing for that deal was arranged." -- Marshall 
Grossman, attorney representing the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission, Aug. 13, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to keep the Raiders but we don't want to be raped." -- Then-Los 
Angeles Deputy Mayor Mike Gage, Aug. 13, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Now Oakland will become the sports capital of the world." -- Oakland Mayor 
Lionel Wilson, March 12, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to congratulate Oakland and I wish the Raiders the best of luck." -- 
Los Angeles Coliseum Commission President Richard Riordan, March 12, 1990.

MENENDEZ TAPES CRUCIAL, REINER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tape-recorded conversations between two Beverly Hills brothers and the 
psychologist who treated them after the savage shotgun slaying of their parents 
are crucial evidence in the case against the pair, Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner defended the prosecution's attempt to use the tapes, which were seized 
by police last week and precipitated the arrests of Lyle Menendez, 22, and his 
brother, Erik, 19. The brothers had been suspects since the slayings last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
However, defense attorney Gerald L. Chaleff, who represents Lyle Menendez, said 
later that "It is our position that the material taken from the psychotherapist 
is privileged and cannot be used in any way." 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference at his office, Reiner said the confidentiality usually 
accorded therapist-patient exchanges does not apply "where there is a 
continuing threat of violence to others and, understand, this is a case of 
murder." 
</P>
<P>
Although Reiner did not amplify on his comment about a threat, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Elliott Alhadeff said later that threats were made against L. Jerome 
Oziel, the Beverly Hills psychologist who made the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Oziel, who had been counseling the Menendez family, is cooperating with 
authorities, the district attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
The Menendez brothers, who are being held without bail, were to have been 
arraigned Monday afternoon, and the district attorney's office moved to unseal 
a search warrant affidavit revealing details about the controversial tapes. 
</P>
<P>
However, at the defense's request, the arraignment, affidavit decision and bail 
motions were postponed by Beverly Hills Municipal Court Judge Judith O. Stein 
until March 26. The prosecution turned over a four-inch stack of evidence to 
the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys said they need time to prepare their argument that the 
therapist-patient relationship was violated by the seizure of psychotherapy 
records and to determine whether statements in the affidavit are privileged and 
should remain sealed. 
</P>
<P>
Robert L. Shapiro, who represents Erik, said his client -- who was playing in a 
professional tennis tournament in Israel when he learned that he was wanted -- 
was "quite concerned. I think his actions (in returning to surrender 
voluntarily) show great character and great strength." 
</P>
<P>
The two young men, somber-faced and dressed in business suits, appeared briefly 
in the packed Beverly Hills courtroom to hear the charges, as family members, 
who have rallied behind them, looked on. 
</P>
<P>
Each brother faces special circumstance allegations of multiple murders, 
killing for financial gain and lying in wait. If convicted, they could be 
sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
"We are alleging as a motive financial gain," Reiner said at his news 
conference earlier. "I don't know what your experience is, but it's been our 
experience in the district attorney's office that $14 million (the estate the 
sons stood to inherit) provides ample motive for someone to kill somebody." 
</P>
<P>
The victims, Jose Menendez, 45, chief executive of Live Entertainment of Van 
Nuys, a video and music distributor, and his wife, Kitty, 44, were found dead 
in their Beverly Hills mansion last Aug. 20, hit numerous times with blasts 
from two 12-gauge shotguns fired at close range. 
</P>
<P>
The sons told authorities they found their parents' bodies when they returned 
from a night out. 
</P>
<P>
There was no sign of forced entry into the home. Nor was there any indication 
of a robbery, and no murder weapons were found. 
</P>
<P>
Shotgun shell wadding was found at the scene of the murder and police later 
obtained an expended 12-gauge shotgun shell casing that sources said had been 
found in one of Lyle's jackets. 
</P>
<P>
Although speculation immediately after the killings centered on the possibility 
that it was an organized crime hit, police said they also began looking at the 
sons' possible involvement early on. 
</P>
<P>
"From the very outset we had suspicions of the boys' involvement," said Lt. 
Russ Olson, the Beverly Hills Police Department's chief of detectives. "As more 
evidence developed, it pointed only in one direction." 
</P>
<P>
According to the terms of a 1980 will, Menendez, in the event of his and his 
wife's simultaneous deaths, left his entire $14-million estate to his two sons. 
After estate taxes were subtracted, the brothers stood to receive $3 million 
each. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, a $400,000 life insurance policy on Jose Menendez already has 
been distributed to Lyle and Erik. 
</P>
<P>
During their investigation, detectives also discovered that the family's home 
computer had been tampered with after the murders to delete a reference to a 
will. They believe that the will, whether old or new, was intentionally 
destroyed by Lyle, according to several sources familiar with the police 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives told The Times that in recent years Jose Menendez was discussing 
changing his will to take into account his rapidly growing wealth. But 
relatives said there was no evidence that a new will was ever written.

ORTEGA TO TURN OVER POWER APRIL 25, HE ASSURES QUAYLE 
</P>

<P>
In the first substantive meeting in at least six years between a senior U.S. 
official and Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, the Sandinista leader promised 
Vice President Dan Quayle on Monday that he will relinquish power as scheduled 
next month, Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
"He guaranteed me two things: One, on April 25 he will turn over his presidency 
to Violeta (Barrios de) Chamorro, and two, he guaranteed to me that Violeta 
Chamorro will appoint all of the ministries, including the Defense Ministry and 
the Interior Ministry," the vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle added: "We are going to work with him and others to make this happen. I 
believe it will happen." 
</P>
<P>
While Ortega has made such promises during the 2 1/2 weeks since Chamorro upset 
him in the Nicaraguan presidential election, a senior U.S. official traveling 
with Quayle said that Monday's pledge, made directly to the vice president, was 
taken by the Bush Administration as "a very definitive commitment" that "the 
vice president found . . . very assuring." 
</P>
<P>
Ortega's promise to hand over the powerful Interior and Defense ministries -- 
and to guarantee that their new ministers would report to Chamorro -- was seen 
as particularly important because those posts control the governmental 
machinery through which the Sandinistas have exercised much of their control of 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
The two leaders encountered each other three times during the day in Santiago, 
where they were attending celebrations marking the peaceful transfer of power 
to a democratically elected government after 16 1/2 years of dictatorship by 
Gen. Augusto Pinochet. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega, comparing the experience in Chile this weekend to the transition facing 
Nicaragua, pledged "to make the transfer in Nicaragua more peaceful than the 
transfer here in Chile," the Vice President said. 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez said during a 
meeting here with Quayle that he and other Central American leaders had agreed 
to meet March 30 and 31, presumably in Nicaragua, and "the main item will be 
the repatriation of the Contras," most of whom are in camps in Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle spoke to reporters as he was about to board Air Force II en route to 
Asuncion, Paraguay, his fourth stop on a seven-day, seven-nation tour of the 
West Indies and South America. 
</P>
<P>
While Quayle's aides said Ortega attached no conditions to his promises, the 
Nicaraguan president told reporters in Santiago that the best way for a normal 
transition to take place "would be that the Contras cease to exist by April 
25," when Chamorro is scheduled to take office. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega said Quayle responded that the United States would "seek ways of 
supporting that idea so that the Contras are no longer around by April 25." 
</P>
<P>
However, a senior vice presidential assistant said Quayle only agreed that the 
United States would work toward the demobilization of the Contras without 
setting a specific date for their disbanding. 
</P>
<P>
The twinned questions of the futures of the Contras, the rebel army supported 
by the United States, and of the Sandinista-led Nicaraguan army have dogged 
officials in the United States and Central America as they seek the smooth 
transfer of power from Ortega to Chamorro after eight years of guerrilla 
warfare. 
</P>
<P>
The Contras are reluctant to lay down their weapons while the Sandinistas 
maintain control of the highly politicized Nicaraguan army. And the 
Sandinistas, for their part, have sought guarantees of their safety as the 
opposition leaders, aligned with the Contras, take over civilian authority in 
the strife-torn Central American nation. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has proposed that United Nations peacekeeping forces could be 
inserted between the two hostile camps, and Ortega was said to have told Quayle 
"that would be fine if they were willing to take a risk." 
</P>
<P>
With Bush about to announce a package of economic assistance for Nicaragua, 
Ortega was also said to have asked Quayle for the immediate lifting of economic 
sanctions imposed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. The vice president 
responded, aides said, that Chamorro had already sought such a move and that it 
was being "actively considered by the White House." 
</P>
<P>
Economic advisers to the Nicaraguan president-elect have asked for $200 million 
to $300 million in aid, and Bush is expected to announce his decision today. 
</P>
<P>
After years of hostility between Washington and Managua, Quayle ended up 
meeting three times on Monday with Ortega, with each meeting longer than the 
previous one and the tone apparently growing warmer as the day progressed. 
</P>
<P>
The longest session occurred over lunch at the Chilean and presidential palace 
with the collection of foreign leaders attending the Chilean celebrations. 
Ortega asked Arias to switch seats with him so that he could sit next to 
Quayle. The two men then ended up in a conversation that lasted 1 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega later described the discussion as "frank, friendly and constructive." 
</P>
<P>
At a 10-minute meeting during a reception that preceded the luncheon, Quayle 
was said by an aide to have told Ortega that the transfer of power cannot be 
held up while he waits for the Contras to lay down their arms. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't make unilateral demobilization of the Contras a precondition for the 
transfer of power," Quayle told Ortega, according to a senior Quayle aide. 
</P>
<P>
At their first meeting of the day, they encountered each other for barely one 
minute at the start of a Roman Catholic Mass celebrating a return of democracy 
to Chile. 
</P>
<P>
The interaction throughout the day between Quayle and Ortega reflected the 
turnabout that is occurring in Central America. The vice president, who has 
certainly shared President Bush's angry rhetoric toward the Sandinistas and 
perhaps gone beyond it in harshness, appeared generally relaxed about his 
encounters.

WILL GORBACHEV'S REFORMS BRING BREAKUP OF NATION?

Who lost Lithuania? 
</P>
<P>
That question is bound to arise if Lithuania secedes from the Soviet Union as 
desired, and with it will come tougher, more fundamental questions about the 
ultimate impact of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's liberalizing reforms. 
</P>
<P>
In permitting the upsurge of ethnic nationalism and then not suppressing 
secessionist drives, has Gorbachev not created conditions for the breakup of 
the whole Soviet Union? If Lithuania goes, what will bind Latvia and Estonia, 
the two other Baltic republics, Azerbaijan or Georgia in the south, Moldavia on 
the Romanian border, or the Ukraine? 
</P>
<P>
In withdrawing the Communist Party from day-to-day management of the government 
and the economy, and then accepting a multi-party political system, first of 
all in Lithuania, has Gorbachev not stripped the party of its authority and 
even its legitimacy? Will the party's decision to yield its monopoly on power 
not bring its downfall? 
</P>
<P>
What will Gorbachev's reforms have achieved if the Soviet Union has been left 
in political chaos and dismembered as a state? And would his liberalism survive 
such developments? 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's political survival will undoubtedly depend on his ability to defend 
himself from these and other charges that his policies have brought the 
collapse of the Soviet Union as a superpower and as the leader of world 
socialism. 
</P>
<P>
He has long argued that the country's multiple political, economic and social 
crises are the result of its prolonged stagnation under the late President 
Leonid I. Brezhnev and the "deformation" of socialism that occurred earlier, 
notably under dictator Josef Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
Glasnost, or political openness, may have brought suppressed problems to the 
surface, Gorbachev has contended, but it did not create them. And without such 
openness, they could not be solved. 
</P>
<P>
In Gorbachev's view, Lithuania's complaints -- starting with its forced 
incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1940 under a deal between Stalin and 
Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany -- only confirm the need for radical 
political and economic reforms, including the establishment of a new federal 
system for the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
But such arguments run counter to the temper of the times and receive less and 
less of a hearing here. 
</P>
<P>
Confidence in perestroika, as Gorbachev's reforms are known, is declining, 
according to all recent opinion surveys here. After five years under his 
leadership, the country has grown increasingly impatient, and the mood is one 
of growing pessimism. 
</P>
<P>
The belief in liberalism that grew in the first three or four years of 
perestroika has given way to the conviction that a "strong hand," even "an iron 
rod," is needed to bring the country to order and ensure progress. 
</P>
<P>
In this political atmosphere, many would interpret Lithuania's decision to 
secede from the Soviet Union as the first step in the dismemberment of the 
country -- and evidence that perestroika is consequently failing. 
</P>
<P>
The apparently analogous loss of Eastern Europe as the Soviet Union's buffer 
with the West might have been a major political and military setback -- Moscow 
contended that it was not -- but the psychological impact was relatively small 
since most people here, in fact, welcomed those changes. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania's secession is different. This is Soviet territory that would be 
lost, and it is Soviet security that will be directly diminished by this gap in 
its defenses. This is Soviet socialism that was overwhelmingly rejected in 
Lithuania's parliamentary elections, and this is Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet 
reformer, whose vision of a better future for the country inspires no hope in 
Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania's secession, in this context, would have the effect of validating the 
criticism of Gorbachev and perestroika that is accumulating so steadily. And, 
with discussion about a possible military takeover now relatively commonplace 
in Moscow and other Soviet cities, though such talk is totally speculative, the 
question would be whether the army -- were it to replace the party in running 
the country -- would have tolerated the secession. 
</P>
<P>
The point is not that Lithuania, with its 3.6 million people, would be such a 
great loss for the Soviet Union, whose population is now nearly 290 million, 
nor that the small republic's agricultural output and production of electronic 
goods are essential to the Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is the point that perestroika hinges on the future of Lithuania. The 
crucial test for Gorbachev's reforms remains that of the shop shelves: how soon 
perestroika will improve the supplies of food and consumer goods, how soon it 
will redeem its promises of a better life. 
</P>
<P>
What Lithuania would become in its secession is a point of acute political 
vulnerability on which Gorbachev would have difficulty defending himself. His 
low-key response Monday to the Lithuanian action -- criticism and then a call 
for legislative assessment -- reflected his need not to focus attention on the 
likely breakup of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev himself, however, had told the Lithuanians during a visit there in 
January that his fate was now tied to their decision on whether to remain part 
of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader's options are few. 
</P>
<P>
At considerable political risk, he had committed his prestige in December to an 
unsuccessful attempt to persuade the Lithuanians not to quit. He has offered 
them maximum autonomy, political as well as economic, within a restructured 
federal system. He has borrowed many of their ideas for reforms for the country 
as a whole. He has met repeatedly with Lithuanian Communist Party officials and 
other leaders from the republic. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of these efforts has already diminished his political position, and 
further inducements appear likely to fail. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has tried more recently to discourage Lithuania with demands that it 
repay about $34 billion in investments and other debts to central government if 
it leaves. He has warned that trade between Lithuania and the Soviet Union 
would have to be put on a dollar basis at terms unfavorable to Lithuania. And 
he has even talked of those wanting to retain their Soviet citizenship leaving 
Lithuania, and Lithuanians in the Soviet Union being asked to move back. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanians feel that he might use the greater powers that he is likely to 
receive later this week as the Soviet Union's first executive president to 
declare a state of emergency, suspend the new Lithuanian government and take 
over administration of the republic himself. 
</P>
<P>
This would probably help restore Gorbachev's domestic image as a strong, 
resolute and decisive leader, one able to cope with the array of crises 
confronting the country. 
</P>
<P>
Short of force, however, Gorbachev has little leverage, certainly not to bring 
a total Lithuanian retreat, and he long ago ruled out the use of force in favor 
of political solutions to the country's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev also seems to lack the will to take such action, even though the 
political cost to him of Lithuania's secession might be even greater than the 
criticism he would encounter abroad if he intervenes. 
</P>
<P>
This leaves him pursuing his economic reforms at a faster pace in anticipation 
that they will soon show results here, promoting his political reforms in the 
hope that somehow they will satisfy both right and left and -- using Lithuania 
as an object lesson -- accelerating the restructuring of the Soviet Union's 
federal system.

SUMMER-LIKE HEAT TAKES EARLY BOW IN EAST, MIDWEST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Winter-weary Easterners and Midwesterners shucked their parkas and strolled 
outdoors in shirt sleeves Monday as summer-like heat defrosted the Snow Belt 
and broke or tied records in more than 50 cities. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures soared into the upper 80s and low 90s along the Atlantic Coast. In 
Washington, D.C., the thermometer surged to 89 degrees, surpassing the old 
record for the day by 14 degrees. Nearby Baltimore sweltered at an incredible 
92. Richmond, Va., and Augusta, Ga., reached 88. 
</P>
<P>
The high of 67 at La Crosse, Wis., broke a record set in 1877. Most of the 
records were in the 60s and 70s. 
</P>
<P>
The record-setting heat stretched from Sioux City, Iowa, east to Atlantic City 
and from Minneapolis south to Greenville and Spartanburg, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
The premature summer weather is expected to entice the famous cherry trees 
along the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C., into full bloom by Thursday, five 
days ahead of the previous record, National Park Service scientist William 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
That is bad news for organizers of the annual Cherry Blossom Festival, 
scheduled for early April. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Brady of the National Weather Service in Washington said that the record 
heat was caused by a very warm southwesterly flow of air around a surface 
high-pressure system centered to the southeast of the region. 
</P>
<P>
He called the unseasonal weather a "little scary" and said it was expected to 
remain unbroken at least through today. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was convinced, however, that the heat wave meant winter was gone 
for good. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the Poconos, and we could see snow on Easter Sunday," said Joe Pipolo, 
owner of an auto detailing business in the mountains of northeastern 
Pennsylvania. "March and April could be freaky months still." 
</P>
<P>
In ordinarily wintry Illinois, the unusual weather resulted in more than 2 
inches of weekend rains that were still causing havoc as the workweek began. 
</P>
<P>
A flash-flood watch was canceled just before dawn, but more than 200 people 
remained evacuated from their east-central Illinois homes because of flooding 
along the Vermillion River that floated mobile homes off their moorings. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported, but Interstate Water Co. in Danville was unable to 
pump water from the river. The private utility asked customers to conserve 
water and boil whatever they used. A shelter at a nearby grade school was 
housing those flooded out in the villages of Alvin and Bismarck. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered thunderstorms were expected through today in Oklahoma, where up to 5 
inches of weekend rain forced more than 30 people from their homes in Skiatook 
and routed about 20 people in Bartlesville and 15 in Guthrie. 
</P>
<P>
Rain continued in North Texas, where torrential thunderstorms Sunday led to at 
least one death. Paul Cooley, 13, drowned Sunday night after falling into a 
rain-swollen creek in Trophy Club.

BOTH SIDES IN BUS STRIKE MILES APART; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: THE UNION AND COMPANY ARE PURSUING DIVERSE PUBLIC STRATEGIES. GREYHOUND 
CHAIRMAN DOES NOT EXPECT A SETTLEMENT SOON.

<P>
The two sides in the Greyhound bus strike were hundreds of miles apart Monday, 
both literally and figuratively, symbolizing the different public strategies 
they are pursuing in the stalemated, 11-day-old dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The leader of Greyhound's 9,000 striking workers was in Washington at the 
request of the director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, who 
is trying to rekindle contract negotiations that ended when the strike began. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound's chairman, meanwhile, was in Florida, offering a $25,000 reward for 
information about a sniper attack on a Greyhound bus and pouring cold water on 
the suggestion that the strike can be settled soon. 
</P>
<P>
Fred G. Currey, chairman of Greyhound Lines Inc. -- the man strikers are 
referring to when they chant "Drop dead Fred" -- is taking the hard line. He 
has expressed little interest in help from a federal mediator, boasts he has 
accumulated a strike war chest of tens of millions of dollars to absorb a long 
walkout and claims he will soon make the strikers irrelevant by permanently 
replacing them with strikebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
The Amalgamated Transit Union, meanwhile, has expressed every willingness to 
resume negotiations, portraying itself as a victim of "union-busting" and of 
deep wage cuts it endured in 1983 and 1987 contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Currey, who on Monday boarded a Greyhound bus in Jacksonville, Fla., where a 
sniper attack injured eight passengers Sunday night, told reporters that 
Greyhound "will not raise fares to meet the exorbitant demands of the drivers . 
. . . We will not bend or move because of intimidation and violence." 
</P>
<P>
James LaSala, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union, spent three hours 
meeting with Bernard DeLury, director of the federal mediation service, which 
attempts to bring feuding parties in labor disputes together, although it has 
no power to compel discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound last week flatly refused a union request to resume talking, and a 
Greyhound spokesman said Monday "we're not certain" if the company would accept 
an invitation to talk to DeLury. Later in the day, however, the company 
announced that its chief negotiator, executive vice president P. Anthony 
Lannie, will meet with DeLury on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Unionized drivers and other workers, who took pay cuts of 7.8% in 1983 and 23% 
in 1987, are now demanding a four-year contract with a first-year raise 
estimated by various union officials at between 5% and 10% and annual raises of 
5% thereafter. Greyhound says it is offering a first-year increase of 6.9%. 
Each side characterizes the other's estimate as wildly inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
The union is demanding that Greyhound reinstitute pensions for newly hired 
drivers. It also strongly objects to Greyhound's proposal to delete the word 
"reasonable" from a clause limiting the kinds of employee-conduct rules the 
company can introduce. 
</P>
<P>
While Greyhound said early in the strike that it would restore much of its 
service by the end of the month using replacement workers, it has so far hired 
only 1,107, compared to a union force of 6,000 drivers. It is running only 33% 
of its normal departures. Service in its western division actually dropped over 
the weekend, to 27% of normal Sunday from 29% Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
At the company's Los Angeles terminal, long lines of bleary-eyed travelers 
continue to wait in a line that is still served by only one clerk. On Monday 
during a noisy demonstration here by 100 drivers and members of other unions, a 
woman who identified herself as a regular Greyhound rider emerged from the 
terminal to cheer the strikers on. 
</P>
<P>
Wanda Lipscomb of Los Angeles said she takes a Greyhound bus monthly to the 
California Correctional Training Facility at Soledad east of Monterey to visit 
her husband, an inmate. It usually takes six hours but the trip that began 
Sunday evening took 12 hours, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lipscomb said that she and other passengers were forced to stand during the 
trip because Greyhound sold too many seats -- a problem the company admits is 
occurring because of the limited number of buses. She also said that the driver 
lost his way and had to ask riders for directions. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a nightmare in there," Lipscomb said. "They sell people tickets 
and they don't have the room." 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound's threat to permanently replace strikers with replacement drivers is 
complicated by the fact that the strike was called on grounds of unfair labor 
practices, rather than simple economics. 
</P>
<P>
The National Labor Relations Board is currently reviewing a complaint by the 
union that Greyhound conducted its pre-strike bargaining in bad faith, making 
contract demands that no union could accept. Federal labor laws say that after 
a strike ends, strikers must be returned to their jobs and replacement workers 
terminated if their employer is found to have committed unfair labor practices. 
</P>
<P>
The NLRB general counsel's office has yet to rule on the union's complaint and 
a similar bad-faith complaint filed by Greyhound against the union. 
</P>
<P>
There have been scattered violent incidents since the strike began, including a 
striker crushed to death by a bus operated by a replacement driver in Redding, 
Calif., and shots fired at buses in Chicago and Phoenix. A Greyhound bus in 
Connecticut was hit by sniper fire Monday. No one was injured in the shooting, 
which occurred on Interstate 84 shortly before 11 a.m. as a New York-to-Boston 
Greyhound bus headed into Hartford with 19 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
An executive board member of the Jacksonville union local said he did not 
believe strikers were behind Sunday night's Florida shooting, in which someone 
fired a bullet through the front of a Greyhound bus. The passengers were 
injured by fiberglass and shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, it wasn't one of our strikers," Bill Nicholson said. 
"They've been like choirboys."

MONGOLIAN LEADER OFFERS TO RESIGN; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNISM: THE PRESIDENT TELLS HIS PARTY IT MUST REFORM. HIS OUSTER WAS A KEY 
DEMAND OF NEW OPPOSITION GROUPS.

<P>
Mongolian President Jambyn Batmonh submitted a sweeping program of political 
reform at a Communist Party meeting in Ulan Bator on Monday, including an offer 
of his own resignation as party leader. 
</P>
<P>
In a somber speech to the party's Central Committee, broadcast live on 
state-run television, Batmonh proposed that he and the entire ruling Politburo 
resign and that the party hold a special congress April 10 to elect new 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"To change the party, we should change the leadership of the party by choosing 
clever, constructive people committed to (economic and political) 
restructuring," Batmonh said. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee is expected to accept the resignations of Batmonh and 
others today, according to reports from Ulan Bator. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear, however, whether Batmonh, 63, or the six other voting and two 
non-voting Politburo members might keep their party posts on a temporary basis 
until next month's party congress, or whether they might run for reelection at 
the April meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Batmonh's resignation from the Politburo would not automatically affect his 
status as president, which derives from his position as head of the national 
legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation of top leaders of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, 
as the Communists are officially known, has been a key demand of Mongolia's 
fledgling opposition since last month, when the country's first opposition 
party, the Mongolian Democratic Party, was formed. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Saturday, according to a resident of Ulan Bator contacted 
by telephone from Beijing, the head of the opposition Mongolian Democratic 
Assn., Sanjaasuren Zorig, said that so long as the ruling party's Politburo 
goes through the act of resigning, the opposition can accept the reelection of 
some members. 
</P>
<P>
Batmonh, in an apparent step toward permitting the country's first multi-party 
elections, proposed Monday that the Mongolian legislature, known as the Great 
People's Hural, meet March 21 to pass a new election law. Conceding to yet 
another opposition demand, Batmonh also said that national elections, due in 
1991, should be moved forward to this year. 
</P>
<P>
Other steps proposed by Batmonh, according to another Ulan Bator resident 
reached from Beijing, include: 
</P>
<P>
Eliminating a constitutional provision stipulating that the Mongolian People's 
Revolutionary Party is the leading force in society. 
</P>
<P>
Later revising the entire constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Establishing a commission on rehabilitation of people formerly labeled as 
anti-party elements. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Mongolian dissidents began pressuring the government for political 
change with a series of rallies starting in December, the government has 
responded with a conciliatory stance. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the ruling party and four opposition groups issued a joint 
declaration pledging themselves to work for fair elections and democratic 
socialism, according to a dispatch from Ulan Bator by the Soviet news agency 
Tass. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition signatories included the Mongolian Democratic Party, the Mongolian 
Social Democratic Party, the Mongolian Democratic Assn. and the Union of 
Mongolian Students. 
</P>
<P>
The Communists and the opposition agreed that "their main aim is the well-being 
of Mongolia, the creation of humane democratic socialism . . . and the 
preservation of national identity," the Tass report said. 
</P>
<P>
"The declaration states that the ability of Mongolia's political parties and 
forces to represent public interests should be determined through fair and 
democratic election to the state bodies," it added. 
</P>
<P>
Batmonh renewed pledges of multi-party cooperation Monday, but he also warned 
the opposition not to push too hard. 
</P>
<P>
"The party should continue to oppose enemies of the people," he said. "The 
Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party will fight against those who are enemies 
of the people and those making extremist organizations." 
</P>
<P>
The mood in the Mongolian capital Monday was calm, with no major rallies, but 
many citizens appeared to be following political developments with high 
interest, a resident reported. 
</P>
<P>
Mongolia, with a population of 2 million, has been Communist-ruled since 1921, 
making it the second-oldest Communist state in the world, next to the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Mongolia has a rich history. Home to the Huns who ravaged China (1st-5th 
centuries), it produced its most famous conqueror in Genghis Khan (circa 
1162-1227). He forged one of the greatest empires of all time. After the Mongol 
dynasty faltered in the 1600s, China took control. In 1911, the Chinese 
governor was ousted by Mongol princes, who declared Mongolia autonomous. 
Chinese and Russian forces reconquered it but were finally repulsed in 1921, 
when it became an independent state. The Mongolian People's Republic emerged 
three years later as a Soviet-allied Communist regime. It occupies more than 
half the area historically known as Mongolia; the rest is in China.

China's Communist Party laid out a plan for its political survival at the end 
of a four-day Central Committee plenum in Beijing. The party was urged to unite 
with the masses and was told it has become separated from the people because of 
"bureaucracy, subjectivism, formalism, passivism, corruption and other serious 
phenomena," the official New China News Agency reported. Diplomats described 
the statement as a return to language inspired by Chairman Mao Tse-tung during 
the 1960s, when people did not dare challenge the authority of the party.

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's bid for greater powers to overcome the Soviet 
Union's deepening economic crisis drew sharp criticism Monday from opposition 
members of Parliament, who warned he could quickly become a dictator. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the move to amend the constitution and elect Gorbachev to the new post 
a "gross and grave mistake," radical historian Yuri N. Afanasyev said the 
Inter-Regional Group of Deputies believes that fundamental constitutional 
reforms should be undertaken first to ensure the country's democratic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which has the support of more than 400 members of the Congress of 
People's Deputies, is threatening to vote against the amendments or simply 
boycott a vote today, thereby endangering adoption of the measure by the 
required two-thirds of the 2,250 deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the amendments would be followed today or Wednesday by Gorbachev's 
election by the deputies to an initial four-year term. In the future, 
presidents will be chosen directly in nationwide elections for five-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing now is in reality legitimizing the personal power of a 
specific man, Mikhail Gorbachev," Afanasyev told the Congress, the Soviet 
Union's national Parliament. "Do we need this? Does the country need this? Does 
he himself need this? Our current difficulties are not due to a lack of power 
but to a lack of trust in it." 
</P>
<P>
The Inter-Regional Group of Deputies, which has come to function as a virtual 
opposition party in the Parliament, wants the Soviet constitution rewritten 
entirely before a strengthened presidency is created. It also believes that 
Parliament's powers must be increased as a check on the executive and that the 
new federal structure be developed to assure the rights of the country's 
constituent republics. 
</P>
<P>
Afanasyev went further, however, arguing that the abuse of power by previous 
Soviet leaders -- V. I. Lenin, the Bolshevik who founded the Soviet state, as 
well as dictator Josef Stalin, who succeeded him -- should be a warning against 
the creation of a strong presidency. 
</P>
<P>
"If our leader and founder laid the foundations of anything," Afanasyev said, 
shouting over the objections of other deputies in a rare public attack on 
Lenin, "it was the institutionalization of a policy of mass violence and 
terror. He also initiated the rule of lawlessness as state policy. This was 
true throughout the Stalin period. It brought many victims." 
</P>
<P>
But other reformers, who were the first to propose that a "strong hand" guide 
the nation through its current multiple crises, supported the constitutional 
amendments as the only way to ensure action, particularly on economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
"The economy is simply going to the dogs," Nikolai P. Shmelev, a prominent 
liberal economist, told other deputies. "We are now living in a lunatic asylum, 
and we are living by its rules." 
</P>
<P>
Shmelev, who again called for bold government actions such as encouragement of 
private enterprise and extensive foreign borrowings to reverse the country's 
downward economic spiral, dismissed arguments that the new presidency would be 
too powerful; the proposed legislation contains guarantees against 
dictatorship, he said, and the Congress itself would remain the ultimate 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
The case for the new presidency, which will give Gorbachev powers roughly akin 
to those of the U.S. and French presidents, was made largely on the basis of 
what Sergei S. Alexeyev, chairman of the Committee for Constitutional 
Compliance, called "a paralysis of power" in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Due to the withdrawal of the Communist Party from day-to-day management of the 
government and the economy as well as its broad loss of authority, the 
traditional political structures have lost most of their power -- and state 
bodies have not yet acquired it, Alexeyev said. 
</P>
<P>
"In these conditions, the presidency is the only effective measure to transfer 
power from the party structures to state bodies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anatoly I. Lukyanov, Gorbachev's deputy, sought to reassure the deputies on how 
much power the Soviet leader would have and what checks there would be on it. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no grounds whatsoever for the suspicions, kindled by some people, 
that the institution of the post of president allegedly leads to the 
establishment of authoritarian personal power," he said. "The proposed bill 
contains a whole system of guarantees against trends of this kind."

<P>
The first Soviet soldiers to leave Hungary under a withdrawal agreement signed 
over the weekend boarded a train for home Monday as a military band played the 
two countries' national anthems in a small town west of Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters from the pro-democracy Federation of Young Democrats held a small 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
They waved signs saying, "Hurry Home to the Sunshine in Azerbaijan," referring 
to the southern republic where troops were sent to restore order, and "Go Home 
as Quickly as You Came," referring to the 1956 Soviet invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed in Moscow, two-thirds of the 49,700 Soviet troops in 
Hungary are to be out by the end of this year. All the troops are scheduled to 
be gone by June 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 troops boarded the train here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Village Council President Ferenc Horvath said the entire population is glad to 
see them gone. "Our village had been like a front-line settlement for decades," 
he said. Billboards and power poles throughout the country have been plastered 
with posters showing the back of a stiff-necked Soviet officer with the Russian 
inscription: "Comrades, that's the end."

A STORMY ALLIANCE FROM THE START; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: L.A.'S $6.75-MILLION "LOAN" MADE SOME PEOPLE NERVOUS IN THE BEGINNING. 
THINGS WENT DOWNHILL FROM THERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It has been a tortuous marriage, fraught with discord. Indeed, the troubles 
dogging this star-crossed couple began even before vows were exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission wanted a football team, and the 
Oakland Raiders were willing to entertain a proposal. But the dowry -- a 
"loan," later revealed to be a gift, of $6.75 million to the team -- seemed 
steep at the time. While many civic leaders called this a modest price to pay 
to lure a professional football franchise to town, others were critical. 
</P>
<P>
Ardor, however, won out over pessimism, and the engagement was sealed. On Aug. 
29, 1982, the Los Angeles Raiders played their first game at the Coliseum, 
trouncing the Green Bay Packers, 24-3, in an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
The debut should have been a cause for celebration. Instead, it may have been 
an omen: There were 13,362 no-shows at the game -- and no standing ovation. 
Fullback Kenny King tried feebly to make the best of it: "We were expecting 
more fans to show up, but maybe they had other things to do." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Oakland officials announced that the Raiders plan to leave the 
Southland and return to their former home on the shores of San Francisco Bay. 
The decision caps a decade-long battle between the defiant and ornery Raiders 
owner, Al Davis, and a city that could never do enough to make him feel 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there were times of glory. The Raiders made the playoffs in their 
first two seasons in the Coliseum, and were Super Bowl champions in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
But more often the gritty team's stay in Los Angeles was clouded by acrimony, 
lawsuits and unrelenting verbal warfare between the intractable Davis and the 
often procrastinating and changeable Coliseum Commission. The lingering 
question is why. 
</P>
<P>
Some explanations undoubtedly relate to the team's fan appeal. The Raiders of 
the 1980s were not faring as well as their predecessors had, and were not as 
popular in cosmopolitan Los Angeles as they had been in blue-collar Oakland. In 
their very first year in Los Angeles, the Raiders ranked 22nd out of 28 
National Football League teams in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
But at the heart of the conflict, it seems, was Davis' assertion that a promise 
that drew him to Los Angeles was never kept by those who wooed him. Davis 
insists that the commission pledged to substantially renovate the aging 
Coliseum, making it a far better stadium to view football. 
</P>
<P>
While this issue was a thorny one from the start, relations truly turned sour 
in the spring of 1987, when then-Commission President Alexander Haagen insisted 
that no such promise had been made. Haagen said the team's Dec. 8, 1984, 
contract with the Coliseum made no reference to a renovation promise and added 
that no oral agreement had been struck. 
</P>
<P>
A former commissioner who had been instrumental in reaching the initial deal 
with Davis, labor leader William Robertson, rebutted Haagen, saying the 
renovation promises were made. Another former commissioner, former state Sen. 
William Campbell, and Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley also supported Davis' 
version of events. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the dispute, Haagen's commission in 1987 passed a policy 
statement of intent to undertake renovations that year. But Haagen later said 
there was neither the time nor the money to do so; still later, he asserted 
that no bank would finance renovations without a commitment by Davis to extend 
his Coliseum lease beyond 1991. Davis, Haagen charged, was never willing to 
make such a commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Such contentions angered Davis who unleashed a torrent of criticism. Once, 
citing commissioners' failure to keep their word, he even compared them to 
Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
Fed up with the commission's procrastinating, Davis began shopping for a new 
playing site. And soon he found one in suburban Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
Irwindale, however, proved incapable of finding either the financing or the 
site for a new stadium. So, gradually, Davis extended his explorations to both 
Sacramento and Oakland, where officials seemed anxious to make him ever more 
extravagant offers. 
</P>
<P>
Coliseum authorities responded to Davis' vow to leave by suing the team for at 
least $57 million for breach of contract and other alleged derelictions. 
Commission attorney Marshall Grossman said last week that in the wake of an 
Oakland move, the suit will be pursued with vigor and more counts may be added 
to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of some observers, the Raiders' stay in Los Angeles was cursed from 
the start. The $6.7-million "loan" offered to draw Davis south sparked a 
political furor, a furor that grew once it was revealed that Davis was not 
obligated to repay the funds. 
</P>
<P>
"Did we have to be so generous?" City Councilman John Ferraro asked in 1982, 
looking back on the controversial financial enticement. "I don't mind someone 
driving a hard bargain . . . (but) what good is it to drive your partner to the 
poorhouse?" 
</P>
<P>
Though they made the playoffs during their first two seasons in Los Angeles, 
the Raiders' success was overshadowed by the 1984 Olympics. Olympic organizers 
were zealous about preventing any Coliseum reconstruction that could possibly 
spoil it for their Games. In 1983, Davis postponed luxury box construction at 
the Coliseum after the Olympic Organizing Committee asked for a $50,000-a-day 
fine if it were not completed two months before the Games began. 
</P>
<P>
By 1987, the year open conflict erupted between Davis and the commission over 
what to do to improve the Coliseum, the Raiders' popularity and clout were 
already fading. Even Mayor Bradley, while ostensibly on Davis' side, refused to 
commit his influence in a decisive way in the crisis that preceded the 
Irwindale announcement. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, mutual bad feelings have been unrelenting. Even in the last 
few months, when both Davis and the commissioners swallowed their pride and 
resumed conversations over a possible deal that would have kept the team in Los 
Angeles, insults continued to be exchanged behind the scenes, and the Raiders 
continued to be very late in paying their rent. 
</P>
<P>
While anti-Davis forces say the team owner's contentiousness and inflexibility 
prevented fruitful negotiations, blame has also been laid at the doorstep of 
the Coliseum Commission. A nine-member body with three members each 
representing the city, the county and the state, the commission is staffed with 
separate attorneys from each level of government and has long been extremely 
slow to act. Appointments of or by different elected officials has led to 
frequent sharp divisions within the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, of course, are not the first team to leave the Coliseum or the 
adjacent Sports Arena. Over the last quarter-century, the Rams, the Kings, the 
Lakers and UCLA, as well as several less well-known teams, have all moved, 
usually blaming the commission for lack of responsiveness to their needs. 
</P>
<P>
Even USC, the complex's oldest tenant, frequently has complained that the 
commission doesn't care as much as it should about its needs. The commission, 
for instance, has often thought nothing about notifying USC to play some of its 
home basketball games outside the Sports Arena when it believed that a more 
desirable event, such as a circus, was available. 
</P>
<P>
Turnover of commissioners has led to inconsistency of approach. Robertson once 
said the situation illustrated "why the Al Davises of this world don't like to 
deal with politicians. When an election comes along, the new officials 
conveniently forget what the old officials said. They just ignore what's been 
promised." 
</P>
<P>
There was a new round of criticism of the commission after Davis announced his 
move to Irwindale, and several officials, led by Bradley, suggested privatizing 
the Coliseum, leasing it to private managers and letting them run it in a more 
orderly, and hopefully, profitable way. 
</P>
<P>
After long negotiations, nine months after the Irwindale announcement, the 
commission did retain private managers, but it stopped short of leasing the 
facilities to them. The managers believed that their authority had been so 
diluted that when they began negotiating last year with Davis, they could do 
little on their own. Frequently, they couldn't even get the commission to meet 
to give them instructions. 
</P>
<P>
As of last weekend, the failure to conclude a private lease was said by the 
lead negotiator, Ed Snider, to be keeping him from making a solid offer -- 
complete with a cash guarantee of performance -- to Davis. In fact, it had 
become apparent months before that if the Coliseum was to be improved with 
private money, it could only be done by private managers holding a long-term 
ground lease. 
</P>
<P>
Snider, while insisting that he had to get an OK on the lease during the 
weekend in order to go forward, said he did not want to be critical of the 
commission. One of his private management colleagues, Irving Azoff, 
representing MCA Inc., was not so reticent. He called the commission "the nine 
idiots." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN SEARCH OF A DEAL 
</P>
<P>
Oakland: Oakland is prepared to give the Raiders $59.9 million in "loans" as a 
franchise fee and put $53.5 million into expanding the Oakland-Alameda County 
Coliseum to 63,500 seats from its current 50,000. In addition, the Raiders 
would be guaranteed by the city and county $27.8 million in ticket revenues 
each year through the 15-year term of the lease, and would receive other 
revenue guarantees totaling $130 million more. The total value of the Oakland 
offer has been estimated at $660 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento: The Sacramento offer, which lapsed Feb. 28, included a $50-million 
franchise fee put up by the city of Sacramento, plus a $120-million stadium to 
be constructed by private entrepreneurs. Details as to divisions of ticket, box 
and concession revenues were not revealed. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles: The Los Angeles offer was never completed or revealed in great 
detail. But it included at least $70 million in initial payments and later 
guarantees of minimum annual payments to the Raiders, plus a $145-million 
Coliseum renovation, including construction of 200 luxury boxes and up to 
15,000 club seats. The main Los Angeles argument was that the Raiders would be 
able to collect more from the sale of luxury boxes and club seats in Los 
Angeles than they would in Oakland or elsewhere, so that even if Los Angeles 
was not offering as much cash at the outset, it would come later. 
</P>
<P>
Irwindale: The Irwindale offer of 1987 called for the city to make a 
$115-million loan to the Raiders with which they would construct a stadium that 
they would own and operate. The Raiders would have had to repay only $85 
million of the amount, the rest being in the nature of a franchise fee to the 
team. In addition, Irwindale was responsible for road and site preparation of 
up to $35 million, making it a $150-million package.

HARD-NOSED DAVIS KNOWS HOW TO WIN AT THE BARGAINING TABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL SAPPELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Al Davis, the controversial boss of the Los Angeles Raiders, has proved again 
that he lives by the singular standard he sets for his players -- "Just win, 
baby." 
</P>
<P>
A bruiser at the bargaining table, the Raiders owner has agreed to a 
$660-million deal with the city of Oakland to return the team to the site of 
its past glories. The announced agreement was reached after Davis had 
skillfully driven up the price for the Raiders during talks with Los Angeles, 
Irwindale and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his pro football career, Davis has distinguished himself as a 
maverick and bare-knuckled brawler who won't shirk from a fight, even when it 
appears he is overmatched. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, for example, when the National Football League tried to 
block the Raiders' move from Oakland to Los Angeles, Davis filed an 
unprecedented federal antitrust lawsuit against the league. He won. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old Brooklyn native rarely soft-peddles his thoughts. Commenting in 
the early 1980s on why he wanted to move from the Bay Area, Davis remarked: 
"The people I have to deal with in Oakland are a bunch of bastards." 
</P>
<P>
With his gruff demeanor, pompadour hairstyle and fondness for black suits and 
custom-made white shirts, Davis stirs strong -- and extreme -- assessments from 
those he has encountered in his professional life. 
</P>
<P>
Some have called him a genius, a compassionate man whose brains are matched 
only by his courage. But others have described him as a dictator, a master of 
manipulation, and a carpetbagger who will take his team wherever the money is 
best. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Stephen Reinhardt, who before being named to the judiciary 
was one of the local leaders who helped bring the Raiders to Los Angeles, 
contends that Davis has been widely misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
Reinhardt said that in his dealings Davis was "totally honest, ethical and 
straightforward." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Los Angeles Coliseum Commission President Richard Riordan 
has described Davis as odd, unresponsive and difficult. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Davis once said he considered it a compliment to be called 
"devious." "They've said of every great leader of my time that he's devious -- 
from Roosevelt and Churchill to Eisenhower, Kissinger and Mao," Davis said in a 
1980 interview with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Davis is the only person in the history of professional football to have been 
an assistant coach, head coach, general manager, league commissioner and team 
owner. He joined the then-Oakland Raiders in 1963 as head coach and general 
manager. At 33, he was the youngest person holding those jobs in professional 
football. 
</P>
<P>
He also made history in 1989 when he named Art Shell as football's first black 
head coach in the game's modern era. 
</P>
<P>
After the team won its only championship in Los Angeles in 1984 against the 
Washington Redskins, Davis was asked whether he was expecting to have routed 
the opposition. His answer said much of the man. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think in terms of rout," he said. "I think in terms of domination."

franchise: 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 18, 1980 -- Los Angeles Coliseum Commission discloses that Al Davis has

March 25 -- A Superior Court judge in Oakland issues an order blocking the 
Raiders move. 
</P>
<P>
May 7, 1982 -- A federal court jury in Los Angeles finds against the NFL and in

before 40,906 fans. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 5, 1983 -- Raiders delay construction of luxury boxes on the Coliseum rim 
until after the 1984 Olympics, after a demand from the Los Angeles Olympic 
Organizing Committee for a $50,000-a-day penalty if the boxes are not completed 
by June 1, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 22, 1984 -- Raiders win their only Super Bowl as a Los Angeles team,

</P>
<P>
Dec. 8 -- Davis signs a long-term contract with the Coliseum Commission 
committing the Raiders to staying in the facility at least through 1991, with 
options through 2006. The contract does not refer to any promises by the 
Coliseum Commission for stadium renovations. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 18, 1987 -- Raiders suspend once again their long-delayed construction of 
luxury boxes on the Coliseum rim, saying they will not build them unless the 
Coliseum Commission agrees first to undertake an $8-million to $15-million 
reconfiguration of regular seating. Davis insists that despite language in the 
1984 contract, this was promised to him. 
</P>
<P>
March 7 -- Commission President Alexander Haagen refuses to accede to Davis' 
demands, saying there is neither the money nor the time to do the seating 
reconfiguration "this year." 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 29 -- A Los Angeles Superior Court judge suspends Irwindale-Raiders 
agreement until an environmental impact report is prepared for the Irwindale 
stadium. This eventually takes more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 30 -- Coliseum Commission sues Raiders for at least $57 million for 
breach of contract.

definite site for the proposed stadium. 
</P>

exhibition game before a capacity crowd in the Oakland Coliseum with the 
Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 13 -- Sacramento City Council approves offering Raiders $50 million in 
municipal money to move to Sacramento. A $120-million stadium would be built by 
private entrepreneurs. The council says the offer will expire on Feb. 28, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 29 -- Los Angeles Coliseum representatives report offering Davis a 
Coliseum with 180 luxury boxes and 10,000 club seats, to be financed with

seats. 
</P>

reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 3, 1990 -- The Los Angeles offer is expanded to include $70 million in

questions arise about delays due to the need for environmental impact reports 
and historic preservation requirements. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
March 8 -- Oakland officials give Davis 24 hours to say yes or no to their

</P>
<P>
March 9 -- Oakland officials extend deadline by three days after Davis asks for 
more time.

health system crippled by a lack of money and a crack epidemic, and a downtown 
devastated by last fall's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
But Oakland, which has had more than its share of ills, finally had something 
to cheer about Monday -- the announced return of its treasured football team. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll boost everything -- make the city proud again," declared Anthony Davis, 
32, a city maintenance worker. 
</P>
<P>
In the downtown area, word spread quickly that Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson and 
Alameda County Supervisor Don Perata had announced that Al Davis would bring 
the Raiders "home." 
</P>
<P>
In the euphoria of the moment, many officials and football fans assumed that 
approval was a formality, as indeed it turned out to be. But a few sounded a 
note of caution, citing the potential that taxpayers would have to pay off the 
bonds used to raise money to refurbish the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are not sure that it's a good deal," said Assemblyman Elihu M. 
Harris (D-Oakland), a candidate for mayor. "The economics are marginal at best. 
The question is: Will the emotion win over the economics?" 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, some football fans aren't sure that Davis will win their loyalty 
quite so easily. Dante Polk, 21, and his friend, Mohumah Demiz, 22, recalled 
that as kids they would do whatever it took to see their team, including 
hopping the fences to get into the coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, if they opened the fence, I don't think I'd go," Demiz said. As he sees 
it, Davis used Oakland to win a good deal from Los Angeles, and is using 
Oakland again. "Oakland was true to the Raiders, but Al Davis was not true to 
Oakland," Demiz said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a return of the football team that gave the city its identity would 
"give people something to talk about other than crack," said Polk. As it is, 
when outsiders hear of Oakland, the news too often is of "thugs and drugs." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders left an area after the 1981 season that had given them years of 
sellout crowds. With a reputation for tough play and wild antics, the team was 
among the most successful franchises in sports history. 
</P>
<P>
"Al Davis developed a particular mystique -- the guy from the other side of the 
track who has to fight in order to survive, the underdog fighting his way to 
the top, fighting the establishment," noted Robert Nahas, former president of 
the Oakland-Alameda Coliseum Commission, who fought to keep the team here. 
</P>
<P>
That image played especially well in Oakland, which long fought to get out from 
the shadow of the more glamorous San Francisco. Although Davis left for Los 
Angeles, fans never gave up. 
</P>
<P>
Sports bars prospered by identifying with the team. A newsletter gave voice to 
the hope that the Raiders would return. Die-hards traveled 400 miles to watch 
their beloved team play in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For local officials, Nahas said, "it is a matter of ego. We lost it and we want 
it back." As for the fans, they're "longing for the most exciting team in 
football. They're hoping to see that again." 
</P>
<P>
If Davis carries through on his apparent pledge to return, he will face a very 
different and more competitive market. The San Francisco 49ers are the "Team of 
the '80s," having won the Super Bowl earlier this year, and three championships 
in the 1980s, while the Oakland A's are the baseball champions. 
</P>
<P>
The city also has gone through changes. It has experienced an erosion of 
blue-collar jobs, a trend expected to continue if the federal government 
follows through with its plan to close several military bases in the East Bay. 
Meanwhile, white-collar, service-oriented jobs have been on the upswing. 
</P>
<P>
The Oct. 17 earthquake caused $1.3 billion in damage in Oakland, forcing 
closure of 213 commercial buildings, many of them downtown. City Hall itself is 
closed. Fifteen residential hotels that housed some of the city's poorest 
residents also were shuttered. 
</P>
<P>
The Alameda County district attorney's office continues an investigation of 
low-level corruption at the Oakland school district, where 13 employees have 
been arrested. A top Alameda County health official estimated that the main 
public hospital needs $25 million to meet state standards. 
</P>
<P>
But while problems seem to have multiplied in the past year, Oakland business 
executives say they are bullish. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost by any measure, we are doing better than we were in 1981," said James 
A. Vohs, chairman and chief executive officer of Kaiser Foundation Health Plans 
Inc. "I think (the Raiders) are coming back to a healthier city." 
</P>
<P>
Davis will find a larger market than the one he left. Much of the growth in the 
Bay Area is taking place in the East Bay. Oakland's population, which is about 
350,000, is expected to grow by about 5% over the next 15 years. But adjacent 
Contra Costa County is expected to grow by 28%, and some Alameda County suburbs 
are expected to grow 32% to 74%, regional planners have said. 
</P>
<P>
If the National Football League franchise returns, Don Moroni can claim some 
credit. Through his newsletter, Sports Page News, he gathered 48,000 names on 
petitions demanding that officials enter into talks with Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Moroni, who owns a printing company, recalled that when he began the campaign, 
"People laughed us out of the arena." They would say, " 'Al Davis is never 
coming back. You people are a joke.' " As he saw it, however, "it was a 
fundamental issue of representation." The fans had spoken and forced the 
officials to try to win back the team. "The Raiders belong here. The Raiders 
put Oakland on the map nationally." 
</P>
<P>
Whether Davis can reclaim that past glory remains to be seen. Milton Young, 
bartender at the Oakland sports bar, King's X, said he is not one of the fans 
who will pay for a game ticket that local officials say will average $55. 
</P>
<P>
"Davis is a guy who has everything going his own way," said Young, a 49ers fan. 
"I'd like to have someone tell him to take his team and stick it. . . . The 
people in Oakland are a little disgusted."

Gov. James J. Florio signed into law a bill to lower New Jersey's car insurance 
rates by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Allstate Insurance Co. Vice President Edward Young said the firm would file 
suit within 30 days on the grounds that the law violates constitutional 
protections of due process. New Jersey's insurance rates average $1,000 a year. 
The bill eliminates the Joint Underwriting Assn., a state-operated pool for 
high-risk drivers that has a $3.1-billion debt. A $222 per car annual tab to 
keep the pool from bankruptcy will be dropped. The law requires the insurance 
industry to pay $1.4 billion of the pool's debt.

DISABLED PERSONS RALLY, CRAWL UP CAPITOL STEPS; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: SCORES PROTEST DELAYS IN PASSAGE OF RIGHTS LEGISLATION. THE LOGJAM IN 
THE HOUSE IS EXPECTED TO BREAK SOON.

<P>
Crawling up the Capitol steps to dramatize the barriers confronting them, 
scores of disabled persons rallied Monday to protest delays in congressional 
action on a Senate-passed bill to expand their access to jobs, transportation 
and public services. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, endorsed by President Bush, has broad bipartisan backing but 
has been moving at glacial speed through four House committees since it was 
approved overwhelmingly by the Senate last September. 
</P>
<P>
"Two centuries is long enough for people with disabilities to wait before the 
constitutional promise of justice is kept," Justin W. Dart Jr., chairman of the 
President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities, told the 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have to come back, perhaps we'll simply stay until they pass (the 
bill)," said I. King Jordan, first deaf president of Gallaudet College for the 
deaf, hinting at a Capitol Hill camp-in for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the rally said disabled persons from 30 states, including many in 
wheelchairs, came to demand immediate action on the bill without any weakening 
amendments. 
</P>
<P>
At the close of the rally, when dozens left their wheelchairs to crawl to the 
Capitol entrance, spectators' attention focused on 8-year-old Jennifer Keelan 
of Denver, who propelled herself to the top of the steep stone steps using only 
her knees and elbows. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, sprawled on her back and inching ahead slowly, was Paulette Patterson, 
33, of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"I want my civil rights," Patterson said. "I want to be treated like a human 
being." 
</P>
<P>
Despite grumbling from rally-goers that the Bush Administration and Democratic 
leaders were relaxing their efforts on behalf of the measure, key advocates 
predicted the House logjam will be broken in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The House Energy and Commerce Committee is expected to approve its part of the 
legislation today, followed by similar action by the Public Works and Judiciary 
committees. Final House passage appears likely to occur by May. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, 
said the unusual lobbying effort would provide a "final push" to the 
legislation, which he forecast would clear the House with no more than 100 
votes against it. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration at the West Front of the Capitol had some of the fervor of a 
civil rights rally of the 1960s as the demonstrators chanted slogans and sang 
songs to underscore their message to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) made the comparison, telling the crowd: "What 
we did for civil rights in the 1960s we forgot to do for people with 
disabilities." 
</P>
<P>
Another member of Congress, Rep. Major R. Owens (D-N.Y.), said there are still 
threats to passage of the bill from conservative lawmakers and powerful 
business interests who oppose the legislation's provisions on disabled access 
to transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"All the i's have been dotted and all the t's have been crossed," Owens said. 
"There have been enough negotiations -- delay is the real enemy." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the Bush Administration, however, Chairman Evan J. Kemp Jr. of the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission denied any lack of enthusiasm by the 
White House. Kemp, who uses a wheelchair, said: "This Administration is more 
for the bill today than it was 14 months ago. . . . We have solidarity. 
Solidarity made Poland free; It can make us free, too." 
</P>
<P>
But James Brady, former press secretary to President Ronald Reagan, expressed 
impatience with Congress' rate of progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope these politicians are awake and listening. If not, we'll be back," said 
Brady, who was disabled when he was shot in the head during an attempt on 
Reagan's life. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh notified key members of the House that the 
Administration would seek a change in the Senate-passed bill to make clear that 
disabled persons who are willfully discriminated against would not be entitled 
to monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
The "clarifying amendment" will be introduced during the House Judiciary 
Committee's consideration of the bill this month, Thornburgh said, adding: "We 
will . . . continue to support expeditious passage of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act with this clarification."

"It was just horrible, terrible. To hear the brakes squeal, the gas tanks 
explode, to hear the people screaming," said Harry Suppanz, 35, of Sturgeon

A Fire Department spokesman said the building was evacuated after the collapse

Editor in Chief Zhang Li was sentenced to one year. Both sentences were

SIOUX CITY CRASH PROMPTS FAA ORDER TO ALTER DC-10S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration on Monday ordered air carriers to modify 
all DC-10 jetliners' hydraulic systems, hoping to make them less vulnerable to 
the kind of crippling accident that last year caused the fiery crash of a 
commercial aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA's order came in direct response to the July 19 destruction of a United 
DC-10 in Sioux City, Iowa. In that accident, the plane's tail engine exploded, 
severing the three independent hydraulic lines that powered all of its controls 
and sending the aircraft toward a cartwheeling crash landing that killed 112 of 
the 296 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the FAA said placing electronic shut-off valves and check 
valves in the hydraulic system "would keep the hydraulic fluid from leaking out 
in the event hydraulic lines in the tail are cut by flying debris, as was the 
case in last July's accident." 
</P>
<P>
Such a change, the statement said, would "preserve enough hydraulic power 
following damage to the system to enable the flight crew to safely fly and land 
the airplane," even if all three hydraulic lines were severed in the tail 
section. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA's order follows design changes recommended for the airliner by its 
manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas Corp., of St. Louis. It is likely to be given 
final approval after a period of public comment ending May 1, after which 
airlines would have six months to make the modifications in DC-10-10s and a 
year for all other DC-10 models. 
</P>
<P>
The DC-10-10 is the DC-10 model most widely in use for domestic flights. It is 
similar to McDonnell Douglas' five other design variants but has a 
comparatively shorter range, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The 130 DC-10-10s in service are first in line to be modified because "they 
are, unfortunately, the aircraft identified with the Sioux City accident," said 
Steve Swinney, a spokesman for Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas' Long 
Beach-based component that will coordinate the modification with the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas and the FAA estimate that the cost to modify each of the 243 
U.S.-registered DC-10s, including 59 KC-10s in use by the military, will be 
$25,000 to $29,000 per plane. The FAA expects foreign aircraft authorities to 
follow its example in ordering the modification of the 185 foreign-registered 
DC-10s in service. 
</P>
<P>
United Capt. Alfred C. Haynes, the pilot during the Sioux City disaster who is 
widely credited for having saved the lives of most passengers aboard, has told 
investigators that the only way he had been able to turn the plane was by 
increasing the thrust of one of the wing-mounted engines and decreasing it in 
the other. However, he recalled, the plane had been sapped of hydraulic fluid 
and had no way to get its nose up. 
</P>
<P>
With the FAA's proposal for less vulnerable hydraulics, the pilot of a DC-10 
suffering comparable damage still would lose control of most of the 
tail-mounted controls -- the rudder, which turns the airliner, and the 
elevators, which help control climb and descent. 
</P>
<P>
But other controls, such as the wing-mounted ailerons that allow the pilot to 
keep the plane level, would remain operable, the FAA said. So would the wing 
flaps, which primarily slow the aircraft when landing. 
</P>
<P>
Also, if the system controlling the horizontal stabilizer trims in the plane's 
tail was left intact, the FAA said, the crew could control the angle and rate 
of descent. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA already is under way with an ultrasonic inspection for possible 
microscopic defects in DC-10 engine fan disks.

NEW MINORITY CENSUS GUIDELINES SCORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Responding to concerns that minorities will be undercounted in the 1990 census, 
the Department of Commerce on Monday issued a set of streamlined guidelines to 
be used next year for determining whether a special count of blacks, Latinos 
and other groups would be incorporated as a part of the Census Bureau's final 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
Michael R. Darby, undersecretary of commerce, said the department made 
"substantial revisions" to the guidelines first proposed for making adjustments 
in the census. He claimed the new guidelines would "ensure the 1990 census is 
the most accurate population count that can be practically produced." 
</P>
<P>
However, attorneys for Los Angeles and New York City quickly labeled the new 
guidelines "a disgrace" and threatened another round of court battles to force 
the department to scrap them. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles and New York filed a lawsuit last year to force the Census Bureau 
to take extra steps to count minorities, who typically have been undercounted. 
A July, 1989, settlement of the suit requires the bureau to conduct a random 
survey of 150,000 minority households -- historically harder to find using 
normal methods -- after completing the traditional mail census on April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the two cities had also attacked an earlier round of 
guidelines, proposed last December, that outlined the circumstances under which 
the random survey would be used. Their protests helped prompt the Census 
Bureau's revisions. 
</P>
<P>
But lead attorneys involved in the suit complained the new guidelines still 
give the commerce secretary too much discretion to reject the post-census 
survey, even if it produces a more accurate count of the nation's population. 
Los Angeles city attorneys said they would issue a statement today about the 
department's announcement, but declined comment until they more closely studied 
the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Peter L. Zimroth, senior partner with the New York office of Arnold &amp; 
Porter, and special counsel to the cities involved in the lawsuit, said the 
revised guidelines are an effort by the Bush Administration to use the census 
for political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"These guidelines are a disgrace," he said. "They're every bit as bad as the 
old proposals." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Zimroth criticized the revised proposal that allows the 
secretary to "take into account the potential disruption" of the revised count 
on congressional redistricting. "By doing that," he charged, "they have 
signaled their willingness to make the census a political act." 
</P>
<P>
Critics also complained about another provision in the new guidelines allowing 
the secretary to reject the post-census survey results "if sufficient data and 
analysis of the data are not available in time to publish adjusted counts by 
July 15, 1991." 
</P>
<P>
Department officials have said they would not make a decision on whether to use 
the minority household surveys before that date, and have expressed doubts they 
could be finished in time for the April 1, 1991, deadline for releasing data to 
the states for apportionment and redistricting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Rolnick, an attorney with Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, co-counsel for the 
cities, said the secretary's responsibilities should extend no further than 
ensuring the census is conducted in the most accurate way possible.

National Semiconductor Corp.: The computer chip maker said it lost $10.2 
million in its third quarter, compared to a $44.6-million loss in the same 
period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Sales rose 6.6% to $404.3 million. The Santa Clara, Calif., firm said the third 
quarter "is historically a challenging one for us, incorporating a seasonal 
slowdown in sales, along with the annual holiday shutdown of our production 
facilities." The results were helped by the reversal of $4.6 million in 
one-time costs originally set aside to pay for the closing of a Danbury, Conn., 
plant. The firm also had $6.7 million in non-recurring credits.

VONS REBOUNDS WITH $3-MILLION FIRST-QUARTER PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vons Cos. on Monday posted its first quarterly profit in more than a year, 
rebounding from difficulties that have beset the supermarket company since it 
bought Safeway's Southern California stores in August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter of 1989, Vons reported net income of $3 million on sales 
that climbed 5.7% to $1.24 billion. A year earlier, the company lost $16.2 
million during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to be out of the woods and gaining momentum," said Jonathan Ziegler, 
an analyst with the investment firm Sutro &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, for all of 1989, Vons' losses deepened to $25.1 million on sales that 
rose 33% to $5.2 billion. In 1988, the El Monte-based company lost $23.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the yearlong shortfall stemmed from unexpectedly high one-time charges 
of $23.8 million, including $11.1 million in the fourth quarter. The charges 
covered, among other things, the cost of meshing the Vons and Safeway 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Vons also is saddled with high interest payments for $839 million in debt, much 
of it from the $408-million acquisition of 162 Safeway stores 19 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler said he was encouraged, however, by sales gains at the former Safeway 
stores as well as at Vons' other operations. In 1989, sales were up 9.7% at the 
acquired stores and 4.3% at other Vons outlets open more than one year. 
</P>
<P>
The company, the leading supermarket concern in Southern California with a 
market share of roughly 25%, operates stores under the Vons, Pavilions, 
Pavilions Place and Tianguis names. It did not break out results for the 
individual chains. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement released through Vons' headquarters in El Monte, 
Chairman and Chief Executive Roger E. Stangeland said the company has shown 
improvement every quarter since it acquired the Southern California Safeway 
stores. "These strong fourth-quarter results verify that we have turned the 
corner on the integration process," he said. "With the integration project 
substantially complete, we look forward to continuing improvement in 1990 and 
beyond." 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock, which has climbed since hovering in the $18-$19 range for 
most of February, rose another 25 cents Monday to close at $21.75 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Other supermarket chains also have reported strong results recently. Ziegler 
attributed the industrywide gains to improved management, and said that 
supermarkets may be taking away some business from restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Salt Lake City-based American Stores, which owns the Lucky and Alpha Beta 
stores in Southern California along with other chains across the country, on 
Monday reported that its fourth-quarter earnings more than doubled to $53.1 
million from $20.2 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Sales climbed 14% to $6.1 billion. Also, American's fourth quarter included 14 
weeks in 1989 versus 13 weeks in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
For the year, American's earnings rose 20.2% to $118.1 million on sales that 
climbed 19.1% to $22.0 billion.

LOCKHEED MACHINISTS WALK OUT IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 machinists union members at Lockheed Corp.'s aircraft service 
subsidiary walked off their jobs Monday at four maintenance facilities in San 
Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Members in Local Lodge 821 of the International Assn. of Machinists and 
Aerospace Workers voted to strike after rejecting a proposal by Lockheed 
Aircraft Service Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Workers began picketing Monday morning outside the company's Upland, Chino and 
two Ontario facilities. A total of 2,500 employees perform regular maintenance 
and modification work at the four sites for the Air Force and Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed spokesman John Daily said the facilities were continuing to operate 
with salaried and supervisory employees. 
</P>
<P>
Union representative Bob Gregory said the company's offer was inferior to the 3 
1/2-year pact accepted last week by 18,000 machinists at Lockheed manufacturing 
plants in Burbank, Sunnyvale, Calif., and Marietta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Gregory said highly skilled workers at the Burbank plant were 
given a 4% wage increase and a $2,500 signing bonus. The San Bernardino 
members, he said, were offered a 3% increase and no signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
"We are dealing with a different lodge and with different issues," company 
spokesman Daily said, adding that company policy kept him from discussing its 
labor proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Company and union officials said there were no plans for further negotiations.

ORANGE COUNTY SUSPECTS NAMED IN CHIP THEFT RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men who allegedly headed a major crime ring based in Little Saigon in 
Orange County have been charged with stealing $3.7 million in computer chips, 
according to an indictment to be unsealed today in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments of Dinh Huu Tran, 33, of Santa Ana, and Phat Viet Doan, 20, of 
Garden Grove, stem from a 17-month interstate investigation by the Treasury 
Department and the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
The purported crime ring allegedly preyed on an American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph manufacturing facility in Oklahoma City, recruiting Vietnamese 
employees there to steal hundreds of thousands of chips by putting the precious 
parts in their pockets and in tubes that were hidden under their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
The chips were then transported to the Orange County area by car and commercial 
jet and fenced through at least 30 Vietnamese-owned computer stores, Treasury 
special agent Paul Elledge alleged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"They did business throughout Orange County," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged AT&amp;T theft is the latest evidence of a network of Vietnamese 
gangs -- many based in Orange County -- that have traveled around the nation 
stealing microchips. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the alleged thefts have been carried out like paramilitary operations. 
Bandits allegedly struck some of Southern California's best-known computer 
companies, binding and gagging employees and issuing death threats against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing is so massive now that federal agencies are finally looking 
seriously at it," said Lee Roberts, a Santa Ana private investigator employed 
by several computer giants. 
</P>
<P>
The Oklahoma City indictment claims that the thefts at AT&amp;T occurred 
between May, 1988, and January of last year. 
</P>
<P>
The two Orange County men are named in the indictment as the leaders of the 
crime ring, which Elledge said involved at least 16 people. Further indictments 
are expected. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Oklahoma City has scheduled a press conference 
today to announce the indictments and explain the complicated scheme. The 
indictments were originally filed last month but placed under seal to give 
local law enforcement officials a chance to find the two men. 
</P>
<P>
Tran, 33, and Doan, 20, are charged with conspiracy, interstate transportation 
of stolen goods and multiple counts of money laundering. The two, who each face 
135 years in jail if convicted, were last seen at Tet celebrations in Little 
Saigon at the end of January and are considered fugitives, Elledge said. 
</P>
<P>
Tran's attorney, Nolan Stringfield, refused to comment until he sees the 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't really much I can say at this point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged crime ring was first suspected by Internal Revenue Service agents 
in August, 1988, after they noticed that hundreds of thousands of dollars were 
being moved between Oklahoma City and Orange County. They suspected an illegal 
drug operation. 
</P>
<P>
"We normally investigate major narcotics cases," said Elledge. "We attempt to 
try and track the flow and movement of large amounts of currency. When we 
initially started this investigation, we thought it was probably 
narcotics-related because, based on our experience, the only thing we knew that 
could generate such large amounts of money over a short period of time was 
drugs. We were quite far into the investigation before we discovered it was, in 
fact, microchips." 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities allege in the indictment that Doan and Tran started the 
crime ring, using the fictitious business name C.D. Computer as a cover. 
</P>
<P>
The address given for C.D. Computer on Westminster Avenue in Santa Ana "was in 
fact a furniture store, which belonged to Dinh Huu Tran," Elledge said in an 
affidavit that accompanies the indictment. "C.D. Computer did not have an 
office location." 
</P>
<P>
The indictment claims that Doan and Tran hired Oklahoma City resident Son Manh 
Nguyen to persuade AT&amp;T employees to steal the chips. Nguyen is under 
investigation in connection with the scheme, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Doan then allegedly brought the stolen chips "from Oklahoma to California for 
distribution by the organization," according to the indictment. He allegedly 
earned $5 per chip for transporting them to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Tran and Doan allegedly sold the AT&amp;T chips to numerous electronics shops 
in Little Saigon that police have said fence hot chips and are a key cog in a 
vast international black market. 
</P>
<P>
Microchips, which are used in everything from toasters to missiles, make good 
booty because they are small but valuable. Just a handful can bring thousands 
of dollars, and they are difficult to trace because few have serial numbers. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T has not recovered a single chip stolen from its Oklahoma City plant. 
</P>
<P>
"This is better than moving dope," Elledge said. "If a cop stops you and you 
have a trunkload of chips, so what?" 
</P>
<P>
Tran opened six bank accounts in the Little Saigon area "for the purposes of 
receiving and distributing the proceeds of the stolen computer chips, and to 
obtain the needed currency to promote the carrying on of the unlawful 
activity," the indictment alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Bank records show that Tran was moving around hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"They had to generate large amounts of cash to purchase the chips," Elledge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The crime ring allegedly bought microchips from AT&amp;T employees for 
approximately $6 a piece and then sold them for as much as $35 a piece, Elledge 
said. The Treasury Department caught 12 employees in the scheme as part of an 
undercover operation that led to Doan and Tran.

Apple to Buy Back Shares: Apple Computer Inc. announced that it would buy back 
up to 5 million shares of its stock, which would represent 4% of the firm's 
125.2 million shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
The Cupertino, Calif., company said its board approved the plan because of its 
strong financial outlook. But industry analysts were unimpressed, saying that 
Apple, beset by a computer-buying slowdown and a dearth of new products, was 
clearly on the defensive. Since July, 1986, Apple has repurchased a total of 20 
million common shares.

TELLEP DEFENDS LOCKHEED'S COST-CUTTING MOVES; 
</P>
<P>
TAKEOVERS: THE CHAIRMAN OF THE AEROSPACE FIRM COUNTERS CHARGES FROM NL 
INDUSTRIES, WHICH CALLED LOCKHEED'S RESTRUCTURING A FAILURE.

Responding to attacks from a group seeking to replace his board of directors, 
Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep on Monday predicted that his 1989 plan for 
cutting non-productive assets and other costs will help the aerospace firm 
generate larger profits. 
</P>
<P>
Tellep also criticized his rivals' strategic proposals for Lockheed, calling 
them "vague and superficial." 
</P>
<P>
Tellep's comments, made in an interview, were designed to counter assertions 
made by NL Industries, a Houston company controlled by Harold C. Simmons. NL 
Industries, which supports Simmons and his rival slate of Lockheed board 
candidates, Sunday had charged that the aerospace firm's restructuring plans 
had been a failure. 
</P>
<P>
Tellep said Simmons does not understand Lockheed or the restructuring plan, 
which was announced in April, 1989. The plan calls for asset sales, cost 
cutting and for action designed to stimulate the growth of Lockheed's 
commercial operations -- projects outside the firm's core business of aerospace 
and defense contracting. 
</P>
<P>
NL Industries has said that Lockheed's diversification efforts divert the 
attention of Lockheed executives from their "core" businesses of contracting 
for the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration. The assertion was made in an NL proxy statement mailed to 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued Sunday, said Lockheed "should not be foreclosed from 
pursuing sensible diversification" but said Lockheed management should "now be 
focusing on the immediate task (of) strengthening the space, missiles and 
aeronautical operations." 
</P>
<P>
Said Tellep: "I believe the statement is vague, superficial and contradictory." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons and NL Industries President J. Landis Martin restated their criticisms 
during a presentation to Wall Street financial analysts in New York Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, who will seek shareholder support for his board slate at Lockheed's 
March 29 annual meeting, told analysts that Lockheed's operations were not 
being managed efficiently. He also said his group would hire Salomon Bros., the 
New York-based investment banking firm, to analyze Lockheed's financial 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We can do a better job of cost control," Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who also spoke at the presentation, criticized Lockheed for deciding to 
retain CalComp, a firm that makes computer graphics materials. Lockheed last 
April announced it would sell CalComp and other units in it informations 
systems wing, but later removed the firm from the sales block. Martin also said 
Lockheed had recently sold two other information systems units at a price he 
considered too low. 
</P>
<P>
However, Tellep said Lockheed made a profit on the two deals, selling them for 
a combined price of $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
Tellep discussed his restructuring plans with institutional investors in Boston 
on Monday. A statement from Tellep on restructuring is also being delivered to 
Lockheed shareholders this week. The letter said restructuring "will position 
Lockheed for growth in profitability and shareholder value."

ARCHIVE TO ACQUIRE RIVAL CIPHER IN $121-MILLION DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ending a seesaw takeover battle between bitter rivals in the computer 
tape-drive market, Archive Corp. agreed to acquire Cipher Data Products in an 
$8.25-per-share, $121-million cash tender offer, both firms announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The merger under the Archive banner will create a computer peripherals 
manufacturer with revenue of about $350 million, using annualized, current 
sales figures. The newly merged firm will control roughly 45% of the 
fast-growing quarter-inch cartridge tape-drive market, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Archive Chairman D. Howard Lewis said in an interview that there were "really 
good strategic reasons for combining Archive and Cipher. (Cipher) has good, 
strong technology," particularly in the 3.5-inch tape-drive market. Tape drives 
are used by computer owners to back up hard and floppy disk drives. 
</P>
<P>
But Costa Mesa-based Archive was also motivated to acquire San Diego-based 
Cipher as a way of disposing of the patent infringement suit filed by Cipher 
Data last year, analysts said. The suit alleges that Archive improperly used 
loading technology developed by Cipher for its cartridge tape drives. The legal 
action was strengthened by Cipher's victory in a similar suit against 
competitor Wangtek last spring. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, which was scheduled to go to trial in a Santa Ana federal court 
next October, now has been "rendered moot" by the merger agreement, Archive and 
Cipher officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Archive launched a hostile $7.50-per-share tender offer for Cipher on Dec. 19. 
Shortly after the offer was launched, Cipher's board rejected it as 
"inadequate, excessively conditional and not in the best interest of the 
company or its shareholders." The tender offer was particularly inadequate in 
light of Archive's potential liability in the patent suit, Cipher's board said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, owners of 85% of Cipher's outstanding shares had tendered their 
stock to Archive as of March 8. 
</P>
<P>
However, the success of Archive's hostile tender offer was still at issue 
because of Cipher Data's anti-takeover "poison pill" shareholder rights plan 
that was designed to dilute the holdings of any shareholder who acquired more 
than 15% of Cipher stock without its board's approval. 
</P>
<P>
In a Jan. 29 hearing in U.S. District Court in San Diego, Archive received bad 
news when it was denied a request for a preliminary injunction that would have 
effectively nullified the poison pill. However, Archive received good news 
that, despite industry analysts' concerns that the merger could violate 
Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust statutes, the tender offer went unopposed by 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"Once Hart-Scott-Rodino thresholds were passed, there were only a couple of 
things that could happen," said Scott Rowe, high-technology analyst with 
Robertson Stephens &amp; Co., an investment banking firm in San Francisco. 
"Either Cipher would come up with a white knight or Archive would come up with 
a higher price," Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
Cipher became vulnerable to a takeover after its stock price was dragged down 
by two quarters of steep losses and sharply declining sales. For the six months 
ended Dec. 31, Cipher reported a $26.1-million loss on $82.2 million in sales, 
contrasted with a $7-million profit on sales of $105.9 million for the same 
period the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating market for Cipher's half-inch reel-to-reel tape drives, a 
product line that is used by owners of minicomputers, was a big cause of the 
company's woes. The sluggish sales reported by major minicomputer 
manufacturers, including International Business Machines, Digital Equipment and 
Unisys, had a negative impact on demand for Cipher's products. 
</P>
<P>
For its first quarter ended Dec. 29, Archive reported a profit of $3.5 million 
on sales of $47 million, up from a profit of $3.2 million on sales of $35.9 
million for the same three months the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Cipher Data's sales would have declined further had it not acquired Irwin 
Magnetics last April, a manufacturer of quarter-inch tape drives that fit a 
3.5-inch form factor. The acquisition added nearly $29 million to Cipher's 
revenues for the past two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a dramatic drop in demand for its half-inch tape products, 
Cipher Data attempted a restructuring, reducing its work force by 24% since 
October to the current 1,682 employees and moving most of its remaining U.S. 
manufacturing capacity to plants in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the tender offer say Archive will honor the $2.8 million in 
aggregate "golden parachute" severance payments due to Cipher Data Chairman 
Gary Liebl and seven other executives. Liebl was unavailable for comment on the 
agreement Monday.

LABOR: EASTERN'S WORKERS IN BANKRUPTCY WEB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of Eastern Airlines' workers are entangled in a financial web being 
woven by Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., with 
the help of a compliant federal bankruptcy judge and his equally accommodating 
examiner. 
</P>
<P>
Tragically ignored, however, are nearly 20,000 Eastern workers who have been on 
strike for nearly a year out of fear that Lorenzo would strip Eastern of its 
assets to benefit his debt-plagued Texas Air. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Burton Lifland says he isn't unfairly siding with Lorenzo because, as a 
debtor's judge, his main job is to get the debtor, Eastern, out of bankruptcy 
and keep it flying. His examiner, David Shapiro, echoes that view. 
</P>
<P>
But in his actions and in the steps that he has allowed Lorenzo to take thus 
far in the bankruptcy, the judge appears to have in mind only the interests of 
Lorenzo and his companies. 
</P>
<P>
Lifland and Shapiro have been giving Lorenzo almost everything that he wanted 
to "restructure" (read: dismantle) Eastern, thereby eliminating thousands of 
jobs. Prime examples were the court's approval of the sales of Eastern's 
profitable Air Shuttle and some of its Latin American routes. 
</P>
<P>
So it came as a shock last week when Shapiro issued a report that seemed to say 
the unions that Lorenzo is so furiously trying to break were right all along. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro's report appeared to charge not only that Lorenzo siphoned off as much 
as $400 million from Eastern but that in doing so he also may have pushed the 
company into bankruptcy. Shapiro threatened to kick Lorenzo out of Eastern if 
Texas Air didn't repay Eastern for some of its assets that he had taken. 
</P>
<P>
Tough-sounding talk from a man who until then had acted like Lorenzo's ally. 
</P>
<P>
So Lorenzo yelled foul, saying Eastern had been adequately compensated for 
assets that he took from it, such as some of Eastern's airport gates and its 
valuable computerized reservation system, which he sold to Texas Air. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently startled by Lorenzo's criticism, Shapiro quickly backpedaled, 
explaining that he was only trying to say there might be legal grounds for 
Eastern's many creditors or the unions to claim in court that Lorenzo had 
looted Eastern, not that such claims would be upheld. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, angry as Lorenzo seemed to be about Shapiro's "unfair" report, he 
still urged the judge to quickly accept the agreement that he reached with 
Shapiro under which Texas Air would repay Eastern only $280 million of what may 
have been up to $400 million drained from the beleaguered Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
But look more closely. According to Shapiro's recommendation, only $132 million 
would be in cash. The rest is to be paid by giving Eastern some notes and some 
good deals, such as selling it some planes at low prices and giving it back a 
share in the computer reservation system. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to at least one observer, the payment to Eastern will end up 
being considerably less than the $280 million, according to Robert Clayman, a 
member of the creditors committee representing the unions. Clayman put the 
amount of the cash payment at $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo provided a glimpse of his real strategy in an intriguing, if confusing, 
press release issued after the Shapiro report. Although he was agreeing to make 
the payments to Eastern, he insisted on casting the transaction as an infusion 
of money to help Eastern survive rather than as reparation payments for Texas 
Air's rip-off of its subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Why should Lorenzo care whether the payment is seen as a penalty or a cash 
infusion? 
</P>
<P>
Texas Air owns Eastern and Lorenzo knows that under our complex bankruptcy laws 
he could retain full control of Eastern if Texas Air gives it some survival 
money, bankruptcy analysts said. Odd, but that seems to be the strange way that 
the bankruptcy law works. 
</P>
<P>
And why in all this tricky web weaving don't Lorenzo's creditors complain about 
the continuing asset sales and the size of Texas Air's cash payment to Eastern? 
After all, Lorenzo now says he may pay only 50 cents on the dollar, not the 
full amount that he promised several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, some creditors think that their best chance of getting at least 
something would be for Lorenzo to be allowed to fly a whittled-down Eastern or 
to dismantle it entirely and sell the pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Other creditors believe that they will do best if Lorenzo has the money-eating 
Eastern gobbled up by his other loser, Continental Airlines, which is now 
non-union because he destroyed the unions there through another Chapter 11 
bankruptcy ploy in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
And several of Eastern's principal creditors are manufacturers that are 
continuing to take multibillion dollar orders from Texas Air for new planes and 
engines. Why make more trouble for that financially teetering customer and 
increase the risk of losing those orders? 
</P>
<P>
Left out in the cold by the corporate web weaving are Eastern's workers, who 
have already given up hundreds of millions of dollars in wages and other 
concessions to help Eastern survive and who Lorenzo pushed out on strike a year 
ago when he demanded that they give up millions more. 
</P>
<P>
They and the creditors might be helped if the bankruptcy judge realizes that 
Lorenzo is primarily interested in destroying the unions and selling off 
Eastern bit by bit until nothing remains. 
</P>
<P>
The court should name independent administrators truly interested in Eastern's 
future to run the airline. With the court's help, these administrators might 
collect more money from Texas Air for its alleged looting of Eastern and 
revitalize it by a merger with another airline. 
</P>
<P>
Freed of Lorenzo's grip, a new Eastern might finally help the thousands of 
workers being so badly hurt by Lorenzo and his allies, those both inside and 
outside of the bankruptcy court.

AT&amp;T TO SHARE KEY ELEMENT IN SEMICONDUCTOR

<P>
AT&amp;T signed an agreement Monday to share a key ingredient used to make 
advanced semiconductors under the auspices of Sematech, the consortium of 
computer chip makers formed to boost U.S. semiconductor competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. will allow a 
division of Olin Corp. to make and sell a chemical used to etch extremely 
detailed electronic circuitry on chips. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical, called "deep UV resist," allows chip designers to pack a greater 
number of circuits on chips than with current technologies. In making chips, 
circuitry is etched on silicon wafers using a light-sensitive chemical -- or 
resist -- and a "mask," whose function is similar to that of a negative in 
photography. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories of Murray Hill, N.J., has invented a version of the 
chemical that is used with ultraviolet light instead of the visible light now 
used. 
</P>
<P>
UV resist can produce highly complex computer chips with circuits as thin as 
0.3 micrometers, or about 400 times smaller than a human hair, AT&amp;T said. 
</P>
<P>
Circuitry on most chips today is 1.0 to 1.2 microns wide; they reach 0.8 
microns in advanced chips.

MARKETING: ALTERNATIVE MAGAZINE TO TRY VOX POPULI APPROACH TO SETTING AD POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps you subscribe to Time or Newsweek. Or maybe magazines such as Turkey 
World or Furniture Forum find their way into your mailbox. Suppose -- whatever 
magazine you might receive -- the publication asked you what types of 
advertising you found acceptable? 
</P>
<P>
And what if the magazine also asked you which advertisers you liked -- and 
didn't like? 
</P>
<P>
Well, you've probably never received such an inquiry. After all, the way most 
magazines best serve readers is to correctly gauge which articles readers want 
to see -- and certainly not which advertisements. Right? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. At least, that's what Eric Utne thinks. And Utne soon plans to pose 
these questions directly to some of his readers. 
</P>
<P>
Utne is editor and publisher of a magazine called Utne Reader. The 
Minneapolis-based bimonthly may best be described as sort of a Readers Digest 
of the alternative press. It reprints articles from such magazines as New Age 
Journal and Greenpeace. A recent issue included a cover story on "The Sexual 
Politics of Housework." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-year-old publication has attracted a loyal readership among baby boomers, 
and its circulation recently topped the 200,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
But success has not always been easy for Utne Reader. Five years ago, most of 
the ads in the magazine were for things like New Wave music and natural 
vitamins. But its most recent issue included ads for Olympus cameras and 
Time-Life Books. 
</P>
<P>
The question is: Are loyal readers of Utne Reader ready for the likes of 
American Express, AT&amp;T and Toyota? These are advertisers Eric Utne says his 
magazine would like to pursue from its newly opened New York sales office. 
Before it does, however, Utne plans to randomly poll at least 1,000 readers for 
their opinions on advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"I know this is unprecedented," said Utne. "It's also dangerous," he added. 
"You don't want to make advertisers worry that you might reject them. But our 
most important relationship isn't with advertisers, it's with our readers." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Utne is not the first to grapple with the problem of how to keep 
readers and advertisers happy. Earlier this month, Ms. magazine dealt directly 
with the issue by eliminating advertising altogether. And magazines like New 
Yorker and Good Housekeeping have long been known for their strict advertising 
guidelines. But advertising executives generally say they're not familiar with 
any magazine directly polling readers about ad policy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a good idea for magazines to find out as much as possible about 
their readers," said Donald Kummerfeld, president of Magazine Publishers of 
America. "The problem is, what if there's a split vote among readers. Then what 
do they do?" 
</P>
<P>
A magazine with one of the strictest advertising policies is Modern Maturity. 
The magazine, one of the most widely circulated in the world, refuses all ads 
that depict aging in a negative light. "We know that advertising is just as 
important as editorial in shaping the overall feel and cadence of the 
magazine," said Robert E. Wood, publishing director. "It's always a good idea 
to let readers know you care about their opinions." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone thinks asking readers about ads is appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"A successful magazine should know what its readers want without asking them," 
said Samir Husni, publisher of the Guide to New Magazines published by the 
University of Mississippi. "I doubt if their readers really care if they carry 
mainstream or alternative ads." 
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard of that in my life," said Dana Fields, associate publisher of 
Rolling Stone. "I give readers credit for knowing that ads and editorial are 
two different things." 
</P>
<P>
Utne disagrees. "Some people might say we're anti-business, but that's not the 
case at all. I have no problems carrying ads. We just want them to be a good 
fit with our editorial." 
</P>
<P>
Take Exxon, for example. "If Exxon wanted to run an advertisement that said 
they were sorry, and that pointed out all the new steps they were taking to 
improve the environment, I think we'd consider it. But if they wanted to simply 
run an ad that said they're Mother Nature's best friend, well, there's no way 
would we take that." 
</P>
<P>
The poll, which Utne Reader hopes to do with the assistance of a major 
pollster, is scheduled to be taken next month. The magazine hasn't yet decided 
what it will do with the results. But there may be one thing Utne Reader 
probably shouldn't do with them. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be dangerous to publish the results," said Kummerfeld. "The last 
thing any magazine wants to do is split its readership." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
L.A. Ad Agency to Leave Sidewalks of New York 
</P>
<P>
If you think it's tough for a new agency to make it in the Los Angeles market, 
try Manhattan on for size. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles agency Keye/Donna/Pearlstein, which opened a New York office 
less than two years ago, has decided to close its doors there. It is 
negotiating to sell that office to the ad firm Della Femina, McNamee WCRS -- as 
well as talking with other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
But all is not lost. The agency's biggest New York client, the $10-million 
Bridgestone Corp. tire account, will now be handled out of the Los Angeles 
office along with the state Department of Health Services' $28.6-million 
anti-smoking account. Said Leonard Pearlstein, president of the agency: "It's 
just a decision to refocus on our Los Angeles office." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ketchum Plans to Tackle HMO Image Problems 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest problems faced by health maintenance organizations, or 
HMOs, are the unclear -- and often negative -- images many people have of them. 
</P>
<P>
So after winning the estimated $3-million to $5-million advertising account 
last week for Woodland Hills-based Health Net, the Ketchum/Los Angeles agency 
said it hopes that it can help improve the image of HMOs through advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people don't understand what HMOs are," said Richard Groff, vice 
president of strategic planning at Ketchum. "We hope to not only clarify what 
the HMO industry does, but Health Net's position in it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Promising Descendants of Hal Riney &amp; Partners 
</P>
<P>
Just as Chiat/Day/Mojo is often credited with breeding some of the Los Angeles 
area's up-and-coming small ad agencies, Hal Riney &amp; Partners is quickly 
developing the same reputation in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a group of four executives split from Riney to form the San 
Francisco agency Atlas Citron Haligman &amp; Bedecarre. In recent years, 
several other San Francisco hot shops formed after splitting off from Riney, 
including Mandelbaum Mooney Ashley two years ago, and prior to that, Goodby, 
Berlin &amp; Silverstein. 
</P>
<P>
"Where do you go after working for the smartest person in the advertising 
business?" posed Jeff Atlas, 33-year-old chairman of the new agency. "How do 
you find a higher standard than the best? Well, we felt the biggest challenge 
would be to open our own place." 
</P>
<P>
Three of the four partners formerly worked together at the New York office of 
Ogilvy &amp; Mather. Although the agency currently has no clients -- and said 
it will take none away from Riney -- it is expected to eventually try to lure 
away some Ogilvy clients. 
</P>
<P>
Why open an agency when the advertising industry is in a slowdown? "Most of the 
ads you see on the air are bad, so there's always room for improvement," said 
Atlas, who wrote the American Express "Do You Know Me" commercials featuring 
Tom Landry and Stephen King. "Besides, you get to a point where you want to 
control your own destiny." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Postal Price Hikes Are Music to Ears of Private Industry 
</P>
<P>
Every time the U.S. Postal Service raises its rates, it comes one step closer 
to losing two of its best customers: direct mail advertisers and magazine 
publishers. 
</P>
<P>
The latest boost would add about three cents to the cost of mailing a weekly 
magazine such as Time, and more than seven cents to mailing larger monthly 
publications such as Vogue. 
</P>
<P>
"By the mid-1990s, a substantial portion of magazines in large urban areas will 
be sent by alternative delivery," said Donald Kummerfeld, president of Magazine 
Publishers of America. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Direct Marketing Assn. said its 3,500 members are also seeking 
alternative forms of delivery. In growing numbers, private companies are being 
hired to deliver magazines or product information door to door. Said 
Kummerfeld: "The Postal Service is pricing itself out of our reach."

PUBLIC STORAGE SET TO SEND ITS TROUBLES PACKING; 
</P>
<P>
SERVICES: RETURNS HAVE BEEN CUT, BUT THE INDUSTRY'S PIONEER SAYS IT IS POISED 
FOR A NEW GROWTH SPURT.

Wayne Hughes is not a household name, but his trademark is commonplace: Those 
bright orange signs denoting Public Storage self-storage warehouses, where 
people rent garage-size rooms for $60 or $80 a month to store furniture, 
clothes and who knows what. 
</P>
<P>
Since co-founding the Glendale-based company in 1972, B. Wayne Hughes Sr. has 
built Public Storage Inc. into the nation's biggest chain of self-storage 
facilities, with 1,000 locations in 38 states and Canada and 456,000 tenants 
who spend $350 million a year in rental fees. Public Storage, which also 
manages 51 business parks, has developed 63 million square feet of storage and 
office space, making it one of the biggest U.S. developers. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes also is a major real estate syndicator, having persuaded investors to 
pony up most of the $3 billion that has been spent to build or buy Public 
Storage's sites. The company earns fees on each new deal and gets a cut of up 
to 26% of the sites' rental fees. As the 75% owner of the company, Hughes, 56, 
is worth at least $50 million on paper. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that success, Hughes and Kenneth Q. Volk Jr., co-founder, chairman 
and 25% owner of the company, spawned a self-storage industry in which 
thousands of small-time operators opened "mini-warehouses" in the 1980s. The 
industry now has 20,000 buildings nationwide and more than $3 billion in annual 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
But Hughes is finding the business less friendly lately. Public Storage has 
struggled to attract investors to recent projects, owing to the sagging real 
estate investment market, lower yields on Public Storage's deals and investor 
nervousness about Public Storage's issuance three years ago of $135 million of 
junk bonds. The surge in competition has also made it harder for Public Storage 
to find new sites and to raise rental prices. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying all the yields are equal and everything is working perfect, 
because it's not," Hughes said. Indeed, yields on Public Storage's partnerships 
and other investment products have always varied. Generally the yields were 20% 
a year or higher on funds going back several years, and they have dropped on 
more recent deals. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Stanger &amp; Co., a partnership research firm in Shrewsbury, N.J., said 
it found that among the 14 Public Storage public partnerships where appraised 
values for the underlying properties were available, the average annual yield 
was 12.7% at year-end 1988. Stanger noted that while the highest yield in the 
group was 33%, the lowest performer had a meager yield of 1.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes explained the lower yields on recent deals by saying the properties 
backing those investments are newer and have not had time to generate the cash 
flow to provide higher returns. "They don't all start off as a roaring 
success," he said, adding that it usually takes a year to build a small 
warehouse, then three years for it to reach full occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
However, Stanger noted that the lowest-yielding partnership it found, the one 
with the 1.9% yield, dated back to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes also discounted Public Storage's junk bond exposure. A Public Storage 
subsidiary issued the bonds and has had sufficient cash flow to meet the 
payments, he said, adding that Public Storage has also bought back $43 million 
of the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said Public Storage is poised to expand sharply and "to really dominate 
the market." 
</P>
<P>
How? Thanks to the savings and loan debacle. At least 70 self-storage 
facilities are among the properties that the federal government seized from 
insolvent S&amp;Ls and is preparing to sell through its Resolution Trust Corp. 
Public Storage plans to raise $100 million, which should buy about half of the 
properties, Hughes said. (A newly built small warehouse can cost up to $5 
million, including land. At that price, 35 new properties would cost $175 
million.) 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Public Storage plans to expand by about 40% over the next two years, 
with most of the additional 400 properties being bought from competitors, 
Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks it's a buyer's market because most existing self-storage warehouses 
were built by small operators who borrowed the needed cash from S&amp;Ls. 
Because of the S&amp;L mess, thrifts seldom make such loans today, industry 
officials said. That will limit the number of new competitors Public Storage 
must face. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;Ls' problems "took the fuel away from the independent operators," 
agreed Tim Riley, marketing director for Shurgard Storage Centers, a 
Seattle-based concern that, with 200 outlets, is the nation's third-largest 
self-storage operator behind Public Storage and U-Haul International, which has 
about 600 sites. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the competition has ebbed, Hughes hopes to raise prices at Public 
Storage's existing sites. "Since they're not building any more, I'm going back 
to those rate increases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Until the mid-1980s, Public Storage raised rates an average 8% a year, but last 
year it managed just a 1.6% average increase because of the added competition. 
</P>
<P>
Public Storage sidestepped the S&amp;L fiasco because it obtains nearly all of 
its cash from the capital markets. The company has sponsored 160 various funds, 
including public and private partnerships, and real estate investment trusts 
(REITs) such as Storage Equities Inc., whose shares trade on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the private partnerships are solely for institutional investors, such 
as pension funds; some are earmarked only for foreign investors (Queen 
Elizabeth has money in one, Hughes said), and others are aimed at individual 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
"They are better at raising money than anybody in the industry," said Hardy 
Good, who publishes Mini Storage Messenger, a trade magazine in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Or at least they used to be. Eight months ago, Public Storage began seeking 
investors to raise at least $75 million to start another REIT, but "it looks 
like we're probably going to get $35 million," Hughes admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate investments, notably partnerships, have fallen into disfavor with 
individual investors in recent years because of tax law changes and financial 
problems at other big partnership syndicators. But institutional investors -- 
pension funds, insurance companies and the like -- have also been less enamored 
with Public Storage lately. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Hughes acknowledged that Public Storage's most recent 
institutional fund garnered just $80 million of the $100 million the company 
hoped to raise. 
</P>
<P>
But the Los Angeles Fire and Police Pension System, with $3.6 billion in 
assets, was among those investing in the project, placing $10 million in the 
fund. "We are familiar with the product, and it's worked in the past," said 
Gary Mattingly, general manager of the city's Department of Pensions. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, an Oklahoma native who earned a bachelor's degree in business from USC, 
did not invent the self-storage business. There were scattered storage 
facilities in the 1960s, mainly in Texas, and it was not until 1972 that Hughes 
and Volk first saw one next to a freeway in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
But they quickly determined that a self-storage warehouse, if only partly 
occupied, could pay for itself and the surrounding acreage. "I saw a method of 
holding prime land with income," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Public Storage needs only to have 25% occupancy for a warehouse to break 
even, yet the company's actual average occupancy rate is 83%. Overhead costs 
are low. The warehouses -- unlike apartments or offices -- have no carpets, 
drapes, furniture or ventilating equipment that need cleaning or replacing. 
</P>
<P>
The warehouses are built next to freeways and in other high-visibility areas so 
that people remember their location when they need storage. Storage operators 
depend on major jolts in peoples' lives -- such as an unexpected move, a 
divorce or birth -- to generate business, and the average tenant stays about 
nine months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said Public Storage's staying power is improving because the 
self-storage business has added less new space each year since 1985, its peak 
building year.

SECURITY PACIFIC DEAL FOUGHT BY CONSUMER GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of California community groups has asked the Federal Reserve to 
reject Security Pacific National Bank's attempt to acquire 20% of Mitsui 
Manufacturers Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The move is the latest effort by consumer activists to thwart bank mergers that 
they contend fail to provide adequate benefits for minority and low-income 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
In a five-page letter sent Monday to a Federal Reserve vice president, the 
so-called California Reinvestment Committee contended that Security Pacific's 
credit record fails to meet standards under the 1977 federal Community 
Reinvestment Act, which requires regulators to examine whether merging 
financial institutions provide loans and credit to neighborhood residents. 
</P>
<P>
"In all of 1988, Security Pacific made only three loans to home buyers in 
predominantly black South Central Los Angeles," Gail Hillebrand, an attorney 
for Consumers Union, one of six community groups opposing the acquisition, said 
in a release. 
</P>
<P>
But Dick Warner, a spokesman for Security Pacific, said the bank's Community 
Reinvestment Act record was reviewed last fall by regulatory agencies in 
connection with its merger with Southwest Bank and "was said to be 
satisfactory." 
</P>
<P>
Warner said the total of only three home loans to South Central residents in 
1988 was accurate but "do not reflect the current state of affairs." He had no 
current numbers, however. 
</P>
<P>
Hillebrand said Security Pacific should follow the lead of Bank of America and 
Wells Fargo, which have set $50 million and $25 million, respectively, as goals 
for affordable-home lending for minorities and the poor.

<P>
 -- To An Athlete Dying Young, A.E. Housman 
</P>
<P>
Midcourt in a basketball game is a terrible place to die. So is the 
five-yard-line of the Chicago Bears. So is the center ring at Madison Square 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Age 23 is a terrible time to die. But, then, so is 63. Maybe no one is ever 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
"Ventricular fibrillation" is something palsied old men get, not power 
forwards. Doctors might be tempted to disbelieve their instruments. 
</P>
<P>
How could Hank Gathers, 6 feet 7, 210 pounds, a franchise basketball player, 
fast, strong, a stupendous physical specimen, be a walking invalid? How could 
Lou Gehrig, the most powerful baseball player I have ever seen, be a victim of 
a disease so terrible it would reduce him to a man without the strength to lift 
a cup of coffee? What kind of cosmic joke is at work here? 
</P>
<P>
Death should stay away from young men's games. Death belongs in musty hospital 
rooms, sickbeds. It should not impinge its terrible presence on the 
celebrations of youth, reap its frightful harvest in fields where cheers ring 
and bands play and banners wave. 
</P>
<P>
But it does. Sudden-Athletic-Death syndrome is all too common. Medical 
symposiums have been held on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is shocking when it comes. It is resented. Death should know its place. 
How dare it claim our youngest, our fittest, our future? The inexorable 
workings of God? Or the inevitable blundering of man? 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Hank Gathers should not have been playing basketball. The awful 
result makes that abundantly clear. He fainted at a free-throw line as recently 
as December. Dying men should not be at a free-throw line. A slam dunk is not 
recommended therapeutic care for an arrhythmic heart. The doctors are very 
clear on that. 
</P>
<P>
As long ago as 1985, cardiologists met and addressed the problem with a finding 
of their society that no one with cardiomyopathic problems should be playing 
pressure competitive sports. 
</P>
<P>
But how do you tell a kid whose whole life, whose every dream, has been built 
around a sport? How do you say, "Tough luck, Hank, but you're going back to the 
projects. It's all over. You've got all the tools, size, speed, reflexes, but 
there's this one tiny muscle that's out of sync -- your heart." How do you tell 
a guy who led the nation in scoring and rebounding and led his little school 
into the gaudy NCAA tournament that he doesn't belong out there? 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Mantle probably should not have been playing big league baseball. He had 
osteomyelitis. Players like Norm Larker and Rick Reichardt had only one kidney. 
Earnie Shavers fought with a detached retina. Sam Langford fought with two of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Christopher pitched for seven years in the majors with what was described 
as "a hole in his heart." He pitched till 1949 and had 17 saves in his last 
full year. He died in 1954. He was 37 years old. 
</P>
<P>
There is a young man playing basketball in South Carolina now, Joe Rhett, who 
began having fainting spells. His heart stopped altogether for five beats under 
testing. He has been fitted with a pacemaker to keep the heart jarred into 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
Should he play? Doubtful. Will he play? Doubtless. 
</P>
<P>
One of the greatest athletes the San Joaquin Valley, which was a hotbed of 
them, ever produced was a young man you never heard of. Leon Patterson put the 
shot more than 60 feet the first time he ever picked it up. He was the first 
high school athlete to throw that far. He threw the discus 167-10 the first 
time he tried it. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran the 100 in 10.1, pole-vaulted 12 feet in high school on a steel pole -- 
when the Olympic record was 14 feet -- threw the javelin almost 200 feet. He 
was a good-enough football player to have Notre Dame after him and he 
high-jumped 5-11 in high school, wearing a baseball uniform. The Olympic record 
was 6-8 that year. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Patterson had his heart set on the 1956 Olympics at Melbourne. He was a 
threat in the shot and discus and a natural for the decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
He went out to get a summer job in the oil fields near Coalinga and, when he 
took the physical, they found albumin in his urine. It could have been any one 
of a number of things. In Leon's case it was the worst -- Bright's disease, a 
catastrophic disorder of the kidneys, incurable and, in that year, largely 
untreatable. 
</P>
<P>
He could live 10 years, the doctors said, if he gave up sports and strenuous 
activity. Leon compromised. He gave up football. He clung to track and field. 
</P>
<P>
He got married. Ten years can be long enough if you play it right, he and his 
bride told themselves. Besides, doctors can be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors were wrong. Leon Patterson didn't have 10 years, he had two. He 
died screaming after a summer spent loading 40-pound crates of grapes onto 
boxcars in the broiling valley sun, sometimes working 17 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
Did Hank Gathers know the direness of his plight? If so, would a life as a 
might-have-been be acceptable to him? Should he have had a say in the matter? 
Could he have believed the doctors? 
</P>
<P>
Marc Buoniconti, the son of the pro football's Nick Buoniconti, suffered a 
severed spinal cord while making a tackle in a college game. He was quoted in 
the papers the other day as saying, "I've always said that a young player will 
always want to play, whatever the risk. It's up to the doctors and trainers to 
stand between him and the field." 
</P>
<P>
But the poet has said, "I must have my dreams if I must live." The athletes are 
wrong to risk all for a career in the light, a life in the center ring. We, in 
crabbed age, know that. But did we know it at 23? Remember, young men march 
off, singing, to war. 
</P>
<P>
 "And round that early-laureled head 
</P>
<P>
 "Will flock to gaze the strengthless dead 
</P>
<P>
 "And find unwithered on its curls 
</P>
<P>
 "A garland briefer than a girl's."

PRO FOOTBALL: RAIDER OWNER SAYS L.A. COULD HAVE KEPT THE TEAM IF OFFICIALS HAD 
HEEDED A WARNING BY THE NFL COMMISSIONER THAT THE COLISEUM NEEDED UPDATING.

<P>
Al Davis strongly suggested Monday that Los Angeles politicians were to blame 
for his deciding to move the Raiders back to Oakland in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"(NFL Commissioner Paul) Tagliabue tried to send a message at the Super Bowl 
(two months ago) that the Coliseum has been found wanting," Davis, a Raider 
owner since 1963, said a few minutes after telephoning the Oakland negotiators 
from his hotel. 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a January news conference at which Tagliabue, on behalf of 
the NFL, described the Coliseum as unacceptable for pro football. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' implication was that if, after getting that message, Los Angeles' 
negotiators had gotten on with the job of repairing their 70-year-old stadium, 
they could have kept the Raider franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. (politicians) should have done much more much earlier," Davis said. "They 
reneged on the (promises) they made to me verbally and also in writing." 
</P>
<P>
Raider spokesmen allege, first, that plans for Coliseum improvements were 
authorized in the early 1980s by the Coliseum Commission members who brought 
the club to Los Angeles; and, second, that these plans were scrapped when the 
membership of the board changed. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to elaborate on what happened to keep the commission from rebuilding the 
Coliseum, Davis remarked: "I'm not going to get into that." 
</P>
<P>
The question of whether there were oral promises was recently addressed in a 
Coliseum-Raider lawsuit, and a court held there were no such promises. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Davis left Oakland waiting for his announcement, he said, because, 
"I wasn't ready to make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
Later, he said he postponed the decision to give Los Angeles another chance, 
hoping that the Coliseum Commission would meet with Spectacor, the Coliseum's 
operating company, over the weekend and come up with an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Davis has not yet cut all his ties to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"Our (Coliseum) lease has another two years to go," he said. "We expect to play 
in Los Angeles in 1990 and 1991. We'll also stay at Oxnard and El Segundo (for 
the time being)." 
</P>
<P>
The club's summer training camp is at Oxnard, its offices at El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thinks he can sell any Raider tickets this fall, he said: "We're 
selling them." 
</P>
<P>
Leaving every door open, he added: "I respect Los Angeles. I respect Sacramento 
(which he turned down earlier this month as a relocation site)." 
</P>
<P>
Davis insisted that the Oakland move is only conditional. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a fait accompli," he said. "There is attorney language (to 
consider), there are bonds to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the (Oakland politicians) that the Raiders will be happy to return 
under the following conditions: If they get the vote of (the city and county), 
and if all the documents are acceptable to the Raiders." 
</P>
<P>
By documents, he meant the official papers validating the $600 million that 
Oakland has promised Davis in the way of stadium improvements, a franchise fee 
and other considerations. 
</P>
<P>
The $600 million contrasts starkly with the $13 million in stadium improvements 
he sought from Oakland in 1980 before moving to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It is because Oakland let him get away the first time that the Raider owner is 
wary of making any plans except conditionally. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had a deal with Irwindale," he said, alluding to the Los Angeles 
suburb that once sealed their agreement with an unconditional $10 million 
present to the club. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were going to stay in Oakland (in 1980). I thought we were going 
to get the Coliseum (improved) in Los Angeles. There are a lot of perils in 
(moving). Something could still go wrong." 
</P>
<P>
For that and other reasons, Davis answered few questions precisely and avoided 
all hypothetical questions with the same phrase: "Let the process go on." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, before he will declare flatly that he is Oakland-bound, he wants "to be 
sure that Oakland gets the job done." 
</P>
<P>
Sidestepping reports that the San Francisco 49ers want an indemnity if the 
Raiders move into their territory, Davis said: "They were selling 35,000 
tickets (in a 60,000-seat stadium) when we left -- and they offered to pay our 
bus ride to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
He admitted that Oakland fans will be getting an also-ran team this time to 
replace the winner they had when the Raiders were there before. 
</P>
<P>
"We've slipped in the last few years," he said. "We've (usually) been in it 
until the last game of the season -- if that's slipping." 
</P>
<P>
Of the Raider years in Los Angeles, he only has one regret. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret the effect that (the move) had on my team and my life, and the lives 
of so many other (Raiders)," he said. "It was all so unnecessary."

OLYMPIC CHAMPION EVANS GETS SULLIVAN AWARD

Six years ago, Janet Evans was churning through a preliminary heat during the 
Mission Viejo Swim Meet of Champions when Mark Schubert, then coach of the 
Mission Viejo Nadadores, turned to a reporter and said, "She's the tiniest 
thing I've ever seen and she's got a funny-looking stroke, but keep your eye on 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Evans, then an 80-pound 12-year-old, looked like a wind-up bathtub toy with her 
almost-straight arms paddle-wheeling through the water. But Schubert, now the 
women's coach at the University of Texas, knew a prospect when he saw one. And, 
indeed, the whole world has had its eye on Janet Evans ever since that windmill 
stroke propelled her to three gold medals in the 1988 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night at the Westin Hotel in Indianapolis before a black-tie crowd of 
1,300, the Placentia teen-ager added yet another accolade to an already 
bursting trophy case when she was awarded the James E. Sullivan Memorial Trophy 
as the outstanding amateur athlete of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
It was third time she had been nominated for the award. Last year, Evans lost 
out to Florence Griffith-Joyner despite setting a world record and an American 
record during her triple-gold performance in Seoul, Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Evans came back strong in 1989, however, breaking her own world record in the 
800-meter freestyle, establishing American marks in the 1,000- and 1,650-yard 
freestyle events and running her unbeaten streak to 27 consecutive races. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to miss coming back here every year," she said, flashing the 
infectious grin that earned the reputation as "America's Sweetheart" during the 
1988 Summer Games. "Just being a finalist is quite an honor and this is an even 
greater honor. I'm pleasantly surprised." 
</P>
<P>
Evans, apparently just as at ease in a pink, off-the-shoulder taffeta gown as 
she is in a lycra swimsuit, said the award helped reaffirm that she had made 
the right choice by deciding to continue her swimming career at Stanford rather 
than accept a number of lucrative endorsement deals. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone told me after the Olympics how hard it was to come back the next year 
and do well," Evans said. "It was a difficult decision, whether to swim 
collegiately or take the money. Now I'm really glad I decided to keep 
swimming." 
</P>
<P>
So is Richard Quick, coach of Stanford's defending NCAA champion women's team. 
But he isn't exactly overjoyed that Evans, his star freshman, decided to come 
here for the award presentation just three days before the NCAA championships 
begin in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"Richard wrote up some workouts and I swam three times in the (Indiana 
University) Natatorium," said Evans, who is no longer dwarfed by the 
competition at 5-7, 116 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this little break will help me. I'm swimming faster than ever in 
training, so we'll see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Evans, 18, is the 10th female and the second-youngest athlete to win the 
Sullivan Award. Swimmer Tracy Caulkins won in 1978 when she was 16.

The agony, the ecstasy -- the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
It gets so mixed up in this zaniest of organizations. That's how it has been 
for eight seasons in Los Angeles, all soaring highs and plummeting lows. 
</P>
<P>
Two years after their arrival, the Raiders gave Los Angeles its only Super Bowl 
victory. In the last four seasons before announcing their intention to return 
to Oakland, they have failed to post a winning record or make the playoffs, the 
longest such slump in their history. 
</P>
<P>
They list seven 90,000 crowds in the Los Angeles Coliseum. They played to as 
few as 32,111 -- five weeks before they won Super Bowl XVIII -- and 10,708, for 
the first "replacement" game during the 1987 strike. 
</P>
<P>
They got into fights, suits and snits -- with opponents, the league, the 
newspapers, and, of course, one another. 
</P>
<P>
A highlight was promotions director Mike Ornstein's punching of executive 
assistant John Herrera at camp in Oxnard in 1986. In another organization, it 
would have been hushed up, or heads would have rolled. These are the Raiders 
and no action was taken, internally. Herrera signed a criminal complaint. 
Ornstein pleaded no contest. 
</P>
<P>
Ornstein was fired two years later -- for sounding out the Rams about 
employment. Some things Al Davis simply couldn't forgive. 
</P>
<P>
This is how it was, year by unforgettable year. 
</P>
<P>
1982 
</P>
<P>
Disaster hits right away when the ticket-location procedure becomes hopelessly 
messed up, the skeleton Raider front office overmatched by the task at hand. A 
former Raider official says it was widely acknowledged that if they hadn't 
opened seven weeks late, thanks to that year's strike, they would never have 
been ready. 
</P>
<P>
The team lives in, practices in and commutes from Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiderettes fly down from Oakland, too. They're all Oakland girls, none 
from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders play their first home game in the L.A. Coliseum Nov. 22. A crowd of 
55,060 sees them fall behind the Chargers, 24-0, then rally to win, 28-24. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders go 8-1, the NFL's best record. Rookie Marcus Allen rushes for 697 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 18, they beat the Rams in their return to the Coliseum, 37-31. A crowd 
of 65,776 makes this the NFL's first million-dollar regular-season gate. 
</P>
<P>
Regular-season attendance averages only 56,798. However, 90,037 -- with only 
651 no-shows -- watch the Raiders' AFC semifinal against the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders seem headed for a Super Bowl matchup with the Redskins in Pasadena 
but are upset by the Jets, 17-14. Jim Plunkett throws an interception to 
linebacker Lance Mehl, ending the last threat. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Jet Coach Lou Michaels charges that Al Davis, up to his old tricks, 
called Michaels on a pay phone outside the Jets' dressing room at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Davis denies it. 
</P>
<P>
After most writers have left, a man calls the same pay phone and says it was 
he. He's in a bar in Queens. 
</P>
<P>
1983 
</P>
<P>
The Raider players move to Los Angeles but tell anyone who asks that they miss 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The team goes 12-4. 
</P>
<P>
Average attendance stays in the mid-50s during the season, but for the 
playoffs, the Raiders get 92,434 and 92,335. 
</P>
<P>
In a Super Bowl highlighted by Jack Squirek's interception, Derrick Jensen's 
punt block, Ray Guy's leap to catch a high snap, Marcus Allen's 191 yards 
rushing, and too many more feats to mention, they squash the Redskins, 38-9, 
the largest margin of victory in a Super Bowl until then. 
</P>
<P>
Allen is the game's MVP after a frustrating season, during which he confronted 
Davis and asked to carry the ball more. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rozelle is forced to present the Lombardi Trophy to his arch-foe for the 
second time in four years. The world waits to hear what Davis will say after 
moving, suing, winning the suit and now the championship of football, too. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, smiling hugely, says, "Just win, baby." 
</P>
<P>
The phrase becomes more popular than "One small step for a man, one large step 
for mankind." 
</P>
<P>
Davis also says: "Ah believe the greatness of this team lahs in its fu-chuh." 
</P>
<P>
Lots of people agree. The Raiders have a fine old quarterback, Plunkett; a 
highly regarded young one, Marc Wilson; enough depth for two offensive lines; 
the greatest cornerback tandem ever in Mike Haynes and Lester Hayes; young 
Howie Long, old Lyle Alzado, zany Ted Hendricks, Rod Martin, Matt Millen, Cliff 
Branch. 
</P>
<P>
What could go wrong? 
</P>
<P>
1984 
</P>
<P>
Attendance skyrockets. Four of the eight home games draw better than 80,000. 
The season average is 70,023, the team record. 
</P>
<P>
They start 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
They face 7-1 Denver in the Coliseum, with John Elway out and Gary Kubiak 
subbing before 92,496, the largest crowd in Raider history. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos stun them, 22-19, in overtime. The Raiders blow a chance to kick 
the winning field goal when fullback Frank Hawkins fumbles inside the Denver 
10. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, the Raiders take a fearsome pounding in a 17-6 loss at Chicago. 
The young Bear defense KOs Wilson, who leaves with a right thumb injury, then 
breaks David Humm's jaw. Wilson returns while Guy warms up on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's thumb bothers him for weeks but he pulls out of it with a brilliant 
game in Miami. The Dolphins come in 12-1 and the Raiders upset them in a wild 
45-34 shoot-out. Dan Marino passed for 470 yards. Haynes returns an 
interception 97 yards for a touchdown. Everyone thinks the Raiders are back. 
</P>
<P>
But the season ends in a desultory 13-7 loss to the lowly Pittsburgh Steelers 
in the Coliseum. The field is a swamp, USC and Notre Dame having ground what 
remained of the turf under in a storm the day before. The Raiders try drying it 
with a helicopter. Wilson looks so bad, Tom Flores pulls him for Plunkett, who 
has been out with a groin injury for much of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders finish 11-5. With the last game, they've lost their chance to play 
at home in the wild-card game and must go to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Is Flores worried? 
</P>
<P>
He starts Plunkett. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders get beaten, 13-7. The Seahawks rush for 205 yards, led by a plodder 
named Dan Dornik who gets 126. 
</P>
<P>
Raider defenders point fingers all over the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no offense, so we got beat," says Alzado. "It's as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
1985 
</P>
<P>
Attendance climbs higher still, to an average of 70,360, another record. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders start 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
Game 4, against the 49ers, is a home game televised in Los Angeles, with 92,487 
tickets distributed before the 72-hour deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers murder them, 34-10. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Jeff Stover drives Plunkett to the ground, dislocating his right 
shoulder and ending his season. Plunkett is put on the golf cart for the ride 
to the dressing room. Equipment man Run Run Jones puts it in reverse by 
mistake, giving Plunkett another jolt. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson plays shakily -- his first pass the next week at New England is 
intercepted. The team rallies behind its stellar defense and Allen, en route to 
a league-high 1,759 yards rushing, plus 67 pass receptions for another 555 
yards. Raider insiders still say it's the greatest season a back ever had, 
since his line was mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
They finish 11-1. They'll be at home through the playoffs and figure they're 
headed for a Super Bowl matchup against the Bears in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
In their playoff opener against the Patriots, the Raiders lead, 17-7 -- and 
fall, 27-20. Wilson throws three interceptions and misses half a dozen open 
receivers. The Patriots score the winning touchdown when Sammy Seale fumbles 
into the end zone on a kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
Millen swats Patriot General Manager Pat Sullivan on the head with his helmet 
in a row on the way to the dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows it, but the Raiders have just bade adieu to the playoffs for the 
'80s. 
</P>
<P>
1986 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive year, the draft washes out. The year before, it 
started Jessie Hester-Tim Moffett-Stefon Adams. This time, it's Bob 
Buczkowski-Brad Cochran. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance remains high: 70,010. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Wilson remains the starting quarterback, Flores having urged Davis to 
quash a trade to the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson plays brilliantly in a season-opening 40-38 loss at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, he gets beaten up in a 10-6 loss at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders make it 0-3 the next week, losing at home to the Giants. Allen 
suffers a sprained ankle and his record string of 100-yard rushing games is 
broken at 11. 
</P>
<P>
Allen will rarely be sound again. He has had one 100-yard game since. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, though, rally to 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson struggles until he's pulled at halftime at Dallas. There are reports 
Davis sent a note to the dressing room, ordering it. Plunkett comes off the 
bench and throws two touchdown passes to Dokie Williams to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
The eighth victory is recorded at San Diego. Allen wins it with a 29-yard 
touchdown run in overtime, dragging several Chargers across the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
The playoffs appear a lock. The Raiders will play three of their final four at 
home, including games with the lowly Eagles and Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles stun them, 33-27 in overtime. With the winning field goal in sight, 
Allen fumbles at the Eagle 12 and a defensive back runs it back into the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders go to Seattle for what is now a big game. The night before, a 
couple of team officials ask Hawkins, the most indomitable of players, if the 
team is ready. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins shrugs and says they have no chance up here. Give that man a cigar. 
They lose, 37-0. 
</P>
<P>
They drop their next two, at home to the Kansas City Chiefs and Colts, finish 
8-8, and miss the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
1987 
</P>
<P>
Excitable Rusty Hilger takes over at quarterback and plays erratically in 
victories over the doormat Packers and Lions. 
</P>
<P>
The strike ensues. The Raiders field a powerful strike team, with Vince Evans 
and vets Howie Long and Bill Pickel, but are upset by Denver's no-names. A week 
later, Evans throws a game-losing interception to San Diego's Elvis Patterson. 
When the strikers return, the team is 3-2 instead of the 5-0 it expected, and 
everyone in angry at everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
It shows. The Raiders lose seven in a row. 
</P>
<P>
An official is heard in the press box at Minnesota, saying, "Mr. Davis wants a 
new quarterback." Exit Hilger, hello Marc Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson helps end the streak with his 221-yard game at, of all places, 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson leads a 34-21 wipeout of improved Buffalo a week later. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly bursting with momentum, the Raiders wonder if they can finish a 
respectable 8-7? 
</P>
<P>
Nope. Jackson goes back to Kansas City where his baseball fans feel betrayed 
and boo him. He sprains an ankle, runs off to the dressing room to be treated 
but returns for only a few plays. The Raiders lose. Jackson doesn't play at all 
in season-ending home losses to the Browns and Bears. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders finish 5-10, their worst record in the Davis era. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance plummets to 53,727. 
</P>
<P>
1988 
</P>
<P>
Tom Flores resigns as coach, not under pressure, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Davis goes outside the organization for the first time for a coach: Denver 
assistant Mike Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, whose contract is up, is waived after refusing to attend minicamp. 
</P>
<P>
Davis wheels and deals. He gets Willie Gault and Jim Lachey, trades Lachey for 
quarterback Jay Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder struggles. The Raiders stumble to 7-8, but need only beat Seattle in 
the finale at the Coliseum to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
They lose, 43-37. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance comes back only to 57,480. 
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
Unsettling reports precede the season: Davis is talking to Oakland and 
Sacramento; Davis is unhappy with Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders go 0-4 in exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
After they beat the lowly Chargers in their opener at home, a taut Shanahan 
says they'd had their "backs to the wall." 
</P>
<P>
At 1-3, Davis, who has never fired a coach, cans Shanahan after 20 games and 
appoints Art Shell. 
</P>
<P>
The players rejoice at a return to the Raider Way. With Bo Jackson running 
wild, they start 4-1 under Shell, losing only when Jeff Jaeger misses a couple 
of medium-range field goals at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
With two games left, they're 8-6. One more victory will put them in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
They lose at Seattle and in the Meadowlands to the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance drops to 51,000. 
</P>
<P>
1990 
</P>
<P>
Davis finally announces his choice: Oakland, but probably not until 1992.

<P>
TAGLIABUE'S PLEA HELPS SAVE INSTANT REPLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ORLANDO, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's impassioned plea to the NFL's club owners to keep 
instant replay officiating saved it Monday, owners said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us went into the meeting to vote it down," Ed McCaskey, board chairman 
of the Chicago Bears, said. "And our club voted against it as planned. But 
Paul's sensational pitch changed the minds of about 15 others. 
</P>
<P>
"There'll be instant replay again this year thanks to Paul and (New Orleans 
General Manager) Jim Finks, who both said just the right things." 
</P>
<P>
Considered dead 24 hours earlier when five of the seven members of the 
competition committee voted against it, replay officiating was authorized for 
another season after six hours of debate at the NFL's annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
Needing 21 votes, it won, 21-7. The votes against came from Cincinnati, 
Buffalo, Phoenix, Chicago, Tampa Bay, Kansas City and the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't have passed without the two-minute amendment," Finks said, 
referring to a stipulation that, this year, the replay official must reverse a 
call within two minutes or let it stand. 
</P>
<P>
Said Tagliabue: "This countered one of the big objections -- a perception that 
(replay officiating) takes too much time. Actually, replays added an average of 
only 1 minute 55 seconds to last year's games." 
</P>
<P>
The league is considering plans to install a two-minute clock in each stadium 
to keep fans informed. It would be the fourth clock in most stadiums -- added 
to the 60-minute clock, the 45-second clock and the one that tells the time of 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue said that in urging continued replay officiating, he pointed out 
that, nationwide, it ends controversy over four or five calls each week. 
</P>
<P>
"There are enough disputes as it is," he said. "It's got to help the league to 
get rid of four or five admittedly wrong calls every Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
That logic didn't work on the Giants. "Replay (officiating) is still a bad 
idea," said Wellington Mara, Giant president. 
</P>
<P>
But Tagliabue ended the debate on several other clubs -- those on which the 
coach and owner were on opposite sides. 
</P>
<P>
At Seattle, for instance, President Tom Flores, a new member of the competition 
committee, urged a no vote. Coach Chuck Knox is for it. The Tagliabue speech 
swung Flores into the yes column. 
</P>
<P>
"Instant replay isn't perfect, but it helps," Knox said. "Take the case of the 
wide receiver who might or might not be juggling the ball as he steps on the 
sideline -- or just inside the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"It's humanly impossible for one (official) to watch the receiver's hands and 
feet at the same time. There are a lot of cases like that where instant replay 
is your only recourse." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Knox has concluded that instant replay doesn't add to the length of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the penalties," he said. "Every penalty that any official calls adds a 
minute to the game. The thing you really have to do is upgrade your officials 
every season." 
</P>
<P>
To Finks, that's easier to talk about than do. 
</P>
<P>
"Our game is getting more difficult to officiate all the time," Finks said. 
"The players keep getting bigger, the rules keep changing, bodies are flying 
around faster than ever. We need instant replay because any help we can give 
the officials is a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue said that when the NFL polled its referees and other officials this 
winter, 60% favored the use of instant replay. According to previous estimates, 
only about 25% were in favor -- but there have been other indications that many 
are accepting it as an aid. 
</P>
<P>
One problem with the new rule is that, in the view of some coaches, replay 
officials will be tempted to use all of their allotted two minutes every time 
they stop the game to look at a play. 
</P>
<P>
"That could happen," said Bill Polian, general manager of the Buffalo Bills and 
also a new member of the competition committee. "But that's why we only put it 
in for a one-year trial. Keep in mind, the time limitation was the key to the 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, Norman Braman, another replay opponent 
who voted for it in the end, said it was the second year in a row that a 
commissioner has used persuasion to get a yea vote on replay officiating 
against the wishes of most clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept it last year as a favor to the outgoing commissioner, Pete Rozelle," 
Braman said. "Right now, we're still in the honeymoon period for his successor, 
Paul Tagliabue -- and we gave Paul what he wanted. Next year, it won't be such 
an emotional decision." 
</P>
<P>
Next year, it might not pass.

NCAA BASKETBALL NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
OKLAHOMA STATE PLAYER SUSPENDED FOR FIGHTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oklahoma State Coach Leonard Hamilton suspended John Potter from the team 
Monday for Potter's role in a fight that broke out at the end of the Cowboys' 
loss to Colorado in the Big Eight tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"This is certainly an unfortunate situation," Hamilton said. "We do not condone 
this kind of action and will take whatever steps are necessary to prevent 
something like this from ever happening again." 
</P>
<P>
The suspension was effective immediately and will cover Oklahoma State's 
first-round National Invitation Tournament game against Tulsa at Stillwater, 
Okla., on Thursday. The length of the suspension hadn't been determined. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said Potter has written a letter of apology to Colorado Coach Tom 
Miller and the team. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville Coach Denny Crum said that too much attention is being focused on 
center Felton Spencer's arrest for reckless driving in south-central Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
"If it'd been anybody who wasn't involved with athletics, there would have been 
no questions asked, period," Crum said. "It just would have been someone in a 
speeding violation, and that's all there would have been to it." 
</P>
<P>
A police officer reported driving 90 m.p.h. to catch up with Spencer, who was 
briefly jailed Sunday after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Coach Digger Phelps, despite his team's 16-12 record, obviously 
thinks the NCAA selection committee was justified in picking the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame, which will play Virginia (19-11) in the Southeast Regional at 
Richmond, Va., Friday night, had two losses to DePaul in the final month of the 
season. But the Irish had upset victories over Syracuse and Missouri over the 
same period. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of eyes were opened (by those victories)," Phelps said. "That, 
and the fact that last year we played well in the first and second rounds." 
</P>
<P>
Virginia, playing at Richmond, and Connecticut, playing at Hartford, Conn., 
would seem to have advantages. But playing close to home isn't always a plus in 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
For the best evidence, there was the 1979 East Regional in Raleigh, N.C., the 
heart of Atlantic Coast Conference territory. Duke and North Carolina were 
waiting there and both got stung -- the Blue Devils by St. John's and the Tar 
Heels by Penn. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Kentucky lost in the regional semifinals to Duke at Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Tulsa lost a second-round game to Houston at Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Syracuse was bounced out by Navy in the Carrier Dome on its own campus 
and Georgia Tech played in the East Regional at the Omni in Atlanta, only to be 
eliminated by Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Idaho lost in Boise, Ida., Texas lost in Dallas, Ball State lost in 
Indianapolis and East Tennessee State and Middle Tennessee State both lost in 
Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Mack, a transfer from Iowa State who was sitting out the season, was 
dropped from the Arizona State team. 
</P>
<P>
He and Coach Bill Frieder declined to comment on the reasons for Mack's 
dismissal. Frieder said it related to Mack's "performance outside the program." 
</P>
<P>
Mack was charged with robbery and kidnaping a year ago in the holdup of a 
fast-food restaurant in Ames, Iowa. But he was acquitted by a jury, which 
convicted a football player for the Cyclones in the same incident. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has put the Marshall University men's basketball team on two years' 
probation and barred it from postseason play next year, but said the school 
avoided stiffer penalties because it turned itself in. 
</P>
<P>
The university reported 10 violations to the NCAA a year ago -- including gifts 
to recruits, free housing and other benefits -- after an in-house 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma is No. 1 going into the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
While a lot of moving and shaking went on below them, the Sooners received 57 
first-place votes and 1,590 points, finishing first in the final Associated 
Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
It was second consecutive week atop the poll for Oklahoma (26-4). 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Las Vegas finished No. 2, Connecticut No. 3, and Michigan State No. 4.

ANOTHER NO. 44 COLLAPSED, DIED FIVE DAYS BEFORE GATHERS; 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS MEDICINE: AMERICAN'S DEATH IN ENGLAND REAFFIRMS DILEMMA FACED BY DOCTORS 
TREATING ATHLETES.

<P>
The circumstances were uncanny. They were 6-foot-7 basketball players. They 
were 23 years old. They wore No. 44. They collapsed during games and died five 
days apart. 
</P>
<P>
Victims of heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Penny, formerly a Central Connecticut State player, died Feb. 27 in a 
Manchester, England, hospital after collapsing during a game. 
</P>
<P>
But the similarities to the death of Loyola Marymount's Hank Gathers don't end 
there. Penny's death, too, exposes the pressures physicians face when caring 
for athletes who want nothing more than to return to the games they love. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Milton J. Sands, a cardiologist at New Britain, Conn., General Hospital, 
understands this dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
He was sued for $1 million last May for disallowing Penny from playing in 1986. 
Although Penny dropped the suit in December, Sands remains affected by the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamed I would have been sued to protect a life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sands said he empathizes with Gathers' physicians -- Michael Mellman and Vernon 
Hattori -- who might be named as defendants in a suit expected to be filed this 
week in Los Angeles Superior Court on behalf of Gathers' family. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors find themselves in the midst of controversy involving questions 
about how the Loyola star, a probable first-round NBA draft choice, could be 
allowed to play if he suffered from heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
Sands said his dilemma was whether to take care of his patient physically by 
not allowing him to play or to take care of him psychologically by approving 
his return. 
</P>
<P>
"Psychologically, it was difficult because the one thing he cared about almost 
more than life itself was basketball," Sands said. "To not allow him to play 
was to do a disservice." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to that immense pressure were calls from the Central Connecticut 
coaching staff, calls Sands termed as subtle reminders as to Penny's importance 
to the team. 
</P>
<P>
"They would ask, 'How's he doing? We really need him. When do you think he 
could get back to play?' " Sands said. "Then the university was asking the same 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Although Penny averaged only 2.5 points, he was the team's leading rebounder 
and a defensive enforcer in his senior year. He started 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors are trying to do the best they can for the athlete," Sands said. 
"The conflict is tremendous. Team members and friends were calling. They all 
wanted the same thing: 'When are we gonna get Tony back?' " 
</P>
<P>
Sands treated Penny in 1986 when the basketball player was brought to the 
hospital after an apparent heart attack. Penny, then 19, complained of chest 
pains after lifting weights. 
</P>
<P>
He had played a dozen games during the 1985-86 season when he was found to have 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is the enlargement of heart and thickening 
of its muscles. Sands told him to play was to risk death. 
</P>
<P>
Penny did not play. He stayed at Central Connecticut on scholarship, studying 
toward a dual degree in communications and psychology, which he later earned. 
He coached incoming freshmen. But for two seasons he missed the game. 
</P>
<P>
Penny, whose parents are from the Caribbean island of St. Kitts, returned to 
England before his senior year and decided to seek the opinion of a London 
cardiologist. She and a colleague said he could play, explaining that the 
condition was normal for black West Indian males. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to Sands armed with medical evidence of his health. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony was convinced that he was feeling fine," said David Rybczyk, assistant 
coach for Central Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
Sands would not budge. But the university was more flexible. After all, it had 
varying opinions from respected physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Penny was allowed to play under an agreement arranged by his attorney and the 
Connecticut state attorney general's office. He had to sign a waiver releasing 
the university from liability and undergo stress tests periodically to ensure 
he was healthy. When he skipped a test before the final game of the 1988-90 
season, he was not allowed to play. 
</P>
<P>
Letting him play "was probably the wrong thing to do," Sands said. "I never 
wanted to be right like this." 
</P>
<P>
Rybczyk said he was shocked when he heard of Gathers' death March 4 after he 
collapsed during Loyola Marymount's West Coast Conference tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just getting over that grieving process when Hank Gathers suffered the 
same thing and it brings it right back again," Rybczyk said. 
</P>
<P>
Penny had collapsed the night of Feb. 27 on the bench after playing eight 
minutes for the Manchester Giants of the English professional league. His coach 
said he was reaching his potential and had started the past four games. 
</P>
<P>
Then it happened. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony was not reckless," Rybczyk said. "Tony was convinced nothing was wrong 
with him. He told me if he found out he had it he was willing to live with it."

A NEW GENERATION OF CELLULAR TELEPHONES ENVISIONED; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNICATION: COMPANY'S DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE SERVICE, 
INCREASE CAPACITY AND MAKE THE DEVICE MORE AFFORDABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

When comic strip hero Dick Tracy needed to call the police chief, he never 
bothered rifling through his pockets for loose change. The famous detective 
simply pushed a few buttons on his two-way wrist radio and, voila, he had 
headquarters on the line. 
</P>
<P>
The comic strip's creators could not have known just how sophisticated 
telephone communications would become in the 1990s. But a young San Diego 
telecommunications company is developing technology that some say will herald a 
new generation of cellular telephones that could make Dick Tracy-like 
communication affordable to the masses. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Communication Sciences is working on a digital voice processor that 
could allow cellular service providers to squeeze more conversations onto the 
already crowded cellular radio waves and thereby bring down the cost of owning 
and using portable and mobile phones. 
</P>
<P>
The 70-employee company, founded in 1987, is by no means the only one working 
on digital technology. But it achieved a major coup earlier this month when it 
landed a $2-million contract with Uniden America, the U.S. subsidiary of Uniden 
Japan, one of the world's largest cellular phone manufacturers. The contract 
calls for Pacific Communication Sciences to create an integrated circuit-based 
voice processor that will go inside Uniden's new digital cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
If successful, the contract could give Pacific Communication Sciences a 
strategic connection to industry leader Uniden and lead to millions of dollars 
in business, either from licensing its technology or manufacturing components, 
said Michael L. Lubin, executive vice president and co-founder. 
</P>
<P>
The technological leap the cellular phone may soon take would improve service, 
increase capacity and eventually make the expensive device affordable to a much 
broader market, engineers and industry analysts say. The advance involves a 
digital voice-processing technology that is much more efficient than the 
analog-based system now used in cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
"Digital is the wave of the future," said telecommunications analyst Fred Moran 
of Moran &amp; Associates in Greenwich, Conn. "The costs (of cellular phones 
and service) would come down even without it, but, with digital, they will be 
able to provide services to everyone. Eventually, they'll all be digital." 
</P>
<P>
The $2.5-billion cellular telephone industry nationwide is expected to expand 
substantially when the price of owning and operating a cellular phone comes 
down. The number of cellular phone subscribers, now estimated at about 3.5 
million nationwide, is expected to grow to as many as 20 million by 1995, 
according to a study by Herschel Shosteck Associates in Silver Spring, Md. 
</P>
<P>
The development of digital technology is key to being able to put that many 
people on the system, Shosteck said. Any company that wants to stay in the 
cellular industry is looking toward the digital revolution, he said. But the 
number of companies with the technical competence to make that transition is 
surprisingly small, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"You have an analogy with what happened to long-distance and international 
rates when (U.S.) Sprint came onto the market with optic fiber cable," Shosteck 
said. "Today, people use the long-distance network 10 times more, and carriers 
have had a fourfold increase in revenue." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the new technology, cellular phone users in major metropolitan 
areas will be less likely to get busy signals when trying to make a cellular 
call during peak hours. The new telephones, which eventually will require a 
complete revamping of the costly cellular ground systems now in place, could be 
available for sale as early as 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what you're seeing is the first step toward true personal 
communications, meaning that your telephone can accompany you wherever you want 
to go," said David Lyon, president of Pacific Communication Sciences. "What 
market researchers tell us is that once any of the system manufacturers add 
digital, almost all of the (cellular phone service providers) will demand to 
add this capacity. It will have an avalanche effect." 
</P>
<P>
For now, the cost of cellular phone service is beyond the reach of most people. 
Local providers charge their customers 40 cents a minute during weekday peak 
hours. That rate, combined with a $35-a-month service charge, means a typical 
customer ends up paying more than $100 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The price of cellular phones, however, has dropped significantly. In 1983, the 
lowest-priced phone cost $2,600, Shosteck said. Six years later, the same phone 
costs about $525. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting the high cost of cellular phones was one of the challenges that spurred 
five ex-M/A-COM Linkabit engineers to found Pacific Communication Sciences in 
April, 1987. When M/A-COM's telecommunications division decided to sell off a 
satellite project the engineers had helped develop from scratch, they decided 
to leave and start their own business. 
</P>
<P>
"When it became clear we didn't know where our future was going, we decided we 
wanted a little more control over our destiny," Lyon said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Communication Sciences' revenue is now running at an annualized rate of 
$6 million.

KOLL DEAL WITH UNION PACIFIC IS DERAILED; 
</P>
<P>
ACQUISITION: THE RAILROAD HOLDING COMPANY REJECTED THE DEVELOPER'S FINANCING 
PACKAGE FOR ITS REAL ESTATE UNIT.

<P>
The Koll Co. said Monday that its attempt to acquire a real estate unit from 
Union Pacific Corp. for $532 million had fallen through because the railroad 
holding company rejected the developer's financing package. 
</P>
<P>
The two firms tentatively agreed to the huge real estate transaction involving 
more than 15,000 acres and 30 industrial buildings in early December. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been the largest real estate deal ever for Newport Beach-based 
Koll. 
</P>
<P>
"The financing package that Koll Co. put together was not acceptable to Union 
Pacific," said Koll spokesman Martin Brower. 
</P>
<P>
He said he could not comment on the specific areas of concern in the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for Union Pacific -- parent of the nation's second-largest 
railroad firm, Omaha-based Union Pacific Railroad -- said that Koll was unable 
to raise the necessary financing by the deadline last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"They were unable to come up with the financing within the required period of 
time," Union Pacific spokesman Marvin Zim told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
When originally announcing the deal, Koll identified UBS Securities, a 
subsidiary of United Bank of Switzerland, as its lender. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it planned to acquire the property with a partner, which it 
declined to identify. 
</P>
<P>
Koll planned to acquire most of the assets of Union Pacific Realty, a division 
that managed land holdings for the parent corporation, in at least 19 states, 
mostly in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Zim said the assets of Dallas-based Union Pacific Realty are still for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Union Pacific authorized the sale of the real estate assets last April, saying 
it wanted to focus on its transportation operations. 
</P>
<P>
Koll, one of the West Coast's largest property owners, negotiated with Union 
Pacific for several months and agreed to acquire the vast tracts of mostly 
industrial property. 
</P>
<P>
Koll officials said the company intended to develop most of the real estate. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed acquisition would have added substantially to Koll's holdings in 
the West, but would also have given it a toehold in several eastern markets, 
including Washington, D.C. The company has expressed an interest in expanding 
into the East. 
</P>
<P>
The deal included three large industrial parks in Southern California, 
industrial land in several Northern California cities, an industrial park near 
Seattle, an office building and land just outside Washington, and five 
buildings and 1,100 acres near Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Privately held Koll says it owns about $4 billion in real estate on the West 
Coast, much of it acquired since the company began to buy buildings in the 
early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The company's previous largest deal came in 1989 when it bought $300 million in 
property from Wells Fargo Mortgage &amp; Equity Trust.

CYCLE, STS FORM LARGEST T-SHIRT SCREEN PRINTING FIRM;

<P>
CLOTHING: MERGER WILL COMBINE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE 
OF THE BEACHWEAR AND GRAPHICS COMPANIES.

T-shirt and beachwear manufacturer Cycle Industries Inc. said Monday that it 
has acquired STS Graphics of Anaheim for an undisclosed price, creating the 
largest T-shirt screen printing firm in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The consolidation will "bring synergies" to the two companies, combining 
manufacturing operations and management expertise, said Cycle spokesman 
Jonathan Edelstein. Together, the two companies have retail sales of more than 
$200 million annually and command 10% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
"We now have top market share in a primary industry segment and with it, the 
foundation for strong future growth," Edelstein said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Cycle plans to move its equipment and staff into STS' building in Anaheim. No 
layoffs are planned among management or workers in the combined work force of 
about 1,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Cycle, which holds the license for the popular Hobie and Catchit label 
T-shirts, manufactures its own Off Shore, Lineshots and Team Gear USA labels 
with an eye toward the volleyball, skiing and surfing markets. 
</P>
<P>
STS prints Ocean Pacific Sunwear Ltd.'s line of T-shirts, as well as images of 
the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the leading children's characters seen on 
television, comic books and video games. The firm also produces T-shirts with 
the Newport Blue label. 
</P>
<P>
The merger is hardly a pairing of strangers. Both companies courted financial 
backing from a Merrill Lynch subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch Interfunding bought a large share of Cycle in 1988, and now with 
the consolidation of the two firms will have an interest in both. 
</P>
<P>
The linkage between the two is so close that Daniel Little, who started STS 
Graphics 20 years ago in the garage of his parents' San Fernando Valley house, 
said he gave away the lucrative Hobie label to Cycle Industries about a decade 
ago to avoid a conflict in sales of the Ocean Pacific T-shirts his firm 
manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
Little, who plans to remain active in the combined company's management, said 
his firm was instrumental in getting department stores to sell T-shirts with 
printed designs in their sportswear departments, rather than relegating them to 
shelves with underwear.

THE RUB IN A HAIR REMEDY; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: DOES A DRUG THAT BATTLES BALDNESS FULFILL A MAJOR HEALTH CONCERN, OR 
HAS IT SIMPLY BECOME THE FOCUS OF A SLICK MARKETING CAMPAIGN? 
</P>

When Howard Hintz looks in the mirror every morning, he sees a guy with a full 
head of hair. Maybe it's not quite as thick on top as it was when he was 18, 
but neither is it as thin as it was a few years ago -- and Hintz has a morning 
and evening ritual to keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll continue to use it until something else comes along. Or until I get to a 
point where I'm too old to be bothered," said the 31-year-old Los Angeles chef. 
</P>
<P>
The secret to Hintz's rebound from baldness is minoxidil, rubbed in the scalp 
twice a day. Under the brand name Rogaine, the drug has been touted over the 
last year as "the first and only product that's proven to grow hair." 
</P>
<P>
It's a product to meet a health need that is more mental than physical, and 
American men have been slow to accept it. But there has been a slow, steady 
increase of Rogaine users, including some women who were losing their hair 
because of genetics or medical treatments. 
</P>
<P>
From its beginnings in sober medical propriety 1 1/2 years ago, Upjohn Co.'s 
marketing campaign for Rogaine has moved from aiming at doctors to directly 
appealing to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
On the sports pages and on posters at the barbershop or hair salon, American 
men are seeing explicit ads about what Rogaine can do for them. 
</P>
<P>
In a twis t on supermarket coupons for cereal and cat food, the ads even 
contain a coupon worth $10 toward the cost of visiting a doctor for a Rogaine 
prescription. 
</P>
<P>
And the recent Los Angeles Marathon featured a 5-K run sponsored by Rogaine: 
its first move into sports sponsorship to get name recognition for a cosmetic 
that can be sold by prescription only. 
</P>
<P>
A product that was seen as a sure-fire hit before it received FDA approval in 
August, 1988, Rogaine began looking like a pharmaceutical Edsel in the first 
few months after Upjohn made it available in November of that year. Sales that 
some market analysts had predicted would hit $200 million in the first year 
totaled less than a third of that in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In short, it has taken some work to persuade American men to spend at least 
$600 a year for a vanity product they must use for their lifetimes. Most 
pharmacies fill only a handful of Rogaine prescriptions each month. 
</P>
<P>
One of the notable exceptions is -- where else? -- in the center of Southern 
California's good-looks industry, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Fine Pharmacy, 433 N. Roxbury Drive, Beverly Hills, sells at least 144 
bottles of Rogaine every month, said owner Ted Buchalter. He estimates that 10% 
of those bottles go to women. 
</P>
<P>
The men, who don't like to admit they're using Rogaine, "are mostly yuppies, 
young executives, people who are in a position where they have to make the good 
appearance. If they get bald, they look a little older," Buchalter said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, at the hair transplant center of the Bosley Medical Group, 8447 
Wilshire Blvd., patients use about 100 bottles of minoxidil a week, said clinic 
administrator Charles Ihling. The drug is thought to promote hair growth that 
the trauma of the transplant operation might temporarily disrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Seven other centers in California and three other states bring the Bosley 
Medical Group's monthly consumption to about 1,000 bottles, Ihling said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been told by Upjohn that we're the No. 2 purchaser of Rogaine in 
California and among the top 10 in the United States," Ihling said. 
</P>
<P>
Upjohn will not release sales figures, saying only that 2 million men worldwide 
have tried Rogaine. 
</P>
<P>
What that doesn't say is how many men quit using the drug because it didn't 
seem to work or because -- once confronted by having to rub it on twice a day, 
forever, and at a cost of about $50 a month -- men decide they'd rather go 
bald. Dr. Rhonda Rand, a Beverly Hills dermatologist, said about half of her 
patients who try Rogaine stick with it. 
</P>
<P>
Minoxidil has been used in the United States since 1980 to lower blood 
pressure. When doctors testing the drug in the early 1970s noticed that some 
men taking the pills started growing hair on their heads and upper cheeks, 
Upjohn began researching it as a baldness remedy. 
</P>
<P>
The tests found the drug useful against male pattern baldness, the hereditary 
type that begins at the top of the head and can eventually leave a man with 
only a horseshoe-shaped fringe of hair around his head. About 30 million 
American men have some degree of male pattern baldness. 
</P>
<P>
The study concluded that 39% of men experienced moderate to dense hair 
regrowth; 37% had minimal regrowth; 13% grew only small, soft, colorless hair, 
and 11% had no regrowth. 
</P>
<P>
The studies also showed that minoxidil requires a four- to six-month commitment 
of twice-daily applications before early results can be seen. And, although 
early hairs often resemble "peach fuzz," sometimes they are replaced later by 
more normal-appearing hairs. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier in the balding process a man is, the better the results seem to be. 
And, even when hair doesn't become denser, some men find that minoxidil "holds 
the line" against further hair loss. Once minoxidil treatment is stopped, 
though, balding will begin again. 
</P>
<P>
The current formulation is a 2% solution of minoxidil, but Upjohn recently 
launched a study of whether increasing the concentration to 5% would improve 
the results, said Kaye Bennett, spokeswoman for the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Some doctors also tell their patients to use minoxidil in conjunction with 
Retin A, the "anti-aging" drug. 
</P>
<P>
The major side effect from Rogaine is skin irritation, which occurs in about 5% 
of men. Because minoxidil is absorbed through the skin, close monitoring is 
needed if Rogaine is used by a man with hypertension, coronary heart disease or 
a predisposition to heart failure. Its use should be avoided by pregnant or 
nursing women. 
</P>
<P>
Before Rogaine was approved, American men were spending about $200 million a 
year on various remedies for hair loss, Upjohn says. In January, the FDA banned 
the promotion of various long-standing over-the-counter remedies for baldness, 
calling them ineffective -- and leaving Rogaine as the only approved 
nonsurgical alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Surgical options include transplanting small plugs of hair from the back of the 
head to the top, moving flaps of hair over balding areas, and scalp reduction 
surgery that decreases the bare area. 
</P>
<P>
Although Upjohn and others are researching the mechanism of minoxidil's action, 
no one is sure how it works. Male pattern baldness is known, however, to result 
from hair follicles reacting abnormally to the presence of androgens, male sex 
hormones. 
</P>
<P>
Another drug currently being tested for its hair restoration properties, 
Cyoctol, acts against androgens. A very small study for a Los Angeles firm 
showed that Cyoctol blocked the action of testosterone on the scalp, preserving 
the hair, but further studies are needed. 
</P>
<P>
Women could present the market of the future for Rogaine because they are more 
concerned when hair loss occurs and more likely than men to consult doctors, 
drug market analysts believe. 
</P>
<P>
"It would more than double the market," said Richard Stover, who analyzes the 
drug market for Alex Brown &amp; Sons Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Early results of Upjohn tests indicate that hair growth in women with thinning 
hair was 50% better with minoxidil than with a placebo. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, women already play an important role in the market, even when they 
aren't using Rogaine themselves, some say. 
</P>
<P>
Many inquiries about the drug come from women who are asking on behalf of 
husbands who are too embarrassed to call attention to their baldness, said 
Dianne Narron, a Raleigh, N.C., hairdresser. Narron chairs an education 
committee for the National Cosmetology Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It tickles me. A lot of mothers whose sons are college-age or older ask about 
Rogaine," Narron said. "One lady noticed her son was getting some hair loss and 
offered to pay for it if he would go to the doctor. She thought he had such a 
wonderful head of hair and, if something could help it, then she wanted him to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Upjohn gives hairdressers posters and other information about Rogaine as a way 
to help them advise customers about the drug. 
</P>
<P>
But, even as advertising tries to convince men that their baldness is something 
to treat medically, UCLA health researcher Michael S. Goldstein suggests that 
men's slowness to accept Rogaine is one of the few positive byproducts of men's 
reluctance to consult doctors. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the research on men's health habits tends to make men look bad, 
because they don't respond to (medical) symptoms," Goldstein said. "But hair 
loss isn't a genuine symptom in the way it's commonly thought about. It's a 
created symptom and a need that's being artificially created. So if men aren't 
responding, it's a sign of their mental health, not ill health." 
</P>
<P>
Upjohn's latest effort to woo male customers is a new television commercial 
being tested this month in Youngstown, Ohio; Rochester, N.Y., and New Orleans. 
It is the first time Rogaine's name is being mentioned in a broadcast 
advertisement, said Upjohn spokeswoman Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
Previous attempts talked about a new medical remedy for baldness but did not 
name the drug. The new ads talk about Rogaine but aren't specific about what 
it's for. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA requires that if both the name of the product and the condition it 
treats are mentioned, the ad must also contain details about the drug's 
effectiveness and side effects. In print ads, this is solved with masses of 
fine print, but that option is not practical for TV. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate solution to this advertising dilemma -- and a boon for men worried 
about baldness -- would come if the FDA approves making topical minoxidil an 
over-the-counter medication. Market analyst Stover says there is a "high 
probability" of this happening by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, many companies could market anti-baldness minoxidil solutions, 
but Rogaine would have the name recognition that Bayer has for aspirin or 
Tylenol has for acetaminophen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, men will have to consult a doctor before they can obtain Rogaine to 
see if it works for them. Because the results vary from man to man, Howard 
Hintz advises men to come to terms with the idea of being bald before trying 
Rogaine: 
</P>
<P>
"You shouldn't do something when you're crazed about it, but when you're more 
or less comfortable with going bald. Then if it works, it works, and if it 
doesn't, it doesn't."

L.B.J.'S DARK YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
BIOGRAPHY: IN HIS SECOND VOLUME ON THE FORMER PRESIDENT, AUTHOR ROBERT CARO 
TAKES A BLEAK VIEW OF LYNDON JOHNSON'S LIFE FROM 1941 TO 1948 . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SANDOMIR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everything about Lyndon Baines Johnson was outsized. His physical bulk, his 
energy, his ambition, his tirades, his deceptions and even his ears made 
Johnson a political mega-force. 
</P>
<P>
No less forceful is the work of Robert Caro. The former newspaper reporter has 
labored for 14 years to turn the life of Johnson into what will be a 
four-volume biography that, he says, will tell the darkness-and-light tale of 
how a poor boy from the lonely Hill Country of Texas acquired power in 
Congress, became a millionaire, clawed his way to the U.S. Senate in a "stolen" 
election, ascended with alacrity to become Senate Majority Leader and twisted 
arms as President to turn his civil rights initiatives into law. 
</P>
<P>
Caro's L.B.J. in the newly published second volume, "Means of Ascent" (Alfred 
A. Knopf), is unrelentingly dark. There is none of the 
Johnson-as-the-boy-wonder depicted in the first volume, the young congressman 
who brought electricity to the 200,000 farmers and ranchers of his rural 
district. 
</P>
<P>
The L.B.J. in "Means of Ascent" angrily stalks through the bleakest wilderness 
of his life. 
</P>
<P>
But, like Johnson, the second volume of Caro's opus is ambitious and 
compelling. Even Horace Busby, a longtime Johnson adviser, who disagrees with 
Caro's savage evocation of the period, says: "My feeling is he's making the man 
a legend. Carl Sandburg would have to write another book about Lincoln to keep 
up with Caro." 
</P>
<P>
Knopf has dispatched 250,000 copies of "Means of Ascent" across the country, up 
from the original 200,000 first printing. The book is a main selection of the 
Book-of-the-Month-Club and six excerpts of it have appeared in the New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
Caro has spent seven years on each of his books: "Means of Ascent," "The Path 
to Power," which earned Caro the National Book Critics Circle award for 
nonfiction and "The Power Broker," Caro's Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of 
New York's master-builder, Robert Moses. He has also spent part of the past 14 
years on a novel about the newspaper business, which he left in 1967. All he 
will say of it is that "it is immense." 
</P>
<P>
Working with his wife, Ina, a medieval historian and his research assistant, 
Caro has spent months at a time in Texas, reading some of the 34 million papers 
in the Johnson Library in Austin and driving rented cars thousands of miles 
across the state for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
If possible, Caro wants to be where Johnson was, to visualize what molded his 
subject, much as Francis Parkman, the historian Caro admires most, did when 
writing about the American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
When Caro didn't comprehend Johnson's upbringing in the lonely Hill Country and 
residents didn't trust that the city boy with the New York accent was committed 
to knowing them, he and Ina moved near them for parts of three years. He gained 
their trust and their unembellished memories. 
</P>
<P>
When he wanted to understand the area's loneliness, he took a sleeping bag and 
camped out on a ranch for four days, waiting as Lyndon and his brother, Sam, 
once waited for a car to come by so they'd have somebody to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
In 14 years of studying his subject at the Johnson Library, 787 document boxes 
filled with notes, memoranda, letters, telephone transcripts and speeches -- 
altogether about 629,000 pages of documents, have been delivered to Caro in the 
eighth-floor research room. 
</P>
<P>
Caro says he has dug deeper and wider than any biographer (there have been 21 
others) to understand Johnson. "Everything in this book," Caro says, "is true 
and documented beyond the possibility of any doubt. That's just the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
What Caro covers in "Means of Ascent" is a seven-year period in Johnson's life, 
from 1941 to 1948, when the future President saw his way blocked to power in 
the House of Representatives and election to the Senate. He had lost a special 
1941 Senate election and reluctantly stayed out of the 1942 race, to follow 
through on a promise to fight in "the trenches" if war brought out. 
</P>
<P>
He was no longer the pet of House Speaker Sam Rayburn or a President's southern 
protege after Franklin Roosevelt's death in 1945. He craved influence and 
money, but had neither. As he eyed the 1948 Senate election, Caro writes, it 
was "all or nothing." If Johnson lost, he'd return to a life he dreaded, to 
being ordinary and poor, like his daddy. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnson of Caro's uncompromising portrait of these years "is unrelieved by 
redeeming social values," says Robert Gottlieb, the editor of the New Yorker, 
who has edited all of Caro's books for Knopf. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a picture corroborated by Johnson confidants like John Connally and 
Horace Busby -- who admit they can't fault Caro's reporting, just his 
conclusions. Connally, former governor of Texas and secretary of the treasury, 
says: "For whatever reason, Caro has painted the dark side of Johnson without 
the benefit of the doubt on anything. Why I don't know. But the problem in 
arguing with Caro is it's impossible to dispute his facts. I don't argue the 
facts, but the nuances and interpretation." 
</P>
<P>
Caro shakes his head at Connally's remarks. Connally refused to speak to Caro 
until two years after the publication of "The Path to Power." Says Caro: "My 
interviews with him were four days of the most fascinating interviews I've ever 
had. When we started talking, he was enthusiastic about the book. But since he 
started his own book, that enthusiasm has lessened. He told me the reason he 
talked to me was because I had gotten Johnson 'right on the head' and he didn't 
want me to write any more volumes without him." 
</P>
<P>
Says Busby: "I'm not detracting from his work, but Johnson was a many-sided man 
who was difficult to capture. Caro doesn't deal with the extreme sensitivity of 
the man, and I was closer to that side of him than anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
From the start of his work, Caro's goal has been to separate legend from truth 
by speaking to people never interviewed before and pressing others to 
reconstruct events as they happened. Among the parts of the Johnson legend Caro 
disassembles: 
</P>
<P>
* Johnson's war service. After a desultory 10 weeks of inspecting shipyards for 
the Navy, a period enlivened only by parties and practical jokes, and after 
Roosevelt rebuffed him for high-level Washington desk jobs, Roosevelt sent 
Johnson to the Southwest Pacific to survey the war effort. While Johnson 
maintained that he played an important combat role, he was only an observer on 
a bomber that saw 13 minutes of action against Japanese Zero fighters. Gen. 
Douglas MacArthur awarded him the Silver Star. Back home, L.B.J. had the Silver 
Star pinned on him at public appearances, and became the increasingly heroic 
"Raider" Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
* Johnson's wealth. As President, Johnson maintained that the broadcasting 
empire that started with buying the KTBC radio station in Austin in 1943 was 
built by Lady Bird. He had nothing to do with it. But Caro shows that it was 
Johnson's influence with the FCC that helped buy the station, change it to 
full-day operation and shift it to a better frequency. It was Lyndon who won a 
CBS radio affiliation for KTBC, unavailable to a rival Austin station. It was 
Lyndon to whom influence-seeking local lawyers and businessmen came with open 
pockets to advertise. 
</P>
<P>
Caro intended "Means of Ascent" to carry Johnson up to John F. Kennedy's 
assassination in 1963, but he stopped in 1948, the year of Johnson's "stolen" 
victory in a Senate primary runoff. 
</P>
<P>
The primary campaign matched Johnson, running as if for his life, and Coke 
Stevenson, the stoic former three-term governor who never made promises or 
presented a campaign platform. Stevenson won the primary by 71,000 votes, but 
it wasn't enough to avoid a run-off. 
</P>
<P>
What happened next is why material that began as one chapter turned into 
two-thirds of Caro's book. 
</P>
<P>
"If I showed the 1948 campaign in depth, I could show things I've always wanted 
to show about American politics," says Caro. "I could show the full 
destructiveness of the new media politics on the political process. In Coke 
Stevenson, you had the old politics in a pure example. It was the end of an 
era; no one ever campaigned like this again in Texas. And here is Lyndon 
Johnson with his new politics and media manipulation. He didn't create the new 
politics, but he brought it to a new maturity." 
</P>
<P>
That the run-off was stolen is not disputed. But Caro disproves the myth that 
the votes filched in Johnson's name represented business as usual in Texas 
politics and that everybody did it -- even Coke Stevenson. Caro found that no 
race had ever witnessed a vote theft so massive, where thousands of votes 
shifted to Johnson for six days after balloting closed. Johnson's puny 87-vote 
margin of victory was contrived when the corrupt Rio Grande Valley political 
boss, George Parr, ordered Luis Salas, an election judge in Jim Wells County, 
to add 200 votes for Johnson. "If the votes were not for Johnson, "I make them 
for Johnson," Salas later said. 
</P>
<P>
Caro does not say Johnson directed the vote thefts. But he does not believe 
denials that L.B.J. lacked personal knowledge of what was being done in his 
name. 
</P>
<P>
"For 40 years, people didn't know what happened," says Caro, "and I said I 
wasn't going to write a biography of Lyndon Johnson where in the pivotal point 
in his career, I'm not going to know the truth." 
</P>
<P>
But it was not the election that tantalized Caro as much as Coke Stevenson, the 
symbol of the end of the old ways. In Stevenson, Caro found the perfect 
antithesis to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Caro wasn't prepared for Stevenson; he had barely heard of him until people who 
knew Johnson told stories of the cowboy governor's honesty. In the capital of 
Austin, Stevenson was known as the man who could not be bought. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1948 campaign, Johnson lied about Stevenson's positions; he 
insulted, mocked and aped him. Repetition was the key. But Stevenson wouldn't 
reply. Johnson's new politics trampled Stevenson's old politics. Unlimited cash 
let Johnson pound his message over the radio airwaves. Stevenson campaigned 
simply, driving into towns, giving speeches on courthouse steps. 
</P>
<P>
Connally says Caro "beatified" Stevenson to set up Johnson as "the man in the 
black hat. There was no balance at all. Stevenson was an old-style politician 
who was well-regarded; he sure wasn't all that beloved." 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't say anything about Stevenson's integrity, did he?" asks Caro. No. 
Caro nods, certain as ever, of the rightness of his portrait. 
</P>
<P>
Caro writes in an office on West 57th Street, not far from the apartment he and 
Ina, who were married 32 years ago, share on Central Park West. His workplace 
is spare: a stained white couch, dirty walls, unwashed windows, scratched wood 
bookcases, used file cabinets and a shabby desk. 
</P>
<P>
He arrives each morning about 8, but when thoughts rouse him from his sleep, 
he'll be at his desk before sunrise. He hates distractions; when he writes, he 
shuts off the telephone and answering machine. The mail slot on his door is 
blocked with a steel plate. 
</P>
<P>
He is an exacting perfectionist who doesn't think he's taking too much time to 
study Johnson and who believes that the truth takes time. He wonders why, after 
he's set down all the facts, people could disagree with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that while someone may quibble with me," he says, "they'd be wrong." 
</P>
<P>
For all his intensity and what Gottlieb calls "his free-floating anxiety," Caro 
is unfailingly polite and respectful. It's not difficult to visualize how Caro 
induces Johnson friends and intimates like lawyer Ed Clark, a Texas power for 
40 years, and contractor George Brown of Brown &amp; Root, which helped 
bankroll Johnson's campaigns -- men who had never talked to biographers or whom 
other biographers ignored -- to open up. 
</P>
<P>
"My models for interviewing are George Smiley and George Simenon's Inspector 
Maigrit," says Caro. "What distinguishes both is their empathy, how they 
understand what they're hearing rather than ask a lot of questions. I'm always 
writing 'shut up' to myself in the note pad." 
</P>
<P>
One Caro technique is to take interviewees back to key places to help them 
recall important moments in Johnson's life. In Volume One, he took Lyndon's 
brother, Sam Houston Johnson, back to the family home to re-create the searing 
arguments between Lyndon and their father. 
</P>
<P>
Caro almost always refuses to use a tape recorder, except for rare technical 
interviews. A wooden cabinet in his office stores precisely stacked piles of 
pads, each annotated on the cover with the people interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Many more notebooks will be filled before Caro is done. He is now writing about 
Johnson's Senate years in Volume Three, covering the period when Johnson became 
the most powerful majority leader in history. This time, threads of dark and 
light run together, as Johnson uses questionable means to pass early civil 
rights legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"His personality doesn't change," says Caro. "All the old traits, good and bad 
are there, but he's using them in a noble cause. To watch him tirelessly 
maneuver the civil rights legislation with his savage energy is fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
"If I portray him right," adds Caro, sitting on the edge of his couch, 
excitedly describing the work that lies before him, "we will never have to ask 
again what one aspect of political genius is. This is it. That's why I raise 
the relationship between ends and means. By the time you finish my four 
volumes, anyone who wants to talk about the relationship between ends and means 
will have the material." 
</P>
<P>
Caro has been observing Senate action from its overhead gallery and examining 
papers, memos, letters and telephone transcripts of Johnson's contemporaries. 
Caro says the most revealing information comes from the papers of lesser-known 
senators. "The story of how he came to power has never been told," he says, 
"because some of the collections have never been looked at." 
</P>
<P>
Caro is bluntly confident that he will come closer than any biographer to 
knowing the man who could muscle into law both the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution 
and the Voting Rights Act.

One person who disagrees with Caro's self-assurance is UCLA history professor 
Robert Dallek. He says that he's done the historical research that will yield a 
more accurate portrait of Johnson, which he will publish in two volumes, the 
first to be published late this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Caro is a muckraking investigative journalist who does a lot of interviewing, 
and he's painted a portrait of saints and sinners, with elements of cartoon and 
caricature," he says. "I've done interviews, but mine is based on 116 
manuscript collections. My books rest on the contemporary record more than the 
memories of people about events from 30 or 50 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Does Robert Caro hate Lyndon Johnson? No, says Caro. "Means of Ascent' was 
meant to be dark, but it is only seven years. Lyndon Johnson is not the sum of 
his actions between 1941 and 1948. His positive impulses, manifested in rural 
electrification in the 1930s and social justice legislation of the 1960s, did 
not emerge in this period. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to know this personality," says Caro. "It may be unpleasant to know. 
His presidency was a watershed in American history. The country changed. In a 
watershed, on the top of a divide; waters on one side run in one direction and 
on the other side, they run in the other direction. That was Lyndon Johnson's 
presidency. It wasn't solely because of his personality, but if you have a long 
list of factors why history changed during his presidency, the personality of 
this President has an unusually heavy weight in the equation. You have to 
understand that."

2 O.C. MEN NAMED IN MICROCHIP THEFT RING; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: FEDERAL INDICTMENT ALLEGES THAT SANTA ANA AND GARDEN GROVE RESIDENTS 
MOVED CHIPS STOLEN FROM AN OKLAHOMA CITY PLANT TO ORANGE COUNTY'S LITTLE 
SAIGON.

<P>
Two men suspected of heading a major crime ring based in Orange County's Little 
Saigon have been charged with stealing $3.7 million in computer chips, 
according to an indictment to be unsealed today in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment of Dinh Huu Tran, 33, of Santa Ana and Phat Viet Doan, 20, of 
Garden Grove stems from a 17-month interstate investigation by the Treasury 
Department and the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
The crime ring allegedly preyed on an AT&amp;T manufacturing facility in 
Oklahoma City, recruiting Vietnamese employees there to steal hundreds of 
thousands of chips by putting the tiny parts in their pockets and in tubes that 
were hidden under their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
The chips were then transported to the Orange County area by car and commercial 
jet and fenced through at least 30 Vietnamese-owned computer stores, Treasury 
Agent Paul Elledge said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"They did business throughout Orange County," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The AT&amp;T theft is the latest evidence of a network of Vietnamese gangs -- 
many of them based in Westminster and Garden Grove -- that have been linked to 
the growing problem of microchip thefts. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the thefts have been carried out in paramilitary-type operations. 
Bandits have struck some of Southern California's best-known computer 
companies, binding and gagging employees and threatening them with death. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing is so massive now that federal agencies are finally looking 
seriously at it," said Lee Roberts, a Santa Ana private investigator employed 
by several computer companies. 
</P>
<P>
The Oklahoma City indictment says that the thefts at AT&amp;T occurred between 
May, 1988, and January of last year. 
</P>
<P>
The two Orange County men are named in the indictment as the alleged leaders of 
the crime ring, which Elledge said involved at least 16 people. Further 
indictments are expected. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney's office in Oklahoma City has scheduled a press conference 
today to announce the indictments and explain the complicated scheme. The 
indictments were originally issued by a federal grand jury last month but 
placed under seal to give local law enforcement officials time to seek the two 
men. 
</P>
<P>
Tran and Doan are each charged with conspiracy, interstate transportation of 
stolen goods and multiple counts of money laundering. The two men, who each 
face 135 years in jail if convicted, were last seen at the Tet celebrations in 
Little Saigon at the end of January and are now considered fugitives, Elledge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tran's attorney, Nolan Stringfield, refused to comment, saying he had not seen 
the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged crime ring was first detected by Internal Revenue Service agents in 
August, 1988, after they noticed that hundreds of thousands of dollars were 
being moved between Oklahoma City and Orange County. They first suspected an 
illegal drug operation. 
</P>
<P>
"We normally investigate major narcotics cases," Elledge said. "We attempt to 
try and track the flow and movement of large amounts of currency. When we 
initially started this investigation, we thought it was probably 
narcotics-related because based on our experience, the only thing we knew that 
could generate such large amounts of money over a short period of time was 
drugs. We were quite far into the investigation before we discovered it was, in 
fact, microchips." 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities allege in the indictment that Doan and Tran started the 
crime ring, using the fictitious business name of C.D. Computer as a cover. 
</P>
<P>
The address given for C.D. Computer -- on Westminster Avenue in Santa Ana -- 
"was in fact a furniture store which belonged to Dinh Huu Tran," Elledge said 
in an affidavit which accompanies the indictment. "C.D. Computer did not have 
an office location." 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleges that Doan and Tran hired Son Manh Nguyen of Oklahoma 
City to persuade AT&amp;T employees to steal the chips. Nguyen is under 
investigation in connection with the scheme, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Doan then allegedly brought the stolen chips "from Oklahoma to California for 
distribution by the organization," according to the indictment. He allegedly 
earned $5 per chip for transporting them to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Tran and Doan, the indictment alleges, sold the AT&amp;T chips to numerous 
electronics shops in Little Saigon that police have said handle stolen chips 
and are a key cog in a vast international black market. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of middle men," Elledge said. "There are little computer 
companies on every block in Little Saigon." 
</P>
<P>
Elledge said the shops that bought the chips included P.H. Computer in Fountain 
Valley and Telecomputer Inc. in Westminster. Neither company has been charged 
with any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"If we did (buy the chips), we weren't aware of it," said Mark Walsh, a 
Telecomputer vice president. "We only deal with reputable dealers." 
</P>
<P>
PH Computer salesman Peter Chang denied that the company had purchased any 
stolen chips. 
</P>
<P>
Microchips -- which are used in everything from toasters to missiles -- make 
good booty because they are small but valuable. Just a handful can bring 
thousands of dollars and they are difficult to trace because few have serial 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T has not recovered a single chip stolen from its Oklahoma City plant. 
</P>
<P>
"This is better than moving dope," Elledge said. "If a cop stops you and you 
have a trunkload of chips, so what?" 
</P>
<P>
Tran opened six bank accounts in the Little Saigon area "for the purposes of 
receiving and distributing the proceeds of the stolen computer chips, and to 
obtain the needed currency to promote the carrying-on of the unlawful 
activity," the indictment alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Bank records show that Tran was moving around hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"They had to generate large amounts of cash to purchase the chips," Elledge 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
The crime ring allegedly bought microchips from AT&amp;T employees for 
approximately $6 apiece and then sold them for as much as $35 each, Elledge 
said. The Treasury Department apprehended 12 employees in the scheme as part of 
an undercover operation that led to Doan and Tran.

PLANS FOR ESTATE RILE NEIGHBORS; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE SPECTACULAR 10.4-ACRE BLUFF-TOP PROPERTY NEXT TO LAGUNA BEACH 
MAY BECOME THE SITE OF 26 CUSTOM HOUSES UNLESS PROTESTING NEIGHBORS PREVAIL.

<TEXT>
<P>
For the drivers who pass by on Coast Highway daily, Smithcliffs is a mystery 
hidden behind bougainvillea, oleander and pine, marked only by a wrought-iron 
gate, a "private" sign and a driveway curving out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
To insiders and longtime locals, however, the bluff-top estate is known for two 
reasons: its colorful past and its eight-figure value as a 10.4-acre piece of 
the ever-shrinking, undeveloped oceanfront. 
</P>
<P>
But both the mystery and the seclusion of the site may soon be history. Because 
Smithcliffs has a new owner, construction magnate Gary Brinderson, with a new 
plan for the property: 26 custom homes. And the neighborhood is preparing to 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannette Merrilees, whose McKnight Drive home backs up to the estate, has a 
petition signed by 200 members of the community protesting the development. The 
26 homes, she contends, would be "built on five-foot pads to make the most of 
the views. Unfortunately, they will look down upon us from about 40 feet high. 
I can't imagine what it will do to our privacy or our property values." 
</P>
<P>
Brinderson would not be interviewed, but company spokesman Steven Fink said: 
"Mr. Brinderson and all of his projects are known for the quality of the 
buildings themselves. Everything he does speaks of the highest quality. The 
Brinderson Towers are the most obvious symbols of the type of work Mr. 
Brinderson involves himself with." 
</P>
<P>
Brinderson Construction is currently building the 14-story Brinderson Towers on 
MacArthur Boulevard in Irvine. The 
</P>
<P>
company also builds U.S. naval shipyards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The battle over the fate of Smithcliffs has another twist. 
</P>
<P>
Like exclusive Emerald Bay, next to and upcoast of Smithcliffs, while nearly 
surrounded by the city of Laguna Beach, it is not in the city. Under an old 
arrangement, it is actually in county territory. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach planners, however, claim that that is a distinction on paper only. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our position that his property should be annexed (to Laguna Beach) and 
dealt with as part of the city," said Kyle Butterwick, the city's planning 
director. "The city will certainly be the recipient of the impacts of his 
development." 
</P>
<P>
And Laguna Beach has made it clear that the project as it stands is unwelcome. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had written correspondence with Mr. Brinderson expressing our concerns 
about the project," Butterwick said. Those concerns, he said, include traffic, 
lack of public access to the beach and a substantial elimination of mature 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not the most sensitive site plan they could have submitted," Butterwick 
said. But Brinderson has submitted that plan to the county -- not Laguna -- and 
doesn't intend to seek the city's blessing, Fink said. 
</P>
<P>
"The property in question is in the county, not in the city of Laguna Beach," 
Fink said. Brinderson "enjoys being in the county. He very much wants to stay 
in the county. Whatever services are needed will be handled outside the city of 
Laguna Beach. And he doesn't feel any reason to be concerned by these actions." 
</P>
<P>
When he bought this 10.4-acre estate for a reported $15 million five years ago, 
however, Brinderson bought a piece of Laguna legend. Named Smithcliffs by Los 
Angeles oil man Lon Smith, one of its previous owners, the gray stucco mansion 
nestled next to gated Emerald Bay has a history of intrigue attributed most 
directly to another owner, the cigar-smoking Florence Lowe (Pancho) Barnes. 
Barnes, a member of a wealthy Pasadena family, was a lover of planes, and her 
exploits as an aviator and hostess of raucous parties on the property are 
legendary among those who remember Laguna Beach in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
"Pancho Barnes was a party lover and brought a crowd of Hollywood types down 
here to her parties," said Louise Turner, a realtor in Laguna Beach since 1957 
and a resident of Laguna Beach since 1933. "She had a swimming pool on the 
property with portholes in it so those in the bar in the basement of the house 
could watch the people in the pool. She also had a runway on the property for 
the aviators, one of whom unhappily was unable to stop his plane and went over 
the cliff." 
</P>
<P>
Barnes eventually moved to the Mojave Desert, where she owned a bar and motel 
later portrayed in the movie "The Right Stuff." And Smithcliffs fell into 
disrepair until Smith bought the property as a beach retreat from his Los 
Angeles home. Since Smith and his wife died, the property has remained vacant 
except for a trailer Brinderson put there. 
</P>
<P>
What will become of the estate now remains in question. 
</P>
<P>
Until last week, it was generally thought that the city of Laguna Beach had the 
upper hand because of Brinderson's need for sewer service. City officials 
figured that he eventually would have to ask them for it. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, however, Brinderson found an ally: the powerful board of directors 
of the Irvine Ranch Water District. The board voted unanimously to provide a 
sewer connection to Smithcliffs for future homes. Although the district's 
territory extends only as far as nearby Irvine Cove and is not contiguous with 
Smithcliffs, it could provide sewer service through its membership in the Aliso 
Water Management Agency, which owns the sewer lines along Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
It was a move that infuriated Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. Frank. 
</P>
<P>
"We are vehemently opposed to that annexation," Frank said. "I can't imagine 
any justification that will enable LAFCO (the Local Agency Formation 
Commission, which rules on potential annexations) to allow it. We are very, 
very opposed to any attempt to provide sewer service to that piece of 
property." 
</P>
<P>
Peer Swan, the president of the Irvine water board, said the board simply is 
doing its job: providing service to a potential customer. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not land-use planners; we are a water and sewer district," Swan said. 
"And for us to even take on the role of a land-use planner would be 
inappropriate. That smacks more of Eastern Europe, the old Eastern Europe, than 
the United States. This district has a history of accommodating developers who, 
for reasons of proximity or cost of service, ask to become a part of the 
district." 
</P>
<P>
Frank said the city has gone out of its way to compromise with Brinderson on 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
"We've offered to work with Mr. Brinderson's people since Day One. And I have 
privately told at least two of his people that I see an alternative that would 
benefit our community and the Brinderson group," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
Merrilees, who appeared before the water board to protest its involvement, said 
she plans to continue monitoring the project and to present her petition to 
county planners. 
</P>
<P>
"Just about every developer with a project in north Laguna has extended us the 
courtesy of making a presentation to the North Laguna Community Assn.," she 
said. "Mr. Brinderson has never even contacted us. He is avoiding the process 
of extending consideration to his neighbors, the city of Laguna Beach. The 
reason is simple: We are tougher on development here."

SHOWERS, HAIL AND SNOW FALL ON COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Scattered rain, hail and snow peppered a wide area of the Southland on Monday 
afternoon as a slow-moving storm system moved through the region. 
</P>
<P>
The showers were steady and relatively light in Orange County, although several 
Irvine residents reported that hail pelted the city for about 30 minutes at 
about 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Malinee Churanakoses, 16, said she was hit by hail as she left a friend's house 
on Lindstrom Street. "It was thundering down rocks," said Churanakoses, who 
moved to Irvine with her parents four years ago. "It was very surprising. I 
thought I was back in Seattle." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the county, snow dusted the Santiago and Modjeska peaks in the 
Santa Ana Mountains. And a water spout -- which occurs when a tornado-like 
column of air passes over water -- was reported near Dana Point just before 
5:30 p.m. and dissipated about 10 minutes later, the National Weather Service 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Parts of the San Bernardino Mountains recorded up to 10 inches of snow in a 
matter of hours, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Light snow also fell in the Grapevine area on Interstate 5 and on California 14 
in the Antelope Valley and a dusting could be seen on the San Gabriel Mountains 
from the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to snow, the system dumped short-lived rain and hail showers over 
the Southern California foothills and valleys. Rain also was reported in 
downtown Los Angeles, Long Beach and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
While the length and severity of the rainfall varied, forecasters predicted as 
much as half an inch of rain in the heavier showers, along with the possibility 
of hail and gusty winds to 40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The weather created serious traffic problems in some areas. The Simi Valley 
Freeway was closed for more than three hours after a tractor trailer carrying 
tile overturned on wet pavement about 2:45 p.m. One person was injured. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic is just screwed up all over on every one of our freeways," said 
California Highway Patrol spokesman Jim Wills. "The accident rate is higher 
than normal." 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials canceled Monday night's malathion spraying over 47 square 
miles of the San Fernando Valley because of the rain. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials in Orange County expressed delight about the rainfall. 
Orange County Agriculture Commissioner James D. Harnett welcomed the showers, 
saying that the county's farmers "need every drop of rain they can get." 
</P>
<P>
"The rain may make it a nuisance for people who are harvesting their crops now 
but by and large the benefits of rain overshadow the negative points," Harnett 
said. "There is no substitute for good rain. It does things that imported water 
cannot do." 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologist Rick Dittmann of WeatherData Inc., however, said the showers 
would not significantly affect the prolonged drought being experienced in 
Southern California.

BOY AVIATOR'S FATHER COULD BE GROUNDED; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: GARY ALIENGENA MAY HAVE HIS PILOT'S LICENSE SUSPENDED FOR FOUR 
MONTHS BECAUSE OF THE CRASH THAT INTERRUPTED HIS SON'S FRIENDSHIP FLIGHT AROUND 
THE WORLD.

<P>
Gary Aliengena, father of boy aviator Tony Aliengena, faces a four-month 
suspension of his pilot's license as the result of a crash that occurred while 
he was at the controls during his son's round-the-world flight last year, 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration proposed the suspension in January after 
investigating events that preceded the July 1989 crash in Alaska, FAA 
spokeswoman Elly Brekke said. 
</P>
<P>
Brekke said she did not know the specific findings against Aliengena, but an 
FAA investigator said shortly after the crash that the San Juan Capistrano man 
had mistaken a 300-foot taxiway for a 2,700-foot runway and tried to take off 
from it. The investigator also said that Aliengena had loaded the Cessna 210 
Centurion with two more passengers than its six-person limit. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA will now hold informal discussions in Los Angeles with Aliengena, who 
has appealed the proposed suspension. After discussions with Aliengena, the FAA 
will make a final decision, spokesman Paul Steucke said. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA could have proposed a suspension of anywhere between 30 days and a 
year, Brekke said. 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena can make a final appeal to a National Transportation Safety judge. 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena described the FAA investigation as "standard operating procedure." 
</P>
<P>
"Every time any airplane taxies off a runway, there is an FAA investigation. 
It's kind of like an IRS audit," Aliengena said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
However, Aliengena would not comment on the proposed suspension. 
</P>
<P>
After the crash, Aliengena blamed the layout of the gravel runway and taxiway 
for the mishap. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred on the last leg of 11-year-old Tony Aliengena's seven-week, 
22,000-mile Friendship Flight. 
</P>
<P>
The eight people on board, including the rest of the Aliengena family and 
observers, had just completed a three-day fishing trip in the small Alaskan 
village of Golovin, a remote town on the western coast of the state. Gary 
Aliengena took control of the plane at Golovin to give his son a rest and had 
planned to head for Nome, which is 90 miles west. 
</P>
<P>
The single-engine Cessna crashed after a gust of wind lifted the plane off the 
taxiway, which the elder Aliengena was allegedly using as a runway.

NEW LOOK FOR PARK PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A landscape architect has been hired by disgruntled merchants to remove the 
grass in Horton Plaza Park and replace it with flowers and shrubs to discourage 
loitering by drug dealers and panhandlers. 
</P>
<P>
But before work can begin, the plans must be approved by the City Council, said 
Ed Foster, a member of the Horton Plaza Park committee. 
</P>
<P>
"The grass will be taken out and replaced with seasonal flowers, with hedges 
around the perimeter," Foster said. "We will suggest that plaques be put up to 
designate that the park, including the fountain, is a historical site." 
</P>
<P>
Foster said the estimated cost of the changes is $25,000, which will be covered 
by surrounding business owners and a vendor selected by the city to sell food 
and merchandise. If approved, renovations are expected to be completed in July, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The city wanted to improve access to the park, which has become dominated by 
street people, drug sellers and users, panhandlers, and people sleeping on the 
grass," said Daro Quiring, maintenance coordinator of Center City Assn. 
</P>
<P>
To prove their point, the Horton Plaza management last year installed a video 
camera for five days in a window of Robinson's, the only store with an entrance 
on Broadway. The tape was edited into a 13-minute video that showed drug deals 
being made, people putting beer in the fountain, fights, and men urinating in 
cups, said Ron Oliver, executive vice president of Central City Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time of the day you go to the park, you will see drug deals, and there is 
always someone with a bottle of booze," Oliver said. "It is against the law to 
drink in a public park. The homeless aren't the problem, although one may be 
the symptom of the other. Some homeless people are substance abusers." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to move these people out of the park and give it back to working 
people and to the city people who pay taxes," Foster said. "If we move them 
out, then they will be forced to go the centers that can provide help for their 
drug abuse." 
</P>
<P>
After merchants began complaining in 1988 that the problems were hurting their 
businesses, City Manager John Lockwood asked Quiring to establish a task force 
to seek ways to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Steps were taken to improve park conditions. Police patrols were added. 
Planters were removed because they were being used as urinals. Benches were 
removed, but will be returned after the renovations. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver said that, after the city removed the benches near the Robinson's 
entrance, pedestrian traffic increased 62% in two weeks. He said that people 
would sit on the benches and intimidate customers entering the store. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first redesign for the park. In 1984, while the shopping center 
was being built and the park was closed, a community participation process 
worked with landscape architect Lawrence Halprin. His design ideas -- including 
moving the fountain to the northwest corner of the park -- were rejected, and 
the city restored the park to its historical condition. The San Francisco 
architect said of the seven-month, $125,000 project: "It is stupid to spend all 
this money to patch up a pipsqueak of a park." 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, Quiring and representatives of Horton Plaza, the Park and 
Recreation Department, the San Diego Police Department and nearby businesses 
began meeting monthly, and they agreed about a month ago on redesigning the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage more people to use the park, the city plans to present art 
exhibitions, musical entertainment, and office luncheons, Quiring said. 
</P>
<P>
Although such activities may bring "desirable people to the park," Ron Buckley, 
a member of the city Historical Site Board, said he is unconvinced that the 
proposal is complete or effective by itself. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the same problems in parks across the nation," he said. "And you don't 
see them rushing to change their parks' designs to solve their problems. An 
increase of police presence and enforcement will solve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Foster, who is also marketing director of the U.S. Grant Hotel, said that, in 
the past two months, the hotel has lost $500,000 in contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"Our clients don't feel safe, especially walking at night and going to 
restaurants in the area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Scott, 40, said that she sleeps in the park because there are not enough 
shelters to house all the homeless people in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"This is home to a lot of people," she said. We lay out here and don't hassle 
anyone. We pick up our own trash. This is our home. If they remove the grass, 
they will leave us lying on the dirt."

PROFESSOR TO RESUME CLASS AFTER INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A UC Irvine social sciences professor is scheduled to resume teaching the same 
class that sparked a university inquiry into an exercise in which students 
invested in Swiss francs and gold futures. 
</P>
<P>
Alain Lewis, the instructor of a course called "Games as Models of Social 
Phenomena," was relieved of teaching the class for the rest of the current 
quarter after complaints were filed with campus officials. 
</P>
<P>
He is to start teaching it again next quarter, a campus official said. 
</P>
<P>
Some students and parents complained that Lewis stood to benefit from the 
investments. "As far as I know he's coming back unless the inquiry finds out 
something different," said Colleen Bentley-Adler, a university spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
She said the inquiry was being conducted by William Schonfeld, dean of the 
school of social sciences, and Ron Wilson, the university's ombudsman. 
</P>
<P>
Students said they had been asked to invest between $25 and $100. Bentley-Adler 
said more than $1,400 had been invested and that students would receive their 
money back. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are any profits, they will go to to the students," she added. 
</P>
<P>
She said that Lewis is continuing to teach graduate courses. DANICA KIRKA

EXPANDED DISASTER PLAN IN THE WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Newport Beach is considering an expanded disaster plan that could add up to 
three new employees to the payroll, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which is a supplement to the city's current disaster plan, is 
being revised as it makes its way through each city department but should 
solidify by the time budget hearings begin April 9, executive assistant Ken 
Delino said. By July 1, an updated Emergency Operations Plan should be in 
place, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a residents' advisory panel gave recommendations on how to prepare 
Newport Beach residents and government for a regional disaster, such as an 
earthquake or major flood. 
</P>
<P>
While the report calls Newport Beach "excellently prepared" to deal with local 
emergencies, it says the city should improve plans for areawide catastrophes. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have a singular disaster, we know we can count on aid from Costa Mesa, 
Huntington Beach and the rest of Orange County, for that matter," Fire Capt. 
Ray Pendleton said. "On the other hand, if we have a situation that's an 
areawide disaster, then the boundaries between communities all of a sudden 
become walls again. No longer can you expect someone who has problems to assist 
you with your problems." 
</P>
<P>
The committee suggested that the Parks, Beaches and Recreation Department 
stockpile food, bedding and first aid for emergency shelters by July. The 
department should designate the location of potential shelters and employees 
should learn "shelter management" and advanced first aid, the report 
recommends. 
</P>
<P>
All departments should have an "emergency coordinator" and enough food and 
water to supply city employees and volunteers for three days, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Budget constraints may dictate the level of preparedness, officials say. For 
example, the first-year cost of adding three city employees, including the 
recommended full-time emergency services coordinator, and related equipment 
such as a car and computer, would cost $213,000, Pendleton said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also suggested that the city take steps to make residents more 
self-sufficient by organizing neighborhood self-help groups and encouraging 
communities to develop their own disaster plans. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of a major disaster, Pendleton said, calling 911 is "no longer a 
viable option." LESLIE EARNEST

RESIDENTS CAN LUMP ALL TRASH TOGETHER

<TEXT>
<P>
A program that will allow glass, plastic, newspapers and aluminum to be 
recycled without being pre-sorted by residents was unanimously approved Monday 
by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the council began discussing whether to charge Newport Beach 
residents 74 cents a month to pay for the recycling service, which is scheduled 
to begin in August. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the procedure, which allows unsorted trash to be left at 
curbside as usual, will ensure 100% participation and will cost Newport Beach 
half as much as the more common programs that require residents to separate 
recyclable materials before they are picked up. 
</P>
<P>
The "central processing recovery" plan is viable in Newport Beach because it is 
the only Orange County city with its own fleet of trash trucks, general 
services director David E. Niederhaus said. As a result of agreeing to the 
10-year contract with CR Transfer Inc., city trucks will simply begin 
delivering trash to the Stanton processing center instead of to the newly 
opened Bee Canyon landfill in southeast Irvine, which is almost 10 miles 
farther away. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is expected to make a final decision in six weeks on whether 
to recover costs by adding a 74-cent-per month fee to residents' water bills. 
Newport Beach has been recycling newspapers since 1974. Last November, a state 
law was passed that requires cities to recycle 25% of all their trash by 1995.

PANEL TO STUDY PLANS FOR REDEVELOPMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council unanimously voted Monday night to send redevelopment plans for 
six parcels to the Planning Commission for review. 
</P>
<P>
With the vote, the project overcame another hurdle, said May Hui, acting 
director of developmental services. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council originally established a survey area of six parcels in 
October. The parcels, which total 200 acres, include the Buena Park 
Mall/Handyman site on La Palma Avenue, Orange County Flood Control near Malvern 
Boulevard and Dale Street; the Builder's Square site near Beach Boulevard and 
Malvern Boulevard; the Buena Park Drive-In and strawberry fields near Holder 
Street and Lincoln Avenue; the southeast corner of Valley View Street and 
Orangethorpe Avenue, and the northwest corner of Crescent and Western avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is not known which sites eventually will be included in the final 
project, the main goal of the plan is to add improvements and intensify 
development at the various sites, Hui said. Some of the items being considered 
include adding room for more shop space at established commercial properties 
such as the Buena Park Mall and the Handyman site, as well as putting in homes 
in residentially zoned areas such as the strawberry fields. 
</P>
<P>
A final decision is not expected for some time, Hui said. "We don't know what 
is eventually going to happen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A series of public hearings is tentatively scheduled for June. The proposal 
then goes to the council for a final decision. LYNDA NATALI

BLIND PLAYERS SWEEP 'BEEPBALL' TOURNEY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A smile spread across Mari Sanchez's face after she smacked the beeping 
baseball and dashed to first base. 
</P>
<P>
She made it but was called out when outfielder David Myhren picked up the ball 
before it got past him, and raised it over his head. 
</P>
<P>
Though she hit the ball hard and straight, Sanchez, 15, never saw it. Neither 
did Myhren, 20. 
</P>
<P>
They are both blind. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez and Myhren, both from the Braille Institute Orange County Center in 
Anaheim, were playing in a weekend "beepball" tournament in Montebello that 
included both blind teams and sighted teams wearing blindfolds. Beepball is a 
modified version of baseball in which the blind play by using their sense of 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
Students from Braille centers across the state took part in the tourney, and 
blind teams won every game against the blindfolded by at least eight points. 
</P>
<P>
"We were slaughtered," said police union president David Rodriguez, after his 
team lost 48 to 14 to a Braille center squad, "but it was fun." 
</P>
<P>
Beepballs, which are a little larger than softballs, are equipped with special 
beepers, as are the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Batters listen for the beeping sounds to locate the ball, which is placed on a 
batting tee for them. Seven blind outfielders listen for the ball as it rolls 
their way, and batters are called out when an outfielder grabs the ball and 
holds it over his or her head. 
</P>
<P>
The blind batter runs to one of three beeping bases determined by the umpire. 
Rarely do the blind batters fail to locate the base, but the same could not be 
said about their blindfolded opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have high hopes of winning," said association member Joe Herrera, who 
wandered toward a beeping base that he never found. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the blind youngsters chalked up impressive statistics that would 
make a sighted baseball player envious. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, who stands just 5 feet tall, scored five runs in leading her team to 
28 to 16 win. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I were on their team," said Myhren of Sanchez's team. "They've got the 
good hitters."LEON TEEBOOM

CLASSMATES CHEER VICTORS OF ACADEMIC DECATHLON

Laguna Hills High School juniors Jay Kim and Ryan Sakamoto were treated like 
conquering heroes as they strode into their sixth-period class Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, can you come look at my notes?" yelled one female classmate amid a round 
of applause and cheers for the two friends as they appeared in the doorway. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrity status. Instant fame. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the attention bestowed upon the nine-member Laguna Hills Academic 
Decathlon team that beat out 46 other high schools in Saturday's California 
Academic Decathlon for the right to be called the smartest group of teen-agers 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Announcements that the team was the best in the state were made over a 
loudspeaker, flowers and cards were sent from boosters, and a special assembly 
was planned for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been like this all day," said team captain Jeff McCombs, an 18-year-old 
senior who has been a member of the Academic Decathlon team since he was a 
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
"We walked into class and everyone clapped," McCombs said. 
</P>
<P>
All but one member of the team, made up of juniors and seniors, attended school 
on Monday. They all had the same story to tell. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a congratulations card from a girlfriend," said 17-year-old senior Jeff 
DeWit, who said that his calculus class threw the team an early-morning bash. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's come-from-behind win was particularly sweet for the Laguna Hills 
team because it were considered an underdog to the El Camino High School team 
from Woodland Hills in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
But drawing on their knowledge of American Indians, the Laguna Hills teammates, 
representing all of Orange County, pulled ahead and garnered 45,361 points, 
compared to El Camino's 44,829. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still in the glow," said Principal Wayne Mickaelian on Monday as he 
fielded phone calls and accepted handshakes from faculty members who passed his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Students and teachers shared Mickaelian's upbeat mood. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great. It's well deserved," 15-year-old Michelle Moore said as 
she walked through the center of the campus. "They worked really hard for 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Art teacher Dalynn Malek agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole year has been a nice year, both in academics and in sports," Malek 
said, adding that the school recently won a California Intercollegiate 
Federation title in soccer. 
</P>
<P>
"The overall school spirit is at an all-time high," Malek said. "This is the 
frosting on the cake," 
</P>
<P>
With the state title in hand, the nine juniors and seniors have earned a shot 
at competing with the best academic decathlon teams in the nation. That contest 
will be held April 20 to 22 in Des Moines, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
But next week, the team is going to have to buckle down to its normal 
backbreaking schedule in preparation for the national event, said coaches Kathy 
Lane and Roger Gunderson. 
</P>
<P>
Since September, Lane said, the team has put in hundreds of hours of study 
time, meeting almost every day after school and on most weekends. To do well in 
the national, the group will have to continue that pace. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are phenomenal," Gunderson said. "We really believe in them. We 
really believe they can win. They certainly have what they need to do the job." 
</P>
<P>
To get the job done, Lane and Gunderson said, they will begin training for Des 
Moines by having team members bone up on subjects in which they are weakest, 
such as fine arts and literature. 
</P>
<P>
"They come up with some pretty obscure quotes from people you wouldn't normally 
know about," agreed team member Michael Lee, a 17-year-old senior. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the team are Jack Dietz, Julian Kingston and Bill Fischer, all 
17-year-old seniors; and Todd Faurot, 16, a junior. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Mickaelian said that much of the cost of the airfare and lodging for 
the students will be paid out of a $5,000 grant the team earned on Saturday in 
the state contest.

PEOPLE: ASPIRING STAR ISN'T TOYING WITH ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some days, Tanya Newbould must contemplate who she is. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, she just returned from a toy show in New York where she took on 
the role of Barbie, the doll. 
</P>
<P>
Other times she is known as Miss Hollywood USA, Miss Newport Beach and, most 
recently, as Miss Prettiest Eyes. 
</P>
<P>
And at times the Corona del Mar woman becomes a Marilyn Monroe impersonator. 
</P>
<P>
"In my career I have to be versatile with all these roles, but I'm keeping a 
close association with myself," said the aspiring actress, a Cal State Long 
Beach student in speech communications. "I'm looking for stardom." 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, said Newbould, 24: "I have to know who I am and what direction I'm 
heading. And I have to know my capabilities. I know I'm not the most beautiful 
woman out there." 
</P>
<P>
Newbould, a tall (5-foot-9) striking blonde, feels her greatest lesson was in 
last year's Miss California contest. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even make the top 15," she said. "Before the contest they told all of 
us to be ourselves, but I was trying to be more than that." 
</P>
<P>
She used that lesson to help her be named Barbie, Mattel Toy Co.'s famous doll. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really surprised when I was named Barbie over 25 others," she said. "I 
learned from past experiences not to get my hopes up." 
</P>
<P>
It was like a dream come true, said Newbould, who looks remarkably like the 
Barbie doll. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbie has always been my idol and I feel every little girl feels that way," 
she said. "This is a positive relationship." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Newbould feels she has been living the life style of Barbie 
through the advertisements and commercials in television and magazines. At 
times she is Dance Magic Barbie, Home Pretty Barbie and soon, Rock Star Barbie, 
the different characters of the doll. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbie is a friendly, outgoing personality that likes to dress up and go 
places and do things," she said, "and that's a lot like my own personality." 
</P>
<P>
Besides playing Barbie to market the doll, Newbould will soon visit sick 
children as Barbie in Los Angeles and Orange County hospitals. The one-time 
nursing student said: "I am my own marketing tool, which means I have to be 
very disciplined. If I'm not eating right, getting enough rest and not in good 
shape, I'm losing money. To me, this is all a business venture." 
</P>
<P>
Reaching stardom is a slow process that means a frenzied and difficult life 
style, said Newbould, who has been a model and actress for five years and has 
appeared in one television movie and several TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the most insane schedule," she said, "but I'm happy doing what I'm 
doing and I'm learning all the time. I've already experienced enough in five 
years than most people have in their entire life." 
</P>
<P>
And during that time, Newbould said, she has not had negative experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very businesslike when I do my work. I don't give anyone a false 
impression." 
</P>
<P>
And someday, "I'll get married and have children. But first I want to be a 
star." 
</P>
<P>
Veteran pool shooter Robin Bell, 32, of Costa Mesa just returned from Burgheim, 
Germany, after winning the first World Women's Pocket Billiards Championship 
over 15 other women and pocketing $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, a mother of two, said she is currently ranked No. 2 by the American 
Women's Billiards Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But the left-handed shooting pool player said she scored a first. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the first time the world championship has ever been held," she said, 
"so I guess that makes me No. 1 in the world." 
</P>
<P>
She calls herself a homemaker. "I have a pool table at home where I practice," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
More unusual names have been sent to the People Column, including this one from 
Linda Moak of Cypress: "My father is a mechanic and works on the car of a 
physician in Tulsa whose name is Dr. Safety First." 
</P>
<P>
And Noel White, of Fullerton, wrote this: "My name is Noel and I have a twin 
brother (named) Leon. He's backwards because he was the second born."

FAMILY AND FRIENDS SAY FINAL GOODBY TO MURDERED 3-YEAR-OLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 40 friends and family members gathered under cold, blustery skies in this 
Riverside County community Monday to say goodby to Marcelline Onick, a 
3-year-old Fullerton girl who was stabbed to death in her home. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief, closed-casket memorial service at the Evans-Brown Mortuary, 
mourners journeyed to Perris Valley Cemetery on the outskirts of town and 
gathered around her grave site as the Rev. Robert Town of Jacob's Well 
Christian Centre in Fullerton offered final words. The girl was buried with her 
favorite white unicorn toy and a red rose. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to understand that Marcelline is still alive. Marcelline is in the 
arms of Jesus," Town said. "We are here to commit the body of this dear child, 
(and) it is a tragedy. But this child will be with Christ for millions and 
millions and millions of years." 
</P>
<P>
As Town spoke from a wooden lectern, Joanne Boydston, mother of Marcelline, and 
Christopher Onick, the child's father, huddled on a bench facing the 
flower-laden white casket. Boydston cried softly while her estranged husband 
stared at the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The words did little to console family and friends who just nine days earlier 
had endured the shock of learning that Marcelline -- known affectionately as 
"Pooh Bear" -- was dead from multiple stab wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Robert Pacewitz, 21, an unemployed painter from Fullerton, said in a 
jailhouse interview last week that he killed Marcelline while baby-sitting her 
and Boydston's infant son. He also said he stabbed and slightly wounded his 
mother and her boyfriend in an Anaheim apartment the night before. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pacewitz's name was not mentioned during the funeral service, a 
current of anger over the slaying surfaced a couple of times. Onick punched a 
wall in anger after viewing the body of his daughter. The casket's lid had been 
raised briefly for those wishing a final look. 
</P>
<P>
And, at the grave site, Marcelline's godmother, Viola Bowie, lost her temper 
after being asked a question about Pacewitz. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hurting with anger, but I'm leaving him in God's hands," said Bowie, of 
Lawndale. "God is going to get his tail! We cannot punish him like God will." 
</P>
<P>
Drawing a deep breath, Bowie added: "Marcelline was a living angel. Lucifer 
himself must have crawled out of hell and gone into that girl's apartment that 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz, in Orange County Jail pending arraignment Thursday on charges of 
murder and attempted murder, said that he killed Marcelline and stabbed his 
mother and her boyfriend because the devil wanted him to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court records obtained Monday show that he was on 
probation at the time of the murder for a misdemeanor charge of possession of 
stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral-goers tried not to dwell on the tragedy of Marcelline's death, and 
instead recalled her as a fun-loving, happy little girl. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a doll," Steven Campos, a family friend and fellow church member, said 
in a eulogy. "She was always really hyper. She'd be jumping on the couch, and 
she'd want to play hide-and-seek." 
</P>
<P>
Campos, 23, drew laughter when he added jokingly: "She's giving God a hard time 
up there."

CRITIC AT LARGE: HOLLYWOOD'S NEW TEMPLE OF FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was absolutely in keeping with the roaring confidence of the Southern 
California '20s that Beverly Hills chose to build its mundane civic waterworks 
in the form of an Italian church, with a splendid bell tower that suggested the 
structure at La Cienega and Olympic boulevards was Our Lady of the Waters, or 
possibly of Thirst. 
</P>
<P>
The waterworks, built in 1928, was damaged by the 1971 earthquake but stayed in 
use until 1976, when Beverly Hills started buying its water from the 
Metropolitan Water District. The building, empty and subject to vandalism, 
became an item of dispute between preservationists, anxious to save a unique 
landmark, and locals who wanted it torn down to expand La Cienega Park, in 
which it sits. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was casting about 
for a new home for its sorely overcrowded library. Its massive holdings fill 
not only the library itself on Wilshire Boulevard but space in three nearby 
warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study showed that the waterworks could be brought up to 
earthquake-proof standards. The building could acquire a new wing that would 
echo the Italianate design and preserve the waterworks' landmark status. The 
academy negotiated a 55-year lease with the City of Beverly Hills, earmarked $5 
million for the renovation and expansion to the designs of architect Frances 
Offenhauser, and hopes to move in sometime this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The new building will have between three and four times the capacity of the 
old. "We calculated the volume by which our holdings are increasing annually," 
says Bruce Davis, executive director of the academy, "and we project we're OK 
well into the next century." 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the money the academy earns every year by televising its Academy 
Awards presentation goes to support the library and its staff of 32 headed by 
Linda Harris Mehr. The library was founded in 1931 and named for Margaret 
Herrick, its longtime librarian (who by academy legend said the award statuette 
looked like her Uncle Oscar, and thus gave his name, and its, to history). 
</P>
<P>
The other morning, Karl Malden, current president of the academy; Davis; film 
executive Robert Rehme, who heads the Academy Foundation, which sees to its 
finances, and John Pavlik, who is heading up a fund-drive in behalf of the 
library, gave a hard-hat tour of the construction. 
</P>
<P>
The library's collection of 12,000 films will now be housed in great concrete 
vaults through which the water was once filtered. On the second level, amid the 
rude concrete, the dust and the scaffolding, it is possible to see what a 
sunlit pleasure the main reading room will be, with both clerestory windows 
above and large wall windows that will have window seats before them. 
</P>
<P>
A parking structure is under construction and, to preserve the amenities of La 
Cienega Park, it will be roofed with tennis courts. By present plan, Malden 
says, a pedestrian overpass will link the park with the ball diamonds across La 
Cienega. 
</P>
<P>
Before the site tour, Mehr gave visitors a glimpse of the library's riches, 
which, to anyone seriously (or only casually) interested in the history of the 
American cinema, are very rich indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Herrick's first goal for the library was to acquire every book in 
English on the movies. The total is now 18,000 and it grows by roughly 600 to 
800 titles a year, the majority of which have made use one way or another of 
the library's resources. 
</P>
<P>
Those include files of clippings on 73,000 individuals -- actors, producers, 
directors, writers, technicians, even the odd critic is included. There are 
clippings, and often stills and production notes, on more than 82,000 films. 
There are 5 million -- count 'em, 5 million -- still photographs. The library 
has 5,000 scripts, including such illuminating items as Fred Zinnemann's own 
heavily annotated script for "High Noon," with "CLOCK" penciled in in capitals 
where he wanted those suspense-building inserts of the approach to noon. 
</P>
<P>
There are such oddments as a piece of Columbia Pictures stationery on which 
Rita Hayworth imprinted her lips and added an autograph. There is a copy of 
Eadweard Muybridge's historic 1881 book of photographs, "Attitudes of Animals 
in Motion." Conceived to settle a bet with Leland Stanford as to whether all 
four of a running horse's feet are off the ground at the same time, the 
succession of stills are in a sense a motion picture (and showed all four feet 
off the ground). The book is autographed by Muybridge. 
</P>
<P>
For those who would explore the earliest days of the movies, the library has 
the earliest trade paper, Views and Film Index, from 1906, as well as the other 
pioneer trades: Motion Picture Herald, Motion Picture Story Magazine and 
Photoplay, which began in 1915. The library subscribes to 200 publications and 
clips 75 of them. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the library has acquired some invaluable collections: the 
papers of John Huston, George Stevens, Alfred Hitchcock among others. There are 
some of the storyboard sketches by which Hitchcock planned his films in such 
detail. The collection also includes the tapes of the long interview Hitchcock 
did with Francois Truffaut. The papers of Stevens, who began as a 
cinematographer, contain some Laurel and Hardy scripts as well as Stevens' 
working script for "Gunga Din." There are as well the papers of George Cukor 
and Sam Peckinpah, Colleen Moore and Richard Barthelmess, Hedda and Louella and 
Sidney Skolsky. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the library acquired the files of the late Marty Weiser, a veteran 
Warner Bros. publicist whose imaginative publicity stunts, in an era when they 
could be very ingenious indeed, gave him legendary status among his peers. One 
fascinating item the cataloguers have already unearthed: a memo to Weiser in 
Hollywood from his boss in New York, Charles Einfeld, ordering Weiser to give 
Humphrey Bogart the star-making treatment and telling Weiser how to go about 
it. (Play down the gangster-role image for a start. "Sell Bogart romantically," 
said Einfeld's memo. Flood the papers with stills, he added.) 
</P>
<P>
About 14,000 researchers come to use the library each year. (None of the 
materials leave the library and security is tight.) In addition, the library's 
researchers answer nearly 30,000 telephone inquiries a year, taking calls every 
weekday but Wednesday. ("Thursday afternoon is heaviest; we've never been sure 
quite why," Mehr says.) 
</P>
<P>
To give the library a permanent endowment, freeing it from a year-to-year 
dependence on the television revenues, the academy has launched a $15-million 
fund drive. The first major gifts from the studios and production companies are 
in, to a total of $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The industry as such was notoriously casual about its own history, reflecting 
what was thought to be the swift commercial perishability of the product. The 
resulting loss is so many silent films -- and of so many early talking films, 
not to mention the fading of even fairly recent color films -- is mournful, 
bordering on the tragic. 
</P>
<P>
But the academy took the lead, early on, in looking to preserve the documentary 
history of an art form that was then hardly three decades old. Now it has been 
given some of the studios' own archives to preserve (all of Paramount's still 
and press materials, for example). Under a special grant, the library is 
microfilming several thousand core files. It is also rewashing production 
stills to prevent fading and discoloring. 
</P>
<P>
The new library will be livelier than a church, real or fake, but it will not 
so inappropriately have something about it of a temple to honor film past, 
present and future.

PASADENA AIDS BENEFIT: A GALA DISASTER WITH GOOD INTENTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC/DANCE CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The major music and dance organizations of Los Angeles, like comparable 
organizations everywhere, have been severely threatened by the AIDS crisis. 
</P>
<P>
For some reason, however, our performing-arts institutions have done little to 
help counteract that devastating threat. The Philharmonic, the Music Center 
Opera, the Joffrey Ballet, all seem to have looked the other way, leaving 
crucial fund-raising chores to the show-biz community. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the myopic teams that manage our most glamorous music-makers and 
dancers are preoccupied with the challenge of filling their own precarious 
coffers. It is, they might rationalize, a matter of resident priorities. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, one wanted to applaud the so-called International Gala 
of Opera and Ballet ventured Sunday night at Pasadena Civic Auditorium by a 
committee called From the Heart. The beneficiary would be the AIDS Hospice 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The intentions were lofty. The concert, alas, teetered on the brink of artistic 
as well as financial disaster. Teetered is putting it kindly. 
</P>
<P>
The event, produced by Alan Sievewright of London, was hastily assembled, oddly 
conceived, badly publicized, strangely cast, shoddily executed. It promised far 
more stars than it was able to deliver. It played to a heavily papered, 
determinedly enthusiastic, hardly full house. 
</P>
<P>
The program was dominated by would-bes and has-beens. An air of desperate 
improvisation hovered about the pretentious proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
An on-stage parade of awkward hosts, led by Sievewright and the actress Jane 
Seymour, interpolated puff and self-congratulation as well as redundant 
annotation. Only one speaker, the actress Morgan Fairchild, actually mentioned 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
It was sad. It was embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it wasn't a total loss. Elizabeth Connell, the British soprano who saved 
a "Fidelio" in San Diego last year, sang Lady Macbeth's letter scene with 
sufficient sweep and passion to compensate for some smudged coloratura and a 
strained climax. Martina Arroyo, though past her prime at 54, sang arias from 
"Aida" and "Forza" with stylish authority. 
</P>
<P>
In matters terpsichorean, there was the passing distraction of a competent 
ballerina on leave from the Bolshoi. Alla Khaniashvili-Artyushkina, who happens 
to be spending the year in Southern California, knows the Petipa tradition, 
knows how to sell the fouette marathon of the Black Swan, knows how to minimize 
the liability of a cumbersome caractere partner as the prince -- her husband, 
Vitali Artyushkin. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Artyushkin could do much with the vapid platitudes of the 
Crassus-Aegina duet from "Spartacus." For that, however, one might blame the 
choreographer, Yuri Grigorovich. 
</P>
<P>
There was only one bona-fide superstar on the agenda: Maya Plisetskaya. Now 64, 
she traveled all the way from Madrid to approximate her 5-minute signature 
piece, "The Dying Swan," one more poetic time. The sinuous flutter of her 
apparently boneless arms continues to astound. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, this was one of those nights. Kathryn Grayson, erstwhile diva of the 
Silver Screen (introduced as Kathleen Grayson), stumbled over her introduction 
of a nondescript baritone named Damen Rhodes. A replacement for one Dean 
Peterson who was to have replaced Gino Quilico, Rhodes struck unintentionally 
funny Toreador poses on behalf of Bizet. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Sass, the Hungarian soprano who enjoyed brief renown in the mid-1970s 
before ruining a promising lyric instrument, came out of obscurity to yelp the 
final scene of Richard Strauss' "Salome." Her most notable achievement was to 
model a spangly bikini while ogling the severed head of John the Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
The "Salome" episode, not incidentally, was subjected to amateurish low-camp 
staging. It came complete with a minimally involved Herod and Herodias, an 
incipiently headless Prophet, and a big, attentive, silent chorus of beefcake 
extras. 
</P>
<P>
Although this was awful, worse was to come. The second half of the program 
opened with the first five minutes of the second act of Wagner's "Die Walkure." 
None less than David Hockney provided the scenery: bizarre, candy-striped 
mountains painted on flappy, ill-lit curtains. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Lebherz (who later returned to cackle Mephisto's serenade) blustered 
Wotan's invocation. A local soprano named Veronica Diamond, replacing Marita 
Napier who was to have replaced Rita Hunter, reduced Brunnhilde's battle cry to 
shrill caricature. 
</P>
<P>
When the formal part of the program drew to a merciful close -- just when the 
cognoscenti thought Plisetskaya's terminal fowl was about to die a second time 
-- the hosts cut off the ovation and returned for some clumsy valedictory 
speeches. These were followed by the ultimate anticlimax: a mass curtain call, 
adorned with balloons and accompanied, for reasons unfathomable, by "The Stars 
and Stripes Forever." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Fetta and the Pasadena Symphony had begun the festivities with a listless 
performance of the "Aida" overture that Verdi discarded. They ended the evening 
with misplaced Sousa pomp under dubious circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the "gala," the orchestra sounded under-rehearsed, and the notorious 
acoustics of the Civic Auditorium muffled just about everything and everyone. 
Sometimes one can be grateful for muffling.

ERASING BOUNDARIES AT THE FORUM;

<P>
POP: ERASURE IS THE FIRST POP ACT WITH AN AVOWEDLY GAY FRONT MAN TO SELL OUT 
THE FORUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Swooning, Andy Bell put the back of his hand to his forehead in mock distress. 
"Mother, I didn't mean to hurt you," the lead singer of Erasure soliloquized, 
not all that seriously, between songs Sunday at the Forum. "I'm sorry for 
coming out the way I did. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
As in from the closet, in case there was any doubt. 
</P>
<P>
The song being followed, "Hideaway," is an upbeat anthem recalling that "mother 
used to cry herself to sleep" -- but concluding with the inspirational kicker, 
"Don't be afraid, you don't have to hide anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Mom also figured into a subsequent song, "Que Sera Sera," to which Bell added a 
bit of a gender bend: "When I was just a little girl, I asked my mother, what 
would I be . . . a homo-sex-shual or a straight? This is what she said to me. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
And the sold-out crowd, dominated not by trendy West Hollywoodians but by very 
straight adolescent girls, roared approval at Bell's every ironically intoned 
line, not to mention his costume changes into several different sets of 
leg-baring leotards. 
</P>
<P>
Bell also drew near-Beatlesque cheers for his campy between-song bits and goofy 
dance steps and glittery headdress and Jerry Lewis-does-Judy rendition of "Over 
the Rainbow." At one point, singing the Erasure hit "Stop," he became Diana 
Ross to his two black female backup singers' Supremes for a few bars of "Stop 
in the Name of Love." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the boys in the audience shifted uneasily alongside their dates, 
wondering whether to ease over onto the side of tolerance -- and therefore feel 
comfortable dancing to the pulsing techno-pop beat -- or whether to just fidget 
in place. But those gals, they do love Andy. 
</P>
<P>
Every mother's nightmare, every teen-age girl's dream? 
</P>
<P>
Erasure is aptly named. What's being rubbed out is the line that represented a 
sexual barrier not to be crossed on the charts or in music fans' hearts. 
</P>
<P>
This English pair is the first pop attraction with an avowedly and demonstrably 
gay front man to sell out the Forum -- quite an accomplishment indeed, given 
the once-naughty nature of the act. In Sunday's show, the first of two there, 
Bell didn't hide from but rather played with the audience's suspicions and 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
If your criteria for good pop performances center around the danger factor, 
then Sunday's show was a good, provocative one. But by several other standards, 
it was closer to a snooze. 
</P>
<P>
It's a given that virtually all of Vince Clarke's keyboard and drum machine 
music will be pre-programmed, and those lone parts in each number that weren't 
might as well have been (no danger of improvisation here). 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that they have to somehow make up for this lack of on-stage players, 
Clarke and Bell have bought themselves a real show, but one that doesn't look 
thought through beyond the most elementary conceptual stage. 
</P>
<P>
The stage set is in a jungle motif, which seems to have been picked 
arbitrarily. Joining the duo, in addition to the two female singers, are two 
male dancers whose moves, unremarkably choreographed in part by Michael Clark, 
are barely in sync; it looks like someone free-form dancing in front of a 
mirror with a slight time delay. 
</P>
<P>
These distractions do serve their purpose -- to make us forget just how little 
"live" music is being performed. But it's like being distracted from a dull 
billboard by a bad freeway accident. 
</P>
<P>
That's tough, because Erasure's latest album, "Wild!," is very much the duo's 
best, with far richer musical textures and interesting themes that deserve more 
than the campy sideshow treatment seen Sunday. As a two-man outfit, Erasure may 
look malnourished alone on stage, but throwing money at the problem in the form 
of scenery and dancers is not going to help. 
</P>
<P>
Real ideas will.

A Los Angeles federal bankruptcy judge is expected to hear arguments today from 
attorneys for comedian Bill Cosby and his wife, Camille, on a motion to appoint 
a trustee to oversee $10 million in assets held by the Cosbys' ex-business 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
The Cosbys sued their longtime manager, Mary Waller, last fall for allegedly 
embezzling more than $8.5 million from the Cosbys during her eight-year tenure 
as chief financial officer of SAH Enterprises, the Cosbys' Santa Monica-based 
personal services corporation. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Waller filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code. The Cosbys then filed a motion with bankruptcy Judge Arthur 
Greenwald to declare Waller incompetent to manage her finances on grounds that 
she uses cocaine and that she misappropriated the Cosbys' money. 
</P>
<P>
Waller has denied using cocaine and maintains that all money, property and 
tangible goods she received from the Cosbys over the last decade were 
rightfully earned. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, it was nearly a year ago that Camille Cosby phoned 
ahead to ready the Cosbys' private airplane for a trip, only to discover that 
Waller had used it to fly to New York. 
</P>
<P>
It was that incident, according to documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court 
last week, that launched the Cosbys' investigation, suspension and -- as of 
last July -- dismissal of the 46-year-old Waller. 
</P>
<P>
"She commissioned the investigation of Waller because if Waller could do 
something as terrible (Ms. Cosby's description) as taking the airplane without 
Ms. Cosby's consent, she could only imagine what other terrible things Waller 
may have done," Waller's attorney, Richard Pachulski, said in court documents. 
</P>
<P>
He maintained that Waller, who was a close family friend as well as a trusted 
employee, was an unwitting victim, caught in the middle of an intrigue between 
a husband and wife who consistently kept secrets from each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, Ms. Cosby believed the airplane had been used by Waller for 
personal reasons when, in fact, the airplane had been used . . . to perform 
services for Mr. Cosby on a home that was to be a surprise for Ms. Cosby," 
Pachulski said. Waller couldn't defend herself "because Mr. Cosby had sworn her 
to secrecy regarding the house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, an investigation was launched, culminating in Waller's dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the past seven years, Waller engaged in a consistent pattern of 
conversion, misappropriation and embezzlement," Cosby attorney David Dykhouse 
wrote in his own summary of the case, filed in bankruptcy court three months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Cosbys traveled extensively, they maintained a "California Exchange 
Account" at Wells Fargo Bank and gave Waller check-signing authority, said 
Dykhouse. Over the last decade, the Cosbys contend in their lawsuit that Waller 
"spent approximately $5 million on her own personal affairs without (their) 
consent." 
</P>
<P>
All told, the Cosbys estimated her alleged misappropriation in cash and goods 
at more than $8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
In a declaration filed last Dec. 5, the 52-year-old star of NBC's "The Cosby 
Show" detailed a list of suspect canceled checks and petty cash receipts listed 
in Waller's books on the refurbishing of Camille's "surprise" brownstone at 18 
E. 71st St. in New York City's affluent upper eastside. 
</P>
<P>
According to Cosby, money earmarked for the brownstone went instead for such 
things as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Remodeling Waller's $3-million home at 620 Round Hill Road in Greenwich, 
Ct. ($61,280 paid to Archtype Studios); 
</P>
<P>
 -- Waller's cook ($385); 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tickets to a dinner/dance at the Greenwich Polo Club ($550) and a "gala 
benefit" for the Islamic Cultural Society, held at New York's Plaza Hotel 
($300); 
</P>
<P>
 -- An electric clothes rack for Waller's house ($1,129). 
</P>
<P>
Waller also spent $140,650 out of "petty cash" between February and November, 
1988, on business-related expenses, such as a $300 tip for the pilot of the 
Cosbys' airplane, according to Cosby's court statement. 
</P>
<P>
Non-business-related "petty cash" expenditures totaled $17,340.61, according to 
the declaration, and included payments to manicurists, dry cleaners, 
pharmacists and veterinarians along with purchases of lingerie, bird and dog 
toys, fish, and playthings for Waller's son, Emon. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to Waller's attorneys, at least a significant portion of those 
expenditures was part of her regular compensation as the Cosbys' financial 
manager, confidante and business partner. 
</P>
<P>
"As a consequence of the significant position that Waller held with the Cosbys 
. . . Waller received compensation levels, including bonus, of approximately $1 
million each year," Pachulski said. 
</P>
<P>
During a hearing last week before Judge Greenwald, the Cosbys' attorneys 
maintained that Waller's W-2 forms for the past two years showed that her 
annual salary was $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Pachulski, the Cosbys also paid many of Waller's personal 
expenses because she worked out of her homes in Connecticut and Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
"To further acknowledge the Cosbys' dependence on and satisfaction with 
Waller's service during the period of her employment," wrote Pachulski, the 
Cosbys: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Paid off Waller's $570,000 mortgage on her residence at 29441 Pacific Coast 
Highway in Malibu; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Guaranteed a $3.2-million unsecured line of credit for her with City 
National Bank; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loaned her $70,000 per month from December, 1988, through May, 1989, "with 
no evidencing promissory note or discussion of terms or interest rate on the 
loan," said Pachulski. Further, he said, Waller maintains that the monthly 
loans were part of her compensation, not money to be paid back. 
</P>
<P>
Waller also had to use her own money to help cover the Cosbys' lavish spending 
habits, "because the Cosbys were notorious for having their bank accounts 
overdrawn in as much as seven figure amounts," Pachulski wrote. 
</P>
<P>
In her own deposition, according to Pachulski, Camille Cosby admitted to having 
discovered an overdraw of $1.4 million at one time, but added that she was not 
aware that it had happened until after the fact. 
</P>
<P>
With regard to the Cosbys' charges that Waller uses cocaine, the former 
business manager has submitted to drug testing, but the findings have been 
disputed. 
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion that Waller is an abuser of cocaine is not far-fetched since 
most everyone who has had some contact with her describes her as a volatile, 
extremely emotional, overanxious, irritable and irrational person -- traits 
that are frequently applied to users of cocaine," the Cosbys' attorneys wrote 
in a request for Judge Greenwald to order chemical testing to see if Waller 
used drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In a sworn declaration, Laura Walker, the office manager for the Cosbys' law 
firm -- Patterson, Belknap, Webb and Tyler -- told of how she had come across a 
"white, powdery substance" secreted in an intricately folded piece of paper 
among the financial records that the law firm confiscated from Waller's home 
last fall. When Walker took it to the police to have it tested, she was told 
that a test could not be conducted without charges having been filed. The 
police then disposed of the substance, Walker testified. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Greenwald ordered Waller to submit hair and urine samples to 
the Cosbys' attorneys for drug testing, and to undergo a psychological 
evaluation to determine her competence in managing her financial affairs during 
her bankruptcy reorganization. She complied with the drug testing and the 
results were negative. 
</P>
<P>
But Cosby lawyer Eugene Galernter complained to Greenwald last Thursday that 
Waller had dyed and cut her hair shortly before providing the hair sample, 
possibly affecting the results. He asked that she be re-tested. Greenwald has 
not yet responded to that request. 
</P>
<P>
Galernter also said that Waller has lied on credit card applications about such 
basic personal information as her Social Security number, place of birth and 
age. 
</P>
<P>
Eli Chiu, the controller for SAH Enterprises, said in a sworn statement to the 
court that Waller was often angry, subject to wild mood swings and very 
difficult to work with. 
</P>
<P>
During last Thursday's hearing, Pachulski called the Cosbys' attempt to 
discredit Waller "a witch hunt" whose real intent was to keep Waller from 
revealing the Cosbys' "bizarre" financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, these people paid out millions of dollars without contracts," 
Pachulski said. "Many of (the transactions) Mr. Cosby kept secret from Mrs. 
Cosby for reasons unknown to me."

Marilyn Monroe's Estate: A judge in New York ruled that a fourth of the 
proceeds and royalties from Marilyn Monroe's estate, which still generates $1 
million a year, will go to a psychiatric center in England and not the widow of 
her acting coach, Lee Strasberg. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe willed 75% of the proceeds to Strasberg, and his wife, Anna Strasberg, 
was named administrator of the estate after he died. Monroe willed the rest to 
her psychiatrist, the late Dr. Marilyn Kris, who gave it to the center for the 
study of troubled children. Anna Strasberg contended that bequests were limited 
to Kris' lifetime but was overruled. BETH KLEID

GAY SOAP ON HIATUS AS CREATOR SEEKS 'DEAL' 
</P>

<P>
No future screenings are scheduled for "Secret Passions," the locally produced, 
gay-oriented soap opera that had its Orange County cable television debut on 
Cablevision of Orange over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Producer David Gadberry says he has completed episodes two and three but has no 
plans to submit them to Cablevision or to any other public access broadcaster, 
pending some sort of "deal" he declined to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
He had previously said he hopes that his show will be picked up for production 
by a commercial cable company. 
</P>
<P>
If the "deal" goes through, Gadberry said, the show, which has aired on 22 
public access stations nationwide and in Canada, will no longer be aired on 
public access. But if the deal falls through, he said, he will continue 
producing the soap and submitting episodes for public access broadcast every 
two weeks. He said he has received funding from local businesses and 
individuals, whom he did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
Gadberry says he has sent the pilot episode to nine public access outlets in 
Orange County and to two in Los Angeles, but he won't name them for fear they 
will be "bombarded" with calls. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's local debut broadcast drew two calls from people. Both admitted 
that they didn't see the show but only read about it, according to John 
Borgenson, a programmer for Cablevision of Orange programmer.

HANG THE CONSEQUENCES -- MUSEUM SHOWCASES ITS MISTAKES; 
</P>
<P>
FORGERIES: HOPING TO TURN LIABILITIES INTO ASSETS, THE BRITISH MUSEUM IS 
EXHIBITING FAKES THAT FOOLED ITS EXPERTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A spurious 6th-Century sarcophagus was exposed only after someone noticed that 
it depicted a female figure wearing 19th-Century underwear. 
</P>
<P>
And a bogus marble bust of Julius Caesar, long the most famous likeness of 
Caesar in Britain, turned out to have been "weathered" artificially, probably 
by someone pounding on it with a nail-studded piece of wood. 
</P>
<P>
These are just two examples of the many instances over the last 250 years in 
which experts at Britain's oldest and largest museum have been hoodwinked by 
fakes. Now, in an admirable display of institutional humility -- tempered with 
a well-honed sense of promotion -- trustees of the British Museum hope to turn 
their liabilities into assets. 
</P>
<P>
They have assembled what is reputed to be the most comprehensive exhibit ever 
of cultural fakery, and based it on their own mistakes. The exhibits range from 
3,500-year-old monastic forgeries to such products of the $100-billion market 
for modern commercial imitations as counterfeit Cartier and Rolex watches. 
</P>
<P>
"The lesson of this exhibition is that all museums, all collectors, if they 
collect aggressively and long enough, will eventually collect a fake," said 
Mark Jones, an assistant curator of coins and medals who spent three years 
organizing the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all emotionally involved with fakes," Sir David Wilson, the museum's 
director, said, but "nobody wishes to be associated with them." 
</P>
<P>
He said they represent the point where "we as experts have bumped up against 
our own fallibility," which may also be the reason the general public finds 
fakes so fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, "Fake? The Art of Deception," in a second-floor gallery of the 
museum, continues until Sept. 2. It deals not only with the frauds themselves 
but also with their authors and victims, the surprisingly varied motives behind 
them and techniques of both perpetration and detection. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out, for example, that for all his creativity, Michelangelo was not 
above a bit of fakery. He forged the work of his teacher, Domenico Ghirlandaio, 
as a student prank. And he sculpted a sleeping Cupid which he is said to have 
sold fraudulently as an antiquity. 
</P>
<P>
Among the victims of cultural fakery was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, enough the 
master of rational deduction to create the fictional sleuth Sherlock Holmes, 
but so taken in by some famous trick photographs that he became convinced of 
the existence of fairies. 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies one of the great lessons of the exhibit, organizer Jones pointed 
out. Even the most academically and intuitively gifted of individuals sometimes 
fall into the trap of believing what he wants to be true. 
</P>
<P>
"Present Piltdown Man (a hoax) to a paleontologist out of the blue and it will 
be rejected out of hand," Jones said. "Present it to a paleontologist whose 
predictions about the 'missing link' have been awaiting just such evidence and 
it will seem entirely credible. 
</P>
<P>
"Bring an exceptionally rare Athenian coin to a classical numismatist and he 
will examine it with careful skepticism. Allow one of the greatest of all 
classical numismatists, (the late) Sir George Hill, a director of the British 
Museum, to find such a coin for himself, mounted as a jewel around a lady's 
neck, and he will take its authenticity for granted." 
</P>
<P>
The Royal Scottish Museum once rejected an obvious hoax brought from Canada, a 
trout covered with white fur, allegedly grown as protection against cold water. 
But the story had got out, and public demand to see the furry fish was so great 
that the museum put the fake on display. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most prolific early fakers were priests and monks, who concocted 
documentary "evidence" to prove land claims. The oldest fake in the exhibit is 
a Babylonian inscription on a stone monument, purporting to date from about 
2300 BC but actually forged by monks around 1500 BC to establish the antiquity 
of the privileges and revenues of their temple. 
</P>
<P>
"It has recently been estimated that the great monastic houses of England were 
so busy forging writs in the century after the Norman Conquest (of 1066) that 
over half the surviving charters of Edward the Confessor may be spurious," 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
In World War II, Germany distributed forged British bank notes in the hope of 
crippling the British economy, and forged British newspaper articles on the 
state of the Royal Air Force in the hope of crippling British morale. 
</P>
<P>
Decades of Communist rule in the Soviet Union and East Europe created a vast 
collection of doctored photographs in which figures were either added or 
eliminated, depending on the goal of historical revisionism at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Most people who buy fake Chanel perfume or fraudulent Dior accessories know 
what they are getting but are "buying an illusion," Jones said, "the illusion 
of status, of belonging, of success, conferred by the fraudulent reproduction 
of a famous name." 
</P>
<P>
Once unmasked, forgeries in the world of art and antiquities are usually 
considered valueless or, worse, an embarrassment. But not always. Giovanni da 
Cavino of Padua and his son produced such masterful replicas of ancient coins 
in the 16th Century that some of their fakes are now worth as much as or more 
than the originals, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
The late Tom Keating is considered the most prolific and versatile art forger 
to be exposed in Britain in this century. He produced about 2,000 fakes of the 
work of more than 100 different artists, including Samuel Palmer. Exposed in 
1976, he became a popular hero who won a television award for a series of art 
lectures. A posthumous sale of his work realized about $400,000, several times 
the estimated value. 
</P>
<P>
The "Golden Age" of fakery was the 19th Century, Jones said. Collecting relics 
spread from a relative handful of aristocrats and scholars to broader social 
classes. And there was a large number of skilled craftsmen capable of producing 
relics on demand. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1930s, the craftsmen were mostly gone and "the great age of faking was 
over," Jones said. Improved methods of detecting fakes and harsher penalties 
for the fakers also helped. 
</P>
<P>
A quick stroll through Jerusalem's Old City, where vendors offer tourists phony 
antiquities including "Roman" coins, will make it clear that fakery is not 
dead. But generally, according to Jones, modern fakes lack the "exuberance and 
the quality of those made in the 19th Century." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, public institutions like the British Museum tend to be philosophical 
about their own collecting blunders, at least about the older ones, such as the 
spurious sarcophagus and the bogus bust of Caesar. "Nobody can be really 
embarrassed by something that happened more than a century ago," Jones said.

ART: CHRISTIE'S HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL GUARANTEE A PRICE FOR A COLLECTION, 
MATCHING THE PRACTICE OF SOTHEBY'S.

The latest multimillion-dollar artworks to join the parade in New York's spring 
auctions are five modern and Impressionist paintings from the collection of the 
late Robert Lehman. A Vincent van Gogh self-portrait valued at $20 million to 
$30 million will go on the block at Christie's on May 15, along with paintings 
by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Amedeo Modigliani and Kees 
van Dongen. Sales of the five works are expected to total between $40 million 
and $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
In a move designed to sharpen its competitive edge against Sotheby's and 
reassure shareholders, Christie's has announced that it will guarantee the 
Lehman sale for an undisclosed price. In the past, Sotheby's has guaranteed a 
minimum price to some consignors -- setting off a storm of controversy in the 
art world -- but Christie's has resisted this practice. 
</P>
<P>
A press release announcing the Lehman sale says that the firm has had a 
"long-standing concern about the possible negative impact of guaranteed sales 
on the art market." However, "in certain cases" Christie's has "found it 
difficult to compete without offering guarantees," the prepared statement says. 
"The firm recognizes the need to maintain its prime position in the 
international art market, and to maintain a flexible and competitive attitude 
to market pressures created by the use of the guarantee by other auction 
houses." 
</P>
<P>
The two London-based houses are arch competitors, but lately Sotheby's 
aggressive tactics have pushed it ahead of Christie's. Sotheby's 1989 sales 
worldwide totalled $2.9 billion, while Christie's racked up about $2.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Lehman auction features works from the collection of a New York financier 
who was a major donor to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Van Gogh 
self-portrait was painted in Arles, France, in early December, 1888, a year and 
a half before the Dutch master's death. The 18x15-inch painting, executed in 
Van Gogh's vigorous, mature style, is among the few works that the artist 
signed, according to the Park Avenue auction house. 
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh painted himself in a yellow jacket against a bright green background 
and dedicated the work to Charles Laval, an artist friend who had given him a 
self-portrait. Van Gogh's self-portrait was shown in "Van Gogh in Arles," a 
1984 blockbuster exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and it will be 
reproduced on the cover of a book on Van Gogh's self-portraits to be published 
by the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh in Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
Other paintings from the Lehman collection to be offered on May 15 are "Girl 
With Fur," an 1891 oil by Toulouse-Lautrec ($10 million to $15 million); 
Renoir's 1885 "Nude Seated" ($6 million to $8 million); Modigliani's 1917 
portrait of his mistress, Jeanne Hebuterne ($4 million to $6 million); and Van 
Dongen's "Young Lady Rider" ($700,000 to $1 million). 
</P>
<P>
While the Van Gogh self-portrait is likely to be the star of the Lehman sale, 
it is expected to be upstaged by another Van Gogh, "Portrait of Dr. Gachet," 
also offered on May 15 at Christie's. The 1890 portrait of Paul-Ferdinand 
Gachet, who treated Van Gogh in Auvers, is valued at $40 million to $50 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The auction record for a Van Gogh is $53.9 million, paid in 1987 for "Irises" 
by Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond. In that controversial and highly 
publicized sale, Bond borrowed half the purchase price from Sotheby's. His 
business fortunes subsequently took a plunge, forcing Bond to sell other works 
from his collection and consider unloading "Irises," the world's most expensive 
artwork.

Men and women studying to be priests or nuns should not be allowed to take 
their final vows if they cannot control their sexual urges, the Vatican said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who do not seem to be able to overcome their homosexual tendencies or 
who maintain that it is possible to adopt a third way, living in an ambiguous 
state between celibacy and marriage must be dismissed from the religious life," 
it said. 
</P>
<P>
The instruction was contained in a 70-page document written by the Vatican 
department in charge of religious life and approved by Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Jerome Hamer, the department's head, evaded questions at a news 
conference on how widespread the problem of homosexuality was. "The problem is 
very clear. (Members of religious orders) are men and women who take a vow of 
chastity. We cannot accept that those entering the religious life are not able 
to respect this vow," he said.

In an encouraging sign for U.S. trade, Japan's trade surplus fell for the 10th 
straight month in February by 31% from a year ago, the Finance Ministry said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The February decline to $5 billion followed a dramatic 90% fall in January's 
surplus, the biggest year-over-year drop in more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
February exports shrank by 1.9% to $21.96 billion, the fifth consecutive 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
Imports were pushed up by higher oil prices and rose 11.9% to $16.95 billion -- 
the lowest percentage gain in five months. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's exports dropped back because of sluggish U.S. demand and growing 
production of Japanese goods at U.S.-based factories. Exports to the United 
States fell 5.9% to $7.12 billion.

President Bush acknowledged a traditional conflict between his office and the 
Federal Reserve Board today but denied a report that he did not plan to 
reappoint Alan Greenspan as the board's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no discussion of that nature at all," Bush told a news conference 
when asked about a report in the Los Angeles Times last week that he would not 
reappoint Greenspan due to the chairman's refusal to lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's four-year term expires next year. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said, "Now, the question: Am I happy with interest rates? Look, every 
President would like to see interest rates lower. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't knock the concern some have over inflation. . . . But there's no 
bubbling war with Alan Greenspan."

AUTO SLUMP BLAMED FOR RETAIL SALES DROP 
</P>

<P>
Another month of sluggish automotive sales caused retail sales to fall by 0.9% 
in February to $146.5 billion, the Commerce Department reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The decline was the biggest since a drop of 1.3% in October. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts were pleased by the report, but Irwin Kellner, chief economist 
for Manufacturers Hanover in New York, said the 0.9% decline "shows an 
underlying weakness in the economy that should not be ignored." 
</P>
<P>
If the 6% drop in automotive sales -- the biggest since a 26.5% plunge in 
January, 1987 -- was not figured in, total sales of all other goods to 
consumers would have increased by only 0.5% in February, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sign that we are teetering on the edge of a recession," Kellner said. 
"What makes it even more alarming are the markets have talked about the need 
for higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"This report suggests the recipe for continued economic growth is lower 
interest rates." 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust in Chicago, was much 
more optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a strong report," Dederick said. "There doesn't seem to be any sign that 
the consumer believes there is going to be a recession, and consequently that 
reduces the risks there will be a recession." 
</P>
<P>
Added forecaster William MacReynolds of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce: "True, 
automobile sales fell, but almost all other sectors experienced nice 
increases." 
</P>
<P>
Auto dealers have been hit hard by sluggish sales over the past several months, 
and they turned to rebates and other discounts to clear their lots in December 
and January. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of durable goods, items made to last three or more years, were down by 
0.3% last month to $54.8 billion, while the sales of non-durable goods were up 
by 0.4% to $91.7 billion, the department's Census Bureau said in its monthly 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The 0.9% decline in total retail sales for February compared with a surge of 
2.8% in January after a decline of 0.3% in December. 
</P>
<P>
In other categories during February, retail sales of building materials, 
hardware and garden supplies increased by 1.4%, and sales of furniture and home 
furnishings were up 0.5%. Sales at department stores increased by 2%, while 
sales at food stores were up 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline stations, meanwhile, saw sales decline by 0.8% in February, and drug 
stores also reported a 0.8% decline in business, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
But February retail sales increased by 1.6% at clothing stores, while 
restaurants and bars reported a 1.4% advance in sales.

Robert Mapplethorpe, the homosexual photographer whose work helped spark a 
controversy over government funding of the arts, has left $1.3 million to the 
two hospitals that treated him for AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Israel Medical Center in New York received $1 million and New England 
Deaconess Hospital in Boston received $300,000, it was announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Mapplethorpe died of AIDS a year ago at the age of 42. 
</P>
<P>
"Robert Mapplethorpe's legacy as an artist is well established," said Michael 
Stout, president of the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation. "This gift is his 
legacy as a caring human being who wanted to make life more bearable for people 
with AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
After his death, Mapplethorpe's works, along with those of artist Andres 
Serrano, ignited a firestorm when Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) objected to 
government funding of an art show entitled "The Perfect Moment," a Mapplethorpe 
retrospective that included photographs depicting gay couples and 
sadomasochistic images in addition to his trademark shots of flowers and 
celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
The Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C. canceled the show in response to 
pressure from Helms and other congressmen, after which several Corcoran board 
members resigned and artists pulled out of Corcoran shows to protest the 
cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Corcoran president Christina Orr-Cahall was forced to resign, and 
Congress passed a ban keeping the National Endowment for the Arts from funding 
art deemed "obscene." The ban expires September 30.

ABC's "Funniest Home Videos" was the top show of last week, but CBS won the 
Sunday night on which it aired and NBC took the week as usual, it was reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rather strange," said Sari DeCesare, NBC manager of audience research. 
"What's happened is that ABC has an isolated show." 
</P>
<P>
"Home Videos" was up there alone in the numbers. The show that preceded it, 
"Life Goes On," tied for 65th place with an 8.8 rating and a 15 share. "Home 
Videos" was No. 1 with a whopping 24.1 rating and a 37 share -- up an 
incredible 22 share points. Then along came "Elvis," tied for 47th with an 11.1 
rating and a 17 share. 
</P>
<P>
Where did all the viewers go? To "The Simpsons" on Fox, which airs in the 
subsequent half-hour and won its time period for the first time ever. It was in 
20th place with a 15.1 rating and a 23 share. 
</P>
<P>
All this has put "Murder, She Wrote" in 29th place, knocking it out of its 
accustomed spot as time period winner -- but that has not knocked CBS out of 
first place on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is "60 Minutes," which is in its second week with Andy Rooney back. 
It came in sixth with a 19.6 rating and a 34 share, about the show's average 
before the Rooney fracas. That's not as good as the previous week, when 
Rooney's return boosted the show to fourth place with a 22 rating and a 37 
share. 
</P>
<P>
NBC won the Sunday movie contest with "Perry Mason: The Case of the Desperate 
Deception," which came in 13th. On CBS "The People's Choice Awards" tied for 
22nd, earning a 14.9 rating and a 24 share, way down from last year when it had 
a 19.6 rating and a 31 share. ABC's repeat of "The Women of Brewster Place," 
Part 1, tied for 62nd place. 
</P>
<P>
NBC won the ratings race for the week for the 21st consecutive time, and 89th 
out of the last 90 weeks. The network took the week ending March 11 with a 13.5 
rating and a 22 share, according to the A. C. Nielsen Co. ABC was back in 
second place with an 12.2 rating and a 20 share, while CBS was third with an 
11.0 rating and an 18 share. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-week-old season-to-date ratings show NBC with a 14.8 rating and a 24 
share, ABC with a 13.0 rating and a 21 share, and CBS with a 12.3 rating and a 
20 share.

Disabled demonstrators in wheelchairs were arrested in the U.S. Capitol today 
after confronting House leaders with demands for quick passage of legislation 
guaranteeing them civil rights protections. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of more than 100 demonstrators threatened civil disobedience and 
interrupted House Speaker Thomas S. Foley and House Republican Leader Bob 
Michel as the congressional leaders tried to speak over the din in the 
cavernous Capitol Rotunda. 
</P>
<P>
After the congressmen left, about 70 of the people with disabilities assembled 
in the center of the Rotunda and began chanting in a planned attempt to provoke 
arrest. Capitol police, standing nearby, encircled the protesters and began 
taking them into custody. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Capitol, government-owned vans were lined up, and police began 
placing the protesters -- most in wheelchairs -- into the vehicles.

LIZ SMITH: CHAPLIN ON FILM, PEPPERY PECCADILLOES AND ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
CHARLIE CHAPLIN's widow, Oona O'Neill, has resisted, for the 12 years since her 
husband's death, all attempts to bring the great comic's life to the screen. 
Now she has finally given Sir Richard Attenborough the go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Lady Chaplin was afraid her husband's biography would be 
unnecessarily sensationalized, given his well-publicized sexual peccadilloes 
with very young ladies. Some he married. His first two wives were 16 when they 
became his brides. Some he did not. (Joan Barry, who brought a successful 
paternity suit against him in the 1940s.) 
</P>
<P>
Chaplin, who was born in London and never acquired U.S. citizenship, also fell 
victim to the McCarthy communist witch hunt of the early '50s. He was virtually 
hounded out of the United States, much to the delight of gossip columnists 
Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons, who had never approved of his romantic 
escapades anyway. Chaplin did not set foot on American soil for 20 years, and 
only then to accept a special Academy Award in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
However, Attenborough says, "Lady Chaplin has given me access to all his 
private papers and letters and has given me carte blanche to make the film the 
way I want." Filming starts in London in November. It is to be directed by 
Bryan Forbes. The role of Chaplin has yet to be cast, but Attenborough 
cautions: "He can't be more than 5-foot-something and he will have to age from 
18 to 76."

ELAINE STRITCH is just zipping along. Miz Stritch, so good in the recent PBS 
American Playhouse production "Sense and Sensibility," and who has popped up in 
such diverse entries as the sitcom "Head of the Class" and the TV movie 
"Sparks" with Victoria Principal, may be on the tube regularly. Elaine has been 
signed to play the Shirley MacLaine role in the projected "Steel Magnolias" 
series for CBS. Elaine says she hopes it's a "go" because she wants to buy a 
house. "Anything I get from this is 'house money.' " Before shooting starts on 
the "Magnolias" pilot, Elaine performs A. R. Gurney's "Love Letters" with Jason 
Robards in Boston, later this month.

CHICAGO'S RED HOT Steppenwolf Theater Company arrives in previews at Broadway's 
Cort in New York today with their adaptation of John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of 
Wrath." Director Frank Galati also did the work transforming Steinbeck's famous 
novel of the Great Depression into a stage production. This "Wrath" stars Gary 
Sinise, Terry Kinney, Jeff Perry and Lois Smith. Steinbeck's widow, Elaine, has 
traveled extensively with the show through its acclaimed engagements in 
Chicago, California and London.

DON'T MISS attorney Raoul Lionel Felder's editorial in Newsweek titled "Look 
Out, Donald!" Felder has done a witty and considered take on why he thinks 
"L'Affaire Trump" is not necessarily good for business, as Donald says it is. 
</P>
<P>
Felder also notes the new fly in the ointment -- Ivana's "handhold on a 
slippery ledge which may not be enough to win her case, but enough perhaps to 
cause Donald, for all practical purposes, to lose his." This revolves around 
the last contract between the couple in which Trump's lawyers failed to 
distinguish between "marital property" and "separate property." Felder notes 
that, in any event, even if Ivana loses on this point, her case cannot be 
thrown out of court before extensive financial disclosure. That is just what 
Trump doesn't want.

Actor Paul Michael Glaser and his wife, Elizabeth, who is infected by the AIDS 
virus, told a House committee hearing today they are seeking new stars for 
their campaign to help children with the disease -- President and Mrs. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Glaser became infected with the AIDS virus through a blood 
transfusion she received while delivering the Glasers' first child in 1981 and 
subsequently passed the virus on to both of the couple's children. 
</P>
<P>
The Glasers' daughter died in 1988 at age 7, but their son and Elizabeth Glaser 
have not yet developed AIDS symptoms. Paul Michael Glaser, star of the "Starsky 
and Hutch" TV series, has not been infected. 
</P>
<P>
The Glasers recently made a public service advertisement on AIDS featuring 
former President Ronald Reagan and said they need the White House's help to 
reach Americans who are not concerned about victims of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Glaser, a founder of the Pediatric AIDS Foundation, said she spoke 
with one of Mrs. Bush's aides last month about the First Lady making her own 
television commercial, but has not received a response. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush's spokeswoman said that the First Lady had not received a written 
request to make a public service ad and that there will be no response until 
one had been made.

LITHUANIAN INDEPENDENCE 'ILLEGAL,' GORBACHEV SAYS

Mikhail S. Gorbachev today called Lithuania's declaration of independence 
"illegal and invalid" but urged patience, saying Moscow's relations with the 
Baltic republic will continue unchanged for now. 
</P>
<P>
He said a commission was studying how to respond to Lithuania's action. 
</P>
<P>
In comments to the Congress of People's Deputies, Gorbachev indicated that 
Lithuania's independence drive is likely to encounter formidable resistance. He 
said the Kremlin will not begin negotiations with the three Baltic republics on 
the independence they are seeking. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot talk about negotiations," he said. "You carry out negotiations with 
a foreign country." 
</P>
<P>
But several lawmakers said it was likely Gorbachev will soften his position. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader told the 2,000 deputies that Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov and a 
commission were studying the Lithuanian "situation." On Sunday, Lithuania's 
legislature reclaimed the sovereignty the nation lost 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev won applause from the Congress when he said the Kremlin will not give 
in to demands to negotiate independence with republics seeking independence, 
including the other two Baltic states -- Latvia and Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanians want recognition as a sovereign state and the start of talks on 
secession. On Monday, the Estonians called for talks with Moscow on 
independence. All three republics were forcibly annexed in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, calling the Lithuanians "comrades," Gorbachev paused and then 
said, "I think they are comrades." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader made a point of welcoming the presence of Lithuanian deputies 
at the Congress. But Lithuanian Deputy Vaidotas Antanaitis said they now 
considered themselves observers. 
</P>
<P>
Antanaitis read excerpts from the declaration of independence, together with 
appeals for recognition of their sovereignty. He said Lithuania wants good 
relations with Moscow and called for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev offered no reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Another Lithuanian deputy, Algimountas Chekuolis, said he believed that the 
Soviet leader will soften his position. "Gorbachev is a realist," he said. 
"He'll change his stand." 
</P>
<P>
Ingrik Toome, a deputy and premier of Estonia, said Estonians and Latvians were 
upset by Gorbachev's statement that there would be no negotiations, but added 
that the Soviet leader might not yet have fully explained his position. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, many of his political steps have shown that he has to start these 
negotiations," Toome said.

U.S. Sen. Bob Kerrey has renewed his acquaintance with actress Debra Winger, 
lately divorced from Timothy Hutton, a Kerrey aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Winger and her son, Noah, were spending several days in Omaha this week during 
the Senate recess, said Steve Jarding, Kerrey's press aide. 
</P>
<P>
Then-Gov. Kerrey met Winger in 1983 when she was filming "Terms of Endearment" 
in Lincoln. Their love affair ended in the fall of 1985, but Kerrey and Winger 
remained friends, Jarding said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Winger married Hutton. The couple had Noah a year later. Hutton, who 
starred in the film "Ordinary People," filed for divorce in December. Winger is 
a business partner with Kerrey in the Prairie Life Center, a fitness center in 
Omaha.

Mandela told reporters on the second day of a five-day visit to Sweden: "I am

Mikhail S. Gorbachev won a decisive victory today when the Soviet parliament 
approved his plans to create a powerful executive presidency and also to end 
the Communist Party's 72-year monopoly on power. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition had predicted a very close vote but the Congress passed the 
presidential measure by a vote of 1,817 to 133, with 61 abstentions. A 
two-thirds majority of the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies was 
required for the motion to pass. 
</P>
<P>
The presidency bill creates a chief executive who can propose legislation, veto 
laws passed by the Supreme Soviet legislature, declare war or martial law and 
overrule Cabinet members. Vice President Anatoly Lukyanov said it also clearly 
separates executive and legislative powers for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
The parliament routed opponents of the new presidency, who feared that it might 
lead to the re-establishment of a Stalin-like dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
"We are standing before the greatest, most meaningful step in the history of 
our government," Gorbachev told the parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first step toward a Western political system," Deputy Fyodor 
Burlatsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Later today, the deputies were expected to nominate Gorbachev to a four-year 
term as president, then decide whether the Congress or the public would elect 
the new president. 
</P>
<P>
It is expected that after the initial four years, the term will become five 
years and the president would be popularly elected. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has argued that the more powerful presidency is needed to keep the 
Soviet Union intact as he presses ahead with his reforms while facing a 
crumbling economy and growing independence movements. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanians had been so dismayed by the proposal on the more powerful 
presidency that they rushed to declare independence before it passed on Sunday. 
Estonia, Latvia and Georgia have all taken moves in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
To succeed today, Gorbachev backed off some demands that had disturbed 
legislators from some republics, who believed that he would have too much 
power. Those demands included the president's right to declare on his own a 
state of emergency and to suspend the parliaments of the republics. 
</P>
<P>
Lukyanov said the bill allows Congress to recall the president for breaking the 
law and restricts the passage of legislation to the Congress and the Supreme 
Soviet, the standing legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The vote on scrapping the party's leading role passed in the Congress by a vote 
of 1,771 to 164, with 74 abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
The historic change in Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution drops language 
defining the Communist Party as the "leading and guiding force of Soviet 
society and the nucleus of its political system, of all state organizations and 
public organizations." 
</P>
<P>
The new article reads, "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, other party, 
trade union and youth organizations, other social organizations and mass 
movements, shall participate, through their representatives elected to the 
Soviets of People's Deputies as well as in other ways, in shaping the policies 
of the Soviet state and in running the state and social affairs."

Two elderly women involved in a four-car crash died after their car rolled over 
a 50-foot embankment and landed in a Newport Beach shopping center parking lot, 
police said today. 
</P>
<P>
The two women and their husbands were visiting from Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Their car crashed with three others at 11:15 p.m. Monday at the intersection of 
Jamboree Road and East Pacific Coast Highway in Newport Beach, Sgt. Andy Gonis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Coroner's investigators identified one of the women as Mary Riley, 77. The 
other woman's name was being withheld until relatives could be notified. She 
also was 77. 
</P>
<P>
Their husbands reportedly were taken to local hospitals with injuries. Two 
other people were also hurt, but no information on conditions of the four were 
available. Preliminary details of the accident were sketchy. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a big crash, and it's going to take awhile to figure out what 
happened," Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that after the crash, the car with the elderly couples continued to 
roll over an embankment at Jamboree Road. The car became airborne as it bounced 
down the 50-foot hill and landed in the Bayside Shopping Center parking lot. 
The cause of the accident is still being investigated, he said.

The Blue Jays today exercised the 1990 option in the contract of right-hander 
Dave Stieb for $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of Stieb's contract, signed in March, 1985, the team had until 
Thursday to renew his option for 1990 or buy out the contract for $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
His salary for the 1990 season would have been guaranteed automatically if 
Stieb had pitched in 225 or more innings in 1989, but he pitched 206 2/3 
innings last season. 
</P>
<P>
Stieb was 17-8 in 1989 with a 3.35 earned-run average. He is the club's 
all-time leader in several categories: victories (148), strikeouts (1,432) and 
complete games (99).

President Guillermo Endara announced today he was ending his 13-day fast in 
solidarity with Panama's poor, saying he did not want to endanger his health or 
his ability to lead the country. 
</P>
<P>
Endara told a news conference in the Metropolitan Cathedral where he has lived 
and worked since beginning the fast March 1 that he had planned to end it when 
his conscience told him it was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Endara, who is overweight, said that, while he still felt able to continue 
without food, "I don't want to put my health in danger, or my capacity . . . to 
guide the government." 
</P>
<P>
He said he had lost 17 pounds and now weighed 232 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Through the 13-day fast, Endara said it was not a protest at the delay in U.S. 
aid to help rebuild Panama's struggling economy, which is suffering the effects 
of U.S. sanctions and years of corruption and mismanagement.

Pete Rose, former manager of the Cincinnati Reds, said today he is in no hurry 
to apply for reinstatement but is eager to get into baseball's Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried about getting back in baseball in a non-playing role," Rose 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm anticipating the Hall of Fame. You don't need to be reinstated to go to 
the Hall of Fame." 
</P>
<P>
Rose, who last played in 1986, will be eligible for election by the baseball 
writers after the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
Rose was banned from baseball for life Aug. 24 because of illegal gambling 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
Attending a charity luncheon of Crossroads Rehabilitation Center here, Rose 
commented on the contract dispute that threatens the start of the season: "I 
don't think baseball needs any changes right now because the owners and players 
are making top dollar and the fans are happy." 
</P>
<P>
Rose said the loss of the spring training games should not have too much of an 
effect on the season.

Organizers of the Goodwill Games said today after a White House meeting that 
there is a good chance President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
will visit the competition this summer in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling at the White House is very favorable," said the Rev. William J. 
Sullivan, chairman of the board of directors for the Seattle Organizing 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my own personal judgment that if President Bush decides to come, I think 
Mr. Gorbachev in all probability would come too." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, president of Seattle University, said he thinks the odds are better 
than 50-50 that both world leaders will attend. 
</P>
<P>
"The kind of public relations person Gorbachev is, I don't think he'd pass up 
the opportunity," Sullivan said.

AROUND-THE-WORLD YACHT RACE SAILS ON SEA OF COMMERCIALS

<P>
If all the world is a stage, the Whitbread 'Round-the-World sailboat race has 
finally switched the klieg lights on in Earth's last, great, remote wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Yachts bearing the logos of beer brewers, cigarette makers, kitchen equipment 
manufacturers and ladies' shoemakers are streaking across wild seas these days, 
risking death and destruction in a quest for market share and corporate 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
It presents an interesting ethical puzzle: high sport, but in the name of what? 
</P>
<P>
After two weeks in Punta del Este, Uruguay, observing and chatting up Whitbread 
voyagers while they rested between legs of their 33,000-mile torture test, I'm 
still unsure how to rate the event. 
</P>
<P>
On one hand, it's the grandest sailing imaginable -- hurtling around Antarctica 
in full race rock, flying spinnakers for days on end in 40 knots of wind, 
surfing down mountainous waves in the dark of night as icebergs whiz by. 
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable," marveled a young New Zealander after his maiden Cape Horn 
rounding. "We had 80 knots (of wind) across the deck; we were knocked down, 
fighting for our lives for two hours." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, you can't help noticing the message these folks defy death 
to deliver. It's plastered all over the spinnakers and the sides of the boats: 
"Drink our beer, smoke our cigarettes, get your latest stock quotations from 
our computerized service." 
</P>
<P>
Nautical NASCAR, in short, and it's only just beginning. After 17 years, the 
Whitbread is finally finding its way into big corporate boardrooms. "Tobacco 
wars next time," promised Mike Pavitt of Rothman's, the British cigarette 
company's entry. 
</P>
<P>
Based on his success this time, Pavitt expects at least two fully funded U.S. 
tobacco entries in the 1993-94 Whitbread from R. J. Reynolds and Philip Morris. 
Why? Because the race, he said, offers what cigarette makers can't otherwise 
buy: Their brand names in the worldwide media, bathed in a positive light. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman's spent more than $6 million launching and campaigning its maxi-boat, 
with a fully paid crew and a world-class skipper, former America's Cup helmsman 
Lawrie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
And with more than 100 hours of global TV in the books, it was worth every 
shilling, said Pavitt, chain-smoking his own brand over an elegant lunch at the 
Yacht Club Punta del Este. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Rothman's is lurching along in fourth place, the exposure in 
yachting-mad England, New Zealand and Australia, where Rothman's sells big, has 
been thoroughly gratifying, Pavitt said. His company can hardly wait to do it 
all over again. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Whitbread heads for the first time to the world's greatest consumer 
marketplace -- the United States -- leaving Punta del Este on Saturday for an 
expected arrival three or four weeks later in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The sailors aren't exactly clicking their heels at the prospect of head winds 
up to Rio de Janeiro, then the doldrums before reaching the easterly trade 
winds in the Caribbean. "The best part of this race is over," said Dale 
Tremaine, a paid hand on Fazisi, the first Soviet entry in a transoceanic race. 
</P>
<P>
But for the market-share moguls, the best part is just coming up. They want to 
see whether free-spending Americans stand and salute when the big racing boats 
roll over the horizon and up the Florida Gold Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The likelihood of that, by most accounts, is slim. "It's not unusual for our 
country to be oblivious to events like this," said John Marshall, Dennis 
Conner's right-hand man in the last four America's Cups who has just signed on 
with Italian industrialist Gianni Varasi to help organize a 1993 Whitbread 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
So why the Whitbread for Marshall? "I think it's one of the most, maybe the 
most, challenging and difficult of sailing events," he said, "and this year it 
was elevated to the highest levels of intensity and competitiveness." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall counted off the five boats at the top of the maxi-boat class -- 
Steinlager II, which has won every leg so far; Merit, the Swiss entry; Fisher 
&amp; Paykel, representing a New Zealand kitchen appliance manufacturer; 
Rothman's, and Charles Jourdan, the French sloop. 
</P>
<P>
Big boats, big budgets, big names, big businesses: beer, cigarettes, 
appliances, women's apparel. But is this yachting? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, whether by accident or not," Marshall said, "commercialism came in at 
the same time the event was elevated to the top levels of competition. And if 
it takes commercial sponsorship to get the best boats and the best sailors into 
the most challenging event, I'm all for it." 
</P>
<P>
All of which puts the Whitbread on a bit of a collision course with its 
founders, the small, tradition-bound Whitbread brewery in England and the 
creaky Royal Naval Sailing Assn., which Whitbread assigned to oversee the race 
from its inception 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Is the Whitbread destined for world-class commercial sporting event status? Not 
if the founding fathers can help it. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no," said race committee chief Charles Williams, a retired Royal Navy 
admiral. "The RNSA would never permit itself to be involved in a race where 
there was something in it -- $1 million or something like that -- for the 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
"These fellows (the sailors) are in for the adventure. It's exciting, dangerous 
-- an Everest expedition. They're competing for the thrill, the challenge, the 
endeavor. Money has nothing to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Hmmmm . . . .
