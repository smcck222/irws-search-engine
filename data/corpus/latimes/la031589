"When I wore our old hat, I felt like an ice-cream man," joked Lou Gutierrez, a 
California Highway Patrol Officer based in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
California prides itself on being a fashion leader, but it's sadly out of vogue 
in the category of state trooper hats. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it's one of just a handful of states that still uses the ice-cream (or 
bus) driver types. Now, though, CHP officers are being given the option of 
wearing a flat-brimmed model during a six-month experiment to see whether a 
wardrobe change should be made. 
</P>
<P>
If the CHP's East Los Angeles office is indicative, the hard-straw, 
drill-instructor-type variety is a hit. About half the officers have dug into 
their wallets to buy one (price: $32), and more are expected to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
"They're great-looking," said Officer Donna De Weese. 
</P>
<P>
But fashion isn't the only consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The new hats also reduce exposure to direct sunlight and the chance of 
contracting skin cancer. 
</P>
<P>
CHP spokesman Sam Haynes added, however, that one argument against the flat 
brims is that in other states "it's a fairly popular game" when officers are 
standing by the side of the road "for large trucks to drive by closely and 
create a funnel that knocks off the hat." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't often that a retriever needs retrieving. But when a San Fernando 
Valley woman's Jeep was stolen the other evening, her golden retriever, Bo, 
happened to be in the back seat. Police later found the car on Central Avenue 
south of downtown. The car -- and easy-going Bo -- seemed none the worse for 
wear. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's Irish on St. Patrick's Day," says Shevaun O'Sullivan, explaining 
how this year's parade in downtown Los Angeles could feature a king of Puerto 
Rican ancestry, a Polish-born queen and the Chinese historical society. 
</P>
<P>
The parade, which runs from First and Hope streets to City Hall, is also 
unusual in that it isn't even held on St. Patrick's Day, which is Friday. The 
parade is on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you're looking for an Irish march on Friday, Beautiful Downtown 
Ventura is holding its first-ever St. Patrick's Day parade at noon. Ventura's 
is also unique in that its grand marshal is deceased. A riderless horse will 
travel the route in honor of Camarillo rancher Bubby McCormick, who died late 
last year. "St. Patrick's Day was always very special to him," explained 
Ventura Mayor Jim Monahan. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said Ventura is a bit late in getting into the swing of St. Patrick's 
Day celebrations because "you know how the Irish are -- they're pretty 
disorganized. And I'm Irish myself." 
</P>
<P>
A recent item on the meaning of the call letters of local radio stations -- and 
the mystery of KNX's origins -- brought a letter from radio historian Robert 
Wold, who is writing a book on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Wold says one story holds that the "NX" portion of the station's letters 
referred to its early location in the annex of the Spring Arcade Building 
downtown. But, he adds, the truth seems to be that the station's call letters 
were simply arbitrarily assigned by the government, as was the custom back 
then. 
</P>
<P>
The same was apparently true of the now-defunct KHJ, which later held a 
listener contest to come up with three words that fit its call letters, 
settling on "Kindness, Happiness and Joy." KHJ, Wold says, even aired three 
chirping canaries with those names for a while -- "its version, I suppose, of 
the NBC chimes." 
</P>
<P>
Full disclosure mandates the following: 
</P>
<P>
A category spotlighted in a slide-show presentation at The Times' in-house 
awards ceremony saluted such skills as the "writting" of headlines. It was an 
editing award. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Andrews Productions Inc. was recently awarded damages of $1.8 million in 
Los Angeles County Superior Court against a former employee who was accused of 
misappropriating trade secrets and stealing the concept for a television game 
show. 
</P>

Name of the stolen show: "Anything for Money."

TRY EFFICIENCY BEFORE DRILLING THE WILDERNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY E. WIRTH, Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.) is a member of the Senate 
Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A press conference on the east lawn of the U.S. Capitol recently illustrated 
two contrasting visions of America's energy future. On one side of the lectern 
were two black 40-gallon barrels, representing the oil that might be contained 
in all yet-to-be explored U.S. oil fields. On the other stood a pyramid of 14 
barrels, symbolizing what could be saved by a modest energy-conservation 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The barrels' message was simple: The nation's energy problem is not that we 
have put big oil deposits off-limits to the oil companies and their drilling 
rigs. Rather, it is that we have failed to follow a common-sense strategy of 
energy efficiency, which could provide nearly 10 times as much oil as we can 
hope to find in areas like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has asked Congress to allow oil drilling in the Arctic refuge on 
Alaska's north coast. That would be an economic and environmental mistake. 
</P>
<P>
This refuge is an international treasure. It was established by President 
Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1960 to preserve unique wildlife and wilderness values. 
The refuge is the calving ground for a caribou herd of 170,000 whose spring 
gathering in the refuge is one of the world's most spectacular wildlife 
migrations. The refuge also provides an undisturbed habitat for polar bears and 
musk oxen only a short distance from one of the world's largest industrial 
complexes, the oil fields at Prudhoe Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The coastal plain of the refuge, about 1.5 million acres, is the most important 
part of the refuge for wildlife. This is the portion for which permission is 
being sought from Congress to issue oil leases. 
</P>
<P>
If George Bush wishes to be known as an environmental President, he should be 
advocating an energy policy that emphasizes conservation and enhanced recovery 
from existing oil fields, not ignoring our commitment to protect one of the 
country's most important areas for wildlife. Someday we may have to drill for 
oil in this refuge. But if the President is willing to drill for oil in the 
Arctic refuge when there are far better alternatives, then what area is safe? 
</P>
<P>
For eight years the Reagan Administration ignored energy efficiency. As a 
result, U.S. energy consumption per unit of gross national product, which had 
declined for 15 years in a row, is rising. The most egregious example of the 
Reagan Administration's policy was its repeated weakening of fuel-efficiency 
standards for U.S.-made automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
The eagerness to drill in the Arctic refuge while ignoring conservation is as 
wrong-headed as suggesting that if hot water is running out of your bathtub 
faster than it's coming in, what you need is a new water heater. The truth is, 
the sensible thing to do is to put a stopper in the tub. 
</P>
<P>
Calling for production of more oil, no matter where it may be found, is no 
substitute for a comprehensive energy policy. The debate over the Arctic refuge 
would be unnecessary if the Bush Administration would actively pursue the 
potential energy windfall from conservation and other opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
The improvement in the gas mileage of U.S.-manufactured automobiles since the 
first oil embargo saves the country 2.4 million barrels of oil every day. That 
is five times the most optimistic prediction for production from the Arctic 
refuge. 
</P>
<P>
And we clearly have the technology to perhaps do even better. In fact, just a 
1.5 mile-per-gallon increase in the fuel-efficiency standard for new cars, 
starting in 1993, would save more oil than the Arctic refuge is expected to 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
Better auto mileage isn't the only way for the United States to squeeze more 
economic and environmental benefits out of every barrel of oil. Millions of 
homes could be made more energy-efficient with insulation, storm windows and 
weather-stripping. The use of ethanol, methanol and clean-burning domestically 
produced natural gas as a vehicle fuel also can contribute to reducing our 
demand for oil. 
</P>
<P>
Energy conservation and alternative fuels do more than reduce our oil imports 
and our trade deficit. They help us fight pollution in our cities and reduce 
the carbon dioxide emissions that are a prime cause of global warming. 
</P>
<P>
Drilling for oil in the Arctic is a gamble. Proponents of drilling acknowledge 
that the odds of finding oil there are one in five. And if oil is found, it 
will run out. Where will we find the next oil field? Conservation, by contrast, 
is a sure thing that keeps paying dividends. 
</P>
<P>
The question of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge will be before 
the Senate Energy Committee this week. Our decision should give heavy weight to 
the value of wilderness and wildlife protection. We can hardly expect other 
nations to consider the environmental consequences of their development 
decisions if we refuse to do so ourselves. If the United States opens this 
refuge now, without first having exploited the immense potential of energy 
efficiency, we will be putting oil wells in the wilderness simply to keep gas 
guzzlers on the highway.

EAR-SPLITTING DINOSAUR JR.: LOUD, LACKADAISICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANISS GARZA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the already unusual world of alternative rock, Dinosaur Jr. manages to stand 
out. Its psychotic, psychedelic sound is driven by massive guitar noise and a 
pulsating rhythm section. In the middle of the mayhem, the trio will toss off 
an appealing melody, almost as if it's beside the point. No wonder they played 
to a full house at the Roxy on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
There were some problems. The recorded mumbling that filled the spaces between 
tunes was just plain annoying. Once or twice it was a striking effect, but not 
before every song. Even though LOUDNESS is at the essence of the band's being, 
the ear-splitting volume was downright painful. And while the music was loaded 
with dynamics, the three longhairs from Massachusetts displayed no personality 
as performers. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the musicianship shone brightly (if rather noisily), especially J 
Mascis' versatile guitar work. He soared sonically one moment, then dove into 
some jangling riffs, then explored pure, discordant noise. At times the music 
almost overcame the band's lackadaisical attitude, but staying home and 
listening to its current release, "Bug" (on SST Records), would have been as 
satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
The second-billed Lazy Cowgirls were as wild a presence as Dinosaur Jr. was 
dull. The frenzied playing and brash sarcasm made for a warped, powerful set 
from the four L.A. rockers. Don't Mean Maybe, which opened, is a forgettable, 
punkish trio that showed its Minutemen influence too strongly. JANISS GARZA

Susan St. James said Tuesday that if "Kate &amp; Allie" gets picked up by CBS 
for another year, she won't be back. "My reasons for not coming back and 
re-signing would strictly be that I have two small kids, as well as two older 
ones, and they would kind of like to see me around," St. James said on ABC's 
"Good Morning America." She has co-starred for six years with Jane Curtin as 
divorced women sharing an apartment. Curtin's character, Allie, remarried this 
season. "I don't know what everyone else's plans are. I couldn't speak for 
them. The network hasn't even called." St. James said she was happy with the 
"freshness" of the show this season -- it added new characters -- but not with 
the way CBS has bounced it around the schedule. ALEENE MacMINN

Columbia Pictures executives are reportedly ecstatic over the opening weekend 
grosses ($597,000, or $11,948 per screen) and exit poll responses of viewers to 
"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen," which opened in 50 theaters in eight 
cities on Friday. It had been rumored that a bad opening in those key markets, 
which include Los Angeles and New York, would cause the studio to pull back 
from a major national release pattern for the problem-plagued $40-million 
fantasy adventure. A studio source said plans were being made Tuesday afternoon 
for further expansion of the film into theaters nationwide. Columbia would not 
release its exit poll data, but Ed Mintz, who runs the independent exit poll 
firm Cinemascore, said "Munchausen" got very high marks from viewers leaving 
screenings at the Cineplex-Odeon Theater in Century City. Mintz said the film 
received an overall A- rating from viewers, but added that because 71% of the 
viewers were attracted by director Terry Gilliam, the rating may have been 
atypically high.

Actor Joe Don Baker starts work today on four episodes of NBC's "In the Heat of 
the Night," moving into the series while Carroll O'Connor recovers from 
sextuple coronary bypass surgery. Baker, who starred in "Walking Tall," will be 
seen as a neighboring sheriff who takes over while Police Chief Gillespie 
(O'Connor) is away at a seminar on domestic terrorism in Washington. O'Connor 
will still be seen in three shows that were taped before he underwent surgery 
last weekend in Atlanta. The Baker scripts are due to air next month. O'Connor, 
63, is "making excellent progress" and has been moved out of the intensive care 
unit at Emory University Hospital, his doctors report. ALEENE MacMINN

Country singer Willie Nelson will be on stage to reopen what's billed as the 
world's largest honky-tonk March 31. Billy Bob's Texas, in Fort Worth, boasts 
three stages, 42 bar stations, a live indoor rodeo, and can pack up to 6,500 
people into 100,000 square feet of floor space. The mammoth nightclub is 
resuming a seven-day-per-week schedule of entertainment under the new 
leadership of Ken Brixey, former general manager of Elvis Presley's Graceland 
mansion, who also managed Southfork Ranch, setting of TV's "Dallas." Brixey and 
a group of Fort Worth investors assumed the management of Billy Bob's Texas 
last November, 10 months after the failure of other investments forced the 
club's developer and namesake, Billy Bob Barnett, into bankruptcy. The club has 
opened on weekends since Brixey's Link Management Group took the reins. ALEENE

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: THREE BRAZILIAN FILMS DEAL WITH AFRICAN RELIGIOUS ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Afro-American Museum in Exposition Park commences a free monthly 
Sunday series of Afro-Brazilian films at noon with Nelson Periera dos Santos' 
"The Amulet of Ogum" (1975). All three films Sunday touch upon the African 
roots of Afro-Brazilian religion. Vera de Figueiredo's "Creation of the World: 
A Samba Opera" (1985) screens at 2:15, followed an hour later by Walter Lima 
Jr.'s "Chico Rei" (1986). The series is being presented in conjunction with the 
exhibition, "Introspectives: Contemporary Art by Americans and Brazilians of 
African Descent." 
</P>
<P>
"The Amulet of Ogum" is not one of the father of Cinema Novo's best films, but 
it fits well into the series. Tending to ramble even more than most Brazilian 
pictures, it's a volatile mixture of violence and voodoo. A fable told by a 
blind troubadour to three would-be attackers in the dark alleys of a Rio 
suburb, it celebrates the rituals of condomble, a mixture of the ancient 
African Yoruba religion and Catholic beliefs, and tells of the adventures of a 
young man, charmed at birth to be impervious to all physical injury, who 
becomes king of the underworld in Rio's slums. 
</P>
<P>
A Variety reviewer called "Creation of the World: A Samba Opera" a "front-row 
seat to the Carnival," but it is much more than that. De Figueiredo cuts from 
the dazzling parade of the samba schools, a highlight of Rio's famous annual 
celebration, to allow the dancers to act out in song and dance an ancient 
fertility rite, clearly of African origin, in a series of outdoor settings both 
rural and urban. It centers on the mating of the Yoruba goddess Odudua and the 
male god Obatala, which results in the creation of life. This is an infectious, 
highly sensual film featuring scores of stunning-looking people in costumes of 
the utmost splendor and elegance -- lacy, befeathered and bespangled 
silver-and-white dominates. The participants are all working-class people, 
apparently without formal training in singing and dancing, but they are kings 
and queens for a day in finery that would strike envy in the heart of the 
producer of a Broadway musical (or a Vegas revue). Yet amid all the glitter 
there emerges a spirit of joy and laughter -- and never the crassness of 
hard-edged show business. 
</P>
<P>
Filmed in 1979 and 1980 but held up for exhibition until three years ago, 
"Chico Rei" is a remarkable saga of spiritual survival in the face of the 
extreme and enduring hardships of slavery. It commences in the 18th Century 
with as harrowing a re-enactment of the horrors of the slave ship as one could 
imagine and moves on to a picturesque colonial town nestled in the mountains of 
the Minas Gerais province. Ironically, it's a Shangri-la setting for the 
terrible suffering of the slaves whose wives were sent off to Bahia while they 
are put to laboring in the gold mines, often castrated in the belief that this 
somehow would make them better workers. 
</P>
<P>
In this sprawling fresco of a film its central figure gradually emerges. He is 
the slaves' king back in the Congo, Galanga (Severo D'Acelino), a tall, 
imposing man now known as Chico Rei who continues to be his people's spiritual 
leader even in chains. With power and imagination Lima, a colleague of the late 
Glauber Rocha, depicts the transformation of man into myth. In the process we 
discover how the slaves were sustained by their music -- they were allowed 
drums -- and by preserving their African gods and beliefs by concealing and 
melding them in Catholic ritual. It's almost needless to say that these three 
films boast the most wonderfully intoxicating music.

U.S. POLICY PUNISHES 'KILLING FIELDS' SURVIVORS; 
</P>
<P>
LINGERING ANTI-VIETNAMESE BIAS PUSHES AMERICA TO OPEN DOOR TO KHMER ROUGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Scientists (FAS).

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. policy toward Cambodia is immoral, impractical and, above all, 
undesirable; our nation has probably never had a policy so unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
As our government and the Chinese government know full well -- but prefer not 
to dwell upon -- the Vietnamese were brutally and repeatedly attacked by Pol 
Pot and the Khmer Rouge from at least September, 1977, and tried for more than 
a year to get the Chinese to mediate and the United Nations to support a 
demilitarized zone. (On May 10, 1978, Phnom Penh radio was actually calling on 
the people to exterminate the Vietnamese race: "In terms of numbers, one of us 
must kill 30 Vietnamese . . . ."). When Vietnamese efforts to negotiate failed, 
Vietnam dealt with these attacks as the United States dealt with Japan after 
World War II -- overthrowing the Pol Pot regime in 1979 and constructing a new 
and less hostile government. In the process, the Vietnamese saved the Cambodian 
people from extermination by the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, it is an extraordinary tribute to the 
anti-Vietnamese feeling in Beijing and Washington, and the influence of these 
two superpowers, that the international community continues to call this 
Vietnamese action "illegal" when so many analogous cases are called 
"self-defense" and promptly recognized. 
</P>
<P>
This policy is intensely immoral since it has led us, under Chinese pressure, 
to permit the Khmer Rouge -- who have committed the most genocidal actions of 
this century -- to hold the U.N. seat as the legitimate government of Cambodia. 
This denied the survivors of the Cambodian holocaust access to U.N. agencies 
such as WHO, UNESCO and the U.N. Development Programme. And it kept the Khmer 
Rouge in business killing civilians from its base camps in Thailand and 
committing the same atrocities its had before on all who came under its 
control. The Western effort to give this policy a face-lift some years ago by 
pressuring Prince Sihanouk into a coalition with the Khmer Rouge cost still 
more lives as innocent peasants were misled into volunteering for what they 
thought was a Sihanouk movement only to find themselves under Khmer Rouge 
control. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent visit to Hanoi and Phnom Penh, it also became clear how 
impractical and undesirable our policy has been. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Hun Sen's government is not about to "dismantle" its 10-year-old 
government in return for the "dismantling" of the Khmer Rouge governmment, 
which does not control an inch of Cambodian territory but is simply a U.N. 
fiction. 
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN governments, to whose policy the U.S. position has been blindly 
hitched, are reversing themselves rapidly. The Hun Sen government is being 
received in the "front-line" state of Thailand and is receiving Thai generals 
in return. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, the less anti-Vietnamese ASEAN states are scrambling to open some 
kind of relations with Hanoi and Phnom Penh now that the political dam has 
broken. Even Prince Sihanouk has given up on the negotiations that are so often 
pressed by us in his name. He did not attend the Jakarta talks last year and 
called them a "cynical comedy acted out shamelessly by the Vietnamese 
colonialists and their valets in Phnom Penh." In return, the ASEAN participants 
simply make no reference to this presumed leader. 
</P>
<P>
But, above all, U.S. policy is worse than a crime; it is a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
No Khmer government will ever want less than independence from the Vietnamese. 
The perpetual triumph of nationalist feelings over ideology in that part of the 
world has been proven definitively by the tensions and fighting that broke out 
immediately upon the end of the Vietnamese war -- with communists fighting 
communists. And as Hun Sen told me in February, his government wants its own 
"hat" and is not acting like other socialist governments. Free enterprise is 
fully accepted as is freedom of religion. There is as much freedom of speech 
and action, I believe, as there was under Prince Sihanouk's regime. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, according to foreign observers with whom I spoke in Phnom Penh, 
the Hun Sen government is as disciplined and devoted to the public needs as can 
be expected and more so than the Lon Nol and Sihanouk governments. It has 
brought the country from ground zero, with few educated persons left from the 
Pol Pot genocide, to the point where the government is running. And progress 
continues apace. 
</P>
<P>
The horse we are backing, Prince Sihanouk, as mercurial as ever, consults with 
no one and never abides criticism. There is not the slightest sign that he 
would run a democratic government -- he has always believed he was the father 
of his people, not their elected leader. 
</P>
<P>
In Indochina last month, I met with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach 
and Deputy Premier Gen. Vo Nyugen Giap, as well as many observers in Phnom 
Penh. They all see that the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces will leave the West 
with nothing to complain about while it continues to support the Khmer Rouge 
coalition. They are right to think that this leaves the West and the Chinese in 
an intensely embarrassing blind alley. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that our government would find Hun Sen much more palatable than 
Prince Sihanouk, infinitely more reliable and more likely to last. He wants, 
obviously, to have relations with us and has offered through a representative 
to discuss, in particular, the the remains of Americans that his government has 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Spooked by communism as our country has been, and by the loss of the Vietnamese 
war, it is, perhaps, understandable that we did not recognize the People's 
Republic of Kampuchea at the outset. But there is little choice now. And the 
PRK is running the best government that tortured Cambodia has ever had. 
</P>
<P>
How long are we going to continue punishing the poor, punishing the victims of 
this holocaust, in the name of a patently distorted application of 
international law?

A NEW ENDANGERED SPECIES BLOOMS IN GORMAN: BEAUTY ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE BARNBAUM, Bruce Barnbaum is a photographer, writer and 
environmentalist who lives in the Ventura County town of Somis. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you have ever driven from Los Angeles to Bakersfield and beyond, you have 
passed Gorman on the top of the Ridge Route before dropping down into the San 
Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman has a few gas stations where you may have stopped for a refill, a store, 
a restaurant or two, a motel or two, and not much of anything else. Behind 
Gorman is a set of steep, rounded hills. Those hills tend to be bare and brown 
for about eight months of the year, generally from late May through December; 
they turn white with snow in winter when cold storms sweep through, then green 
when the snow melts away. We had two such storms this season -- in December and 
again in February -- and the hills were quite lovely then. 
</P>
<P>
In April those hills will burst into a rainbow of flowers. Yellows, blues, 
oranges, purples, light greens, reds -- it's almost garish. The only flower in 
the mosaic whose name I know is our state flower, the California poppy. But 
it's not the names that matter, it's the spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
Winds usually blow across those rainbowed hillsides, and if you stand on the 
road at their base or walk up into them (feeling guilty as you step on the 
thick carpet of flowers), you can see waves of colors rippling like a 
psychedelic ocean. 
</P>
<P>
For one month each year, those hills above Gorman may be the loveliest place on 
Earth. By late May, they will turn colorless again. 
</P>
<P>
I have often wondered why the state hasn't purchased those hills as a park, to 
be protected and enjoyed for the one month each year that nature puts on its 
show. We should have done so long ago. 
</P>
<P>
It may be too late now. The winds that ripple those lovely flower-bedecked 
hills are proving attractive for developers of wind power. A proposal has been 
made to build an array of wind turbines there. Concrete pads with their tall 
towers and noisy propellers would replace the flower show. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, poppies aren't an endangered species, nor are the other flowers that 
grace those hillsides. We can grow them all in our backyards. But somehow it 
wouldn't be the same. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, we need energy, and wind certainly supplies a clean, 
non-depletable source. It's hard to argue against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Do we really need beauty? And do we need it if it's there only one month out of 
a whole year? The way I see it, we do. Let me draw an analogy. Do we need to 
eat? None of us spends more than two hours a day eating. That's only 
one-twelfth of a day, one-twelfth of a year. But that intake of food nurtures 
us and keeps us going. I think that beauty nurtures us as well,and I think that 
one-twelfth of a year is worth it. 
</P>
<P>
We've lost so much already. Just look around us. The California flag features a 
grizzly bear, but the last free-roaming grizzly in California was shot to death 
in 1923. Today we simply honor its memory. 
</P>
<P>
The California condor, with its 8-foot wingspan, used to fly over the flowered 
hills above Gorman. But man encroached on the condor's habitat, and today the 
24 remaining condors are all captive in a breeding program started in the hope 
of eventually returning them to the wild. Shall we encroach still more on their 
shrunken range while they remain caged, further diminishing the possibility of 
their return to nature? Will we honor the condor only in memory? 
</P>
<P>
We've lost California's largest mammal, and it appears likely that we will lose 
our largest bird, too. Are we setting our sights on our state flower next? 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't nature count anymore? 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't beauty mean anything? 
</P>
<P>
Can't we make a state park out of those hills?

KINGS FILL IN BLANK AT QUEBEC; 
</P>
<P>
HRUDEY STOPS 24 SHOTS IN L.A.'S FIRST SHUTOUT OF THE SEASON, 4-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

QUEBEC CITY, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kelly Hrudey was saying after the game that he doesn't have a bonus clause in 
his contract for shutouts because he's no shutout king. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not. But he was a King with a shutout Tuesday night after a 4-0 victory 
over the Quebec Nordiques before 15,399 at Le Colisee. 
</P>
<P>
His first shutout since being traded from the New York Islanders was also the 
first shutout for the Kings this season, the first since Glenn Healy beat the 
Canucks at Vancouver, 2-0, in February of last season. 
</P>
<P>
That's a long time without a shutout, but then the Kings aren't exactly known 
as a defensive team. They're the highest-scoring team in the league and they've 
given up 300 goals this season. All the more reason for them to savor the 
moment the defensive effort that gave them a sweep of their three-game series 
with the struggling Nordiques. 
</P>
<P>
The victory also gave the Kings (37-28-6) sole possession of second place in 
the Smythe Division, putting them two points ahead of Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really nice to see all the players making such a concerted effort on 
defense when the game was not in doubt anymore," Hrudey said. "It seemed like 
they were trying to help preserve the shutout." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky, who didn't appear to be bothered that he was held to just one 
assist and nary a shot on goal, said: "I think we played very well. We did a 
lot of things that we wanted to do. That was smart hockey. . . . In order to 
play in the playoffs we have to think of defense; we have to be able to win 
games that are 3-2 or 2-1, games that are one-goal games or tied going into the 
third period. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been playing that way for the last little while. Maybe the last two 
weeks we've executed very good defense." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings have been concentrating on defense since the team's players-only 
meeting in Buffalo on the last trip. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Tim Watters acknowledged that meeting as an important rallying point 
for the team. 
</P>
<P>
"We were aware of it even before that, but the meeting helped," Watters said. 
"Every team needs to get together like that from time to time. It was time for 
us to come together." 
</P>
<P>
Watters gave credit to the forwards for picking up the opposing forwards and 
slowing them a bit. "That makes a world of difference for the defensemen," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And the trickle-down effect is that Hrudey had to face only 24 shots on goal, 
only five in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
"The nucleus of the team realizes that we have to be more defensive, and 
they've been talking it up," King Coach Robbie Ftorek said. "It's good for the 
guys to see that we can play good defense and still get our scoring 
opportunities and cash in on them." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Kasper was killing a penalty on Gretzky (for tripping) when he got his 
opportunity to give the Kings a 1-0 lead at 8:09 of the first period. Kasper 
stole a pass in the Nordiques' zone and raced off on a breakaway to score, 
unassisted. 
</P>
<P>
Kasper got the short-handed goal by skating past the Quebec goal on the right 
side, holding up his shot while goalie Ron Tugnutt set up on the right and then 
backhanding it to the left. Mike Krushelnyski's power-play goal at 8:02 of the 
second period went off Tugnutt's glove and bounced off Nordique defenseman 
Steven Finn and into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Nicholls scored two goals (No. 62 and No. 63) in the third period. He 
scored the first after taking a pass from Luc Robitaille, who was behind the 
net, to make it 3-0 at 9:15. On the second, he slapped a long shot up the 
middle off a pass from Gretzky to make it 4-0 on a power play at 15:12. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we're strong defensively, we don't need to worry about our 
offense," Watters said. "We're always going to get our offensive chances." 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey said that taking away the passing lanes from the Nordiques consequently 
opened it up for the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Not in the wild, wide-open kind of game that they have been known to play; not 
like the last time they met the Nordiques, at the Forum, and beat them, 11-3. 
But enough. 
</P>
<P>
There were times when the game Tuesday night seemed to stagnate, stalled in the 
middle of the ice with neither team doing much of anything. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more the style of the game than a lack of intensity," Watters said. 
</P>
<P>
All around the Kings denied looking past the Nordiques (24-40-6) to tonight's 
game against the Canadiens in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens lead the league in points and have to rank as one of the 
favorites to win the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"I know how important the Canadiens' game is," Hrudey said. "That's why I was 
more worried about (Tuesday's) game. Mentally, you can't come out here and be 
thinking ahead. This was a real test of our character. You know how you're 
going to play against the good teams. But playing like this against a team 
that's struggling, that showed our character. 
</P>
<P>
"That showed our true colors." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Strips of tickets for all of the Kings' first-round playoff games will go on 
sale at the Forum Friday morning at 10. Tickets for individual playoff games 
will go on sale at the Forum Saturday night after the Kings' game against 
Calgary. . . . Roy Mlakar, vice president of the Kings, confirmed Tuesday that 
the Kings probably will not hold their training camp in Victoria, Canada, next 
fall. He said the Kings would announce their training camp site early next 
week. . . . Kelly Hrudey had three shutouts for the Islanders last season. . . 
. Hrudey is going home to New York after tonight's game in Montreal because his 
wife, Donna, is due to give birth to their second child. . . . Hrudey's record 
with the Kings is 5-2-1.

MORNING BRIEFING: DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: IT IS A NAME WITH A BIG FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In years to come, he might be known as Air Zaire or the Kinshasa Kid. 
</P>
<P>
For now, he is known as Dikembe Mutombo. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the name. 
</P>
<P>
By April, he could be wearing a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. championship 
watch. By 1991, he could be wearing three. 
</P>
<P>
That's how highly regarded Georgetown's 7-foot-2 sophomore is. 
</P>
<P>
After the Hoyas' title-game victory over Syracuse in the Big East Conference 
tournament, Newsday's Steve Jacobson overheared Mutombo joyously repeating: "I 
know we going to the Final Four. I know we going to the Final Four. I know we 
going to the Final Four." 
</P>
<P>
Up popped a radio reporter, who thrust a microphone in Mutombo's face. "So, 
you're going to the Final Four?" the reporter asked. 
</P>
<P>
Mutombo was taken aback. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope so," he said. 
</P>
<P>
More Mutombo: Mike Saylor, an assistant coach at Indiana State, made a 
concerted effort to recruit Mutombo. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Missouri Valley Conference, we have a lot of 6-6 centers," Saylor told 
Steve Berkowitz of the Washington Post. "I knew this guy could be a 
program-changer for us." 
</P>
<P>
But Georgetown got its man, and the loss still hurts Saylor. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me weeks to get over it," he said. "Even now, I have trouble watching 
him play on television. . . . Dikembe will become an NBA player. It's just a 
matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia: Who are Lenard Benjamin, Jacques Wilkins and Peter Tripucka? 
</P>
<P>
That Padre matter: No word yet from the Central California town of Lindsay, 
where school administrators, parents and community leaders are wondering what, 
if anything, to do about Steve Garvey Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing wrong with the school, it's just that in light of recent 
events, whenever its name is mentioned, there's a, uh, pregnant pause in the 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
The campus, with a student body of 370, was renamed in Garvey's honor in 1977. 
It was previously named after Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no discussion of changing the name (of the school) right now," said 
Bob Mohr, the school district superintendent "That doesn't mean that what 
(Garvey) is accused of in the press is what we are holding up as a guideline in 
our instructional programs." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of bed: Boston Red Sox General Manager Lou Gorman, a substitute in the 
team's radio booth recently, commented on a Wade Boggs single by saying, "That 
guy could hit falling out of bed." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not the best choice of words, eh, Lou? 
</P>
<P>
The result was on ice: The New Jersey Devils were leading the New York 
Islanders, 2-1, halfway through the third period last Saturday night. That they 
would end up losing, 3-2, in overtime, should have been obvious to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Reason? The Devils had won just once in 41 previous regular-season visits to 
the Nassau Coliseum since joining the NHL as the Kansas City Scouts in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Now they're 1 for 42. 
</P>
<P>
Design flaws?The following excerpts are from a press release announcing the 
opening of a new betting facility at Caliente Race Track in Tijuana: 
</P>
<P>
"Features include 100 private tables with lamps for one person . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The 99 others will have to bet on the dark horses, no doubt. 
</P>
<P>
And later, these two consecutive sentences: 
</P>
<P>
"It has 900 upholstered chairs. 'It can seat 3,000 people,' Hernandez said." 
</P>
<P>
What, sitting three to a chair? 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The three are more recognizable as Benoit Benjamin, Dominique 
Wilkins and Kelly Tripucka, but Lenard, Jacques and Peter are their real first 
names. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Syracuse basketball Coach Jim Boeheim after the loss to the Hoyas in 
the Big East title game: "I personally rated Georgetown first or second in the 
country all year long. But I don't know why I ever thought they were second. I 
must have temporarily lost my mind."

Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson is already in the record books. Now he 
and about 150 other people, places, things and events also have made it into 
the World Book Encyclopedia. Former Beatle Paul McCartney, comedian Bill Cosby, 
composer Andrew Lloyd Weber and Tyson are among those deemed worthy by editors 
for a permanent entry in this year's edition of the encyclopedia. "You can't be 
of temporary interest like British novelist Salman Rushdie, author of 'The 
Satanic Verses,' who may be news today but forgotten next year," Executive 
Editor A. Richard Harmet said. Also among this year's new entries, which can 
take up to three years each to prepare, are American writers David Mamet and 
Maya Angelou, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, British physicist 
Stephen Hawking, Lakers basketball star Magic Johnson and Chinese Premier Li 
Peng.

 -- Sen. Paul Simon lost his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
But he hopes his book, in which he offers blunt observations on his own 
campaign and those of his Democratic rivals, will be a winner. Simon writes 
that Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) came off as brash, Bruce Babbitt eventually 
became desperate, Gary Hart was a dull speaker and Michael S. Dukakis was too 
remote, a flaw fatal to his campaign, Simon writes in "Winners and Losers." In 
the book, Simon faults himself for some tactical errors and for failing to 
build his campaign around a "central theme" that would have been easily 
accessible to voters. Simon has written 11 other books, which have examined 
such topics as unemployment, hunger and foreign-language education. "We've had 
all kinds of people writing about what a campaign is like, but it's a little 
different when you're sitting in the chair of a candidate," he said.

SEVERAL S.D. COUNTY SCHOOLS PULL APPLES FROM STUDENT MENUS 
</P>

Several San Diego County elementary-school districts and one unified school 
district have stopped serving apples to their students after a recent report 
that a chemical sometimes applied to the fruit to delay ripening can cause 
cancer, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Union Elementary, Bonsall Union Elementary, Cajon Valley Union 
Elementary, Dehesa Elementary and Encinitas Union Elementary school districts 
all said they would take apples, apple sauce and apple juice off their school 
lunch menus until they receive assurances from suppliers or government agencies 
that the apples are safe to eat. 
</P>
<P>
"We are maintaining (apple juice) in storage. We are not serving it and we're 
not buying any more," said David H. West, superintendent of the Borrego Springs 
Unified School District, which has also put a hold on the fruit. "There seems 
to be some question about it, and we'll let somebody who knows more about it 
than we do give us some advice first." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fruit Pulled Elsewhere 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second-largest, and the San 
Francisco Unified School District stopped selling and serving apples last week. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, school officials stressed they were not banning the fruit, but 
were taking precautions until further information is available. Others said 
they had not been told by the U. S. Department of Agriculture, which runs a 
commodity program providing many schools with fruit, to take the fruit off the 
menus. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials said the public overreacted to last 
</P>
<P>
month's report by the nonprofit, Washington-based Natural Resources Defense 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
"We have secured documentation from our produce company . . . that all their 
apples come from orchards that do not use Alar," a brand name for the chemical 
daminozide used to control ripening, said Jane Boehrer, food services director 
for the San Diego Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Farm Bureau of San Diego County said Alar is used on 5% 
of the apple crop in the country, and that those apples are designated for 
export. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fear About Public Alarm 
</P>
<P>
"I understand the concern for food safety, and that the schools have a 
responsibility to get all the information they need for an educated decision . 
. . but we hope that this kind of action doesn't alarm the public into thinking 
fresh fruits and vegetables are not safe for consumption," said Farm Bureau 
spokeswoman Wendy Benz. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Beth Lang, a spokeswoman for the Washington state Department of Food and 
Agriculture, said that, "of 100 fresh apple samples that our department pulled 
from different Washington state growers, only seven showed any traces of Alar. 
The highest level we found was 1.4 parts per million, and the (Environmental 
Protection Agency) allows 20 parts per million." 
</P>
<P>
Washington state produces 40% of the nation's apples, Lang said. 
</P>
<P>
At Cajon Valley Union Elementary school district, Linda Patzold, director of 
child nutrition, said the commercial distributor who sells apples to the 
district had assured her that the growers they buy the fruit from do not use 
Alar. Nevertheless, she said she will await further testing results from the 
EPA, the state Department of Health Services and other government agencies.

ACLU WINS COURT ORDER TO PREVENT ABORTION BLOCKADE; 
</P>
<P>
FEDERAL JUDGE ACTS IN FACE OF THREATENED PROTEST ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hoping to thwart protests planned in San Diego this weekend by anti-abortion 
activists, ACLU officials have obtained a federal court order to prevent 
protesters from blockading medical clinics where abortions are performed. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, including 
those from San Diego and Imperial counties, said they obtained a statewide 
preliminary injunction from U. S. District Court Judge A. Wallace Tashima in 
Los Angeles on Monday. The action was in anticipation of anti-abortion protests 
targeted for one or more clinics in the San Diego area Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU officials said they will ask Tashima to levy fines of up to $10,000 
against any protester violating the injunction, said Betty Wheeler, legal 
director of the ACLU Foundation of San Diego and Imperial counties. 
</P>
<P>
"The ACLU of San Diego and Imperial counties is taking legal steps, in 
conjunction with the ACLU of Southern California, to make sure that all women 
in San Diego County will be able to exercise their constitutional right to 
reproductive choice . . .," Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Vigorously Pursue Proceedings' 
</P>
<P>
"The ACLU will vigorously pursue contempt proceedings against those persons who 
. . . deprive others of their constitutional rights," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the preliminary injunction, demonstrators will be barred from trespassing 
or forming blockades on the property of medical facilities that perform 
abortions and other family-planning services. They will also be banned from 
conducting so-called sidewalk counseling, which the clinics claim is a tactic 
to impede the movement of their patients. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's protest will be sponsored by Project Rescue in San Diego, a local 
branch of the national group called Operation Rescue. The national group gained 
widespread attention for its practice of forming human blockades to prevent 
women from entering clinics, as well as for its participants' willingness to go 
to jail for their cause. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Abortion Clinics Closed 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 Operation Rescue activists were responsible for closing two 
abortion clinics in Los Angeles in February, and another protest is scheduled 
there from March 22 to 25. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent such closures of San Diego clinics, ACLU officials said they decided 
to seek the court order to make sure women will not be barred from medical 
services this weekend, Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU chapters sought the order on behalf of medical providers such as 
Planned Parenthood and Womancare, Wheeler said. Other states have used such 
orders to ensure that women have full access to clinics, she said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego clinics are also planning to have volunteer guards on hand to escort 
women through protesters and into the medical offices, said Patricia O'Neil, 
associate director of Womancare. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the federal court order, Project Rescue officials have said they will 
continue their efforts to discourage women from obtaining abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to stop the slaughter of unborn babies from conception to birth, 
those participating in Project Rescue will passively, repentantly and 
peacefully block the entrances of abortion clinics with their bodies," San 
Diego organization leaders stated in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rescue Efforts 'Not Militant' 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Mick McCoy, pastor of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship of East San 
Diego County and one of the clerics involved in Project Rescue, said Tuesday 
that the group's efforts are "not militant." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a peaceful, nonviolent attempt to stop the murder of unborn children," he 
said, distinguishing his group from more militant anti-abortion activists. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy could not say if the preliminary injunction would prevent some 
anti-abortion activists, most of whom are Christians, from joining the protest 
Saturday. But he said it is a "shame" for those who want to protect an "unborn 
child from death to receive a criminal charge for that." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil of Womancare disputed the assertion that the blockades and sidewalk 
counseling against medical clinics have been peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
"Across the nation, it's not been anyone's experience that they are peaceful 
protesters," O'Neil said. "It's violence against women who are being publicly 
humiliated for a decision." 
</P>
<P>
Lenore Lowe, director of community affairs for Planned Parenthood of San Diego 
and Riverside counties, said it is a "miscalculation on the part of Operation 
Rescue organizers that the public will stand for such action. . . . Women 
resent someone else making this a public issue." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Hundred Expected 
</P>
<P>
Project Rescue organizers said they expect several hundred anti-abortion 
activists to attend a rally on Friday at the Youth for Christ Conference Center 
in Mission Valley, where the primary speaker will be Joe Schiedler, author of 
"99 Ways to Stop Abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Participants won't be informed of the targeted clinic or clinics until the next 
morning, said Rick Monroe, publisher of "Good News, Etc," a San Diego County 
Christian newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
According to Operation Rescue statistics, more than 22,000 protesters have been 
arrested in more than 20 cities in the United States during protests, most of 
whom have been released after a day or so in jail. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU officials, however, hope their federal injunction will "up the ante" and 
discourage the protesters from blocking entrances to the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
An Operation Rescue supporter said the large fines stemming from the court 
order won't make a difference to protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"It (protesting) was illegal before and it's still illegal now," said an 
assistant in the Operation Rescue office in Los Angeles who gave her first name 
as Angela. "Nobody pays the fine anyway. We'd rather do jail time than pay the 
fine," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But organizers for Project Rescue in San Diego say the goal of their protest 
"is not to be arrested, but to save women from being exploited . . . and to 
protect the life of the unborn," McCoy said. 
</P>
<P>
"If that means putting ourselves physically between the child and the 
abortionists, then so be it."

ANIMAL LOVER LEAVES $700,000 TO OCEANSIDE HUMANE SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than 50 years, furry cats, scraggly dogs and an assortment of 
abandoned, four-legged creatures have found an abundant supply of tender loving 
care at the Oceanside Humane Society. 
</P>
<P>
And now, a $700,000 gift from the estate of a Hollywood housekeeper will make 
sure the care gets even better at the society, which intends to use the gift to 
build a new shelter for the growing number of strays in North County. 
</P>
<P>
The gift comes from proceeds from the sale of a Beverly Hills cottage that 
belonged to Eileen Lamb, a lifelong animal lover. The cottage sold for $1.5 
million nearly two years ago, but the money remained frozen until recently, 
when Humane Society officials in Oceanside and Los Angeles settled a legal 
skirmish over the bequest. 
</P>
<P>
"The community has been very generous in the past, but I don't think we've 
gotten anything like this before," said Carl Morrison, a spokesman for the 
Oceanside society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans for New Shelter 
</P>
<P>
"We've had long-range plans to build a new shelter for quite some time, but we 
could never do it because we didn't have the money," Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
The $700,000 gift found its way to Oceanside Humane Society as a result of a 
fund-raising campaign two years ago. Letters appealing for revenue were sent to 
community residents and, luckily, one of the letters was delivered to William 
V. Berry, an Oceanside real estate agent and a friend of Lamb. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb worked as housekeeper for the late stage star Elsie Janis, who was known 
as the "sweetheart of the American Expeditionary Forces" as an entertainer of 
U. S. troops in France during World War I. Janis left her 1,800-square-foot 
cottage to Lamb when she died in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
In her will, Lamb said the house should be sold and the proceeds donated to the 
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals upon her death. She died June 
24, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Since Lamb's will did not name a particular branch of the SPCA, Berry -- who 
was in charge of selling the house -- thought the money go to the Oceanside 
Humane Society, which is recognized as a chapter of the SPCA. 
</P>
<P>
"She (Lamb) had been to the Oceanside Humane Society and had seen how clean and 
nice the facility was. She commented about how happy the dogs looked. They were 
wagging their tails, and they didn't look like they were in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"I remembered getting the letter from the Humane Society and that brought my 
attention to the needs of the facility," Berry said. "Since she liked the 
facility so much, I thought it would be nice to get some money for it. That's 
when I contacted the executor of the will." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
L.A. Branch Wanted Money 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles SPCA officials thought the money should be theirs. 
</P>
<P>
"The will was an ambiguous one that left the sale of the house to the SPCA," 
said Richard Marsh, the attorney who represented the Los Angeles organization. 
"It was our feeling that Eileen Lamb intended the money to go to the L.A. SPCA. 
The Oceanside Humane Society felt differently." 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two years, the two groups squabbled over which organization should 
receive the $1.5 million raised through the sale of the house. Finally, earlier 
this month, the two parties reached a settlement, deciding to split the sum. 
</P>
<P>
The Oceanside Humane Society is looking for a site for the shelter, Morrison 
said. When completed, it will be named after Lamb. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that someone will donate the land," Morrison said. "We'll 
probably need about 3 to 5 acres. It could be in Oceanside, or we might build 
it somewhere else in North County." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the society, which advocates humane treatment of animals and 
provides an adoption service for strays, is undergoing a $200,000 expansion of 
its existing facility. 
</P>
<P>
"We were able to do this expansion with the money we have received from the 
people in the community," Morrison said.

EX-SDSU STUDENT GETS 120 DAYS, PROBATION IN SEXUAL ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former San Diego State University student was sentenced Tuesday to 120 days 
in custody and five years' probation for the 1988 sexual assault of an SDSU 
student near campus. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Michael Healey, 22, pleaded guilty Dec. 6 to one count of sexual 
battery stemming from the assault on the woman on Feb. 11, 1988. The court 
recommended that Healey serve his sentence at the West Fork honor camp in East 
San Diego County and that his sentence begin after the current school semester 
is over. 
</P>
<P>
In passing sentence, Superior Court Judge Herbert J. Exarhos cited Healey's 
lack of premeditation and his lack of previous convictions as reasons for 
granting Healey's request for probation. 
</P>
<P>
During the preliminary hearing, the victim -- who went to high school with 
Healey -- testified that he met her at Winter's nightclub on El Cajon 
Boulevard. Later they left for her apartment, where he raped her. Attorneys on 
both sides of the case acknowledge that both parties were drunk at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Without the plea bargain, Healey could have been sentenced to a maximum of 36 
years if convicted on all the charges, which included rape with a foreign 
object and assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
Healey is now enrolled in an undisclosed school, after withdrawing from SDSU 
because of publicity about the case.

POWER FAILURE DELAYS AMTRAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amtrak's morning train from San Diego to Los Angeles arrived an hour and a half 
late Tuesday after a power outage caused the switches to fail between San Diego 
and San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Monte, Amtrak reservation sales agent, said the trains had to reduce speed 
to 20 m.p.h. for safety reasons, since the switches were not working. Trains 
normally travel 65 to 70 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The train was an hour and 50 minutes late in Santa Ana and an hour and 55 
minutes late in Fullerton. It arrived in Los Angeles at 9:30 a.m., an hour and 
a half late. 
</P>
<P>
The switches failed at 5:45 a.m. and were back in service at 8:40 a.m. Monte 
said one southbound train and one northbound train were affected.

COUNTY TO SEEK STATE GRANT FOR VEHICLE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved applying to the 
state for a $17.5-million grant to build an off-highway vehicle park in the 
Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The board made the request contingent upon the project satisfactorily passing 
environmental tests. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Disney Co. has warned that noise from the park in rugged Whitney Canyon 
would jeopardize filming at its nearby movie ranch. The environmental study is 
expected to be completed this summer. The earliest the facility could be opened 
is the summer of 1991, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Off-road enthusiasts have been lobbying for a place to ride since the only 
other park in the area, Indian Dunes Park, was closed in 1984.

'PANHANDLERS' SENT TO JAIL FOR STEALING WALLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man and a woman who posed as penniless travelers to obtain money from 
sympathetic Los Angeles area residents were sentenced to jail Tuesday for 
stealing a wallet containing $960 from a Reseda woman. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Dwayne Allman, 31, received a year in jail, while his companion, Tracy 
Chris Hartland, 24, was sentenced to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz placed the pair 
-- dubbed by authorities as the "Yuppie Panhandlers" -- on three years 
probation each and ordered them to make restitution to the victim, Anne Hitt, 
69. 
</P>
<P>
They are already serving jail terms imposed Feb. 24 by a Los Angeles Municipal 
Court commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities began calling Allman and Hartland the "Yuppie Panhandlers" after 
they were arrested and it was learned that they managed a West Hollywood 
apartment house. 
</P>
<P>
"They look like the boy and girl next door," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Phil 
Rabichow, the prosecutor in the wallet theft. 
</P>
<P>
After pleading guilty in Los Angeles Municipal Court, Allman was sentenced to 
15 months in jail and Hartland received nine months for conning more than 300 
people into handing over sums of money ranging from $10 to $100. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the couple claimed to be stranded travelers and to need the 
money for food or transportation home, when actually they were using it for 
drugs and living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Stoltz ruled that Tuesday's sentences be served concurrently with those in the 
Los Angeles case. 
</P>
<P>
In a preliminary hearing, Hitt, a bail bond agent, said she was approached by 
Allman as she stood outside a Reseda restaurant June 26. She said he told her 
that Hartland was his pregnant wife and that their car had been burglarized. He 
asked for $30 to help them return to Merced, Hitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Hitt said she offered Allman $10 and then, at his request, rummaged in her 
purse for more money. Allman grabbed the wallet and jumped into a waiting car 
driven by Hartland, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Hitt reported the theft after seeing Allman's picture on a television news 
report. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 31, Allman pleaded guilty in Van Nuys Superior Court to the grand theft 
charge and Hartland pleaded guilty to being an accessory to the theft. 
</P>

SNOW GOT THE 49ERS ROLLING IN A HURRY

Call it the Snow-ball effect. 
</P>
<P>
Few people in the college baseball community doubted that Dave Snow would 
improve the Cal State Long Beach baseball program when he left Loyola Marymount 
last June. 
</P>
<P>
No one, however, including Snow, believed the transformation would occur so 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, which was 15-45 last season under former Coach John Gonsalves, is 
22-2 and ranked fourth and sixth, respectively, in this week's Collegiate 
Baseball-ESPN and Baseball America polls. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers' only losses are a 4-1 defeat against Loyola on March 5 and a 3-2 
setback at Arizona State Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone beyond even my expectations," Snow said. "But anytime you play, 
you've got an opportunity and, basically, we've just capitalized." 
</P>
<P>
Snow, 38, has a history of engineering turnarounds. 
</P>
<P>
After playing for Augie Garrido at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and serving as an 
assistant under Garrido at Cal State Fullerton from 1973-77, Snow took over a 
beleaguered program at Valley College in 1978 and won four Metropolitan 
Conference titles and a state community college championship in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Snow returned to Fullerton as an assistant in 1983, then replaced Marv Wood at 
Loyola in the summer of 1984 after the Lions endured an 11-41 season. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Snow led Loyola to a 50-15 record, a share of the West Coast Athletic 
Conference title and into the College World Series. Last season, Loyola was 
48-18, losing to Oklahoma State in the Midwest Regional. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the experiences I've had at other places, I had a pretty good game 
plan when I came in here," said Snow, who compiled a 161-81-1 record in four 
seasons at Loyola. "I'm just fortunate that in June there were still some 
pretty good players out there." 
</P>
<P>
Kyle Abbott, a junior left-hander who played at Mission Viejo High and 
transferred to Long Beach from UC San Diego, is 7-0 with a 1.82 earned-run 
average and has 45 strikeouts in 50 innings. Abbott leads a staff that has 
compiled a 2.59 ERA under pitching coach Wally Kincaid, who retired as a head 
coach in 1980 with a record of 675-162 in 22 seasons at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Darrell Sherman, a junior transfer from Cerritos, is batting 
.425 with one home run, 20 runs batted in and 14 stolen bases. Deryk Hudson, a 
junior third baseman-designated hitter from Fullerton College, is batting .292 
with a team leading five home runs and 29 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers are also getting production from returning players such as senior 
second baseman Chris Gill, who is batting .387 with one home run and 19 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, they've been a pretty hungry group," Snow said of his players. "They 
wanted to put this place on the map." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach does not open play in the Big West Conference until March 31 but 
there will be no surprise element going for the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got an identity now," Snow said. "They're going to be loaded up and 
ready for us." 
</P>
<P>
A cut above: USC pitcher Randy Powers almost lost part of the ring finger on 
his right hand in a construction accident last summer. But Powers, a junior 
right-hander from Azusa, doesn't seem to have lost his control. 
</P>
<P>
Powers scattered three hits, had seven strikeouts and did not walk a batter in 
shutting out UCLA, 6-0, last Friday night in a Pacific 10 Southern Division 
game. The victory improved Powers' record to 5-0 and lowered his ERA to 2.15. 
He has issued seven walks in 50 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"The finger feels fine and looks fine on the bottom," said Powers, who won his 
first seven starts last season before tearing a muscle in his elbow and 
finishing 11-5. "But on top, where the fingernail is, it looks pretty bad." 
</P>
<P>
Powers, who does not have a full scholarship, was loading metal brackets onto a 
truck last August when a glove he was wearing caught on a nail and a brace fell 
on his finger. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing holding (the finger) on was the nerve, which stretched more 
than an inch," Powers said. "It was more numb than anything else. I didn't 
think about losing the finger until a doctor said that was a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Powers underwent 2 1/2 hours of surgery to repair the damage and a wire pin was 
inserted in his knuckle. 
</P>
<P>
"I took 15 painkillers a day for the first few days," he said. "It's amazing 
how one little part of your body can cause so much pain to the rest of it." 
</P>
<P>
Powers will start Friday in the opener of a three-game conference series at 
Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
For openers: Pepperdine and Loyola, playing under first-year coaches Andy Lopez 
and Chris Smith, respectively, will open their WCAC schedules Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine, the defending WCAC champion, travels to Santa Clara for a four-game 
series and Loyola, which finished fourth in the WCAC last season, travels to 
the University of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez won two California Collegiate Athletic Assn. titles in six seasons at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills before replacing Dave Gorrie, who retired after winning 
or sharing five conference titles in 10 years at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was an assistant at Loyola and also worked as a scout and instructor for 
the New York Yankees before he replaced Dave Snow. 
</P>
<P>

NEWSWIRE: KENTLING RESIGNING AS MISL'S COMMISSIONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Kentling, the third commissioner in the Major Indoor Soccer League's 
11-year history, announced his resignation Tuesday, effective at the end of his 
current contract May 31. 
</P>
<P>
Despite widespread rumors that he was forced out by league owners, Kentling 
maintained until as late as this week that the decision whether to resign was 
solely his. 
</P>
<P>
Kentling, who was appointed on June 1, 1986, said he resigned because owners 
who weren't in the league when he took over should have the opportunity to 
choose their own man. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Fowler, the Sockers' owner, said a committee headed by Baltimore Blast 
Owner Stuart Weitzman and including Socker President Ron Cady would likely name 
a successor to Kentling in the next 30 days.

RELEAGUING LIKELY TO SEND AGOURA TO MARMONTE LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to move Agoura High to the Marmonte League is expected to be 
approved Friday when schools from the Northern Area of the Southern Section 
meet to select their final releaguing plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers would rejoin the Marmonte League after nine years in the Frontier 
League. The move would increase Marmonte membership to eight schools and reduce 
the Frontier's to five. Northern Area schools will select one of several 
proposals to reorganize leagues in the area for the 1990-91 and 1991-92 school 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a logical move for Agoura to join the Marmonte League," Westlake 
Athletic Director Bob Fisher said. "They're bigger than Newbury Park or 
Westlake. They're near the Conejo Valley and they're kind of a natural rival. I 
think it will help gate receipts." 
</P>
<P>
Agoura Athletic Director Fred Williams would welcome a departure from the 
Frontier League but doubts that his school can compete successfully in the 
Marmonte League. 
</P>
<P>
"We might be able to compete in some sports but not with their overall 
programs," Williams said. "We don't have the student body to compete with 
schools like Channel Islands." 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands, the largest school in the league, has an enrollment of more 
than 2,500. Three-year schools Simi Valley and Royal have 2,250 and 1,950 
students, respectively. Agoura has an enrollment of about 1,850. Reflecting on 
the two years Agoura competed in the Marmonte League, Williams said: "My 
baseball team finished 0-14 in 1978." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, however, have outgrown the Frontier League, in which enrollment 
of members other than Agoura is 750 to 1,100. Agoura won 11 of 16 league 
championships last school year. "We don't belong in the Frontier League, 
either," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams proposed the formation of a new league consisting of the smaller teams 
from the Channel and Marmonte. 
</P>
<P>
The new league -- nicknamed the 101 League in reference to the freeway that 
provides access to the member schools -- would consist of Agoura, Camarillo, 
Newbury Park, Rio Mesa and Westlake. Williams' plan also would leave the 
Channel, Marmonte, Frontier and Tri-Valley leagues with five teams each. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard would join Channel Islands, Royal, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks to form 
a five-team Marmonte League. Buena, Hueneme, San Marcos, Santa Barbara and 
Ventura would remain in the Channel League, and Fillmore would move from the 
Tri-Valley to the Frontier League. 
</P>
<P>
Williams doubts that his proposal will succeed but is certain Agoura will be 
moved. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a 95% chance that we will leave the Frontier League and a 75% 
chance we will go to the Marmonte League as it exists," he said.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
THOUGH ROYAL'S JONES HIT A BATTER, HIS PITCHES ALL PROVED UNHITTABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Jones of Royal High came within one inside fastball of a perfect game in 
Monday's no-hitter against St. Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders won, 5-0, behind 13 strikeouts by Jones, who made only 79 
pitches -- 53 were strikes -- in the seven-inning game at Marine Field in Santa 
Monica. The one that got away was a fastball that hit a St. Monica batter with 
one out in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Jones pitched so well that, of the 13 strikeouts, 10 were in situations in 
which the batter was caught looking. 
</P>
<P>
"His fastball was really moving on the inside of the plate," Royal Coach Mike 
McCurdy said. "It was exciting. We needed that type of a game." 
</P>
<P>
Jones also had three hits in as many at-bats as Royal improved to 3-3. "He had 
a career in one night," McCurdy said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, Jones pitched Monday only because he was unable to last weekend 
when he was still feeling the effects of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
His eyes are on Texas: Gregg Zaun wouldn't be specific, but it's going to take 
quite an offer to lure the St. Francis catcher from the University of Texas. He 
already has orally committed to the Longhorns. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take a pretty good offer from a pro team to give that up," Zaun 
said. "The money I want you just don't see in somebody my size, and the draft 
is pretty much size-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
Zaun stands 5-foot-10 and weighs 165 pounds, which he figures is the perfect 
size for a Longhorn. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to go to Texas, anyway, and when I went there it was 
everything I expected and more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While in Austin a couple of weeks ago, he saw Texas beat UCLA twice. Zaun also 
was impressed with the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"The field was great and the fans were really into the game," Zaun said. 
"Longhorn sports are really popular." 
</P>
<P>
Taking offense: Chatsworth might have got out of the gate a little slowly, but 
the offense cannot be blamed for the Chancellors' 3-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
With a team batting average of .314 through five games, Chatsworth has 
outscored the opposition, 55-24, and has posted lopsided wins of 19-2 over 
Ventura, 13-5 over Rio Mesa and 12-2 over Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth, which finished third in the Blue Division of the Westside 
tournament, has had an eight-run inning, a 10-run inning and an 11-run inning. 
</P>
<P>
Against Rio Mesa, a grand slam by shortstop Jason Evans, coupled with a two-run 
home run by catcher Eric Johnson, highlighted an eight-run eighth inning that 
snapped a 5-5 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Against Hueneme, 13 batters came to the plate in the third inning as Chatsworth 
broke a scoreless tie with 10 runs. Senior Nick Schultz had a leadoff single 
and a three-run double in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Senior center fielder Kevin Chong is batting a team-high .562 (nine for 16) and 
Evans is batting .437 with two home runs and a team-high 11 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, Johnson and pitcher-first baseman Derek Wallace each have hit two home 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Strikeout leaders: A year ago as juniors, Roland De La Maza of St. Genevieve 
and Roger Salkeld of Saugus shared the Valley-area lead with 126 strikeouts. 
And the two right-handed starters are off to fast starts as seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld has 43 strikeouts and has not allowed an earned run through 23 innings. 
He has pitched three complete games -- a one-hitter with 13 strikeouts in a 6-0 
win over Gahr; a three-hitter with 19 strikeouts in nine innings against 
Crespi, a 1-1 tie called because of darkness; and a two-hitter and 11 
strikeouts in a 2-0 win against Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
After giving up three earned runs and losing in the season opener against 
Quartz Hill, De La Maza struck out 18 in nine innings last week and allowed 
eight hits (seven singles, one double). During one stretch, De La Maza struck 
out 13 of 14 batters. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy left-hander Denny Sharp showed signs of rivaling those two for 
strikeout honors. The 5-10 junior has 31 strikeouts in 15 innings, including 14 
in a 22-2 win over Camarillo on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Belt-high fastball: Taft catcher Adam Zutler launched what some observers 
claimed was a 450-foot home run Saturday against Santa Monica. But that's 
stretching the tape measure, according to Coach Rich McKeon. "Four-fifteen was 
more like it," he said. "But it was up high and it went far." 
</P>
<P>
Master thieves: St. Genevieve (2-1) has stolen 22 bases in 26 attempts, but 
Coach Kevin Kane does not attribute such success to blazing speed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like we're the St. Louis Cardinals," he said. "But because we're a 
young team, I've taught the kids to be really aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
Advancing to second base on a walk, going from second to third on a wild-pitch 
strikeout and converting double steals are examples of the Valiants' attacking 
style. Stealing home is about the only thing St. Genevieve hasn't accomplished 
on the base paths, but Kane says he is working on that. 
</P>
<P>
"The opportunity just hasn't presented itself yet," he said. "But when it does, 
we'll probably try it." 
</P>
<P>
No field, no pitch: Chaminade, which began the week 0-5, could be the most 
disappointing team in the Valley. Coach Steve Costley says that there is no 
mystery to the Eagles' woes. 
</P>
<P>
"I can sum it up in two words," he said. "Errors and walks." 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade has committed 23 errors and the Eagle pitching staff has walked 37 
batters. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been terrible," Costley said. "And I don't understand why. We're fine in 
practice, but then we go to pieces in the games. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't hit too many more ground balls in practice. I've got blisters all over 
my hands as it is." 
</P>
<P>
Add Chaminade: The Eagles' poor fielding has hurt left-handed pitcher Chris 
DeCristo as much as anyone. DeCristo, a senior, has an 0-3 record despite a 
2.92 earned-run-average. In 12 innings, he has allowed 20 runs, five of them 
earned.

DIGEST: DUNLAP EXPECTS PROMOTION AT THOUSAND OAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Dunlap, an assistant for the Thousand Oaks High cross-country program, said 
earlier this week that he expects to replace Jack Farrell as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell, citing a desire to devote more time to his family and other endeavors, 
announced his retirement from coaching last week. 
</P>
<P>
In 14 seasons, Farrell guided Thousand Oaks to three Southern Section 4-A 
Division boys' titles and two runner-up finishes. His girls' teams placed 
second twice. 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap, 26, who assisted Farrell last season, said that he was assured the job 
by Thousand Oaks Athletic Director Dale Ackerman pending Farrell's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically just a matter of me filling out the paper work," said Dunlap, a 
1980 graduate of Thousand Oaks who won consecutive Ventura County and Marmonte 
League cross-country titles in 1978 and '79. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Burnham of Rio Mesa High won the 200-meter dash at the National 
Scholastic Indoor track and field championships in Annapolis, Md., on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham, the defending state champion in the 100 and 200 meters, clocked 24.80 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon sophomore Dave Hartman placed fifth in the boys' two-mile run with a 
personal best of nine minutes, 26.95 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Harrison, baseball coach at The Master's College, has been named manager of 
the Alaska Goldpanners, a semipro team that competes in the Alaska Summer 
League. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, 42, in his second season at Master's, will remain with the school. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Gattis of Woodland Hills, an assistant baseball coach at Pepperdine from 
1985-88, has been named manager of the Miami Miracle, a co-op team affiliated 
with the Cleveland Indians in the Class-A Florida State League. 
</P>
<P>
Gattis, 36, has previous professional coaching experience. In 1983, Gattis 
helped lead the Utica Blue Sox to the New York-Penn League title He also 
managed the Salt Lake City Trappers in the Pioneer Rookie League in 1985 and 
1986.

DAVE DISTEL: THEY HIT IT OFF OVER MUTUAL INTEREST IN HITTING IT OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spring training interviews can be tedious and repetitive and often become 
exercises in cliches formulated by Connie Mack and passed through generations 
of managers and players. 
</P>
<P>
Jack McKeon was in the midst of one of those "talking head" television 
conversations a few days ago when the sportscaster triggered a nerve. 
</P>
<P>
The subject was catchers, and just what a pleasant predicament the Padres were 
in because they have two such outstanding young catchers in Benito Santiago and 
Sandy Alomar Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The stock answer is that it is, indeed, a pleasant problem, having two such 
fine young men. 
</P>
<P>
It was not McKeon's answer. 
</P>
<P>
"Two outstanding young catchers?" he blustered. "Are you kidding? We have three 
outstanding young catchers." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the next few minutes were spent discussing Mark Parent, this spring's 
outsider who is in reality an insider. It can be etched in any of the boulders 
strewn on this moonscape that Parent will be on the roster opening day, and 
Alomar will not. 
</P>
<P>
However, for much of spring training, Parent has been anonymous and seemingly 
forgotten . . . except maybe by Jack Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Parent, the 27-year-old backup catcher, and Jack Clark, the 33-year-old 
superstar first baseman, have forged an unlikely relationship. They are the 
Crunch Buddies, who spend hours talking about hitting and then go out and pound 
baseballs into the desert sands. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, of course, is known for his power. He has 256 career homers, including 
season highs of 25, 26, 27, 35 and 27. For Clark, six home runs in a month 
would be more typical than exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
Parent has six home runs in his career, all of them last year when he backed up 
Santiago and spent his first full season in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
What was significant about those six home runs was that they came in only 119 
at-bats. That figured to one home run for every 19.8 times at-bats. Parent had 
the lowest home run-to-at-bat ratio on the club. 
</P>
<P>
So what we have here, in essence, is the two most powerful Padre hitters 
talking baseball, one a star and the other an understudy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's baseball season," Parent said. "What else is there to talk about?" 
</P>
<P>
But you won't find these guys talking about the intricacies of infield play or 
how to align the outfield or the execution of the hit-and-run or how many miles 
pitchers should run between starts. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk just hitting," Parent said. "We can talk for hours and hours." 
</P>
<P>
Parent came back from yet another season of winter ball this spring and found 
his locker next to Clark's at the Padres' Yuma training complex. He had a few 
questions for his new teammate, not that he really knew what to expect in terms 
of answers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times you ask people for help, and they say, 'You're all right,' and 
go on their way," he said. "I ask Jack, and what he has to say might be brutal, 
but he'll tell me. I respect a guy like that." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, for his part, found it refreshing to find a youngster so receptive to 
learning. If Parent had been bashful about asking for advice, Clark might well 
have been bashful about offering. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to see somebody doing something wrong," he said, "but I'm not 
very pushy either." 
</P>
<P>
And so it was that the geography of a clubhouse created a common ground for a 
common interest . . . the bashing of baseballs. They would sit in front of 
those lockers gripping bats and cocking their wrists and occasionally jumping 
to their feet and getting into stances. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him he shouldn't try to hit like me," Clark said, "because I'm an 
awkward hitter." 
</P>
<P>
That being case, Clark should probably be giving awkward lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of repetition," Parent said. "We talk a lot about the mental 
side of the game, what to think about when you're ahead in the count and how to 
approach it when you're behind in the count. Sometimes we talk for a half an 
hour and end up back where we started." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the conversation, Parent said, is reinforcement of and expansion on 
things he has been told by Amos Otis, the hitting coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Amos," Parent said, "just can't be out there in the clubhouse talking to 
everyone all the time." 
</P>
<P>
But Jack Clark's locker is right there. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't teach yourself when you're doing something the wrong way," 
Clark said, "because you can't adjust what you often can't see. And talking to 
Mark helps me too, because it helps me think about hitting and what I should be 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
These Crunch Buddies were in the same group at a morning workout at Scottsdale 
Community College, and it seemed the air must have been lighter or the fences 
closer or the bats made of atomic wood. They put on a fireworks show of their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Flannery, coming to bat with the next group, stepped to the plate and 
called to the batting practice pitcher: "Hey, throw me some of the same 
baseballs those guys were using." 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
They were gone.

PAIR OF USD TEAMS COURTING NATIONAL PROMINENCE IN TENNIS;

<P>
BONUS SEASON FOR LARKING HELPS WOMEN 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jennifer Larking's University of San Diego tennis career ended last May at the 
NCAA championships. At least, that was the way it seemed to her and everyone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the former San Diego Section singles champion from Poway High then 
gave away all but one of her racquets and didn't pick up the remaining one for 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
Her eligibility had seemingly been exhausted, and she was expected to graduate 
in December with a degree in business administration and marry Steve Dawson on 
March 4. But things changed in December -- both marriage and graduation were 
postponed to late spring -- when the NCAA granted her another year of 
eligibility because of the circumstances of her transfer from the University of 
Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, when the national rankings were released Tuesday, Larking was 
ranked 36th (up from 38th at the end of last season) in singles. USD was ranked 
16th, the first time in the school's history that women's tennis has made the 
top 20. 
</P>
<P>
USD (12-4) already has defeated three top 20 teams -- Pepperdine (No. 9), 
Trinity (15) and SDSU (18). Its only losses were to third-ranked UCLA, 
10th-ranked Arizona State, 11th-ranked BYU and Pepperdine. USD's goal is to 
make it to the 16-team draw for NCAA championships. 
</P>
<P>
Much of this is happening because Larking is now in a senior season she thought 
she already had experienced. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of USD Coach Sherri Stephens, an NCAA committee granted her a 
"hardship" year because of the situation at Oklahoma. While she was a freshman 
at Oklahoma in the fall of 1984, Larking and three other women's tennis players 
quit after alleging misconduct on the part of a coach. Larking was released 
from her scholarship and transfered to USD, where she was allowed to play 
immediately and compiled 56-12 record over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
She did not know until late 1988 that she would have a fourth year coming. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know they were trying to get my year back," she said. "When they 
told me, my initial reaction was excitement. But then I thought about 
everything else. I wasn't sure if I wanted to come back. I wasn't sure if I 
could. I stopped playing after the nationals. And I didn't play at all until I 
got my eligibility back." 
</P>
<P>
Said Stephens: "Jennifer is a great player. Probably the best player I've had 
in all my years of coaching. She had to make the decision whether she wanted to 
put herself back on the line. She had had a great career. She was supposed to 
be getting married. She could have graduated. It was not an easy decision for 
her to make. I think she did it mostly for the team." 
</P>
<P>
After getting the OK from the NCAA and her fiance, Larking began concentrating 
on tennis again. 
</P>
<P>
She has had a lot of fun. And the team is enjoying what could be its best 
season ever. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 28, Larking won her No. 1 singles match in three sets (7-5, 2-6, 6-2) 
to lead the Toreras to a 5-4 victory over 18th-ranked San Diego State. 
Larking's singles record is 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
Just as nobody thought Larking would be playing, nobody four years ago would 
have envisioned USD among the elite. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a couple of top players, and that's it," said Kelley Jewell, the senior 
captain from Tucson, Ariz., who has been with Stephens for eight years through 
high school and college. "Now we're strong from top to bottom." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, USD finished 4-26. It was Stephens' first season after coaching high 
school in Tucson and serving as an assistant at the University of Arizona. Each 
year since has brought improvement, with the 1988 team finishing 15-9, 
including victories over two Top 20 teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was going to take a while," Stephens said. "I had nothing to 
promote. Now I feel I have something to sell. I'm very proud of that. And it 
helps in our recruiting and fund raising. It just snowballs. I just hope it 
keeps snowballing up." 
</P>
<P>
Stephens added, "It's basically recruiting that certain kind of player. These 
girls are really close. I really believe in the team aspect. I recruit a 
person, not a player." 
</P>
<P>
With limited scholarships and a relatively meager budget, she has recruited a 
terrific blend of age, style and abilities. 
</P>
<P>
The two other seniors are Jill Greenwood from Malibu and Nicole LaChiusa from 
Beaumont, Tex. Greenwood, a semifinalist at the 1987 West Coast Athletic 
Conference championships, has compiled a 22-13 doubles record over two years. 
LaChiusa was USD's most valuable player her freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Aby Brayton (San Jose) plays No. 3 singles and teams with Larking in No. 
1 doubles. Another junior, Christy Drage, was the 1985 San Diego Section 
singles champion at Mission Bay High. 
</P>
<P>
In the sophomore class are Tonya Fuller from San Jose (11-4 record in No. 2 
singles), Stephanie Hogue (Bellaire, Tex.) and Hillary Hobel (Palos Verdes). 
</P>
<P>
Enjoying exceptional freshman seasons are Sakolwan Kacharoen and Christine 
Schmeidel. 
</P>
<P>
Kacharoen came to the United States from Bangkok, Thailand, as a 14-year-old 
after winning the international Sport Goofy tournament at Disney World in 
Florida. Living with a guardian in Malibu, she was valedictorian of her senior 
class at Colin McWen High and is 13-5 in No. 4 singles for USD. Schmeidel, of 
Valencia, has USD's best record (13-2) playing No. 5 singles. She also was a 
finalist at last year's Fiesta Bowl Tennis Championships. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like our depth," said Stephens. "I really believe I could switch any 
one of them on any given day, and we'd be just as strong." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, with Larking back, USD is even stronger.

MURAL'S HANDS SCRIBBLE MESSAGE TO SAN DIEGO

<TEXT>
<P>
An innovative developer and two activist artists have teamed up to produce a 
towering and thought-provoking mural that gently questions the city's 
unofficial nickname. 
</P>
<P>
In the mural, a black hand wields an ink pen to fill in the outlined letters 
that spell "America's Finest City" at the top of a newspaper. Below it, a brown 
hand paints the flesh tones on one side of a man's face, while an Asian hand 
holds a chisel, ready to chip out the features from the stony planes of the 
face's other side. 
</P>
<P>
The 100-by-70-foot mural, which now ranks as the city's largest, was 
commissioned by developer Chris Mortenson, who advised San Diego artists 
Kathleen King and David Naton to design a painting "to grab people, to make 
people think." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that developers usually "do things safe," Mortenson said, "I just 
think that a mural of that size and in that location is making a statement 
anyway, a statement to art in the downtown area and its need. 
</P>
<P>
"We often pat ourselves on the back about being America's finest city, but we 
often have a lot of shortcomings. If we work hard, maybe it will be America's 
finest city in the year 2050." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper mural is painted on the north side of the renovated Arte 
building, at 6th Avenue and C Street, and carries a date of March 27, 2050, the 
200th anniversary of San Diego's incorporation, the artists say. 
</P>
<P>
Mortenson, George Feher and New Zealander Brian Stebbins of Rockford 
International Ltd. have recently renovated the 70-year-old building that has 
60,000 square feet of leasable space. 
</P>
<P>
Mortenson is an aggressive developer in the Gaslamp Quarter district, known for 
such projects as the Golden Lion Tavern and Exchange Building at 4th Avenue and 
F Street. He said the mural cost about $30,000 and considers it a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
"Other people say, '$30,000? Spend it on carpet,' " Mortenson said. "I consider 
it a bargain. Art enriches the environment. It makes a rather typical building 
special, along with some of the (architectural enhancements) we've done on the 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
Mortenson wanted a photo-realistic mural from a local artist. He chose King, a 
self-taught painter, after viewing a historic mural of Pacific Beach, circa 
1941, that she completed in August at Cass Street and Garnet Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
King and Naton met during the Pacific Beach mural project and formed Raw Art, a 
design partnership. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Mortenson) wanted us to come up with what we thought was suitable for a 
space in the middle of the financial district downtown," King said. To meet 
Mortenson's objectives, she and Naton developed a huge, realistic-looking 
newspaper, titled America's Finest City, a reference to San Diego's unofficial 
nickname. 
</P>
<P>
"It's supposed to be any newspaper," said King who incorporated type faces from 
several local newspapers. "It's saying the future is news. San Diego is writing 
its own news, its own future." 
</P>
<P>
This futuristic San Diego newspaper lists its circulation at 2,018,301 daily 
and 3,018,301 "Summer," in recognition of the city's population growth and its 
growth as a resort and tourist destination. 
</P>
<P>
The top right-hand corner of the newspaper's front page is folded back, 
revealing cryptic words and phrases from such inside stories as "shared 
responsibility," openness to growth, "culture," the visual and performing arts, 
impact, youth, fighting for neighborhoods, "questioning," "options" and pride. 
</P>
<P>
"It's words to spark peoples' thoughts," King said. "We want to get people to 
think in those terms and also wanted to be positive and upbeat and forward 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"It's supposed to target what issue is really important to you. Not everyone 
can be active on everything. We wanted to remind you that thinking about a 
problem isn't enough. You have to go and do something about it. If you're 
concerned about your neighborhood, do something. If you're worried about 
growth, open space and the beauty of the environment, just thinking about it 
isn't enough because this world has a way of making decisions for you if you 
don't decide for yourself." 
</P>
<P>
The key to San Diego's truly becoming America's finest city, the artists 
believe is the involvement of all people, hence the mural's ethnic diversity. 
They point out that even the man whose face is being rendered has a combination 
of "European" and native American features. 
</P>
<P>
King and Naton spent five sometimes hazardous months, from October through 
February, standing on a 30-inch-wide, wind-whipped platform, bouncing against 
the side of the building, often seven stories above the ground. King did most 
of the painting, including the hands and face. 
</P>
<P>
Naton did the drafting and scale drawing and painted the "sculptural and 
mechanical things." He took the duties of navigating the 24-foot-long painting 
platform. 
</P>
<P>
"I likened it to standing on a boat at a dock, with waves coming in, and 
painting the canvas, which is on the dock," Naton said. "With every little 
move, the entire thing would move." 
</P>
<P>
The wind posed a hazard almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
"It would come blowing up 6th Avenue about 1 p.m. and blow us 3 feet off the 
wall," King said. During Santa Anas, the wind was so treacherous the pair 
occasionally had to wait it out. 
</P>
<P>
They worked from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Cold days demanded that they bundle up in 
layers of clothes, including thermal underwear, jackets and gloves. 
</P>
<P>
The mural was too large to project on the wall. King and Naton used a grid 
technique, working from a scale model they carried on the platform. But to get 
a perspective on each element as it was painted, they had to return to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we would come down and be very disappointed," King said. "You just 
can't see when you can't lean back more than 3 feet from the wall. Letters 
particularly would get cockeyed. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember once the workers over at Symphony Towers were all waving their hats 
and applauding, and I knew it was OK. We had done a good job." 
</P>
<P>
King and Naton signed the newspaper mural on Feb. 27. They hope others will get 
something from it, encouragement "to pick up your particular tool. Obviously it 
is to show that artists of this community can be a very substantial part of the 
growth and development, the 'culturalization' of the city," King said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people are trying very hard to bring culture to San Diego," she added. 
"You don't have to bring it. Culture is here."

YOUNIS IS FOUND GUILTY OF AIR PIRACY, HOSTAGE-TAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a key test of new U.S. counterterrorism law, Lebanese militiaman Fawaz 
Younis was found guilty Tuesday of air piracy and hostage-taking in the June, 
1985, hijacking of Royal Jordanian Airlines Flight 402. 
</P>
<P>
Younis was convicted of three of six charges in the hijacking by a federal 
court jury after 2 1/2 days of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials called the verdict an affirmation of the U.S. legal 
provisions enacted in 1984 and 1986 that provided for apprehension of terrorism 
suspects outside the United States for trial here. 
</P>
<P>
The case proves "the determination of the U.S. government to bring to justice 
in the United States international terrorists who victimize innocent U.S. 
citizens wherever violence and hostage-taking acts are committed," said U.S. 
Atty. Jay B. Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
Two Americans were aboard the aircraft, which was blown up by the hijackers 
after the hostages and crew were released. 
</P>
<P>
However, some counterterrorism experts said that Younis' acquittal on three 
charges was clearly a setback for the government, particularly in light of the 
fact that Younis admitted that he had led four colleagues in the 30-hour 
hijacking. 
</P>
<P>
"The case was flawed from the beginning as we didn't have the John Dillinger of 
international terrorism on trial here," said Neil C. Livingstone, adjunct 
professor of national security at Georgetown University. "We had a relatively 
small fish with a rather fuzzy case against him." 
</P>
<P>
Younis, 30, showed little emotion when the verdict was read. He faces up to 
life imprisonment on the charge of seizing hostages. The two other charges on 
which he was convicted, conspiracy to commit air piracy and hijacking a 
commercial airliner, provide for maximum penalties of five and 20 years 
respectively. He is to be sentenced in 30 to 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
The jury acquitted the Lebanese national on charges of using or threatening 
violence against airliner passengers, destroying a civilian aircraft and 
carrying destructive devices aboard an aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Court-appointed defense attorney Francis D. Carter said that he plans to appeal 
the verdict on several grounds, including that the law is invalid. He called 
the case "ridiculous. Younis has no business being here. 
</P>
<P>
"This case wasn't about the United States. The plane wasn't brought to the 
United States. And the Americans on board were in no way harmed. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't worth the time and trouble the government put into it," he said. 
"And obviously the U.S. went through a lot of expense and effort to get him 
here. I believe they wanted a show trial, and they got their show trial." 
</P>
<P>
The defense largely centered its case on the anarchy in Lebanon at the time 
Younis and his colleagues seized the Jordanian airliner in Beirut and held 70 
passengers and crewmen hostage. Younis testified that he was a member of 
Lebanon's Amal militia, which was in a state of war with other factions in the 
nation, and that he acted on an order from a military commander. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution argued that hijacking a commercial airliner was clearly illegal 
and that the Jordanian airline and passengers were not involved in the war. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict was "a boost for our efforts to effectively deal with international 
terrorism," Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said in a statement. "Those who violate 
the rights of U.S. citizens are hereby put on notice that the American law 
enforcement system is capable of exacting a penalty for these terroristic 
crimes, regardless of where they occur." 
</P>
<P>
The Younis case was the first based on the new counterterrorism law. Younis was 
captured in 1987 by federal agents who lured him aboard a yacht in 
international waters off Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the case estimate that the cost of the elaborate 
military-style operation to lure Younis from Lebanon, the charter planes used 
to ferry him between a New York prison and the Washington courthouse and the 
extensive legal preparation for the high-priority prosecution cost the 
government in excess of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Risked the Principle' 
</P>
<P>
"We went for an easy rather than an obvious or more deserving figure," said 
Livingstone of Georgetown University. "We hung it all on this one guy and 
risked the whole principle." 
</P>
<P>
Added Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism specialist at Santa Monica-based RAND Corp.: 
"No one expects this conviction will stop terrorism or attacks on Americans 
abroad. Terrorists will not cower and fear because of this verdict." 
</P>
<P>
But he added that the conviction on the three charges may help preempt 
government discussion of military options as the most viable way to combat 
international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome "means we will not have to stoop to the terrorists' level. This 
puts us on a higher moral plane. Americans should take satisfaction in this, 
and it will also appeal to the international community," Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
Without a conviction, the recent laws and the right of "extraterritorial 
apprehension would have been stopped dead in their tracks," Livingstone 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
The case has been at the center of a major dispute among U.S. intelligence and 
counterterrorism officials. Several argued before Younis' abduction in 1987 
that he should not be the first target. They pointed out that no one was killed 
during the comparatively brief hijacking and that Amal was one of the few 
Lebanese militias that has had cordial relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligence officials particularly favored trying to apprehend someone from 
Hezbollah, or the Party of God, which has been linked to suicide bombings, 
hijackings that led to deaths, and prolonged hostage situations. However, 
counterterrorism officials decided that Younis might be a successful target.

ISRAEL MAY HAVE TO TALK TO PLO, BAKER DECLARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, hinting at a dramatic reversal of 
American policy, said Tuesday that there may be no realistic way to make peace 
in the Middle East unless Israel negotiates directly with the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
In an appearance before a House Appropriations subcommittee, Baker said that 
the Bush Administration ultimately may conclude that the PLO is so popular 
among Palestinian residents of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip 
that peace talks would be impossible without including the organization. Israel 
steadfastly refuses to recognize the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, who is visiting Washington, immediately 
reaffirmed Israel's refusal to deal in any way with the PLO, an organization 
that he said is guilty of the "worst atrocities we've ever seen since World War 
II." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It May Be That You Can't' 
</P>
<P>
But, declared Baker: "If you can't have direct negotiations that are meaningful 
that do not involve negotiations with the PLO . . . we would then have to see 
negotiations between Israelis and representatives of the PLO. It may be that 
you can have meaningful negotiations that don't involve the PLO; it may be that 
you can't." 
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, the U.S. government has joined Israel in excluding the 
PLO from the Middle East peace process. For instance, former Secretary of State 
George P. Shultz maintained that Palestinians could be represented in 
negotiations only as part of a joint delegation led by Jordan. Although Shultz 
agreed late last year to launch an unprecedented U.S. dialogue with the PLO -- 
after its chairman, Yasser Arafat, renounced the use of terrorism -- he never 
suggested that Israel might have to deal with the organization directly. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the PLO for many years refused even to consider peaceful 
negotiations with Israel. However, Arafat said recently that his organization 
is ready for such talks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Follow Arens-Bush Talks 
</P>
<P>
Baker's comments, apparently intended both to warn Israeli hard-liners that 
they can no longer take for granted U.S. support for their policy of isolating 
the PLO and to strengthen moderation among Palestinians, came less than 24 
hours after Arens conferred with President Bush, Baker, Vice President Dan 
Quayle and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. The Israeli foreign 
minister said that the U.S. officials made no such suggestion in their 
face-to-face meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"None of them urged Israel to talk to the PLO," Arens said Tuesday in answer to 
a question after a speech to the pro-Israel Washington Institute for Near East 
Policy. "We need peace more than anybody else and we don't need to be urged," 
Arens said. "But we need (negotiating) partners." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel is following a three-track approach to negotiations that 
calls for encouraging Jordan's King Hussein to come to the table, identifying 
"legitimate interlocutors" among Palestinian residents of the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip and bringing any other Arab state into the process. 
</P>
<P>
He conceded that Hussein and virtually all prominent Palestinians refuse to 
enter negotiations with Israel and argue that Israel should, instead, talk to 
the PLO. But he said that this is because of PLO intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
"The PLO wants to impose itself as a negotiating partner," Arens said. But he 
said the Israeli government is determined not to "give the PLO that 
recognition" because to do so would be to encourage terrorism, undermine 
Hussein's rule in Jordan and cause dissension in the Arab population of Israel 
proper. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Arens obliquely conceded the PLO's popularity with West Bank 
residents when he said of municipal elections in the West Bank in 1976 that 
"nobody ever maintained that they were not free or fair." PLO-backed candidates 
won almost every contest in 1976. The Israeli military government canceled 
subsequent elections because, Israeli officers said, the PLO was certain to win 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Matthew F. McHugh (D-N.Y.) told Baker during the House subcommittee 
hearing that although he wished it were not so, he knows of no legitimate 
Palestinian leadership outside the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We May Conclude That' 
</P>
<P>
"We may ultimately conclude that," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, he added, the Administration supports negotiations between 
Israel and Palestinians without specifying who those Palestinians should be. If 
representative Palestinians can be found outside of the PLO, Baker indicated, 
that would be the best result; but, if not, Israel would have to consider 
talking to the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Trust 
</P>
<P>
Yair Tsaban, a member of the Israeli Knesset (Parliament) from the leftist 
Mapam Party, told a seminar at the Brookings Institution in Washington that 
Israelis may not trust the PLO but that a growing number of them have concluded 
that some form of recognition is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way to examine the intentions (of the PLO) is around the negotiating 
table," Tsaban said. 
</P>
<P>
Tsaban was in the United States for a just-concluded meeting at Columbia 
University in New York that was attended by Israeli leftists and 
representatives of the PLO.

L.A. DEALERS TRY TO GET RID OF BANNED FRUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long before dawn Tuesday, work crews at Cal-Fruit Co.'s loading dock at the Los 
Angeles Produce Market began the sudden push for citrus. 
</P>
<P>
In the dark, workers strained behind hand trucks to wheel out tottering stacks 
of fruit crates to waiting trucks. Cal-Fruit forklifts whined around them, 
moving out pallets as quickly as they had been unloaded. By the time the sky 
lightened, row after row of plump grapefruits, oranges and lemons were ready 
for inspection at the edge of the dock. 
</P>
<P>
Citrus, sighed Jim Iwamoto, the firm's fruit manager, was "the only way to go" 
in the wake of a sudden U.S. Food and Drug Administration decision to place a 
hold on all grapes, peaches, plums and nectarines imported from Chile because 
of a cyanide scare. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got 15,000 boxes (worth between $180,000 and $210,000) from Chile just 
sitting in the warehouse right now," a frustrated Iwamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
As the final hours of a rough day came to a close Tuesday morning, fruit 
dealers in the downtown produce district were still scrambling to avoid being 
stuck with thousands of pounds of ripening Chilean imports. With time and the 
fragility of their wares working against them, every phone call and rushed 
conversation was seized upon as an opportunity to salvage a bad situation 
growing steadily worse. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, mornings breed healthy chaos at the Wholesale Produce Market and its 
sister facility, the ancient 7th Street Market, where about 50 wholesalers and 
smaller firms unload and dispense tons of fruits and produce destined each day 
for Southern California's markets and restaurants. But on Tuesday, the Chilean 
produce embargo put a nervous edge on the activity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sales to Mexico 
</P>
<P>
Some dealers inquired desperately about selling their goods to Mexico. Others 
warned darkly of dealers who might try to disguise their Chilean imports as 
American-grown. 
</P>
<P>
"The $64,000 question around here is what the hell we're gonna do with this 
stuff," said Jerry Vessey, the chief fruit salesman at Archie's Produce, where 
about 1,500 Chilean crates sat unopened. Answers never seemed to come. 
</P>
<P>
Vessey, a white-bearded man with 40 years in the fruit business, paused wearily 
from phone talks with buyers to describe the hole his firm is in. "Everything 
we've got is in cold storage right now," he said. "Some of it's ripe already. 
It's only a matter of days for what's left. I don't know who's gonna take a 
bath on this, but it's not gonna be just us." 
</P>
<P>
Fruit dealers at the Produce Market said that over the last several years, 
their firms have grown increasingly dependent on imports from Chile to bolster 
the winter selection of non-citrus fruits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fruit Improved 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be the Chilean fruit that came in wasn't up to California 
standards," said Guy Panno, a 30-year produce business veteran with the Sam 
Perricone Citrus Co. "You'd get a lot of rotten product, fruit with scars. But 
the last two years, it's come in really beautiful. A lot of the dealers were 
just getting used to it, and now this." 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the probability that Chilean imports might be impounded until 
California produce reaches local markets in early May, major wholesalers such 
as Cal-Fruit said they would use citrus fruits and other safe items, such as 
bananas and tropical imports, as substitutes for Chilean products on local 
supermarket shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Overnight, after area supermarkets had stopped buying produce from Chile, 
Cal-Fruit and other major produce dealers hauled their excess imports into 
chilly, cavernous storage rooms in the faint hope that the government's impound 
order would be lifted before the fruit rotted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sales Plummet 
</P>
<P>
The general manager of the largest importer of Chilean fruit in California said 
that the FDA's decision had caused sales to plummet overnight from $2.5 million 
a week to nothing. Rick Eastes, whose David Oppenheimer import firm brings in a 
third of California's crop from Chile, said the company would have to dispose 
of its entire stock within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Because the big fruit wholesalers buy their Chilean product in massive 
quantities, they expect to be able to return their Chilean shipments to 
importers for full refunds. "For us, it's more of an inconvenience than 
anything else," said Cal-Fruit's Iwamoto. 
</P>
<P>
But for the "second jobbers," the smaller dealers that buy from the wholesalers 
and then sell to food markets, schools and other institutions, the federal 
impoundment raised fears that they would have to "eat" their losses. 
</P>
<P>
County agriculture officials said that some jobbers might have insurance to 
tide them over, but it was uncertain whether they would have coverage for 
shipments impounded by the government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Irked by Jokes 
</P>
<P>
The jobbers' foul moods were hardly improved by the jokes that spread quickly 
among produce dealers who do not handle Chilean imports. "Crate of nectarines 
-- $1!" cried one wag. Yelled another, referring to the hasty refrigeration of 
the imports: "You looking for grapes from Chile? Try any icebox!" 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Vessey first heard the grim news the night before on television. His 
immediate reaction was instant and salty. As the morning progressed at Archie's 
Produce dock in the new terminal, Vessey spent most of his time on the phone, 
bracing for nerve-wracking negotiations with importers and buyers over who 
would assume the financial responsibility for the heavy losses that loom ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the government could have done more analysis," Vessey said. And to the 
news that the Agriculture Department had banned red table grapes after cyanide 
was detected in two grapes found in Philadelphia, Vessey added bitterly: "I 
mean, come on. Two grapes?" 
</P>
<P>
Over in the old 7th Street Market, fruit dealers had better things to do than 
grouse. At one stall, fragrant with the cloying odor of overripe fruit, Ruben 
L. Barraza hovered close to a white telephone while he discussed plans with 
fellow dealers to ship their Chilean plums, grapes and nectarines to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Problem' 
</P>
<P>
"I just have one way," said Barraza, a salesman for Manny's Produce who wanted 
to dispose of 2,000 crates from Chile. "I sell to Mexico. No problem. The 
people want to buy fruit there. It's my way." 
</P>
<P>
Barraza said he knew of no legal obstacles to selling fruit to a foreign 
country after it had been placed on administrative hold in the United States. 
But Leon Spaugy, the county's agricultural commissioner, said that any shipment 
from Los Angeles would have to be approved by federal officials before being 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that if they want to sell produce to a foreign country, 
the lot would have to be cleared first by the FDA," Spaugy said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Half the Original Cost 
</P>
<P>
Vessey, who is also considering selling his Chilean imports to Mexico, figures 
that most fruit dealers would only be able to sell their shipments for about 
half the original cost. But, he noted: "It's better than eating it." 
</P>
<P>
Other dealers warned that some renegade fruit merchants might try to disguise 
their Chilean fruit as American merchandise, transferring grapes, plums and 
other imported fruit into crates with domestic markings and trying to sell them 
to local stores. 
</P>
<P>
"All they have to do is find some American boxes," said Antonio Holguin, who 
sells part-time at Manny's. "It happens. I know people who do these things. 
People don't ask questions around here. And the people who do these things, 
they think they don't eat it, so who will be hurt? But what if my family buys 
it?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fruit Inspection 
</P>
<P>
Once the fruit is inspected at the market, Spaugy said, there is no mechanism 
to weed out domestic produce from foreign produce. "There's no foolproof way," 
he said. "I'd like to think that there aren't too many immoral people out there 
who would do something like that." 
</P>
<P>
Outside one stall at the old 7th Street Market, though, more than 25 empty 
grape boxes were piled up in the trash. Small purple decals on each box gave 
away the fruit's country of origin: 
</P>
<P>
"Quality Produce of Chile." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE WARNING OVER FRUIT 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA's warnings about fruit from Chile include grapes, peaches, 
blueberries, blackberries, seedless watermelons, cantaloupes, Juan Canary and 
honeydew melons, raspberries, nectarines, quinces, Granny Smith green apples, 
cactus pears, pears and plums. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers should not worry about fruit already eaten because cyanide is 
fast-acting. 
</P>
<P>
The two grapes in which cyanide was confirmed had been punctured and were 
discolored, with a ring of crystalline material around the puncture, the FDA 
said. A third grape near the other two was "slashed" but no cyanide was 
detected. 
</P>
<P>
Some cyanide occurs naturally in acidic fruit. Potassium or sodium cyanide 
converts to hydrogen cyanide and dissipates.

STATE HEALTH CHIEF ASSAILS BAN ON APPLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Health Services Director Kenneth W. Kizer on Tuesday denounced school 
districts for "precipitously" banning apples from lunch menus and sending "the 
wrong message" to children that fruits and vegetables are unsafe to eat. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer munched calmly on a Red Delicious apple to emphasize his point that 
"apples are good for you." He accused school district officials of succumbing 
to a "little bit of hysteria" and creating a "toxic bogyman" by banning the 
fruit due to concerns over children ingesting daminozide, a chemical sometimes 
used in growing apples. 
</P>
<P>
His remarks at an afternoon press conference in Los Angeles came even as the 
apple boycott spread through California and the rest of the nation, with 
Chicago and a major school district in the Washington metropolitan area 
following the lead of New York City and Los Angeles Unified School District 
school officials in banning the fruit pending further study. 
</P>
<P>
An informal survey Tuesday found that a majority of Los Angeles County school 
districts had joined the apple boycott. In Orange County all but five of 28 
districts had banned apples. In San Diego County, however, only six of 43 
districts had stopped serving the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the spreading boycott, Kizer said the health risks from eating apples 
treated with the chemical, known under the trade name as Alar, are "exceedingly 
low" and are based "on a very large consumption over a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
Californians, he said, face a greater risk of cancer if they eschew fruits and 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
"We know, incontrovertibly, that the dangers of not eating fruits and 
vegetables far outweigh any health danger from eating fruits and vegetables 
with trace levels of this pesticide on it. 
</P>
<P>
"When we send a message to kids that fruits and vegetables are unsafe, what are 
they going to eat?" he asked, "Twinkies . . . and other junk" that is low in 
fiber, high in fat, sugar and salt. Such a diet, he said, has been shown to 
cause cancer, heart disease, hypertension and other chronic ailments. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer called the school apple boycott "an unforeseen outcome" of a recent study 
by the Natural Resources Defense Council that concluded that children who 
consume tainted apples are particularly at risk of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Al Meyerhoff, a council spokesman, acknowledged that the group did not 
specifically call for schools to ban apples, but said that the boycott is "an 
appropriate response until there is some assurance given that the carcinogen is 
out of the food supply." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the cancer risk to children posed by Alar-tainted apples is 1,000 
times higher than what the federal Environment Protection Agency has set as an 
acceptable limit. 
</P>
<P>
The charge has prompted federal health officials to closely examine studies 
they have conducted during the last eight years which, they say, have shown 
harmless and declining amounts of Alar in apples and apple products. It is 
estimated that only about 5% of the nation's apple crop -- all outside 
California -- now is treated with Alar. Major supermarket chains have taken 
steps to assure customers that their apples are free of Alar. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, the California Grocers Assn., a trade organization representing 
7,000 grocers, from major chains to convenience stores, estimated that in the 
last few days sales of apples have plummeted by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
"We are really concerned about the situation," said Don Beaver, association 
president. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA, which has been studying Alar's health effects for years, has contended 
that the chemical does not warrant an immediate ban. But EPA officials will 
decide during the next 18 months whether the chemical should be banned. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Shank, deputy director of the center for food safety at the Food and Drug 
Administration, said that his office is reviewing all studies "to see if we 
missed the boat." 
</P>
<P>
He said, "We think our studies are good, but sometimes there are people who 
have differing opinions." 
</P>
<P>
A study in 1988, he said, showed that out of 96 samples of apples, 35 had 
residues of Alar ranging from barely measurable to a high of 3.7 parts per 
million. The level of tolerance, he said, is 20 parts per million. 
</P>
<P>
State education officials have asked Kizer's office to test for Alar in apple 
products distributed to schoolchildren in this state. Nine samples of juice, 
apple slices and applesauce have been collected for testing from two 
warehouses, one in Sacramento and the other in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer said he believes that the tests will show trace amounts of the chemical 
in apples. But he said that, even so, he does not think that the amounts will 
be high enough to warrant elimination of apples from school diets. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said that the apple ban by school officials has been "very 
precipitous and was not done based on any thoughtful analysis of the risk posed 
by that versus the risk posed by swimming in swimming pools or drinking public 
water." 
</P>
<P>
In reaction to Kizer's criticism, Richard Farrar, director of food services for 
the San Francisco Unified School District, which banned apples, said: "There 
might be some truth to that. However, we are dealing with children. If tests 
are being performed, would it really harm anyone to wait a few weeks until the 
tests are completed? If we erred, we erred on the side of caution." 
</P>
<P>
David Koch, administrator of the Los Angeles Unified School District's business 
services division, also defended his district's decision to temporarily remove 
apples from the school lunch menu. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a temporary discontinuance while we make tests," Koch said. "It's not a 
permanent ban. We feel it is reasonable under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the apple boycott spread through school districts across the country 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've received a huge volume of calls from across the country from school 
officials asking for more information about this because of tremendous pressure 
(that) their food service operations are receiving from parents," said Chris 
Lecos, spokesman for the FDA in Washington. "Many are indicating they will stop 
serving apples because of the current furor over this." 
</P>
<P>
Lecos said that the Fairfax County school district in northern Virginia, which 
serves the metropolitan Washington area, has joined the apple boycott. And in 
Chicago, a school district spokesman said that apples have been pulled from the 
school menus. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 409,000 students and they consume about 200,000 apples a week -- or 
they used to," said Ken Masson, a Board of Education spokesman. He said the 
district is requesting all apple suppliers to provide certified statements that 
their apples have not been treated with Alar. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Steve Delano, administrator of the food distribution section of 
the state Department of Education, said Tuesday that his office has been 
"buried under phone calls from all over the state" from school districts 
wanting to know whether they should follow Los Angeles Unified's example and 
take apples and related products off school menus. 
</P>
<P>
"They're asking basically the rhetorical question, 'Should we be concerned 
about apple products in general?' They may have apple pies, apple turnovers. 
They're looking at all the range of products they have," Delano said. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, consumer confidence in the safety of food seized center stage at 
the annual legislative conference of the California Grocers Assn., a trade 
organization representing 7,000 grocers, from major chains to convenience 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
For example, association president Don Beaver noted that in only the past few 
days statewide sales of fresh applies has plummeted by 20%. "We are really 
concerned about the situation," he said.

GONE TO THE DOGS;

<P>
GOLD-MINING TOWN LEFT WITH ONLY MEMORIES OF ITS HEYDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
DOGTOWN, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This 19th-Century Gold Rush town, five miles up a one-lane twisting mountain 
road from Angels Camp, is but a memory today. Not much is left of Dogtown, and 
what little is left is rapidly falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
In its heyday from 1849 to the turn of the century, Dogtown was one of the 
biggest hydraulic mining camps in California. Hundreds of men operating giant 
hoses equipped with rotating nozzles washed down vast mountain slopes here in 
search of gold. 
</P>
<P>
"There were Chinese, Chilean, Cornish, French, Indian, Mexican, black and 
Yankee miners. There were hotels, boardinghouses, a dance hall, stores, 
saloons, a red-light district and hundreds of cabins and tents scattered 
about," recalled Gloyd A. (Bud) Ponte. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a booming mining camp full of stray dogs. That's how it came by its 
strange name," explained Ponte, 71, a rancher, long-time president of the 
Calaveras Historical Society and a fourth-generation Dogtowner. 
</P>
<P>
And, for 20 years Dogtown was the home of Windsor A. Keefer, a suave, 
sophisticated promoter with dark, wavy hair who was reputed to be the 
best-dressed man in the Mother Lode. He often wore ankle-length fur coats. 
</P>
<P>
A local reservoir bears his name. He built it. He was one of the owners of what 
is now Calaveras Big Trees State Park, 20 miles northeast of here. 
</P>
<P>
He owned several mines and water companies. He erected one of the first 
electric-generating plants in the West. He was also accused of floating bogus 
mining stock and bilking investors in many of his enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
On March 24, 1897, he vanished, never again to be seen. "Was He Murdered?" "Did 
He Flee to Avoid the Wrath of His Victims?" headlined the newspapers. Stories 
about the mysterious disappearance of Dogtown's best-known resident filled 
California newspapers for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years later, it was reported that Keefer was seen in Paris, living the 
life of luxury. But there is no proof that the story was true. 
</P>
<P>
Today, all that remains of old Dogtown are scattered building foundations and 
half a dozen wooden structures on the verge of collapse. Surrounding ranches 
and three homes of relatively recent vintage along French Gulch Creek occupy 
what once was a riotous mining camp. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still gold in these hills. Those old-time miners didn't get it all," 
insisted Lenny Owen, 33, one of three prospectors living in Dogtown. Bernie 
Dorsey, 43, and his wife Carolyn, 33, are the other two who hope to strike it 
rich in the old Dogtown diggings. 
</P>
<P>
Rancher Bud Ponte's great-grandfather was one of the original Dogtown miners. 
He had been a ship's captain, sailing out of El Paraiso, Chile, when he got 
gold fever, gave up the sea and sought his fortune here. 
</P>
<P>
Ponte was born in Dogtown, as were his parents and grandmother. His 
grandparents and father went to Dogtown School. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed to a collection of old news stories that document the town's share 
of gunfights, excitement, tragedies and unusual occurrences. When the Ross 
Reservoir gave way in 1899 and flooded Dogtown, it swept away a good part of 
the mining camp, including Otto Lunt, who rushed to his cabin to save his dog. 
</P>
<P>
Lunt, a miner from Germany, was last seen alive holding his dog in his arms and 
waving from the window of his cabin as it floated away in the raging waters. 
</P>
<P>
One news story described the suicide of Charlie Ferants, a singer of Spanish 
songs in a Dogtown cabaret. He hanged himself from a tree. Shortly after that, 
the tree died, too. 
</P>
<P>
Another story was about woodchopper Manuel Lopez, who found $300 in $20 gold 
pieces in a hollow in a tree he felled. He took the money, went to town and 
drank himself to death, all in the same day. 
</P>
<P>
"All we have left is memories. Like memories of the old Dogtown schoolteachers: 
Lizzie Kaler, Mayme Duffy, Annie Gallagher, and Mrs. Mulgrew," Ponte mused. 
</P>
<P>
"Justice in Dogtown was quick in my great-grandfather's time. If somebody did 
something wrong -- robbed somebody, stole a horse or assaulted a woman -- he 
was strung up before sundown. That was the way it was when Dogtown was in its 
prime."

RESISTANCE TO DRUG FOUND IN TESTS OF SOME AIDS PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists have detected resistance to the commonly used anti-AIDS drug AZT in 
blood samples drawn from a small number of AIDS patients who have received the 
medication for more than six months, it was announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The laboratory findings of resistant strains of the AIDS virus -- which 
researchers said were not unexpected -- are likely to have no immediate effect 
on the use of AZT in AIDS patients. AZT was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration in 1987 for many patients with either AIDS or advanced 
AIDS-related conditions. 
</P>
<P>
But the new research, from the UC San Diego Medical Center and Wellcome 
Research Laboratories in Britain, is likely to stimulate efforts to design AIDS 
treatments that combine AZT with other medicines. 
</P>
<P>
Previous research has suggested that AZT can prolong the lives of AIDS patients 
for an average of one to two years. AZT blocks the replication of HIV, the 
virus that causes AIDS, but does not rid the body of the infection. As a 
result, the immunodeficiency caused by HIV continues to progress. 
</P>
<P>
AZT can also cause serious side effects, such as anemia, requiring 
discontinuation of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
The new findings may also cause some physicians and patients to rethink the use 
of AZT in the early stages of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus. 
Although the benefit of AZT in the early stages of HIV infection has not been 
established, the antiviral drug is widely prescribed in this situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very strongly that no change in the management of individual (AIDS) 
patients should be based on these data," Dr. Douglas Richman, a professor of 
pathology at UC San Diego, said. He expressed concern that misinterpretation of 
the findings would create inappropriate "fear or hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
Richman, one of three authors of the new study, said that resistance happens 
"with all drugs and all bugs and all tumor cells." He said it was "not 
surprising" in the case of HIV. A germ is considered resistant when it develops 
the ability to grow in the presence of even high concentrations of a drug. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, the resistance has not been proven to have clinical significance," Dr. 
Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases in Bethesda, Md., told Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
"People who are on AZT and are currently benefiting from AZT should not panic 
and consider this a major setback," Fauci said. "Just because one can isolate a 
resistant strain from a patient doesn't mean AZT is not effective in combatting 
most of the viral replication in the patient." 
</P>
<P>
The early announcement of the findings, which are to be published in the 
journal Science on March 31, was made at press conferences in London and San 
Diego on Tuesday and in letters mailed by AZT's manufacturer, Burroughs 
Wellcome Co. of Research Triangle Park, N.C., to AIDS physicians and infectious 
disease specialists around the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regulators' Demand 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Bartlett, a spokeswoman for Burroughs Wellcome, said the results were 
being released by the company so that physicians could put them "in the proper 
context if questions came up from their patients." But, according to Richman, 
"British regulatory agencies," which oversee Wellcome PLC, the parent company 
for Burroughs Wellcome, had "demanded" the release. 
</P>
<P>
Bartlett, Richman and Jeffrey L. Teramani, a spokesman for Science, all 
declined to make available a copy of the scientific paper. Many physicians 
consider it impossible to put findings into the proper context without 
reviewing the actual research report. 
</P>
<P>
The new study involved 11 patients who had received AZT for more than six 
months, according to Monday's "Dear Doctor" letter from Dr. S.W. Singleton, 
vice president of medical affairs for Burroughs Wellcome. 
</P>
<P>
When samples of the patients' blood were tested in the laboratory, many were of 
"reduced sensitivity," including blood from five patients that had "very marked 
reductions in sensitivity," the letter said. "Longer durations of treatment 
were associated with progressively less sensitive virus." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Studies Made 
</P>
<P>
Richman said, "Some of the isolates were a hundredfold more resistant (than 
prior to AZT treatment)." He termed the findings a "pretty straightforward and 
consistent observation." 
</P>
<P>
Richman said studies are in progress to determine the mechanism of HIV 
resistance to AZT and to determine if asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals 
developed AZT resistance in a comparable fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Singleton's letter cautioned that "no correlations were evident" between the 
development of resistance to AZT in the laboratory and changes in the patients' 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
The letter said that, "Clinical decisions based on correlations between in 
vitro (test tube) sensitivities of virus and plasma concentrations of drug may 
be inappropriate and the clinical implications of these findings are therefore 
not clear." 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs Wellcome officials said that more than 20,000 people throughout the 
world are estimated to be taking AZT, which is also known as azidothymidine or 
zidovudine.

ASSEMBLY PANEL BACKS 5-CENT HIKE IN GAS TAX 
</P>

<P>
A proposed 5-cent increase in the state's gasoline tax survived its first 
legislative test Tuesday, winning overwhelming approval in the Assembly 
Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The committee endorsed the measure by Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) and 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) in an 11-1 vote, although several 
committee members indicated that some controversial provisions would have to be 
altered before they could vote for it on the Assembly floor. It now moves to 
the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which requires approval by a two-thirds majority in both legislative 
houses, calls for substantial increases in gasoline taxes and truck weight fees 
to finance a 10-year, $21.5-billion program to upgrade the state's overburdened 
transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
It would hike the state gasoline tax by 5 cents and truck weight fees by 30% 
initially and then continue to increase the fees and the tax every two years 
for the next decade according to a formula based on the rate of inflation. By 
the year 2000, transportation analysts estimate, the state's 9-cents per gallon 
gas tax would rise to 24 cents per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
"This $20 billion over the next 10 years is not going to solve all the problems 
(but) it . . . will go a long way to getting us off the dime and getting us 
into the next century in far better shape than sitting on our duffs and doing 
nothing," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee vote on the bill generally followed party lines, although one 
Republican, Assemblywoman Bev Hansen (R-Santa Rosa), cast her ballot with the 
majority. The single vote in opposition came from Assemblyman Charles 
Quackenbush (R-Saratoga). Several members who were present did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
Katz will need support from the ranks of the Assembly's 33 Republicans to win a 
two-thirds majority on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman William P. Baker (R-Danville) said there is strong support among 
Republicans for transportation improvements. But he predicted that a major 
problem will be to get lawmakers to look beyond the concerns of their own 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have north and south splits and urban and rural splits. We're 
going to have every split you can find. Everybody's going to have to give up 
something before we can achieve that goal (to improve transportation)," he said 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
In the committee debate, Baker, took issue with a key provision in the bill 
requiring cities and counties to reduce urban congestion by 5% each year for 
five years to be eligible for additional money for local street and road 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
He said the provision would penalize those areas with the severest traffic and 
growth problems and probably ensure that Los Angeles, for example, would be 
excluded "from getting into this pot." 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that's the difference between you and me," Katz said. "I'm willing to 
make Los Angeles take the heat for reducing congestion as part of getting their 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Katz said later that he would not compromise on the provision but that he did 
expect to accede to Republican demands for efficiency reforms within the state 
Department of Transportation. Many have complained that the department is 
overstaffed and that too much transportation money is being devoted to 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also faces another roadblock that was not debated by the committee 
-- Republican Gov. George Deukmejian's opposition to any gas tax increase that 
does not require voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
Although Katz's measure would not require voter approval, the voters would have 
to change the Gann amendment, a spending limit approved in a 1979 statewide 
election and named after anti-tax crusader Paul Gann, before any of the new 
money could be spent. Democrats and Republicans agree that the limit as now 
written would prevent spending any transportation funds raised by new gas taxes 
or truck weight fee increases. 
</P>
<P>
A "summit" called by the governor to discuss transportation issues is expected 
to consider the gas tax issue and the voter approval question at its final 
meeting later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, the Assembly Speaker, said many of the businessmen invited to the 
"summit" have lost hope of reaching a compromise with Deukmejian, but "I am not 
that pessimistic." 
</P>
<P>
"I am hopeful that we can, in fact, produce a gas tax increase.

BUT IT'S NOT EXPECTED TO SHORTEN FLIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
SHUTTLE HAS FAULTY FUEL CELL PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla.

<P>
The shuttle Discovery raced around the globe at speeds exceeding 17,000 m.p.h. 
Tuesday as ground controllers watched and listened through the most 
comprehensive communications system ever available to a manned space flight. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, nobody had much to say. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a fairly low-key day," is the way flight director Al Pennington put 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle and its crew of five zipped around the planet, 187 miles up, in a 
"selective power down" mode, which meant that nonessential electrical equipment 
had been shut off because of a faulty fuel cell in a system that generates part 
of the power used aboard the spacecraft. The problem was not considered a 
hazard for the crew, and officials with the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration said they doubted they would have to land earlier than planned 
-- at 6:34 a.m. Saturday at Edwards Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Landing Unlikely 
</P>
<P>
At worst, Pennington said, the flight could be cut short by one day and end on 
Friday, "but right now, we're still planning on landing on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
The problem was an erratic pressure reading on one of three tanks that supply 
liquid hydrogen. The liquid hydrogen combines with oxygen in fuel cells to 
produce electricity on board, with water as a byproduct. Turning off one of the 
cells while engineers on the ground studied the power system also meant turning 
off a few lights and other nonessential equipment. 
</P>
<P>
While the crew carried out assigned chores quietly Tuesday, the shuttle was in 
contact with Mission Control 85% of the time -- far more than any other 
spacecraft has been able to maintain -- thanks to the communications satellite 
launched from Discovery during its flight in September. That mission was the 
first since the shuttle Challenger exploded on liftoff in January, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite lifted into orbit in September is now in 
full operation in a stationary orbit 22,300 miles above the Atlantic Ocean, 
over the northern coast of Brazil. With a sister satellite stationed over the 
Pacific, the network covers 85% of the globe. Except for a narrow "exclusion 
zone" over the Indian Ocean, a shuttle now can maintain almost constant contact 
with Mission Control. Although the two-satellite system was partially working 
for a Defense Department mission late last year, this is the first manned space 
flight since it has been fully operational, NASA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The system will be augmented by a third satellite, the one the Discovery 
deployed six hours after the shuttle's launching from Kennedy Space Center on 
Monday. The newest satellite, a replacement, has reached its position above 
Brazil, and the older satellite there will serve as a spare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Weeks to Check Satellite 
</P>
<P>
Although it will take several weeks to check out the new satellite fully, 
officials said there had been no problem with it so far. 
</P>
<P>
The two-satellite system can handle six times as much data as a string of 
ground stations that NASA will now be able to close. Each satellite can 
transmit 37 million characters -- approximately the equivalent of 10 sets of 
encyclopedias -- every second. 
</P>
<P>
That capability allows NASA to transmit enormous amounts of data between the 
shuttle and ground controllers. The same satellites also transmit television 
pictures and audio communications, and they can serve as many as 24 spacecraft 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
With the satellite deployment behind them Tuesday, the Discovery crew members 
already could count this mission a success. They seemed content just to watch 
over a few experiments, mostly in silence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eggs Come Through Without a Crack 
</P>
<P>
Pennington, the flight director, said the crew checked out 32 fertilized 
chicken eggs carried aboard the craft as part of a student experiment, and 
found no problems. The eggs, which will be hatched later for a study of how 
weightlessness affects developing embryos, appeared to have come through the 
rigors of liftoff without a crack, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He offered little information, however, about the four rats that are part of 
another experiment. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't interface" with the rats, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the launching, tiny holes were drilled into the rats' hind legs so that 
their healing processes could be studied in space. The rats also are part of a 
student experiment. 
</P>
<P>
The Discovery commander is Michael L. Coats, 43. Others in the crew are John E. 
Blaha, 46, the pilot, and mission specialists James F. Buchli, 43, Robert C. 
Springer, 46, and James P. Bagian, 37.

30 KILLED, 100 HURT AS BEIRUT FIGHTING ESCALATES

<P>
At least 30 people were killed and about 100 wounded in Beirut on Tuesday, the 
worst day for civilian casualties in several years in Lebanon's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Artillery shells exploded in the streets, maiming children on the way to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Airplanes flew to Cyprus to avoid shelling at the Beirut airport, which was 
then closed. Ships put to sea in an effort to escape the artillery pounding. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Michel Aoun, premier and commander of the Christian army, accused Syrian 
army forces of initiating the fighting, the culmination of a week of escalating 
clashes. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun said the Syrians fired into both Christian East Beirut and Muslim West 
Beirut, triggering a daylong exchange of artillery between Christian and Druze 
militias in the hills southwest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun said his army will try to force the Syrian troops to withdraw from 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon cannot possibly stay under the mercy of the Syrian cannon," he told 
reporters at the presidential palace in suburban Baabda, in Christian territory 
five miles northeast of Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun called on the Muslims of West Beirut to rise up against the Syrians as 
Palestinians have risen up against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. 
</P>
<P>
He said he also asked the Arab League, which has been trying to mediate the 
crisis, to "intervene at once to ensure the withdrawal of the Syrian occupation 
army." The Syrians, brought in to put an end to the civil war, have been in 
Lebanon since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun's accusations were dismissed in Damascus as false. The official daily 
newspaper Al Baath said the charges were aimed at "devastating Syria's 
constructive role in Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
The shelling Tuesday morning caught Beirut civilians out in the streets at the 
height of the rush hour. Screaming mothers ran through streets to rescue 
children from schools in areas hit by shelling or from buses stranded in the 
open. Shopkeepers banged down their shutters as radio stations urged people to 
stay indoors and seek cover from the shelling. Banks also closed their doors. 
</P>
<P>
The shelling on both sides of the line seemed to be indiscriminate, according 
to reports reaching here, hitting near restaurants, bakeries, hospitals and 
U.N. buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's latest crisis began last September when the Lebanese Parliament 
failed to elect a successor to President Amin Gemayel. Gemayel then appointed 
Aoun as premier. The incumbent premier, Salim Hoss, a Muslim backed by Syria, 
refused to step aside, leaving the country with two competing governments and 
no president. 
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fighting began about a week ago when Aoun decided to close 
down small ports that have been used by Christian and Muslim forces to bring in 
arms and duty-free goods.

From behind the thick glass of his armored limousine, President Bush spotted 
the cluster of homeless people on Vermont Avenue here as he sped to a speech at 
a downtown hotel. 
</P>
<P>
From his windows in the White House, he can see them too -- "ragged, pathetic 
figures huddled over the steam grates of the Ellipse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
They are, he told an insurance agents' conference Tuesday, "an affront to the 
American dream -- a national shame, if you will." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faces Problems 
</P>
<P>
The President used his speech to the national legislative conference of the 
Independent Insurance Agents of America to call attention to this problem and a 
number of others that he said he must address as his legislative agenda takes 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
"My agenda is this: to confront the emerging problems of the future today," 
Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that the President, "within 
the next few days," will outline his views on the recent report from his 
handpicked ethics commission on improving ethical standards for government 
officials, and that he is setting in motion a series of Administration meetings 
with congressional leaders on the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also spoke of a need to review the awarding of huge damage judgments by 
juries in insurance cases. 
</P>
<P>
On the homelessness problem, he said: "Homelessness affects a small proportion 
of Americans but concerns us all. We must seek the root causes and devise the 
most practical solutions for the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the President was planning an initiative to tackle the 
problem, Fitzwater told reporters that the remarks represented "a follow-up to 
his general concerns expressed during the campaign." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Jack Kemp, secretary of housing and urban development, is "looking 
into a number of housing proposals at HUD with the President's direction and 
promotion." 
</P>
<P>
"The word has gone forth to come up with solutions, and that's the direction 
we're moving in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of "tort reform," Bush told the insurance agents: "Of course, 
there are many litigants who deserve a jury's sympathy -- we can start from 
that premise.' 
</P>
<P>
But, gaining a wave of applause from the insurance agents, he said: "When local 
governments cannot install playgrounds, when businesses are bankrupted, when 
mothers struggle to find an obstetrician . . . then it is time to consider 
limiting some of these outrageous settlements." 
</P>
<P>
"Tort reform is critical to the health of businesses and volunteer 
organizations alike," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Studying Proposals 
</P>
<P>
Later, Fitzwater said that the Justice Department "is taking a look" at reform 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the day, Bush dropped in on a meeting among leaders of the 
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and senior White House officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We must condemn all attacks on the Jewish religion, the Jewish heritage, 
clearly, unequivocally and without exception," he told the group. "This nation 
must stand for tolerance, for pluralism and a healthy respect for the rights of 
all minorities."

MCFARLANE DETAILS HOW NORTH GOT INSTRUCTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Former National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane testified Tuesday that he 
"passed along" a presidential directive in 1984 to Lt. Col. Oliver L. North 
that "we've got to find a way to keep (the Contra rebels in Nicaragua) together 
body and soul." 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane, who was North's boss and then-President Ronald Reagan's aide, said 
that Reagan expressed anger at the congressional cutoff of military assistance 
for the rebel forces because he "felt deeply" about their cause and thought 
Congress was "breaking faith with the freedom fighters who had risked their 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane related Reagan's instructions in the most specific terms to date 
under cross-examination by Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., North's attorney. Sullivan 
has been trying to show jurors at North's trial how the retired Marine officer 
was motivated to direct a secret program of financial assistance for the 
Contras after Congress prohibited it in 1984. North's defense maintains that he 
believed he had high-level authorization for his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane said that Reagan's instructions were given to him at a meeting in the 
summer of 1984 and that he "passed them along" to Adm. John M. Poindexter, his 
deputy, and to North, who had been designated as "point man" to keep in touch 
with Contra leaders. Poindexter has been charged with conspiracy and other 
crimes in the Iran-Contra scandal and is due to stand trial separately after 
North. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane, although he is the prosecution's chief witness against North, 
finished his questioning by prosecutor John W. Keker on a note of tension when 
Keker accused him of writing a "nonsense" note to Congress shortly before his 
1987 suicide attempt. Keker, apparently piqued because McFarlane has sought to 
excuse North's role in drafting allegedly misleading letters to Congress signed 
by McFarlane about the Contra effort, suddenly turned on the witness and 
questioned his credibility. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane, who has pleaded guilty and been sentenced for misleading Congress, 
testified that he sought to clarify some of his false statements by sending a 
personal note to Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), then chairman of the House 
Intelligence Committee, on Feb. 8, 1987 -- the day before he took a drug 
overdose at home. 
</P>
<P>
But Keker, citing apparently misleading figures about Contra aid in the note, 
said to McFarlane: "That was just complete nonsense, wasn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
"It was not!" McFarlane shot back, angrily. 
</P>
<P>
His voice rising, the normally low-key McFarlane continued: 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Keker, if I had sat down in my state of mind the day before I tried to 
take my life -- if I had tried to parse every last dime that went to the 
Contras -- it probably would have come out different." 
</P>
<P>
Keker pointed out that McFarlane's 1987 note admitted knowledge of about a 
$5-million contribution from a foreign national "from his own wealth" for the 
Contras, although he previously testified that he had failed to tell 
congressmen in 1985 about his role in collecting part of a $32-million donation 
from the Saudi Arabian ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane, glaring at Keker, said: "If that's your point, you're right. I'm 
dead wrong. I knew darn well it was something close to a million dollars a 
month. . . . But I was acknowledging my participation in a third-country 
donation. And I wanted that on the record." 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane has previously testified that while Reagan never told his aides to 
lie to Congress, the former President instructed them not to share certain 
information with Congress, including solicitation of Contra aid from third 
countries while the congressional prohibition was in place. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's cross-examination Tuesday also brought agreement from McFarlane 
that, in Sullivan's words, "you have a kind of gamesmanship in Washington 
between the executive branch and Congress -- they want to know something, and 
we try to tell them as little as possible." 
</P>
<P>
North is charged principally with making false statements to Congress and 
obstructing congressional inquiries into his support for the Contras.

President Bush's second defense secretary-designate, Republican Rep. Dick 
Cheney of Wyoming, moved quickly Tuesday to rally support for his confirmation, 
promising to make tough budget choices and to consult closely with lawmakers on 
the controversial issue of nuclear missile modernization. 
</P>
<P>
But in his first day of confirmation hearings, Cheney, 48, cautioned against 
reducing U.S. military forces before the Soviet Union has made good on its 
promises to scale back Soviet forces. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real danger in the West that the perception of change (in the Soviet 
Union) will outstrip the reality of change," Cheney warned. The United States, 
he added, must not "fall into the trap here of responding to the proposal of 
the week" in devising its arms control negotiating positions and in seeking 
savings in defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
Hailed by home-state Republican Sen. Alan K. Simpson as "steady and 
unflappable," Cheney faced friendly questioning by the Democrat-controlled 
Senate Armed Services Committee, whose rejection of Bush's first choice, former 
Sen. John Tower (R-Tex.), led to Tower's defeat last Thursday on the Senate 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Senate's close scrutiny of Tower's personal life, Cheney 
took pains to allay fears that his heart condition would impose restrictions on 
his service. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter delivered Tuesday to committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), 
Washington-based cardiologist Allan M. Ross said that Cheney, who has had three 
heart attacks since 1977, has been cleared "to pursue unrestricted professional 
and recreational objectives." 
</P>
<P>
He wrote that Cheney's high cholesterol levels have been reversed with drugs, 
but added that "Cheney's pharmacological regimen is free of any side effects 
that would affect his judgment or behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Ross' letter was one of several documents, including tax filings and extensive 
financial disclosure forms, that the Senate panel has received on Cheney since 
the Wyoming legislator was chosen last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn promised that the committee will deal with Cheney's nomination speedily 
and some lawmakers said they hope he can be confirmed later this week. But 
Nunn, who engineered Tower's 53-47 Senate defeat last week, would not give a 
timetable, warning that no final action will be taken before the White House 
provides further documents, including a full background check by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not be taking any shortcuts," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater was asked when the FBI 
checks on Cheney will be finished. "They're trying to move those as rapidly as 
possible. . . . I don't have a specific date," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney also sought to assure committee members that his lack of military 
service was not the result of any effort to avoid the draft. Cheney volunteered 
an explanation for his failure to serve in the military. When he became 
eligible for the draft in 1959, Cheney said, older men were being drafted. He 
added that he was in school pursuing graduate degrees between 1963 and 1968, 
when he would likely have been drafted, and that he was given a parental 
deferment after 1966, when his first daughter was born. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I would have been happy to serve had I been called," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's comments on defense policy, an area in which his legislative 
experience has been limited, were greeted favorably by committee members who 
praised his reputation for competence. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said he had not made a decision on one of the most controversial issues 
facing him. He said that in the past he has backed development of a rail-based 
scheme for the MX missile as well as a small mobile missile widely known as 
Midgetman. 
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that he will have to make a decision soon. "Obviously we're 
in a situation where for budgetary reasons we have to make tough choices" 
between the two options, Cheney said. "Under ideal circumstances, we would be 
able to proceed with both," he added. 
</P>
<P>
He did, however, dismiss one of the principal criticisms lodged against the 
cheaper rail-based scheme for MX -- that it would be vulnerable to a surprise 
Soviet nuclear strike. 
</P>
<P>
"As a general proposition, I believe we do have adequate early warning 
capabilities," said Cheney, who has been a member of the House Select Committee 
on Intelligence for five years. "I personally think that the odds of a 
bolt-from-the-blue attack are extremely remote." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney also told the committee that the Bush Administration's decision to 
freeze the defense budget this year and permit only modest growth in the next 
may force many unpopular decisions, including possible reductions in "Star 
Wars" missile defenses and troop cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, we can't buy everything we want to buy with the money we 
have today," Cheney said. "I see that as a mandate."

The state Judicial Appointments Commission will hold a confirmation hearing 
April 5 in Los Angeles on the nomination of Appellate Justice Joyce L. Kennard 
to the California Supreme Court, it was announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's quick action opened the way for Kennard to take office less 
than four weeks after she was named by Gov. George Deukmejian to succeed 
Justice John A. Arguelles, who retired March 1. 
</P>
<P>
If confirmed as expected, Kennard would be sworn in immediately and be able to 
take the bench when the court hears arguments in pending cases during the week 
of April 10 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arguelles will remain temporarily with the court to conclude work on 
cases in which he has participated. 
</P>
<P>
Kennard's nomination must be approved by the majority of the three-member 
commission, which currently includes Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van de Kamp and Appellate Justice Lester W. Roth of Los Angeles, senior 
presiding justice of the state Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The commission said it will receive written communications from individuals who 
want to comment on the nomination until March 31. Those who want to testify 
before the commission on April 5 must file a request in writing, including a 
summary of their testimony, the commission said. The hearing is set to begin at 
1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Kennard, 47, now a member of the state Court of Appeal in Los Angeles, was 
nominated to the high court by Deukmejian last Saturday.

A judge sentenced two men Tuesday to more than 20 years each in prison for 
killing leftist political party leader Jaime Pardo Leal, court sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Jairo Torres Romero sentenced William Infante to 25 years and Beyer Yesid 
Barrera to 24 years for killing Pardo Leal, president of the left-wing 
Patriotic Union party, in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Infante was jailed for life in the United States last May for drug smuggling 
and Yesid Barrera is still at large, judicial sources said. 
</P>
<P>
A jury earlier this month found the two guilty of the killing but cleared a 
suspected leader of the Medellin cartel drug smuggling ring, Jose Gonzalo 
Rodriguez Gacha, and three others of involvement in the crime. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen killed Pardo Leal he drove back from his summer home near Bogota. 
His murder sparked riots in Bogota, and thousands of people attended his 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriotic Union has three seats in the 199-seat Chamber of Representatives 
and two in the 114-seat Senate. Party sources say opponents have killed around 
800 leaders and supporters since the party was founded in 1985.

TESTING THE BORDER OF ART AND POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Loudspeakers carry voices in Spanish and English into the streets. Activists 
brandishing walkie-talkies converse with their unseen comrades. Megaphones and 
video monitors bring still other voices and faces to a startled crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The setting could be the epicenter of a guerrilla combat zone. Or maybe it's 
just one of those avant-garde art-happenings we haven't seen much of for a 
decade or two. 
</P>
<P>
If it's hard to tell whether you're in the midst of one or the other, that's 
because the event you've just happened upon is both. 
</P>
<P>
Taking it to the streets -- literally and figuratively -- in "Fronteriso 
Conceptual," an evening of multiracial, multiethnic, multimedia performance art 
on Friday at 9, will be Los Angeles performers Elia Arca and Tim Miller, 
poet-performer-musician Ruben Guevara, poet Ruben Martinez and San 
Diego-Tijuana performers Guillermo Gomez-Pena and Emily Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
Their "eminently political" work will be part of the festivities marking the 
one year anniversary of Macondo Espacio Cultural, an alternative space for 
Latino performing arts at 3068 W. 7th St. And the performers plan for their 
tactics to be as insistent as their multicultural message. 
</P>
<P>
Like New York's immigrant Squat Theater -- which used similar strategies to 
open up the traditional boundaries of stage and audience -- these Californians 
employ performance to "question authority." 
</P>
<P>
And while the multimedianess of the performance is an obvious metaphor for the 
evening's theme of communication, participants are equally concerned with the 
barriers in the way of such exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us have different takes on this idea of the border," explains Martinez, 
an Angeleno of "Mexican-Salvadoran" heritage. "It's a multipurpose metaphor for 
the self and other, distances between two countries and two cultures." 
</P>
<P>
"North American or 'continental' culture -- in the new, reappropriated sense of 
the word -- is increasingly about the borders between all kinds of people, 
whether built around culture, ethnicity, gender or whatever," adds Miller, 
whose performance often centers around the gay experience. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to challenge those borders through creative work," says Miller. 
"And move on to the next step which is cultural fusion." 
</P>
<P>
And, as activist artists, they insist on the inseparability of artistic and 
social agendas. "We need to transcend the aesthetic borders that limit our work 
to try to achieve a universal poetic," Martinez suggests. 
</P>
<P>
Hence the guerrilla theater strategies: "We have to re-appropriate the 
technology that poets used to fear and redefine the space between audience and 
performers," says Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
But the task is greater than simply displaying the various cultures. "Along 
with this idea of cultural sensitivity and people within their own communities 
doing community specific work is also this emerging idea that it's not enough 
to just be staying in our little fiefdoms," Miller asserts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not enough to just turn the cultural-specific works into museum pieces, 
although the ruling structure would prefer that -- since people getting 
involved with each other can be a threatening idea." 
</P>
<P>
Further, Miller, who is co-director with Linda Frye Burnham of Highways, a 
performance space which opens in May, sees "this project as indicative of the 
kind of text that could be going on, a politically and emotionally challenging 
kind of multiculturalism." 
</P>
<P>
Which is not to say these artists don't see visibility as at least a first 
step. "It's great that the dialogue is opening up," says Guevara, a Chicano 
born in Boyle Heights and famous for his rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a recognition by the mainstream art establishment that we exist," 
Guevara continues. "(But) there's still that separation: it's 'us' and 'them.' 
</P>
<P>
"That's why (the performers in this project) want to address that 
(oversimplification) and be confrontational," Guevara insists. "We don't just 
want to talk about the problem, but also to show its ramifications, to reach 
out and get a hold of our common humanity." 
</P>
<P>
Achieving this next step will require changes in the status quo. "We need 
structures that encourage the new terrain that is intercultural work -- spaces, 
funding, press," Miller offers. "And artists have to once again see themselves 
as social thinkers and visionaries and not just as entrepreneurs."

Overlapping radio messages between a pilot and air traffic controllers probably 
led to a jet crash Feb. 28 in the Azores that killed all 144 people aboard, 
Portuguese investigators said in Lisbon. They said that because of the 
overlapping conversations, the pilot apparently descended to 2,000 feet when he 
should have remained at 3,000. The American-chartered Boeing 707, filled with 
Italian tourists on their way to the Caribbean, slammed into a fog-covered 
mountain on the island of Santa Maria.

A howling winter storm blanketed part of Wyoming with 32 inches of snow, then 
plowed into the nation's midsection, where snowdrifts shut down roads and 
schools in Wisconsin and 66 m.p.h. winds raked drought-stricken Kansas. The 
National Weather Service said 32 inches of snow buried Burgess Junction, Wyo., 
since the storm began Monday afternoon and 18 inches hit Story, Wyo. Blowing 
and drifting snow closed schools and highways in the northwestern corner of 
Wisconsin, and the weather service said the storm dropped up to 10 inches of 
snow in parts of the Dakotas and Minnesota. Forecasters posted winter storm 
warnings and high wind advisories from the Dakotas into upper Michigan. More 
than a foot of blowing, drifting snow was expected in several areas. The storm 
was blamed for icy roads that caused the crash of a school bus and a garbage 
truck in the Minneapolis suburb of Plymouth, shaking up a number of children.

An American Indian accused of kidnaping 14 people in a North Carolina newspaper 
office is being held in San Francisco on federal flight charges, an unusual 
step that may allow the government to avoid formal extradition proceedings. 
Lawyers for Eddie Hatcher accused the government of taking revenge on Hatcher 
for winning acquittal last October on federal hostage-taking charges. Hatcher, 
31, and Timothy Jacobs, 20, both Tuscarora Indians, were accused of holding as 
many as 20 people hostage for 10 hours in February, 1988, in the offices of The 
Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton, N.C. They said they were trying to draw 
attention to their allegations that law enforcement officials were involved in 
drug trafficking and other corruption. After their acquittal in federal court, 
the two men were indicted by a Robeson County grand jury last December on state 
kidnaping charges.

India's Parliament adjourned in an uproar after an hour of shouting and 
arguments over a newspaper report alleging that a powerful aide to Prime 
Minister Rajiv Gandhi was a possible suspect in the 1984 assassination of his 
mother, Indira Gandhi. The Indian Express quoted what it said were secret 
documents from a judicial panel saying that Indira Gandhi's longtime personal 
secretary, R. K. Dhawan, had suddenly changed her schedule Oct. 31, 1984, the 
day of the slaying, and was responsible for deploying the two Sikh bodyguards 
who killed her. Dhawan was fired by Rajiv Gandhi when he came to power but was 
returned to the inner circle last month.

Millions of commuters were stranded throughout Brazil at the start of a 48-hour 
general strike called against public transportation by leftist labor groups. 
However, many Brazilians ignored the strike call and went to work. 
International and domestic airlines flew on normal schedules, and supermarkets 
and gas stations opened. The subway in Sao Paulo operated normally but Rio de 
Janeiro's was shut down. Brazil's two largest labor movements -- the radical 
left Central Workers Union and the more moderate General Workers Central -- 
called the strike to protest President Jose Sarney's anti-inflation policy, 
which has frozen workers' pay since January.

Novelist Kurt Vonnegut and other U.S. writers presented a petition signed by 
more than 1,500 writers worldwide urging the U.N. Security Council to protect 
Salman Rushdie from a death sentence issued by Iranian leader Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini. Khomeini accuses Rushdie of engaging in blasphemy against 
Islam in his book "The Satanic Verses." But it appeared highly unlikely that 
the U.N. council would champion Rushdie's cause and antagonize Iran, which has 
agreed to U.N.-mediated peace talks after its war with Iraq. In Riyadh, Saudi 
Arabia, the issue of whether to support Khomeini's stand was referred to a 
committee of the 46-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference despite an 
appeal by Iran for "all Muslims to uphold God's judgment in this connection."

Government officials announced all National Weather Service stations will 
remain open through the mid-1990s, putting to rest rumors that 40 or more 
weather stations may soon close due to budget constraints. Commerce Secretary 
Robert A. Mosbacher said all stations will remain in service while a 
"comprehensive program to modernize the National Weather Service is completed." 
There will be no layoffs at the stations, officials said. The weather service 
currently has a national network of 52 weather forecast offices and 211 smaller 
weather stations.

TWO SLAIN IN GUNFIGHT AT STORE; BOY IS WOUNDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A shoot-out Tuesday among three would-be robbers and a Compton storekeeper, who 
purchased a .357-Magnum revolver last year to protect his family-run grocery, 
left two of the robbers dead and the store owner's 14-year-old son critically 
wounded, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Nine members of the family of the grocer, Jose Castillo Sr., were in the store 
and the small living quarters behind it, but none of the others were injured in 
the extensive gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began when three men, at least two of them armed, entered Chico's 
Mini-Market at about 4 p.m. and ordered two clerks behind the counter to give 
them the money in the cash register, Compton Police Sgt. Danny Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men was carrying a MAC 10 semiautomatic pistol and walked into a 
kitchen in the back of the store where he was confronted by Castillo, who had 
gotten his pistol and was loading it, according to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"The father reached for his gun and the guy with the MAC 10 started firing," 
Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman "sprayed" the back of the store with at least a dozen rounds, 
critically wounding Jose (Alfie) Castillo, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Castillo then returned the fire, killing two of the intruders. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Girard Bennett, 18, died at the scene, while Gerald Anthony Bennett, 26 
of Compton, died at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, Sneed said. The 
two men were not related, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fled With Gun in Hand 
</P>
<P>
The third would-be robber was seen running away from the store, located on the 
400 block of Wilmington Avenue, with a gun in his hand, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Castillo was undergoing surgery at the medical center late Tuesday 
and was listed in extremely critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
The store owner's daughter, Cynthia Castillo, 16, said she saw the gunmen enter 
the store and hold guns on two clerks near the cash register. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw them raise their hands and I saw one man pointing a gun and one putting 
money in a bag," she said. She said she ran to the back of the store carrying 
her 2-year-old infant brother and the man followed, apparently thinking she was 
going to call police. 
</P>
<P>
"Alfie stood up in between us and then I heard a shot and someone screaming," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Castillo said her father had purchased a gun about a year ago for 
protection. Although the store had never been robbed at gunpoint, it had often 
been victimized by shoplifters, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Armed Robbery 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia said she, her brothers, parents and other relatives all work at the 
grocery store and meat market near downtown Compton. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first armed robbery at the store, according to Sisto Morales, a 
neighbor who said he had leased the building to Castillo. "We were there for 30 
years and nothing happened so I think we were lucky," Morales said. 
</P>
<P>
Morales said Castillo, a butcher by trade, leased the business two years ago.

JUDGE CLEARS CAMBODIANS WHO KILLED DOG FOR FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Long Beach judge Tuesday dismissed all charges against two Cambodian refugees 
accused of misdemeanor cruelty to animals for killing a German shepherd puppy 
for food. 
</P>
<P>
"Under (the) facts, I don't believe it can be said that these defendants 
inflicted unreasonable pain on the animal," Long Beach Municipal Judge Bradford 
L. Andrews said in responding to a defense motion that the case be dismissed 
for lack of evidence. "To hold otherwise would subject every slaughterhouse 
employee or farmer to prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the case, Andrews had ruled that killing an animal for food is not 
illegal unless it is done in a cruel way. 
</P>
<P>
The two refugees -- Sokheng Chea, 32, and Seng Ou, 33 -- had admitted hitting 
the 4-month-old puppy over the head with a blunt instrument, slashing its 
throat and skinning it on the floor of Ou's Long Beach apartment. But in doing 
so, they said, they had been following their cultural customs with no idea that 
the action would be considered offensive to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considered Delicacies 
</P>
<P>
While local Cambodian leaders say the practice of eating dogs was rare in their 
country before the 1970s, other Asian leaders report that the animals are 
considered delicacies in such countries as Vietnam, Korea and the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach case had been closely watched by animal rights activists who 
said it was the first time to their knowledge that Southeast Asian refugees had 
been prosecuted for attempting to eat a dog. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed in the outcome," said Wendy Aragon, president of the Pet 
Assistance Foundation, based in Van Nuys. "I think that what these defendants 
did offends the sensibilities of the community. There is a need for legislation 
to outlaw the slaughter of dogs and cats; they are companion animals, not food 
animals." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the ruling by the judge early in the trial that killing a dog for 
food is not in itself a violation of the law, prosecutor Sarah Lazarus had to 
prove, in the judge's words, that the dog was "maimed, wounded, tortured, 
mutilated or tormented" in a manner beyond that required to prepare it as food. 
To prove her case, the prosecutor produced a neighbor who had witnessed part of 
the incident and two veterinarians, including one who had examined the carcass. 
</P>
<P>
Their testimony, in Judge Andrews' opinion, did not establish unequivocally 
that the animal was treated inhumanely and therefore did not constitute a case 
strong enough to submit to the jury. In dismissing the matter, however, he 
warned that the ruling should not be taken as a license to kill pets. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sympathetic to the feelings of those who champion the cause of animal 
rights," Andrews said, "but the remedy lies in convincing the Legislature to 
enact laws that would make the actions of these defendants unlawful." 
</P>
<P>
Both defendants expressed relief at the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"I am happy," Ou said through an interpreter, "but I can assure you that there 
will be no second time."

INTENSIVE CARE HELPS HOSPITALS MERGE SMOOTHLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When staff physicians first learned of an impending merger between the 
financially troubled Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center and the aging Queen 
of Angels Medical Center, they wondered what the new facility would be called. 
History was at play, along with bureaucratic egos and marketing considerations. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people said . . . it would be called Hollywood Angels," recalled Dr. Samy 
Farag, medical chief of staff last year at Hollywood Presbyterian. Others, more 
accurately, predicted the new name inevitably would be a mouthful. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the decision to settle on "Queen of Angels-Hollywood 
Presbyterian Medical Center" was one of the easier steps in a complicated 
melding of two of the city's oldest hospitals, which became official at a 
colorful ceremony Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Rooted in economics, the merger presented administrators, physicians, nurses 
and custodians with a long list of intriguing logistical challenges. The task 
involved everything from billing to bedpans, surgeons to signage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been fascinating, exciting, challenging and difficult," Richard F. Smith, 
chief administrator of the hospital, said before the ceremony. "The only 
problem will be if we merge with any more hospitals. Then we'd have to take 
down the Hollywood sign in the Hollywood Hills to fit our name in one place." 
</P>
<P>
It all began last November when officials of Hollywood Presbyterian and nearby 
Queen of Angels, owned by the Franciscan Sisters of the Sacred Heart, announced 
the merger. To many health care professionals, it seemed a marriage made in 
heaven for two hospitals suffering from occupancy rates of less than 50%. The 
Catholic order, whose facility is 60 years old, could supply some needed cash 
to the financially strapped Hollywood Presbyterian. In return, it would merge 
its staff into the 10-story, 3-year-old Hollywood Presbyterian Tower. 
</P>
<P>
Some wrinkles, including the question of which religion would prevail, were 
dealt with in the initial pact. The merged hospital, it was decided, would 
operate under Catholic rather than Presbyterian policies -- with no abortions, 
tubal ligations or vasectomies allowed. 
</P>
<P>
"There was the matter of the 'R' word -- religion," said hospital board 
Chairman J.J. Brandlin Tuesday. "Religion was an important aspect of the 
merger, (but) it took only about 15 minutes to solve all the issues." 
</P>
<P>
There also was the question of top billing. "We were having to close our 
hospital . . . and we provided some financing," explained Brandlin, who 
formerly served as vice chairman of the Queen of Angels board. "It's a very 
long name, but it was the easiest compromise." 
</P>
<P>
When it came time to address more pragmatic matters, hospital officials 
appointed a 30-member team headed by quality assurance director Dawn 
Vonderheide. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a six-week deadline, Vonderheide's team drafted plans for 
transferring all patients out of Queen of Angels. The team also picked and 
chose among the hospital's equipment and supplies, deciding which would be 
taken along and which would be discarded. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all supplies were trucked over to Hollywood Presbyterian, which had 
been running short. Wheelchairs, IV pumps, hospital beds, even bedpans, were 
transferred. 
</P>
<P>
"It was all the way down to Band-Aids," Vonderheide said. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials, who arranged a $21-million state-guaranteed loan to support 
the merger, prepared a layoff list for those in redundant jobs. Eventually 150 
employees from Queen of Angels and 300 more from Hollywood Presbyterian -- 
ranging from orderlies to Hollywood Presbyterian Chief Executive Allene 
Nungesser -- were let go. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians, meanwhile, established a credentialing process with assistance from 
state health officials, guaranteeing hospital privileges for the 1,000 medical 
staffers of the two facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Four days before the 404-bed Queen of Angels facility was permanently boarded 
up on Jan. 27, its emergency room and admissions ward were shut down. Over the 
course of that week, 60 Queen of Angels patients, many in critical condition, 
were rushed by ambulance two miles to the merged quarters at Vermont Avenue and 
Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"Some nurses started their shifts in the Queen of Angels critical care unit and 
ended up their shifts at Hollywood Presbyterian when we brought their patients 
here," Vonderheide said. "We couldn't just throw them in an ambulance (without 
their nurses)." 
</P>
<P>
Patients weathered the uprooting in good shape, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two staffs were rocky at first in some departments, 
employees said. Nurses from the old facility had to learn how to operate 
computers at the new one. They also had to be retrained on such procedures as 
chart-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult at first to get used to," said George Dean, an occupational 
therapist. "It's like going to another culture, a kind of medical culture 
shock." 
</P>
<P>
The move is still not finished, with new Catscan and mammography machines 
waiting to be moved from Queen of Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Also, no decision has been made on a new logo, so signs in the hospital and at 
the top of the 10-floor hospital tower still make no mention of Queen of 
Angels. Nor did the 1,000 balloons marked Hollywood Presbyterian that were 
released Tuesday at the conclusion of festivities.

VIDEOTAPED INTERVIEWS IN MCMARTIN CASE HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty-three witnesses and five months into its phase of the McMartin 
Pre-School molestation trial, the defense has launched what one attorney termed 
"the most crucial aspect of our case" -- an attack on videotaped interviews 
conducted with alleged child victims before charges were filed nearly five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys Tuesday concluded their questioning of clinical psychologist 
Michael P. Maloney, who told the jury that the controversial interviews with 
the children, conducted by Children's Institute International (CII) in late 
l983 and early 1984 and heavily relied upon by prosecutors, used improper 
techniques that may have "contaminated" the youngsters' later accounts of what 
occurred at the Manhattan Beach nursery school. 
</P>
<P>
One 9-year-old boy, for example, "in the early parts (of his interview) states 
he didn't know who Ray Buckey was" but by the end "was talking about him in a 
very direct fashion regarding specific (sexual) behaviors," Maloney noted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Molestation Charges 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, 30, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, are charged with 65 counts 
of molestation and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Maloney, testifying for the defense over the last two weeks, repeatedly 
criticized the interviewers at CII, a Los Angeles child abuse diagnostic and 
treatment center. He said they should have let the interviews progress 
according to the children's spontaneous comments, but instead talked more than 
the youngsters and utilized a sort of script that may have resulted in false 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way these kids were all machined right through the same process," Maloney 
testified under direct examination by defense attorney Dean Gits. "Toward the 
end of that process they were being asked very direct and almost coercive 
questions about sexual behavior. At those times, some of the children became 
fairly nonverbal and reverted to simply pointing and did so in a somewhat 
passive way and then sometimes even in a questioning way." 
</P>
<P>
The nine children who have testified against the Buckeys during the 2-year-old 
trial were among several hundred interviewed and physically examined at CII. 
</P>
<P>
The interviews began when the Los Angeles County district attorney's office 
asked a social worker there to evaluate several children. But as word of the 
investigation leaked and spread, parents whose children had attended the 
nursery school flocked to the center to have their children assessed for 
possible sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges Dropped 
</P>
<P>
Scores of children eventually were diagnosed as having been victimized, but 
many parents refused to allow their children to testify and Dist. Atty. Ira 
Reiner ultimately dropped charges against five of the seven teachers who had 
been ordered to stand trial after an 18-month preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, who began their cross-examination of Maloney late Tuesday, have 
admitted that the early interviews were flawed, but have defended the 
children's testimony as truthful. 
</P>
<P>
Maloney, the first expert witness called by the defense, testified that he was 
paid $35,000 to analyze the videotapes made by CII. He said he detected 17 
aspects of a "script" used by all three of the center's interviewers that, 
perhaps inadvertently, fed information to the children: 
</P>
<P>
The interview usually began with the child drawing a person and identifying 
body parts, with an emphasis on sexual organs. So-called anatomically correct 
naked dolls were then introduced, again with a focus on their sexual parts. 
Class photographs were shown to the children to jog their memories and they 
were told that others had already described abuses. They then were given 
puppets to use as mouthpieces enabling them to tell "yukky secrets" to a 
"secret machine," a tape recorder. 
</P>
<P>
The children were also told that other children had been scared by Ray Buckey, 
Maloney said. He said the interviewers referred to sneaky, tricky, naked games, 
implied that Ray Buckey was a bad person under surveillance by police and 
eventually moved into specific questions about sexual acts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allegedly Were Led 
</P>
<P>
"Those items were almost in every case that we end up with here," Maloney said, 
asserting that the questioning led the children to believe that something bad 
must have happened at the school and that, if they were "smart," they would 
tell about it too. 
</P>
<P>
The psychologist, who is highly respected and frequently consulted by both 
prosecutors and defense attorneys in child sexual abuse cases, also said the 
interviews indicate that the children had already received information about 
the investigation from parents, brothers and sisters, and friends, putting 
additional pressure on them. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Gits, who represents Peggy McMartin Buckey, said outside the 
courtroom, that "the essential thing Dr. Maloney has established is that these 
children came out of CII different from what they went in," and that the 
interviews served more as "a teaching, training mechanism" than as an unbiased 
attempt to gather information about what each child had actually experienced. 
</P>
<P>
But, without giving specifics, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William 
Pounders said outside the jury's presence that he was "very disappointed in 
Maloney's testimony." The judge said that although the witness "has drawn out 
17 supposed reasons why the system was bad," he found them "inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
Pounders said he had even done research "as to my ability to strike this kind 
of testimony. That's how bad it has been."

CITY MANAGER MOVES TO ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After only a year on the job, El Segundo City Manager Fred Sorsabal is 
resigning to become city manager in Mission Viejo in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Sorsabal, 51, said he will start his new job April 24, replacing William 
Talley, who took a similar job with the city of Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
Sorsabal said his departure was not greatly influenced by the defeat last week 
of two local ballot measures that would have raised new revenues and bailed El 
Segundo out of a financial crisis. The city expects to have a general operating 
deficit of $1.6 million in fiscal 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Sorsabal said, he looks forward to the challenge of managing a city 
that is only a year old. Mission Viejo, whose population of about 70,000 is 
more than four times that of El Segundo's, became a municipality on March 31, 
1988.

MAN ACQUITTED IN ARTIST'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than two days of deliberation, a Pasadena Superior Court jury 
acquitted a Glendale man of charges of murder, rape and burglary in the death 
of an elderly Glendale artist. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo Beltran, 31, sobbed and clutched his attorney's shoulder when the verdict 
was announced Monday. Beltran was charged in the death of Helen Kennedy, who 
was 73 when she was found beaten to death in her Glendale home on Aug. 9, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
During the three-week trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. Tamia Hope argued that 
fingerprints matching Beltran's, found in the room where Kennedy was murdered, 
tied him to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
But Beltran's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Morton Borenstein, argued 
throughout the trial that the fingerprints and other circumstantial evidence on 
which the case against Beltran was based were not sufficient to convict him.

3-YEAR-OLD SHOOTS HIMSELF WITH PISTOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 3-year-old West Covina boy was critically wounded Tuesday when he accidently 
shot himself with an automatic pistol that he found in his mother's bedroom, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Pauline Sandoval, 22, told investigators she left her son in her bedroom while 
she was moving furniture in his room to prepare it for painting when she heard 
a "loud pop" about 9 a.m., West Covina Police Lt. John Schiminski said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, Eric Sarda, was in critical condition at Queen of the Valley Hospital, 
where he was being treated for the single gunshot wound, Schiminski said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandoval said her boyfriend, Christopher Fimbres, 23, who also lives in the 
apartment, left the .25-caliber automatic pistol on a headboard above the bed 
after a prowler was detected a couple of days earlier.

COUNTY TO SEEK STATE AID FOR OFF-ROAD VEHICLE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved applying to the 
state for a $17.5-million grant to build an off-road vehicle park in the Santa 
Clarita Valley. The board made the request contingent upon the project 
satisfactorily passing environmental tests. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental study for the park, proposed for rugged Whitney Canyon, is 
expected to be completed this summer.

SUPERVISORS OK FUNDS FOR 250 WORKERS TO COLLECT PROPERTY TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prodded by taxpayer complaints and county administrators, the county Board of 
Supervisors agreed Tuesday to spend nearly $2 million to hire 250 additional 
workers to speed the processing and collection of local property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors voted to spend the additional funds -- with the bulk of it 
going to the treasurer-tax collector's office -- after county administrators 
warned that the added workers are needed to pull in property tax revenue that 
the board was already counting on. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the supervisors are depending on additional property tax 
revenue for $3.25 million to keep outpatient clinics open in the county's 
financially strapped mental health system. And Assessor John Lynch told the 
board Tuesday that the lack of additional workers could impair the ability to 
collect that revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the lagging collections represent properties that have only recently 
been put on the tax rolls. 
</P>
<P>
Blaming a computer foul-up for errors in an estimated 100,000 property tax 
assessments, Lynch also said he needed an additional 100 temporary workers -- 
at a cost of $750,000 -- to help the department during the next four months. 
</P>
<P>
About $1.2 million of the total amount approved by supervisors will go for 145 
permanent workers in the treasurer-tax collector's office -- which represents a 
60% increase in staffing -- and another seven workers in the 
auditor-controller's office. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum objected to the additional help for the treasurer-tax 
collector's office, questioning why the appropriation request comes "in the 
waning months" of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, however, joined his colleagues in approving the 
additional money after pointing out that he has received an avalanche of 
complaints about snafus in the property tax system. "This is one issue our 
office gets more complaints on than any other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Property taxes make up some 20%, or $1.9 billion, of the county's annual 
budget. There are 2.3 million taxable properties in the county.

LETTERS TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the years, The Times has consistently urged government to invest enough in 
schools, transportation networks and other public services to keep pace with 
California's phenomenal growth. Its hope has been for public services that 
would nurture commerce, industry and people and to protect the unique natural 
resources that make California the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent letter, Gov. George Deukmejian complained that The Times' editorial 
policies call for growth in government programs but never describe where 
government can put its hands on the money necessary to support those programs. 
He challenged The Times to "put up or shut up." It is a fair challenge that The 
Times accepts. 
</P>
<P>
Today's editorial is the first of a series of three in which The Times will 
examine the need for new and expanded programs for schools, universities, 
health care, transportation and all others essential to the state's future. 
Consistent with the challenge, the series will specify the programs that 
California needs to grow and prosper, the cost of the programs and the tax 
increases it would take to finance them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE TIMES' RESPONSE 
</P>
<P>
Fulfilling the Promise 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian is correct when he says that few places on Earth can 
match California's quality of life and opportunities for personal fulfillment. 
But he is wrong when he says that his Administration is maintaining a superior 
level of public services, let alone making the investments that will allow 
California to forge into the 21st Century with a healthy economy and a vibrant 
society. 
</P>
<P>
We will accept Deukmejian's statement that California has enjoyed a 73% 
increase in state revenues and a 65% increase in expenditures during his six 
years in office, roughly tracking the cost of living and population growth. To 
settle for such levels is to relegate California to a constant, losing battle 
of trying to keep up with demands for services and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Never before has California been willing to settle for average. 
</P>
<P>
California's problems do not respect statistical curves and averages such as 
those cited by the governor and imposed by the Gann limits on state spending, 
adopted by voter initiative in 1979. School enrollment is growing faster than 
the general population, and will accelerate in coming years as baby boom 
children move through the system. The prison population has nearly tripled 
since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian budgets, and particularly the 1989-90 budget of $46 billion that was 
the focus of the Feb. 17 editorial to which the governor refers, have scrimped 
on critical programs ranging from a $4.5-billion shortfall in transportation 
spending over the next five years to the governor's proposed elimination of the 
state Office of Family Planning at a saving of $36 million. The family planning 
cut might help balance the budget, but it would cost the state compounded 
millions in coming years. The University of California estimates that every 
dollar invested in family planning saves $6.60 in future social services, 
welfare and health costs. 
</P>
<P>
One reason California is suffering severe financial problems is that voters 
over the years have squeezed the system with initiative measures such as 
Proposition 13 of 1978 and Proposition 4 of 1979, which imposed the Gann 
spending limits. Voters understandably found the opportunity to cut taxes and 
limit spending appealing. They could not know at the time -- judging the 
measures in isolation -- the destructive effect the initiatives ultimately 
would have on public services they count on. 
</P>
<P>
The future provides California with not only the promise of economic growth and 
jobs, but also the chance to develop a unique society of cultural, educational, 
technological and artistic diversity. To do so, California must invest now in 
the necessary public support structure. Few jobs will be created if 
Californians cannot get to them on clogged freeways. Talented people will not 
move to California if they have no hope of buying a house, and many are leaving 
the state now for this reason, not to mention air pollution, congestion and 
others. The new immigrant Californians will not realize their potential if they 
cannot obtain adequate health care or if they have special difficulties making 
their way into and through the public education system. 
</P>
<P>
Government spending is not the solution to all of California's problems. Nor 
are all the current problems Deukmejian's fault. But unless state government 
acts aggressively now to correct the deficiencies of recent years, California 
cannot boast of the services that are essential if the Golden State is to lure 
new businesses and their employees. 
</P>
<P>
As a minimum investment in a program of returning to excellence, The Times 
proposes this basic spending plan, including a state gasoline tax increase and 
about $1.3 billion in new general fund revenues to offset proposed 1989-90 
budget reductions: 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION -- California is suffering a transportation crisis. The proposed 
new budget has a $700-million highway construction and maintenance shortfall, 
and there is a $4.5-billion deficit in the 5-year State Transportation 
Implementation Program of priority projects. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has opposed an increase in the present 9-cent-a-gallon state 
gasoline tax, the traditional and logical source of transportation funds, which 
has been raised only once since 1963 -- by 2 cents in 1982. The California tax 
now is 5 cents a gallon less than the national average, and California ranks 
50th among the states in transportation finance as a proportion of personal 
income. Delays and congestion cost California an estimated $800 million a year 
-- a conservative estimate, some experts contend -- and safety becomes a 
concern as roads deteriorate. There has been no significant expansion of a 
freeway system built for 20 million residents in the late 1960s although the 
state's population has grown by nearly 10 million since then. Transportation 
planners say that freeway speeds in Southern California will decline from an 
average 31 m.p.h. now to 11 m.p.h. by the year 2010 under existing construction 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
The state urgently needs a 10-cent-a-gallon increase in the gasoline tax, 
producing an estimated $15 billion to $20 billion over the next decade. The 
deficit in state transportation finance during that period is expected to be 
about $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION -- California has pumped large amounts of new money into education 
for pupils in kindergarten through the 12th grade during the Deukmejian years. 
And, finally, the improvements are being reflected in slightly better grade 
scores. Still, California spends less per pupil than the national average. 
There are special problems in California because so many of the 140,000 
additional students entering the system each year are immigrant children who 
speak little or no English. Class size is a disgrace: Only Utah burdens its 
teachers with a larger average class size. Teachers need to be paid more. Many 
school districts do not have enough money to buy new texts. Per-pupil spending 
has leveled off, and further improvement in the state's system will be 
difficult or impossible without more money. 
</P>
<P>
California still is known for its excellent higher- education system, but both 
the University of California and California State University are facing 
tremendous problems in maintaining that reputation, with 63,000 additional 
students expected at UC by the year 2005 and 60,000 at Cal State. Part of this 
year's costs would be offset by increasing application fees and student fees at 
both systems. This ought not be done. Also, California's 1.1-million community 
college system must have more money to institute necessary reforms approved by 
the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The Times proposes that the education budget be increased by $412 million to 
restore program reductions, eliminate the student fee increase and to advance 
community college reforms. 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE/SOCIAL SERVICES -- In the past, state budget cuts used to hurt 
mostly poorer Californians. Recently, however, the entire population has 
suffered from the overcrowding, closure or threatened closure of hospital 
emergency rooms and trauma centers for lack of funds, affecting as many as nine 
Los Angeles hospitals at one point last summer. The key element in the health 
safety net in California is the Medically Indigent Services Program through 
which the state helps counties pay the costs of poor people. Measured against 
the medical inflation rate, state financing for this program has declined $474 
million in the past six years. Uncollected hospital charges during 1986-87, the 
last year for which figures are available, exceeded costs by $1.1 billion. Fees 
paid by Medi-Cal, the state-federal program of health care for the poor, are 
compensating doctors -- those who still will treat Medi-Cal patients -- at only 
about 40% of their normal charges, and hospitals, 68% of their costs. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's new budget also would eliminate $272 million in normally routine 
cost-of-living increases in Medi-Cal; county health services; supplemental 
income for the aged, blind, disabled and welfare recipients. The budget for the 
new workfare program, GAIN, has been cut by $65 million. These and other 
reductions should be restored at a cost of $857 million. 
</P>
<P>
GENERAL GOVERNMENT -- Because of the Gann spending limit, government programs 
cannot grow to meet demands and needs. Whenever a program does expand, the 
funds must come from elsewhere in the budget. For one example, with the cost of 
operating the prison system expected to double to $3.1 billion in the next five 
years, other portions of the budget would have to be reduced by $1.5 billion if 
the Gann limits remain in place. This would be devastating to some programs 
that already have been cut back or held static. For example, the state park 
system has the same number of rangers as it did in 1980, even though park 
visits and acreage both have increased by nearly one-third. The new budget 
would increase the pesticide regulation program by only 1.3%. The program to 
investigate and halt ground water contamination would be reduced by $1.8 
million and 27 staff positions would be eliminated. The budget of the 
California Arts Council would be cut 19%, to just $12.6 million. The cost of 
restoring these and other programs would vary and depend on the amount of new 
revenue available. 
</P>
<P>
REVENUE -- The 1989-90 budget cuts can be offset in part by using some of $1 
billion the governor proposes for immediate restoration of the state's 
emergency fund. We would replenish the fund over several years, thus freeing at 
least $500 million for the 1989-90 budget. About $300 million more would be 
raised by conforming state law to the most recent federal tax law changes -- 
something Deukmejian briefly proposed to do last year. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the Legislature should pass a general tax increase such as Senate Bill 
520 sponsored by Sen. Alfred Alquist (D-San Jose) to restore the 11% bracket of 
the state income tax, which was reduced to 9.3% in 1987. The 11% levy, 
applicable only to taxable income of $100,000 or more, would raise at least 
$600 million. 
</P>
<P>
Other major sources of new state funds could be realized without putting an 
undue burden on California taxpayers or the business and corporate community. 
They include the closing of loophole-exemptions in the state sales tax, a 
partial restoration of the inheritance tax, taxing certain services such as 
lawyer's fees, and the creation of a split roll so that businesses could pay a 
higher level of property tax than homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
A modest investment of new revenue in California's future will pay untold 
dividends for years to come. Failure to do so now will mean the state is 
abdicating its reputation for excellence and its tradition of building together 
so the California dream can be a reality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BY THE NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
With one exception, the percentage increase in state spending has declined over 
the past five years (below left), while the state's population has grown at a 
relatively even pace (bottom left). As a result, state spending is spread too 
thin. 
</P>
<P>
 Services do not lag because the state cannot afford them. California's share 
of national income is higher than it was a decade ago (below right). 
</P>
<P>
 The chart at bottom right compares a budget that The Times calculates would 
provide adequate growth in services with the budget proposed by the governor.

<P>
THE GOVERNOR'S LETTER 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian on State Budget 
</P>
<P>
In your editorial "State Budget: Over the Cliff" (Feb. 17), you have once again 
attributed virtually all of California's challenges to what you say is a lack 
of state revenues and to the fact that I won't consent to a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't you inform your readers that over the last six years, we have had a 
73% increase in state tax revenues -- thanks to our strong economy and job 
creation -- and a 65% increase in expenditures? Both increases exceed the 
combined rate of inflation and population growth during that same period. 
</P>
<P>
Our problem is not a lack of revenues. By keeping taxes reasonable, we have 
helped keep prosperity and job creation high, and this growth has brought more 
new, steady revenues into government coffers for public services than any tax 
increase ever could. 
</P>
<P>
California is not falling off a "cliff" or sinking into an "abyss" -- to cite 
just two examples of the hyperventilated phrase-making that has become a staple 
of your "Chicken Little"-style editorials. Virtually the whole world knows that 
when it comes to the quality of life, the level of public services and the 
opportunities for personal fulfillment, few places on Earth can match 
California. 
</P>
<P>
That is why people are leaving other states, some of which are high tax states, 
and beating a path to our door. It is why the job creators and corporate 
decision makers, both foreign and domestic, have made California their No. 1 
favored destination for new investments. And most recently (on Feb. 24), Wall 
Street has expressed renewed confidence in California's underlying fiscal 
health by reissuing our Triple A-bond rating. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, we have challenges and we always strive to be the best. But your endless 
refrain -- more spending, higher taxes -- represents a disproved, discredited 
prescription for mediocrity, and we will never return to that philosophy as 
long as I'm governor. And I am convinced that, come 1990, the people will 
reject any candidate who thinks like you do. 
</P>
<P>
I propose that at the end of each editorial calling for increased spending or 
higher taxes in a given area, you add it to a cumulative total of all new 
spending and taxes you have proposed in a given year and report those totals to 
your readers. In this manner, readers could judge the wisdom of your views not 
just on one isolated issue, but they would be given an opportunity to judge the 
total impact of your views on their wallets and pocketbooks if the state were 
to follow your advice. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, if you feel so strongly about providing state government with 
additional revenues, why wait for the governor and Legislature to raise taxes? 
The Times Mirror Co. reported that it made $332 million last year, after taxes. 
We will gladly accept your voluntary higher tax payments. Simply make your 
checks payable to the "State of California," and send it to my attention. In 
other words -- "put your money where your mouth (or pen) is." Or stated another 
way -- "put up or shut up." I will make sure that your generous contributions 
are deposited into the state's general fund and that your money is wisely 
spent.

PIPE BOMB DISCOVERED AT SCHOOL LUNCH AREA; 
</P>

14-YEAR-OLD STUDENT ARRESTED; AUTHORITIES DON'T SEE ANAHEIM INCIDENT AS LINKED

<P>
A pipe bomb with a remote control detonating device was found above a dining 
area at an Anaheim high school Tuesday shortly before lunch, and a 14-year-old 
student at the school was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb was discovered after the principal at Esperanza High School was tipped 
that the youth had planted a bomb somewhere on a school roof, officials said. 
It was the third bomb-related scare in as many days in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The area, where about 2,250 students eat lunch, was cordoned off for nearly 2 
hours while the Orange County Sheriff's Hazardous Devices Squad removed the 
bomb from the roof and dismantled it, according to Anaheim Police Lt. Jack 
Parra. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
"Had the bomb gone off near some people, it could have caused some serious 
damage," Parra said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they knew of no specific motive for the attempted bombing and 
discounted any direct link to other pipe bomb discoveries in the county earlier 
this week. On Sunday, a fake bomb was found outside an Iranian restaurant in 
Orange, and then on Monday, a small pipe bomb was found in the Santa Ana River 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
The youth, a ninth-grader from Yorba Linda, was taken from class and arrested. 
Parra said that authorities could only speculate about why he may have planted 
the device. 
</P>
<P>
"You always wonder if it's a copycat situation or just a coincidence," Parra 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Capt. Peter De Paola said the boy seemed troubled and may have been 
seeking attention. 
</P>
<P>
"The motive would appear to be peer pressure," De Paola said. "Apparently this 
kid came on campus bragging about it. He might have seen something on TV that 
sparked his interest last night." 
</P>
<P>
The youth was being held Tuesday night at Orange County Juvenile Hall on 
suspicion of felony possession and manufacture of an explosive device, police 
said. His name was withheld because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
The campus was calm afterward, and Principal George Allen said it was fortunate 
that students came to him with the youth's plans in time. 
</P>
<P>
"They had just heard it from another kid that morning," Allen said. "I received 
information on who it was and passed it on to police. Basically, we had the kid 
before police got there." 
</P>
<P>
Allen said he knew of no earlier discipline problems involving the youth. 
</P>
<P>
After the students approached him, Allen said, he and other school officials 
quickly scanned roof tops and spotted the device on a rain shelter above about 
30 lunch benches. Then he called police about 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The youth's mother was called and arrived at the school as police were 
questioning her son, Allen said. The boy was then taken to the Police 
Department for further questioning. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's bomb squad worked from about noon until shortly after 1 p.m. to 
remove and dismantle the device, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources familiar with the bomb's removal, the device contained an 
explosive powder. A wire fuse ran from the bomb to a detonator nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The lunch area where the bomb was found is next to the school's library, 
language arts and science building, according to Joan Stewart, assistant 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
"We just told students that something was on the roof that had to be removed," 
Stewart said. Classes continued on schedule, she said. Students would be told 
about the bomb in their first-period classes today, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin M. Fried, a city councilman in Yorba Linda, said he couldn't believe it 
when he heard the news of the bomb's discovery. 
</P>
<P>
"First the stabbing in Irvine. What is happening to these kids? That sort of 
thing isn't supposed to happen," Fried said. 
</P>
<P>
(Early last Sunday, two high school students in Irvine were stabbed in a fight 
at a fast-food restaurant.) 
</P>
<P>
But Isabelle Hlavac, president of the Board of Education for the Placentia 
Unified School District, pointed out that no school is safe from violence. 
</P>
<P>
"In this day and age, it can happen anywhere and it does," said Hlavac, whose 
board oversees Esperanza High School. "We cannot put our head in the sands. Yet 
we don't want to go into a school and make it a prison, either. We try to stay 
aware."

OIL FIRMS CALL PLAN FOR MCCOLL CLEANUP 'SERIOUSLY FLAWED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Labeling the plan "seriously flawed," a coalition of oil companies Tuesday 
attacked a federal proposal to clean up McColl dump by burning tons of refinery 
wastes and oil-drilling sludge at the eight-acre site in west Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the cleanup options under consideration, the excavation and incineration 
of 150,000 tons of toxic wastes at the abandoned dump would pose the greatest 
health and safety risk to neighboring residents because the process produces 
toxic emissions, a coalition spokesman warned. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Duchie of the coalition, which is known as the McColl Site Group, also 
predicted that pursuing the incineration option would "lead to false hopes in 
the community" and result in litigation that may "delay the cleanup 
indefinitely." 
</P>
<P>
The allegations by representatives of five oil companies were issued at an 
afternoon press conference in Fullerton, several hours before officials of the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state Department of Health 
Services met McColl-area residents across town to outline the incineration 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials believe the oil companies -- Shell, Phillips Petroleum, 
Texaco, Arco and Unocal -- are responsible for the toxic wastes at the World 
War II-era dump, and should pay the cleanup bill before any work begins. 
</P>
<P>
Burning the wastes on site as recommended by the EPA would cost an estimated 
$117 million. The project would take 4 to 7 years to design and implement. 
</P>
<P>
A plan put forth by the oil companies calls for "capping" or "containing" the 
wastes in the ground by covering the 12 contaminated sumps with multiple layers 
of synthetic material and soil approximately 7 feet thick. The option, opposed 
by local, state and federal officials as well as the majority of 1,000 
homeowners who live within half a mile of the former dump, would cost about $22 
million and take 3 to 5 years to implement. The EPA estimates it would cost 
another $500,000 to $1 million annually to monitor the site. 
</P>
<P>
Duchie said the oil companies are motivated by "concern for the community," not 
the cleanup costs, in opposing the incineration plan. 
</P>
<P>
But Betty Porras, who lives behind the dump and heads a citizens group called 
the McColl Dump Action Group, said the oil companies are "worried about the 
bottom line and nothing else." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview before Tuesday night's community meeting, Porras said, "We want 
cleanup, not a cover-up," referring to the oil companies' preference to leave 
the waste in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Porras was one of several dozen residents to question federal and state 
officials at the Fullerton hearing Tuesday night, which was attended by more 
than 350 people. Many of the questions focused on the specifics of the 
incineration, and few expressed approval or disapproval of the concept. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA is not expected to make a final decision on its proposed incineration 
plan until August, and the oil companies acknowledge that they have little 
leverage in shaping that decision, short of stirring up public opposition to 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The oil companies scheduled the press conference because they were were not 
allowed to make a presentation at Tuesday night's meeting, coalition officials 
said. EPA officials said the forum was designed strictly for residents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Metallic Vapors' Cited 
</P>
<P>
In contrast with the EPA's contention that burning the McColl wastes on site 
would probably present little or no risk, the oil companies warned that 
incineration would not completely destroy some of the contaminants buried at 
McColl. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy metals make up a portion of the wastes at the site, said Catherine St. 
Hilaire, an environmental and health risk consultant hired by the oil companies 
to review the EPA plan. She said that heavy metals are not destroyed by 
incineration but become "metallic vapors," which are released into the 
atmosphere through the incinerator exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, St. Hilaire said, the risk of developing cancer from exposure to 
emissions from incineration is "500 times greater" than the risk from leaving 
the wastes in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Incinerator emissions will be deposited on the soil and vegetation of yards 
and gardens and recreational areas," St. Hilaire said. "Contaminated soils, 
vegetables and surface waters can contribute at least as much risk as breathing 
contaminated air." 
</P>
<P>
The EPA contends that burning the waste on site would probably be safe, 
although they have expressed concerns that incinerator emissions may exceed 
local air quality standards. To measure the level and toxicity of emissions, 
the EPA has planned three test burns using McColl waste, including one 
monthlong demonstration burn at the dump itself. 
</P>
<P>
The oil companies' proposal to leave the waste in the ground has been 
questioned because of the potential for contaminants seeping into the ground 
water. St. Hilaire said it is "highly unlikely" that such seepage would occur 
because the cover over the waste would prevent moisture from reaching the 
contaminants and carrying them into the ground water. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drinking Water Not Affected 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged, however, that the issue of ground water contamination near 
McColl must be studied further. 
</P>
<P>
Recent tests of ground water 250 feet below the site show traces of 
sulfur-based chemicals found in the dump. But EPA officials said there is no 
evidence that local drinking water supplies have been contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
The dump sits under a vacant field and part of the Los Coyotes Country Club 
golf course, and is bordered on three sides by expensive homes. It was created 
in the 1940s when oil companies began depositing wastes from the production of 
high-octane military aviation fuel on a vacant patch of land that is now near 
the intersection of Rosecrans Avenue and Sunnyridge Road. Controversy over the 
dump's noxious odors surfaced in the late 1970s. An attempt to dig up the 
sludge and haul it to a landfill in Kern County was halted in May, 1985, by the 
courts, which ordered the state to conduct an environmental impact study. 
</P>
<P>
Duchie said the EPA's incineration plan could lead to similar legal threats, 
again shutting down the cleanup effort. 
</P>
<P>
"If the agency continues on its current path, it will be stopped again just 
like in 1985 by some community surrounding the area that says the risk is too 
great," Duchie said. "They will say, 'We know you don't want the waste, but we 
don't want the risk.' "

$3.3-MILLION FIRE BLACKENS SANTA ANA SKIES; 500 FLEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
A spectacular fire that sent up plumes of smoke visible from all over Orange 
County caused an estimated $3.3 million in damage Tuesday to a Santa Ana 
manufacturer of waste treatment equipment and forced the evacuation of more 
than 500 workers at nearby factories. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported in the fire, which began inside J.L. Wingert Co. at 
2158 S. Hathaway St. about 5:25 p.m., said Sharon Franks, a Santa Ana Fire 
Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Police rerouted commuter traffic around the industrial area near Warner and 
Grand avenues. About 35 firefighters battled the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Hazardous-materials teams were called in from Santa Ana and the Orange County 
Fire Department and the evacuation was ordered because "the potential for this 
being a (major) hazardous fire was very strong," Franks said. 
</P>
<P>
She said fire officials were initially unsure of the type of chemicals stored 
inside the 16,000-square-foot building and feared that the intense flames could 
have spread to nearby firms with large inventories of hazardous chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Hazardous-materials teams were later released, however, after fire officials 
learned that non-hazardous chemicals made up most of what was kept in the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked to the owner, and (a major hazard) didn't seem likely," Franks said 
at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Clements, Wingert's general manager, said he immediately evacuated 
employees. They did not know where the fire had started. The company 
manufactures treatment equipment for hazardous waste, including coolers, sludge 
traps and water treatment mixers. 
</P>
<P>
Workers in the surrounding area said they heard what sound 
</P>
<P>
ed like an explosion before the fire started, but fire officials could not 
immediately confirm that, Franks said. 
</P>
<P>
When the fire began, just five of the 35 employees on the shift were in the 
Wingert building. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said an acrid odor, possibly from burning polyurethane tanks 
manufactured at the business, permeated the area. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Traxel, who works about a block away from the destroyed building, said 
he saw spectacular flames light up the sky and leap at least 30 feet above the 
building's single-story roof. 
</P>
<P>
Many witnesses also said the fire sent thick, black smoke skyward in a 
"chimney-like" plume. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Cujak, who works nearby, described "tons of black smoke going upward, with 
large particles floating in the air and very heavy ashes."

BOARD VOTES TO EXPAND LIQUOR WARNING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors adopted an ordinance Tuesday that expands statewide 
rules requiring businesses selling or serving liquor to post health warnings. 
</P>
<P>
The action means an additional 505 businesses will be required to post warnings 
that consuming alcohol can be dangerous during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred Orange County businesses are already covered by a state law 
adopted by voters in 1986. The state law affects businesses with more than 10 
employees that serve or sell liquor. 
</P>
<P>
The new county ordinance expands the requirement to any business dispensing 
alcohol regardless of the number of employees. However, the board's action only 
affects businesses in the county's unincorporated areas. About half-a-dozen 
cities in Orange County require a similar warning. 
</P>
<P>
County Public Health Director L. Rex Ehling requested the measure, which takes 
effect next month. 
</P>
<P>
As part of Tuesday's unanimous vote, the board approved spending up to $11,000 
to print the signs and enforce the ordinance. The warnings read: "Warning. 
Drinking distilled spirits, beer, coolers, wine and other alcoholic beverages 
during pregnancy can cause birth defects." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ehling said, about 400 babies were born in the county with 
alcohol-related defects, including fetal alcohol syndrome, the leading cause of 
mental retardation in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it is vital we reach as many pregnant mothers as possible and 
alert them to the dangers of drinking during pregnancy," Ehling said. "This is 
an important step to meeting that goal."

POWER FAILURE CAUSES AMTRAK TO RUN LATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rail commuters faced major delays on Amtrak's early morning trains through 
Orange County on Tuesday after a power failure caused switches to fail between 
San Diego and San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
One southbound train and one northbound train were affected, Amtrak officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Monte, an Amtrak reservation sales agent, said that without the switches 
the trains had to reduce speed to 20 m.p.h. for safety. Normally the trains 
travel 65 to 70 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Martin, manager of public affairs for the Santa Fe Railroad, which owns 
the tracks, said the power failure was caused by a break in the main signal 
line in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
The train was an hour and 50 minutes late in Santa Ana and and an hour and 55 
minutes late in Fullerton. It arrived in Los Angeles at 9:30 a.m., an hour and 
a half late. 
</P>
<P>
The switches failed at 5:45 a.m. and were back in service at 8:40 a.m.

TRIAL FOCUSES ON ROLES OF BOMB SQUAD OFFICERS IN THEIR OWN DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The question of whether two Los Angeles police bomb experts caused their own 
deaths has emerged as a matter of dispute in the bomb-blast murder trial of a 
North Hollywood makeup artist. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant, Donald Lee Morse, is charged with two counts of murder and two 
counts of possessing explosives in the officers' deaths, which occurred when 
they tried to dismantle a bomb found in Morse's garage. 
</P>
<P>
Killed in the powerful explosion on Feb. 8, 1986, were Detective Arleigh 
McCree, 46, commander of the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad, and 
Officer Ronald Ball, 43. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Get Life Sentence 
</P>
<P>
If convicted in the San Fernando Superior Court case, which began Monday, 
Morse, 39, a film and television makeup specialist, could be sentenced to life 
in prison without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Without the jury present, Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling E. Norris asked Judge 
John H. Major to prevent Morse's attorney from suggesting during examination of 
witnesses that negligence on the part of the officers contributed to their 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Bernard J. Rosen insisted that he was "not saying there was 
anything negligent that caused the deaths" but added that he planned to 
introduce evidence that "other means could have been used" to handle the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that some experts transport bombs elsewhere, then explode them, and 
that others wear protective clothing when working on bombs. Earlier testimony 
had indicated that McCree and Ball did not wear special clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Norris contended that although Rosen was not using the word negligence he was 
saying the same thing in different words. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repeats Earlier Ruling 
</P>
<P>
Judge Major reiterated a 1988 ruling that negligence was not a defense, but 
said he would rule on evidence as it is presented. 
</P>
<P>
Norris contends that the prosecution need not show that Morse intended to kill 
the officers, only that he possessed an illegal deadly weapon that had no use 
other than to kill. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police went to Morse's home to search for a pistol that had been 
used four days earlier in the shooting of an official of the Makeup Artists and 
Hairstylists Union Local 706, of which Morse was a member. 
</P>
<P>
The gun was not found, and Morse was not charged in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
While searching the house, officers found two pipe bombs and summoned McCree 
and Ball. The two dismantled one bomb but were killed while trying to take 
apart the second. 
</P>
<P>
Police on Monday testified that Morse denied any knowledge of the bombs when 
they were discovered, and said that he had allowed friends to store things in 
his garage. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the denials, police witnesses said that inside Morse's house they found 
shotgun shells, fishing line, rubber straps and gunpowder, all identical to 
contents of the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
In opening arguments, Norris told jurors that he will introduce evidence 
showing that 10 days before the blast Morse had threatened his estranged

LECTURES AT UCI WITH ROSE BIRD; 
</P>
<P>
BORK SAYS STATE GUN LAWS CONSTITUTIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Former appellate Justice Robert H. Bork, the controversial conservative whose 
nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court was rejected by the Senate in 1987, said 
Tuesday that he saw no constitutional barriers to states barring assault 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Bork spoke out on the issue at the Distinguished Lecture Series with former 
California Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not an expert on the second amendment," Bork said about the right to bear 
arms, "but its intent was to guarantee the right of states to form militia, not 
for individuals to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
"But assault weapons could be banned under the Constitution" by states, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a follow-up question after the lecture, Bork was asked whether his statement 
would apply to all gun control. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably," he replied. "It doesn't mean it's a great idea. It's probably 
constitutional." 
</P>
<P>
The two former justices met Tuesday night before an audience of about 4,000 in 
the first of a new series of lectures. Bork had been former President Reagan's 
choice for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Bird was voted out of office by 
California's electorate. 
</P>
<P>
Bork and Bird came at the U.S. Constitution from opposite sides of the 
political spectrum, but both agreed that the courts had been politicized in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now witnessing a war for control of our legal culture, and most 
particularly for control of our Constitution," Bork said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Constitution is the trump card in American politics, and judges decide 
what the Constitution means," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bork blamed "liberals" for imposing a moral and political agenda on the courts 
"that cannot be found in the Constitution and that no legislature will enact." 
</P>
<P>
He argued for a strict adherence to the "original understanding" of the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm simply suggesting to you that those are questions for the American people 
and their representatives and not the courts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bird argued that the courts are faced with an ever-more-complex society that 
the framers of the Constitution could never have envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our founding fathers intended to set down principles. They didn't set 
down a detailed piece of legislation," Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we get into very rigid viewpoints on any of these issues, we begin to 
lose the dynamics of what our system is all about," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The framers could never have envisioned multinational corporations, blood 
testing or lie detectors, she said: "If you look at the right to privacy in a 
rural, rustic society and look at downtown Los Angeles, there cannot be, I 
think, a rigid idea that is given by some god to our founding fathers that we 
then follow rigidly today." 
</P>
<P>
Bork, however, argued that "once you say you don't know what principles they 
(the framers of the Constitution) were laying down, then you have nothing left 
to guide you except your own preferences. And you ought not to be making up the 
law according to your own preferences." 
</P>
<P>
On how the courts have been politicized, Bird pointed to reapportionment and 
said that once there were major decisions in the area of redistricting, 
politicians realized that they needed sympathetic judges on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
The two were brought together for the exchange with a $50,000 matching grant 
from the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
James Stofan of UCI's Alumni Assn. said Bird and Bork were "excited" about the 
lecture "because it's the first time they've been on the same stage." 
</P>
<P>
Since her defeat in one of the most bitter judicial elections in U.S. history, 
Bird has been a commentator for KABC-TV. Bork resigned from the appellate bench 
and is a lecturer.

EX-COACH IS SENTENCED TO PROBATION IN MOLESTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former varsity basketball coach and teacher in Anaheim was ordered Tuesday to 
serve 5 years' probation after admitting last year that he had sexually 
molested two 16-year-old students. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown's sentence of Christopher M. Lee, 42, of 
Newport Beach marked a partial trade-off in the severity of punishment, since 
Lee avoided any further jail time but got a probationary period that was longer 
than the standard 3 years. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathleen M. Kendle, who had sought a sentence 
of a year in County Jail, said she was "extremely disappointed" with Brown's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It took an awful lot of courage for these particular students to come 
forward," Kendle said of the two Esperanza High School students who reported 
Lee's repeated sexual activities with them to a school counselor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Teacher 
</P>
<P>
The girls suffered "intense peer pressure and ostracism" at school for 
reporting a popular teacher, and "they deserved more than this sentence after 
what they've been through," Kendle said. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown, in ordering probation for Lee, pointed to the "unusual 
circumstances" in the case -- an apparent reference to Lee's unblemished 
history as a respected and well-liked English teacher and varsity basketball 
coach at Esperanza and as a community member in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Lee has already spent 40 days confined in a state institution for a diagnostic 
review by mental health professionals. Brown indicated to the attorneys at a 
conference before the sentencing that he saw no need for any further 
imprisonment, the attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee refused any comment on the case as he left the Santa Ana courthouse after 
his sentencing. His attorney, Ronald G. Brower, pleased with the outcome, said: 
"Any more jail time would have been too severe. He has already certainly 
suffered public humiliation from the publicity that attended this case." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Working as Supervisor 
</P>
<P>
Now working as a supervisor at a construction firm, Lee has no plans to contest 
the formal loss of teaching certification that will follow Tuesday's criminal 
sentencing, Brower said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides serving a 5-year probation sentence, Lee will have to register with the 
state as a sex offender and is barred from contact with minors unless another 
adult is present. He may also have to make restitution to the victims for the 
financial expenses they have incurred as a result of the molestation -- such as 
psychiatric treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Both victims are undergoing continued counseling to deal with the trauma of the 
experience, prosecutor Kendle said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee pleaded guilty last fall to charges that he had repeated sexual relations 
with the two students -- both in school and out -- over a period of several 
months in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In his interviews with state mental health professionals, Lee could give no 
explanation for his conduct, according to prosecutor Kendle. His attorney has 
previously described the episode as a single moment of "human frailty" on Lee's 
part, "an extreme lapse in judgment."

KRAFT DISPLAYS A RARE BURST OF TEMPER AT HIS 16-COUNT MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Randy Steven Kraft, who has remained calm throughout his 9-month trial on 
charges of killing 16 young men, displayed a rare burst of frustration Tuesday 
during arguments over what evidence the jurors should hear about the first 
victim's death. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown argued repeatedly that much of the defense's 
information pointing to other potential suspects in the 1972 death of Camp 
Pendleton Marine Edward Daniel Moore was irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
In once instance, Kraft attorney C. Thomas McDonald wanted jurors to know that 
authorities found a portrait in Moore's locker of a Long Beach man. The defense 
claims that man may have hired Marines to pose for him. 
</P>
<P>
"So what?" Brown asked Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin outside the 
presence of the jury. "Assuming all that is true . . . it doesn't have anything 
to do with this case." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kraft's Eyes Widened 
</P>
<P>
Kraft's eyes widened and he spoke to McDonald in a shouted whisper audible to 
the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"So what? So what (it matters) to me," Kraft said, pointing to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, 43, a Long Beach computer consultant, has been linked by prosecutors to 
a total of 45 murders in Southern California, Oregon and Long Beach. If Kraft 
is found guilty of any of the 16 murder charges, the other killings could be 
used by prosecutors at a penalty hearing where they sought a death verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft was arrested on May 14, 1983, after two California Highway Patrol 
officers found a dead Marine, 25-year-old Terry Lee Gambrel, in the front 
passenger seat of his car. The 16 charges date back to the death of Moore, who 
was found on a freeway off-ramp in Seal Beach on Dec. 26, 1972. Moore, like 
several of the 45 people Kraft is accused of killing, was found with a sock 
inserted in a body cavity. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald wanted to present evidence that Moore had a homosexual relationship 
with another man and that prosecutors found a pile of single socks in the man's 
trailer. 
</P>
<P>
Judge McCartin, over the prosecution's objections, permitted the defense to let 
jurors hear about the homosexual relationship. But the judge said the search 
information was irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald said later: "I thought it was relevant. We've had so many socks in 
this case, how could that not be relevant?" 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Brown has continuosly objected to defense evidence he contends is 
designed to throw the jurors off the track. For example, Brown said that the 
picture of the Long Beach man found in Moore's locker was meaningless "unless 
we're saying that anyone who has had sexual contact with one of the victims in 
this case is prime to be brought in automatically . . . and that is just not 
the case." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Can I Just Flip the Coin' 
</P>
<P>
McDonald did not give up. 
</P>
<P>
"Can I just flip the coin here for a moment?" he said. "What if within the 
locker was a picture of Mr. Kraft? Would the prosecution be allowed to present 
that to the jury?" 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Brown countered, "Yes, because of other evidence linking Mr. Kraft, 
which in our opinion is overwhelming." The judge agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Although prosecutors have no physical evidence linking Kraft to Moore's death, 
the entry "EDM" was found on a list in Kraft's car, in his handwriting, which 
prosecutors claim is Kraft's own death list. Brown also considers the sock 
strong evidence. Also, Moore was found in an area Brown claims was "Kraft's 
favorite dumping ground"; he was strangled like most of the other victims in 
the case and he had been re-dressed after death, as were some of the others. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, however, contends that the list found in Kraft's car is meaningless 
and that the rest of the evidence cannot be linked to his client. 
</P>
<P>
Although Moore is the last of the 16 victims discussed by the defense before 
the jury, McDonald told the court he still has 19 witnesses and cannot 
guarantee he can meet the judge's tentative timetable of completing the defense 
by Easter. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft has not testified and McDonald refused to say whether his client will 
take the witness stand. But he did tell the court that he must meet with Kraft 
privately to determine whether the defense will put on anyone besides the 19 he 
mentioned.

HARD WORKER HAD MADE WAY AMONG DEMOCRATS; 
</P>
<P>
PARTY TURNS FROM FELON IN ITS MIDST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Democratic leaders are attempting to distance themselves from a 
convicted felon who later won a place in local party organizations through 
"hard work," and even got himself elected to a state Democratic Party 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
"In politics you're always looking for people who will work hard and produce," 
county Democratic activist Chris Townsend said Tuesday. Townsend, former 
president of Orange County's Democratic Associates, said the man, Howard O. 
Kieffer, "was very hard-working." 
</P>
<P>
Kieffer, 33, a marketing consultant who resides in Trabuco Canyon, was indicted 
by a federal grand jury in January on charges of defrauding the government and 
filing fake income tax returns that netted him $212,000 in refunds. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Kieffer was convicted of two counts of felony grand theft, including 
fraudulently purchasing airline tickets and illegally deeding himself a house 
that he used as collateral for a loan. When the loan was foreclosed, the actual 
owner, a widow, was forced to give up the home to pay for it, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
County Democratic Party Chairman Mike Balmages said the controversy over 
Kieffer has been embarrassing to the party but said he was not sure what else 
could have been done. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Guidelines 
</P>
<P>
"There are no proscribed rules or guidelines on how to handle something like 
this," Balmages said. "When allegations surface, you automatically get American 
feelings that a person is innocent until proven guilty . . . you do nothing 
until the allegations are proven to be true. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, Howard has apparently been convicted of something, and that 
is troubling because you do want to distance yourself as a party from people 
whose integrity is in question." 
</P>
<P>
Kieffer, while refusing comment on the previous or current criminal cases, said 
Tuesday that only a few of his Democratic friends had spurned him in the wake 
of his legal troubles. 
</P>
<P>
"When the indictment was first announced, I received in the first weekend 
probably 150 phone calls." Kieffer said. "It was 5 or 6 days before I received 
my first negative phone call, and then there were only two." 
</P>
<P>
He added that while he awaits trial, "Life goes on and you can't just crawl in 
a hole and hide. . . . I can't do that. I just have to hold my head up." 
</P>
<P>
Kieffer ran the Laguna Hills regional office that provided get-out-the-vote and 
voter registration services for presidential contender Michael S. Dukakis and 
other Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm a good organizer, and I think I'm known as somebody who gets 
things done," Kieffer said. 
</P>
<P>
After stories of his indictment and previous convictions were published, 
Kieffer was asked in February to resign from the board of the associates, a 
Democratic Party support group. When he did not, he was removed, Townsend said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the nature of felonies he had pled guilty to, it would be 
inappropriate for him to remain on the board, which has fiduciary 
responsibility of the organization," Townsend said. 
</P>
<P>
Kieffer said he did not resign because his term was to have ended in a week in 
any case. 
</P>
<P>
Kieffer also was an alternate on the county Democratic Central Committee. He 
was recently removed from that spot by the man who had appointed him, Howard 
Greenebaum, who unsuccessfully challenged Rep. Ron C. Packard (R-Carlsbad) in 
last November's election. 
</P>
<P>
Kieffer also has, in effect, been removed from his spot on South Orange 
County's 70th Assembly District Committee, to which he was elected at the state 
Democratic Party convention last month. The election was subsequently called 
into question because of allegations that people ineligible to vote had 
participated. New elections have been ordered for Kieffer's post as well as 
officers of the district committee.

BOOKER SEEMS BOUND TO DRAW CRITICISM FOR PADRE FAMILY TIES 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They lived just around the corner from one another in Burlington, N.C. They 
attended kindergarten together, played together as children, grew up together. 
</P>
<P>
He pitched baseballs with her brothers, ransacked her kitchen cabinets for junk 
food, hung around her house late at night and bugged her when she returned home 
from dates. 
</P>
<P>
One day, just before his junior year in college, he visited her while she was 
working at a Burger King and suddenly, it was different. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like, she even looked good in a Burger King suit," Greg Booker recalled 
of Kristi McKeon. "I had to say it: 'So when are we going out?' " 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen months later, the lifetime friends became husband and wife. He was a 
marginal first base prospect who had just joined the San Diego Padres 
organization. She came from a baseball family, and understood about the trips 
and late nights and the pressure. Together, it was going to be fine. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like any two kids in love," Booker recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Only, you know what they say about love. Blind to the fact that Kristi's father 
was a baseball executive, blind to the fact that Booker happened to be in that 
same organization and might one day . . . Well, Greg Booker and Kristi McKeon 
never dreamed about what a fine mess this marriage would make. 
</P>
<P>
For the last six years, since he joined the Padres at the end of the 1983 
season, Booker has had to cope with one of the most precarious and unusual and 
sometimes cruel positions in baseball. Not as a long relief pitcher but as a 
son-in-law of the Padres' former general manager and now manager, Jack McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
Because he is no superstar -- he has a 5-6 career record with a 3.76 earned-run 
average -- it is a relationship that fans and players never let him forget. 
</P>
<P>
"(The fans) are always on him, always about the same stuff, about how he 
wouldn't be here if his father didn't run the club," said Tony Gwynn, Booker's 
teammate and close friend. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the whispers from the Padre clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Even people in this room have said some things," Gwynn said. "Sure as I'm 
standing here, I've heard some things. 
</P>
<P>
"Players say, 'Booker is here because Jack won't let his daughter starve.' You 
hear that time and again." 
</P>
<P>
Booker, 6-foot-6 and 245 pounds, is as sensitive as he is big but says he has 
learned to deal with most of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm under a microscope, and that every thing I do will be judged by my 
relationship with Jack, and I can handle it," he said. "But what I don't get 
is, they really think someone would marry and have two kids and go through all 
trials just because they just wanted to play major league baseball? Do they 
really think I went through the National League Green Book looking for general 
managers with daughters?" 
</P>
<P>
Booker had his best year last summer, going 2-2 with a 3.39 ERA and 43 
strikeouts with just 19 walks. He even made a pair of impressive starts at the 
end, and will be counted upon this season as perhaps a right-handed stopper and 
emergency starter. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he is still without peace. 
</P>
<P>
"It's because it doesn't go away, the talk and bad remarks don't go away," 
Booker said softly. "I thought if I pitched well, that would be it, I would 
never hear about it again. I was wrong. It seems like it will never go away." 
</P>
<P>
Three reasons Booker and McKeon have been accused of nepotism: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Booker was signed to his first pro contract in 1981 by McKeon's son Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- After just two full seasons in the minor leagues, with a record of 15-22, 
and an ERA of 5.87, Booker was recalled by the Padres in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 -- From 1984-86, Booker was recalled each year after racking up ERAs of 5.25 
or more at triple-A Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Three reasons nepotism seems like a silly charge: 
</P>
<P>
 -- When Booker was signed by the Padres, he was not yet engaged to Kristi, 
they were just dating. And although he was signed as a first baseman, McKeon 
insisted that he pitch, which he had never done before, leading to his early 
struggles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- McKeon has never negotiated Booker's contract, ordering it to be handled by 
another club official. When that other official was then-president Chub Feeney 
in the spring of 1988, Booker was offered a 20% pay cut and eventually settled 
for a $5,000 raise. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shortly after McKeon took over as manager in the middle of last season, 
Booker became a bullpen non-person. He made 23 relief appearances in the 
season's first 74 games, and just eight in the next 72. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line with Book is, it's hard to verify that he hasn't had special 
treatment, or that he has had special treatment," Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Booker, ever honest, doesn't know whether he has been given special treatment. 
He says he's never asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It has never crossed my mind to ask Jack, I've always had too much respect for 
him," Booker said. 
</P>
<P>
Such ado about something so simple. Booker dated only one other girl before 
Kristi, who, after their first date, had Booker hooked. 
</P>
<P>
"I took Kristi to see the horror movie 'Prom Night' so maybe she would get 
scared and sit closer to me," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The next summer in Walla Walla, Wash., he and Kristi decided to marry, at which 
time he finally had his first good talk with the man who would later be his 
boss. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't understand, when I was growing up around Kristi I never saw Jack 
because he was always gone away with baseball," Booker said. "I never even 
thought about his job, even after I signed with his team, because he was so 
high on the ladder, and I was so low." 
</P>
<P>
Booker tried to keep his engagement a secret, but it soon leaked out among his 
rookie league teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"And there it started, all the jokes about how I didn't have to worry about 
anything," Booker remembers. "Looking back, that's one reason I struggled so 
much, because I felt I had to prove I could make the big leagues on my own. I 
was trying to throw every ball 100 m.p.h., and I didn't have a clue." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe if Booker had remained a first baseman, or if he had progressed faster as 
a pitcher . . . 
</P>
<P>
"That's the problem, that I'm not a superstar, that I'm always scuffling," 
Booker said. "You're a superstar, people forget. Look at Cal Ripken." 
</P>
<P>
Today, in the clubhouse, Booker and McKeon handle things as player and manager. 
</P>
<P>
But off the field, Booker is the father of two of McKeon's grandchildren, and 
the handyman around the McKeon house. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll come over once every couple of weeks, and bring the grandkids, and I'll 
caulk the bathtub or fix holes in the wall," Booker said. "We never talk 
baseball. We sit around and laugh and shoot the bull about everything else. 
That's why Jack is such a great father-in-law." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon said: "And Book is a great son-in-law. He takes care of my daughter and 
grandchildren like nobody else." 
</P>
<P>
Nice, traditional words. If only for Greg Booker it were that easy.

CHAMPIONS CUP MEN'S TENNIS TOURNAMENT;

<P>
TOUGHEST TRICK FOR VAN RENSBURG IS STAYING FIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first thing Christo van Rensburg has going for him is, of course, his name. 
He should be a rich playboy, bronzing himself on his luxury liner in the 
Mediterranean, with a name like that. 
</P>
<P>
But to Miloslav Mecir, who is both a friend as well as an occasional member of 
the audience, Van Rensburg has another name: Magic. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the things Christo van Rensburg does best are hitting tennis balls and 
burning handkerchiefs. 
</P>
<P>
This is something of an unusual combination, but then it seems to suit the 
26-year-old South African. 
</P>
<P>
"After dinner when I'm with my friends and we're having coffee, I'll take a 
handkerchief and burn it," Van Rensburg said. 
</P>
<P>
The trick is that the handkerchief displays no burn marks. That is, if nothing 
goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
How would you like your handkerchief? Well done? Certainly, monsieur. 
</P>
<P>
Van Rensburg certainly looks like a magician. His hair is spiked high on top in 
something of a frightened look, as if he had just stuck his finger in a light 
socket, or perhaps sawed someone in half by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The best trick Van Rensburg performs is not making a tennis ball disappear 
after crossing the net. It is his famous multiplying-Ping-Pong-balls trick and 
it goes like this: 
</P>
<P>
Van Rensburg holds a Ping-Pong ball in one hand. He closes his hand and there 
are two balls. He closes his hand and voila, there are three balls. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful trick," Van Rensburg said. "It's wonderful because it's hard 
and sometimes it doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
The bane of all magicians, whether they be full-time or part-time like Van 
Rensburg, is making a mistake. Every magician does it on occasion, though, even 
the great ones. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw David Copperfield live once and he flopped a trick," Van Rensburg said. 
"I felt really good." 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Van Rensburg has known only success in his career of prestidigitation, 
he is making yet another comeback from injury in tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Van Rensburg has a history of disk problems. He hurt his back the first time in 
a qualifying match for the 1985 Lipton tournament when he hit a serve and 
couldn't straighten up. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in a doubles match at the 1987 French Open, Van Rensburg really got hurt. 
Once again he hit a serve and could not stand upright. Attendants brought a 
stretcher onto the court and stood it on end. Van Rensburg sort of leaned into 
it and was then carried off the court. 
</P>
<P>
He missed 10 weeks of play. Then he also missed the hardcourt season, his 
specialty, for the second consecutive year because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
Van Rensburg's ranking, which had dropped to 58, rose to as high as No. 19 in 
February. He is now No. 38. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Fishbach, who is Van Rensburg's coach, said there may be just one factor 
that can affect his client. 
</P>
<P>
"If he stays healthy, he'll have a very good year," Fishbach said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Rensburg is the only player to have won a set from Boris Becker this year. 
He won his first-round match Tuesday, beating Lawson Duncan, 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Moore, with whom Van Rensburg stays on his trips to the desert, said he has 
seen magic in Van Rensburg's preparation. 
</P>
<P>
"He is one of the most meticulous, most methodical guys I've seen," Moore said. 
"Now, he's really working on his singles." 
</P>
<P>
Van Rensburg is better known as a doubles specialist. The last three 
tournaments that Van Rensburg teamed with Paul Annacone, they have won twice 
and reached the final of the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you do something really remarkable in singles, people are going to 
remember him for doubles," Fishbach said. 
</P>
<P>
Unless, of course, Van Rensburg devotes more time to his hobby. 
</P>
<P>
When he was in Melbourne for the Australian Open, Van Rensburg did his trick 
with the Ping-Pong balls on a television show. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't that difficult, Van Rensburg said. He has enough tricks up his sleeve 
that he could perform nonstop magic on stage for an hour. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, though, Van Rensburg's stage is movable. 
</P>
<P>
In the players' lounge at tournaments, in his hotel room or after dinner in a 
restaurant, he will cut a rope in half and join it together again. He will form 
a newspaper into a cone, fill it with water and make the water disappear. 
</P>
<P>
If he felt like it, he could cut someone in half, but he said the equipment is 
too heavy to carry. Van Rensburg carries the rope trick, the handkerchief trick 
and the newspaper trick with him when he travels. 
</P>
<P>
In the second round, he will play Andre Agassi. Van Rensburg can probably use a 
little magic in that one. Perhaps he can pull a big serve out of a hat or 
something.

SCOTT OSTLER: THE WORLD OF SPORTS IS A PERFECT ARENA FOR A MOUTHWASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the spirit of spring cleaning, a state college in Michigan works up an 
annual list of words and phrases recommended for banishment from the language. 
</P>
<P>
I read about this in Jack Smith's column in View. The school's banishment 
committee puts the kiss of death on words or phrases misused or overused. Or, 
as we might say in the sports world, words that are misused wrongly or overused 
too often. 
</P>
<P>
The committee overlooked sports, a fertile field of linguistic manure. So roll 
in the dumpster, boys. The envelopes, please. 
</P>
<P>
Transition game has to go. Why not give the up-tempo style of basketball a 
catchy name, like fast break, or running game? 
</P>
<P>
The dictionary says transition is "changing from one state, form, activity, or 
place to another." Running from one end of the court might qualify as 
transition, but barely. It's like my wife asking me, "Honey, will you 
transition down to the store and pick up some milk?" 
</P>
<P>
Transition is too grand a word for basketball, unless a team actually changes 
its molecular structure, something only Michael Jordan has been able to do. Or 
if the team, during the course of a fast break, completes a major trade. 
</P>
<P>
Please, players and media, no more talking about how a team can control its own 
destiny. Again, my trusty dictionary tells me that destiny is predetermined or 
inevitable. If you can control your own destiny, it's not your destiny. 
</P>
<P>
Road trip is a phrase reeking of redundancy, but we should keep it, even though 
there's no such thing as a home trip. Trip, used alone, has the connotation of 
a fun-type vacation, an unfortunate fall, or an experience with LSD. A road 
trip can incorporate all those elements, of course, but I think we need to 
differentiate. 
</P>
<P>
Foot speed is fast gaining in popularity, because broadcasters and coaches like 
to sound erudite, showing off their brain speed. It is my observation that an 
athlete's foot speed is invariably identical to his knee speed or his nose 
speed, and that the speeds of various body parts can be neatly lumped under the 
umbrella term speed. If a guy has great foot speed but poor upper-body speed, 
he's going to fall over backward a lot. 
</P>
<P>
Players and teams today like to stay within their comfort zone. I don't know 
what this means. Is it a hammock? Comfort zone is an example of psychobabble, 
unless it refers to an actual roped-off area where no pesky autograph-seekers 
or reporters are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I myself subscribe to the theory of John Donne, that no man is a 
comfort zone. In the same vain vein, players today frequently tell you, I try 
to play within myself. The hard part, I would guess, is swallowing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Hand-eye coordination is a legit term, but if an athlete has plain old 
coordination, it's likely that this attribute will encompass his eyes and 
hands. Maybe we need to expand the concept. An outfielder who is off and 
running at the crack of the bat, for example, has great foot-ear coordination. 
</P>
<P>
And we could say Mike Tyson has great hand-eye coordination if we're referring 
to Mike's hand and his opponent's eye. 
</P>
<P>
An oft-used redundancy is successful surgery. Too wordy. After all, what does 
successful surgery mean? It means the patient lived. To paraphrase Patrick 
Henry, call it surgery, or call it death. 
</P>
<P>
This one will die hard: velocity. Players and announcers love the world because 
it has four syllables. It is used to describe a pitcher's fastball, or 
velocityball. Velocity should be used only when referring to a velocipede, 
which is an early bicycle propelled by the rider pushing his feet along the 
ground. Velocipeders, by the way, developed great foot speed. 
</P>
<P>
As a sportswriter, maybe I'm oversensitive to this one, but can we please junk 
the phrase blown out of proportion? It is used by athletes and coaches to 
describe the central angle of any story they don't like, ie: "That story about 
me hijacking the jumbo jet full of orphans was blown out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
I prefer to think of such story angles as being blown into proportion. 
</P>
<P>
Another puzzling sportism, used mostly in baseball, is the phrase: What goes 
around, comes around. Apparently this is a principal of quantum physics 
discovered either by Einstein or by Fred the merry-go-round operator. It is 
used by a player who has just been dusted off at the plate or gouged by a 
spikes-high baserunner, and it is uttered as a wish of bad karma upon the 
perpetrator. I prefer the old-fashioned he'll get his. 
</P>
<P>
Please, coaches and players, no more reference to a football opponent as a 
physical football team. This is like referring to a collegiate chess team as a 
cerebral chess team. Tell us a football team is cerebral, or metaphysical, or 
horticultural, but let's not get physical. 
</P>
<P>
That's it for now. There are probably lots of phrases I'm forgetting, but all I 
can do is go out and give it 110%.

The Raiders are expected to sign former All-Pro linebacker Otis Wilson, a free 
agent left unprotected by the Chicago Bears, to a multiyear contract today. No 
terms have been announced, but it is known the Raiders have topped the $1.1 
million Wilson was to receive from Chicago over the next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, 31, will be starting his 10th season in the NFL, but he didn't play a 
down last year because of a knee injury suffered in the exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have signed linebacker Joe Costello, 28, a veteran of three years 
with the Atlanta Falcons, one year in the Canadian Football League and two 
years in the United States Football League. 
</P>
<P>
Costello, 6-3, 245, spent the last three seasons with the Falcons, playing in 
29 games and starting four, working at inside and outside linebacker and on 
special teams.

THIS COULD BE THE SEASON EL DORADO WINS THE BIG ONE: A SOUTHERN SECTION TITLE

<P>
Will this finally be the year that El Dorado High School wins a Southern 
Section baseball title? 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado has come close several times in Coach Steve Gullotti's nine seasons, 
advancing to the championship game in 1981 and reaching the semifinals in two 
of the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, El Dorado was the top-seeded team entering the 5-A division playoffs 
but was upset by Beverly Hills, 13-11, in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
"We still haven't won the big one," Gullotti said. "There are so many variables 
involved that make it so difficult to a single-elimination tournament. You play 
one bad game or face one hot pitcher and you're out." 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado would appear to have another team capable of challenging for the 
championship. Six returning position players, a solid pitching staff and a 
quality transfer certainly sets El Dorado a notch above the top teams in Orange 
County entering the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
"They're men playing with boys," said Esperanza Coach Mike Curran, who has led 
Esperanza to three consecutive appearances in the large-school division 
championship. "There isn't a weakness on the team." 
</P>
<P>
A look at the top teams: 
</P>
<P>
1. EL DORADO 
</P>
<P>
The pitching staff includes Matt Luke, who threw a no-hitter on Saturday 
against Servite, and Pete Janicki, who was 7-2 as a junior but has pitched only 
once this season because of an infected lung. 
</P>
<P>
"We're solid all the way around," Gullotti said. "We have five pitchers who 
will probably pitch past their high school careers." 
</P>
<P>
Gullotti says Jay Hassel, a 6-foot-3, 195-pound right-hander, has a very good 
shot at being drafted. Travis Dowdell is being recruited by Brigham Young 
University. Shane Borowski is another returning pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Hawks are solid up the middle with shortstop Phil Nevin, who has 
signed with Cal State Fullerton, and catcher Bruce Petillo. Nevin hit two home 
runs Monday night in a 6-5 victory over Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Hefft, a 6-2, 190-pound senior, transferred from Whittier Christian and 
starts at third base. 
</P>
<P>
"You will hardly ever see this many college and pro prospects on a public high 
school team," Gullotti said. "My biggest concern has been our defense. We 
haven't made the routine plays, but that will come." 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado is 5-2 with losses to El Toro and Ocean View by 2-1 scores. The team 
batting average was .360 and the staff earned-run average was under 1.00 
entering this week. 
</P>
<P>
2. MATER DEI 
</P>
<P>
Last year's No. 1 team is also rich in pitching with Tony Pena the ace of the 
staff. Pena, 10-1 as a junior, is one of four returning pitchers who combined 
for a winning percentage of .840 last season when the Monarchs finished 21-4. 
</P>
<P>
"Pena is our No. 1 pitcher, and we'll go as far as he takes us," said Bob 
Ickes, Mater Dei's coach. "But I wouldn't trade my staff for anybody's." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Corliss, the team's No. 4 pitcher last season, has moved up to No. 2. 
"He's really improved," Ickes said. "He's got greater command of his pitches 
and added some speed to his fastball." 
</P>
<P>
Among the top returning position players is Ickes' son, Rob, at catcher and the 
double-play combination of Jason Gill at second base and Lionel Hastings at 
shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei's all-star outfield of Jim Austin, Mike Basse and Larry Sutton, who 
earned Division I scholarships, has graduated but Ickes turned infielders Juan 
Zarate and Greg Carl into outfielders to fill the gap. 
</P>
<P>
Carl is the team's top hitter and leads in on-base percentage from his leadoff 
position. Third baseman Jeff Ciccarella has at least one hit in all of of the 
Monarchs' games so far. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei won the Newport-Mesa tournament and has lost only to Capistrano 
Valley in the second game of a season-opening doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
3. WESTMINSTER 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Ryan Klesko, a three-year varsity starter, is ranked among the 
top seniors in the nation on most scouting reports. Klesko, 6-3, 225, batted 
.462 as a junior with seven home runs and 33 runs batted in. He has hit 11 
career homers. 
</P>
<P>
Klesko also has compiled a 13-6 record in three seasons on the mound, but the 
left-hander will be limited to playing first base this season after suffering 
an arm injury. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans Brian Stubbs and Brett Grebe and newcomer Jeff Lyons should fill the 
void in Klesko's absence. 
</P>
<P>
Grebe started slowly last year with a 8.56 earned-run average in his first 18 
innings of work, but he had a 2.02 ERA in his last 34 innings. He finished 7-3 
with a 1.95 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions averaged three errors per game last year, but should be improved 
defensively with shortstop Chris Larson and second baseman Brent Heredia 
returning. Jim Slagle is the only returning starter in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster advanced to the championship game of the El Segundo tournament 
where it lost to unbeaten Artesia, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
4. OCEAN VIEW 
</P>
<P>
Steve Barrett has replaced veteran Bill Gibbons as the Seahawks' coach. Barrett 
compiled a 34-6 record in two seasons as the school's freshman coach. Barrett 
inherits an experienced infield headed by third baseman Gary Christopherson. 
</P>
<P>
Christopherson batted .380 with five homers last year and Barrett said he 
thinks the two-time all-league performer is the best player in the Sunset 
League. 
</P>
<P>
"He got three hits against us and looked great," Laguna Hills Coach Jack Hodges 
said. "He's slimmed down a little and is a lot stronger." 
</P>
<P>
All-league second baseman Steve Hernandez and his brother, Daniel, at shortstop 
give Ocean View a good double-play combination. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching is the team's question mark. Senior right-hander Brent Woken, 
sophomore left-hander Randy Karliner and Keith Herrell, the top pitcher on the 
junior varsity, are expected to be the team's top pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View won the consolation championship in the Loara tournament. The 
Seahawks have victories over Laguna Hills, Los Alamitos and El Dorado. 
</P>
<P>
5. LAGUNA HILLS 
</P>
<P>
Three players -- center fielder Chris Sheff, catcher Mike Helm and 
pitcher-first baseman Rob Milo -- begin their fourth season on the varsity. 
Sheff was among the county leaders with 23 stolen bases last year. 
</P>
<P>
Helm has moved from shortstop to catcher and Hodges said the experiment was a 
good move. "He came to me and suggested the idea because he knew we would be 
short at catcher," Hodges said. 
</P>
<P>
Milo, hampered by back spasms, has pitched only one inning and Hodges said his 
status is "day to day." The Hawks' staff has been set back with injuries to ace 
Ron Kortman (minor arm surgery) and Matt Maffei (academic ineligibility). 
</P>
<P>
"Kortman pitched his first game last week and struck out 10 in seven innings," 
Hodges said. "We should get Maffei back in three weeks. In the mean time, Kevin 
Lovinger has been doing a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Jason Thompson, who hit .380 last season, is the team's cleanup 
hitter. Laguna Hills has five left-handed hitters in the batting order. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills lost to champion Lakewood and consolation champion Ocean View in 
the Loara tournament. 
</P>
<P>
6. EL TORO 
</P>
<P>
Three sophomore pitchers -- Brad Hulse, Ryan Filbeck and Rob Johnson -- have 
been pleasant surprises for Coach Don DeLeon, who led El Toro to the 3-A 
division title game after finishing third in the South Coast League last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Hulse pitched five strong innings in a 2-1 victory over El Dorado in the title 
game of the Loara tournament. Filbeck has yet to allow a run in eight innings 
and Johnson has a win and a save. The staff ERA is 0.75. 
</P>
<P>
"It's conceivable that we'll be going with three sophomores and a junior on the 
mound this year," DeLeon said. 
</P>
<P>
DeLeon has five position players returning, led by shortstop Sean Drinkwater. 
Drinkwater is the best defensive shortstop in the county. Bo Haley has moved 
from left field to third base and was voted the top defensive player in the 
Loara tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Scott Miller and outfielder Greg Miller also return. The Chargers have 
struggled with a .160 team batting average, but DeLeon isn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
"The hitting will come," he said. "We concentrated on defense and pitching in 
our early practices. Haley will be a force before the season is over." 
</P>
<P>
7. IRVINE 
</P>
<P>
Pitching is the name of the game for Irvine. David Goldstein, John Bretza, 
Kevin Obergfell and Mike Seal form one of the best staffs in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein pitched well against El Dorado in the Loara tournament, but allowed 
seven runs on three home runs. "Three swings and they had seven runs," Coach 
Bob Flint said. "Otherwise, he pitched well very." 
</P>
<P>
Obergfell, who throws sidearm and has an effective slider and sinker, has 
allowed only three hits and struck out 15 in 10 innings of relief. Bretza has 
been suffering from the flu and will not pitch for at least three more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Scott Vollmer, who is hitting .412, is being recruited by Stanford and 
Pepperdine. Shortstop Terry Rahmatulla is starting his fourth season. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody else is new," said Flint. "Steve Nessl has been playing well at 
third base and doing some designated hitting. We've been very inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Heck, former Newport Harbor coach, has joined Flint's staff as a 
part-time hitting instructor. 
</P>
<P>
8. ESPERANZA 
</P>
<P>
What's the county's most successful program over the past three years doing so 
low in the poll? 
</P>
<P>
"We've had to do more extensive rebuilding than any other year since I've been 
here," said Mike Curran, Esperanza coach. "We shouldn't even be in a top 10. 
We're 5-1, but it's an ugly 5-1." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Weems, the team's best player, has yet to pitch. Weems strained a muscle 
in his right arm but Curran said the three-year veteran will throw this week. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Hauser, Dan Redington and Brian Pickler have picked up the slack. 
Redington, a 6-4, 215-pound junior, is the younger brother of former Esperanza 
star Tom, now in the Atlanta Braves organization. Redington doubles as the 
team's designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza's best position player is shortstop Jason Bates, a transfer from 
Whittier Christian. Bates is being recruited by Cal State Long Beach, 
Pepperdine and Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Curran is getting plenty of help from a frosh-soph team that was 20-1, winning 
20 straight games and scoring 10 or more runs in 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
9. FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
Coach Ron LaRuffa has moved from Edison to Fountain Valley after spending a 
year as an assistant at Rancho Santiago College. 
</P>
<P>
LaRuffa inherited eight returning starters, including three all-league 
selections from a team that finished 12-13 and fifth in the Sunset League. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Mark Dodd tied for the county lead with nine home runs and drove in 29 
runs as a junior. Pitcher Steve Montgomery had 70 strikeouts. Third baseman 
Jeff Higbee was the team's leading hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The outfield is set with returning seniors Rick Mock, Steve Grack and Rick 
Wolcott. Joining Montgomery on the staff is returning junior Jeff Hale. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's junior varsity was 13-2, and among the team's players expected to 
make an impact are first baseman Don Hallock and second baseman Garren Ito. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley (3-2) tunes up for its league opener against Ocean View on 
Friday with a nonleague game against Rolling Hills today. 
</P>
<P>
10. KENNEDY 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy nearly lost its playoff bid last year, dropping its final four league 
games and tying with Rancho Alamitos for third place in the Garden Grove 
League. The Irish needed a 3-1 victory over Rancho Alamitos in a playoff game 
to advance to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Irish are favored to win the eight-team league with all-league 
pitchers Greg Hansell and Pete Montera returning. Hansell was 7-2 with a 1.45 
ERA and 72 strikeouts. He has experienced a tender elbow and a stiff back but 
has won a game and saved a game this season. 
</P>
<P>
Montera, the starting quarterback on the football team, has won two games, 
including a shutout over Huntington Beach in which he threw only 70 pitches. 
Catcher Ernie Franco has driven in 12 runs in five games. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Steve Rath was a second-team all-league selection and anchors the 
infield. Rath and Hansell start their fourth seasons on the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
"Hansell and Rath have played about 75 varsity games and Montera and Franco 
have played about 55 games, so we've got good experience," said Chris Pascal, 
Kennedy coach. "The biggest surprise has been sophomore Scott Wood (hitting 
.556) whose playing catcher, outfield or DHing for us." 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch: Capistrano Valley, Edison, Foothill, Fullerton, Mission Viejo, 
Santa Ana, Servite, Sunny Hills, Troy, Tustin and Valencia.

KENNEDY SWEEPS PAST MAGNOLIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Lundby singled to left-center in the ninth inning of the second game to 
help Kennedy High School to a 4-2 victory over Magnolia and a sweep of a 
nonleague doubleheader Tuesday at Glover Stadium. Kennedy won the first game, 
6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Jody Clark of Magnolia had hit a two-run home run in the fifth to tie the 
score, 2-2. Magnolia had a chance to take the lead in the sixth, but Kennedy 
right fielder Don Cochran threw a Magnolia player out at the plate. Greg 
Hansell pitched the final six innings for Kennedy (5-2). 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, Peter Montera pitched a complete game for his third victory 
and hit a two-run home run. Teammate Steve Rath had two hits and scored twice,

ANGEL NOTEBOOK;

<P>
IT CONTINUES TO BE DANDY SPRING FOR BICHETTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TEMPE, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dante (Beef) Bichette slammed a 430-foot three-run homer last Thursday and he 
hit another three-run shot last Sunday, but the most encouraging thing that has 
happened to the 25-year-old outfielder this spring occurred Tuesday when the 
Angels posted the list of players who will report to Palm Springs Friday. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't so much who was on the list as who wasn't. Mike Ramsey, a 10-year 
veteran of the minor leagues, and Marcus Lawton, picked up in the Rule V draft 
this winter from the New York Mets, will stay behind and train at Mesa, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves starters Chili Davis, Devon White and Claudell Washington with Tony 
Armas and Bichette vying for the No. 4 outfield spot. Armas is hitting .150 
this spring. 
</P>
<P>
There's little doubt that Bichette has earned a chance in the big leagues. He's 
hitting .394 with a .697 slugging percentage and eight runs batted in this 
spring. And he had a pair of monstrous doubles off the left-center and 
right-center field walls in spacious Tempe Diablo Stadium -- it's 420 feet to 
dead center -- during the Seattle Mariners' 6-5 victory over the Angels 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It's just a matter of whether the Angels figure he would be better off playing 
every day in the minors or sitting on the bench and pinch-hitting in the 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't even gotten to that bridge, much less had to cross it," General 
Manager Mike Port said. "In a perfect-plan sense, we've got Davis, White and 
Washington, but who knows what might happen? 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, every player aspires to be on the club on opening day. But even if 
he's not, he might be there the next day and stay the rest of the year. In any 
case, we're obviously delighted in the improvement Dante's shown." 
</P>
<P>
Bichette said: "I really haven't thought too much about my chances of making 
the club," he said. "I'm just excited about doing so well." 
</P>
<P>
Bichette gives much of the credit to hitting instructor Deron Johnson, who, 
like Bichette, was a brawny power hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like Deron has really turned my career around," Bichette said. "He's 
taught me to just go up there hacking. Each week, he adds something new. Like 
now, we're working on staying back and using the whole field. He's been a great 
help to me." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson admits that he has a special rapport with Bichette, but he won't take 
any credit for his protege's power surge. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid's got a lot of ability and he's a really hard worker," Johnson said. 
"All I do is tell him all the ways I (messed) up when I was playing." 
</P>
<P>
Bichette got a bit of a break in the way of extra playing time because both 
Washington and Davis have missed some games, Washington with the flu and Davis 
with a hamstring problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Things always need to break in your favor, but he's earned his at-bats," 
Manager Doug Rader said. "I was really impressed when he hit that curveball for 
a homer (Sunday)." 
</P>
<P>
So, could the Angels have filled the void in their outfield without parting 
with $2.625 million to get free agent Washington? 
</P>
<P>
And another question is sure to be posed by the fans if any of the Angel 
outfielders struggle this season: 
</P>
<P>
Where's the Beef? 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Triple plays are rare enough, but the Angels turned one Tuesday after the 
Mariners loaded the bases on two errors and a hit batsman. Seattle's Steve 
Balboni hit a line drive at third baseman Jack Howell, who snagged the ball off 
his shoe tops, stepped on third to double up Alvin Davis and threw to Wally 
Joyner at first to triple up Jim Presley. Joyner wasn't sure if Howell caught 
the ball on the fly, so he stepped on the bag and also tagged Presley, who was 
sliding back into first. "It was a triple play either way," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Doug Rader may not be as intimidating as he was when he managed the 
Texas Rangers, but he hasn't lost the playful approach that characterized his 
career as a player. Former Angel Manager John McNamara, who was Rader's manager 
at San Diego in the mid-1970s, stopped by Gene Autry Park to visit Tuesday. 
McNamara and Rader were watching the B game against the Padres when Rader asked 
to try on McNamara's straw hat. All of sudden, Rader produced a bottle of 
flammable liquid and McNamara's hat was on the ground in flames. "I knew he was 
crazy when he played for me, but then he respected me because I was the 
manager," McNamara said. "I'll catch up with him in Palm Springs, and it'll 
cost him more than a new hat." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels announced the 34 players who will train in Palm Springs, starting 
Friday. Staying behind at Mesa will be pitchers Gary Buckels, Vinicio Cedeno, 
Colin Charland, Terry Clark, Mike Fetters, Jack Lazorko and Urbano Lugo; 
infielders Jeff Manto, Jim McCollom and Lee Stevens; outfielders Marcus Lawton 
and Mike Ramsey, and catchers Doug Davis and John Orton. Lazorko, who was 0-1 
with a 3.35 earned-run average with the Angels last season, has been pounded 
for 10 earned runs in five innings this spring. Clark, 6-6 with a 5.07 ERA last 
year, has a rotator cuff injury.

CHILEAN FRUITS PURGED FROM O.C. STORES IN CYANIDE SCARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Supermarkets throughout Orange County virtually eliminated Chilean fruit from 
their aisles and bins Tuesday and gave refunds to customers who had bought the 
produce before the recall. 
</P>
<P>
By midday, every major supermarket chain in Southern California, as well as two 
smaller independents, had recalled all of their Chilean produce in reaction to 
a federal warning that traces of cyanide had been found in a shipment of grapes 
grown in Chile. 
</P>
<P>
The voluntary recalls primarily involved Chilean grapes, nectarines, plums and 
pears, but at some stores also included everything from seedless watermelon to 
elephant garlic and quince. The kinds of fruit pulled from the shelves varied 
from chain to chain, depending on where the stores had bought produce. 
</P>
<P>
But every chain contacted -- including Vons, Ralphs, Boys, Lucky, Alpha Beta 
and Albertson's -- agreed that the crisis is one in which they are taking no 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to say something didn't pass inspection, (but) the word cyanide 
strikes in the heart," said Peter Sodini, president of the 51 Boys markets in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Sodini said he understood that the tainted shipments in Philadelphia contained 
only very minute amounts of the poison. Even so, "in this environment, if you 
err, you err on the side of being cautious," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're telling people, 'Sure, bring it back,' " Jim Sinclair, manager of the 
Pacific Ranch Market in Laguna Niguel, said about purchased produce. "We don't 
want to take a chance of anybody getting sick or losing a customer over that." 
</P>
<P>
The major chains would not guarantee that lost profits will not ultimately 
result in higher prices at checkout counters. "We don't know at this point," 
said Judy Decker, spokeswoman for the 351 Lucky stores. "A lot will depend on 
whether the (Food and Drug Administration) recommends that we destroy the 
fruit." 
</P>
<P>
Lucky -- along with Alpha Beta, Ralphs, Vons and Albertson's -- had removed 
cases of Chilean fruit by Tuesday afternoon and were holding unopened cartons 
in refrigerated storage areas or at the docks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holding Pending More Data 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to hold it until we receive further information from the FDA 
to release it or destroy it," said Al Marasca, executive vice president of 
marketing for Ralphs' 136 stores in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Other chains -- such as Boys Markets and Stater Bros. -- had already sent out 
truckloads of Chilean produce, returning unopened cases of fruit to 
distribution centers or the original vendors. "We're going to confront the 
supplier and suggest what he can do with it," Boys' Sodini said. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of both chains said opened cases, including produce already 
displayed in the stores for sale, were being destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Vons sought to reassure customers by announcing that the chain conducts its own 
random tests of produce, including items from Chile. The chain also subscribes 
to a state testing program, spokeswoman Vickie Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're more than reassured that the fruit is fine," Sanders said. "Nothing to 
date has shown up." 
</P>
<P>
The amount of fruit dumped by the chains will depend on the origin of the 
produce. Of the seven major chains in Southern California, Albertson's appeared 
to have the most to clear from its shelves. The Idaho-based chain removed 
grapes, peaches, blueberries, blackberries, seedless watermelon, cantaloupes, 
honeydew melons, raspberries, nectarines, quince, Granny Smith apples, cactus 
pears, pears and plums, said Chris Townsend, a spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Customers' Mixed Reactions 
</P>
<P>
While the chains were scurrying to remove cartons of Chilean produce, customers 
had mixed reactions to the recall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of scary to hear about," said Debbie Colquhoun, a shopper at the 
Vons store in El Toro. "You never know what you can eat anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Jo Hahn of Redondo Beach, who was shopping at the Laguna Hills Lucky store, 
said she bought grapes the other day, and "I don't know where they came from. 
We already ate most of them, so I'm not really sure now. . . . We'll just have 
to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the chains' problems was a second, unrelated scare involving apples 
and apple products. Reports in recent weeks have led to concern about the 
health risks of daminozide, a chemical used to treat apples. The substance is 
often marketed under the trade name Alar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asked to Provide Assurances 
</P>
<P>
Most of the major chains surveyed said they have asked vendors to provide 
assurances that apples had not been treated with the chemical. In fact, some 
chains -- notably Lucky, Stater Bros., Ralphs, Albertson's, Vons and Boys -- 
said they have had policies demanding that assurance for up to 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Since September, Ralphs has bought apples only "from growers who would sign 
written affidavits that all the apples they were selling to us were not grown 
with Alar," Marasca said. 
</P>
<P>
An independent test company also randomly samples Ralphs' apples for 
contaminants, which Ralphs has advertised widely, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that "our apple sales are very strong," Marasca said. 
</P>
<P>
But for Ralphs customers, apples are one thing and apple juice is quite 
another. The chain has seen some buyers shift from apple juice to cranberry 
juice, Marasca said. 
</P>
<P>
Some shoppers, such as Fred Kashani of El Toro, are taking a 
better-safe-than-sorry approach: "I'm not going to buy apples because my 
daughter is 2 1/2 years old. We're not going to buy until we hear more about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impact Remains to Be Seen 
</P>
<P>
The impact of the Chilean produce recall and the apple scare on consumer 
pocketbooks remains to be seen. Chains, by and large, said losses incurred from 
disposing of Chilean fruit would not cause them to raise prices on other items. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of fruit (being returned) isn't that significant," Sodini said. 
"The loss of produce won't involve a staggering number" of items. 
</P>
<P>
But an assistant manager at another chain who asked not to be named disagreed. 
"I think it will affect the consumer," she said.

FLUOR CHAIRMAN TO RETIRE WITHIN 6 TO 18 MONTHS; 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE FIRM'S PRESIDENT CALLED LIKELY SUCCESSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Having helped guide Fluor Corp.'s return to profitability, Chairman David S. 
Tappan Jr. said Tuesday that he plans to retire within the next 6 to 18 months 
and identified Fluor President Leslie G. McCraw as his likely successor. 
</P>
<P>
Tappan, 66, had intended to retire in 1987 but was persuaded by Fluor's board 
of directors to stay on and steer the big Irvine-based engineering and 
construction company through bad times that began in the mid-1980s. He oversaw 
a massive reorganization that is credited with turning the company around. 
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1988, Fluor recorded its first operating profit since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
During the company's annual shareholders meeting Tuesday, Tappan declined to 
answer a shareholder's question about his plans for retirement. He referred the 
question to board member Louis Wilson, who heads the board's organization and 
compensation committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Succession Plan 
</P>
<P>
Wilson told the group that the board will be working over the next few months 
on a succession plan but did not say when Tappan would step down. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Fluor officials said Tappan plans to retire in the next 6 to 
18 months. And Tappan issued a statement in which he said McCraw was his likely 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on Leslie McCraw's accomplishment and experience, he is clearly the 
leading candidate," Tappan said. 
</P>
<P>
Although analysts have speculated that Tappan would step down soon, Tuesday's 
statement marked the first time the company had discussed the timetable for his 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts generally praised Tappan's leadership and the diversification of 
Fluor, which early in the decade had invested heavily in coal and metals when 
prices for those commodities were at their peak and about to dive. 
</P>
<P>
Tappan, who joined the company 37 years ago, was named president in February, 
1982. He became chairman in late 1984, after the company's earnings had already 
started to slide. 
</P>
<P>
The company had earned $152.8 million in fiscal 1982, but by fiscal 1984 Fluor 
squeaked out earnings of only $1 million. Fluor subsequently posted losses of 
$633.3 million in 1985 and $60.4 million in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mining Operations Sold 
</P>
<P>
By 1987, Fluor sold several of its mining operations and was able to report 
earnings of $26.6 million, but its continuing operations still lost $75 
million. For fiscal 1988, the firm posted an operating profit and net income of 
$56 million. 
</P>
<P>
Tappan had planned to retire when he had reached a Fluor mandatory retirement 
age of 65. But Fluor's board of directors asked Tappan to see the company 
through the restructuring that shifted the emphasis away from energy services 
and into several other areas, including engineering and construction. 
</P>
<P>
"After holding the companies together through its agonies, he's certainly 
entitled to retire at 67," said Wayne Johnson, an analyst at H.G. Wellington, a 
New York brokerage firm. Tappan will be 67 in May. 
</P>
<P>
McCraw, 54, joined the company in 1977. He was president and chief executive of 
Fluor Daniel, the company's principal subsidiary, before becoming Fluor 
president in January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"He is highly involved in the company's performance right now," said Tom 
Samuelson, an analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps, a research firm in Chicago. "But 
Fluor will have new challenges as it continues to expand globally." 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, Fluor's board of directors voted to double the company's 
quarterly dividend to 4 cents per share. Analysts said the increased dividend 
might help boost the price of Fluor's stock. The stock, which closed Tuesday at 
$23.38 per share, is unchanged from the first of the year. Meanwhile, the 
S&amp;P index of 500 stocks has gained 6.3% so far this year.

FUROR OVER FRUIT FROM CHILE; 
</P>
<P>
A FEW BAD GRAPES MAY SPOIL OUTLOOK FOR STATE'S IMPORTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Stevedores in Los Angeles temporarily refused to unload a refrigerated 
freighter from Chile on Tuesday as dockworkers, fruit wholesalers, grocers and 
growers confronted the government's new warning against tainted fruit. 
</P>
<P>
The dockworkers relented later in the day after government inspectors declared 
the cargo safe for handling. 
</P>
<P>
The cargo was unloaded, but it remains detained at the Port of Los Angeles. 
Like tons of Chilean fruit detained in ports all over the world, this load of 
assorted fruits faces an uncertain future even as more fruit is on its way to 
U.S. ports. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a cold storage plant in City of Industry, a frustrated importer, 
Richard Eastes, criticized the government's broad action and, in a display for 
the press, ate a bunch of red seedless grapes from Chile. 
</P>
<P>
While Eastes' company, David Oppenheimer-California, and other importers 
cooperated with the government, Eastes clearly was unhappy at the broadness of 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's decision on Monday to hold up all 
imports of Chilean fruit. 
</P>
<P>
"When we had the Tylenol scare they didn't ban all aspirin," he said. "Here 
they found two berries and condemned the whole fruit industry of Chile." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Eastes and his fellow importers went along with the FDA decision, 
even though the agency has yet to issue a formal embargo on Chilean fruit. 
</P>
<P>
The American Produce Assn., which represents virtually all importers of Chilean 
produce, said its members are joining in the fruit recall and working with the 
FDA to set up a procedure for checking and certifying future shipments. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Chilean fruit-shipping season is in its fifth week, with the pace 
of shipments increasing. Less than half the anticipated shipments have been 
received, according to Chile's agricultural ministry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Damage Control' 
</P>
<P>
Eastes' firm, which brings in about a third of the 293 million pounds of winter 
fruit expected through the end of April, awaits the arrival of the freighter 
Canadian at the neighboring Port of Long Beach this evening. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian carries a cargo that is now doubly troubled: It contains the 
season's first load of green Granny Smith apples at a time a number of school 
districts, including Los Angeles City Unified, have banned all apples and apple 
products for fear that children might be harmed by residues of a little-used 
growth regulating chemical, daminozide, sold under the brand name Alar. (Eastes 
said the Chilean apples were not treated with the substance, which is more 
commonly applied to red apples and softer varieties of green apples to slow 
ripening and prolong crispness. Less than 5% of the current U.S. apple crop was 
treated with the chemical.) 
</P>
<P>
Another importer with fruit on the Canadian is Pandol Bros., a major importer 
and exporter based in Delano. "We're in damage control right now," said Darrel 
Fulmer, vice president for marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's devastating to the industry," Fulmer said, "and we're very concerned that 
terrorism may have found poisoned food as a forum to get their views out. It's 
just frightening -- two berries of grapes in one box, and look at the result!" 
</P>
<P>
David Michou, regional vice president of Stevedoring Services of America in 
Long Beach, which contracts to load and unload cargo, including that from the 
Reefer Creole, said it is too early yet to assess the impact of the FDA action 
on port employment. So far, he said, it has created "small disruptions." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the FDA actions were of great concern to California fruit growers, 
many of whom were gathered in Palm Springs for the California Table Grape &amp; 
Tree Fruit League annual meeting at the Palm Springs Marquis Hotel. The group 
represents about 90% of the state's peach, nectarine, plum and table grape 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
Most expressed concern that the action may negatively affect sales of 
California fruit crops, many of which will arrive in markets by May. 
</P>
<P>
"It scares me to death," said Martin Zaninovich, a table grape grower from 
Delano. "If it can happen to the Chileans, then it can happen to us. . . . Acts 
of terrorism in the food supply are a frightening situation." 
</P>
<P>
Zaninovich said that when any such recall is ordered, significant financial 
losses usually follow because produce is highly perishable and cannot withstand 
prolonged storage while the issue is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Biswell of Nash de Camp Co. in Visalia markets both Chilean and 
California table grapes. As such, he has been frequently sought out here for 
information on the tampering incident. Biswell has little to offer colleagues 
in the produce industry. 
</P>
<P>
"How the consumer takes this episode could be very detrimental for Chilean 
imports . . . and I don't look for this situation to help the California fruit 
growers much either," he said. "Can we recover? We've never experienced 
anything like this before." 
</P>
<P>
The Chilean grape harvest extends until the end of April. The harvest is almost 
exactly the opposite of that of California. Some growers and shippers here, in 
fact, credit the Chileans for sustaining consumer interest in fruit such as 
peaches, nectarines and grapes throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chileans do an excellent job," said Cliff Sadoian, a Dinuba-based grower. 
"They may even enhance our product by having the fruit available the 
year-round." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the Chileans' problem may also hurt this state's produce sector, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The public perception is of fruit in general," he said. "They don't know, or 
care, from where a particular commodity comes." 
</P>
<P>
Others believe that the FDA's ability to find two grapes apparently injected 
with cyanide out of 100,000 clusters of the fruit proves that there are 
safeguards built into the food supply. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get that message across, that the ability of the federal government 
to find two berries that were sabotaged means that the system works and it 
didn't fail us," said Micky George of George Bros. Inc. in Sultana, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, consumer fears generated from this issue may be 
transferred to California commodities in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't view this incident as helpful at all to the domestic situation," he 
said. "But that remains to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Chileans' problems may cut a different way, some acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"I think consumers would be more confident in California produce now," 
Zaninovich said. "In the United States, we have better regulations than in 
other parts of the world. Maybe the American public will feel better about our 
products." 
</P>
<P>
Though he worries about the fallout from the Chilean fruit recall, Sadoian also 
says it puts things into perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"Here in California we have the most stringent agricultural standards in the 
world. Other growers should try as hard as we do to conform to California's 
standards so that everyone's on the same playing field."

SAN DIEGO HOUSING COSTS STILL RISING, BUT THERE ARE SIGNS OF A COOLING-OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The average price of an existing house sold in the San Diego metropolitan area 
continued to increase at a brisk pace in February amid indications that last 
year's feverish escalation may be slowing because of the dampening effects of 
higher price tags and mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
According to the San Diego Board of Realtors, the average price of resold 
houses in the San Diego area was $187,636 in February, a 14% increase over the 
same month last year, but down 7% from the record $202,240 average price in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
A sign that the housing market may be cooling somewhat was that the median sale 
price, the point at which half of all houses sold for less and half for more, 
has remained flat since November. February's median price was $159,500, down 
from the $161,000 median price in January and only slightly above the $159,000 
median price reported by the board in November. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Board of Realtors, whose members broker home sales in San Diego, 
El Cajon, La Mesa and Chula Vista, has been keeping median price statistics 
only since August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers say market activity continues strong, however, mainly because demand is 
far outstripping the inventory of houses available for sale in the county. "We 
have one-third the inventory we would like to have in a normal marketplace," 
said Ann Throckmorton, a broker at Century 21-Regents Properties, a residential 
brokerage active in the University City area. 
</P>
<P>
An indication of the market's strength, Throckmorton said, is that only 1% of 
residential listings in the Mira Mesa area are expiring without having been 
sold, contrasted with typical expiration rates of 12% to 25% of listings. 
Listings usually last 90 days, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for houses remains high, brokers and lenders say, despite the 
half-percentage point increase in fixed mortgage rates over the past 90 days to 
11%. Fixed mortgage rates, as well as starting rates on variable mortgage 
rates, are up a full point from a year ago, said Rick McGill, residential 
lending manager at Great American First Savings Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not seen the higher rates translate into lower buyer activity," McGill 
said. "Our loan volume is about level and may be a bit stronger than a year 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
Blaming higher mortgage rates, Dennis Casey, group vice president at Home 
Federal Savings, said his S&amp;L's total year-to-date loan applications are 
about even or possibly a little below last year's volume. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego board members sold 910 houses and condominiums in February. That 
total is down from 1,095 units sold in January, but up significantly from the 
518 units sold in February, 1988. San Diego board members handle about half of 
all resales in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"The market may not be quite as hot as six months ago, before the 
growth-control initiatives were defeated, but it is still very active," said 
Chuck Hoffman, president of the San Diego board and head of ACI Investments, a 
Mission Valley brokerage. "Brokers are still getting multiple offers on houses 
as soon as they hit the market." 
</P>
<P>
In November, San Diego voters turned down a ballot initiative that would have 
placed strict limits on new housing construction within city limits. Fears 
among prospective home buyers that the measure would pass caused what some 
observers described as a buying frenzy last summer and fall. Those fears helped 
drive the price of an existing house up 18% in the San Diego area last year. 
</P>
<P>
Builders of new housing struck a more cautious view of the market Tuesday. Bill 
Fontana, a partner in Westana Builders Developers of San Diego, said there has 
been a slowing of buyer activity at new subdivisions because of higher prices 
and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana, whose company will open a 142-unit subdivision in Rancho Penasquitos 
next month with homes priced in the $240,000 to $275,000 range, said the 
skyrocketing cost of developable lots has pushed the price of new units beyond 
the reach of many buyers. 
</P>
<P>
That high cost of land is the main reason new houses in the county cost 
significantly more than existing houses, Fontana said. According to Market 
Profiles, the average price tag on all new units available for sale in the 
county at the end of 1988 was $211,800, or $30,000 more than the average sale 
price of existing units sold by San Diego board members that month. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll see a leveling off of price increases of new housing in the 
first quarter (to end March 30)," said Market Profiles President Russell 
Valone. His firm, a housing market research and consulting firm that tracks new 
subdivision sales, will report new housing prices for first quarter 1989 
sometime next month. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the quarter that I have really been waiting to see," Valone said. 
"Last year we had the growth-control initiatives hanging over the market, 
putting pressure on prices. Now that they have gone down to defeat, this 
quarter's data will really tell us something."

SEC Approves Stock Baskets: As expected, the Securities and Exchange Commission 
approved new financial instruments called "stock baskets," which would mirror 
price movements of large groups of stocks such as those in the Standard &amp; 
Poor's 500 index. The basket proposals were made by the American and 
Philadelphia stock exchanges and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. However, 
disputes about whether the instruments should be treated as stocks, futures or 
other investments are likely to delay their introduction for months.

Fewer Bank Failures: Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William 
Seidman said he expects the number of bank failures, which reached a record 221 
in 1988, to decline by about 20% this year. At the same time, while the outlook 
for banks' profits is good, their earnings are not likely to be as high as the 
record $25.2 billion earned in 1988, Seidman told a news conference. The 
nation's 14,000 banks earned a record $6.5 billion in the fourth quarter. A 
decline in loan-loss expenses helped boost earnings. Seidman said strength in 
the economy was an important factor contributing to the record year for banks. 
The record number of failures was largely because of the depressed economy in 
the Southwest, where lower oil prices and a recession in the real estate 
industry resulted in increased bank failures.L. William Seidman

Shuwa Purchasing Golf Course: Shuwa Investments Corp. is purchasing its first 
U.S. golf property: the 130-acre Seven Hills Golf Course in Hemet, Calif. The 
Japanese real estate company, which owns the Arco Towers in Los Angeles and a 
string of other premium U.S. commercial properties, is acquiring the public 
golf course from Korean businessman Dennis Lee, who has owned it for 18 months, 
according to Shuwa's lawyer Randolph H. Gustafson at Graham &amp; James. The 
purchase price was not disclosed, but sources said Shuwa paid less than $10 
million. The sale is to close in mid-April.

is valued at about $500 million. The jet cargo operator in 1985 ordered 20 
757PFs with options on 15. The new order represents the exercise of 10 of those 
options. Deliveries from the new order are to begin in August, 1991, and extend

Consumer Expectations Ease: Consumers' expectations fell slightly in February, 
and a record number of consumers said they expect interest rates to continue 
rising over the year, according to a survey by the University of Michigan. The 
university's index of consumer expectations, which measures consumer optimism, 
slipped to 88.8 last month from 89.9 in January. The base of 1966 equals 100. 
However, Richard Curtin, director of the university's consumer survey, told a 
press conference, "Overall, the current level of consumer expectations remained 
quite positive." The index is based mainly on questions about how consumers 
view their personal financial prospects as well as prospects for the economy 
over the short and long term.

CAR SALES SKID 18.5% IN EARLY MARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Sales of new domestic cars, apparently hurt by consumer worries about rising 
interest rates, plummeted 18.5% in early March, the auto industry reported 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic auto makers reported sales of 172,514 cars from March 1 to March 10, 
down from 211,772 in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a miserable sales number," said Theodore Sullivan, an automotive 
analyst with Wharton Econometrics. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan blamed the "impact of higher interest rates on consumer buying 
attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates have risen in recent months, partly because of efforts by the 
Federal Reserve to slow economic activity and thus curb inflation. The prime 
lending rate -- the bank lending rate used as a benchmark for many types of 
consumer loans -- is 11.5%, up from 8.5% a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts, however, said sales are slow because the car-buying cycle has 
finally matured after the country's four-year car-buying binge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly sluggish demand," said Christopher Cedergren, an auto analyst 
with J. D. Power &amp; Associates. "Demand for new cars has peaked. We've had 
four good years of new car buying. Demand has slowed to a more reasonable 
level." 
</P>
<P>
Maryann N. Keller, an automotive analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz &amp; 
Birney, sounded a similar note. "So many cars have been sold, its time for a 
rest," she said. "This is a buyer's market. Since the fourth quarter of 1986, 
the car market has been inching slowly toward a buyer's market. . . . We're 
really in it now." 
</P>
<P>
Among the Big Three auto makers, sales at Chrysler were off 35.9% to 22,236; at 
Ford, down 21.4% to 54,112, and at GM, off 13.4% to 82,575. 
</P>
<P>
Although they accounted for a tiny portion of the overall sales volume, sales 
of domestically produced Toyotas and Mazdas posted big percentage gains because 
of increased productivity at their U.S.-based manufacturing plants. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of the year to March 10, overall domestic auto sales are off 
9.7% to 1,235,121.

WARNER CHIEF MAY CASH OUT FOR $50 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The financial press is fond of saying "no money will change hands" when 
companies propose a merger by exchanging shares. 
</P>
<P>
But in the case of Time Inc. and Warner Communications, a check for the 
eye-popping sum of $50 million will be issued to Warner Chairman and Chief 
Executive Steven J. Ross if Warner's stock continues to trade at current levels 
and the merger is completed. 
</P>
<P>
According to documents made public Tuesday at the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, the 61-year-old Warner chairman must cash out on the portion of 
bonus plans that have fully vested at the time of the merger. If Warner records 
a 10-day average trading price of $50, Ross will receive $50.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Time executives, on the other hand, won't be cashing out because their company 
will be the surviving entity. 
</P>
<P>
Some differences in corporate culture between the two giants will be preserved: 
Time's top two executives continue to receive minimum guaranteed bonuses of 
125% of their base salaries, while Ross' bonus is pegged to the company's 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his $800,000 base salary, Ross will receive 0.4% of the merged 
company's pretax earnings, as opposed to his current formula of 1% of after-tax 
profits. Based on the 1988 results of the two companies, Ross would earn a 
bonus of $4.3 million, compared to $7.1 million under the old formula. 
</P>
<P>
With their annual base salaries and guaranteed bonuses, Time Chairman and Chief 
Executive J. Richard Munro will receive at least $1.46 million while Time 
President Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr. earns $1.29 million. 
</P>
<P>
Once the companies merge, Ross will also receive options on 1.8 million shares 
of Time Warner stock. 
</P>
<P>
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Warner shares closed 
Tuesday at $49.25, off 25 cents.

Boeing Upgrading Plant: Boeing Co., facing booming orders for its jumbo jets, 
said it will spend $300 million to upgrade its manufacturing facilities to 
compete better in the aerospace industry. The Seattle-based company is 
suffering from a huge backlog of orders because of burgeoning demand for its 
wide-body passenger jets. Boeing said it will upgrade its assembly plant, based 
in Renton, Wash., in the most extensive refurbishing since the site was 
constructed during World War II. The plans call for Boeing to build a third 
final-assembly structure, an extension to the assembly building for the 737, a 
facility to clean, seal and paint aircraft wings, a six-story parking garage 
and a 580-foot blast fence on north Renton Field to protect workers testing 
planes' engines.

Big Board volume came to 139.97 million shares, down from 140.40 million 
Monday. Analysts attributed the light volume to a lack of participation by 
institutional investors, who were awaiting a slew of economic reports later 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
The market opened higher on the heels of a bond market rally that followed the 
government's report of an unexpected 0.4% drop in retail sales last month. 
</P>
<P>
"The consensus was looking for flat to up 0.4% and that helped relieve concern 
that the economy is overheating," said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president for A. 
G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The report stimulated speculation that consumer spending has eased and that 
inflation is beginning to subside. 
</P>
<P>
But by mid-morning, the enthusiasm fizzled and the stock market drifted lower 
in the face of a weakening dollar, which suggested the possibility of higher 
inflation, further credit tightening by the Federal Reserve and higher interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
After rallying briefly around midday, the market drifted through the rest of 
the session on light trading volume as big institutional investors left the 
market to await the government trade report scheduled to be released in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, after some upward stimulation and feeling that maybe the economy is 
slowing the market has gone back into hibernation to await the trade figures," 
Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
Some economists have forecast a narrowing of the U.S. merchandise trade deficit 
in January to about $9.7 billion from $10.23 billion in December. 
</P>
<P>
Investors were also awaiting reports later in the week on housing sales, 
industrial production and wholesale prices to determine whether the Federal 
Reserve's tight credit policy is working, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Among blue chip issues, Philip Morris finished down 3/8 at 118 3/8, General 
Motors was down 5/8 at 84 3/4 and Union Carbide finished off 5/8 at 30 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Gainers included Coca Cola, up 1/4 at 50 1/4; Merck, up 5/8 at 66 1/4, and 
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up 1/4 at 31 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities closed down 2.068 at 2,917.116. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell 0.07 to 165.93. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index lost 0.26 to 340.95; its 500-stock 
composite index declined 0.18 at 295.14. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index was off 0.55 to 406.01; the American Stock Exchange 
index closed down 0.01 at 330.53. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks rebounded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Tuesday, bolstered by late 
buying by foreign institutional investors. Trading was moderate. The Nikkei 
225-share index, which fell 148.82 on Monday, recovered 171.39 to close at 
31,724.35. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks also rose sharply on the London Stock Exchange, strengthened by what 
market investors welcomed as an inflation-fighting budget plan from Chancellor 
of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. At the close, the Financial Times 100-share 
index was up 22.4 at 2,125.4.

Bond prices rose Tuesday in quiet trading on speculation that the economy may 
be slowing. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose about 1/2 point, or $5 for every 
$1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its 
price, declined to 9.11% from 9.16% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that retail sales dropped 0.4% in February, 
the biggest decline in almost a year. Sales fell to a seasonally adjusted 
$138.2 billion last month after rising a strong 0.7% in January. 
</P>
<P>
The drop-off was most apparent in sales of durable goods, normally the first to 
be affected by higher interest rates. Many banks raised the prime rate to 11.5% 
last month. The prime rate is a benchmark against which banks measure a variety 
of consumer and business loan charges. 
</P>
<P>
"It leads to expectations the economy is slowing in response to higher interest 
rates," said Steven A. Wood, an economist with BankAmerica Capital Markets 
Group in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 9.813%, up from 9.75% late Monday.

THE GRAPES' TWO-WEEK TRAIL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
According to Food and Drug Administration officials, the case of the tampered 
grapes from Chile -- two berries among 335,976 cases of red seedless grapes 
that reached the United States last weekend, began at the end of last month. 
</P>
<P>
A chronology: 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 27 -- The refrigerated freighter Almeria Star, loaded with Chilean grapes 
and other fruits, steams toward the Port of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
March 2 -- The U.S. Embassy in Santiago, Chile, receives a telephone message 
from an anonymous male caller warning in Spanish that export fruit would be 
poisoned. The FDA and the State Department confer, rule it a "probable hoax," 
but FDA and USDA inspectors are put on alert. 
</P>
<P>
March 8 -- The embassy receives a second call with the same message, similarly 
ruled a "probable hoax," but government inspectors intensify their monitoring 
as the Almeria Star sails up the Delaware River toward Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
March 10-13 -- A total of 335,976 cases of grapes arrive in the Port of 
Philadelphia. Inspectors examine 6,859 of these -- a far larger sample than 
normal -- and select six "suspicious" berries from the Almeria Star's cargo. 
</P>
<P>
March 12 -- Lab technicians in the FDA laboratory in Philadelphia detect traces 
of cyanide in two of the suspicious berries, which show puncture marks. 
</P>
<P>
March 13 -- After intense discussions, the FDA urges consumers to avoid 
consumption of all Chilean fruit and recommends destroying any grapes on hand. 
</P>
<P>
March 14 -- U.S. officials, exporters and importers ponder their next move 
while ordering shipments now heading for the United States to be placed in 
"detention" at U.S. ports. BRUCE KEPPEL

The dollar ended weaker against most key currencies in quiet trading Tuesday 
following the release of what foreign exchange dealers called disappointing 
U.S. retail sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices strengthened. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of 
$395.50 an ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EST, up $2.50 from Monday's late bid. 
</P>
<P>
Earl I. Johnson, a currency dealer at Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago, said 
the dollar was depressed by a Commerce Department report showing February 
retail sales had fallen 0.4%. 
</P>
<P>
"It was slightly disappointing," Johnson said. "The market had expected sales 
to go up 0.5%." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the decline lessened the possibility of higher interest rates, 
which often helps firm the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said domestic trading was quiet in advance of today's release of the 
January merchandise trade report. 
</P>
<P>
Overseas, traders said the British pound gained from the dollar's weakness. 
Sterling also was buoyed by the British national budget announced for the 
1989-90 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one pound cost $1.7170, more expensive for buyers than Monday's late 
$1.7125. Sterling fetched $1.7280 in New York, up from $1.71295. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose to 129.92 Japanese yen from 129.57 late 
Monday. The dollar traded at 129.85 yen in London, and at 129.79 yen in New 
York, down from 130.175.

This country's role as an international finance center is declining, the 
chairman of the Zurich stock exchange said. 
</P>
<P>
"Earlier statistical observations, made honestly but with a grain of salt, that 
Zurich is the world's fourth-largest financial center behind New York, Tokyo 
and London have dwindled into silence," Nicolas Baer said at a news conference 
announcing the exchange's annual report. 
</P>
<P>
Baer cited a trend toward greater economic and political stability as robbing 
Switzerland of its reputation as the world's haven for wealth. 
</P>
<P>
"When one considers the flow and volume of capital in the international 
financial world, one can only consider a financial investment in Switzerland as 
a secondary investment," Baer said, urging that Switzerland make stock 
ownership easier for foreigners.

LONDON SYMPHONY PERFORMS AT THE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Tilson Thomas led his London Symphony in an evening of astringent, 
cerebral music-making Monday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Tilson Thomas offered "Flourish with Fireworks," written by his friend Oliver 
Knussen as a homage to the conductor; Stravinsky's wartime, war-fraught 
Symphony in Three Movements, and Berlioz's "Symphonie Fantastique," which he 
had conducted at El Camino College on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Tilson Thomas displayed such virtues as precision, control, enforcement of 
textual transparency and rhythmic exactitude. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the 44-year-old Tilson Thomas, who has been principal conductor of the 
orchestra for only half a year, seemed far more calculating than spontaneous. 
He inclined toward intensifying and compacting energy rather than creating a 
sense of sweeping flow. 
</P>
<P>
He skillfully traced Knussen's Stravinsky-indebted fanfare, a 2-minute work 
that takes as much time to describe as to conduct. 
</P>
<P>
He began Stravinsky's Symphony with evocations of a ponderous war machine but 
failed to unify the abrupt transitions or build to a convincing triumph. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra, which produced lean, glassy string tone and some braying from 
the brass, was quick to respond to the conductor's direction. It proved alert 
and precise in difficult rhythmic passages and unified in making a mighty, if 
not a sumptuous, noise. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was the fierce, electric energy evoked in the last movement of 
Berlioz's Symphony -- which was reviewed previously -- that induced the 
audience to call Tilson Thomas back with enough enthusiasm to elicit Brahms' 
Hungarian Dance No. 1 as an encore. 
</P>
<P>
The concert was sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic Society.

CRAZY HORSE WINS THIRD TIP OF CAP

<TEXT>
<P>
Completing a hat trick of the 10-gallon variety, the Crazy Horse Steak House in 
Santa Ana has won its third consecutive Country Night Club of the Year award 
from the Academy of Country Music. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Reiser, co-owner and concert director of the nightclub, said Tuesday that 
the Crazy Horse's growing accumulation of silver, hat-shaped trophies -- known 
as Hat Awards -- is still far from being old hat. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really surprised," said Reiser, who is president of the Los 
Angeles-based ACM. "We thought maybe people would be voting against us because 
we'd won it the past 2 years. It's quite an honor for a little, 250-seat 
house." 
</P>
<P>
The nightclub award for 1988 was decided by the wing of the 2,800-member 
academy, which includes record company personnel, music journalists, publicists 
and the managers and booking agents who represent country performers. 
</P>
<P>
Hat awards for performers will be presented April 10 in a televised ceremony on 
NBC. MIKE BOEHM

BLUEGRASS AND WESTERN SWING: TWO BANDS DOING THEIR THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Along with the grit that got washed out of country music when it was watered 
down by "crossover appeal" in the '70s, country's longtime emphasis on 
instrumental prowess also seemed to get lost in the flood. Outside of Ricky 
Scaggs, the indomitable Merle Haggard and a handful of others, the notion that 
axes can speak louder than words has largely gone ignored in these past two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
It figures then that two of the best instrumental acts in country during that 
time, New Grass Revival and Asleep at the Wheel, have existed only at the 
fringes of the country-music community. But, if the two bands' clamorously 
received early show Monday at the Crazy Horse Steak House in Santa Ana was any 
indication, it's high time they came in from the cold. 
</P>
<P>
Since it was formed by frontman-singer-guitarist Ray Benson in the early '70s, 
Asleep at the Wheel has been rivaled only by Haggard in keeping alive the brand 
of music known as Western swing, a hybrid of country and jazz originated by Bob 
Wills and His Texas Playboys in the '30s. It's a music well worth saving, a 
true piece of America, with both hard times and an expansive view of the future 
shaping its musical moods. And, true to its title, it most certainly swings. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years Benson has gone through well over 60 band mates (an attrition 
due more, perhaps, to the band's 300-days-a-year touring schedule than Benson's 
reputedly volatile nature). While his present seven-piece lineup didn't burn 
quite as hot as it did in the days when steel guitar monster Lucky Oceans was 
in the band, it was still a remarkably tight outfit. And, on stage, the lanky 
Benson is nothing but pure entertainer, with an engaging-if-limited voice, some 
tremendous chops on the guitar and a flair for showmanship that had him 
juggling potatoes and catching them on his hat brim by show's end. 
</P>
<P>
The material ranged from the rock classics "Route 66" and "Hot Rod Lincoln" to 
Louis Jordan's R&amp;B novelty "Ain't Nobody Here but Us Chickens" to the 
boogie-woogie "The House of Blue Lights." Throughout, the hot ensemble playing 
and solo flashes recalled Wills' band, which was directly represented by "San 
Antonio Rose," "Roly Poly," and "Take Me Back to Tulsa." 
</P>
<P>
While the band has strong soloists on piano, sax and fiddle, the most 
consistently inventive playing came from steel player John Ely, particularly on 
a harmonic-studded solo on "Cotton Patch Rag." Benson's best moment came when 
he strapped on an acoustic guitar for a brief, but remarkably detailed, solo 
version of Robert Wilkins' country blues "Prodigal Son." 
</P>
<P>
Of the two bands, Asleep at the Wheel had the easier row to hoe. While the 
band's set relied almost entirely on Wills' proven style and a songbook of 
standards, New Grass Revival applied a challenging and unique reworking of 
bluegrass playing to original material and obscure covers. Even longtime fans 
couldn't count on familiarity, as much of the set came from the forthcoming 
"Friday Night in America" album. 
</P>
<P>
Quartet members banjoist Bela Fleck, guitarist Pat Flynn and mandolin-fiddle 
player Sam Bush are among the most respected of "musicians' musicians" on their 
respective instruments, while bassist John Cowan brings a strong high-tenor 
voice to their songs. Though their opening spot on the bill required them to 
compress their abilities into a far-too-short eight-song set, even one song 
would have conveyed how special the band is. 
</P>
<P>
Working from a thorough grounding in bluegrass, Fleck, Bush and Flynn propelled 
the picking in new directions, most notably on the encore instrumental "Metric 
Lips," incorporating Irish and Eastern European folk influences into its 
staggered rhythms and complex movements. Though more orthodox, "Can't Stop Now" 
was no less impressive, with breakneck, jazz and blues-inflected solos 
rampaging seamlessly from instrument to instrument.

PANORAMA CITY COMPUTER HACKER PLEADS GUILTY TO FELONY COUNTS

<TEXT>
<P>
A computer hacker from Panorama City, who was considered such a danger that 
prison guards supervised his phone calls to prevent him from accessing 
computers, pleaded guilty today to two felony counts that could imprison him 
for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitnick pleaded guilty to one count of possessing 16 unauthorized 
long-distance telephone codes and one count of computer fraud for gaining 
access to a Massachusetts computer company's system and stealing a security 
program. Mitnick, 25, will be imprisoned for 12 months and subjected to 
intensive supervision for three years after his release if the agreement is 
approved by U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer. She scheduled sentencing for 
April 24. 
</P>
<P>
When Mitnick was arrested, prosecutors insisted he posed such a threat to 
national computer security that he must be held without bail. Prison guards 
have been dialing the phone for him so he does not access computers.

BUSH SEEKS CHILD CARE AID FOR 2 1/2 MILLION POOR PARENTS; 
</P>
<P>
TAX CREDIT OF $1,000 PROPOSED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, in his first major legislative proposal, today asked Congress 
to approve a $1,000 child care tax credit for 2.5 million low-income families 
with children under age 4. 
</P>
<P>
The White House said the program would cost $2.5 billion a year by the time it 
is fully implemented in the 1993 fiscal year. Estimated costs during the 1990 
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 were put at $187 million. 
</P>
<P>
During the first year, a tax credit would be available to families with incomes 
of up to $13,000. Families earning up to $8,000 would be eligible for a credit 
equal to 14% of income up to a maximum of $1,000. The size of the credit would 
be reduced for families with incomes in the $8,000-to-$13,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
The credit would be refundable so that a family with little or no tax liability 
would receive assistance. For example, a family with an income of $5,000 that 
owed no federal taxes would receive a government check for 14% of its income or 
$700 under the plan. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1994 calendar year, families with annual incomes of up to $20,000 would 
be eligible for some tax credits. At that time, the White House estimated that 
3.5 million families would be covered by the program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'One of Key Issues' 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in a written statement, described child care as "one of the key issues 
facing the nation." 
</P>
<P>
He said his proposal, which represented fulfillment of a promise made during 
last year's presidential campaign, would increase the range of child care 
options available. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is considering a variety of child care proposals, including a plan 
endorsed by unsuccessful Democratic presidential candidate Michael S. Dukakis 
that would provide money directly to government-certified day-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush said that approach discriminates against parents who arrange for 
family members, friends or neighbors to care for their children. Church-based 
day care centers also might be ineligible for government funding under the 
Democratic plan because of constitutional limits on government assistance to 
religious organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents are best able to make decisions about their children and should have 
the discretion to do so," Bush said in his statement. "Assistance should go 
directly to parents. They, not the government, should choose the child care 
they consider best for their children." 
</P>
<P>
"The federal government should not become involved in licensing decisions, and 
federal financial support should not be made contingent upon state licensing 
decisions," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our plan will benefit all low-income working families with children, not just 
those who participate in government-sponsored child care," he added. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater conceded that there was no guarantee 
that the assistance, which would be refundable in order to be available to 
families without tax liabilities, would actually be used for child care. 
</P>
<P>
But he said it would be helpful to low-income families in any event. 
</P>
<P>
"Every little bit helps. Poor people need this money. They can use it to good 
effect." Fitzwater said. "There aren't many people under $8,000 who are not in 
serious need."

The military has identified the remains of a Huntington Beach Marine aviator 
who was lost over Laos in 1972, the day before his 29th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
A statement released Tuesday night by the Pentagon identified six American 
servicemen missing since the Vietnam War, including Maj. Sam G. Cordova, a 
former Ocean View elementary schoolteacher whose parents live in Rancho Mirage. 
The five other men whose remains were identified were shot down over Laos and 
North Vietnam in the mid- and late 1960s. Among them was one other Californian, 
a Naval Reserve lieutenant from Pomona.

SOVIETS EXPEL U.S. MILITARY AIDE AS SPY IN TIT FOR TAT WITH WASHINGTON

<P>
The Soviet Union shot back in an espionage war with Washington today, ordering 
a U.S. military attache expelled and saying the atmosphere of "spy mania" bodes 
ill for relations with the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said that Army Lt. Col. Daniel 
Francis Van Gundy III, an assistant military attache at the U.S. Embassy, is a 
spy and that he must leave the country in 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said Moscow was responding to Washington's expulsion last week of a 
Soviet military attache it accused of trying to buy computer secrets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First in 2 1/2 Years 
</P>
<P>
Van Gundy's ouster was the first Soviet expulsion of a U.S. diplomat in almost 
2 1/2 years, a period in which superpower relations have markedly improved. 
</P>
<P>
It clouded relations with the Bush Administration even before the President, 
who took office in January, announced the results of a review of American 
policy toward the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Administration is revealing its foreign policy, and we have this 
problem of spy mania," Gerasimov told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
He cited a recent Time magazine cover story on the 1987 Marine spy scandal at 
the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and said American leaders uninterested in improving 
relations had tried to incite fears of espionage. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not the ones who initiated this process," Gerasimov said, tacitly 
acknowledging the connection between last week's incident and the expulsion of 
Van Gundy. "It does not fit in with the trend for the positive development of 
Soviet-American relations." 
</P>
<P>
Van Gundy, 42, of Marina, Calif., had served in Moscow nearly two years, the 
normal diplomatic tour. 
</P>
<P>
He had been expecting the expulsion order since the State Department last 
Thursday ordered Soviet Lt. Col. Yuri N. Pakhtusov to leave the United States. 
Van Gundy held the same military rank and occupied the same diplomatic post in 
the Moscow Embassy as Pakhtusov did in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Van Gundy, who lived on the U.S. Embassy compound with his wife, Susan, and two 
of their three daughters, declined to answer reporters' questions. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov, speaking at the Foreign Ministry Press Center, charged that Van 
Gundy attempted "to enter a closed area, deliberately diverting from the 
officially permitted route, clandestinely photographed military sites and 
committed other gross violations" of the rules of diplomatic conduct. "Warnings 
had already been issued to the lieutenant colonel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman, Anita Stockman, said without 
elaborating that U.S. officials are "considering our response." 
</P>
<P>
Pakhtusov was accused of receiving sensitive information about how the U.S. 
government protects computer secrets. The State Department said he was caught 
in a six-month FBI probe after he approached an unidentified American employee 
of a firm that deals in classified information. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said the expulsion of Pakhtusov was "an artificially cooked scenario 
clumsily carried out by the FBI."

BURBANK FIREFIGHTERS ATTEMPT TO REMOVE SUBSTANCE FROM CREEK

<P>
Burbank firefighters were attempting to identify and remove a chemical 
substance discovered this morning in a Buena Vista Park drainage creek that 
empties into the Los Angeles River flood channel, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The spill in the 400 block of Bob Hope Drive was reported to police at 8 a.m. 
Firefighters and Los Angeles County health authorities were attempting to pump 
the chemical, believed to be a pesticide, out of the drainage creek before much 
of it emptied into the river channel. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were also attempting to identify the chemical and its origin. No 
one was hurt in the incident, and there were no evacuations in the area, near 
St. Joseph Medical Center and the NBC studios. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the drainage creek runs underground in the area. Authorities had no 
estimate of how much of the material was in the creek or had emptied into the 
river channel, but the milky white substance could be seen in the open creek 
for more than 1 1/2 blocks.

STICKY VALVE FIXED; SHUTTLE CREW TO COMPLETE MISSION

Discovery's astronauts overcame a sticky valve in the electrical system and 
began restoring full power to the space shuttle today, dispelling any need to 
cut short the five-day mission, NASA said. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle started drawing fuel again from the hydrogen tank that had been 
closed because of the valve, said Al Pennington, a flight director. 
</P>
<P>
"We're repowering back up at this time," he said. "It appears that the tank is 
back in operation, which means we're back on a nominal time line." 
</P>
<P>
The valve, which started jamming shortly after the launch Monday, had forced 
the crew to dim lights and shut down unneeded computers to conserve power. The 
astronauts were in no danger, but officials said the problem could have forced 
the shuttle to return to Earth on Friday, one day early. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a dim cabin and a careful use of electrical power, the astronauts kept 
to their schedule of conducting experiments and photographing environmentally 
damaged places on Earth during their second full morning in space. 
</P>
<P>
They focused a powerful 70-millimeter camera on the Tanzanian plains in Africa 
and then looked for evidence of pollution near Zanzibar, where a coral reef is 
dying. Other targets included the scars from a recent fire in the Everglades 
and an erupting volcano in Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
While over Australia, then in darkness, Discovery commander Michael L. Coats 
turned Discovery to get TV views of what he called "spectacular thunderstorms." 
</P>
<P>
Coats focused a television camera on crew mates Dr. James M. Bagian and Robert 
C. Springer as they made a minor repair on an experiment and vacuumed away 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob and I almost had a fight over the vacuum cleaner," Bagian joked. "We are 
the prime operators of that instrument, and we wanted a chance to show off our 
prowess."

A 16-year-old-boy has confessed that he shot a Huntington Beach man, took the 
body to the beach and set it on fire, police said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, whose name was withheld because he is a juvenile, was booked on 
suspicion of murder after he confessed Monday to killing 25-year-old Paul 
Edward Londono last January, Huntington Beach Police Capt. Bruce Young said. 
Young said the boy and Londono lived together in an apartment on Beach 
Boulevard in Huntington Beach where the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
The youth was arrested at Garfield Avenue and Beach Boulevard on a burglary 
warrant for a separate incident. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 8, at 11:15 p.m., a patrolman spotted Londono's burning body on a 
service road 20 feet below the Pacific Coast Highway and one mile west of 
Golden West Avenue, Young said. Londono's parents had reported him missing the 
day before, he said.

NEWPORT BEACH BARTENDER SLAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
A 47-year-old bartender at Delaney's Restaurant in Newport Beach was shot and 
killed early today by a gunman who accosted him as he walked to his car after 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The bartender lives in Newport Beach, but his name was withheld until relatives 
could be notified. Police Lt. Bob Oakley said the bartender was killed about 1 
a.m. as he walked to his car parked in the 3000 block of Lafayette Avenue near 
the Cannery restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Two men in a Toyota pickup truck drove the wrong way down Lafayette and stopped 
him, Oakley said. As the truck driver waited, the passenger got out, talked 
briefly with the bartender, then fired one shot into his chest. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no idea at all why the shooting occurred," he said. "We have a couple 
of witnesses but we are hoping more witnesses will call us because two 
restaurants in the area were still open and some people may have seen the 
incident and not realized what they were seeing."

Alex Trebek, the television game show host of "Jeopardy!" fame, will serve as 
host and moderator for the first National Geography Bee, the National 
Geographic Society announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six students, representing all 50 states as well as the District of 
Columbia and several territories, will compete in the nation's capital May 19 
for the top prize of a $25,000 college scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
The society, reacting to a recent study of international geographic knowledge 
in which American children ranked at the bottom, initiated the event -- similar 
to a spelling bee -- on a local level in January. 
</P>
<P>
Trebek said geography is a popular category on "Jeopardy!" because "we believe 
knowledge of today's world is essential. I'm extremely distressed that many 
young people in America know so little about this subject. I hope the geography 
bee will help change that."

30% RAISE FOR FEDERAL JUDGES URGED;

<P>
REHNQUIST WARNS OF 'SERIOUS THREAT TO FUTURE OF JUDICIARY'

Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist made an extraordinary appeal 
today for a 30% pay hike for federal judges in order to avert a "serious threat 
to the future of the judiciary." 
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist, holding his first news conference as chief justice to make the plea, 
said the Judicial Conference of the United States, which he heads, made a 
unanimous recommendation at its semiannual meeting Tuesday to seek the raise. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the single greatest problem facing the judicial branch today," 
Rehnquist said. "Failure to adequately address this issue would pose the most 
serious threat to the future of the judiciary and its continued operations that 
I have observed." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Judicial Conference "has decided to actively seek legislation to 
increase the pay of judicial officers. The resolution calls for a 30% increase 
in judicial salaries coupled with provisions that will assure that judicial 
officers receive periodic cost-of-living adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
A recent proposal to boost top federal salaries, including those of federal 
judges, by 50% went down to defeat in Congress after an acrimonious public 
debate showing that large segments of the public think members of Congress and 
others in the federal government already make enough money. 
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist, who makes $115,000 as chief justice, said judicial salaries, now 
$89,500 for a district judge, $95,000 for an appeals court judge and $110,000 
for a member of the Supreme Court, have not kept up with inflation and have led 
to a situation in which law clerks for federal judges make more money than the 
judge when they go into private practice. 
</P>
<P>
However, under questioning, Rehnquist could not point to a specific instance of 
quality suffering, and statistics show that last year only three federal judges 
retired or left the bench. 
</P>
<P>
He was also asked whether the public would agree that $90,000 a year is not 
enough money and whether judges should be in it for the money. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree completely that judges ought not be in it for the money and I know of 
no judge in the federal system that is in it for the money. They'd have to be 
out of their minds," he said.

The Senate Armed Services Committee today wound up hearings on Defense 
Secretary-designate Dick Cheney and scheduled an expected approval vote on his 
nomination for Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Dick Cheney is very well qualified to be secretary of defense and I 
plan to support him," Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said of Cheney, named 
by President Bush to replace John Tower after the Senate rejected Tower last 
week. Nunn and Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.) said they hope for full Senate 
approval of Cheney on Friday, before the Senate begins a two-week Easter 
recess. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, who led the Senate fight against Tower amid allegations of drinking and 
womanizing by the former Texas senator, said the committee -- which voted 11 to 
9 against Tower -- will vote on Cheney the first thing Thursday. "I don't know 
of any opposition to him," Nunn said.

QUICK ACTION ON FEDERAL BUDGET CALLED UNLIKELY

Quick agreement between congressional and Administration budget negotiators is 
unlikely and Congress may miss its April 15 deadline for drafting a spending 
plan, House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley said today. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not expect this to move very fast," Foley (D-Wash.) said as the 
closed-door talks resumed on Capitol Hill. "It has to move over a period of 
time. It's a gradual process." 
</P>
<P>
Foley said he did not expect agreement by March 23 when the negotiating group 
is scheduled to report to President Bush and the House and Senate leadership. 
"I think the 23rd is very early," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Historic Step' 
</P>
<P>
"What we would like to do is meet the April 15 date for a budget resolution," 
he said. But "that often has not been possible" and a May 15 completion of a 
fiscal 1990 budget might be more realistic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and congressional leaders agreed at a White House meeting Tuesday that the 
talks would aim to develop a consensus on broad generalities instead of 
specific programs in hopes of finding progress before the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is a historic step," said Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.), the 
senior Republican on the Budget Committee who gave the most bubbly assessment 
following the meeting. "I look forward to the beginning of earnest 
negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), 
was upbeat but less sanguine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'50-50 Chance' Seen 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got at least a 50-50 chance at this juncture of a successful 
negotiation," Sasser said. "I don't want to overstate the chances of success, 
however." 
</P>
<P>
White House aides have been meeting steadily with congressional budget writers 
since Bush on Feb. 9 released his $1.16-trillion spending plan for fiscal 1990. 
However, the discussions have dwelt on the scope and format of their mission as 
neither side has been willing to propose either new taxes or new spending cuts 
to reduce the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
At Bush's invitation, the budget negotiators, key committee chairmen and party 
leaders of the House and Senate met Tuesday at the White House to see if the 
talks could be moved forward.

Poland today introduced free currency trading for the first time since World 
War II as part of an effort to attack the black market and pave the way to 
convertibility of the Polish zloty. 
</P>
<P>
A long line gathered at Warsaw's central PKO savings bank, one of a handful in 
the capital that started buying and selling hard currency, as the new foreign 
exchange law came into force. 
</P>
<P>
The law, part of a package of reforms intended to haul Poland out of economic 
crisis, ended a prohibition on private trading in foreign currencies that had 
existed since the country went under communist rule four decades ago. It also 
lifted a 40-year ban on possession of hard currency, which carried a penalty in 
the 1940s and 1950s of heavy jail terms.

HOSPITAL CORP. OF AMERICA APPROVES $5-BILLION SALE

<P>
Hospital Corp. of America shareholders today overwhelmingly approved selling 
the nation's largest hospital management company to a management-led group for 
$5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
More than 41.7 million shares of common stock were voted in favor of the 
debt-financed acquisition. About 5 million shares were voted against the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Corporation Chairman Thomas Frist Jr. told a standing-room-only group of 
shareholders, "This has been a fantastic 20-plus years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exceeded many times over the founders' dreams for the company," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shareholders voted on the offer of $51 a share by TF Investments Inc., the 
management-led group headed by Frist. 
</P>
<P>
Corporation spokesman Victor L. Campbell said the transaction can be valued at 
$6 billion if both debt and equity in the new company are counted. If the cost 
of financing is not counted, the price tag is about $3.6 billion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A $1.3-billion short-term loan must be repaid within two years, and Campbell 
said some corporation assets will be sold to meet that obligation. The loan 
helped finance the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said a decision still has not been reached on which assets will be 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
The corporation is the leading hospital management company in the United 
States, with properties that include 79 medical-surgical hospitals and 48 
psychiatric hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company's proxy statement to shareholders indicated that subsidiary 
properties probably will be the first to go. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be fair to say the company has no agreement to sell any of its 
hospital facilities at this time," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
The management group submitted the only buyout proposal by a Nov. 18 deadline 
set by the corporation's board of directors. The board approved the buyout Nov. 
22.

The Federal Reserve district banks warned today that strong economic growth is 
creating inflationary pressures and that dry weather in the Central Plains may 
send food prices spiraling again later this year. 
</P>
<P>
In its March survey Current Economic Conditions, the Fed's 12 district banks 
reported that economic activity appeared to be expanding "at a moderately 
strong pace" through March 8. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumer spending, except for autos, has apparently gained momentum while 
manufacturing, especially for export, continues to show strength almost 
everywhere," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"In this environment," the report warned, "there is evidence of pressures on 
costs and prices." 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's concern about inflation has led it to raise interest rates gradually 
since last spring.

decision was announced by college President Stephen D. Nadauld a day after 
Price left to accept the head coaching position at Washington State University. 
Arslanian, 39, the sixth Wildcat head football coach since the school attained 
four-year status in 1962, follows in the footsteps of his father, Sark 
Arslanian, who coached the Wildcats for eight seasons from 1965 to '72. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Arslanian was the winningest coach in Weber State football history 
with an overall mark of 50-26-1.

Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer was released from the hospital today and has 
ordered a wheelchair with leg extenders to make getting around easier while he 
recuperates from knee injuries. Switzer reinjured his left knee and hurt his 
right knee in a skiing accident in Colorado last week. He had surgery on his 
right knee Saturday. His secretary, Kay Haslam, said the coach told her he 
would be at the office later in the day because he had a lot of work to do. 
</P>

Kathy Switzer, the coach's daughter, said her skis became tangled with his as 
the two got off a ski lift at Beaver Creek. "I kind of knocked him over," she 
said. "He fell backward and his knees went forward." Spring practice begins in 
a month and Switzer will direct the players from a golf cart.

Ozzie Newsome, the NFL's all-time reception leader among tight ends, said today 
that he will return for one more season with the Cleveland Browns. Newsome, who 
has been the subject of retirement speculation for several years, said he had 
decided to leave the game after last season but changed his mind after an 
overhaul of the Browns' coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Marty Schottenheimer quit the Browns at the end of the season over 
philosophical differences with owner Art Modell, and most of Schottenheimer's 
assistants also left. Newsome decided to wait until a new head coach, Bud 
Carson, was chosen, and the veteran tight end then had a long talk with Marc 
Trestman, Cleveland's quarterback coach last season, who has been elevated to 
offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
During his career, Newsome has had 610 receptions for 7,416 yards and 44 
touchdowns. He hasn't fumbled in his last 505 receptions and has caught at 
least 30 passes in each of his 11 seasons. Newsome, who celebrates his 33rd 
birthday Thursday, had 35 catches for 343 yards last season and extended his 
consecutive game reception streak to 143 games.

Canadian track stars still would be trying to cover up steroid use if the 
federal government hadn't ordered an inquiry into the Ben Johnson affair, 
sprinter Angella Issajenko testified today. 
</P>
<P>
But once Ottawa called an investigation of Johnson's failed drug test at the 
Seoul Olympics last fall "there was no point in trying to lie -- it was over," 
Issajenko said in her third day on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission hadn't been established in the wake of the Johnson scandal 
"we would have been denying it (use of banned steroids) until this day," she 
told the inquiry under questioning by her lawyer, Dennis O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
In tearful testimony the previous day, Issajenko said Johnson tried to let the 
people who made him the world's fastest human take the rap for Canada's 
greatest sports scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Issajenko said Johnson wrongly shifted suspicion to his coach and doctor with a 
statement last fall that he did not "knowingly" take banned steroids before 
being stripped of a gold medal at the Seoul Olympics.
