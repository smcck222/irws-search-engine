POLICE SATISFIED WITH MANTELL AFTER REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police officials announced Friday that they are "completely 
satisfied" that longtime police psychologist Michael R. Mantell is working the 
number of hours that he has been paid for interviewing police recruits and 
counseling law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
The police officials, including Chief Bob Burgreen, said they reached their 
conclusion after reviewing a list of contracts supplied by Mantell this week, 
and that they trusted that the number of hours Mantell said he works for about 
10 other government agencies did not conflict with his city obligations. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said they did no independent audit of Mantell's performance nor 
did they contact other government agencies to determine the scope of the 
psychologist's work and whether it conflicted with his requirements for the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen and Leroy Brady, head of the police personnel unit, said they were 
only concerned with Mantell's level of service for the city and were not 
particularly interested in how his work compares with other government 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"I've reviewed his figures," Burgreen said. "And I am completely satisfied he's 
performing for us the number of hours he's required. We have the utmost 
confidence in his ability to provide psychological services for this 
department." 
</P>
<P>
Police Department records show that Mantell worked 2,017 hours -- or about 40 
hours a week -- for the department last year, well above the 1,850 he was 
required to perform under his contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I work as much or more than that," the chief added. "So by no stretch of the 
imagination is the number of hours he's submitting to us unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
A separate investigation into Mantell's work by the San Diego County Civil 
Service Commission is expected to be completed next month. That probe began 
after a job applicant complained about Mantell's screening review process. 
</P>
<P>
Mantell met Friday afternoon with county investigators to discuss the status of 
their review. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking him a lot of questions," said Larry Cook, executive officer of 
the Civil Service Commission. "This is just a normal part of the 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Mantell could not be reached for comment Friday about the police officials' 
conclusion that he is performing the hours he claims on his work sheets, which 
he submits monthly to the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of those work sheets, obtained Friday by The Times, show that he 
normally works more than 2,200 hours a year for the Police Department, and that 
in his busiest year, 1985, he worked 2,472 hours, or about 47 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
Mantell has said that he works an additional 15 to 20 hours a week on his other 
government contracts and in his private practice. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 years, Mantell has enjoyed a no-bid contract with the city. But now that 
contract has been put up for bid, and Mantell is competing with 19 other 
psychological service providers who have submitted contract proposals. 
</P>
<P>
A special committee of advisers has been formed to study the 20 bids and make 
recommendations to the chief's office on which are best suited for the city 
contract. Mantell's current contract, at $235,000, is the largest program for 
police psychological services in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen said Friday that he would not allow the county's ongoing 
investigation, and dissatisfaction among some small city police agencies with 
Mantell's work, to influence his decision on whether Mantell will win the new 
contract for next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm certainly not ruling him out, and I'm not saying he's got a lock on it 
either," Burgreen said. 
</P>
<P>
City police officials began reviewing Mantell's work after learning of the 
county investigation. They said they wanted to make sure that because of 
Mantell's numerous obligations with other government agencies, the Police 
Department was not being shorted in the number of hours Mantell was supposed to 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
Brady said he and Burgreen met with Mantell this week, and that the 
psychologist submitted a list of about 10 contracts and performance obligations 
that he has with other government agencies. Included in that list was the 
average number of hours he spends each year on those obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Brady would not provide a copy of that list to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said that he and Burgreen concluded that Mantell's work with other 
agencies did not impede his ability to work the required number of hours under 
his city contract. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw nothing inappropriate," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
Jack McGrory, assistant city manager who oversees the Police Department, agreed 
Friday that Mantell's work for the city has been fault-free. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point we're comfortable he's doing a good job," McGrory said. "We 
think that he is giving our contract the high priority that it deserves."

IT'S THE CITY THAT WILL BE THE LOSER IF LOCKOUT CANCELS PADRES' GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City of San Diego will lose an estimated $40,000 for each baseball game at 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium that is canceled because of the ongoing labor 
dispute between professional baseball players and team owners, Assistant City 
Manager Jack McGrory said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It now appears very likely that the current baseball strike will affect the 
opening of the regular season," Assistant City Manager Jack McGrory said in a 
memo issued Friday to city officials. It was uncertain on Friday, however, if 
the labor dispute would be settled in time to avert the cancellation of Padres 
home games in early April. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' regular baseball season is scheduled to begin Monday, April 2, in 
Los Angeles. After four games against the Dodgers, the Padres return to San 
Diego for their 1990 home opener Friday, April 6, with the Cincinnati Reds. 
Following that three-game stand, the Dodgers are scheduled to travel to San 
Diego for a three-game stand beginning April 10. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the $40,000 in ticket and parking revenue that the city would 
lose for each game, McGrory estimated that various employees working at the 
stadium -- including concession workers, ushers and parking attendants -- would 
lose $60,000 in wages per game. There are also other indirect economic impacts 
to the city such as the lost expenditures from visiting teams and fans, 
according to McGory. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping it doesn't happen," stadium manager Bill Wilson said Friday. "But 
if (a cancellation occurs) we lose 10% of ticket sales, which amounts to 
$23,000 per game, average . . . and $28,000 for parking revenue." 
</P>
<P>
However, that $51,000 gross revenue loss would be trimmed because the city 
won't have to absorb expenses generated by baseball games. The stadium won't 
have to pay $4,500 for cleanup crews after each canceled games and the police 
department won't be paid $3,500 for patrolling the parking lot on game days. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the cancellation of some baseball games could stymie the stadium's 
ongoing attempt to retain part-time custodial employees at the stadium. "We've 
assembled a cast of people who are waiting to go to work," Wilson said. "We've 
worked all winter to hire them and I'm sure some of them are going to look 
elsewhere" if early season games are canceled. 
</P>
<P>
The city-run stadium isn't the only operation that would lose revenue if the 
labor dispute is not settled soon. 
</P>
<P>
"For each game that isn't played it means 50 or 60 people out of a job," said a 
spokesman for Ace Parking, which holds the stadium parking lot contract. "For 
Ace, it means a difference on profit and loss. We could lose a couple of 
thousand (of dollars) a month if they cancel a lot of games." 
</P>
<P>
"The Padres just are not generating any kind of interest in the community right 
now," said Jim Oakley, an executive at Air Ads Inc., a Brown Field-based firm 
that operates banner-towing aircraft that fly over the stadium on game days. "I 
know of one client of ours in San Francisco who has put a new promotion on hold 
until this thing is resolved, so it's definitely having an impact." 
</P>
<P>
When the Padres are drawing good crowds, Air Ads regularly includes the stadium 
in its advertising loops that extent West to the beaches. "When you've got 
40,000 to 50,000 captive readers, (the banners) are like required reading. 
Everybody looks up to see what they say." 
</P>
<P>
Bus lines also would lose revenue if home games are canceled. "We book four to 
six buses per week to Padres games," said Gus Zemba, president and co-owner of 
Kopecki Bus Lines in San Diego. "We haven't had cancellations yet, though, 
because it's too early." 
</P>
<P>
However, Kopecki already has cancelled two dozen charters to Yuma. "We 
typically do quite a few trips to (the Padres' spring training games) in Yuma, 
but that's all out the window now." 
</P>
<P>
KFMB-AM, the radio voice of the Padres, has filled programming holes caused by 
the cancellation of pre-season baseball games with "fantasy baseball games," 
according to KFMB Station Manager Paul Palmer. The Padres are 19-0 in the 
fictional games, Palmer said, but KFMB would "much rather be broadcasting 
baseball . . . we're innocent bystanders along with the fans." 
</P>
<P>
KFMB pays the Padres Baseball Club for the right to broadcast the games, so it 
will receive rebates for games not played. But KFMB generates baseball-related 
revenue by selling advertising that runs during pre- and post-game shows. 
</P>
<P>
In the event of cancellations, KFMB would continue to fill the ballgame time 
slots with sports-oriented programming, including more "fantasy" games. "We did 
that during the last strike and it worked pretty well," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
However, "what we'd miss would be the numbers in terms of ratings generated by 
the actual games," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of baseball games would mean little to San Diego Transit, which runs a 
dozen or so buses to home games. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Pads don't play, we'll actually save money because we usually take a 
loss on Padres service," a bus system spokesman said. "Only on the bigger 
events -- things like the home opener, the Sky Show, Cap Night -- do we break 
even."

AND BABY MAKES 3 FOR PROLIFIC ANIMAL PARK CONDOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A California condor laid her third egg of the breeding season Friday, the first 
captive "triple clutch" on record, the San Diego Wild Animal Park said. 
</P>
<P>
The condor, named AC 8, whose first egg of the season hatched baby Chuhlna 
earlier this week, laid egg No. 3 at 12:58 p.m., park spokesman Tom Hanscom 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said this is only the second time a condor is known to have laid three eggs 
in one season. The first recorded triple clutch, he said, also involved AC 8, 
in 1983 when she was still in the wild. He said keepers are optimistic that 
this egg will be fertile, as the other two have been. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 4-day-old Chuhlna, the first condor hatchling of the season, is 
eating voraciously, Hanscom said, and "seems to be out of the woods."

DAVIS SCHOOL FUNDS BILL IS BACKED; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: A PLAN TO PAY FOR NEW SCHOOLS BY RAISING THE SALES TAX FINDS 
EDUCATORS, BUILDERS AND ANTONOVICH IN ACCORD AT A SANTA CLARITA 'SUMMIT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a rare show of unanimity, Santa Clarita Valley school officials, developers 
and Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich on Friday threw their support 
behind a bill by state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita) that would increase the 
state sales tax to raise funds for building schools. 
</P>
<P>
The bill calls for an amendment to the state Constitution to increase the sales 
tax a quarter-cent per dollar for 10 years. It also would make it easier for 
local school districts to increase property taxes to build schools in rapidly 
growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Santa Clarita Valley's five school districts and the 
Building Industry Assn. of Southern California met with Davis and Antonovich at 
an education "summit" organized by Antonovich to develop a strategy to address 
school crowding statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Several bills aimed at raising money for school construction are pending in the 
Legislature, and Antonovich said he wants schools and builders to agree on 
which measures the county should endorse. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's meeting ended in harmony, quite unlike a similar meeting last week 
that broke up after 15 minutes when Antonovich learned that school officials 
and builders had not yet agreed on a joint recommendation to combat school 
crowding. The builders and school officials said they did not realize that 
their recommendations were due that day. 
</P>
<P>
An angry Antonovich said the builders and school officials had failed to show 
leadership on the issue. School officials promptly accused Antonovich of 
lacking leadership, saying he was ignoring county school crowding problems 
while trying to address the issue at the state level. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday's meeting was civil and businesslike. School officials and 
developers handed Antonovich their recommendations, and Davis outlined the 
provisions of his education bill. 
</P>
<P>
"The genius of this bill is that it goes for 10 years," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
The quarter-cent sales tax would provide a steady and reliable source of funds 
for new schools, Davis said. California's school construction program now 
relies on statewide bond measures, which must be approved by the voters. A bond 
measure that would raise $800 million is on the June state ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The sales tax would be more cost-effective than bonds because the state must 
pay interest on bonds, he said. It takes $2.1 billion, Davis said, to pay off 
$800 million in bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a stupid thing for anyone to do," Davis said. "It's an idiot's way." 
</P>
<P>
Under the Davis bill, school districts could raise property taxes up to 5 cents 
for each $100 of assessed valuation if the increase were approved by more than 
half the votes cast in a district election. School districts now need a 
two-thirds yes vote to raise property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Davis told Antonovich that an endorsement from the Board of Supervisors would 
help his cause in Sacramento, particularly among conservative lawmakers usually 
averse to tax increases. "The biggest problem we're going to face is Assembly 
Republicans," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to supporting Davis' bill, the builders and school officials asked 
Antonovich to support measures that would streamline construction guidelines 
and procedures that local school districts must follow to build schools. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich endorsed the basic elements of the Davis bill but said he has some 
reservations about extending the tax for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich said he will present the recommendations to the Board of Supervisors 
Tuesday. The board could vote on whether to support the package a week later. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's meeting concerned statewide solutions to school crowding but did not 
specifically address conditions in the Santa Clarita Valley, where the five 
districts predict they will need $400 million to build 33 new schools by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
Developers and Santa Clarita school officials have been at odds for more than a 
year over how much money the building industry should contribute to new 
schools. The districts are suing the Board of Supervisors to block construction 
of two housing developments in Castaic, arguing that supervisors have the power 
to deny building permits to projects that overburden schools and that they 
should use that power.

COUPLE INDICTED IN LAS VEGAS IN DISAPPEARANCE OF RETIRED GLENDALE BANK 
ACCOUNTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal grand jury in Las Vegas has indicted a couple in connection with the 
disappearance of a retired Glendale banking accountant. 
</P>
<P>
Being held without bail in a Clark County, Nev. jail are Stanley Alan Hershey, 
46, and Jan Vicki Fine, 37. 
</P>
<P>
They were indicted late Thursday on charges of conspiracy, illegal use of a 
bank card and transportation of a stolen vehicle across state lines in 
connection with the disappearance of Gordon T. Johnson, 62, a former employee 
of a subsidiary of Glendale Federal Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The man and woman were arrested March 1 in Las Vegas by FBI agents after they 
were found with a four-wheel drive Suzuki owned by Johnson, according to court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
They also are accused of withdrawing thousands of dollars from Johnson's bank 
account. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who retired last April as an accountant for Glenfed Development in 
Encino, has not been heard from since he telephoned relatives Oct. 14 to tell 
them he was leaving Bend, Ore., to visit a friend in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a bachelor, had sold his Glendale home of 27 years and had bought a 
$219,000 motor home and the Suzuki to travel about America in his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-foot motor home was found Jan. 29, parked at a trailer vacation resort 
just outside Phoenix in a space Hershey had rented, records show. 
</P>
<P>
However, theft of the motor home is not included in the federal indictment, 
which only applies to vehicles moved across state lines. 
</P>
<P>
Federal and local agents in several states are still investigating Johnson's 
disappearance.

AROUND THE VALLEY: SHORT AND TALL LEND A HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Leslie Berger 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in his life, Michael Gilden used a bowling ball that 
actually fit, with holes custom drilled for his small fingers and thumb, and 
the short distance between them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a nice, comfortable feeling," explained Gilden, a pony-tailed, 
part-time actor about 4 feet tall who marveled at the seemingly simple gift 
from the Brunswick Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Finding the right fit weighed on everyone's mind this night, from the dwarves 
who teetered beneath the weight of bowling balls to the giants who couldn't get 
a beer without brushing their heads on the bar's doorway. Average-sized patrons 
in the 1950s-style Burbank bowling alley, with its shadowy lighting, rhythmic 
crashing of pins and smell of wax, made an admirable pretense of concentrating 
on their games, despite the odd-looking party a few lanes away. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles chapter of the Little People of America was holding a 
fund-raiser, meaning that 10 lanes at Pickwick Bowl were reserved for several 
dozen dwarves. 
</P>
<P>
Five members of the California Tip Toppers Club -- whose female members must 
stand at least 6 feet, male members 6 feet, 4 inches -- attended in a show of 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Each group came with its own points of view, sets of problems and wry defenses 
against lifetimes of stares and thoughtless comments. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the eighth dwarf -- Horny," said the bumper sticker that actor Tommy 
Madden, 4 feet, 3 inches, brought as a joke for 4-foot-tall Louise Yankofsky. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't play basketball, my name isn't Shorty and the weather's fine up here," 
said the T-shirt of Warren Pratt, 6 feet, 8 inches tall, a second generation 
Tip Topper whose parents met in the club. 
</P>
<P>
"Be patient. God isn't finished with me yet," said the shirt worn by Elizabeth 
Barrington, a 4-foot, 4-inch stunt actor in children's movies. 
</P>
<P>
The Little People sat while waiting their turns to bowl, their legs dangling 
from their chairs. The legs of their dwarf children -- affectionately known as 
"Little Littles" -- stuck straight out like those of dolls. Tip Toppers reveled 
in their stature, standing between bowls, looking cool, leaning against the 
partition separating bowlers from spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Tip Toppers cheered strikes with high fives, very high fives; Little People 
celebrated with low fives. But flashes of snobbery -- some good-natured, some 
less so -- flickered among the general goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
"Them poor souls, they can never find a bed that fits," joshed Jerry Maren, 4 
feet, 3 1/2 inches, one of the Lollipop Kids in "The Wizard of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
"It really bothers me to see a tall man with a short woman," griped Mary, a 
5-foot, 11-inch homemaker whose marriage to 6-foot, 7-inch Paul entitles her to 
associate membership in the Tip Toppers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, 'Oh, what a waste of a nice tall man. One of my friends could be with 
him.' " 
</P>
<P>
Tip Toppers acknowledged that they joined the club in the hope of finding mates 
they could kiss without slipping a disc. They also described unexpected joy in 
being around people like themselves and finally feeling free from isolation and 
envy. 
</P>
<P>
At a Tip Topper party shortly before, teacher Linda Goldman and other female 
members talked of the pain of being unusually tall. 
</P>
<P>
An art teacher recalled that the length of her skirt never satisfied the nuns 
in her parochial school because she outgrew her clothes so quickly. A young 
department store manager, 6 feet, 4 inches, said she didn't date until college, 
and referred to herself as a freak. A middle-aged mother, 6 feet, 5 inches, 
told of being followed by little boys singing "the Jolly Green Giant" and 
pestered for dates by men with fetishes for tall women. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my initial reaction was that it just felt so wonderful being able to 
look everyone in the eye, or look up and feel dainty," said Robin, a 6-foot, 
1-inch waitress with broad shoulders and chestnut hair. As a teen-ager in 
Venice in the 1950s, Robin recalled, "I wanted to be a little blond 
cheerleader." 
</P>
<P>
Little People, too, remembered the first time they were around other dwarves. 
For Maren, now 70, it was on the set of "The Wizard of Oz." "I was with 125 
Little People, and I'd never seen one in my life," said Maren, who was 18 when 
the Munchkin recruiters found him. 
</P>
<P>
Patty Maloney discovered she was a dwarf at age 12 when her parents took her to 
a vaudeville show and a dwarf performer noticed her. "She came up to me and 
said, 'You're older than what you appear to be,' " recalled Maloney, who 
followed the woman backstage and found herself standing before images of what 
she would become. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'How wonderful!' " said Maloney, who wanted to go into show 
business and eventually became an actress. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Briscoe had a different reaction. "It fried me," said Briscoe, a former 
Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey clown. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Oh, my God, I look like them?' It was very hard at first. I guess I 
didn't want to take in the reality. But I grew up, and now I don't even think 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
The results of a raffle were announced. The winners of balls and bags and other 
bowling gear, gleaned from the entire bowling alley and not just the Little 
People party, left their games to pose for a picture. 
</P>
<P>
They lined up for the cameras: Pratt, 6 feet, 8 inches; Goldman, 6 feet, 1/4 
inch; Yankofsky, 4 feet; Maloney, 3 feet, 11 inches; Brunswick salesman Jerry 
Hale, 5 feet, 10 1/2 inches, and bystander bowler Phil Culotta, 5 feet, 11 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
They smiled and stood together, a fleeting reminder of the uneven world 
outside.

DEVELOPING VENTURA BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Planning Commission held a hearing on the Ventura 
Boulevard Specific Plan on Feb. 22. I was there, and I didn't like what I 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
After more than three years, the Citizens Advisory Committee for the plan made 
its recommendation, which proved to be compromise for all sides -- residents, 
businesses and developers. 
</P>
<P>
However, after the committee submitted its plan, and before the hearing, major 
changes were made that deserved further consideration by the committee. From 
what I could tell, not everyone at the meeting was happy to hear that the 
Planning Commission would like to see six-story buildings, fewer mom-and-pop 
businesses on Ventura Boulevard, and excessive trip fees for new development. 
</P>
<P>
I left the hearing feeling "What are they going to do now?" There is just no 
time for the committee to give the changes careful thought. It appears that the 
version of the plan found to be satisfactory by those most affected will now 
give way to political pressure and special interests. 
</P>
<P>
The plan must call for reasonable fees from the developers for new projects, 
local shopping services for residents, which will promote economic growth and 
jobs, and a two-story height restriction on the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
As a Sherman Oaks homeowner who wants business growth, yet at the same time 
knows the importance of preserving the residential neighborhood of our 
community, it angers me to think developers who live somewhere else can come to 
my neck of the woods to pressure city planners into a decision that will turn 
our residential streets into freeways and parking lots, shadowed by towering 
buildings offering few local services. 
</P>
<P>
We need a strong neighborhood-based plan approved quickly by the City Council, 
otherwise a healthly vision for the future of the Valley will become a pipe 
dream of the Citizens Committee.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An El Cajon man was ordered Friday to stand trial for the attempted murder of a 
prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
James Morris Jackson, 23, was also charged with assaulting the woman, holding 
her against her will, robbery and forcible oral copulation. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was arrested March 1 by the Metropolitan Homicide Task Force, which is 
investigating 42 unsolved killings of women -- mostly prostitutes -- whose 
bodies have been found in East and North county since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is charged with crimes involving only the Feb. 26 incident with the 
prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Bonnie Dumanis said she cannot comment on whether Jackson is 
a suspect in other cases. 
</P>
<P>
The prostitute, 30, identified Jackson in San Diego Municipal Court as the man 
who picked her up near 21st and Market streets downtown. 
</P>
<P>
She said he drove to an isolated area and asked her to get into the camper 
shell of his truck. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him I had to get paid first," the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
She said Jackson gave her $4, and she told him it wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
She said her assailant suddenly tried to choke her with both hands. 
</P>
<P>
After the attack, she said, Jackson apologized and told her he needed to see a 
doctor because he didn't know why he "treated girls this way." 
</P>
<P>
The woman said the man then dropped her off on 25th Street in San Diego, where 
she flagged down a car for help and wrote down the assailant's license number 
as he drove away. 
</P>
<P>
Following her testimony as the sole witness in the preliminary hearing, Judge 
Rafael Arreola bound Jackson over to Superior Court for trial. 
</P>
<P>
He ordered Jackson to appear March 30 for arraignment. Bail of $55,000 was not 
changed, and Jackson remains in County Jail.

CRACK BABIES: THE NUMBERS MOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crack babies suffer terribly -- starting even before they're born, when their 
expectant mothers smoke the highly addictive form of cocaine. That prenatal 
drug exposure can lead to premature birth, low birth weight and birth defects, 
according to a recent report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 100,000 crack babies are born every year. In the best of worlds, 
these children would be quickly identified and placed in foster care while 
their addicted mothers also got the help they need. In reality, many crack 
babies are not identified immediately. And social service agencies can't even 
meet the demand to help those who are. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, for example, a federal government survey found 8,974 newborn 
crack babies in eight cities, including Los Angeles. The estimated cost of 
hospital delivery, immediate postnatal care and foster care for those babies 
could be an astounding $500 million. And the costs will grow higher as the 
children grow older. Just to get one crack baby ready for school costs more 
than $40,000 a year, according to the report. For all 8,974 babies, that could 
add up to $1.5 billion before they are 5 years old! 
</P>
<P>
The oldest crack babies are already school-age and educators are warning that 
they may require years of special education to overcome their learning 
disabilities. The most emotionally disturbed may require residential care. If 
they get involved with drugs, as their mothers did, they will need treatment. 
That could cost billions more. 
</P>
<P>
But absent those billions of additional dollars, what can state and local 
governments do now to help these innocents? The HHS report advises aggressive 
campaigns that emphasize the dangers of prenatal drug exposure to expectant 
mothers. It also suggests more training for social workers who must handle the 
complicated cases of crack babies and their families, and who often must go 
into dangerous areas to track down mothers who abandon their babies. 
</P>
<P>
Local governments also can change policies to make foster placement and 
adoption easier. Few crack babies are adopted, according to the federal study. 
Despite needing better home environments, most are sent to live with their 
mothers or another relative. 
</P>
<P>
But local agencies can't do it all. The federal government must mount a 
national campaign to help Americans focus on the enormity of this problem, and 
then provide some of the funding needed to help crack babies lead as close to 
normal lives as they can hope for.

THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO STAY OUT OF JAIL; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: WHO, BESIDES THE PENAL SYSTEM, WOULD PROVIDE HEALTH CARE, ROOM AND 
BOARD TO UNEDUCATED BLACK MALES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDE BROWN, Claude Brown, author of Manchild in the Promise Land, lives in 
New Jersey. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of inner-city America probably think that a recent report disclosing 
that one out of four black males are under the control of the criminal justice 
system was at best unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody has to tell law-abiding citizens who live with steel bars or gates on 
their windows or three or four locks on their house or apartment doors that 
crime is rife in their community. If 25% of the young men are in jail, on their 
way to jail or have been in jail, these citizens are the victims of those 
crimes. And the 25% are their sons, husbands, brothers, fathers. 
</P>
<P>
Those who live or toil in our nation's inner cities know that the vast majority 
of black adolescents there are too under-educated and uneducated to obtain 
gainful employment outside the penal system. They cannot afford to live outside 
the penal system. In any major American city, a single adult living on his or 
her own needs a minimum annual salary of $21,000, realistically speaking, to 
maintain a decent standard of living. Very few prison inmates possess that kind 
of legitimate earning power. But in prison, inmates are given free health care, 
free dental care, free room and board and free entertainment and recreation. 
The average prison inmate cannot afford to stay out of prison. Furthermore, 
prison is the only thing for which most urban American public school systems 
prepare their students, and prisons usually replicate the failure of the public 
school system -- they prepare these inmates to return to prison. 
</P>
<P>
Inmates refer to their prison cells as "my house." As any experienced parent 
can verify, it is very difficult to dislodge even college-educated progeny from 
the nest, despite a bachelor's degree with which to face the world. 
</P>
<P>
To the black youths who will populate the criminal-justice system, dealing 
drugs is considerably more lucrative and therefore more appealing than 
employment at McDonald's or Burger King; very few sane people will choose to 
work for less than $5 per hour when they can earn $200 or more a day, even at 
the risk of going to prison, especially when there are no other legitimate 
alternatives. And jail is no serious threat. In this instance, it can be 
analogized to threatening to throw Br'er Rabbit into the briar patch. A more 
effective threat would be to eliminate the illegal drug market and threaten not 
to send to jail. We must devise ways to throw them out of prison and to keep 
them out and out of criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Mauer, author of the report by the Washington-based Sentencing Project, 
states that we now risk the possibility of writing off an entire generation of 
black men. The unabridged truth is that the deplorable situation on which the 
report focuses arose because the powers that be have been writing off an entire 
generation of African American men in inner-city public schools for the past 
four decades. 
</P>
<P>
The ramifications of this gross social injustice have been manifold and 
profound in their impact on the national black community: Dealing crack has 
become the No. 1 alternative to futile employment in low-paying jobs in 
fast-food restaurants; man-sharing is becoming increasingly popular among young 
African American women; white men are becoming more appealing to successful 
black women, and the establishment of an inner-city tradition of criminal 
pursuits as acceptable and even preferable vocations. 
</P>
<P>
I am compelled to disagree with Mauer when he says that "we really don't know 
what it will mean for the future," referring to his report, "because we have 
never had a situation like this before." 
</P>
<P>
One does not have to be psychic to know that this current social condition will 
produce a dearth of fathers and husbands for this generation and the next 
generation of African Americans. There will also be increased hostility and 
suspicion of national policy-makers by black leaders, accompanied by increasing 
acceptance by some of the black genocide conspiracy theory. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, while teaching a creative-writing course in one of New York 
state's correctional facilities, I met an extremely gifted inmate for whom I 
was certain I could obtain a book contract with a major publishing house. When 
I expressed my desire to write a letter to the inmate's parole board, informing 
it of Jeff's literary potential, he was obviously amused. I assured him that I 
was serious about the letter. He apologized for chuckling at my offer and said, 
"My parole board ain't been born yet." When I asked him to elaborate, he 
responded, "Man, I'm doing triple life." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff was 24 but appeared to be no more than 16. What a pity that some truly 
dedicated teacher did not discover and cultivate Jeff's talent before he killed 
three people in cold blood. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's puts more black teen-agers to work than any other employer in 
America, including the federal government. But according to Lee Dunham, 
president of the Black McDonald's Operators Assn., 80% of the inner-city 
teen-agers employed by the chain are unable to cope with elementary arithmetic. 
"If I didn't have computerized cash registers, these kids would give the store 
away in a couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Life is much easier in prison. Even the most rudimentary knowledge of 
arithmetic is unnecessary; one merely has to know how to maintain a "bad dude" 
image. Thus prison is a less challenging and intimidating environment for the 
African American youths of urban America, whom the public schools have failed. 
It is imperative that the country's urban school systems be rendered affective, 
from kindergarten up, or abolished as too burdensome, economically and in human 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Prisons are the ideal place to begin this educational process. They have 
captive student bodies, ample time and few distractions. But we must be ready 
to pay maximum salaries for gifted teachers. Every inmate should be compelled 
to learn a salable skill or trade and earn at least a general-education 
diploma. 
</P>
<P>
They will comply if the proper motivation is provided. Major corporations 
should be given tax incentives to adopt cell blocks or other prison units whose 
inmates are from families that have never had a high school graduate; that have 
been on welfare for two generations or more; that have a history of teen-age 
parenting for three generations or more, and resolve to have those negative 
histories end with this inmate's generation and with this inmate. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps within the next 10 years, such a program could be expanded to include 
entire prison and non-prison populations. State and federal governments could 
gradually assume sponsorship of such programs. 
</P>
<P>
A Burger King franchise owner in Detroit has instituted a program of paying 
college tuition for his young workers. He also pays to train them for better 
jobs elsewhere, such as computer programming. He will pay tuition for training 
costs of up to $10,000. With this program, he saves $41,000 a year in trainee 
costs. His employee turnover rate drops from 41 persons a year to nine, and the 
$10,000 is tax deductible. This is a great program for the nation. It should be 
advocated for all businesses. 
</P>
<P>
We must act now. If America's prison population doubles in the next decade as 
it has in the preceding decade, where will we put the inmates, and how will we 
finance their incarceration? It is more responsible and less expensive to train 
and educate that disgraceful 25%. Frankly, we can no longer afford to send them 
to jail.

MALATHION SPRAYING FOR THE PESKY MEDFLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All attempts to put an end to Medfly spraying have so far been unsuccessful, 
and Southern California residents continue to be bombarded with pesticide 
despite their protestations. 
</P>
<P>
It's time to renew an old idea; that of dividing California into two separate 
states. It has always made sense, given the disparate economies and cultures of 
the north and the south. The agriculture-controlled government of a Northern 
California would have had no authority to spray poison on the heads of its 
unwilling Southern California neighbors.

MALATHION SPRAYING FOR THE PESKY MEDFLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The alleged safety of malathion fails to reflect a substantial body of data to 
the contrary. It is true that malathion is among the least toxic insecticides 
when measured by traditional gross toxicological measures. 
</P>
<P>
However, malathion is a potent skin sensitizer and can cause allergic reactions 
after a single exposure. Malathion has also been shown to induce persisting 
neuro-behavioral, learning, and electroencephalographic disturbances in young 
animals exposed to small fractions of acutely toxic dose levels. Additionally, 
several studies have raised unresolved questions of the genetic hazards of 
malathion. 
</P>
<P>
More ominously, a detailed review published in a prestigious peer reviewed 
scientific journal, has documented the carcinogenicity of malathion and its 
persistent breakdown product malaoxon in multiple strains of experimental 
animals, thus creating the strong presumption of human cancer risk. It would 
thus appear reasonable to object to such risks, particularly in view of 
evidence on the contrived nature of the Medfly crisis and on the highly 
questionable need for the current draconian eradication program.

NIXON'S VISIT TO CAPITOL HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, ad nauseam, Nixon is being "rehabilitated" by his nostalgic 
admirers and a bemused press. Conrad, as usual, is right on target in 
satirizing this latest resurrection of our disgraced ex-President. 
</P>
<P>
What puzzles me, as a retired Foreign Service officer, is Nixon's reputation as 
a foreign policy guru, which rests largely on the puffery that surrounded his 
not-so-surprising restoration of relations with China. Otherwise, he has been 
associated with some notable fiascoes. 
</P>
<P>
As President Eisenhower's reputed expert on Southeast Asia, our then-vice 
president pushed for us to replace the French when they were forced out of 
Vietnam by the 1954 debacle of Dien Bien Phu, while he ignored any possible 
understanding with Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
Later, his decision to bomb Cambodia appears to have been part of a sequence of 
disasters that led to the genocidal scourge of Pol Pot. Was the slaughter of 
millions of Cambodians part of his "peace with honor"? 
</P>
<P>
On Iran, did Nixon foresee that our overthrow of Premier Mohammed Mossadegh in 
1953 might eventually lead to the fanatical revolution of 1979? What led him, 
as President, to believe that the vain, mercurial shah could be our effective 
surrogate in maintaining peace in that troubled area? 
</P>
<P>
Has Nixon ever regretted our 1954 ouster of the leftist Arbenz government of 
Guatemala, which led to a series of brutal military dictatorships and to the 
loss of more than 100,000 lives? 
</P>
<P>
The same deviousness and amorality that entangled Nixon in Watergate 
characterized his foreign policy maneuvers. By using his national security 
adviser, Henry Kissinger, as de facto secretary of state, he was able to avoid 
Congress' traditional scrutiny of cabinet members. This finally led him to use 
the NSC for action purposes, as in the CIA's apparently successful overthrow of 
Chilean President Salvador Allende in 1973, which almost certainly became the 
precedent for the supreme folly of Irangate. 
</P>
<P>
This institutional perversion persists, with President Bush frequently relying 
on his NSC staff to perform missions that should logically fall to our resident 
ambassadors or to the secretary of state and his deputies.

GUARDIAN ANGELS IN FLAP OVER SCUFFLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven Guardian Angels were detained by police and cited for alleged misdemeanor 
battery and false imprisonment after a late-night scuffle with two men on a 
downtown San Diego street, police reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred Thursday night after the Angels confronted two men they 
accused of smoking crack cocaine and urinating in public. 
</P>
<P>
The two men, Melvin Jackson and Thomas Criner, told police they wanted to place 
the Angels under citizen's arrest. Witnesses in a nearby bar also told police 
that Jackson and Criner had done nothing to provoke the fight, police spokesman 
Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, self-styled crime fighters, were taken into custody for several 
hours, cited and ordered to appear in court in May. 
</P>
<P>
Weston Conwell, the Angels' regional coordinator, was outraged by the episode. 
He said the Angels were trying to place the men under citizen's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past we've had an excellent relationship with the police," Conwell 
said. "But this smacks of harassment." 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation began about 11:30 p.m. at 9th and F streets when the Angels 
saw one of the men "lighting something" and the other man allegedly urinating 
on the side of a building, said Eden A. Dankowski, a 20-year-old in training to 
be a Guardian Angel. He was among those cited. 
</P>
<P>
Dankowski said one of the men "took a swing" at the Angels. Two Angels "took 
him down and handcuffed him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
They uncuffed the man before police arrived, according to Dankowski. But 
Jackson and Criner told police they wanted to file a complaint. Jackson and 
Criner were not arrested, and no one was hurt in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dankowski, the Angels were not given an opportunity to tell the 
police they had wanted to place the men under citizen's arrest until hours 
later. "We were trying do the right thing, " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Conwell said the incident indicates the need for an official liaison between 
the police and the Guardian Angels. "We act as a deterrent to crime," he said. 
"And we have the support of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Said Robinson: "There are those citizens who stand by the Angels and appreciate 
their companionship. And there are those who do not. 
</P>
<P>
"Their function, as we see it, is to serve as our eyes and ears, not to be 
enforcers or vigilantes. This action smacks of vigilantism," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman David Cohen said that Cmdr. Larry Gore, head of the Police 
Department's public affairs unit, and Cmdr. Jerry Sanders, who heads the police 
district where the incident occurred, will meet with Conwell Monday to discuss 
the relationship between the Angels and the police. 
</P>
<P>
"If he (Conwell) has a problem," Cohen said, "let's see if we can solve it."

PAYING FOR STATE HIGHWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two recent front-page articles, Douglas Shuit's "Tax Revolt: 1990: Hello 
Gridlock" (March 6) and William Trombley's "Age, Growth Take Heavy Toll on 
State," Feb. 11), discuss state government's struggle to maintain services and 
infrastructure in light of voter imposed limits on spending and taxation. 
</P>
<P>
While, both articles are generously sprinkled with quotes from frustrated 
elected officials and bureaucrats, little attention is given to the other side 
of the equation: How much can taxpayers afford? 
</P>
<P>
Government may need more money to keep up, but so do the people of California. 
</P>
<P>
For a generation and more, government in California has increased faster than 
the citizen's average personal income. Taxpayers pay for the roads and then 
must purchase and operate a car on those roads. Automobile costs are increasing 
33% faster than increases in California average worker incomes. We pay for 
services to our homes and for services for those who don't have homes, but the 
cost of a mortgage or rent or home repair is going through the roof. Only 16% 
of the people in Los Angeles have the required income to afford a median priced 
home. 
</P>
<P>
With taxpayers pushed to their financial limits just to keep up with costs of 
everyday living, other answers besides tax increases must be explored to solve 
government's problems. Privatization of government services to get more in 
return for each tax dollar is one promising alternative given little or no 
attention by the tax-and-spend lobby.

PAYING FOR STATE HIGHWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, there's a tax revolt. The reason is plain -- we are stressed out. Federal 
taxes are climbing for the former middle class, which is now the lower middle 
class. 
</P>
<P>
All our hopes for climbing the ladder are fading fast in the wake of the 
Reagan-Bush tax gifts to the rich, combined with the failure of the famous 
Reagan trickle-down theory. 
</P>
<P>
I would vote for the 9-cent gas tax if it would provide public transportation 
and road maintenance, but I don't want to see any more freeways built. New 
roads will service the new people, who are clearly not paying enough taxes to 
build roads to service their needs, and will not answer the problem anyway -- a 
new road quickly exceeds its capacity, and the only solution then is to build 
more roads. 
</P>
<P>
We need more health care, schools, police and jails, and more housing because 
our population increases, directly or indirectly, lead to more illness, 
children and crime, and a terrific housing shortage. All this is true because 
demand far exceeds supply. The only possibility, then, is to cut the demand. 
</P>
<P>
The common theme here is our skyrocketing population. We are not managing the 
astonishing growth of this state, which is why Californians are crying loudly 
for better urban planning. 
</P>
<P>
We must do something about it before we all become New Yorkers.

MALATHION SPRAYING FOR THE PESKY MEDFLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems abundantly clear that a large number of citizens do not approve of the 
aerial spraying of malathion upon our communities. 
</P>
<P>
Yet our state government seems, at best, sluggish and aloof in its response to 
citizen concerns regarding this issue. My question is this: From where does the 
power of government stem? Based upon the experience of this ongoing malathion 
saga, the power of government obviously does not reside with us ordinary 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The implications brought forth in this struggle go far beyond the pros and cons 
of malathion -- what might be suggested is an implementation of basic 
democratic reforms in this country.

MALATHION SPRAYING FOR THE PESKY MEDFLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The debate on the use of indiscriminate spraying of malathion in order to 
control the Medfly has been limited to arguments concerning economic 
considerations and the health of the human population. One of the most 
important considerations has been neglected. 
</P>
<P>
Malathion is not specific against the Medfly. It will kill any and all insects 
which come in contact with it. This includes the beneficial insects such as 
bees and ladybird beetles. In addition, birds, amphibians, reptiles and small 
mammals will be vulnerable to its effects. 
</P>
<P>
My apricot tree, which is now in bloom as it has been many years at this time, 
will probably bear no fruit this year. It has, as yet, been visited by not a 
single bee. Is Southern California destined to be the first region of the earth 
to usher in the "Silent Spring"?

WOMAN KILLED AS VAN SWERVES OFF FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale woman was killed Friday morning when her van mysteriously swerved 
off the Glendale Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol has been unable to determine what caused the 
crash, said Officer Tami Low of the CHP's Verdugo Hills substation. 
</P>
<P>
Low said Lili Amirian, 34, was driving south between 8:20 a.m. and 8:45 a.m. 
Witnesses said the vehicle was in one of the middle two lanes and suddenly 
swerved to the outside, Low said. 
</P>
<P>
The van turned end-over-end and came to rest in a culvert on the side of the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Amirian was pronounced dead at the scene. Her son Edwin, 2, survived with only 
a bump on the head, probably because he was strapped into an infant car 
restrainer in the back seat, Low said. 
</P>
<P>
The van showed no sign of mechanical defect, and all four of its tires were 
intact, Low said.

TORRANCE COUNCIL REJECTS PROPOSED OFFICE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voicing concerns about traffic and density, the Torrance City Council has 
rejected a proposal to build a seven-story office building and four-story 
parking structure near the corner of Hawthorne and Torrance boulevards, one of 
the city's busiest intersections. 
</P>
<P>
After the council's 6-1 vote against the proposal this week, Duke Runnels, 
senior vice president of Oxford Properties Inc., said his firm would design a 
smaller project. 
</P>
<P>
The project was to be the second phase of development on a 16-acre parcel at 
the northwestern edge of the Del Amo Fashion Center, near the Marriott Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project -- the 107-foot-high Computax building and 
parking structure -- was approved by the council in 1987 on a 6-1 vote, with 
Councilman Bill Applegate opposing it as too bulky. 
</P>
<P>
Applegate reiterated his opposition this week, and this time was joined by all 
his colleagues, except Councilman Dan Walker, who voted for the second phase of 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the type of structure I want to see on that site," Applegate said. 
"I voted against the Computax building because it was a high-rise building with 
little setback, and I am opposed to a similar project." 
</P>
<P>
Walker said he favored the project because it was consistent with the first 
phase. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed second phase consisted of a 101-foot-tall office building situated 
52 feet south of Torrance Boulevard; a four-level parking structure behind the 
office building and a one-story office building near Torrance Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
A key issue in the debate was the density of the project. 
</P>
<P>
When the Computax building was approved, the council insisted that there be no 
more than 80 square feet of floor space for every 100 square feet of property 
area, or a floor area ratio of 0.80, for the entire 16-acre project. 
</P>
<P>
But the council permitted a higher density -- a floor area ratio of 0.94 -- on 
the 7.3-acre parcel where the Computax building was to be situated, with the 
understanding that a lower density would be observed on the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
On the second phase, however, Oxford asked for an even higher density. The 
proposed building would have had a floor area ratio of 0.95 on a 3.3-acre 
parcel. The company said that a lower density on a third parcel -- a floor area 
ratio of 0.50 on a 5.3-acre site -- would keep the floor area ratio for the 
entire property within the 0.80 limit. 
</P>
<P>
But the council wasn't buying this approach. 
</P>
<P>
Applegate was the most vocal in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"This project is out of place," Applegate said. "It is not consistent with the 
previous proposal made on the property." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the proposed building was only 6 feet lower than the Computax 
building but would be only 52 feet from the curb, compared with the minimum 
66-foot setback for the Computax building. 
</P>
<P>
Applegate said he wanted to see a smaller building without a new parking 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be real honest," Councilwoman Dee Hardison said. "I wish I asked the 
piercing questions three years ago." She added that the proposed project was 
"not what I visualized."

NORTHERN IOWA STUNS MISSOURI

<P>
It was the biggest upset so far in the men's NCAA Division I basketball 
tournament -- a 14th-seeded team from an obscure conference beating a 
third-seeded team from among the nation's elite. A team with no NCAA tournament 
experience beating a team that ranked No. 1 in the nation before a late-season 
slump. 
</P>
<P>
"This team has been remarkably good in close games," Northern Iowa's Coach 
Eldon Miller said after the Panthers' 74-71 victory over Big Eight power 
Missouri in Friday's opening round of the Southeast Regional at Richmond, Va. 
"I've never coached a team that's handled close games so well." 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Newby made a three-point basket with one second left as the Panthers, 
winners of the Assn. of Mid-Continent Universities tournament, won their first 
NCAA tournament game. Their next opponent will be Minnesota, which beat Texas 
El Paso, 64-61, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted them to shoot the ball with a hand in their face," Missouri Coach 
Norm Stewart said. "Under ordinary circumstances, we don't think that ball will 
go in." 
</P>
<P>
Troy Mullenburg and Brad Hill provided the outside shooting and Jason Reese 
added inside scoring and rebounding as the Panthers built a 12-point lead with 
4:49 to play. 
</P>
<P>
But the No. 11 Tigers used an 8-0 run to cut the deficit, and Nathan Buntin 
tied the score, 71-71, when he made a layup with 29 seconds left, was fouled by 
Reese and sank the free throw. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth personal for Reese, who finished with 18 points and 15 
rebounds, 11 on the defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
Northern Iowa (23-8) brought the ball up and called time out with 10 seconds 
left. Newby, who finished with nine points, worked himself free on the left 
wing and took the winning shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I was only going to take the shot if I was open," said Newby, a 6-2 junior 
guard who led Northern Iowa by making 52.9% of his three-point shots this 
season. "I was open and I didn't rush it." 
</P>
<P>
Missouri was unable to get the ball in play before time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the biggest game we've played in four years, but then, a school like 
us doesn't play any little ones," said Miller, in his fourth season at Northern 
Iowa. He had taken Western Michigan and Ohio State to the NCAA tournament 
earlier in his coaching career. "Words can't describe what this means to me, to 
the players, to the school and the community." 
</P>
<P>
The win gave the Panthers a 2-1 record against major teams this season. They 
lost to Georgetown, 83-49, in December and beat Iowa, 77-74, in January. 
</P>
<P>
Mullenburg finished with 16 points and Hill 11 for Northern Iowa. Buntin led 
Missouri with 21 points, including 14 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri (26-6), which lost to Colorado in the first round of the Big Eight 
Conference tournament last weekend, lost four of its final five games. 
</P>
<P>
"We were flat today," Stewart said, "but it doesn't take anything away from 
their effort. We didn't get up in their face in the first half." 
</P>
<P>
Mullenburg scored seven points and Hill six in an 18-4 run that gave Northern 
Iowa an early 25-11 lead. The Panthers made all six of their shots in the run, 
including five from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Northern Iowa made eight of 12 three-point shots en route to a 42-31 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri shot 38% in the first half, and the taller Tigers were frequently 
limited to one shot by an aggressive man-to-man defense that collapsed quickly 
to rebound.

<P>
For the first time in 13 years, Gene Bartow's pained expression returned to the 
sideline at a UCLA game Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Alabama Birmingham coach, once in charge of the Bruins and first in a line 
of successors to John Wooden, watched as UCLA defeated his Blazers, 68-56, in 
the first round of the NCAA East Regional tournament. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA overcame an 11-0 deficit start, a sluggish offensive effort and the 
ineffectiveness of Don MacLean to win before 10,742 at the Omni and move into 
the second round against fifth-ranked Kansas, which is seeded second and is 
unbeaten outside the Big Eight. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a pretty game," UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said, "but as a coach you 
don't really worry about things like that." 
</P>
<P>
Especially at this point, when the only concern is winning and avoiding 
elimination from the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (21-10) will play Kansas (30-4) Sunday at the Omni. 
</P>
<P>
UAB will make the two-hour bus ride back to Birmingham, where it will 
contemplate a dismal shooting performance. 
</P>
<P>
"We just went cold," Bartow said of the Blazers, whose 34.9% shooting was their 
worst of the season. Only Cal State Fullerton, which made only 31.4% of its 
attempts Dec. 23 in an 87-75 loss at Pauley Pavilion, has shot worse against 
the Bruins this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably the big reason we didn't shoot the ball well was because UCLA's 
defense was very good," said Bartow, who credited MacLean for keying the effort 
that stymied the Blazers. "The inside defensive play by MacLean was much better 
than I thought it would be." 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-10 sophomore with a soft shooting touch, MacLean has never been 
considered much of a defender. When Lou Campanelli of California benched 
MacLean last summer at the Olympic Sports Festival, he said it was because he 
found MacLean's defensive effort wanting. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to Bartow, MacLean enabled the Bruins to pressure UAB's 
perimeter players by forcing 7-2 center Alan Ogg away from the basket. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't weigh all that much for how tall he is," MacLean said of the 
230-pound Ogg, who scored eight points. "And when I bumped him out, it seemed 
like his teammates didn't want to give him the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Given no other choice, the Blazers (22-9) attempted to beat the Bruins from the 
outside, but made only five of 23 three-point shots while being harassed by 
Trevor Wilson, Gerald Madkins, Darrick Martin and Mitchell Butler. 
</P>
<P>
Their leading scorer, swing man Andy Kennedy, scored only nine points, making 
just two of nine shots. Guards Jack Kramer and Barry Bearden combined for 18 
points but made just seven of 26 shots. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA wasn't able to take control until the end because it had its own offensive 
problems. At one point, Harrick shouted: "What's going on?" 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins failed to score in their first nine possessions, missing six shots 
and making three turnovers in falling behind, 11-0. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, our shot selection wasn't perfect," Harrick said. "We got in too 
much of a hurry. I want us to do it with patience and poise. You can't beat a 
good team shooting shots that you're not going to be able to make." 
</P>
<P>
Unless, of course, that team is shooting even worse. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when we were down 11-0, I knew there was no way those guys were going to 
beat us," MacLean said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins put together an 8-0 run, caught the Blazers at 22-22 with 4:42 left 
in the half, took the lead at 28-27 on a free throw by Gerald Madkins with 1:07 
left in the half and never trailed again. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't buy a basket for 10 minutes," Bartow said. 
</P>
<P>
UAB was within 58-54 with less than two minutes left before being outscored, 
10-0. Martin fed Wilson for a dunk to spark the blitz, then made four 
consecutive free throws. MacLean added two more free throws and Butler capped 
the run with a dunk. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson led the Bruins with 23 points and nine rebounds. MacLean struggled, 
making three of 14 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Said MacLean, who seemed surprised to hear that Bartow had praised his 
defensive effort on Ogg: "It was something I started to think about when I 
couldn't throw a pea into the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Murray scored 14 points and took seven rebounds for the Bruins, and 
Martin had eight points and eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
UCLA shot 42.6%. . . . UCLA's Trevor Wilson called the officiating "the best 
I've seen in a while, especially coming from the Pac-10." . . . UCLA is 7-0 
against Kansas, but the teams have not played since 1978, when the Bruins won, 
83-76, in an NCAA first-round game at Eugene, Ore. . . . Since 1980, when it 
lost in the championship game to Louisville, UCLA is 3-3 in the NCAA tournament 
and has not advanced beyond the second round . . . UCLA Coach Jim Harrick is 
3-5 in NCAA tournament games, 2-1 in two seasons with the Bruins. . . . Reserve 
guard Kevin Williams of UCLA stayed home for the funeral of a cousin. . . . 
UCLA's Zan Mason turned his right ankle in practice Thursday night and was 
unavailable to play, Harrick said. . . .Tracy Murray turned an ankle and left 
the game with 1:55 left . . . Only Arizona State, beaten by the Bruins, 62-53, 
on Jan. 11, has scored fewer points against UCLA this season . . . UCLA failed 
to make a three-point shot for only the second time this season, missing all 
five attempts. . . . Reserve forward Elbert Rogers led UAB with 11 points.

TO THESE FANS, NCAA MEANS NO CLUE AT ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am appalled by the audacity of the NCAA in its refusal to grant Cal State 
Long Beach basketball a berth in the postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
On one hand, these deities harass numerous coaches and their programs for 
archaic infractions, yet on the other hand, the NCAA cozies up to CBS and 
blames their subsequent malfeasance on the late timing of the final Big West 
match. 
</P>
<P>
The officials of the NCAA should be subject to the same scrutiny and virulent 
judgment that they parcel out -- and heading the inquisition should be Jerry 
Tarkanian, Neil McCarthy and Joe Harrington. I'm sure those three gentlemen 
would not be at a loss to locate transgressions of the accused.

'CHEAP PUBLICITY' STUNT SADDENS A FELLOW LAWYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am an attorney, an LMU alumnus, and was at the game when Hank Gathers died. 
The LMU community had a special relationship with and respect for Hank. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that if someone contributed to Hank's death, that person 
should be held responsible. 
</P>
<P>
This last week has been difficult, but the Gathers family and LMU have handled 
it with dignity. In contrast, I am struck by how inappropriate and distasteful 
are the actions of the family's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
To hold a news conference and make accusations before Hank is buried, before 
the medical examiner's office releases its finding, before a majority of the 
facts can possibly have been examined, and while the team and members of the 
university are in Philadelphia is disgusting. There is no reason that any legal 
action could not have waited several weeks or even a month or two. The only 
possible reason for this timing is for the cheap publicity it offered the 
attorney, which you provided by putting his picture on the front page of the 
sports section. 
</P>
<P>
It is no wonder my profession is held in such low regard. It made me sick to my 
stomach.

MICHIGAN HOLDS OFF ILLINOIS ST., 76-70 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michigan Coach Steve Fisher grimaced as soon as Wolverine forward Sean Higgins 
released a three-point shot from the top of the key with 2 1/2 minutes left 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The shot missed badly and Illinois State, which trailed 70-66, scored four 
consecutive points to tie, 70-70, in an NCAA West Regional first-round game at 
Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
But Higgins, who never met a shot he didn't like, kept shooting. And his 
persistence paid off. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins made a three-point shot from the left side with 1:13 remaining to give 
the Wolverines a 73-70 lead and the defending NCAA champions held on for a 
76-70 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to strangle Higgins when he took that first shot," Fisher said. "But 
I could have kissed him after he made the second one." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Higgins wasn't the Wolverines' first option on the play, which was 
designed to go to guard Rumeal Robinson, who had a game-high 24 points. But 
Robinson drove toward the basket, drawing Higgins' defender to him, and kicked 
the ball out to Higgins, who had worked his way open on the wing with 1:13 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Before sinking the game winner, Higgins missed three of his first four 
three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't lose confidence in your shot," Higgins said. "You've got to keep 
shooting and that's what I did." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the first time Higgins has made a game-winning shot in the NCAA 
tournament. He had 14 points, including the game winner, as the Wolverines 
defeated Illinois in a 1989 NCAA semifinal game. 
</P>
<P>
It was also a familiar story for Robinson, who made two free throws with three 
seconds left in overtime to give the Wolverines an 80-79 overtime victory over 
Seton Hall in the 1989 NCAA final. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Robinson made two free throws with 43 seconds remaining to seal the 
victory over Illinois State (18-13), which missed its last seven shots, 
including a dunk. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson admitted he was thinking about the free throws he sank in last year's 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"It flashed through my mind for a minute when I walked up to the line," 
Robinson said. "I said I was going to hit them." 
</P>
<P>
Michigan (23-7) faces Loyola Marymount or New Mexico State Sunday in a 
semifinal game. 
</P>
<P>
And no less an expert than Indiana Coach Bob Knight picks Michigan to become 
the first team to repeat as NCAA champion since UCLA in 1972-73. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope he's right," said Fisher, who's 7-0 in the NCAA tournament. "He's 
pretty smart."

HORRY MAKES SURE ALABAMA IS ON TARGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Horry peered at the third-best defense in the nation Friday, then shot 
it full of holes. 
</P>
<P>
Horry's 27 points on 10-for-14 shooting led Alabama past Colorado State, 71-54, 
in the first round of the NCAA West Regional at the Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
When Colorado State, giving up 58.9 points a game, tried to play Alabama man to 
man, Horry slipped free for long jump shots. When the Rams went to a zone, 
Horry, a 6-foot-9 sophomore forward, shot over the defenders. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Crimson Tide shut out the Rams during a 6-minute 24-second span 
in the first half as it improved to 25-8. Alabama will play Arizona at about 5 
p.m. in Sunday's second-round game. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State finished at 21-9. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams led, 20-18, after Mike Mitchell made one of two free throws with 8:06 
left in the half. Then Colorado State, which had controlled the game's pace and 
had led by as many as seven points early, went cold. Mitchell finally ended the 
drought with a short jump shot, but Alabama had scored 13 consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime, the Tide led, 33-22, as Horry, a 44.5% shooter, made six of seven 
shots, including five three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you have a drought like we had, you're certainly not going to stay in 
the game," Colorado State Coach Boyd Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
And the Rams didn't, trailing by as many as 19 points late in the game on the 
way to their worst defeat of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I looked up at the scoreboard, we were always pretty far behind," 
Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State made one run at Alabama, closing to 52-42 with 7:59 left. 
</P>
<P>
But David Benoit sank a jumper from the lane, Horry picked up a loose ball at 
mid-court and dunked and, after Colorado State called a timeout, Alabama's 
Melvin Cheatum and James Sanders scored from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama's lead was a comfortable 60-42 with 4:22 to play. 
</P>
<P>
"From about the 10-minute marker until the end of the game we were a pretty 
good defensive basketball team," Alabama Coach Wimp Sanderson said. 
</P>
<P>
And with Horry, who made six of eight three-pointers, and Sanders, who had 18 
points on seven-of-10 shooting, leading the way, Alabama shot 62.2% from the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama, which made 15 of 21 second-half shots, fought Colorado State's defense 
with patience. Horry said he was content to pick his spots. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't going to force the threes," said Horry, who was two points short of 
his career high. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sanderson: "The only thing I try to tell him is to sort out his shots. I 
thought he shot a couple today that were questionable, but they went in so I 
said, 'Good shot.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, a forward from Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, led Colorado State 
with 24 points, 17 in the second half. Mark Meredith added 15 points.

MINNESOTA BEATS UTEP IN OVERTIME

<P>
Minnesota showed Friday how to win when you make only a third of your shots. 
</P>
<P>
All you have to do is take more of them. 
</P>
<P>
With Melvin Newbern and Richard Coffey leading a defense that forced 23 
turnovers, and Newbern and Kevin Lynch taking care of the shooting, the 
20th-ranked Gophers beat Texas El Paso, 64-61, in overtime in the first round 
of the NCAA Southeast Regional at Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
They will face Northern Iowa, which upset Missouri, 74-71, in the second round 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a real pretty game from a spectator standpoint," Minnesota Coach 
Clem Haskins said in one of the day's understatements. "Northern Iowa is a 
really outstanding team and we've got to be able to play a much better game 
than we played today." 
</P>
<P>
The Gophers (21-8) made only 22 of 66 shots, but they took 19 more shots than 
the Miners (21-11). More important, they forced turnovers at key moments, such 
as on three of the Miners' first five possessions in overtime, allowing them to 
jump off to a quick five-point lead. Newbern and Coffey caused two turnovers 
during an 8-1 run that erased a 47-42 Texas El Paso lead -- the biggest for 
either team in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
His three-point basket with 55 seconds left broke a 50-50 tie and, after Henry 
Hall's three-point shot 34 seconds later sent the game into overtime, Newbern 
gave the Gophers a quick lead with a running one-hander. He also scored the 
final points of the game on a layup after the Miners closed within one point. 
Newbern finished with 15. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't the only ones struggling out there," said Norm Ellenberger, the 
acting Miner coach while Don Haskins remains home with laryngitis. "We wanted 
to play our game and they forced us to struggle the whole 45 minutes. We got 
beat by a team that will probably go a long way in this thing." 
</P>
<P>
It was the third overtime victory for the Big Ten in the NCAA tournament -- 
Ohio State and Michigan State won in overtime Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
No. 6 Syracuse 70, Coppin State 48 -- The Orangemen, who played a sloppy first 
half, used a 14-0 run in the second half to pull away from the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Thompson led second-seeded Syracuse (25-6) with 19 points and also 
spent much of the game guarding Coppin State's Reggie Isaac, who was averaging 
21.7 points but was held to six. 
</P>
<P>
Coppin State (26-7), the 15th-seeded team after winning the Mid-Eastern 
Athletic Conference tournament, lost in its first NCAA tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse, playing in its eighth consecutive NCAA tournament, went more than 
three minutes between baskets in the second half, allowing the Eagles to close 
to within 39-33 with 12:02 left. But Thompson scored six of the next 14 points 
as Syracuse opened a 53-33 lead at the 7:41 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia 75, Notre Dame 67 -- John Crotty scored 28 points and Bryant Stith 
added 21 to help extend the coaching career of Terry Holland at least one more 
game as the Cavaliers beat the Fighting Irish. 
</P>
<P>
The seventh-seeded Cavaliers (21-10) face Syracuse on Sunday. Holland, who has 
coached for 16 years at Virginia, is moving on to Davidson, his alma mater, to 
become athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish, the only independent in the 64-team tournament field, 
finished at 16-13. That's the fewest victories of anyone in the tournament.

DUKE ROUTS RICHMOND, 81-46

<P>
While most highly seeded teams have been struggling in the NCAA basketball 
tournament, Duke won its first-round game with ease, beating Richmond, 81-46, 
Friday at the Omni. 
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Blue Devils outshot the shorter Spiders, 53.4% to 31.3%, and 
outrebounded them, 46-33, giving Coach Mike Krzyzewski his 300th major college 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, they were too big, too talented, too deep and we just didn't belong 
on the same floor with them today," said Richmond Coach Dick Tarrant, whose 
tallest starter is 6 feet 5. "They took us out of everything we tried to do. 
They're a tremendous team to make us look that inept. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't in any way, shape or form match them in size or talent. Their 
second team probably would have beaten us." 
</P>
<P>
Duke (25-8) was led by 6-10 reserve center Alaa Abdelnaby, who scored 22 
points, made nine of 14 shots, took down 12 rebounds and blocked three shots in 
22 minutes in his first game of the season as a non-starter. Guard Phil 
Henderson had 19 points, five assists and six steals. 
</P>
<P>
"I never felt that at any point in the game did our intensity wane," Krzyzewski 
said. "It was high throughout. In the second half, there was incredible 
intensity. We just played very well." 
</P>
<P>
Said Abdelnaby of the Blue Devils, who ended the regular season by losing four 
of five games against Atlantic Coast Conference competition: "We realized that 
part of what was missing was enthusiasm and intensity." 
</P>
<P>
Richmond ended the season with a 22-10 record. 
</P>
<P>
St. John's 81, Temple 65 -- The Redmen used a balanced offense and took 
advantage of the Owls' poor shooting. 
</P>
<P>
St. John's (24-9) took control in the last 10 minutes of the first half, 
outscoring the cold-shooting Owls (23-5) and opening a 35-17 halftime lead. 
Temple made only 28% of its shots in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"We showed evidence of being a very young club," said Temple Coach John Chaney, 
whose starting lineup included two freshmen and two sophomores. "You have to 
establish a success pattern for young players early in the game if you expect 
them to stay in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"And what happened was, we experienced poor play and the players got down on 
themselves. You can call it fright, you can call it anxiety, you can call it 
frustration, or it could be all of the above." 
</P>
<P>
Said St. John's Coach Lou Carnesecca: "That was probably the best first half we 
played all season." 
</P>
<P>
St. John's made 60.5% of its shots and got 18 points from forward Malik Sealy, 
17 points and six assists from guard Boo Harvey, 16 points from guard Jason 
Buchanan and 14 points from center Robert Werdann. 
</P>
<P>
"You always look good when the ball goes into the basket," Carnesecca said. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody looked better in the second half than Temple guard Mark Macon, who kept 
the Owls close by scoring 27 of his 32 points and making nine of 13 shots, 
including five of six three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
But Temple (20-11) never got closer than 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas 79, Robert Morris 71 -- The second-seeded Jayhawks fought off a 
determined effort by the Colonials, who never led but never trailed by more 
than 14 points in keeping the game close. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we were out in Boise and we sat in the locker room after losing by 
34 points to Arizona and we vowed it would never happen again," said Coach 
Jarrett Durham of the Colonials, who lost to Arizona, 94-60, in a first-round 
game last March. "We were going to make some noise. We came close, but Kansas 
is a fine team. They play well together." 
</P>
<P>
Kansas (30-4) was led by Rick Calloway, who made nine of 10 shots, four of four 
free throws and scored 22 points. Kevin Pritchard had 13 points and nine 
assists and Mark Randall, Jeff Gueldner and Mike Maddox each scored 10 points 
for the Jayhawks, who made 60% of their shots. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Boyd scored 17 points and Ricky Cannon scored 13 for the 15th-seeded 
Colonials, who ended the season with a 22-8 record.

PREP BASKETBALL STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS;

<P>
MATER DEI VS. RIORDAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RECORDS -- Mater Dei (33-1), Riordan (29-2) 
</P>
<P>
SITE -- Oakland Coliseum Arena, 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
MATER DEI UPDATE -- A last-second three-point basket by guard Jason Quinn gave 
Mater Dei a 46-45 victory over Long Beach Poly in the regional championship 
last Saturday. It was the Monarchs' 25th consecutive victory and put them in 
their second state title game. Mater Dei won the 1987 state title behind the 
play of center LeRon Ellis. This year's team features a balanced attack with 
five players averaging between nine and 15.8 points per game. Guard David Boyle 
is the team's leading scorer, but forward Charlie Andres has been the 
difference in the playoffs. Andres is averaging 12 points and 12 rebounds per 
game in eight postseason games. Coach Gary McKnight, who has compiled a 226-19 
record in eight years, has missed practice this week after suffering severe 
muscle spasms in his back, but said he will be in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
RIORDAN UPDATE -- A solid defense and the one-two scoring punch of forward 
Dwayne Fontana and guard Dorian Manigo have carried Riordan to its first state 
title appearance. Riordan allowed an average of only 55.6 points per game in 
three regional games. Riordan has won 11 consecutive games. Its only losses 
this season were to Los Angeles Fremont, 76-73, in the Amador Valley tournament 
and to Archbishop Mitty, 69-66, in a West Catholic Athletic League game. 
Fontana, who has signed with Arizona State, is the team's best player. He 
averages 22 points and 12 rebounds per game. Manigo, who has signed with Cal 
State Northridge, averages 19.1 points and four rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
KEY TO THE GAME -- Mater Dei must avoid the false security that some previous 
Southern California Regional winners have taken to Oakland. Granted, Southern 
Regional winners have won eight consecutive state titles, but Northern teams 
traditionally play inspired games in front of partisan crowds. Riordan's key 
players, Fontana and Manigo, must avoid foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
CONSENSUS -- Mater Dei isn't planning to leave the Bay Area until Monday night. 
Could this mean a long victory celebration has been planned? Why not? Mater Dei 
has too much height and depth for a two-man team like Riordan's, but the game 
will be closer than most expect. Mater Dei by six.

IRISH-BRED KANATIYR CELEBRATES A DAY EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irish-bred Kanatiyr celebrated St. Patrick's Day one day early by winning 
Friday's $37,000 feature race on the Santa Anita turf course in his U.S. debut. 
</P>
<P>
Kanatiyr had raced in France last year as a 3-year-old before being bought by 
Clover Racing Stable and turned over to trainer Rick Mettee. 
</P>
<P>
Unraced since September, the son of Chief Singer had been brought up to his 
first race on American turf with outstanding workouts and was sent away as the 
3-2 favorite. He returned $5.00 after running the 1 1/8 miles in 1:47 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Chris McCarron let Kanatiyr settle at the back of a strung-out field, 
well off a torrid pace set by Timdala, then let him run going into the final 
turn. Once in full stride, Kanatiyr passed the field with ease and pulled off 
to win by three lengths over longshot Jetting Around.

BILL'S HOME RUN HELPS OCEAN VIEW TOP BARONS

FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ocean View High School's Kevin Bill will be the first to admit his 
second-inning home run against Fountain Valley Friday wasn't an awesome sight. 
</P>
<P>
He got under an inside pitch somewhat but a strong wind helped carry the ball 
over the left-field fence. Impressive or not, the hit gave Ocean View a two-run 
lead and Jim Gwaltney pitched a four-hitter as Ocean View won, 8-0, in a Sunset 
League opener. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a good, level swing," Bill said of his homer. "I was sitting back 
in the box waiting for a fastball and I got it. It wasn't the best of home 
runs, it was kind of high." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Bill, who has struggled in his first season at the varsity level, 
wasn't complaining. Ocean View Coach Steve Barrett said Bill, a junior catcher 
batting ninth in the order, was hitting about .150 entering the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it that high?" Bill said of his batting average. "I haven't been hitting 
the best. I've been trying to pull everything." 
</P>
<P>
Bill, who was two for two, added a two-run, bases-loaded single in the third 
inning to increase Ocean View's lead to 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
"This is his first year on varsity and the pitching is a little better," 
Barrett said. "We expected him to struggle at first, but he hit the ball today. 
It's great for him -- a junior in his first Sunset League game -- to go deep on 
his first at-bat. He sparked us." 
</P>
<P>
Many of Bill's teammates shared his success at the plate. Daniel Hernandez and 
Keith Herrell also had two hits. Hernandez doubled off the left-field wall in 
the second inning to give Ocean View (6-2) a 4-0 lead. The Seahawks finished 
with 11 hits. 
</P>
<P>
The lead was safe with Gwaltney (3-0), who struck out five. 
</P>
<P>
"I just used my split-fingered fastball, kept them off-balance," Gwaltney said. 
"That's been working all season and I'll stick with it until something 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
Gwaltney, a 6-foot-5 left-handed senior, pitched around trouble much of the 
game. Fountain Valley (3-5) had runners in scoring position in four of the 
first five innings. 
</P>
<P>
"They dominated us in every area of the game," Fountain Valley Coach Ron 
LaRuffa said. "We had the opportunities. We just didn't clutch up with runners 
on base." 
</P>
<P>
In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach 6, Edison 0 -- Kenny Mays pitched his second consecutive 
shutout and James Marietti had two RBIs to lead visiting Huntington Beach (6-4, 
1-0). Mays (2-1), a senior left-hander, allowed six hits and struck out seven. 
The senior also shut out Loara in the Loara tournament on March 5. Edison 
dropped to 5-2, 0-1. 
</P>
<P>
Marina 5, Westminster 2 -- Marc Newfield had a solo home run and a sacrifice 
fly for visiting Marina (3-4-1, 1-0). Robin Lindsey, David Schultz and Travis 
Boyd each had two hits and scored a run for Marina. Westminster is 2-6, 0-1.

Valley Conference track meet Friday at San Fernando.

POP BEAT: RICKIE LEE JONES' REAL PEOPLE ARE AT LINGERIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rickie Lee Jones scanned the crowd near the Club Lingerie stage after her first 
number in the first of two shows there Thursday, hoping to see some 
non-familiar (i.e., non-"industry") faces in the footlights. "I was hoping very 
much that some real people got in, 'cause I was trying to figure out who bought 
the tickets," she said earnestly, beaming that Cheshire Cat grin as the whoops 
and hollers told her the folks wuz real. 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy for a star of Jones' magnitude to put on a "Saloon Tour" (so 
deemed in honor of her recent "Flying Cowboys" album) -- one that hits only 
nine cities and includes almost exclusively club dates, the exception being 
this Monday's Wiltern show -- and get the relatively few dance cards available 
into the hands of the cowpokes rather than the cattle barons, as it were. 
Amazingly, it seems to have worked. 
</P>
<P>
Not that this was a downscale crowd. Jones' most devoted fans may be those lost 
souls who live out their bohemianism vicariously through her jivey, jazzy, 
soulful music. Forget the Western similes that have been cropping up in Jones' 
metaphoric saddle for a moment: The theme song for this evening, and for many 
fans' identification, would surely be the slow, buoyant, urban funkiness of 
"Ghetto of My Mind," a good representation of just how Jones takes listeners to 
a looser landscape they may never know. Even as a settled-down mom, she still 
makes a great, cosmic conduit to The Street. 
</P>
<P>
Swigging bottled water and full of offhand comments, Jones seemed quite 
cheerful on this stop, trotting out oldies like "Chuck E.'s in Love" without 
provocation in the midst of a set that included most of the "Cowboys" material. 
Her six-man band -- which provided occasional trumpet or cello in addition to 
the basics -- proved as tight and full of good, subtle licks as would be 
expected of any of her congregates, if it's far from the most fiery unit she's 
toured with. It's hard for any Jones show to live up to its celebratory 
potential without a full horn section, but this one had its grooves. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who's seen a rare Jones solo show (as if any kind of Jones show hasn't 
been a rarity) probably treasures those moments most of all, and the best ones 
at the Lingerie came with the slow buildup and quiet denouement. Before 
settling into more upbeat material, she took her sweet time getting the pace 
going, nicely concentrating on such low-key numbers as "Rodeo Girl," 
"Coolsville," "Night Train" and her signature masterpiece, "We Belong 
Together." 
</P>
<P>
At performance's end, she sang "Autumn Leaves" with just piano and upright 
bass, assuring those who might not have known that, at heart and in spirit, she 
really is a phenomenal jazz singer. The show could have used more such intimate 
reminders, but even in a reggae number or a near-samba, Jones is always playing 
with the phrasing, suggesting weeping, giggling or bravado with the slightest 
slur or vocal distortion or octave change. It goes without saying that there's 
no saloon singer like her. 
</P>
<P>
All of Jones' shows, including appearances Sunday at the Ventura Theatre and 
Monday at the Wiltern, are sold out. CHRIS WILLMAN

A SWEET CRITIC? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Martin Bernheimer's review of Garrison Keillor at the Philharmonic 
pension fund benefit (March 14): Lordy, Lordy. 
</P>
<P>
Self-effacing, gentle and sweet are the only words that can apply. Not to 
Keillor's performance, but to the review. 
</P>
<P>
Bernheimer must have arisen from the right side of the sleeping apparatus 
(there are those who'd swear it's a Torquemadic contraption involving spikes, 
judging from the tone of some of his writings). 
</P>
<P>
A night of discovery and appreciation outside the more rarefied strata of 
traditionally "meaningful" musical efforts, from the Beckmesser-meister? "It 
was a lovely evening." It was a lovely review.

DECEPTIVE 'INFOMERCIALS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Given that my profession -- public relations -- has a reputation for 
"deceiving" the public, it may be surprising that I am disgusted by TV 
"infomercials" ("Amazing Discovery: These Shows Are Ads" by Howard Rosenberg, 
March 12). 
</P>
<P>
Every one of these programs -- whether it sells hair-loss cure-alls or 
sunglasses that enables one to see behind himself (wow, what a necessary 
product!) -- uses phases such as "our researchers" or "leading medical 
authorities" without substantiation and rebuttal. 
</P>
<P>
When a print ad closely resembles a news article, the notice "Paid 
Advertisement" is clearly visible. Why don't infomercials have "Paid 
Advertisement" running constantly -- or frequently -- across the bottom of the 
screen? 
</P>
<P>
Such notices at the beginning and end of each program are not enough, because 
many viewers tune in late or cut out early.

'THE HANDMAID'S TALE' AS A COMMENTARY ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his on-the-mark review of "The Handmaid's Tale" (March 7), Peter Rainer 
refers to abortion only once, somewhat obliquely. 
</P>
<P>
Did he miss the fact that the movie was an attempt to be a commentary on 
abortion? Or was he just confused about what the message was and therefore left 
the subject untouched? If so, I don't blame him. 
</P>
<P>
The only way I knew the film was a pro-abortion effort was because the 
director, Volker Schlondorff, spoke at the Los Angeles premiere and made his 
intent clear. 
</P>
<P>
The movie backfired on him, though. The dismal future world it portrays is one 
that is the logical extension of unfettered abortion. If every woman is 
entitled to abortion, then all women are entitled to abortion, and we have 
delegated to pregnant women the right to extinguish the species. In the film, 
only 1 in 100 women can have children; it's a short step from that to "1 in 100 
will have a child."

A LOOK AT 'SUPER CHIEF' JUSTICE WARREN'S WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems long overdue that a documentary film be made on the remarkable career 
of Earl Warren who presided over the United States Supreme Court spanning the 
terms of four presidents, from 1954 to 1969. Even if the Warren Court had not 
handed down some of American history's most controversial decisions -- ranging 
from integration of public schools to voting rights to the rights of the 
accused -- Warren's service in public life would still be a rarity; he was a 
public servant about whom nary a blemish of compromise or taint could be 
uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
That, at least, is the position of "Super Chief -- The Life and Legacy of Earl 
Warren," a quality examination of Warren's career by producers Bill Jersey and 
Judith Leonard, with the comforting, authoritative narration of Gregory Peck. 
The producers do not go easy on Warren, however. They give voice to many of his 
most severe critics and utilize footage of the torrent of anti-Warren emotions 
that swept the nation in the wake of the high court's major decisions. 
</P>
<P>
News reel clips show former Arkansas governor Orval Faubus attacking the Warren 
Court's 1954 Brown vs. the Board of Education decision which declared that 
"separate but equal" public schools were unconstitutional. There is footage of 
conservatives Lino Graglia, a law professor at the University of Texas Law 
School, and of retired circuit judge Robert Bork (a one-time Supreme Court 
nominee) voicing their objections to Warren Court decisions. Bork is 
particularly offended by the court's ruling on reapportionment, known as 
"one-person, one vote," that shifted political power in many states from rural 
districts to urban ones. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most telling example of Warren's consistency was the case of his 
own father's murder in Bakersfield. When Warren, then California Attorney 
General, learned that the accused man had not been apprised of his rights, he 
dropped all interest in the case and the man was released. It wasn't surprising 
that in the '60s the Warren Court handed down the controversial Miranda 
decision, outlining the rights of the accused. DAVID J. FOX

'THE ROSE SHRINE' HAS LOCAL COLOR BUT STILL NEEDS WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first new play offered by the New Place Theatre Company, which is based at 
the Norris Theatre in the Palos Verdes hills, has a nearby setting: Long Beach. 
In "The Rose Shrine," a couple finally scrapes together enough money for a 
house on the other side of the hills, in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The play's most affecting moment is when we see the lights of the Pike, Long 
Beach's legendary amusement park, go on to mark the end of World War II -- 
while hearts are breaking in the foreground. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Nora Boland Ullrich's play has lots of local color. It also has 
some engaging characters, too much self-consciously fancy language, a handsome 
set (designed by Robert L. Smith), and professional actors who don't appear 
sufficiently rehearsed. 
</P>
<P>
It's the story of Maddy McNerney (Hope Alexander-Willis), a fierce, 
middle-aged, Irish-American grandmother. She's a tough bird: an apostate 
Catholic and an outspoken opponent of any war, including the big one that's 
raging. She hasn't recovered from the death of her older son in World War I; 
she keeps a shrine to him in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
Her younger son (Patrick St. Esprit) and his wife (Dendrie Taylor) would like 
to get on with their own life, but they can't afford to get out from under 
Maddy's wing. 
</P>
<P>
The story is told by Maddy's granddaughter Nonie, looking back as an adult 
(Stephanie Dunnam) and observing herself as a young teen-ager (Lisa Picotte). 
Her brother (Ian Romeyn) is about to go off to war, much to his grandmother's 
horror. 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad the boy and his parents made up their minds about his enlistment 
before the play begins. He exists primarily to utter flowery and foreboding 
speeches to his sister before he ships out. 
</P>
<P>
But the torment that Maddy goes through, as she learns of the boy's plans and 
then tries to cope with a gentlemanly suitor (Will Macmillan) who's also a Navy 
officer, is eloquently evoked by the script and by Alexander-Willis. 
</P>
<P>
Maddy's son and daughter-in-law are almost unbelievably juvenile. They got 
married in their mid-teens, and after nearly two decades, they still can't take 
their hands off each other. It's cute, but their maturing in the second act 
isn't very convincing. 
</P>
<P>
The pacing lags. Dorothy Lyman directed.

 At Crossfield Drive and Indian Peak Road, Rolling Hills Estates, today at 2:30 
p.m. and 8:30 p.m.; Sunday at 2:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. $19-$27.50; (213) 544-0403.

ENVIRONMENTAL DESPAIR FOCUS OF ROSENTHAL'S 'L.O.W. IN GAIA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A citified, feistily independent 60-year-old woman spends three weeks traveling 
through the Mohave Desert and encounters the devastating incarnation of Gaia, 
the Earth goddess, in her dying days. 
</P>
<P>
Rachel Rosenthal's "L.O.W. in Gaia," seen Thursday night at Los Angeles 
Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE), is a histrionic tour de force, encompassing 
wryly down-to-earth narration and the fires of declamatory rage. 
</P>
<P>
This 1986 piece about environmental despair -- with significant asides about 
human aging -- is not wholly successful. But it falters in a grand way, in 
keeping with the stature of its writer and performer. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in casual clothes, Rosenthal first appears as a toddling, open-mouthed 
bird jerking in a constellation of tiny, alert movements. Later the bird will 
reappear, chirping happily as it clumsily collects the bright shards of nuclear 
waste warning signs scattered on the stage floor. 
</P>
<P>
As herself, Rosenthal sets up a Sterno stove to boil water while she describes 
a rite-of-passage adventure on her desert vacation. She is a Loner On Wheels. 
To the strains of Erik Satie's "Parade," she rakishly reviews her 
self-sufficient daily routine in the bus. An airily swooping arm demonstrates 
the use of the toilet tissues she carefully preserves in plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
She rhapsodizes about the simple life and the look of nature. She sees "the 
quail in their '50s Dior hats," fixing the image with a curving index finger 
above her head. And then her self-absorbed fancies are cut short by the Death 
Crone. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal's crone is a rather static but formidable presence with a 
squared-off, pugilistic stance, slashing arms, clenched fists and a growling 
voice. She unleashes a litany of accusations ("You drove me mad!") with the 
rolling thunder of an epic poem. 
</P>
<P>
Herself again, Rosenthal returns with the ballooning plastic bags -- which keep 
accumulating -- attached like millstones to her body. Stepping with a 
tight-rope walker's grace, she rues that she cannot "tread lightly on the land 
as one tiptoes around a sickbed." 
</P>
<P>
Her despair becomes a great howl of rage against the dying Earth, sometimes 
underlined by Igor Stravinsky's "Symphony of Psalms." But the outburst is 
ultimately an abstraction of passion, akin to the frozen declamations of 
classical French theater. The rhetorical gestures, the soaring language, the 
rich, full voice all rage on and on, yet the viewer's emotions are not engaged. 
</P>
<P>
The piece makes ample use of projected photographs of pristine rock formations 
and polluted desert sites, brightly colored semi-abstract paintings and 
sometimes obscure-sounding texts on the subject of nuclear waste. But the 
images that stick in the mind are six decades of photographs of the evolution 
of Rosenthal's own face. 
</P>
<P>
Performances continue today and Sunday, and Thursday through March 25.

POP BEAT: FRANKIE BEVERLY, MAZE GIVE TRIED-AND-TRUE R&amp;B 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The best thing about R&amp;B singer Frankie Beverly is that he's not trying to 
be Bobby Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by his band Maze, Beverly, who opened a four-night engagement at the 
Universal Amphitheater on Thursday, is an R&amp;B veteran who's satisfied 
working in the genre's venerated, tried-and-true style. 
</P>
<P>
The result was one of the best R&amp;B shows to come to town in years. 
</P>
<P>
It had everything -- impeccable musicianship and gutsy, sensuous mid-tempo 
groove-orientation. On songs like "Silky Soul" and "Love's on the Run," Beverly 
showed off his high, rich voice, falling somewhere between James Brown and 
Marvin Gaye -- silky-smooth, yet decidedly funky. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly is one of the few veterans who realize that 40-ish singers look silly 
trying to get into that youthful hip-hop groove. He's a throwback to the days 
when singers could really sing -- back in that prehistoric age before music 
videos and the limited vocal demands of dance music opened the doors to cute, 
limber non-singers. Accordingly, Thursday night's audience was mostly a black 
yuppie crowd. Too bad more teen-agers weren't there to see what R&amp;B can be 
like in the hands of an artist who knows what he's doing. 
</P>
<P>
Regina Belle, who opened the show with an absorbing set, is the best R&amp;B 
balladeer this side of Anita Baker. Belle's style, with its gospel and jazz 
influences, is perfectly suited to intense, anguished romantic ballads, which 
she attacks with incredible power and feeling. The primary difference between 
Belle and Baker is that Baker has somewhat better songs. DENNIS HUNT

DAY HIKE: A SMALL REMINDER OF PASTORAL 18TH-CENTURY CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the map, the new Arroyo Trabuco addition to O'Neill Regional Park in Orange 
County looks inspiring. A long green finger shaped like the Mediterranean 
island of Crete extends from the main part of the park all the way to Mission 
Viejo. Along the bottom of a tranquil canyon a 5-mile trail beckons. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, as many a great explorer has discovered, the map is not the territory. 
O'Neill Regional Park is every bit as big and green as it is pictured on the 
maps; however, the park's nicest section, Arroyo Trabuco, is almost completely 
fenced off and closed to public use. Only a small part of the arroyo is open to 
hikers. 
</P>
<P>
Pending lawsuits against Orange County concerning two mountain lion attacks in 
nearby Caspers Regional Park prompted the county parks department to restrict 
use of wild areas, including Arroyo Trabuco. And while lawyers argue and park 
planners plan, Arroyo Trabuco is being lined with subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
According to historical accounts, a soldier marching with Gaspar de Portola's 
1769 expedition lost his firearm in this hilly region. He no doubt would be 
astonished at the number of Orange County place names inspired by his mistake. 
Trabuco, which means "blunderbuss" in Spanish, names a canyon, a creek, a 
plain, a trail, a road and even a ranger district of the Cleveland National 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
If that unknown soldier hiked this way again, he would be amazed at the drastic 
changes in the land. But he might recognize part of Trabuco Canyon, where the 
modern trekker can explore a small slice of the pastoral Southern California of 
two centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
A good way to learn about the ecology of Trabuco Canyon is to walk the park's 
nature trail. Trabuco Creek Trail, with stops keyed to a pamphlet available at 
the park's entry station, meanders through an oak and sycamore woodland and 
explores Plano Trabuco, or Trabuco Flat, a level alluvial surface deposited by 
runoff from the Santa Ana Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead:: From the San Diego Freeway (Interstate 5) in El Toro, 
exit on El Toro Road and drive 7 1/2 miles to Live Oak Canyon Road. Turn right 
and proceed 3 miles to O'Neill Regional Park. There is a $2 vehicle entry fee. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors are asked to sign a Park Use Permit and Waiver of Liability. Anyone 
under 18 must be supervised by an adult. 
</P>
<P>
Park in the day-use lot near the entrance. Cross the usually dry Trabuco Creek 
over a cement spillway and pick up the signed trail on the far bank. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: The nature trail explores what botanists call a riparian area, 
characterized by the lush growth of creek-side vegetation. You'll walk under 
oaks and sycamores and be treated to a view of the twin mile-high peaks of Old 
Saddleback -- Mt. Modjeska and Mt. Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Creek, which relies on winter rains for replenishment, is dry this 
year. During a wet year, Trabuco Creek flows from its headwaters on the 
shoulders of Old Saddleback about 40 miles through Trabuco Canyon and southern 
Orange County to its confluence with San Juan Creek, 2 1/2 miles from the 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
At signpost No. 17 of the nature trail, you can leave the loop and continue up 
creek. The arroyo opens up and you get a good view to the south of Trabuco Flat 
-- a mesa sculpted by the floodwaters of Arroyo Trabuco. On weekdays, the 
intrusive sounds of bulldozers and construction -- from more than 2 miles away 
-- resound through the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The trail joins a man-made berm on the left side of the arroyo. You can step 
off the trail to a picnic area near the group camps or continue to the Live Oak 
Canyon Road bridge. Return the same way.

JUSTICES MOVE HARRIS A STEP CLOSER TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court on Friday rejected a last-ditch appeal by condemned 
killer Robert Alton Harris, refusing to block his scheduled execution April 3 
and removing one of the last major obstacles to California's first imposition 
of capital punishment since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
The justices unanimously declined to grant a formal hearing to Harris to review 
his claim that new psychiatric evidence shows he had suffered brain damage that 
could have affected his behavior in the killing of two San Diego youths in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
If Harris is to avoid execution, he now must obtain an 11th-hour hearing in the 
federal courts -- or win a reprieve from Gov. George Deukmejian, who will 
preside over a March 27 clemency hearing to decide whether Harris' sentence 
should be reduced to life in prison without parole. As a state senator, 
Deukmejian sponsored legislation in 1977 that reinstated capital punishment in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Among the cases involving more than 270 inmates now on Death Row at San Quentin 
state prison, Harris' case has advanced furthest in the complex and 
time-consuming capital appeals process. If he is unsuccessful in his latest bid 
for life, he will become the first prisoner executed in California since Aaron 
C. Mitchell went to the gas chamber 23 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The high court's rejection of Harris' appeal came in a brief order signed by 
Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas. None of the seven court members dissented. 
</P>
<P>
Charles M. Sevilla of San Diego, an attorney for Harris, expressed 
disappointment and said an appeal will be filed next week in federal district 
court in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, I'm still optimistic we are going to get some relief in the 
courts," he said. "We believe our showing (on the need for retrial) has been 
very strong." 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla rejected suggestions that the claims of mental disorder were merely 
"last-minute" contentions. He said defense lawyers had sought for several years 
to obtain court funds -- as permitted for indigent defendants -- to conduct 
neurological examinations of Harris. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, he said, the defense paid for such an examination "out of our 
own pockets" and found further indications that Harris had suffered damage to 
the frontal lobe -- a finding that would strengthen claims he was unable to 
control his impulses and should not have been found guilty of first-degree 
murder and sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a very relevant fact the jury should have had placed before it," 
Sevilla said. "To this day, Robert does not know why he did it." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's action, however, was welcomed by Deputy Atty. Gen. Louis R. Hanoian, 
one of a team of state prosecutors who urged the court to uphold the impending 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's evident that the state Supreme Court found the same lack of merit we 
found in this appeal," Hanoian said. "It's unlikely the court would hereafter 
grant a stay in this case." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp said that at this point in the 
proceedings, Harris has "had more than his day in court." Harris' appeals over 
the years "have been addressed fairly and rejected by our courts," Van de Kamp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hanoian added that he expected the same issues to be raised by the defense in 
subsequent federal court proceedings and expressed hope that those courts, too, 
would reject the claims. 
</P>
<P>
If Harris fails in his bid for reprieve in federal district court, he can file 
subsequent appeals in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. 
Supreme Court. But, as his execution date draws closer, such last-ditch moves 
are widely seen as less and less likely to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 37, was convicted and sentenced to death in March, 1979, in the fatal 
shootings of Michael Baker and John Mayeski, both 16. According to authorities, 
Harris gunned down the boys after he and his brother abducted them and stole 
their car to use in a subsequent bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Harris' appeals, raising a wide range of legal issues, have 
been rejected four times each by the California and U.S. Supreme Courts. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest challenge, defense lawyers do not contend that Harris was legally 
insane at the time of the crime, but instead that he suffered from a series of 
mental disorders that could have reduced his culpability in the killings but 
were not properly explored at the time of trial. 
</P>
<P>
His attorneys, in briefs filed with the court, said a recent psychological 
examination of Harris indicated that "organic brain damage" and other disorders 
caused him to act impulsively in the killings, rather than with the 
deliberation and premeditation required in cases of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
They claimed further that a psychiatrist for the prosecution presented "false 
testimony" that Harris, as a sociopath, could not be rehabilitated. Such a 
theory has since been disproved, they said, adding that Harris' exemplary 
behavior as a prisoner since his conviction refuted such an analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the defense lawyers also argued that Harris was entitled to 
a reprieve because of his psychologically and physically arduous, 11-year 
confinement on Death Row. Any delays in the appeals process over the years were 
not his fault, the attorneys said, and such prolonged incarceration as a 
condemned prisoner violated the constitutional ban against cruel and unusual 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
In response, state prosecutors urged the court to refuse to halt the execution, 
saying Harris was presenting "tired, repetitive" legal claims that already had 
been examined and rejected in previous appeals. "Enough is enough," the state 
lawyers said in a brief to the court. "It is time to execute the sentence long 
ago imposed and repeatedly upheld." 
</P>
<P>
The state also defended the prosecution's psychiatric evidence presented at 
trial, saying the defense had distorted the psychiatrist's testimony and that 
it was not "false," but merely a different assessment from that of the defense. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys for the state said Harris' claim that he had suffered cruel and 
unusual punishment was "so preposterous as to leave one breathless." His 
prolonged confinement on Death Row was attributable to delays he himself had 
injected in the appeal process, they said.

ANDERSON'S KIN MARK HIS 5 YEARS AS HOSTAGE 
</P>

<P>
Family, friends and colleagues of Associated Press correspondent Terry A. 
Anderson gathered at Lafayette Park on Friday to mark an anniversary they had 
hoped to never see. 
</P>
<P>
On March 16, 1985, after playing an early morning tennis match with an AP 
colleague, Anderson was kidnaped from a Beirut street. 
</P>
<P>
Friday marked the end of his fifth year in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, both his father and his brother have died of cancer. He has never 
seen his daughter, who will turn 5 in June. 
</P>
<P>
The solemn ceremony, held across the street from the White House, also brought 
together the families of the seven other Americans who were kidnaped after 
Anderson and are still held in Lebanon. There were songs, prayers and 
remembrances, expressions of outrage and hope. 
</P>
<P>
But noticeably absent was any evidence that the hostages would be released 
soon. Just two weeks ago, anticipation of a possible release intensified when 
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said he saw the hostage ordeal "moving 
toward a solution." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, the mood has turned sour. The Iranian president openly 
mocked President Bush last week for having accepted a phone call, said to be 
from Rafsanjani, that turned out to be a hoax. The Iranian news media have 
begun referring to the hostages again as American "spies." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the terrorist group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the 
Liberation of Palestine released a statement threatening to execute three 
American professors who were taken hostage in 1987: Robert Polhill, Alann Steen 
and Jesse Turner. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters Friday whether he had any optimistic news for the families 
of the hostages, Bush demurred. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get the hopes up through a lot of speculation and have them 
dashed down," the President said. "I respect the families too much to do that." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any breakthroughs we can report," added White House Press 
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the Iranian regime said they see no reason to believe that a 
hostage release is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
"They use them (hostages) as a card to play for internal political purposes," 
said Alireza Jafarzadeh, a spokesman for the Moujahedeen, the principal Iranian 
opposition group. "It's just not in their interest to release the hostages. The 
weaker the regime gets, the more they need them." 
</P>
<P>
Bush declined to appear at Friday's ceremony across from the White House, but 
he and his wife, Barbara, met for half an hour with Anderson's sister, Peggy 
Say. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Say, which she released, Bush expressed his "great sorrow at . . 
. your brother's merciless imprisonment." 
</P>
<P>
Bush told reporters: "I'm going to do everything I can to get those hostages 
out of there, sometimes privately, sometimes publicly." 
</P>
<P>
Say, who in the past has criticized U.S. officials over the lack of progress on 
the hostage issue, said she was reassured that Bush is doing all he can. She 
also said she had "faith" that all the hostages would be released "in the 
coming weeks." 
</P>
<P>
The Lafayette Park ceremony was sponsored by "No Greater Love," a 
Washington-based support group for the families of the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow flowers were placed beside the names of the nine Western hostages who 
are known to have been slain in Lebanon since 1985. Then, young children came 
forth, one by one, carrying photos of some of the Westerners who are still held 
hostage in Lebanon. Including the eight Americans, they number at least 16. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Anderson's friends and colleagues attended a Mass at St. Patrick's 
Cathedral. At press clubs in Tokyo, where Anderson worked for four years, and 
in Washington and Brussels, journalists gathered to raise a symbolically empty 
glass as a toast in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, former hostages Jean-Paul Kauffman and Roger Auque put on blindfolds 
and chained themselves to a tree outside the Iranian Embassy to protest 
Anderson's captivity. The two were among 10 French hostages released by their 
captors in Lebanon between 1986 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Kauffman and Auque were silent during their protest but said in a statement: 
"We have taken this action so people know how Terry Anderson is living at this 
moment. He is chained. He wears a blindfold over his eyes. He must be silent. 
This is how we were. This is how he is today." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Damascus, former President Jimmy Carter met Friday with Syrian 
President Hafez Assad and also expressed optimism about the fate of the 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"I see movement now . . . better chances than those I have seen for several 
years," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, local television stations marked the anniversary of Anderson's 
capture by playing a videotape of his daughter, Sulome. The child was shown 
demonstrating her ballet dancing and told her father: "I love you, Daddy. Come 
home. Please come home. Send me to the circus." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter published by seven Beirut newspapers, Anderson's wife, Madeline 
Bassil, told her husband that she and their daughter also feel like hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in as much captivity, Terry, only our living space is bigger here and 
it's shared by millions. . . . A home without a husband or father is not a 
home, it's hell." 
</P>
<P>
The families of the hostages have received little news of their condition other 
than an occasional -- and often distressing -- photo.

FORMER AIDE DESCRIBES POINDEXTER'S MISTRUST OF CONGRESS MEMBERS; 
</P>
<P>
IRAN-CONTRA: THE TRIAL TESTIMONY COMES AS THE PROSECUTION BEGINS TO WRAP UP ITS 
CASE AGAINST THE FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER. 
</P>

<P>
Former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter, on trial in federal court 
on charges of obstructing and lying to Congress during the Iran-Contra affair, 
was described by a former aide Friday as a bureaucrat who did not trust 
congressmen and did not like to deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
"Adm. Poindexter was skeptical of the Congress," testified Ronald Sable, the 
official on Poindexter's staff who handled the National Security Council's 
relations with Congress. "He had not had anything to do with them, and that 
remained his preference. He would just as soon not deal with them. He indicated 
he did not trust them." 
</P>
<P>
Under cross examination, the witness acknowledged, as defense attorney Richard 
Beckler put it, that Sable "had to tug him (Poindexter) along and get him a 
little bit more interested in Congress." But this did not soften the image very 
much of a security official in the White House who did not believe Congress 
ought to pry into his secrets. 
</P>
<P>
The description came as the prosecution began wrapping up its case. Prosecutor 
Dan K. Webb said he plans to conclude Monday, with final witnesses called to 
supply a few final touches. 
</P>
<P>
The members of the jury, who listened to a hesitant and leaden Oliver L. North 
testify for four straight days at the start of the trial, received a different, 
far more kinetic picture of North from Sable. North organized both the sale of 
arms to Iran and the diversion of profits from these sales to the Contras 
fighting in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Sable described North as "someone who, when he wanted to get something done, 
would get it done but might not care about how he did it." 
</P>
<P>
"I once told Ollie," Sable went on, "if we wanted to get to the other side of a 
wall, you would get there first but you might not check to see if there is a 
door." 
</P>
<P>
In reply to questions from defense attorney Beckler, Sable also described North 
as someone "who occasionally misled me." As one instance, a vital part of the 
case against Poindexter, Sable cited North's meeting with members of the House 
Intelligence Committee in the White House Situation Room in August, 1986. Sable 
and Robert Pearson, then deputy general counsel of the National Security 
Council, attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Pearson, who also testified Friday, said North told the congressmen at the 
meeting that, while he had met with leaders of the Contras in Central America, 
he had nothing to do with arming them -- an act prohibited by Congress. "All 
that he did," Pearson quoted North as telling the congressmen, "was for the 
purpose of gathering information for the benefit of the President of the United 
States in carrying out foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting has been brought up repeatedly at the trial because North testified 
that he lied to the congressmen at the request of Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
The congressmen accepted North's account without challenging it. In fact, they 
were so seduced by North's false tale that they quashed a proposed resolution 
for an investigation into the activities of North. North seemed confident at 
the meeting, both Sable and Pearson testified, and Poindexter appeared pleased 
with the results. 
</P>
<P>
Beckler drew many details from Pearson about the setting for North's lies. 
Pearson said that the congressmen and officials had sat around the walls of the 
room and around a table in the center of the White House Situation Room and 
that North had occupied the seat usually reserved for the President. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Harold H. Greene smiled at Beckler's accumulation of these details and 
then remarked: "I take it Oliver North did not issue any proclamations while he 
was sitting in the President's chair."

NORTHWEST FIRES 3 PILOTS ACCUSED OF FLYING WHILE LEGALLY DRUNK

Northwest Airlines on Friday fired three pilots accused of flying while legally 
intoxicated, saying the cockpit crew violated company rules by operating the 
jetliner within 12 hours of drinking. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the pilots on the 6:25 a.m. flight from Fargo, N. D., on March 8 had 
blood-alcohol levels exceeding 0.04%, a violation of federal regulations, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
"Northwest pilots have established a reputation for airmanship and safety," 
spokesman Alan Muncaster said. "All of us at Northwest are now challenged to 
win back our reputation for flight excellence." 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration had already revoked the pilots' licenses 
after its own investigation showed that the cockpit crew boarded the flight 
within eight hours of drinking, the federal limit. Northwest imposes a stricter 
span of 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest Flight 650, carrying 91 passengers, landed safely at the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, where the cockpit crew was 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Dismissed were Capt. Norman Prouse, 51, of Conyers, Ga.; 1st Officer Robert 
Kirchner, 35, of Highland Ranch, Colo., and 2nd Officer Joseph Balzer, 34, of 
Antioch, Tenn. None of the three have any previous alcohol or drug-related 
incidents on their flying records, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Line Pilots Assn., the union representing Northwest's 5,400 pilots and 
about 36,600 other pilots, issued a statement Friday saying it has "no 
tolerance whatsoever toward drugs or alcohol in the cockpit." 
</P>
<P>
But the statement emphasized that the three pilots are entitled to a fair 
hearing on the charges. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board has scheduled an appeals hearing 
before an administrative law judge April 3-6 for the three crew members.

SEN. MITCHELL SAYS 'BLUNDER' BY BUSH CONTRIBUTED TO SPLINTERING OF ISRAELI 
COALITION; 
</P>

POLITICS: DEMOCRAT LAUNCHES ATTACK OVER COMMENTS ON THE SENSITIVE ISSUE OF EAST 
JERUSALEM'S FUTURE.

<P>
In a strongly worded attack, Senate Democratic Leader George J. Mitchell 
accused President Bush on Friday of a "heavy-handed blunder" that contributed 
to the downfall of the Israeli government when he raised the issue of East 
Jerusalem's future status. 
</P>
<P>
"His remarks have contributed to the recent political crisis in Israel and have 
cast doubt upon America's intentions and role in promoting peace in the Middle 
East," Mitchell (D-Me.) said in a statement. "A more heavy-handed blunder is 
difficult to imagine." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, speaking at a March 3 news conference in Palm Springs, voiced opposition 
to settlements by Soviet Jews in predominantly Arab East Jerusalem, which 
Israel captured in 1967 and subsequently annexed. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush's comments were consistent with longstanding U.S. policy, U.S. 
officials generally have refrained from discussing East Jerusalem because its 
future status is one of the most sensitive issues facing the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
Although a number of American Jewish organizations have been highly critical of 
the President's remarks 13 days ago, Mitchell's broadside was the first 
Democratic move to reap political benefit from the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate leader's response came a day after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir's government fell on a parliamentary vote of no confidence, reflecting 
its refusal to accept an American plan to start peace talks with the 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, responding to a 
reporter's question, declined to acknowledge that the President's remarks had 
contributed to the downfall of the Israeli coalition government headed by 
Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously there is a pause in moving the peace process forward," Tutwiler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She added, however: "The vote in the Knesset (Thursday) clearly reflected a 
focus on the peace issue and the importance of moving forward. . . . The 
Israeli government has fallen and Israel's constitutional processes will come 
into effect. It will now take some time for a new government to be formed. This 
is an exclusively Israeli matter that only Israelis can work out." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Mitchell said he decided to speak out, nearly two weeks after 
Bush made his comments on East Jerusalem, because of press inquiries regarding 
his view of the controversy. The statement was issued after a series of 
fund-raising appearances in California for the Senate Democratic Campaign 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
While most Democratic and Republican politicians take a pro-Israeli stance, 
Mitchell's statement seemed likely to win more favor among American Jews and 
other Israeli sympathizers than the President's position. 
</P>
<P>
Israel says that it annexed East Jerusalem and will never give it up. But U.S. 
policy regards the area as occupied territory, with its final status subject to 
negotiation during peace talks with Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush simply restated American policy in effect since 1967, the timing 
of his remarks at a crucial stage in the drawn-out peace process has been 
regarded as a mistake by foreign policy specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir has implied that Bush's comment was the final straw that led to the 
collapse of Israel's coalition government. Many Bush Administration officials 
believe, however, that Shamir's hard-line resistance to American 
recommendations for peace talks with Palestinians was equally to blame for the 
government's fall. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell praised the Bush Administration for paving the way for the Mideast 
peace process through consultations with Israel and Egypt that built trust on 
all sides. But he said the President's remarks have undermined that progress. 
</P>
<P>
"There was simply no reason to suddenly thrust into the forefront of debate the 
issue of Jewish Israelis' rights to live in East Jerusalem," Mitchell said.

ROH REPLACES ECONOMICS MINISTER

President Roh Tae Woo today replaced his economics minister in a major Cabinet 
reshuffle expected to herald a push to speed the growth of South Korea's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle, affecting 15 of 22 posts, had been expected since last month's 
merger of Roh's governing party with two centrist opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance resulted in a powerful conservative party giving the president a 
comfortable parliamentary majority. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kang Young Hoon and his entire 22-member Cabinet resigned Friday 
to give Roh a free hand to reorganize the government. Kang was renamed prime 
minister of the new Cabinet today. 
</P>
<P>
However, Roh replaced most of the Cabinet's economics officials, including 
Economic Planning Minister Cho Soon, who is a deputy prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Seung Yun, 58, a former finance minister, succeeded Cho as the nation's top 
economic planner. 
</P>
<P>
His appointment is expected to bring a considerable change in South Korea's 
economic policy, which has emphasized distribution rather than growth. Lee, a 
respected economist, is known as an advocate of a growth-oriented policy. 
</P>
<P>
The state television KBS said the new economic planning minister will push a 
series of bold measures to encourage investment and stimulate exports.

Thousands of East Germans scrambled to buy a real-life Cold War thriller Friday 
as the newly published secrets of the disbanded secret police became that 
nation's best-selling book. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people stood in line for hours to buy the little yellow volume, 
eager to know how they had been spied on and lied to in decades of hard-line 
Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to publish was made by the interim government. However, "Orders 
and Reports of the Ministry of State Security" is not light reading or 
particularly engaging prose. 
</P>
<P>
The book is an edited selection, in the original police bureaucratic jargon, of 
the workings, targets and findings of the hated Stasi, or secret police, that 
imposed Stalinist order in East Germany for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The 56 reports in the paperback, which costs about $2, are all labeled Streng 
Geheim -- Top Secret. 
</P>
<P>
But the main secret they contain is the force's paranoia and alarm at every 
suspicion of change in a monolithic state, now in transition to becoming a 
multi-party democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Every dissident worth his salt can find his or her name in the 250-page book. 
Western correspondents get a mention, too. 
</P>
<P>
Millions more files are still sealed under police guard at the force's vast 
former headquarters in East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Co-publisher Stefan Wolle, laughing delightedly at the "crazy" demand for his 
book, said he had been given carte blanche to go through the files.

SURVIVAL: CHURCH LEADERS SAY THEY NEEDED TO CONDUCT A PRACTICE RUN. TRAFFIC AND 
SEWAGE PROBLEMS KEEP COUNTY OFFICIALS IN MONTANA BUSY.

Thousands of members of the controversial Church Universal and Triumphant, who 
have been gathering in a Montana valley just north of Yellowstone National Park 
in preparation for what they believe to be an impending nuclear attack, stunned 
neighbors and kept law enforcement officials busy Thursday night and Friday 
morning when they disappeared into about 45 newly constructed underground bomb 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Church members, who believe a nuclear strike from the Soviet Union could occur 
between now and the end of April, flocked into the shelters Thursday night from 
nearby Bozeman, Livingston, Gardiner, Corwin Springs and the member-owned 
community of Glastonbury, after they got telephone calls from church leaders 
asking them to go underground within three hours, church officials and 
sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
In cars, buses and trucks, the church members, who make up about a third of the 
12,000 residents of Park County, streamed down Highway 89 to a main shelter 
that holds 750 members of the church's inner circle and to an estimated 44 
other individually owned shelters, each of which holds from 6 to 125 people. 
They were in the shelters by midnight and remained there until Friday morning, 
officials said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
"The highway was filled with cars going into church property," said Park County 
Undersheriff Lee Keto. "By 20 minutes after twelve, you could have shot a 
cannon through there and not hit anything." 
</P>
<P>
The exercise was the latest in a series of incidents that have fueled rumors 
and fears among local residents and relatives of church members that the 
organization is preparing to go underground indefinitely. Church members have 
been stocking the shelters, closing bank accounts, selling off their personal 
belongings and buying large quantities of clothing, bedding and medication. 
</P>
<P>
Church leaders, however, have said they are preparing for an event they hope 
never occurs and that members will go underground only if there is a nuclear 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
Church spokesperson Murray Steinman said Thursday night's exercise was a only a 
surprise, practice run. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal was to see whether or not we could get everybody into the shelters by 
midnight," Steinman said. "We didn't announce it because by having a surprise 
drill we approximate realistic conditions. You have to work out the logistics 
in practice. Everybody was back at work in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Local officials have been concerned that the church members are planning to 
occupy the shelters without proper waste water treatment and sewage systems, 
threatening to contaminate the environmentally sensitive area and possibly 
prompting an outbreak of disease among residents, livestock and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Anderson, director of the Environmental Health Department, checked several 
shelters this week, including the main shelter, a massive facility located in 
the Gallatin Mountain Range just outside of Yellowstone National Park, and 
reported that none had proper waste treatment equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"There are articles that say in he event of nuclear disaster, they will occupy 
their shelters and let the waste spill on the ground," Anderson said of church 
literature. "If a bomb goes off, I don't care what they do with their sewage. 
But as far as some calamity in terms of Mother Nature, or an economic 
catastrophe, the rest of us are going to be concerned with what they do." 
</P>
<P>
By spending the night in the facilities with no waste water treatment, church 
members violated county codes, Anderson said. He said if they repeat the 
exercise, the county will pursue legal action. 
</P>
<P>
In response to admonitions from Elizabeth Claire Prophet of a possible nuclear 
war, nearly 2,000 church members from all over the country have been flooding 
into Paradise Valley to join the 2,000 church members who are already 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Prophet, known as Ma Guru to her followers, claims to be the reincarnation of 
Marie Antoinette and Queen Guinevere and to talk directly with "Ascended 
Masters," which include Jesus, St. Germaine and her deceased husband, Mark 
Prophet. She has warned members that March and April are a dangerous period and 
that members should liquidate their holdings and prepare for a possible nuclear 
assault.

U.S. LISTS CHIMPS AS ENDANGERED SPECIES

The government has declared wild chimpanzees an endangered species, a move that 
will provide additional federal protection for man's closest relative, 
officials confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had classified the primate as a "threatened" 
species, but officials said that more protection was needed in view of recent 
studies documenting a drastic decline in the populations of wild chimps in 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The endangered status designation was also extended to the pygmy chimpanzee, 
which, despite its name, is about the same size as the chimpanzee. 
</P>
<P>
The chimpanzee has disappeared from five of the 25 African countries that 
represent its historic range, and its population has fallen from a high of 
about 2 million to a current estimate of 175,000 because of overhunting and 
loss of habitat to man. 
</P>
<P>
The pygmy chimpanzee lives only in Zaire, and experts estimate its population 
at 15,000.

SOUTHEAST SOAKED BY SEVERE STORMS

<TEXT>
<P>
Thunderstorms and at least one tornado raked the Southeast on Friday as 
unseasonable heat lingered in the East, but blowing and drifting snow reminded 
residents of the upper Midwest and Plains that winter has not bowed out yet. 
</P>
<P>
Storms in the western Florida Panhandle unleashed up to 6 inches of rain in 
four hours and flooded a portion of Interstate 10 near Alabama up to car-bumper 
depth. 
</P>
<P>
A tornado uprooted trees northwest of Pensacola, Fla., while high winds 
sweeping northern Pensacola damaged an apartment complex. Dozens of roads and 
streets in the area were closed or flooded. 
</P>
<P>
Flooded-out roads also were reported in northwestern Georgia, the National 
Weather Service said. Mobile, Ala., was hit with nearly 11 inches of rain 
between noon Thursday and mid-Friday, while Montgomery, Ala., recorded 8 1/2 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
High winds made for hazardous driving in northeastern North Dakota and 
west-central and northwestern Minnesota, stirring up the 8 to 12 inches of 
snow. Gusts to 62 m.p.h. blew through Nebraska and South Dakota, and several 
highways in southeastern Wyoming were closed because of drifting snow.

IMELDA MARCOS LAUNCHES HER DEFENSE -- ALONGSIDE THE SPECTER OF A DEAD DICTATOR; 
</P>
<P>
CONSPIRACY CASE: JURY SELECTION STARTS NEXT WEEK. LATE HUSBAND OF THE FORMER 
PHILIPPINE FIRST LADY IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A KEY INFLUENCE ON THE TRIAL.

<P>
Imelda Marcos, dressed in mourning black and clutching Rosary beads, launched 
her defense against fraud and racketeering charges Friday alongside 
international financier Adnan Khashoggi and the ghost of her late husband, 
exiled Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom of U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan was packed with press and 
spectators trying to see the woman known in her homeland as "the Iron 
Butterfly" and the Saudi Arabian businessman and arms dealer once regarded as 
"the world's richest man." 
</P>
<P>
But it was the specter of a dead dictator that promised to have the greatest 
influence on the trial that opens with jury selection next week. Central to the 
case of chief federal prosecutor Charles LaBella is an alleged criminal 
conspiracy in which the deposed President, in life, played the key role. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be on trial. He's the heart of the government's case," said a lawyer, 
and former federal prosecutor, familiar with the case. 
</P>
<P>
And defense attorneys, reluctant to discuss trial strategies, nonetheless 
acknowledge that the ghost of Ferdinand Marcos poses a significant legal 
problem to his accused widow. 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Spence, Mrs. Marcos' flamboyant Wyoming attorney, said that in addition 
to defending the former First Lady, he will fight to clear the name of the dead 
President -- apparently setting aside any plan to assert what some call "the 
ignorant, innocent wife" defense. 
</P>
<P>
"She wants her husband defended in life or in death," Spence said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Marcos, 60, is charged with conspiring with her late husband to loot the 
Philippine national treasury of more than $100 million and using it to secretly 
purchase New York real estate. Among the choice properties were the Crown 
Building on 5th Avenue and a Wall Street skyscraper. 
</P>
<P>
They also were accused of fraudulently borrowing $165 million from American 
banks, including Security Pacific National Bank, to refinance the buildings and 
make additional purchases. 
</P>
<P>
The 90-page federal indictment outlines a plot involving embezzlement, bribes, 
kickbacks and forged documents starting about September, 1972, when Marcos 
seized dictatorial control of the Philippine government and continuing beyond 
February, 1986, when the couple were forced into exile by a popular revolt. 
</P>
<P>
According to the government, Khashoggi acted as a front for the Marcoses, 
helping to conceal the Marcoses' true ownership of New York properties with 
allegedly forged and back-dated legal documents and false claims that he owned 
the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi also is accused of trying to sell art for the Marcoses that allegedly 
belonged to the Philippine national museum. Millions of dollars in fine art in 
Khashoggi's possession was seized by French authorities and turned over to U.S. 
prosecutors nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, the defense teams suffered a setback when an attorney for Los 
Angeles-based California Overseas Bank, the sole corporate defendant in the 
case, entered a guilty plea to wire fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Smaltz, the lawyer for the bank, told the court that fictitious accounts 
were set up in the bank from 1977 to 1986 to funnel money from the Philippines, 
an admission that could undermine the Marcos defense. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Keenan indicated that the bank could face a possible fine of $500,000 at 
sentencing on April 23. 
</P>
<P>
The bank, which prosecutors charge was secretly owned by Marcos, was 
established by Roberto Benedicto, one of Marcos' closest friends and business 
cronies. He was chairman of the bank when federal grand jury indictments were 
issued in 1988, but he fled U.S. jurisdiction before he could be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Benedicto remains a fugitive, along with several other Marcos and Khashoggi 
associates. Earlier this month, Rodolfo T. Arambulo, former president of the 
bank, pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Attorney Smaltz 
said the bank's current management was not involved in the illegal 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's pretrial hearing dealt with jury selection procedures and exchanges of 
evidence. During the hearing, Spence complained that the Marcoses have received 
so much unfavorable publicity that his client already "has been tried and 
convicted in the press." 
</P>
<P>
In the phone interview, Spence questioned the U.S. government's right to 
prosecute former heads of state and condemned what he called "a sort of 
underlying hunger -- a sort of drool -- to do in another big and powerful 
person." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Marcos, appearing nervous and upset as Spence argued that she may not be 
able to get a fair and impartial jury, frequently dabbed her face with a 
tissue. Her son, Ferdinand (Bongbong) Jr., sat nearby. 
</P>
<P>
It was Mrs. Marcos' first court appearance with Khashoggi, who wore a blue suit 
and the electronic surveillance bracelet that was required as a condition of 
his $10-million bail. She has been free on $5-million bail.

ALHAMBRA POLICE STATION IS DAMAGED AS MAN IGNITES, TOSSES GASOLINE CAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Alhambra police station sustained smoke and fire damage Friday when a man 
threw a lit can of gasoline into the building, authorities said. No serious 
injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
William Klein, 35, of Alhambra, drove up to the station on Woodward Avenue 
about 9:30 p.m. and tossed a gallon can into the lobby, filling the building 
with smoke, said Alhambra Police Lt. Gene Shepherd. Officials said the 
carpeting in the lobby was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
A desk officer ran through flames in the lobby and apprehended Klein before he 
could escape in his truck, Shepherd said. Klein has had previous contact with 
Alhambra police, the lieutenant said. Authorities said they did not know of a 
motive for the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Several police civilian employees suffered smoke inhalation and were taken to a 
nearby hospital, Shepherd said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Rawson, an officer at the Monterey Park jail, said he was notified about 10 
p.m. by Alhambra officials that "they were having some problems in their jail, 
a lot of smoke and that they would be transporting a few of their prisoners to 
Monterey Park." 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Alhambra said misdemeanor prisoners were released and three felony 
prisoners were taken to Monterey Park.

LOWER AIDS PREDICTION FUELS DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The suggestion by two researchers that the AIDS epidemic has "crested" and will 
result in little more than 200,000 U.S. cases has reanimated the debate over 
the future course of one of the country's most pressing public health problems. 
</P>
<P>
The two former government epidemiologists have resurrected a 150-year-old 
epidemiological theory that states that epidemics follow the pattern of a 
bell-shaped curve. By that theory, called Farr's law, they say the AIDS 
epidemic has been on the wane since late 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But a host of other scientists say the theory may create false hope and ignores 
the peculiar complexity of the AIDS epidemic. With 1 million Americans believed 
infected with the AIDS virus, critics say the estimate of 200,000 cases will 
fall seriously short. 
</P>
<P>
The debate, aired Friday in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., involves 
sometimes inscrutable epidemiologic arcana. But the outcome could be 
significant in the power of projections to influence funding for AIDS research, 
treatment and education. 
</P>
<P>
"The risk, of course, is that those who don't understand the nature of AIDS and 
HIV, or those who for a long time have been wishing it will just go away . . . 
may prematurely declare victory," said Dr. James W. Curran of the U.S. Centers 
for Disease Control. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's, of course, not called for," said Curran, the author of an 
editorial challenging the applicability of Farr's law to AIDS. "But 
unfortunately, AIDS will get the best of these theories. We won't have to wait 
long to find out they're wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The Farr's law theory is being aired by Dennis J. Bregman, a former CDC 
official who is now an assistant professor of preventive medicine at USC, and 
Dr. Alexander Langmuir, who retired in the 1970s as chief of epidemiology for 
the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
Bregman and Langmuir base their projection on an 1840 law developed by 
pioneering epidemiologist William Farr. Farr fashioned the law after a smallpox 
epidemic in England and Wales, and refined it 25 years later after a severe 
outbreak of cattle plague. 
</P>
<P>
Using reported cases of AIDS in the United States through 1987, and applying 
Farr's principles, Bregman and Langmuir conclude by extrapolation that the AIDS 
epidemic peaked in late 1988 and the number of new cases being reported will 
bottom out in the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"If our projection is right, we're saying the epidemic might be only 25% of the 
size of what's been projected," Bregman said. "No one is even willing to 
consider the possibility that this epidemic is cresting and starting to 
decline." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Bregman and Langmuir's approach is being challenged by other 
epidemiologists and biostatisticians with their own prognostications -- based, 
for the most part, on more complex techniques that have been developed only in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
In an editorial accompanying Bregman and Langmuir's article, Curran and two 
other CDC officials contend that Farr's law applies only to simpler epidemics 
-- outbreaks in which the new infection is spread at a constant rate and among 
a well-defined group of people at risk. 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS epidemic, by contrast, involves several different populations, 
different routes of transmission, geographical variations and a long and 
variable time in which the infection remains latent in the body before 
producing symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
A separate research paper published in the same issue of the journal attempts 
to project the course of the AIDS epidemic in San Francisco. It takes into 
account such things as rates of infection and incubation, and the estimated 
number of people at risk. 
</P>
<P>
The model projects that there will have been 12,349 to 17,022 AIDS cases in San 
Francisco by June, 1993. The study makes no national projection, but one of its 
authors said he and others have estimated 350,000 to 400,000 cases throughout 
the country by the end of 1993.

PHYSICISTS CATCH A PARADOX IN A JAR;

SCIENCE: REAFFIRMING A THEORY NAMED FOR THE PHILOSOPHER ZENO, RESEARCHERS 
DEMONSTRATE, IN EFFECT, THAT A WATCHED POT DOESN'T BOIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Government researchers have for the first time proved a scientific principle 
that, in the arcane and often bizarre world of quantum physics, is equivalent 
to demonstrating that a watched pot never boils. 
</P>
<P>
In proving what is known as the quantum Zeno effect, named after the Greek 
philosopher, the physicists at the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology in Boulder, Colo., reaffirmed the now well-known paradigm that 
attempting to measure the characteristics of atoms at the submicroscopic level 
can alter the characteristics that are being measured. 
</P>
<P>
One particularly intriguing aspect of that principle -- and one that still 
remains to be proved -- is that continuous observation of unstable radioactive 
isotopes can prevent them from disintegrating radioactively. Theoretically, by 
the tenets of the Zeno effect, if a nuclear bomb were watched intently enough, 
it could not explode. 
</P>
<P>
The new research, which is to be published in the journal Physical Review A, 
has no immediate practical applications, said physicist Wayne M. Itano of NIST, 
but it does indicate that there are fundamental limits to the accuracy that can 
be achieved with atomic clocks. 
</P>
<P>
It is "a fantastic result," said physicist Peter Coveney of the University of 
Wales in Bangor, United Kingdom. "It seems that the act of looking at an atom 
prevents it from changing. It is completely against what common sense would 
tell us, and implies that quantum mechanics does not . . . operate at the scale 
of real kettles." 
</P>
<P>
Zeno of Elea, who lived from 490 to 430 BC, was one of the first proponents of 
the rhetorical technique of reductio ad absurdum, in which he would derive 
impossible conclusions from the opinions of his philosophical opponents. He is 
best known for four apparent paradoxes that have been adequately explained only 
in this century through sophisticated applications of the concepts of space and 
time. 
</P>
<P>
One of his most famous paradoxes involves a flying arrow. Because an object 
cannot occupy two places at the same time, he argued, the arrow is at only one 
place at any given moment during its flight. But to be in one place is to be at 
rest. Therefore, the arrow is at rest during every moment of its flight, he 
concluded, and motion is impossible. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, theoretical physicist Ennackel Sudershan and his colleagues at 
the University of Texas in Austin showed in theory that "a continuously 
observed quantum state cannot decay" -- that is, an atom in one energy state 
cannot change its energy as long as it is being observed. Sudershan dubbed this 
phenomenon the quantum Zeno effect, but until the recent NIST experiments, no 
one had demonstrated it directly. 
</P>
<P>
Itano and his colleagues undertook the experiment, he said, "because we had 
some apparatus we were using to make a better atomic clock that could easily be 
modified" to do the research. 
</P>
<P>
In their experiment, the "kettle" was a magnetic field that was used to hold 
the "water," a cluster of about 5,000 positively charged beryllium ions, in a 
fixed position. The "heat" they applied to the kettle was a radiofrequency 
field that would drive the beryllium ions from a low initial energy state to a 
higher energy state. 
</P>
<P>
By shining a brief pulse of light from a laser on the beryllium atoms, they 
could readily determine which state the atoms were in. 
</P>
<P>
The transition from the low- to the high-energy state takes about 250 
milliseconds, or one-quarter of a second. If the researchers turn on the 
radiofrequency field and then check the atoms with the laser about 250 
milliseconds later, virtually all will be in the high-energy state. 
</P>
<P>
But if the researchers check the atoms only 4 milliseconds after the 
radiofrequency field is turned on, they find that virtually all are still in 
the low-energy state. But more important, the process of measuring their energy 
state gives "a little nudge" to those atoms that had started a trek to the 
higher energy state, forcing them back down to the lower state -- in effect, 
resetting the system to zero. 
</P>
<P>
As long as the researchers keep checking the atoms every 4 milliseconds, the 
atoms never make it to the higher energy state, despite the outside force 
driving them toward it. As long as the observers are watching them, in other 
words, they never boil. 
</P>
<P>
The same principle should apply to the radioactive disintegration of atoms, 
Itano said, but he added that it does not "look feasible" to test it now. The 
disintegration of an atom occurs in a time interval roughly a million billion 
times shorter than the energy change in beryllium atoms, he said, and 
physicists simply cannot measure it fast enough to prevent it from occurring.

1,000 GATHER AT BORDER, PROTEST CROSSINGS; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION: THEY ILLUMINATE AREA WITH VEHICLE HEADLIGHTS TO SHOW ANGER AT FLOW 
OF ILLEGAL ALIENS INTO THE U.S.

<P>
More than 1,000 people gathered along the U.S.-Mexico border Friday and jointly 
turned on their vehicle headlights at dusk to show their dissatisfaction with 
the continued flow of illegal immigrants from Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
It was the largest turnout to date in the protest, organized by a loose 
coalition of area residents who want to dramatize what they consider a lack of 
control along the notoriously porous international boundary. Some have 
criticized the group as racist, a charge dismissed by protest organizers. 
</P>
<P>
There were several heated discussions between the protesters and others who 
took a more sympathetic view of illegal immigration, but no violence was 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters showed up in more than 400 vehicles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want the place lit up, and with that will come proper attention and 
proper law enforcement," said Muriel Watson, a San Diego County resident who is 
the widow of a longtime Border Patrol officer. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "Light Up the Border" activists, all of whom appeared Friday to 
be non-Latino, advocate an agenda that is mostly at odds with the stance of 
pro-immigrant groups, many of which have large Latino representation. The 
protesters are seeking, among other things, increased U.S. border enforcement, 
construction of additional fencing and other barriers. 
</P>
<P>
The growing strength of the lighting activists -- the movement only started 
last November -- underscores the increasing polarity of views along the 
U.S.-Mexican border, where the flow of undocumented migrants has long been a 
controversial issue. 
</P>
<P>
"This is pure racism," said Juan Gonzalez, a 44-year-old Mexican laborer and 
resident of the border neighborhood of San Ysidro who happened to be driving by 
as the protesters gathered. In response, he played loud Mexican music on his 
car radio. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters reject charges of racism. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a racist movement by any stretch of the imagination," said Audrey 
Bergner, a La Jolla resident, who handed out a press release placing 
undocumented persons in four categories: one sympathetic grouping -- "poor 
people looking for a better way of life" and three less complimentary ones -- 
criminals, drug smugglers and terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
She, like others, blamed undocumented people for a wide array of problems, from 
crime to the spread of disease to what she views as the downfall of the public 
education system. Critics dispute the connection between those problems and 
illegal immigration. She also expressed the opinion that the undocumented take 
jobs from legal U.S. residents. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's event was the fifth time that the activists had turned their 
headlights toward Tijuana, aiming their beams at groups of prospective 
border-crossers, many of them women and children, who nightly attempt to enter 
the United States without documents.

BAKERY NOW MEETS STATE HEALTH CODE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After a rare conviction for violating state health laws, the LA Central Bakery 
in Oxnard was found to be in compliance after an inspection was conducted this 
week, according to a prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Charges were brought against the firm at 600 Meta St. after investigations in 
August and November by the state Department of Health Services revealed that 
the bakery was unsanitary, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
The bakery was also selling tortillas and other foods that did not meet legal 
standards of purity and processing, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
The bakery and its chief executive officer, Frank Rodriguez, pleaded no contest 
to misdemeanor violations and were sentenced last month to three years 
probation. A summary probation does not require reporting to a probation 
officer. They were also ordered to pay a fine of $500 each. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said while he suspected many establishments were in violation of the 
Health and Safety Code, the conviction was "a little unusual." 
</P>
<P>
The bakery had been given two warnings before charges were filed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Photographs taken by health inspectors showed that the ceiling was 
deteriorating in some places, the kitchen floors were dirty and parts of the 
refrigerator were rusting, he said. PEGGY LEE

AIR BILL WOULD RAISE AUTO LICENSE COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Motorists in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties would pay an additional $2 to 
$4 a year in vehicle registration fees if new legislation to help reduce air 
pollution becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara), would add up to $2 
million annually to the $2.5-million budget of the Ventura County Air Pollution 
Control District, District Planning Director William Mount said. 
</P>
<P>
The air district would use the money to buy vehicle fleets that run on clean 
fuel such as methanol, provide seed money for private industry clean-fuel 
programs, study how cars are used in the county and improve mass transit, Mount 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Demonstrating new technology is very expensive," Mount said. "It would be 
extremely difficult without the new funding." 
</P>
<P>
Hart's bill, which has the endorsement of Ventura County supervisors, goes 
before the Senate Resources Committee in Sacramento on April 3. The bill is 
believed to have good chances of passing because it affects only Ventura and 
Santa Barbara counties, said Drew Liebert, legislative consultant to Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed a similar bill last year that would have raised 
funds for all counties in the state. Deukmejian supported the concept of paying 
for air pollution programs with registration fees, Liebert said, but rejected 
the bill because of a dispute among planning agencies in Los Angeles County 
over who should control the money. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a complete consensus in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties on how the 
money should be spent," Liebert said. JOANNA MILLER

MOORPARK MAN TO RUN FOR STATE BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moorpark resident Tom Baldwin will enter the June Democratic primary for a seat 
on the State Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
The only candidate from Ventura County, Baldwin will compete against five 
candidates from Northern and Southern California for the Democratic nomination 
for the 2nd District seat, which represents Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis 
Obispo counties, as well as parts of Los Angeles County and counties in Central 
and Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The position is an important one, Baldwin said, because the board is comprised 
of only five members who administer more than half the state's tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the utmost importance is the fact that there is currently a drive on in the 
courts to have Proposition 13 declared unconstitutional," Baldwin said. "It is 
important that we have a board that is sympathetic to homeowners because there 
is a good chance it could be overturned." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13, passed in 1978, froze state property taxes at 1% of their 1975 
assessed value and capped annual increases at 2% of assessed value. It is 
largely blamed for the current fiscal crises faced by many of the state's 58 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin, 43, has been a Moorpark resident for 12 years. He is serving his third 
year as a trustee on the Moorpark Unified School District and has served three 
years on the city's Parks and Recreation District board. 
</P>
<P>
He is employed as a technician in the defense industry by a Woodland Hills 
contractor. JOANNA MILLER

<TEXT>
<P>
Artists, writers, actors and musicians still have an opportunity to be listed 
in the first city of Ojai Arts Roster. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline for free listings has been extended to March 22. 
</P>
<P>
More than 180 listings have been received, said Bert Collins of Ojai, a member 
of the city's Arts Advisory Committee. Committee members are compiling the free 
directory for distribution later this spring at City Hall, the Ojai Valley 
Chamber of Commerce, public libraries and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
There is no charge to artists to list a brief statement describing their 
medium, name and phone number. Addresses are optional, since the information 
will be made public. 
</P>
<P>
Committee member Bert Collins, an award-winning acrylic realist, will be 
accepting listings through next Thursday, the committee's next meeting, at Ojai 
City Hall, 401 S. Ventura St. It will begin at 6:30 p.m. Listings may also be 
given by phone at 646-6907. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the city will select recipients of arts grants. Six applicants 
have applied for the $1,700 the city has budgeted for grants this year. 
</P>
<P>
Among programs seeking grants are art classes and the annual Ojai Music 
Festival, June 1-3, at Libbey Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Other items on the panel's agenda are a proposal for funding from the Ventura 
County Art Alliance and the selection of artists for the Art in Public Places 
program. Under this program, paintings are selected for display in City Council 
chambers for six-week periods. THIA BELL

PRESCHOOL SLOTS HARD TO COME BY

<P>
At 9 a.m. Friday, Renee Staben ended a 16-hour camp-out. 
</P>
<P>
She had waited overnight, with other Camarillo residents trickling into the 
line behind her, bringing their portable lawn chairs and blankets. 
</P>
<P>
It was not a welfare line or a line for concert tickets or even a line to buy a 
new home. Yet Staben and many of the 20 or more parents felt they had to line 
up the morning before the United Methodist Church Nursery School in Camarillo 
opened enrollment for summer or fall programs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really terrible," said Staben, who was trying to enroll her 1-year-old 
son and her young daughter. "Camarillo does not have enough preschools. Every 
school I went to told me they were filled." 
</P>
<P>
"I do this just for my kids," said Ron Mulhern, an airline pilot, who got in 
line at 8 p.m. Thursday to sign up his 3-year-old daughter. "There's nothing 
else in the world worth this." 
</P>
<P>
Ida Ambrose, director of the nursery school, said lines are not uncommon 
outside the church school. Church members have priority for school openings. 
Thirty-one children were enrolled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard," said Ambrose, who has changed the registration times in the past 
to try to accommodate parents' work schedules. "We don't have the space to put 
in more programs." 
</P>
<P>
To many of the parents, the issue is quality, not work schedules or space. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been told it's a good program," Staben said. "I don't want a day-care 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a repeat customer," said Tom York, who arrived about midnight. York said 
that his 5-year-old daughter's experiences in the church's preschool have 
allowed her to succeed in kindergarten and that he hopes his 2-year-old son 
will do the same. 
</P>

Childhood Programs. JEFF SCHNAUFER

SHUTTLE CANCELS BAY AREA FLIGHTS FOR A MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 800 would-be air passengers were surprised to learn Friday that their 
reservations on a shuttle flight from Oxnard to the Bay Area had been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
California Air Shuttle had to cancel flights for the next 30 days because the 
engine on one of the company's two 19-seat aircraft cannot be overhauled, said 
Steve Lay, shuttle airline president. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the process of canceling 800 reservations" out of 1,300 for the next 
month, Lay said. "It's not been a good day." 
</P>
<P>
Lay said his company is expecting delivery of four new $3.4-million planes 
within the next month and will resume service to the Bay Area after that. 
</P>
<P>
Some passengers were reaccommodated on other airlines Friday, while others were 
told that they would be refunded the amount of their tickets, Lay said. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Bowen, a 43-year-old Oxnard resident, said he had been planning a visit 
at the end of the month to San Francisco to see his new grandson. He said that, 
although he will be reimbursed, he will probably have to pay $60 to $80 more 
for a ticket on another airline. 
</P>
<P>
The plane cannot be serviced because Fairchild Aircraft Co., a San 
Antonio-based firm, recently went bankrupt, making it impossible for the small 
Oxnard airline to obtain parts to service the engine, Lay said. 
</P>
<P>
So, beginning Monday, the airline will not be able to operate four daily 
flights to San Jose, Lay said. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers on three weekend flights to San Jose are unaffected, Lay said, and 
the shuttle service will still operate two daily and three weekend flights to 
Las Vegas.

PADRES: JACK CLARK, BRUCE HURST AND TONY GWYNN SAY THEY WILL SEEK FREE AGENCY 
IF THE TEAM CARRIES OUT ITS PROMISE TO DOCK THEIR PAY.

Jack Clark, Bruce Hurst and Tony Gwynn said Friday that they will file a 
grievance in an attempt to gain free agency should the Padres carry out their 
promise to dock their pay because of a shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, on the advice of the Player Relations Committee, have informed four 
players -- Clark, Hurst, Gwynn and Eric Show -- that they will not receive full 
pay if the baseball lockout results in cancelled games. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, according to the Major League Players Assn., are required to pay 
the four players their full salaries during the lockout. Yet, the players 
received notices with their March 15 paycheck that they should expect 
deductions for a shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
"I guarantee you if any of my checks are missing so much as a dime," Clark 
said, "they won't see me again. The next time they'll see me again will be in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"If (the major league owners) think there will be a whole new ballgame now, 
just wait. I'll show you a whole new game when we're in court. I'm tired of 
their damn games. This is another one of their ploys. It's one of their scare 
tactics." 
</P>
<P>
Clark realizes that the PRC is behind the Padres' action, and vents his anger 
not only at the team's management, but all of baseball's owners. Yet, if the 
Padres continue their threat of withholding wages, he promises they'll be the 
ones paying the price. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I taking this seriously?," Clark said. "You're damn right I am. If they 
pull this crap on us, they're going to lose me, they're going to lose Hurst and 
they're going to lose Tony. They're screwing with the wrong guys. We'll all 
file for free agency and split. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad. It's ugly. No matter what happens, these scars aren't going to go 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"The owners keep telling us to trust them, yeah, right, as gutless and 
untrustworthy as they are." 
</P>
<P>
Hurst, who became a free agent after the 1988 season with the Boston Red Sox, 
signed a three-year, $5.25 million guaranteed contract with the Padres that 
specifically provided that he be paid during a baseball lockout. In fact, if 
the Padres had not provided the clause in the contract, Hurst said that he's 
not sure he would have come to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"They know what they signed, and I know what I signed," Hurst said. "No one got 
hood-winked in this deal. The deal is if there was a lockout, I would get paid. 
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, all of a sudden, they say they're not going to pay me. I'm not a whiz 
kid, but I perceive that as breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't get paid, we'll file a grievance, and I'll sure take my chance at 
free agency." 
</P>
<P>
Show and his agent, Arn Tellem, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The four Padre players learned of their predicament when written notices were 
included with their March 15 paychecks that advised them of possible future 
deductions. Hurst, Gwynn and Show are paid on a 12-month schedule. Clark gets 
paid from March 15 to November 15. 
</P>
<P>
The notices that were mailed to the players, according to sources, read: 
"Please be advised should the current disruption cause a delay in the start of 
the championship season, future salary deductions will be made based on the 
days of the championship season missed and not the actual payment schedule in 
your contract. Therefore, it may be necessary to withhold payment of salary 
after the resumption of play so that the club has fully received any 
overpayment which resulted due to your payment schedule." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that most of the major league players with guaranteed contracts won't 
be paid is no secret, considering that 199 players with guaranteed contracts 
have lockout language in their contracts which relieves the club's obligation 
for payment. 
</P>
<P>
But yet, according to sources in the Major League Players Assn. and the Player 
Relations Committee, 31 players have clauses in their contract that provide for 
payment in the event of a lockout and 16 players have no lockout language at 
all. Hurst and Show each have defensive language that provides for payment and 
Clark and Gwynn have no language in their contracts that would preclude 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
So why the notices to the four players? 
</P>
<P>
"There's all kinds of different language in contracts," said Louis Melendez, 
associate counsel of the Player Relations Committee, "but it's the 
understanding that everyone under a standard uniform players' contract will not 
be paid (during a lockout). 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure many of these cases will be litigated and challenged, but if there 
are games missed, the appropriate deductions will be made." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Beck, the Padre assistant to vice president/baseball operations who sent 
out the notifications, said: "This is a mandate from the PRC. Hopefully, this 
will become a moot point, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Still, even if a labor agreement preserving the 162-game season is reached 
today between the players and owners, Clark said that the memories of this 
lockout will not fade. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who joined the Padres in October, 1988, became the first big-name free 
agent to break the collusion barrier in 1988 when he left the St. Louis 
Cardinals and signed with the New York Yankees. He signed a three-year, 
$6-million contract with the Yankees that contained no lockout language. When 
he was traded, the Padres picked up his contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to scratch and claw for what I got," Clark said, "and now they're trying 
to tell me it's no good. I had to go to nuclear war to get a contract like 
that, and they're trying to take it away. This is a lot of crap and I'm getting 
tired of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm directly involved in all three collusion cases. I haven't had my day in 
court yet, but I will. I'm ready to open up all the smut in court. I'm still 
gathering evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the hell these owners are thinking of. The owners don't give 
a damn about anything except for their greed. It's getting real old, I'm 
telling you." 
</P>
<P>
The Players Assn. has been informed of the notices mailed to the Padres and 
other teams, and said that it will wait until any pay deductions materialize 
before a grievance is filed. Once a grievance has been filed, the major league 
club has 10 days to cover the lost wages, according to an official with the 
Players Assn. If the player is not compensated, the spokesman said, the player 
may file for free agency. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to open a whole new can of worms," said the official, who spoke 
only on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The four Padre players who received the notices are among the eight 
highest-paid players on the team and have guaranteed contracts that are 
scheduled to pay them $5.3 million -- about one-third of the club's 1990 player 
payroll. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, according to sources in the Players Assn. and the PRC, are 
scheduled to pay nearly $17.5 million in salaries and signing bonuses to major 
league players on their 24-man roster this season. The average salary will be 
$728,000. 
</P>
<P>
There are a franchise-record seven players who will make at least $1 million 
this season, led by outfielder Joe Carter who already received a $2 million 
signing bonus and has a $1.2 million contract. Other signing bonuses in the 
1990 fiscal year are $500,000 to free-agent reliever Craig Lefferts and 
$150,000 to free-agent outfielder Fred Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
While Clark, Hurst, Gwynn and Show are the only players on the Padres with 
favorable or no lockout language in their contracts, a shortened season is 
expected to have even a more severe effect on players with incentive-laden 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn has the most playing incentives of anyone on the Padres and would nearly 
double his base salary of $500,000 if he achieves the incentives and bonuses. 
His contract requires that he be paid $3,000 for every game he plays past his 
80th, and $5,000 a game for every game beginning with his 100th. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely not going to be fair if games are canceled," Lynn said. "I'm 
going to look into pro-rating the incentives with the schedule. I think that's 
only fair, but I'm certain they'll have a different point of view." 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Mike Pagliarulo also has provisions that would pay him an extra 
$95,000 to his base $575,000 contract if he should play a full season and make 
625 plate-appearances. And shortstop Garry Templeton would add $40,000 to his 
base $500,000 contract if he plays in 140 games. 
</P>
<P>
Show, who structured his contract so that he would receive $400,000 less this 
season than in 1989 because of a possible strike, could be adversely affected 
even a year from now by a shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
Show's contract stipulates that his 1991 season would become vested if he 
pitches 175 innings in either 1989 or 1990. Since he underwent back surgery and 
missed half of the 1989 season, he would have to meet the requirement this year 
or wait for the Padres' decision. If the option is picked up, Show is eligible 
to file for an arbitration award of $1.1 million to $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Honesty has certainly shown it doesn't always work, does it?" said Nick 
Lampros, Hurst's agent. "You've got to wonder how serious the owners are about 
settling this."

THE MAGIC IS BACK FOR SOCKERS; 
</P>
<P>
MISL: COACH RON NEWMAN WAS SMILING AFTER HIS TEAM ROUTED THE KANSAS CITY COMETS 
FRIDAY NIGHT, 7-1, FOR THE SOCKERS' THIRD VICTORY IN A ROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We haven't seen this look on Ron Newman's face for a long, long time. 
</P>
<P>
The coach of the Sockers walked off the field and into the locker room Friday 
night wearing the expression of a guy who has just completed his income tax 
form and discovered Uncle Sam owes him some change. His team had just stomped 
on the Kansas City Comets, 7-1, before 7,367 at the San Diego Sports Arena. The 
Sockers (18-21) have now won three in a row for the first time since November 
18th. And keep in mind, Kansas City (22-18) had won nine of 10 games before 
arriving in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"All right," said Newman, clenching his fist and waving it in the air for all 
to see. "That can't be a fluke can it? Maybe there is something there after 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting rewarded when we work hard. We've just got to keep it going." 
</P>
<P>
All of a sudden, the little things are going right. Newman sometimes calls it 
"kissing the Blarney stone," which is the Irish equivalent to "Hey man, you got 
lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the Sockers reaped the benefits of good fortune Friday, scoring 
their first two goals off deflections. Yet the nice bounces usually don't 
happen unless a team is light on its feet. In the past two games, the Sockers 
have found something they've been missing all season: enthusiasm and 
consistency. 
</P>
<P>
The spunk is hard to miss. Witness rookie defender Donald Cogsville leaping 
into the arms of his teammate, Cacho, after scoring the first goal of his 
career to put the Sockers ahead, 2-1, early in the second quarter. And Paul 
Wright flying off the bench in the third quarter to steal a Comet pass and give 
the Sockers possession. 
</P>
<P>
This is the stuff that wins championships. The stuff that makes players around 
the Major Indoor Soccer League start to wonder if this team has patched itself 
back together in time to keep their mystique for yet another season. 
</P>
<P>
"The team's a lot happier," said Branko Segota, who scored two goals to give 
him five in two games. "Everybody's trying to help each other out right now." 
</P>
<P>
Players who were less involved in the past are suddenly involved. Defender 
Kevin Crow missed Friday's game to attend his grandmother's funeral in the 
Fresno area. That snapped a streak of 87 games in a row for Crow. No matter. 
Forward Jim Gabarra switched back to defense, played solidly and even scored 
when goalie Jim Gorsek, a former Socker, let a shot through his legs in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Waad Hirmez received credit for the Sockers' first goal in the first 
quarter when a shot by defender George Fernandez bounced off his back and 
passed Gorsek. 
</P>
<P>
Comet midfielder Kevin Hundelt scored off a rebound pass from forward Ted Eck 
to make it 1-1. After Cogsville's goal, Branko Segota scored with his left foot 
from 25 feet to give the Sockers a 3-1 lead going into halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Everything was simple after that. The second half consisted of third quarter 
goals from Segota and midfielder Ben Collins and fourth-quarter goals from 
Cacho and then Gabarra. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important than the scoring outburst, was the tireless team 
defense, which allowed goalie Victor Nogueira (9-10) to pick up the victory 
with just nine saves. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing totally differently," Nogueira said. "I was very lucky. I hardly 
had any shots, which says a lot for the defense." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing spectacular, said Gorsek. Just sweat and effort. 
</P>
<P>
"They worked hard tonight," he said. "They weren't doing anything special. They 
were moving as a team all over the field." 
</P>
<P>
Younger players such as Cogsville, Thien Nguyen and Wes Wade are providing 
inspiration for the veterans. 
</P>
<P>
"The young guys have the heart," Fernandez said. "They've lifted the team. They 
want to get out there and they're hungry." 
</P>
<P>
And with that, the rest of the team is developing an appetite of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Paul Wright, moved from forward to midfielder since his return to San Diego in 
the Zoran Karic trade, doesn't seem to mind his new role. "That's what the plan 
was, to put Branko (Segota) up front and let him do what he does best," Wright 
said. "Let me do the hard work." Playing his first game at forward last 
Tuesday, Segota had three goals and two assists in the Sockers' 9-3 victory 
over St. Louis. . . . Midfielder Brian Quinn (tendinitis of the groin) missed 
his sixth consecutive game. Also out of uniform was veteran forward Steve 
Zungul, who has now missed four games in a row.

STRIKING TEACHERS VOW TO STAY OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court upheld a lower court's order that striking teachers in 
one county return to work, but it overrode another judge's attempt to issue a 
statewide back-to-work order. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers' union said the strike will continue. The walkout began March 7. 
Last Wednesday, about one-third of the state's nearly 22,000 teachers showed up 
for work, but all schools were closed for two days of cooling off. The state 
attorney general's office has declared the strike -- the first by West Virginia 
teachers -- illegal, and said teachers can be suspended, fired or charged with 
misdemeanors. The Legislature has approved a $27-million plan to improve 
teacher salaries.

SEQUESTERING OF JURY IN SPILL CASE REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A defense request to sequester the jury in the Anchorage trial of the captain 
of the Exxon Valdez to shield them from publicity of the approaching 
anniversary of the nation's worst oil spill was rejected by state Superior 
Court Judge Karl Johnstone. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnstone granted the defense what it called a "major victory" in ruling 
that Joseph Hazelwood could not be considered guilty of acting recklessly for 
attempting to dislodge the grounded tanker from Bligh Reef. The Exxon Valdez on 
March 24, 1989, spilled about 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William 
Sound, and Hazelwood is charged with reckless endangerment, operating the 
tanker while intoxicated, negligent discharge of oil and criminal mischief. 
Closing arguments are expected next week.

An eyewitness in the killing of a black teen-ager who decided at the last 
moment not to testify against his friends was charged with 2nd-degree murder in 
the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
John Vento, 21, was charged with intentional murder and showing a depraved 
indifference to human life in the August, 1989, slaying of Yusuf Hawkins in 
Brooklyn. Vento's decision forced a postponement in the trial, and it was seen 
as a major blow to the prosecution's efforts to build cases against the seven 
others charged. Hawkins and three others had gone to the predominantly white 
Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst to look at a used car when they were 
attacked by baseball-bat-wielding white youths.

CHAVEZ, TAYLOR TRY TO TOP THAT OTHER FIGHT OF YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Months ago, this bout was picked by nearly everyone in boxing as the fight of 
the year for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Buster Douglas' upset of Mike Tyson in Tokyo on Feb. 10, and that 
fight still has the boxing world somewhat stunned. At the Las Vegas Hilton this 
week, conversations drift quickly from tonight's long-awaited matchup of Julio 
Cesar Chavez and Meldrick Taylor to the most talked-about heavyweight fight in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Chavez and Taylor will proceed tonight at 140 pounds with probably the 
best matchup of fighters in the lighter weight classes since Aaron Pryor and 
Alexis Arguello staged two memorable battles in 1982 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Two champions, in their prime, and both undefeated. Well, an asterisk is 
required. The marquee has a 68-0 by Chavez's name, but he was disqualified in a 
1981 bout. Later, the referee's call was overturned. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, 27, has 55 knockouts and, even more impressive, is 16-0 in championship 
fights.He has been a champion in three weight classes and is currently the 
World Boxing Council's junior-welterweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 23, was a 17-year-old from Philadelphia when he won the 1984 Olympic 
gold medal as a featherweight. He is 24-0-1, the only blemish a draw in 1986 
with Howard Davis. Taylor, whose primary asset is great hand speed, has 14 
knockouts. He's 4-0 in championship fights since taking the International 
Boxing Federation junior-welterweight title from Buddy McGirt in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez has been a 2-1 favorite all week. Both Taylor and his trainer, Lou Duva, 
maintain that Taylor is in the best shape of his life, which they see as 
mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
"If Meldrick goes in there at 99% or 98%, he's in trouble -- that's how much we 
think of Chavez," Duva said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Taylor: "Chavez is very good under pressure, and he's very patient. He's 
the best guy I've ever fought, that's for sure. But he's the type of guy who 
can make me better. 
</P>
<P>
"I am motivated. I will adjust and adapt. He's going to try to counter (punch) 
me to the ropes. That's the only place where he's effective, when he's got you 
on the ropes. He'll even try to push me to the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very confident. To me, Chavez is not a legend. He's a guy who is going up 
against the toughest fighter he ever met. I'm ready to go 12 rounds to beat him 
if I have to. He's a great body puncher, but I'll see those shots coming. He 
sets himself a split-second before he throws the body shot. Most Mexican 
fighters do that." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor once was labeled an indifferent trainer. Early in his pro career, Duva 
caught him in his hotel room the night before a fight with a pizza. Even now, 
he figures to have a more difficult time making 140 than Chavez. "Except for a 
week Meldrick took off two months ago, he's trained 12 weeks for this fight," 
Duva said. "I can't imagine how this kid could have pushed his body any harder 
for this here fight." 
</P>
<P>
Since he won his first world championship at super-featherweight, in 1984, 
Chavez's forte has been superb conditioning. He's not a knockout puncher, but 
he is a nonstop puncher. Almost always, he is stronger in the late rounds than 
his opponents. He throws short, hard, crisp punches inside. His short left hook 
to the ribs is spoken of by trainers in awe. The typical finish to a Chavez 
fight has his opponent gripping his ribs, pain showing on his face. Rarely does 
an opponent finish on his back. 
</P>
<P>
Almost always, Chavez tries to maneuver his opponents to the ropes, there to 
unload short, sharp combinations on a foe who can't back up. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor has trained carefully to avoid that. Duva, before each sparring section, 
has made an inner ring in the ring, putting down four 12-foot long adhesive 
tape strips and ordering his fighter to stay inside the tape. 
</P>
<P>
Of Taylor's speed, Chavez gives you only a wink and a smile. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of ways to stop his speed," he says, through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez's people hope a convincing victory over Taylor will catapult Chavez into 
boxing's financial stratosphere. He is making $1.4 million for this fight, 
Taylor $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Some wonder why this little man's war isn't a pay-per-view fight, rather than 
an HBO telecast. The reason, promoters say, is that although Chavez is very 
popular in Mexico and the Latino neighborhoods of Southern California and the 
Southwestern United States, those areas tend not to be wired for cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked at pay per view, but we felt that HBO was paying us more ($2.5 
million) than we could generate with pay per view," said Dan Duva, Taylor's 
promoter. 
</P>
<P>
"People with more than a passing interest in boxing love this fight. But could 
you get $30 per household, across the country? We didn't think so. Chavez is a 
great fighter, but he's just not that well known in the East. When he fought in 
Atlantic City, they had to give tickets away."

KIMBLE HELPS LOYOLA SCORE SPECIAL WIN

<P>
Playing before a record crowd of 12,200 at Long Beach Arena, Loyola Marymount 
took the court Friday night for the first time since teammate Hank Gathers died 
March 4. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions wore round patches with "44" -- Gathers' uniform number -- on their 
jerseys and fans waved Hank Hankies. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions seemed to finally get their emotions under control in the second half 
and they surged past New Mexico State, 111-92, in the first round of the NCAA 
tournament. The Lions will play defending champion Michigan Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Kimble, Gathers' friend long before he became his Loyola teammate, seemed to 
be pressing in the first half and drew his fourth foul with 4:45 to play in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
When he drew the fourth foul, Kimble said, "I went through a brief meditation 
-- do not foul . . . do not foul." 
</P>
<P>
It worked. Kimble finished with a Western Regional record 45 points, 33 in the 
second half. He scored 35 points after drawing his fourth foul and added a 
career-high 18 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions pulled away from a 46-46 halftime tie as Kimble keyed a 28-6 run in 
the first six minutes of the second half. The lead grew to 84-56 on a 
three-pointer by Kimble and the Aggies never got closer than the final margin. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble also made good on a promise to shoot his first free throw left-handed to 
honor his friend. His chance finally came with 14:46 to play, and he swished 
the southpaw shot, then was mobbed by teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola outrebounded the Aggies, 51-35, and made 11 three-pointers, nine in the 
second half. The Lions also forced 24 Aggie turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"They went after the ball like a one-eyed dog in a butcher shop," New Mexico 
State Coach Neil McCarthy said of Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead said he wasn't worried about leaving Kimble in with four fouls. 
"That's my style," he said. McCarthy said: "I wasn't surprised. He's their main 
man. I've seen Paul do that before." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Fryer added 23 points for the Lions, making five three-pointers and adding 
six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Reggie Jordan led the Aggies with 22 points. Center James Anderson 
added 16. New Mexico State finished the season at 26-5. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore center Chris Knight, taking over the starting position for Gathers, 
scored the game's first basket as the Lions took an 11-1 lead. Knight finished 
with six points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State caught up midway through the first half, taking a 18-17 lead, 
and the teams played evenly to the half. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead made a shift in his trapping press after halftime, and the Lions 
pulled away, improving to 24-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions will play Michigan at 2 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"When we took the floor I sensed a community spirit," Westhead said. "It was a 
great feeling to have the community of Los Angeles supporting us."

MIKE DOWNEY: NCAA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
THE LIONS PLAYED TO THEIR STRENGTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Locker rooms are places where basketball players put on their game faces, much 
the same way actors apply lipstick and rouge. The locker room is where the late 
Hank Gathers used to strut around flexing and hailing himself as "the strongest 
man in the world," which was his way of donning his game face, a look of 
self-confidence supreme. 
</P>
<P>
Without him, the men of Loyola Marymount had a decision to make Friday night -- 
which game faces to wear. Like classical thespians, they had to choose between 
the mocking mask of comedy or the weeping mask of tragedy. Already their 
uniforms were embroidered with an encircled "44" in tribute to their fallen 
friend, and their sneakers bore felt-penned slogans similar to Terrell 
Lowery's, which read: "44-EVER." From the neck down, they were ready. 
</P>
<P>
And their faces? Well, inside a brightly lit locker room of Long Beach Arena, 
in the slowly ticking minutes before an NCAA tournament game against New Mexico 
State, it was obvious that Loyola's Lions had elected to lighten up, to leave 
their sorrows behind. Tragedy tomorrow, basketball tonight. 
</P>
<P>
There was more than a trace of a smile on Coach Paul Westhead's relaxed face, 
and pinned to a wall behind him was a good-luck greeting card signed and sent 
by the basketball team of Westhead's college alma mater, St. Joseph's of 
Philadelphia. His players did their level best to relax. Their tear ducts had 
dried up. They decided instead to come out happy and howling, doing a typically 
school-boyish cheer that referred to kicking the other team where it sat. 
</P>
<P>
And out the Lions came, to the reception of an audience waving Hank Hankies and 
handmade banners and pennants and jerseys and anything and everything that 
reminded them of the man who was missing. Loyola's players limbered up, shot 
some shots, dodged TV cameramen who aimed at them from above and below, then 
huddled together at center court for one last show of Loyola loyalty, to hold 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
A sign at courtside read: 
</P>
<P>
THE STRONGEST TEAM IN THE WORLD. 
</P>
<P>
And they set out to live up to it. Larger teams, more muscular teams, 
bigger-biceped teams -- such as the Michigan monsters lurking around the corner 
for the winner of Loyola's regional game -- could honestly say that they were 
stronger than the Lions physically. But emotionally? Who in college basketball 
could be stronger than Loyola's players emotionally, considering the events of 
the last couple weeks? 
</P>
<P>
A jump ball finally gave them a chance to show whether their heads were truly 
going to be in the game this night, and next thing anybody knew, the wizards of 
Westchester were taking out every ounce of frustration and exasperation and 
anger on New Mexico State, running and gunning and rebounding, coming at the 
Aggies from every direction, opening up a 9-0 advantage so fast the 
scorekeeper's hand must have shook. 
</P>
<P>
You knew it wouldn't last, couldn't last. You knew that this was sudden and 
savage, strictly a burst of pent-up energy that had to be let loose sometime, 
let loose on some poor someone. And sure enough, Loyola Marymount's feet 
finally started touching the floor again. New Mexico State came back, made a 
game of it, reminded Loyola there was work to do. 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied at halftime. Loyola, you said to yourself, might not have 
any energy left, any emotion left. Might not have much of anything left. 
</P>
<P>
But you forgot that you were watching The Strongest Team in the World here. You 
forgot what made Westhead's team tick, the full-court pressing and the 
perpetual fast-breaking and the shoot-now-pay-later, have-guns-will-travel 
approach to playing that has put the little Catholic school on college 
basketball's map. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Bo Kimble was able to fulfill his mission -- his left-handed free 
throw as homage to Hank -- the score was 66-50 and climbing. Pow! Three-pointer 
by Jeff Fryer. Wham! Steal by Tony Walker. Bam! Basket by Chris Knight. You had 
to count the bodies again, just to be sure Loyola wasn't playing New Mexico 
State 6-against-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions did everything they came to do. They came, they played, they proved 
that life is for the living. They made people smile. They made people's day. 
They raised their hands high above their heads, as though expecting somebody 
from high above to reach down and give them five. He would have if he could 
have. 
</P>
<P>
It was his kind of game, the kind of game at which Loyola Marymount excels, the 
kind of game we have come to expect -- and hope to see more of -- from a team 
we will gladly recognize, from this day , as The Strongest Team in the World.

<P>
Quarterback Andre Ware, who set 25 NCAA records and won the Heisman Trophy in 
1989, announced Friday he will skip his final year at Houston and enter the NFL 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
Ware said he cherished his three years with the Cougars, but a variety of 
reasons led him to take advantage of the opportunity to play professionally. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here today, but we know not what tomorrow brings," Ware said, quoting 
his Sunday School teacher. "I live for today and I didn't want to come back (to 
school) and wonder 'what if I'd left?' and have that doubt in my mind."

No way. This time, while their countrymen await the final ruling on the 
America's Cup, these Yanks and Kiwis are competing in their saltwater element. 
</P>
<P>
In the first round of the best-of-three semifinals Friday, Robbie Haines of 
Newport Beach beat Russell Coutts, the round-robin winner, by 20 seconds; and 
Chris Dickson defeated Peter Isler of San Diego by 24 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
They will complete those series today, then go directly into a best-of-three 
final on the one-mile, windward-leeward course off the east end of the Long 
Beach breakwater. 
</P>
<P>
Coutts, 28, finished the round-robin with a 7-2 record, followed by the three 
others at 6-3. First place entitled Coutts to select his semifinal opponent -- 
who promptly beat hin, convincingly. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the issue, Coutts said: "I'm wondering why I picked Robbie, too." 
</P>
<P>
Dickson, 29, said this week, after losing three consecutive races: "I thought 
the race committee did a great job in equalizing the boats. I wish they could 
do something to equalize the skippers." 
</P>
<P>
In truth, there isn't much difference. In 30 races over the last two days, the 
largest margin of victory has been 1 minute 6 seconds and the smallest Coutts' 
five-second spread over Australia's Peter Gilmour in the round-robin finale. 
</P>
<P>
Dickson, who has won the last six match-racing events on the world circuit, 
beat Isler, 35, by guessing right or anticipating a wind shift when they sailed 
to opposite sides of the course off the starting line. 
</P>
<P>
Haines beat Coutts with a two-second jump at the start that gave him the 
favored position to leeward. Coutts stayed close until two-thirds of the way to 
the weather mark, when the wind shifted just far enough right to force Coutts 
off Haines' hip and into his disturbed air, driving him back. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in a round-robin match against Dickson, Haines had lost by 23 seconds 
after faltering at the start following some frantic pre-start maneuvering 
through the spectator fleet, missing boats by inches. 
</P>
<P>
"The spectator boats were too close," Haines' tactician, Doug Rastello, said. 
"I don't say that as an excuse, but we're spending more time dodging spectator 
boats than judging our position." 
</P>
<P>
Rastello was Rod Davis' tactician when Davis won the first two of his three 
Congressional Cups. He is serving Haines well, since Haines, 36, seemed a 
longshot to reach the final four. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the three others, Haines is not a regular on the match-racing circuit. 
The Newport Beach sail maker was a late replacement for Paul Cayard, who 
withdrew because of his commitment to Italy's Il Moro America's Cup syndicate. 
</P>
<P>
Haines, an '84 Olympic gold medalist, also competed in 1986 but was 
ill-prepared and placed seventh at 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
"We prepared a lot more for this," Haines said.

IT'S FIRE VS. ICE: SOONERS MEET THE TAR HEELS

<P>
When Oklahoma and North Carolina play today in the second round of the Midwest 
Regional, it will be more than merely another NCAA tournament game between 
high-profile programs. It will be a clash of cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma fire vs. Carolina cool, the winner advancing to the Midwest semifinals 
in Dallas to face either Arkansas or Dayton, who will meet in today's other 
second-round game at the University of Texas' Erwin Center. 
</P>
<P>
If Carolina's Dean Smith is college basketball's Mr. Control, Oklahoma's Billy 
Tubbs is its loosest cannon. 
</P>
<P>
Tubbs favors junior college players and four are in his starting lineup. In 29 
years at Carolina, Smith has recruited only one JC player, Bob McAdoo. 
</P>
<P>
"They can come at you with bigger, stronger, more highly publicized players," 
Tubbs said. "I mean, you've got to be a Parade All-American to be even 
considered (by North Carolina). We're outnumbered in Parade All-Americans." 
</P>
<P>
"They rely on JC All-Americans," Smith replied. "We rely on high school 
All-Americans. I prefer college All-Americans." 
</P>
<P>
This hasn't been a normal year for the Tar Heels, who staggered into the 
tournament with 12 losses -- four in their last six games -- and are the 
eighth-seeded team in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina entered the tournament shooting 49.7%, its worst percentage in 
19 seasons. Point guard King Rice is shooting only 40% from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina has a big front line and used its bulk effectively in beating 
Southwest Missouri State in the first round of the tournament. The Tar Heels 
will have to use it again to neutralize Oklahoma's quickness. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma and Carolina have met only once, early in the 1982-83 season at a 
tournament in Hawaii. The Tar Heels won, 77-69, and, as Smith remembers it, 
Tubbs was miffed afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"After the game, he said something like, 'Who do they think they are?' " Smith 
said. "I didn't understand." 
</P>
<P>
The outburst probably was merely part of the OU-against-everybody routine that 
Tubbs has perfected in his 10 years at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps trying to pull his team out of the funk that caused it to struggle 
against 16th-seeded Towson State in the first round, he used Friday's news 
conference to berate the media for dwelling on recent incidents involving 
Skeeter Henry, the senior guard who leads the Sooners in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Henry, who likes to put a charge in Oklahoma fans by firing imaginary six-guns, 
drew a technical for spitting on a Kansas State player during the Sooners' Jan. 
16 loss to the Wildcats, and he received another technical during the Towson 
State game. 
</P>
<P>
"Hammer me. Don't hammer my damn players," Tubbs said. "They're good people. 
Skeeter Henry is a good person. Talk about his classroom turnaround. Go to the 
gutter or the ghettos if you want to write that other trash."

STEPHEN F. AUSTIN TO TEST CS LONG BEACH

Having barely survived what was expected to be an easy first-round game against 
California, the Cal State Long Beach women's basketball team has come here to 
face what probably will be a tougher opponent in Stephen F. Austin. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth-ranked Ladyjacks (27-2) played well enough this season to be selected 
as the No. 3-seeded team in the West. They have lost only once -- to No. 
1-ranked Louisiana Tech -- at home. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's second-round game begins at 5 (PST) and should the 49ers (25-8) 
advance, they will go to Stanford for a semifinal matchup against the winner of 
tonight's Georgia-Arkansas game. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach has not played played very well against ranked teams this season, 
going 4-8 against those in the top 25. For the 49ers to have a chance, they are 
going to have to loosen up, according to Coach Joan Bonvicini. 
</P>
<P>
"Trise (Jackson) and Angie (Lee) were as tight as a drum," Bonvicini said after 
Wednesday night's 87-84 victory over unranked Cal. "I'm so happy just to get 
that game out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
Lee, though she scored 17 points and had 14 rebounds, fouled out with 1:10 
remaining and the 49ers leading by one point. Jackson, one of the fastest 
players in the nation, was at times out of control and finished with 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, they will have gotten any nervousness they might have had out of 
their systems and will be ready to move on," Bonvicini said. 
</P>
<P>
The calmest 49er player on the floor was 6-foot-2 sophomore forward Kari 
Parriott, who in only 28 minutes scored 21 points, including 15 in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way for the Ladyjacks has been Portia Hill, two-time Southland 
Conference player of the year. She is averaging 22.7 points and 10.9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen F. Austin Coach Gary Blair said: "Their style is similar to ours. The 
only difference is, their guards are quicker and they're bigger inside. So, 
basically they've got the size, I've got a little more depth -- I play nine 
kids, she basically plays six or seven."

NFL OWNERS GET TOUGH ON DRUG TESTING, EASE UP ON FREE AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In two of the boldest decisions ever reached at their winter meetings, the 
NFL's leaders this week resolved: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To act unilaterally on steroids, forcing players to undergo unannounced, 
year-round testing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To take a more conciliatory stance in player relations, leading to some 
form of free agency. 
</P>
<P>
In the long term, the league's move toward free agency could prove the more 
historic, bringing the players back into collective bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
Short term, though, the NFL's tougher stance on steroids is causing the most 
commotion. 
</P>
<P>
From Washington, NFL Players Assn. leaders said they won't immediately 
challenge NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue on random steroid testing. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a collective bargaining agreement with the NFL," said Doug 
Allen, the players' assistant executive director. "So we don't have any (base) 
for a protest. 
</P>
<P>
"But if any player feels his rights are being violated, the association will 
assist him in every way it can to make a (courtroom) challenge." 
</P>
<P>
The NFLPA's executive director, Gene Upshaw, was unavailable, but Allen said 
it's impossible to make a judgment on Tagliabue's plan because the 
commissioner's presentation was incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
"How is he going to administer these tests?" Allen asked. "In drug-testing 
programs, the details on exactly how you're going to do it are what's 
important. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, when (the NFLPA) gave (its own street-drug) tests, the results in 
several cases differed from the NFL's. Some of the suspended players were 
(cleared) in our tests." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Allen, Upshaw's assistant for many years, was the target 
of criticism by Tagliabue, who said that he gets along with Upshaw, but that 
"Allen has his own union." 
</P>
<P>
Allen said: "I have no idea what he meant. I've only met the man once." 
</P>
<P>
To some listeners, Tagliabue's remarks seemed to fit into the NFL's 
divide-and-conquer strategy in union relations. There is a feeling that Allen 
is more aggressive than Upshaw in advancing players' rights, prompting NFL 
leaders to act more belligerently toward Allen. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Tagliabue emerged this week as much more of a union basher -- at 
least in public -- than predecessor Pete Rozelle. 
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly, Tagliabue suggested that NFLPA leadership doesn't speak for the 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking office five months ago, Tagliabue has met privately with players 
of four clubs, and this week he sought to create the impression that all were 
solidly against Upshaw and Allen. 
</P>
<P>
"The players kept telling me: 'Save us from our union,' " Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Allen: "That is obviously nonsense. Management is always trying to make 
you believe that the players are being led astray by the leaders. The fact is, 
Upshaw was reelected last June for three years. He was unanimously reelected." 
</P>
<P>
Some attending Tagliabue's first convention as commissioner this week said his 
aggressive stance might have been a pose to intimidate players while he works 
behind the scenes for a quick collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that his actions were milder than his words. Most prominently, 
Tagliabue removed the Management Council's Jack Donlan from responsibility for 
a labor-peace solution and gave it to a new committee of club executives. 
</P>
<P>
Although Donlan will head the committee, the real power has passed to the four 
committee members -- club vice presidents John Shaw of the Rams and Bill Polian 
of Buffalo and club presidents Mike Lynn of Minnesota and Steve Gutman of the 
New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
This group has a mission to develop a peace proposal that will meet most of the 
expectations of most owners and players in the four problem areas -- limited 
free agency, payroll cap, a salary scale for at least younger players and a 
method of financing the plan from, at the least, pooled TV revenue and pooled 
gate receipts. 
</P>
<P>
"The clubs are ready to adopt some such package," Philadelphia owner Norman 
Braman said. "There are far more than 21 votes for something of this kind. What 
(the committee) has to do is develop a plan that will fly." 
</P>
<P>
The league has spent the last three years without a collective bargaining 
agreement with the players because of a disagreement over free agency, which 
the players insist is a precondition, and which the owners have said they will 
never grant. 
</P>
<P>
Why are the owners relenting now? 
</P>
<P>
"They just signed television contracts for more than $3 billion," Donlan said. 
"And they would like to find a way to keep that money." 
</P>
<P>
After signing two lucrative television contracts in the '80s, they found a way 
to spend it -- passing most of it on to the players. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, the players got 59% of the (NFL gross)," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
On some clubs, they got up to 63%. 
</P>
<P>
Can the new committee work out a plan that would be closer to 50-50 for the 
players and owners? 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be hard to do," Lynn said. "The great problem is the disparity 
of income between the richest and (poorest) clubs." 
</P>
<P>
Said Shaw: "Smaller-gross cities will have a harder time (paying for) free 
agents than big cities. We have to find a way around that." 
</P>
<P>
The real question, perhaps, is whether the NFL has embraced free agency too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, NFL players have seemed content with what they have already 
earned -- without the help of collective bargaining contracts. 
</P>
<P>
NFL player salaries average more than $300,000 annually. They went up 30% last 
year and 43% in the last two years -- without any collective agreement -- and 
have continued to rise since the NFLPA recently decertified as a union. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, Upshaw, speaking to a group of players, said: "To paraphrase 
Ronald Reagan, why don't you ask yourself: 'Am I better off now than I was 
three years ago?.' " 
</P>
<P>
Put that way, the problem of a decertified union isn't a problem at all. 
Although the NFL's owners have cut off the players' benefits package -- which 
included severance pay, insurance, and pension contributions -- that package 
was only worth about $25,000 a player per year when it was eliminated. Since 
then, salaries have gone up about $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
Moving toward toward free agency, Tagliabue conceded: "What the players want is 
bidding for their services." 
</P>
<P>
Or as Doug Allen said: "The owners doubled their television income this year by 
playing one network against the other. In other words, they did it with a free 
market. Well, a free market is all we want." 
</P>
<P>
NFL Notes 
</P>
<P>
Roger Staubach and Pat Haden, two of the more celebrated quarterbacks of the 
1970s, were on the NFL's new Former Players Advisory Board that met for the 
first time Friday with Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. They spent six hours 
conferring on drug testing, minority hiring and college eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
One of Haden's principal areas of interest is college eligibility, he said 
after recommending an adaptation of the Joe Paterno system at Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
"Paterno brings in former Penn State players who also played in the NFL to tell 
his squad what it's really like in pro ball," said Haden, a Los Angeles lawyer 
who is also a CBS football analyst. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's new international spring league, the World League, granted its first 
U.S. franchise to Orlando.

UNPROTECTED BY RAMS, HATCHER AGREES TO TERMS WITH PACKERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Punter Dale Hatcher, who became a Plan B free agent when he was left 
unprotected by the Rams, has agreed to a contract with the Green Bay Packers. 
Terms were not announced, but it is believed to be a one-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher, 26, is the third player lost by the Rams because of free agency. 
Guard/center Tony Slaton and safety James Washington have agreed to terms with 
the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher, who was the Rams' third-round draft pick in 1985 out of Clemson, has 
averaged 40.4 yards on 369 punts during his five seasons. However, he averaged 
only 38.8 yards on 73 punts last season. His best season was 1985, when he 
averaged 43.2 yards and was named to the Pro Bowl as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher is expected to succeed Don Bracken, another Plan B free agent. Hatcher 
could not be reached for comment Friday. HELENE ELLIOTT

PLAN DISCLOSED FOR 3 COUNTY RAIL LINES; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: COMPETING PROJECTS WOULD ALL BE BUILT OVER NEXT 11 YEARS IF 
VOTERS APPROVE JUNE BALLOT MEASURES, PLANNERS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Confident that voters will approve billions of dollars in transportation 
spending measures in June, Los Angeles County rail planners on Friday unveiled 
a plan to build three competing rail projects -- a San Fernando Valley 
extension of the downtown Metro Rail, a downtown-to-Pasadena line and a rail 
spur to Los Angeles International Airport -- over the next 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
If the $2.2-billion construction plan is approved later this month by the 
County Transportation Commission, it would head off a bruising fight among the 
Valley, the northeast Los Angeles-Pasadena area and the airport area over which 
one would get the next rail line. 
</P>
<P>
However, in addition to assuming that California voters will add nine cents to 
the gasoline tax on June 5 and approve the sale of $2 billion in rail bonds, 
the plan requires that cities that would benefit from the new lines, especially 
Los Angeles, come up with $309 million. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Peterson, commission executive director, said that if voters do not 
approve the ballot measures, "we don't have a contingency plan. . . . If the 
propositions don't pass, it wipes out this program." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners admitted to being pleasantly surprised at the possibility they 
might not have to choose between the three rival projects, each of which has 
enthusiastic advocates. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any commissioner who has been looking forward to a fight," 
said Commissioner Jackie Bacharach, 
</P>
<P>
Bacharach, who heads the commission's Rail Construction Committee, called 
Peterson's plan a "fantastic concept" but said she would "have to study it more 
before I'm convinced it will work." 
</P>
<P>
The Rancho Palos Verdes councilwoman said she is becoming optimistic about the 
June 5 ballots "because no opposition seems to be forming. But remember that 
under this plan, we also have to have financial help from local officials." 
</P>
<P>
However, Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden, who chairs the council's 
Transportation Committee, Friday promptly rejected any new city contribution, 
saying, "We've given enough to the Metro Rail and we're already on the line for 
any cost overruns in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Holden said he planned to pressure the commission "to start work on the Valley 
line immediately and let the others follow." 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that a majority of the council, which has leverage with the 
commission because it is paying part of the $4-billion cost of building Metro 
Rail from downtown to North Hollywood, would support that strategy. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's Transit Committee is to take up the plan Monday and the full 
commission is expected to vote on it March 28. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Valley project, which has a $1.1-billion price tag, is a 5.6-mile 
extension of the downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro Rail subway westward to the 
San Diego Freeway at Oxnard Street in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
The line would be built in the Southern Pacific railroad freight right of way 
that crosses the Valley parallel to Chandler and Victory boulevards and, in a 
concession to vocal homeowners, would be underground in residential areas of 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The downtown-to-Pasadena project, costing $925 million, would employ the same 
equipment as the nearly completed ground-level Long Beach-Los Angeles 
light-rail line, scheduled to be in operation in July. The Pasadena line, which 
would serve Chinatown and Highland Park, would connect to the Metro Rail subway 
at Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
The 2.5-mile Los Angeles airport spur, expected to cost an estimated $137 
million, would be an extension of the Century Freeway light-rail line northward 
from its western terminus in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
The line, which will employ the same futuristic computer-controlled rail cars 
as the Century Freeway line, would cut across the airport's Lot C en route to a 
terminus in Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson and his staff recommended against extending the system three miles 
more to Marina del Rey, saying that would add little to the line's ridership. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed by the commission staff, construction of the coast line would begin 
next year and be completed when the Century Freeway line opens in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the downtown-to-Pasadena line would begin in 1993 and be 
completed in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the Valley Metro Rail segment would start in 1996 and be finished in 
2001, the same year that the subway is to reach North Hollywood from downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $2.2-billion cost for the three projects, $1.2 billion would come from 
the two transportation propositions on the June ballot which also would finance 
freeway construction and local road improvements. Also, $309 million would come 
from local cities and $700 million would be from the extra half-cent sales tax 
that Los Angeles County voters approved in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The two light rail projects already under way -- the Century Freeway and Long 
Beach-Los Angeles lines -- as well as the local share of the downtown Metro 
Rail, are being financed with the sales tax receipts. 
</P>
<P>
Should Los Angeles refuse to contribute to the construction of three lines, the 
commission staff suggested that stations might be eliminated from the Pasadena 
line or some portions of the line might be single-track, a configuration that 
often slows service because trains must pull onto sidings while others go 
through.

ESCALANTE WILL STILL STAND AND DELIVER AT GARFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEORDAN LEGON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Famous calculus instructor Jaime Escalante has changed his mind about leaving 
Garfield High School and will continue teaching there for at least two more 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Escalante, who said three weeks ago he would resign from the school, possibly 
as early as June, said Friday he had a change of heart after meeting with 
school district officials and receiving more than 500 letters and calls from 
former students and concerned community members. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is cool now," the 59-year-old Escalante said in an interview. "For 
the time being, I will stay here. This is where I belong and the kids 
appreciate what I do." 
</P>
<P>
Escalante, whose success at teaching calculus to inner-city Latino students at 
the East Los Angeles school inspired the 1988 movie "Stand and Deliver," had 
announced he would leave Garfield because of frustration with parents who do 
not value academic achievement, as well as lack of recognition from other 
teachers and inadequate administrative support. 
</P>
<P>
"All those things accumulated, and I decided it was time to pack my bags and be 
on my way," said Escalante, who has taught in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
Garfield Principal Maria Elena Tostado said she is "happy he is staying." 
</P>
<P>
A key factor in his decision to stay at Garfield, Escalante said, was his 
supervision of a National Science Foundation program at East Los Angeles 
College, which draws about 1,000 students every year. The program teaches 
mainly low-income Latino students accelerated mathematics, science and English, 
and also trains teachers in Escalante's methods. 
</P>
<P>
"If I left, I couldn't do the program," he said, adding that 85% of its 
students "are from East L.A., mainly from Garfield. If I left the school, I 
would loose my recruitment network and I would have to give preference to my 
new job." 
</P>
<P>
The Bolivian-born educator is finishing the first year of a three-year contract 
for the program at the college and said he does not feel it is right to leave 
now. "But I cannot predict what will happen" once that commitment is fulfilled, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Escalante said he had received a number of job offers in the past three weeks, 
including teaching positions at USC and Pasadena City College, as well as 
several offers from private businesses. President Bush and Gov. George 
Deukmejian also offered him unspecified federal or state jobs involved with 
education, he said.

A HAPPY ENDING IN HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: NEIGHBORHOOD ESCAPES THE BULLDOZERS. STUDIOS WILL HAVE TO LOOK 
ELSEWHERE TO EXPAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Steve Hunter was making the usual rounds Friday in his Hollywood neighborhood, 
but things were different this time. He was smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I think we've saved the neighborhood!" he yelled as Mary Lou Butler 
peeked out of her white stucco bungalow on Tamarind Avenue. "They've finally 
come around." 
</P>
<P>
It was a welcome change of roles for Hunter, who has had little cause for 
celebration over the last 10 months. The bearded, 36-year-old carpenter has 
written letters, attended City Hall hearings, pleaded to politicians and even 
organized a candlelight vigil in a seemingly futile bid to save his ramshackle 
neighborhood from being bulldozed for film and television industry expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned more about city government than I ever wanted to know," said Hunter, 
flipping through a thick wad of letters and documents on his front porch. "We 
were treated like small potatoes." 
</P>
<P>
But it all paid off on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley and Councilman Michael Woo, who represents Hollywood, joined 
Hunter and a handful of his neighbors at a City Hall press conference to 
announce that they have temporarily blocked pending zone changes for the 
three-block neighborhood that would have allowed the industrial expansion. The 
City Council is expected to approve their proposal on Wednesday and Woo said he 
will "do everything in my power" to ensure that the zone changes never take 
place. 
</P>
<P>
The decision means about 1,000 residents, many of them working-class immigrants 
struggling to make a go of it in their adopted country, can remain in a 
community they have grown to know and love. It also saves at least three 
turn-of-the-century bungalows on Tamarind -- including one said to have been 
the home of the late actor Jay Silverheels, who played Tonto in the TV series 
"The Lone Ranger" -- that were slated to be demolished for industrial projects. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like Christmas," said Linda Chalikian-De Fazio, who lives in a small 
apartment building across the street from the Silverheels bungalow. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next year or two, the neighborhood of modest homes and apartment 
buildings -- some with rents under $400 a month -- will be untouched while the 
city looks for other areas to encourage entertainment industry development, Woo 
said. The neighborhood had been targeted for entertainment use by the city 
because it is sandwiched between the Sunset-Gower Studios and KTLA one block 
south of Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"It became apparent to me that we were headed for potential disaster when a 
magnificent neighborhood was about to be eliminated by virtue of a zone 
change," Bradley said. "This neighborhood has the kind of diversity, has the 
kind of mix, that we are all very proud of in this city." 
</P>
<P>
No one along the 1400 blocks of Tamarind, Bronson and Gordon avenues used words 
like magnificent to describe their corner of Hollywood on Friday, but they all 
seemed to agree that it didn't deserve to be flattened for new sound studios. 
They complained about the usual things -- graffiti, crime and the boarded-up 
building down the block -- but they also boasted about the not-so-usual. 
</P>
<P>
"We all get along quite well here," said Butler, who moved to the neighborhood 
from St. Louis 30 years ago with her family. "It is a nice neighborhood. It is 
home." 
</P>
<P>
City officials say plans have called for limited industrial development in the 
neighborhood since 1973. But problems first arose last year when the City 
Council moved to change the residential zoning to industrial to conform with 
the plans. Hunter and others say they were never notified of the proposal, and 
learned about it only last June when a developer published a legal notice 
announcing he would demolish a nearby house. 
</P>
<P>
Residents quickly turned to Woo, but the councilman initially offered little 
assistance. In a letter to residents last August, Woo promised to help them 
find new housing, but he said he supported the zone change because it promoted 
the entertainment industry in Hollywood and would create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The residents kept badgering the councilman and in October Woo offered another 
solution. He said the city would provide residential property owners with 
low-interest loans to rehabilitate their homes and apartments, while also 
creating strict "design review guidelines" for the switch to industrial 
buildings. The zone change would stick, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the press conference Friday, Woo said changing his mind was not easy. "One 
of the toughest choices we face . . . is how to achieve the goals of providing 
affordable housing but also providing jobs for people in the area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents, who credit Bradley's interest in their plight for Woo's change of 
heart, said they are relieved that the councilman finally sees things their 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I can get about my business and do some work on this house," Butler said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT FRENCH TO RETIRE IN 
JUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District, who saw the 
school system through its first-ever strike last fall, announced Friday that he 
will retire at the end of this school year. 
</P>
<P>
Robert L. French, 59, will step down June 30, school board president Frank 
Fenton said. Fenton said the resignation was accepted "with deep regret" and 
noted that French "has been with us during a very difficult period for this 
district." 
</P>
<P>
French called his three years as superintendent "rewarding and challenging." He 
said he will remain available as a consultant and plans to become a university 
instructor. Sol Levine, assistant superintendent for curriculum, will become 
acting superintendent.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CONGRESS HEARS CITIES' PLIGHT OVER 
BILLBOARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agoura Hills Councilwoman Fran Pavley, reflecting on her city's futile 
eight-year fight to remove 30 billboards along the Ventura Freeway, told a 
House subcommittee in Washington Thursday that local governments should be 
given the clout to banish roadside signs. 
</P>
<P>
Pavley testified before a subcommittee of the House Public Works Committee that 
the key impediment under current federal law is a requirement that localities 
compensate billboard companies. 
</P>
<P>
Local governments must reimburse the owner for the sign's value as well as for 
the revenues that would be lost by dismantling it. This has allowed the firms 
to set their own price, which can be as much as $100,000, Pavely said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN TRIES TO RETRIEVE MODEL PLANE, FALLS 
OFF CLIFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who climbed over the side of a cliff to retrieve a model plane Friday 
tumbled and fell about 225 feet and suffered minor injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Gittens, 32, of Redondo Beach, had gone to the seaside cliff in the 800 
block of Paseo del Mar to fly a remote-controlled model plane, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The cliff is a popular spot for model airplane enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
About 1:20 p.m., Gittens climbed over the cliff's edge to retrieve the plane 
from a spot about 20 feet below the top when he slipped in the soft dirt, 
tumbling and falling about 225 feet, officials said. A Los Angeles County Fire 
Department crew found Gittens partially conscious and flew him to Harbor-UCLA 
Medical Center, where he was treated for extensive lacerations.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $60,000 IN JEWELS TAKEN FROM COUPLE AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Chinese nightclub owner and his wife were robbed Friday of nearly $60,000 in 
jewels at their home near La Puente, the second residential holdup this week of 
an Asian family in the east San Gabriel Valley, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a retired Vietnamese couple were assaulted at their Diamond Bar 
home and robbed of more than $40,000 in cash, jewelry and guns. 
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old husband fractured his foot when he tried to escape by jumping 
from the window of a second-story bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
While detectives do not have any evidence that the two cases are related, they 
said both assaults were committed by Asian youths and are part of a growing 
trend of Asian-on-Asian home robberies in suburban immigrant communities. Asian 
families are sometimes preyed on because they often store valuables at home and 
have learned in their native countries to fear retribution if they cooperate 
with police, authorities say.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 CONVICTED OF BILKING INVESTORS OF $13 
MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal court jury Friday convicted a stockbroker and an investment manager 
of bilking a group of unwary investors, including a group of nuns in South 
Dakota and retired armed forces personnel throughout the nation, out of $13 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The jury convicted Daniel Burkhart of Camarillo and Gina Loren of Stateline, 
Nev., on 20 criminal counts, including conspiracy, securities fraud, bank fraud 
and wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
They face fines of up to $5 million and prison sentences of up to 100 years. 
Assistant U.S. Atty. James R. Asperger said the two also could be ordered to 
pay restitution of $4.1 million. Investors believed they would get a high 
return for their money, but the defendants used the money themselves, 
prosecutors said, with Loren purchasing a $1.6-million house in Orange.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT RATE FALLS TO 35% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The historically poor high school dropout rate in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District improved somewhat for the class of 1989. The dropout rate was 
35% for the class that graduated last year, a decrease from the 39.2% chalked 
up by the class of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
While the improvement in the numbers of students who stay in school was 
registered among all the racial and ethnic groups that make up the district, it 
is still disproportionately high among blacks. Black students account for 15.8% 
of the district's enrollment, yet they had a 44.4% dropout rate, down from the 
46% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos, who make up 61.6% of enrollment, had a dropout rate of 36.2%, compared 
to 40.1% in 1988. The rates also improved for whites, who make up 14.5% of the 
students. Dropouts in that group were 27.8% in 1989, down from 33.8% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide average was about 23% in 1988, the last year for which statistics 
are available. The Los Angeles district spends $3.6 million of its own funds on 
dropout prevention and receives another $1.7 million for that purpose from 
federal, state and corporate grants.

TEEN RUN OVER IN DAYLIGHT GANG ATTACK IN RESEDA LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Business operators and customers at a busy Reseda shopping center were still 
stunned Friday by an unusual daylight attack on a 17-year-old boy who was 
chased by bat-wielding gang members through the center's parking lot and run 
over twice by a car. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police said dozens of witnesses at the shopping center watched in 
horror as the boy was run down Thursday afternoon, apparently in a gang fight. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Escalante, 17, of Reseda was left unconscious with massive internal 
injuries by the 3:15 p.m. attack in the 18300 block of Vanowen Street, police 
said. He was in critical condition Friday at Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Escalante is an associate of a Reseda gang and the five youths in the car that 
ran him down are members of a rival Canoga Park gang, police said. No arrests 
were made. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the attack, apparently motivated by an earlier dispute, was unusual 
because it occurred in a public place where as many as 50 bystanders saw it. 
</P>
<P>
"This was in broad daylight," Detective Rick Swanston said. "They were very 
blatant about it. They acted like they didn't care who saw them." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a frightening thing," said Dale Geffre, a nearby resident who saw the 
attack from a fish-and-chips restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys didn't care who they took out. They got the kid they were after but 
30 seconds earlier I was standing right there and it could have been me. It's a 
sad situation when you see something like this happening here -- the disregard 
they showed," Geffre said. 
</P>
<P>
Swanston said the attack "was very fast -- nobody could have stopped it," but 
that one witness ran to Escalante's side and may have saved him from being run 
over a third time. He would not identify the witness for fear of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses provided investigators with detailed descriptions of the 
suspects, their car and its license plate number. The car, which had been 
reported stolen Thursday, was found abandoned Friday morning in Canoga Park. 
Swanston said the information from witnesses was used to identify two suspects 
and police were searching for them. 
</P>
<P>
The shopping center was particularly busy at the time of the attack because 
classes at nearby Reseda High School had just ended for the day and students 
had gone to the stores and fast-food restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Escalante was walking through the shopping center lot when he was sighted by 
members of a rival gang who were driving a blue Camaro. The car stopped and two 
gang members with baseball bats chased Escalante past a Lucky supermarket and 
to the corner of the parking lot near Vanowen Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The car circled the lot and hit Escalante, knocking him into a parked car and 
then to the ground before running over him. The driver backed over Escalante, 
smashing into another car before speeding away, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I thought maybe there had been an accident," said a woman who saw the 
assault. "But then he intentionally backed up. I saw the car bump up and down 
and I thought, 'Oh my goodness, how could they do that?' It was awful." 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who operates a fast-food restaurant in the shopping center, said she 
was aware that gang members frequent the area, but said they caused no previous 
problems. "It makes me want to move," she said Friday. "I thought about it all 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators traced the attack on Escalante to two earlier gang clashes. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, gang members in two cars -- including the blue Camaro -- 
exchanged insults at a traffic signal on Parthenia Street at Lindley Avenue and 
smashed windows of each others' cars. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the blue Camaro was sighted by rival gang members at Reseda Park. The 
gang members, along with Escalante -- who did not take part in the earlier 
street confrontation -- chased the car from the park, police said. Less than an 
hour later, while Escalante was walking alone through the shopping center, he 
was attacked.

<P>
ARCHITECTURE: TENANTS TACKLE PROBLEMS AT A FADED BUT SPECIAL HOLLYWOOD 
APARTMENT BUILDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Bruce McKane, a florist with an eye for architectural detail, lives at Highland 
Towers, an old Hollywood apartment-hotel with carved wood cornices, a rooftop 
garden and a basement swimming pool that, though it has been out of use for 
decades, is a curious reminder of the grand history of the building, as well as 
Hollywood itself. 
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old steel and concrete structure is a bit tattered now, but McKane 
sees past that. He loves the sweeping city view from his fifth-floor unit, and 
he especially loves the rent: $500 a month. 
</P>
<P>
What McKane doesn't love is that the building's elevator has been out of order 
for the last six weeks and that the heat hasn't worked for more than a month. 
And so he has joined in what might be called the tenant revolution of Highland 
Towers. 
</P>
<P>
It all began a month ago, in the laundry room, where two of McKane's neighbors 
held an impromptu gripe session in between the wash and dry cycles. They formed 
the Tenants Coalition for Preservation of Tenants' Rights, a long name for a 
loosely organized group whose members have been filing complaints like crazy -- 
and have, in the process, learned a little about the bureaucracy, as well as 
one another. 
</P>
<P>
"I started off with Councilman (Michael) Woo's office," said Mike Yabroff, one 
of the laundry room conspirators and the unofficial leader of the 20-member 
group. "I have been to the building inspectors, the heating inspectors, the 
elevator inspectors, the county Health Department, rent stabilization. . . . I 
don't think that there's an agency that we didn't call." 
</P>
<P>
With more than 720,000 apartments in Los Angeles and a broad spectrum of 
agencies to which renters can complain, city officials estimate that thousands 
of tenants take some form of action against their landlords each year. Anna 
Ortega, assistant director of rent stabilization for the city, said frustrated 
tenants are increasingly banding together on the theory that there is strength 
in numbers. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Highland Towers, the tenants' group has prompted at least two 
citations -- one from the Health Department, which gave owner Herbert Cowan 
until Wednesday to fix the heat, and another from the city Building and Safety 
Department, which ordered that the elevator be repaired by last Monday. With 
that deadline come and gone, inspector Cecil Smith said the matter may be 
referred to the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan, meanwhile, says he is trying his best to fix the problems. "I don't 
break these things," he said. "They are old, they had a problem and it will be 
taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
But McKane and other tenants say their landlord hasn't moved fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
The tenants -- an eclectic mix that includes a retired artist, a young 
guitarist who attends the nearby Musicians Institute of Technology, a singer 
who says he has "been a headliner in the city for 20 years," a collections 
clerk for United Parcel Service and a 78-year-old woman who needed help walking 
up the stairs -- said they banded together only after getting no response to 
their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Hollywood," said McKane. "This is not a neighborhood kind of place. It 
has taken a lot of frustration to bring us together." 
</P>
<P>
Building manager Maurice (he won't give his last name; "It's a family name," he 
explained) acknowledged that, what with all the inspectors parading through, 
life has been sort of tense around Highland Towers of late. He lamented that 
the six-story, 48-unit apartment building at 1922 Highland Avenue is not the 
friendly place it once was. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard enough of it," Maurice said with a sigh. "They blame me and give me 
dirty notes. I'm talking about dirty notes -- four-letter words, which is 
really cheap. . . . They're mad and they take it out on me. I wish I could be 
like Jeannie on television and I could blink and it would be, like, perfect." 
</P>
<P>
But until the building is perfect -- or at least has heat and a working 
elevator -- the members of the Tenants Coalition for Preservation of Tenants' 
Rights say they will not abandon the cause. They have just served Cowan with a 
formal "demand letter" instructing him to fix the code violations by next 
Wednesday.

WHOLESALE PRICES STABLE AS ENERGY COSTS DECLINE; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE UNDERLYING CORE RATE OF INFLATION -- WHICH EXCLUDES THE VOLATILE 
FOOD AND ENERGY COMPONENTS -- SETTLED AT 3.7%, A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT.

<P>
The unexpected surge in energy costs that drove wholesale prices up so 
dramatically in January reversed itself last month, returning inflation to the 
relatively moderate pace that prevailed during most of 1989, the government 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
After soaring 13.6% in January, largely because of a record cold spell that 
caught fuel suppliers short, energy prices plunged 5% in February as the winter 
weather thawed and demand eased. 
</P>
<P>
Food prices, which also spurted in January as a result of the freeze, rose more 
slowly in February. 
</P>
<P>
The bursting of January's "price bubble" left the Labor Department's overall 
wholesale price index unchanged during February -- offsetting at least part of 
a 1.8% rise recorded in the January surge. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said energy prices most likely would continue declining during March. 
</P>
<P>
The index showed the underlying "core" rate of inflation for the three-month 
period that ended in February -- a more stable measure of inflation that 
excludes the volatile food and energy components -- at an annual rate of 3.7%, 
a slight improvement from the previous period. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation at the retail level is running a bit higher, at annual rates of 4% to 
4.5%. 
</P>
<P>
January's 1.8% rise was the biggest jump in wholesale prices of any month since 
the early 1970s. However, analysts shrugged it off at the time, predicting -- 
as it eventually occurred -- that the "price bubble" would prove temporary. 
</P>
<P>
Economists were optimistic after Friday's report. Donald Ratajczak, a Georgia 
State University economist, said he had "been looking . . . to see if we can 
find any early warning signals of higher inflation, and it seems we aren't 
finding any." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's report left the overall producer price index in February at 117.4% of 
its 1982 base-period -- meaning that it took $11.74 to buy the same cross 
section of goods last month that cost $10 in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Board reported separately that industrial 
production rose 0.6% in February, rebounding from a 1% drop in January that had 
stemmed primarily from layoffs in the auto industry. However, that industry 
continued to suffer through one of its worst periods in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Although auto assemblies rose sharply in February, overall output was 10% below 
its level of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Reaser, economist for First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, said the 
slowing of wholesale prices of crude materials and intermediate goods reported 
Friday reflected continued weakness in the industrial sector. 
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, the Commerce Department said housing starts fell 7% in February, 
in part because the cold weather that swept the country during the month 
delayed apartment construction in some regions.

BAR ENDS PROBE OF LINCOLN FIGURES TIED TO GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying it had found no evidence of wrongdoing, the State Bar of California on 
Friday ended its investigation into the ethical conduct of three individuals 
closely tied to Gov. George Deukmejian over their role in the Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The State Bar, in a statement issued late Friday, said an "absence of evidence" 
ended its probe into the activities of Deukmejian fund-raiser Karl M. Samuelian 
of Los Angeles; the governor's law partner, Franklin Tom, and state 
Corporations Commissioner Christine W. Bender. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was being closed "without prejudice," the Bar said, leaving 
open the option that the case could be reopened if new evidence is uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
The three were being investigated for a possible conflict of interest in the 
sale and regulatory approval of uninsured, high-risk bonds issued by Lincoln's 
corporate parent. 
</P>
<P>
The Bar's decision removes one of a plethora of probes over the collapse of 
Irvine-based Lincoln Savings and the bankruptcy filing of the parent, American 
Continental Corp. of Phoenix. Dozens of lawsuits and state and federal 
investigations are pending in what could become, at an estimated $2 billion, 
the single most costly thrift failure ever. The three lawyers cleared by the 
Bar face the wrath of plaintiffs in a number of lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it completely vindicates me," Bender said about the Bar's decision. 
"I'm delighted they came to the conclusion that I knew all along they would 
come to." 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for Samuelian and Tom said they were pleased that the Bar agreed to 
close its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be clear to everyone that Karl Samuelian and Franklin Tom are people 
of the highest integrity who honestly and competently represented their 
clients," said their lawyer, Seth Aronson of O'Melveny &amp; Myers. 
</P>
<P>
The State Bar, which monitors lawyer conduct, initiated a preliminary probe in 
November based on news reports and other information it had. News of the 
investigation was revealed two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Samuelian and Tom represented American Continental in its efforts to win state 
approval to sell debt securities at Lincoln's 29 Southern California branches. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly $200 million in debt securities was sold to some 22,000 small investors 
at Lincoln branches. Most investors were elderly Lincoln depositors who say 
they were encouraged by Lincoln and American Continental employees to put their 
funds into the bonds. The investors said salespeople led them to believe that 
the bonds were insured and as safe as their deposits in Lincoln. But the bonds 
were not insured, and many lost their life savings. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for bondholders, who have filed 17 lawsuits to get their money back, 
would not comment on the State Bar's action. 
</P>
<P>
Their pending lawsuits, however, name Tom and Samuelian's Los Angeles firm as 
defendants. Seven suits filed in Orange County Superior Court also name the 
state as a defendant for the role the Corporations Department played in 
approving the bond sales. 
</P>
<P>
Bender's office approved the second of two public offerings of American 
Continental debt securities. Tom, her predecessor, approved the first offering. 
</P>
<P>
After returning to private practice in early 1987, Tom and Samuelian and others 
at Parker, Milliken, Clark, O'Hara &amp; Samuelian met with Bender several 
times to counter information her agency had developed on American Continental's 
apparent inability to repay the debt it wanted to issue. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the department approved the offering for sale.

VALDEZ OIL SPILL CONTROVERSY CONTINUES; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: ALASKA AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS ARE WORRIED THAT THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT MAY NOT PUSH EXXON TO FULLY RESTORE PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A meeting of agencies charged with assessing natural-resource damage from 
Exxon's Alaska oil spill has fueled suspicions among environmentalists and 
Alaska state officials about federal intentions. 
</P>
<P>
They fear that the federal government -- particularly the Justice Department -- 
won't adequately press Exxon to restore Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon has spent about $2 billion so far cleaning up the oil, and this week 
announced that it would continue that effort this year. Still to come, however, 
under provisions of the Superfund law and Clean Water Act, is the cost of 
restoring wildlife and habitat damaged in the disaster. Recent surveys of the 
sound by such groups as the Cousteau Society suggest massive -- and potentially 
expensive -- injury to animals, beaches and the once-pure waters. 
</P>
<P>
Some environmentalists, while stressing that at this stage any estimates are 
highly speculative, have said natural-resources restoration could run from 
several million dollars to more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The draft minutes, currently circulating privately in Washington, New York and 
Alaska, describe a March 2, 1990, meeting of state and federal natural resource 
regulators and the Washington Policy Group, which includes policy-makers from 
the Office of Management and Budget, the Environmental Protection Agency, the 
White House and the Justice Department. In the minutes, Justice Department 
representatives appear to characterize the U.S. public's mood as unreasonably 
vindictive toward Exxon, saying "the public would not be satisfied unless 
Exxon's assets were essentially depleted and all board members put in jail . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
Justice representatives also announced that the agencies "should not expect 
further money from Exxon" beyond $15 million that the company has spent already 
to fund studies of spill damage, according to the draft minutes. Interior 
Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. has asked Exxon for $20.4 million more to pay for 
last year's studies, and has been expected to call for more funds to continue 
the work in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not reached a decision on the additional $20 million," said one Exxon 
official who declined to be named. 
</P>
<P>
"The state (of Alaska) is quite concerned at what appears to be a shortage of 
financial resources to carry forward the work of the trustees," said Gregg 
Erickson, director of oil spill assessment and restoration for the Alaska 
Department of Fish and Game. "(The meeting) naturally concerns us because we 
need a good assessment of the damages. . . . It could make it difficult for us 
to recover the damages, it's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
"We are very, very concerned that the federal agencies will be able to carry 
out the needed studies . . . and therefore provide a firm foundation for 
recovering damages from Exxon," said Sarah Chasis, a senior attorney with the 
Natural Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
The NRDC, along with the National Wildlife Federation, the Wildlife Federation 
of Alaska and other private individuals and groups, also is suing Exxon for 
damages to Alaska's natural resources. They and the state of Alaska hope the 
federal agencies take the lead in assessing the costs of restoring the sound. 
</P>
<P>
Chasis, who has seen the minutes, said, "My God, they're really bitter about 
the fact that the plea bargain was killed." Recently, Justice Department 
attempts to forge a settlement with Exxon of criminal and reportedly some civil 
charges fell apart when the State of Alaska angrily refused to agree to what it 
considered a premature and inadequate assessment of the cost of restoration. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department representatives at the meeting are described as saying that 
"the settlement offer accepted by Exxon, but turned down by Alaska, was a very 
good offer." The settlement would have set up a $150-million restoration fund, 
to be increased only with Exxon's agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Friday, representatives of the Justice Department and at least one of 
the federal agencies at the center of policy discussions, maintained that the 
government is not retreating from the fray. 
</P>
<P>
"We're proceeding on the assumption that we're going to litigate, and that 
Exxon will be arraigned in court in April," said Amy Casner of the Justice 
Department, which will serve as trial lawyer for the Department of the Interior 
and other federal trustees charged with responsibility for restoring the 
environment of the sound. 
</P>
<P>
Casner declined to speak of the meeting minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Goldstein, chief spokesman for the Interior Department, doesn't think 
that any reluctance at Justice would inhibit prosecution of Exxon anyway. "We 
are the clients," said Goldstein, "and they (Justice) act on behalf of the 
clients." 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein also sees little long-term difficulty if Exxon decides not to 
continue paying to assess damage to the sound. "The secretary (Lujan) has made 
it very clear to Exxon that we are going to hold their feet to the fire," said 
Goldstein, "and that they . . . will either pay now or they will pay later." 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein believes that Exxon may be reluctant to pay more for damage 
assessments because it is getting ready to go to court. "They're positioning 
themselves for a court case," said Goldstein, "and that's unfortunate because 
they've acknowledged publicly that they have a responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Chasis and others see a worrisome pattern in Justice Department actions. 
</P>
<P>
"They tried to enter into this plea-bargain arrangement a couple of weeks ago, 
and we felt that was really giving away the store," said Chasis. "And I just 
learned yesterday that they were trying to cut back significantly on the 
studies that the state and federal governments (are making to assess damage.) 
</P>
<P>
"Exxon has leverage at this point because the federal government doesn't have 
the money to put into that assessment," she continued, "so that's a bargaining 
chip that Exxon has. . . . They may not want to provide that money unless they 
get something in return." 
</P>
<P>
"hen a department like ours has a budget of $5 (billion) to 7 billion dollars," 
countered Bob Walker, an Interior Department spokesman, "we'll find the money."

Simmons Comment Draws Attention: Harold C. Simmons, the Texas financier waging 
a proxy fight against the Lockheed Corp., reportedly said he would sell a major 
subsidiary if he gets control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons told reporters in Boston that he would put Lockheed Sanders Inc. on the 
block, according to news reports. However, a spokesman for Simmons said the 
comments were taken out of context, adding that Simmons indicated a willingness 
to sell Lockheed Sanders only if he determines that its operations cannot be 
made more profitable. Lockheed Sanders, a major employer in Nashua, N.H., 
produces radar-blocking equipment and other electronic equipment.

BTR Launches Bid for Norton: British industrial conglomerate BTR PLC launched a 
surprise $1.64-billion cash bid for Massachusetts plastics and ceramics group 
Norton Co., one of the first major takeover offers in a quiet year for mergers 
and acquisitions. Norton's stock price skyrocketed nearly 30%, or $16.625, to 
$74.875 as investors speculated on whether BTR would prevail, even if Norton 
fights the bid. Norton, based in Worcester, said it would consider the offer.

Bidermann Industries Corp. said Friday that it has agreed to buy three 
divisions of Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co. at a price an analyst said was well 
below what cash-strapped industrialist William Farley had hoped to get. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase price was about $350 million cash and a $60-million note. The sale 
follows renegotiation with bankers Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Bankers Trust Co. 
of a $1.2-billion loan, which buys Farley more time to complete his takeover of 
Georgia-based Pepperell.

Want to get audited by the Internal Revenue Service? Of course not. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, only about one in 100 taxpayers actually faces this dreaded 
experience each year. You can reduce your odds of being one of them this tax 
season by knowing the red flags that catch IRS examiners' attention -- and 
either avoiding those items or making sure you have the proper documentation to 
make your claims less suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the most common red flags, gleaned from experts familiar with 
IRS procedures: 
</P>
<P>
Excessive red ink. Expect IRS heat if you claim deductions for small-business 
losses several years in a row, says Judy C. Keisling, director of tax training 
at H&amp;R Block. 
</P>
<P>
IRS eyebrows also are raised when you claim business expenses that appear to be 
out of line with your business income. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of cash income. The IRS is always wary of folks who receive large amounts 
of income in cash; in an audit, the agency may ask to see your bank deposit 
statements to make sure it's all reported, says Sidney Kess, a New York tax 
attorney and CPA. 
</P>
<P>
Large home office deductions. Examiners will look to see if you take deductions 
exceeding the income from your home office activities minus certain expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Big round numbers. Claiming a large, flat amount -- say $5,000 -- for 
charitable or other deductions is an invitation to hot water. 
</P>
<P>
Child-care deductions lacking documentation. The IRS will look out for 
taxpayers who ignore the new rule for 1989 returns requiring you to provide the 
Social Security or taxpayer identification number of the care provider. 
</P>
<P>
Improper personal interest writeoffs. The tax cops will scrutinize folks who 
try to deduct interest expenses on credit card or other non-mortgage loans as 
business expenses on Schedule C as a way to avoid the 20% limit on such 
deductions, Kess says. 
</P>
<P>
Excessive company car writeoffs. Examiners are watching for higher writeoffs 
than allowed for business use of a car. 
</P>
<P>
Improper miscellaneous deductions. IRS buzzers may go off if you try to deduct 
such items as tax preparation fees as a business expense to escape the rule 
limiting such miscellaneous deductions to amounts that exceed 2% of your 
adjusted gross income. 
</P>
<P>
Casualty and theft losses. To reduce suspicion, attach evidence -- insurance 
claims, police reports -- showing the disaster and value of your property 
before and after; consider attaching a letter explaining what happened. 
</P>
<P>
Extreme generosity. The feds are wary of charitable contribution deductions 
that seem unreasonably high for your income. For example, if you make between 
$30,000 and $40,000, the average donation writeoff is $1,005; deductions a lot 
larger than that could trigger suspicions, Kess says. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the IRS looks carefully at non-cash contributions. File Form 8283 and 
consider attaching appraisals if you deduct more than $500 for gifts of art, 
land or other non-cash assets. 
</P>
<P>
Potentially abusive tax shelters. IRS alarms go off whenever you claim 
writeoffs from limited partnerships investing in such things as mining 
ventures, movies and recordings. 
</P>
<P>
Returns filed by unscrupulous tax preparers. The IRS keeps a list of preparers 
with track records of filing fraudulent returns. If your preparer is on this 
hit list, there's a higher chance you'll be audited. 
</P>
<P>
Should you be discouraged from taking big deductions? Of course not. Just be 
sure you have proof. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have large deductions or large casualty losses or high business 
expenses that you can document, don't let that dissuade you from putting them 
on your return," H&amp;R Block's Keisling says. "The fact that you're going to 
be audited doesn't mean they will be disallowed."

RICK DU BROW: THRIVING IN HEAT OF ADVERSITY; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: DESPITE HEART BYPASS SURGERY AND THE PERSONAL PROBLEMS OF HIS 
CO-STAR HOWARD ROLLINS, CARROLL O'CONNOR IS HAPPY IN HIS WORK.

<TEXT>
<P>
Carroll O'Connor is sitting at a corner table in his Beverly Hills restaurant, 
contemplating the past year. He's never been through anything like it. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I certainly haven't," he says, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago this month, O'Connor underwent heart bypass surgery at an Atlanta 
hospital, a short drive from the Covington, Ga., set of his NBC series, "In the 
Heat of the Night." 
</P>
<P>
He recovered quickly, returned to the show and, instead of easing off, 
increased his workload by taking over as co-executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
The police series has also undergone another crisis in its two years on the air 
as O'Connor's co-star, Howard Rollins, fought his own private battle, which 
first came to light following his 1988 arrest in Louisiana for drug possession 
and drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor says he's "very fond" of the talented young actor, who, he adds, has a 
"life's task" of recovery -- but is also a valuable partner on the show. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this history of headaches, "In the Heat of the Night" powered into the 
Top 10 programs in this week's national ratings -- an amazing survivor of a 
chain of events that might have killed off another series. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's dedication to the show, in which he plays a Southern police chief 
and Rollins is his top detective, has been typically relentless. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied we've turned in a good season in my first season as executive 
producer (with Fred Silverman)," says O'Connor, 65. "But I'm not satisfied with 
that. I think we can do even better." 
</P>
<P>
He adds: "The only thing that was on my mind after last season, counting in the 
operation and recuperation, was to get control of this series. And I wasn't 
thinking of backing off or taking any rest or vacations." 
</P>
<P>
The success of the program, which was renewed Wednesday for next season, has 
finally given O'Connor a new image to replace his greatest role -- that of the 
bigot Archie Bunker in "All in the Family." 
</P>
<P>
But has the extra work been worth it? How's O'Connor feeling a year after the 
surgery? 
</P>
<P>
Digging into a luncheon salad at The Ginger Man restaurant, soon to be renamed 
Carroll O'Connor's Place, the actor says: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to be able to tell all prospective heart patients that I feel better 
than I did before the operation. I had six blockages that they bypassed, and 
now the arteries are open. It's bound to make you feel better. 
</P>
<P>
"I ride the stationary bicycle. When I was down in Georgia, I walked a 
treadmill. Back home, I can go down to the beach in Malibu and walk. They told 
me I didn't have to get into calisthenics. I don't walk as much as I should. 
I've got to get with it more." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's year to remember was full of highlights -- including one that 
"delighted" him, a fifth Emmy Award for best leading actor, honoring him for 
"In the Heat of the Night." He was also inducted into the TV academy's Hall of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
But his consuming passion, he says, has been the scripts for "In the Heat of 
the Night." He writes some and "I've rewritten everything. You do not have the 
freedom to do your best acting working with a piece of material in which you 
have no belief, no confidence, because then you're bound up with inhibitions 
and fear and you can't act. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the first thing is your health. But assuming I wasn't going to devote 
the rest of my life, or what's left, to making sure I get as many years as I 
can -- once I said I'll keep working -- then the first priority was controlling 
the series creatively. There was no sense in going on with it and not having 
control because I simply would have had a heart attack in spite of the 
bypasses, because the stress of doing things that you detest is indescribable. 
It is for me. I just cannot live with something that I not only don't like, but 
don't respect." 
</P>
<P>
Following his successful surgery, O'Connor took out a Hollywood trade paper ad 
humorously suggesting that he might be easier to get along with. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of executives in the business," he laughs, "have found me to be, to say 
the least, a cranky fellow. So I was really saying to them that I was feeling 
better and that I might be a more acceptable personality. 
</P>
<P>
"We're back to the writing again. From the time I did 'All in the Family,' I've 
always been very cranky about the material, and I used to get into bitter 
arguments with writers, directors and producers, saying, 'This is wrong' or 'I 
don't like this' or 'This is not funny.' And they'd become furious. I wasn't 
always right. And I'm very sorry for losing my temper and being a boor during 
'All in the Family.' " 
</P>
<P>
Doing "In the Heat of the Night," says O'Connor, "I tend not to be a bully, 
but" -- he admits -- "now and then I give way to temper and take up a bullying 
stance, for which I'm sorry. It's all about material." 
</P>
<P>
The material, plus the teaming of O'Connor and Rollins, has indeed worked 
wonders in head-on competition with ABC's top-rated "Roseanne." In last week's 
ratings, for instance, "Roseanne" drew 33% of the national audience while "In 
the Heat of the Night" was a strong contender with 27%. In the past season, the 
O'Connor-Rollins series cut "Roseanne's" advantage in total TV homes by 28%. 
</P>
<P>
During their personal health tribulations while on the weekly one-hour program, 
O'Connor and Rollins have expressed concern for each other's well-being. Each 
missed several episodes because of their problems, Rollins just a few months 
ago. O'Connor acknowledges that actors with problems can ask to leave a 
project, but bristles at the notion that Rollins might not be back on the show 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all," says O'Connor, "I missed him professionally from the show. 
Second of all, I missed him personally because I'm very fond of this man. He is 
a very charming, endearing person. He's witty. He's fun. He's a very amiable 
companion." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor says that he phoned his co-star several times when he was recovering 
in a clinic during his recent absence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd just ask him, 'You want a report on what we're doing?' 'Yeah, tell me.' 
I'd say, 'Well, we did this and this and this.' It's kind of silly to give 
advice. A person is in a recovery place, he's getting advice from people and 
suggestions and orders all day long. You spend about three or four minutes on 
the phone. You try to be funny and cheerful and say, 'We love you and we miss 
you.' " 
</P>
<P>
During the past year, "In the Heat of the Night" almost seemed jinxed. In 
addition to the problems of O'Connor and Rollins, Silverman also suffered a 
heart attack, from which he, too, has recovered. "I have thought the very same 
thing," says O'Connor. "We've had a lot of bad luck." 
</P>
<P>
But now it's on to next season, and O'Connor says he no longer wants to spend 
seven months a year on location in Georgia doing "In the Heat of the Night." 
MGM-TV President David Gerber, Silverman and the actor are deciding on filming 
plans, based on cost and how to retain the flavor of the show if some or most 
of it is shot here.

UKRAINIAN CATHOLICS FIGHT TO REGAIN CHURCHES SEIZED IN '46; 
</P>
<P>
HISTORY: THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN UKRAINE, THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH IS UNDER 
PRESSURE TO RETURN PLACES OF WORSHIP. 
</P>

<P>
MSHANA, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 44 years, the Catholics of Mshana have had no place to pray. 
</P>
<P>
Like all other Ukrainian Catholic Churches, the tin-domed church of Mshana was 
absorbed into the Russian Orthodox Church in 1946, on the orders of the 
dictator Josef Stalin, as part of his drive to eliminate Ukrainian nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
"Our church has never been Orthodox, and it never will be," Denko Koblitsky, a 
defiant Catholic farmer said recently, pointing with pride to the tiny, 
200-year-old building. 
</P>
<P>
In late February, the 1,000 Catholics of Mshana seized the church, becoming the 
latest in a wave of once-secret congregations of Catholic believers to occupy 
churches in the western Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
In Mshana, a farming village on the outskirts of Lvov, the Catholics drove out 
the Russian Orthodox priest, Father Igor Shvetz, and the church was sealed off 
by the police. Since then, the Catholic faithful have posted a 24-hour guard 
around the church to keep the Orthodox, who number about 200 in the village, 
from returning to claim the property. 
</P>
<P>
"We are freezing, but we won't give it back," said an elderly woman in peasant 
shawl, padded coat and felt boots, as she knelt on the grass near the front 
door and made the sign of the cross. As in the past, despite sub-freezing 
temperatures, the congregation continues to worship in the woods next to the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the western Ukraine, Catholics are emerging after nearly 50 years 
underground, years spent praying and attending weddings in apartments, 
cemeteries and even wheat fields, to find themselves still in bitter conflict 
with the Russian Orthodox Church. 
</P>
<P>
"The Orthodox won't give us back our churches," said Ivan Gel, a Catholic 
activist in Lvov. "They are being aggressive and offensive." 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Iriny, the head of the Orthodox Church in Lvov, acknowledged in an 
interview that "the situation is very tense between the two churches." He 
accused political organizations that are promoting Ukrainian nationalism of 
trying to co-opt the church issue and whip up hatred. 
</P>
<P>
"They claim that we seize Orthodox churches, but they were built by our 
grandfathers," Luba Dovga said. "They say Catholics seize Orthodox churches, 
but they are our churches." 
</P>
<P>
"We survived 50 years underground and they failed to break us," said Evgeny 
Kotsky, a 73-year-old Catholic monk who at the height of the oppression of 
Catholics was forced to work on a collective farm. "They took our vestments and 
burned our books. If that didn't stop us, nothing will." 
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian Catholics follow the Byzantine or Greek Catholic rite. There are 
few differences between the Ukrainian Catholic services and Russian Orthodox 
services; both use the Ukrainian and ancient Slav languages. The primary 
distinction is that the Catholic Church pays homage to the Pope, while the 
Orthodox Church follows its patriarch in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholics began coming out of their spiritual catacombs last year when it 
became clear that the authorities under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would 
not retaliate. A public Mass was conducted outside a soccer stadium and 300,000 
people attended. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of Gorbachev's historic visit to the Vatican last November, the 
Catholics of the Ukraine were told that they would be allowed to register as 
religious communities -- the first step on the way to full legalization of the 
church. But so far they have not been registered. 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Volodimir Sternyuk, 84, who presides over his Catholic flock from a 
one-room apartment without a telephone, complained that it may take many more 
months to get legal recognition and even longer to win back some of the 
churches that were seized in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
"Until we are registered and get back our property, we won't be satisfied," 
said Sternyuk, who spent five years in prison for his church activities. "We 
don't have a seminary, and without one the church will die soon." 
</P>
<P>
Sternyuk said the Catholic Church has just 400 priests to serve 3 million to 4 
million Catholics in the western Ukraine. In addition to the priests who went 
underground, the Catholics claim 250 Orthodox priests who have come over along 
with their congregations. The Orthodox maintain that the number of their 
priests who have embraced Catholicism is only about 70. 
</P>
<P>
A joint delegation from the Vatican and Moscow is due in Lvov soon in an effort 
to resolve the bitterness over church property. But the religious disagreements 
have endured since 1596, when the Ukrainian Catholics united with Rome. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a church-state problem," said Father Andriy Chirovsky, a Ukrainian 
Catholic priest from Chicago who is on extended leave in Lvov. "Asking a 
Ukrainian Catholic to pray at an Orthodox Church is like asking an Irish Roman 
Catholic to pray at an Anglican Church. The people equate the Orthodox Church 
with Stalin's rule." 
</P>
<P>
The first priest to cross the line was Father Yaroslav Chuknih, who was 
ordained as an Orthodox priest. Last October, Chuknih stunned the congregation 
at the Transfiguration Cathedral in central Lvov by announcing that he had 
accepted the authority of the Pope and was moving to the Catholic Church. The 
congregation quickly followed suit and seized the cathedral for Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
Father Andrei Gorak, one of the Orthodox priests at the cathedral, held a 
weeklong protest at the church after the takeover, but finally withdrew in 
defeat. Gorak said another Orthodox priest suffered a heart attack after the 
seizure and was hospitalized for two months. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Catholics have become resurgent in the Lvov area, the Orthodox Church 
has attempted to respond with reforms of its own. 
</P>
<P>
In a synod last month, it changed its name officially to the Ukrainian Orthodox 
Church and now has a say in its governance from Moscow. There is also an 
independent Orthodox Church, which recognizes neither Rome nor Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Iriny, the Orthodox prelate of Lvov, said that 80% of the people are 
still Orthodox and that Catholic services are sparsely attended. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the reverse was true, with Catholics packed so tightly into Sunday 
morning Masses that they overflow into the streets. A man who had fainted at 
the start of one recent Mass was held erect for the entire 2 1/2-hour service 
by the press of the crowd. Only when the worshipers began moving out of the 
Transfiguration Cathedral did he collapse. 
</P>
<P>
At St. Onuphriy's church in Lvov, nearly 400 years old, thousands pressed into 
the historic building on a recent Sunday to hear their pastor, Father Anthony 
Masuk, denounce the Orthodox and warn that the baptisms and weddings of the 
last 44 years were invalid, a move that put him at odds with his hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was permissible to pray in an Orthodox Church we would not have endured 
all that we have endured," said Masuk.

L.A. CATHOLIC ARCHDIOCESE PROJECTS $8-MILLION DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The administrative arm of the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese has had a 
moratorium on hiring and new programs for the last eight months and faces a 
budget deficit of up to $8 million by June, according to its chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
The projected shortfall has been caused primarily by increased subsidies to 
inner-city parishes and schools, as well as sharply rising health insurance 
costs, Jose Debasa said in an interview this week. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing more than we can afford to do," said Debasa, who oversees yearly 
expenses of $111 million for the chancery, as the archdiocesan central offices 
are called. But he said the deficit could be smaller, depending on other 
sources of income. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure comes on the heels of the release this month of a more upbeat 
financial report for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 1989. A church 
spokesman said at the time that "the financial condition of the archdiocese is 
healthy, but . . . could be much better." (In addition to the chancery, that 
report covered another $200 million handled independently by parishes and 
parish-run schools.) 
</P>
<P>
The most troubling trend in the archdiocese-wide report for fiscal 1989, Debasa 
said, was that expenses of $301 million represented an increase of 4.2% from 
the previous year while income rose less than 0.5%, to $325 million. At the 
same time, there was a 10% rise in contributions from parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
If more parishes and schools cannot make ends meet, more of them will be 
seeking financial aid from the chancery budget, Debasa said. 
</P>
<P>
This year is the first time that the chancery has imposed a budget cutback or 
spending freeze on its departments. Debasa said this indicates that financial 
problems, while not grave, are growing. 
</P>
<P>
"We are holding down expenses but not getting the income we should, considering 
the size and importance of this archdiocese," he said. About 300 people are 
employed in the chancery. Debasa said the only major exception to the freeze on 
new programs was the recent approval of an expansion of the Tidings, the 
archdiocesan newspaper, including creation of a Spanish-language paper. 
</P>
<P>
A 29% rise in medical and health insurance costs last September prompted Debasa 
and other chancery officers to ask each department to cut back 16% in their 
expected spending for the year ending June 30, 1990. The departments achieved 
only a 13% reduction because health costs increased an additional 12% on Jan. 
1, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The archdiocese, the most populous in the country with 3.4 million Catholics in 
285 parishes, provides financial subsidies to 51 inner-city parishes. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came here four years ago we gave a little more than $3 million to help 
inner-city parishes. Today that subsidy has doubled," Debasa said. Among the 
biggest expenses are improved teacher salaries, insurance, earthquake code 
compliance and rehabilitating older buildings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Debasa estimated that the chancery deficit by the end of June will be between 
$5 million and $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't have the cash, we have to go to our reserves," he said. However, 
he added, a deficit is not certain if market investments or other sources of 
revenue bring more than expected. 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Roger M. Mahony has expanded the chancery bureaucracy manyfold since 
succeeding Cardinal Timothy Manning in 1985 as archbishop of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We've grown awfully large very fast," Debasa said. The freeze on hiring and 
new programs will continue until final reports from consultants analyzing what 
services might be trimmed are in place, he said.

O.C.'S MATER DEI HIGH HAS BIG REPUTATION, EVEN BIGGER AMBITION

<TEXT>
<P>
Tuition is $3,200 a year. It takes high entrance exam scores to get in, 
although family connections help. Some years, as many as 900 qualified 
applicants have been turned away. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic teams, supported by enthusiastic, generous alumni, have national 
reputations. Baseball and basketball teams have been ranked No. 1 in the 
nation. Despite complaints about recruiting violations, the athletic department 
never has received more than a one-year, wrist-slap probation. 
</P>
<P>
The school's top administrator has hired professional fund-raisers and says he 
is "very confident" about raising $15 million for new buildings and an 
endowment fund. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a medium-size college. 
</P>
<P>
But this is a high school -- Mater Dei in Santa Ana. It is one of the biggest 
Catholic secondary schools in the nation and the biggest west of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
At age 40, the 18-acre campus is bursting with more than 2,100 boys and girls. 
</P>
<P>
It is also bursting its buttons at the moment over its basketball team, which 
is playing tonight in Oakland for the state championship, to the surprise of 
hardly anyone. The team has won the state title before -- as recently as 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps as remarkable, about 3,000 Mater Dei rooters are expected to make the 
450-mile trip to see the game. In a sample of one Mater Dei classroom this 
week, 19 of 22 students said they would attend. 
</P>
<P>
"Sports are put on a pedestal here. Everything is centered around sports," said 
Chris Heiser, a 16-year-old student. 
</P>
<P>
And who's responsible for that? "We are," answered the class, almost in unison. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to get involved here than at a lot of other schools," Becky 
Berardini, 17, said. "Mater Dei is really competitive. The desire to succeed is 
really something that keeps you going. It just keeps you motivated." 
</P>
<P>
School officials say the quality and enthusiasm of their students is evident in 
areas other than athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Honors-class enrollment tops 1,200. About 95% of the graduating seniors go 
directly to universities and to four- and two-year colleges. Mater Dei students 
consistently score higher than average on the SAT college entrance exams. Last 
year the school's combined average score was 1,010 points, compared to 906 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
University of California admissions director Ed Apodaca said Mater Dei is a 
familiar name in his office. The campus is one of the state's major sources of 
UC students, "probably in the top 10%" statewide. "They should be very proud of 
the number of students they send us," Apodaca said. 
</P>
<P>
They are, and they do it while providing fewer teachers per student than the 
typical Orange County public high school. At Mater Dei, there is on the average 
of one teacher for each 35 students. By contrast, in Fullerton and Huntington 
Beach high schools, the average is about one to 28. 
</P>
<P>
"Our ratio might be a little higher, but the quality of our students and 
teachers kind of compensates," said Mater Dei's principal, Father John B. 
Weling. 
</P>
<P>
Public school educators say the reason for Mater Dei's high academic 
performance is the same as for its athletic superiority: The school can pick 
and choose its students from all of Orange County because, unlike public 
schools, it is not restricted by residency requirements. A scholar from La 
Habra or an athlete from San Clemente need not move to Santa Ana to attend 
Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of academics, Mater Dei selects the cream of college-bound students 
whose families can afford the substantial tuition. The school promises parents 
a "holistic" education for their children stressing not only academic 
instruction but spiritual training and strict discipline. 
</P>
<P>
Besides taking the usual college-prep curriculum, Mater Dei students must take 
40 units of religious studies spread throughout their four high school years 
and perform at least 80 hours of "community service," such as helping at 
hospitals and visiting the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Four deans are assigned full time to discipline and spend much of it enforcing 
a strict and detailed dress code. The code's small type covers most of two 
pages in the student handbook, specifying dress for virtually every occasion 
from classroom to football games to banquets to the prom. 
</P>
<P>
The aim is clearly stated: to avoid "exaggerated or faddish" appearances that 
"draw unfavorable attention to the wearer." Students are reminded that 
"attending Mater Dei is a privilege." 
</P>
<P>
The overall result has been a bright, obedient student body and a corps of 
success-oriented parents who have the means and desire to help with the 
hundreds of extras, like bus fare for the debate team or sheet music for the 
choir. 
</P>
<P>
Or support for winning teams. Mater Dei can give breaks to great quarterbacks, 
forwards and pitchers, attracting them from both Catholic and public schools 
with the promise of high-profile athletic programs sure to attract college 
scouts. In basketball alone, 19 Mater Dei players have gone directly to major 
college teams in the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
A few scholarships are available to help promising students who could not 
otherwise enroll. 
</P>
<P>
These attractions have proved to be substantial. In 1984, for example, when the 
Mater Dei Monarchs were arguably the best basketball team in Orange County 
history, four of the five starters were not Catholic and came from as far away 
as Cerritos. In 1987, a quarterback from Corona del Mar High School transferred 
to Mater Dei, and interscholastic sports authorities put Mater Dei on one 
year's probation for alleged recruiting irregularities -- a misunderstanding, 
according to Weling. 
</P>
<P>
Criticism from rival basketball coaches was unusually harsh and open in the mid 
'80s, when Mater Dei Coach (and now also athletic director) Gary McKnight had 
some of the best teams ever and set them to running up lopsided scores of 
103-46, 91-37 and 92-31. 
</P>
<P>
Some charged McKnight cared only about his team's ranking in polls. An athletic 
director at a Los Angeles Catholic high school published a letter questioning 
McKnight's "responsibility as a Christian educator. 
</P>
<P>
"After all," wrote Bob Fish of Cathedral High School, "where is the compassion 
for the other team?" 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, McKnight said his youth (he was in his late 20s) had made 
him overzealous. He had mellowed since then, he said. On the other hand, the 
enthusiasm of and for his teams has hardly abated. 
</P>
<P>
The intensity of students and boosters is remarkable for the high school level. 
An extraordinarily large pep squad, sometime practicing longer hours than 
sports teams, has won national championships. They and rooters travel great 
distances for away games, throw tailgate parties, buy and wear "Monarch Mania" 
T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Those willing to write checks as well as cheer have formed the Quarterback 
Club. Consequently, players have the best of equipment and uniforms, and the 
baseball field got the first electronic scoreboard on an Orange County high 
school diamond, a gift of alumnus and then-New York Yankees shortstop Bobby 
Meacham. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like a college situation," McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
Game crowds are so large and the campus so cramped, however, that Mater Dei 
plays few of its home games at home. Virtually all of the school's departments 
are aching for space. Mater Dei officials are hoping that the past generosity 
of sports boosters signals smooth sailing for a building-fund campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's going to hurt -- put it that way," Weling said. 
</P>
<P>
Opened in 1950 as part of the Southern California postwar boom in Catholic 
education, Mater Dei was designed for a student enrollment of only about 800. 
</P>
<P>
It was the only coeducational Catholic high school in Orange County, and 
applications soon began to rise. The enrollment began its steep climb in 1956 
and by 1964 had jumped to 1,800. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei was refusing as many as 900 applicants each year until 1987, when the 
county's second Catholic co-ed high school, Santa Margarita, opened in Rancho 
Santa Margarita and relieved some of the pressure. With an enrollment holding 
at about 2,100, Mater Dei now turns away about 200 applicants a year. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a former bank building was acquired and temporary classrooms 
were brought in. More affluent students meant more cars to park. Students' cars 
line neighborhood streets and cover the outdoors basketball courts, which must 
be cleared by the time ROTC drill begins. 
</P>
<P>
There are two lunch periods so that only 1,000 students at a time cram the 
"lunchroom," merely row after row of outdoor benches. If it's raining, the 
diners take over the gym. 
</P>
<P>
Fund raising to relieve Mater Dei's crowding was postponed while the diocese 
concentrated on financing the new Santa Margarita campus. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first campaign to build a new Catholic school in Orange County since 
the '40s and the first new Catholic high school in the nation in a decade. 
Fund-raisers received a pleasant surprise. Not only did they raise the required 
$26 million, but the three largest contributions, all more than $1 million, 
came from non-Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Santa Margarita's subsequent enrollment policies have 
permitted an unusually high non-Catholic enrollment -- about 25%. Mater Dei's 
is only about 5%, but consultants say that could change if studies show it 
would be a fund-raising advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"Successful fund raising promotes more successful fund raising," said Father 
Michael Harris, Santa Margarita's principal and former principal at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Weling -- a Santa Ana native and former Mater Dei student, teacher and freshman 
football coach -- has been principal of Mater Dei for three years. Nearly half 
the time has been spent trying to figure a solution to the space problem. 
</P>
<P>
Weling said some have suggested moving the campus at Edinger Avenue and Bristol 
Street because the neighborhood has become increasingly poorer and run-down. 
But the school's tradition and his fondness for his hometown Santa Ana make him 
want to keep the school where it always has been, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if about eight more acres cannot be obtained, staying there would be 
very difficult, Weling said. The best hope would be obtaining the land as part 
of possible city-sponsored redevelopment of the area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the campus might be moved to somewhere close by -- preferably within 
Santa Ana but perhaps in the South Coast Plaza area, Huntington Beach or 
Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
"We have casually looked around," Weling said. "Of course, it's up to the 
bishop to decide." 
</P>
<P>
The most telling factor, however, is bound to be money. Weling says he is new 
to fund raising, but beginning next fall he will dive into it as the school's 
new president. Someone else will be hired to succeed him as principal, perhaps 
a lay person -- which would be a first for the school. 
</P>
<P>
Already at work is the Robert B. Sharp Co. of Santa Ana, the fund-raising 
consultants for the Santa Margarita High School project. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Sharp said his firm will interview the sort of people who make such 
donations to gauge the feasibility of Mater Dei's hopes. Surprisingly, Sharp 
said he doesn't consider the athletic department's fund raising and victory 
record much of an asset. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, strong (athletics) programs really only yield 
athletics-fund giving. They have very little effect on building-fund programs," 
Sharp said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, we're seeing some skepticism from major donors when it comes to 
putting big bucks in athletic programs if some money won't be available to the 
school in general," he said. "There is a real concern now over faculty salaries 
in Catholic schools," which at Mater Dei average $6,000 to $10,000 a year below 
public school levels. Not surprising, part of the fund-raising goal includes 
endowment funds to increase teacher salaries, according to Weling. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets down to a belief in the ideals and the benefits the institution seeks 
to provide," Sharp said. "Every institution is a little bit different. We hope 
to find that at Mater Dei the alumni have a tremendous love for it, respect for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Weling is optimistic. "After 40 years, we have a well-established alumni . . . 
," he said. "We're just hoping that corporations will help us too."

The newspaper quoted officials as saying they expect it will take three years 
to bring the rats -- about 2 million of them -- under control. Starting next 
week, four "commando groups" will stalk the sewage system armed with rat

PIPE BOMB ENDANGERS SCHOOL'S SWIM TEAM BUT FAILS TO EXPLODE

Clay Kaytis was swimming laps with the rest of the Orange High School swim team 
early Friday morning when he noticed a small, dark object on the bottom of the 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
Curious, the 16-year-old swam down to examine the object. 
</P>
<P>
What he brought to the surface was a container wrapped in black electrician's 
tape with a red fuse. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like a bomb," Kaytis said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Kaytis carried it to his coach, Charles Fisher, who told somebody to call the 
police, then took the device to an isolated spot in the student parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 90 minutes, surrounding streets were closed and nearby classes 
canceled as the Sheriff's Department bomb squad worked to defuse what deputies 
called a "very lethal explosive." 
</P>
<P>
The fuse had been lit, authorities said, but for some reason it did not 
explode, even though it was equipped to detonate in the water. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever you have a pipe bomb, and you don't know who made it, the quality of 
it is suspect," Orange Police Sgt. Art Romo said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said Kaytis and Fisher had placed themselves "in great danger" by 
handling the device. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Sgt. Charles Stumph, supervisor of the bomb squad, said his unit has 
gone out on more than 85 bomb calls so far this year, 22 of which involved 
homemade bombs. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been very active lately," he said, adding that most pipe bombs they 
encounter are traced to teen-agers. "It seems that most of these kids are 
experimenting." 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 31, a student at Loara High School in Anaheim found a pipe bomb as he 
was walking across the school's football field. 
</P>
<P>
Pipe bombs are lethal because fragments from the pipes shoot through the air 
"faster than a bullet," Stumph said. 
</P>
<P>
Kaytis, who was dubbed a hero by several classmates, admitted that he was a 
little shaken up after he learned that the object was a real bomb. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have lost an arm or something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials and police said they have no idea who put the bomb in the 
pool. "It's hard to understand who would want to do a thing like this," said 
Shirley Fox, Orange High's principal.

NEW LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST ROAD PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of a residents group this week filed a new lawsuit in an ongoing 
attempt to stop city road-widening projects. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Save Our Bastanchury group filed suit Thursday in Superior Court 
to halt city officials from doing work on a pair of street improvement projects 
to allow the group time to qualify an initiative for the city ballot 
restricting such projects. The group contends that widening Bastanchury Road 
and making a series of improvements to Euclid Street will increase congestion 
and noise beyond acceptable limits. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton is in the final funding stage for the Euclid project and in the midst 
of purchasing right-of-way property for the Bastanchury project, said Hugh 
Berry, the city's director of Engineering and Community Development. 
</P>
<P>
In order to qualify for federal and county funding to help pay for road 
programs, the city must initiate right-of-way purchases for the Bastanchury 
project by June and award the construction contracts for the Euclid project by 
September. But Berry said those deadlines are usually extended if legal action 
is taken to delay the projects. 
</P>
<P>
Mary B. Homme and John D. Bastian, leaders of the group who filed the suit 
Thursday, formed Save Our Bastanchury last year. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the group began the steps needed to qualify a measure for the 
ballot that would restrict road improvements if the resulting traffic created 
noise above the limits outlined in the city's general plan. 
</P>
<P>
But the necessary signature drive stalled before it began when the group 
challenged the city attorney's summary of the proposed ballot measure. Homme 
and Bastian said the summary was biased and filed suit to force the city 
attorney to rewrite it. A hearing on that request is scheduled for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
If the group's latest suit succeeds, it would put the Bastanchury and Euclid 
projects on hold until the group's initiative effort is complete, probably 
until after the November election. TOM McQUEENEY

Henry Hays never imagined that he would meet foreign dignitaries, address 
lawmakers and travel halfway around the world when he agreed earlier this year 
to help a few of his classmates with a famine relief fund-raiser at University 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
But there the 18-year-old Hays stood Friday at a special assembly at the 
school, embracing an important African politician and thinking about his 
upcoming trip to Washington and Africa where he will see how the $25,000 his 
classmates raised for famine relief will be used.

Hays and five other University High students are scheduled to make the journey 
to Senegal and Mali later this month. On Friday, a member of Mali's ruling 
National Council made a detour on an American fact-finding mission to meet the 
students who offered help to his poverty-stricken country. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just stunned about the whole thing," said Hays, a senior and manager of 
the school basketball team. "I can't believe I'm really going to another 
continent -- somewhere different from Irvine. When I got involved, I wanted to 
make a difference in people's lives. . . . Now I'm actually going to be able to 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
The visit by Bajan Ag Hamatou, the chief of one of Mali's largest tribes, 
capped a monthlong fund-raising drive on the campus. Students were asked to 
donate their lunch money once a week during February and to get sponsors to do 
the same. Hays was one of the top money raisers, collecting $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Hamatou, who is in the United States to examine different forms of government, 
spoke at an assembly of more than 800 University students, thanking the group 
for its help in feeding his people. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been victimized by nature," he said through an interpreter. "We lost 
our animals and way of living because of the drought. You have helped us." 
</P>
<P>
Hamatou, clad in a brown cloth head cover and gray robe, stressed the 
difference between Mali -- which has an illiteracy rate of 90% -- and Irvine, 
where most of the student who cheered him after his address wore trendy summer 
clothes and expensive athletic shoes. 
</P>
<P>
However, he also noted that his village and the high school have roughly the 
same populations, and that the citizens of Mali appreciate the students' 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"My people like to see (aid) that comes from people, not from government to 
government," he said. "It makes them feel like they can go on with their lives 
-- like other people." 
</P>
<P>
Hays, for one, was impressed by the Malian leader, who received loud applause 
often during the assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I was a little intimidated by the man. He is very powerful," said 
Hays. "But he is a very congenial and intelligent man." 
</P>
<P>
The first-of-its-kind famine relief program was sponsored by the Irvine-based 
U.S. Students Against World Hunger. Officials hope to bring the fund-raiser to 
other schools around Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The students will leave Southern California on March 28, traveling first to 
Washington to meet with members of Congress working on world hunger legislation 
before moving on to Africa for an eight-day visit. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't put into words how excited I am about going," said Kenya Johnson, 
another student who will make the trip. "I don't have any thoughts in my mind 
(about Africa). I just want to do all I can when I get there." SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;

<P>
VETERANS POST FACES CLOSURE BY THE CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Planning Commission has begun proceedings to close the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars Post 8954 on Homewood Avenue because the organization has not solved a 
chronic parking problem. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member commission was legally bound to take action to get the group's 
conditional use permit revoked after city officials found that the post had 
failed to create more parking, as required by the permit. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, several commissioners said they do not favor forcing the veterans 
to leave the hall. A hearing is scheduled next month to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't support revocation at this time," Commissioner William Kenney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's action follows more than a year of disagreements between the city 
and the post. In September, in response to complaints by neighbors living near 
the hall, the City Council upheld a commission decision barring the veterans 
from renting the facility in the 6400 block of Homewood to outside groups. 
</P>
<P>
The hall had been used for weddings and large gatherings that residents had 
complained were often too noisy. They also complained that party-goers littered 
the neighborhood and that the gatherings sometimes turned violent. 
</P>
<P>
The last straw, many residents said, came last March, when gunshots were fired 
in front of the lodge during a party. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the council limited the hours when the hall could be open and 
required the VFW Post to provide parking for patrons. Officials with the 
veterans' group say they have complied with the restrictions, except for 
providing more parking. 
</P>
<P>
But Dan Curtis, a member of the group, said attempts have been made to solve 
the parking shortage. A vacant lot across from the hall, however, was sold 
before the post could acquire it, leaving no new parking alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Since the council restricted use of the hall, the post has offered the 
structure for sale. Members contend that without rental income they will be 
forced to move. Rentals to outside groups generated about $9,000 in income 
annually, Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
To make ends meet, the 500-member post has done away with many charitable 
activities and trimmed such expenses as utilities, Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that two bidders are interested in buying the hall, but that the 
veterans have been unable to find affordable site. LYNDA NATALI

OFF-DUTY OFFICER KILLS MAN AT DISCO;

<P>
An off-duty Los Angeles police officer working as a security guard at a night 
club shot and killed a Santa Ana man early Friday during a parking lot brawl, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 2 a.m. incident erupted when seven people began fighting outside the 
Carnivale Club at the Orange Fair Mall. Gunshots were heard by two security 
guards who were sitting in a car in the parking area on South Lemon Street, Los 
Angeles Police Sgt. Elmer Pellegrino said. Both guards are LAPD officers. 
</P>
<P>
Pellegrino said that Eric Parga, 22, was killed after he allegedly fired a 
.22-caliber, semiautomatic pistol at a crowd of people who were fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Officers Rancy Garcia, 34, and David Navarro, 32, jumped out of their car when 
they saw Parga with the gun, Pellegrino said, and Garcia ordered Parga to drop 
his weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"Parga ignored his commands, pointed the weapon toward the group and fired 
three rounds," Pellegrino said. Garcia then fired, hitting Parga. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton police offered a similar version of events. But Fullerton Sgt. Neal 
Baldwin said the guards were coming out of the Carnivale Club when they saw 
Parga and were not sitting in a car. 
</P>
<P>
Parga died shortly after being taken to Anaheim Memorial Hospital with a bullet 
wound in the chest, a hospital official said. 
</P>
<P>
Two witnesses to the shooting, Parga's brother, Brian Parga, 26, and a friend, 
Raymond Arzola, 20, insisted that Parga was unarmed and that he was shot in the 
back while running toward the car of a friend who had driven them to the disco. 
They said they did not hear a warning before the shots were fired by the 
off-duty officers. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone yelled that the police were coming, so I pushed Eric to try to get him 
away (from the fight)," Arzola said. "We were both running side by side, and I 
thought that he tripped. Then I looked down, and my pants were covered with 
blood." 
</P>
<P>
Both Arzola and Brian Parga confirmed that they heard gunshots before the 
off-duty officers arrived. They said, however, that the shots were not fired by 
anyone in their group of five, nor did they appear to be fired by the two men 
with whom they were fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin said the people involved in the fight were interviewed by investigators 
and released. The case is being investigated by Fullerton police, the district 
attorney's officer-involved shooting team and the LAPD robbery-homicide 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia and Navarro have been with the LAPD for 10 and four years, respectively, 
Pellegrino said.

NOISY AMPHITHEATER HEARS FROM LAWYERS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frustrated that earlier court action has brought them no peace, neighbors who 
have had an earful of noise from Costa Mesa's Pacific Amphitheater announced 
Friday that they have filed a new flurry of lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Santa Ana, residents said they are fed up with the pace 
of settlement talks in a 6-year-old lawsuit against the 18,500-seat 
amphitheater by Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa and resident Laurie Lusk, so 
they decided to venture into the courts themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Their lawyer, Richard L. Spix, who also represents Lusk and Concerned Citizens 
in Superior Court, chose Municipal Court for the latest round of complaints 
because he thinks he can get results faster there. On Wednesday and Thursday in 
Municipal Court in Newport Beach, he filed about 15 complaints on behalf of 35 
amphitheater neighbors. Each plaintiff seeks $25,000 in damages -- the most 
someone may seek in Municipal Court -- for nuisance and emotional distress from 
the noise. 
</P>
<P>
Spix said he decided to file the new actions to get monetary compensation for 
the neighbors because the Superior Court suit sought only a noise remedy. Spix 
also said he hopes to make amphitheater operators realize they can reduce the 
noise more cheaply than they can fend off the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said they were launched into action by a Tom Petty performance on 
March 3, the opening act of the amphitheater's 1990 concert season. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire performance was loud, a heavy beat," said Norman Snow, who lives 
about a half-mile from the stage. "It invades the house. There's no peace." 
</P>
<P>
Snow, 67, said he and the other neighbors have watched the Concerned Citizens' 
lawsuit wind its way through the courts for six years and have given up hope 
that it will bring them the quiet they crave. 
</P>
<P>
Since the lawsuit was filed, a revised amplification system and sound barriers 
have reduced the decibel level somewhat. But neighbors contend it still 
violates county limits and they want further reductions. Superior Court Judge 
Richard J. Beacom has been holding settlement talks to work out an agreement, 
but none has been reached yet. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge has taken no action to control the noise, and in the meantime we get 
nailed," said Rusty Lusk, Laurie Lusk's husband and a plaintiff in one of the 
Municipal Court complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Papiano, an attorney for Ned West Inc., the amphitheater's builder and 
owner, said the new complaints are not a productive way to lower the noise at 
the arena. He said it takes time to arrange and rearrange the sound barriers 
and amplification system to find the right solution to all the affected areas 
of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really all being done in a reasonable fashion," he said. "It's not one of 
those things that you can just say, 'Do it,' and it's done. If it were, it 
would be done by now."

ORBIT INSTRUMENT TO CLOSE CYPRESS PLANT, CUT 40 JOBS

Orbit Instrument Corp. of California, a small defense electronics firm, said 
Friday it will shut down its production plant here in May, resulting in the 
loss of 40 jobs, because of declining federal defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing employees will be laid off, and the operation will be 
consolidated with the main Orbit Instrument plant and corporate headquarters in 
Long Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The California subsidiary will retain a small sales and engineering office in 
Cypress, but with fewer than the current seven employees, said Matthew Binder, 
Orbit's vice president for finance. 
</P>
<P>
Orbit reported $50 million in revenue for fiscal 1989, ended June 30, and $30 
million in sales for the first half of fiscal '90. It opened the Cypress 
manufacturing plant in 1981 during the defense spending boom that followed 
Ronald Reagan's inauguration as President. 
</P>
<P>
Binder said the subsidiary, which never had more than 50 employees, was created 
to give Orbit a presence in Southern California, where so many prime defense 
contractors are. But with defense spending on the decline in recent years and 
with the likelihood that reductions will continue because of the easing of 
East-West tensions, Orbit officials decided "to maximize profit by keeping all 
the manufacturing in one place," Binder said. 
</P>
<P>
The same kind of decisions are being made daily at other defense plants 
throughout the nation, and analysts have been predicting a wave of 
consolidations, plant closures and layoffs as the industry adjusts to cuts in 
defense programs. 
</P>
<P>
Binder said that Orbit, like many others, began diversifying several years ago 
to reduce its dependence on defense work, which now accounts for about 35% of 
annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Orbit Instrument, which has 175 employees in New York, and the 
Orbit Instrument of California subsidiary, the company owns Orbit Semiconductor 
in Sunnyvale, a 175-employee manufacturer of customized semiconductors. It also 
owns USA Classic, which has 300 employees at plants in Tennessee and Alabama 
making men's and boys' sports clothing.

NATIONAL LUMBER BEGINS TALKS ON RESTRUCTURING; 
</P>
<P>
BUILDING SUPPLIES: INCREASED COMPETITION AND A SLOWDOWN IN THE LOCAL HOUSING 
AND HOME-REPAIR MARKETS HAVE HURT SALES.

Citing reduced sales and cash flow difficulties, National Lumber &amp; Supply 
Inc. said Friday that it has initiated talks with its principal secured lender 
to restructure the company's debt. 
</P>
<P>
The company also said it has called a March 26 meeting with its major suppliers 
to discuss the struggling home-improvement retailer's attempts to reorganize. 
The meeting is apparently designed to quell supplier's concerns about the 
firm's financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
"We are conferring with our principal secured lender and have called a meeting 
with suppliers to work cooperatively in restructuring the company's debt," said 
a statement by Melvin Jaffee, president and chief executive officer of National 
Lumber. 
</P>
<P>
The debt discussions and supplier meeting come as National Lumber is trying to 
develop a plan to improve operations. The company recently hired an investment 
banker, Wedbush Morgan Securities, to help it raise money for the 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Fidelcor Business Credit Corp. of Century City, the principal secured lender to 
National Lumber, confirmed that restructuring talks are under way. The amount 
involved could not be determined. 
</P>
<P>
A top Fidelcor official said that the lender is open to proposals that might 
solve National Lumber's debt troubles and that National Lumber is not in danger 
of defaulting on loans. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffee said increased competition and a slowdown in the local housing and 
home-repair markets have hurt sales and "significantly decreased" cash flow, 
which affects the company's ability to pay its bills for ongoing operations. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which operates 21 do-it-yourself hardware stores in Southern 
California, has fared poorly in recent years as it faced increasing competition 
from larger chains, including Home Depot and HomeClub. 
</P>
<P>
National Lumber lost $4.4 million on sales of $108 million in the three 
quarters ended Oct. 31. It lost $2.3 million on sales of $117 million in the 
same period in the previous year. It has not yet announced fiscal 1990 results. 
The firm lost $4.6 million in fiscal 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The losses have raised concerns among the firm's suppliers, some of whom have 
reportedly been reluctant to make shipments without cash-on-delivery payments. 
A company spokesman said about 100 supplier representatives are expected to 
attend the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Kilpatrick, president of Newport Securities, said the meeting with 
suppliers is probably designed to quiet the fears of some of the company's 
important creditors. He said the acknowledgement of cash flow problems is 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a very dangerous cycle, if you can't pay your suppliers on time," 
Kilpatrick said. "They become less eager to ship you goods. You can't make a 
profit if you don't have product in the store." 
</P>
<P>
Jaffee said the company has already taken several steps to reduce costs. He 
noted that the company has closed its central warehouse -- a move projected to 
save $3 million a year -- and has started a self-insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
"These actions have already resulted in significant expense reductions," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffee had previously said the firm was renovating its stores to accommodate 
new displays for more upscale products, and offering in-home sales and 
installation of doors, windows and kitchen products. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffee said in late February that these and other steps should help the firm 
return to profitability by the end of July. The company was founded by his 
father, Sol, in 1942.

DEAL COMPLETED TO ESTABLISH CARL'S JR. IN 9 PACIFIC NATIONS

As expected, Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. announced Friday it signed a 
licensing agreement with a Malaysian partner to bring the Famous Star hamburger 
and the other offerings of its Carl's Jr. restaurants to nine Pacific Rim 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher signed the deal with MBf International, a financial services company 
based in Kuala Lumpur. 
</P>
<P>
MBf plans to open a Carl's Jr. restaurant in Malaysia next year and others 
later in Singapore, Australia and Hong Kong. The company also hopes to expand 
the fast-food chain into Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan and New 
Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Kishi, Karcher's vice president for international operations, said that 
MBf will put up the money for the project and pay royalties to Karcher. 
Anaheim-based Karcher will lend the Carl Jr.'s name, products, know-how and 
marketing expertise to the venture. 
</P>
<P>
As a licensee, Kishi said, MBf will have greater flexibility in developing new 
products than the 550 company- or franchise-owned Carl's Jr. restaurants in 
California, Arizona, Nevada and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
That feature could prove important in markets such as Malaysia, a predominantly 
Muslim nation where pork is generally not eaten. Given such local tastes, he 
said the chain's "western bacon cheeseburger" may be reformulated for the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"We may get the product with same taste but without the pork bacon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Kishi noted, the Pacific market has such all-American favorites as 
McDonald's, Wendy's and White Castle. He added, however, that Carl's Jr. 
restaurants should be successful with a more upscale line of fast-food that 
will cater to the growing affluence of Pacific Rim nations. 
</P>
<P>
The deal with MBf marks Karcher's second move into the Far East. In 1988, 
Karcher teamed up with Friendly Corp. of Osaka, Japan, to bring Carl's Jr. to 
that nation.

VALUE OF TEACHING DEAF TO SPEAK STILL DEBATED;

The debate over whether to teach deaf children how to speak is unlikely to 
wane, educators say, despite a study showing that reading scores were strongly 
higher for those able to speak. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very emotional controversy," said Jean Moog, principal of Central 
Institute for the Deaf, where the federally funded study was done in 1988. "I 
think what we're trying to do is bring some rationale to the topic." 
</P>
<P>
In the study of 100 profoundly deaf 16- and 17-year-old students who had been 
taught speech, reading scores were five grade levels higher than the 
third-grade nationwide average for profoundly deaf students. Thirty of the 100 
read at or above the 10th-grade level, said Ann Geers, who led the research. 
</P>
<P>
"That means they were functioning for all practical purposes like 
normal-hearing adolescents, which is rather outstanding considering the 
severity of their deafness," Geers said. 
</P>
<P>
Profoundly deaf people, even with the most powerful hearing aids, cannot 
understand speech without special training, though they may hear some sounds. 
</P>
<P>
The report has been well-received by supporters of teaching the deaf to speak, 
but Moog said those who favor total communication, a combination of speech and 
sign language used in 90% of the schools, are less enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
The hit movie "Children of a Lesser God" dealt with the moral question of 
whether the deaf should be integrated, sometimes against their will, into the 
speaking world. Sign language is easier to teach than speech, but may be of 
little or no use except among other deaf people. 
</P>
<P>
According to Helen Bayer, coordinator of the St. Louis County Special School 
District deaf education program, choosing between the two extremes and a myriad 
of choices between depends on factors such as intelligence, other learning 
disabilities and family support. 
</P>
<P>
"I've enjoyed great success with some profoundly deaf students in teaching them 
to talk, and I've interacted with others where it was a very painful experience 
in which their self-confidence was destroyed," Bayer said. 
</P>
<P>
In the typical total communication program, research has shown that students 
depend too much on sign language, Moog said. "They make noises, they vocalize, 
but speech is not intelligible without the signs." 
</P>
<P>
Deaf children in total communications programs also don't read as well because 
they aren't given intensive instruction in speech and language, Geers said. If 
deaf students are to reach their full potential, they must be taught to speak 
at an early age, before signing is learned, she said. 
</P>
<P>
To participate in the study, teen-agers had to have been profoundly deaf before 
they learned language. They had to have been educated in an oral setting only 
and to have a normal IQ with no significant educational handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
In reading ability, Moog said, "what appeared to make the most difference was 
their facility with English, the extent to which they mastered vocabulary, 
understood syntactic structure and how to form complex sentences, how to write 
them, how to speak them and how to understand them when they were spoken." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 20,000 profoundly deaf people under age 21 in the United States, only 
about 10% are taught in oral communication programs that emphasize the limited 
hearing they have, lip-reading and speaking. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want deaf children to talk, it takes a lot of work on speech," Moog 
said. On average, children in a total communication program receive two or 
three half-hour speech lessons a week and end up using mostly sign language. 
</P>
<P>
"The profound effect will come within the next 10 years when all deaf children 
being educated in total communication programs are not talking," she said. 
"There will be an entire generation of deaf children who will be angry that 
they were not given the instruction to talk." 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of total communication say that teaching speech takes more time and 
effort and that many preschool children in oral-only programs are unable to 
communicate in any form for a few years. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always referred to it as a religious war," Bayer said. "It's sort of like 
finding passages in the Bible that will support your position."

RETIREES VOLUNTEERING TO ASSIST THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES

Pierre le Boulanger, 60, a retired farmer from Brittany, had never left France 
before he went to Cameroon to help an investor set up a poultry farm. Annick 
Marie, 58, a former secretary, stayed a year in Togo teaching a young secretary 
in a Christian diocese. 
</P>
<P>
They could have stayed home watching TV or playing with their grandchildren. 
Instead, like about 2,000 other retirees in France, they volunteered to share 
time and knowledge with Third World countries through a private nonprofit 
association of retired people dedicated to promoting development and 
cooperation between the West and developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest volunteer in the group known as AGIR is 88, the youngest 43. The 
group says retired craftsmen, bankers, technicians, nurses, teachers, 
engineers, farmers and company managers have put in a total of 30,000 workdays 
in the Third World since the group was created in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers are performing such tasks as conducting a study on the 
reorganization of the National Development Bank of Mali, taking care of 
disabled and abandoned children in Haiti and assisting a Tuareg tribe of nomads 
begin a settled agricultural life. 
</P>
<P>
"We are retired people who want to live more wisely than just playing Petanque 
or dealing out cards," says the group's president, Jean Petithory, 55. "What we 
are doing may just be a drop in the ocean -- sometimes you have to use a 
magnifying glass to notice it -- but several drops dispersed all over the 
world, combined with the action of other non-governmental organizations, can 
make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
But the study of the National Development Bank of Mali was not a drop in the 
ocean, development experts say. The volunteers were contacted by the World 
Bank, which otherwise would have hired expensive specialists. The team has 
spent more than two years rethinking an institution responsible for 80% of the 
government loans to Malian companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the National Development Bank closed, the Malian economy was stalling," 
said Robert le Duhan, 67, a former financial public administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty volunteers went to Mali, among them six financial specialists who worked 
through the end of last year. Another project sent 15 professors to Cambodia to 
work on rebuilding an education system for 10 villages. 
</P>
<P>
The group is funded by subscriptions, private sponsors and public grants. It 
usually asks clients to pay for travel and accommodations for volunteers. When 
the project involves major funding, however, they work with other 
non-governmental organizations, such as the Friends of Mother Theresa. 
</P>
<P>
In his professional capacity, Le Duhan administered varied organizations that 
used public funding. He has used that experience in five trips to Africa to 
reorganize clinics, dioceses or manufacturers, often living in the poorest 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
He remembered with emotion the warm welcome he received: "It is always the poor 
people that give the most. Villagers were amazed and admiring of this old lady 
or this old man who came to see, talk and work with them instead of staying 
home and playing bridge." 
</P>
<P>
He said he is spiritually richer and has new vision: "Now I have a more 
realistic view of developing problems. But above all, I have discovered 
populations accepting their fate with a dignity and a happiness unknown in 
France."

PUB, NETWORK OF COUNTRYMEN MAKE U.S. LIFE A WEE BIT BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Gerry Mackey is sitting at the door of his Costa Mesa pub, the Harp Inn, where 
he greets -- by name -- each person who enters. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the pub is noisy, but not from loud music or even the wide-screen TV in 
the corner, where a Boston Celtics basketball game plays silently. The lively 
din comes from the customers -- laughing, telling stories, trading jokes. 
</P>
<P>
"The art of conversation is one of the greatest things we have to offer," says 
Mackey, stroking his graying beard. "Everybody knows everybody, which is rare 
for bars in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of bars put a shamrock or a leprechaun on the sign and call themselves 
Irish, but only a handful actually resemble a real Irish pub. Back home, the 
pub is a social center, not just a place to drink. 
</P>
<P>
"Our pub could, to a certain extent, be any little village pub in Ireland," 
says Mackey, and the clientele seems to bear out his boast. Irish brogues are 
everywhere, and the regulars include everyone from Irish-Americans several 
generations removed from their roots to new immigrants right off the plane. 
</P>
<P>
For Orange County's Irish, scattered over the suburban landscape, such spots as 
the Harp and the newer International Pub and Platter in Newport Beach provide a 
cultural touchstone, a place to share a common heritage for a people who 
cherish community values. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of Irish in Southern California," says Mackey, "but it's so 
spread out, it's difficult to get together in any sort of numbers." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980 census, the most recent local statistics available, 67,802 people 
in Orange County listed Irish as their single ancestry, while almost 300,000 
more said they were at least partly Irish. With no cohesive communities like 
those in such cities as Boston, New York and Chicago, Orange County's Irish 
community has been, until recent years, sprawling and largely assimilated. 
</P>
<P>
But since the early '80s, the local Irish community has been infused with a 
shot of new blood, as many young Irish have fled a stagnant economy that offers 
few job opportunities. The official unemployment rate in the Republic of 
Ireland has topped 20%, with the jobless rate for workers under 25 roughly 
twice that. 
</P>
<P>
So Ireland has lost a young, highly educated generation that has left the 
island nation's fabled green for the green of better job prospects abroad. Many 
have come to the United States, and while a good percentage settled in Irish 
communities in the East and Midwest, others have been enticed West by sunshine 
and a healthy economy. Some of them arrived legally, others not. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, about 35,000 Irish have emigrated legally to the United States, 
while about 40,000 more have overstayed their tourist visas and stayed 
illegally to work and live, according to figures provided by the Irish 
Consulate in San Francisco. All told, more than 175,000 have left the country 
in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Best guesses within Orange County's Irish community are that several thousand 
illegal Irish make their homes here. 
</P>
<P>
While most recent immigrants are from the Republic of Ireland, others have come 
from Northern Ireland. Though that country, part of the United Kingdom, is torn 
by political and religious unrest, recently arrived Northern Ireland nationals 
interviewed for this article say they came for jobs, just as their brethren to 
the south. 
</P>
<P>
Together, they form an almost invisible network -- the women working largely as 
live-in domestic help, the men in construction. 
</P>
<P>
Conor (not his real name) is one who came to Huntington Beach. He decided it 
was time to leave his County Meath home in the Republic of Ireland nearly five 
years ago, after placing number 2,400 out of more than 4,000 who took a civil 
service exam. 
</P>
<P>
The number of job openings? Six. 
</P>
<P>
"The early '80s were a bad time for Ireland," Conor said. About two-thirds of 
those with whom he graduated left the country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like many Irish men here illegally, Conor works in construction. He started in 
New York City, but headed west with a friend when the cold and grime became too 
much. Many of the illegal Irish, Conor said, hold college degrees, but cannot 
hope to land better-paying jobs because of their undocumented status. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people here, well-educated, that are wasting their careers in 
construction because they're not legal and can't get the jobs they're trained 
for," Conor said. 
</P>
<P>
"I got in the habit of being sneaky," confessed Niaiamh Smythe, who came to 
Southern California on a tourist visa, planning to stay just three months 
before returning to college in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to school from 7 in the morning to 10 at night, and when summer 
came -- and summer in Ireland isn't very summery -- I said, 'OK, I'll go to 
California and get skinny and tan and come back in fall,' " Smythe said. "That 
was 4 1/2 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Being an undocumented alien did not keep her from getting a job with a jeweler 
as a diamond appraiser, work she had done back home. But then the new 
immigration law passed in 1986, requiring employers to get proof of legal 
status from employees. Too embarrassed to tell her employers she was here 
illegally, Smythe told them she had been called back home because her mother 
had been in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
She has since started the paper work to become legal. When she started, she was 
told all she needed was $2,000 and a sponsor, but so far the process has taken 
three years and cost $3,500. She still does not have her green card, but she 
does have a labor certificate to allow her to work while she continues the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Smythe and most other Irish illegals didn't qualify for the amnesty program 
because they hadn't been in the country long enough. 
</P>
<P>
Obtaining legal status requires a sponsor, a job and enough money to pay a 
lawyer to get through the Immigration and Naturalization Service red tape. Once 
an application has been approved, the applicant must go through interviews at 
the American Embassy in the country of origin. For Smythe, that means flying 
back to Dublin once she is given notice to appear. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Smythe is working as a nanny in Long Beach and studying at the 
university there for a music and drama degree. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret (not her real name), 26, is also a Dubliner and a nanny for a 
Huntington Beach family. She has been here four years and has applied for a 
Donnelly visa, a special visa for west Europeans dispensed by lottery. But she 
does not have a lawyer or any plans to hire one. 
</P>
<P>
She said she is in no hurry because she is so attached to the family for which 
she works. She is paid $250 a week, plus gas money for her car and all her 
phone bills and room and board. She has two charges, a teen-age boy and a 
5-year-old girl. The girl attends school in the morning and Margaret is free to 
go her own way. 
</P>
<P>
Although she is happy with her present situation, that was not the case with 
the family that flew her from Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them just look for slave labor -- they don't care if you don't have a 
green card," Margaret said. "When I first came I made $90 a week plus room and 
board, but they wanted someone to cook their meals and clean (the house) and 
watch the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Helping young Irish women who have come over as nannies is a job Monica Keogh 
has been doing for years. As founding president of the Orange County chapter of 
the Ancient Order of Hibernian, she has aided young women in finding jobs and 
networking with other Irish in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The order, she said, was founded in the 1800s "for the protection of priests 
and domestics at a time when the Irish were facing great discrimination in this 
country," Keogh said. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband, John, came to California more than 30 years ago from their 
native Ireland when John was transfered by the aerospace firm where he worked. 
They moved from Northern California to Huntington Beach eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Though she never had to face being an illegal immigrant, Keogh said she 
understands the difficulties of being an undocumented worker from the young 
women she has met over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"To be young and illegal is terrible. Their life style does not allow them to 
flourish," she said with a sigh. She has many tales of young Irish who have 
been victimized because of their illegal status. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard of young men starting painting businesses and then not being paid 
when the job is done because the contractor found they were illegal," Keogh 
said. Some girls she knows "after five years are being paid $80 a week and 
giving money to their employers for a lawyer, and still don't have a green 
card," she said. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, though, Orange County's financial and recreational opportunities 
are enough to keep Conor and others working here -- at least for the time 
being. But all the undocumented Irish interviewed for this story talk of 
returning home someday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably stay in the States awhile. It's a great place to spend your 
20s," Conor said. "But when you're thinking of settling down, Ireland's a 
better country for raising your kids. That sounds terrible -- what I mean is, 
you always want your kids to be reared the same way you were reared," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Living here but planning to return home someday can keep some of the Irish from 
getting into serious relationships with Americans. One woman said she was 
engaged to an American for a time, but the differences in culture put a strain 
on them and the relationship ended. 
</P>
<P>
What are the differences? Most of the Irish interviewed, used to the tight 
social fabric of friends and neighbors back home, said they felt Americans were 
less sincere in their relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"Here couples get married and the first sign of frustration they get a 
divorce," Conor said. Divorce is still illegal in Ireland after a recent ballot 
measure to legalize it failed. 
</P>
<P>
Another Irishman said Californians take friendship too lightly. 
</P>
<P>
"They're your friend this week, in a month they move on," he said. "Back home 
you know you can count on a friend to stand by you in a rough time." 
</P>
<P>
Feelings of isolation are not confined to undocumented Irish, but are shared by 
many of the newly arrived who come legally. 
</P>
<P>
"Particularly in Ireland, the sense of community, the attachment, are much 
stronger than you would find here," said Cairen Murtagh of Newport Beach. His 
wife, Deirdre, agreed: "One is far more anonymous here." 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, the Murtaghs would seem a shining immigrant success story. A 
scant 14 months after arriving from Ireland, the couple enjoy well-paying jobs 
in their chosen fields -- he as a research chemist, she as a financial analyst 
-- and make their home in an upscale Newport Beach condominium within sight of 
the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Still, memories of the life left behind have proved hard to shake. Once, the 
Murtaghs talked about applying for U.S. citizenship after the minimum five 
years; now, they believe they might return home one day. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be foolish to view Ireland with totally rose-colored glasses," 
allowed Deirdre, 32. But, she said, "It seems most people we talk to talk about 
going back." 
</P>
<P>
Although the economy in the Republic of Ireland has stabilized somewhat, jobs 
there remain scarce. Many Irish in Orange County plan to stay at least for a 
time and are doing their best to adjust. 
</P>
<P>
The Murtaghs are helping to create an Irish Network in Southern California, 
patterned after one in the San Francisco Bay Area. The organization, with 120 
members so far (about 20 of them in Orange County), publishes a membership 
directory and organizes events. A recent talk drew more than 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be mostly of interest to the recently arrived," said Cairen 
Murtagh, although he estimates about 25% of the group's members are 
Irish-Americans. The network, which provides a chance to make both business and 
social contacts, is an attempt to create an Irish sense of community in 
fast-paced Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"It's working out that way," Murtagh, 39, said. "Our social life has picked up 
considerably." 
</P>
<P>
Leonore Coyne is an Irish-American who has come up with her own way to bring 
the community together. She put together a two-day Irish fair, held earlier 
this month in Laguna Beach, with authentic food, entertainment and contests. 
The event raised money for Straight Ahead Inc., a residential drug abuse 
program in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to bring back the times when I was very young," Coyne explained. Her 
father was an Irishman, and when Leonore was a youngster in Los Angeles, "every 
week he would bring me and my brother to these Irish dances at places that 
aren't even there any more." 
</P>
<P>
The Brothers of St. Patrick Novitiate in Midway City has become one network for 
the Irish in Orange County. Brother Edwin Guidera, himself an Irishman, is 
active in trying to establish an Irish youth center along with Keogh. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons the novitiate has attracted the Irish is through the Irish 
soccer leagues that play their games on the brothers' field. 
</P>
<P>
"We let them use the field in exchange for fund-raising support," said Brother 
Edwin, as he is most often called. 
</P>
<P>
Because the novitiate has become a meeting place for the Irish, Brother Edwin 
has organized events specifically for them. To mark St. Patrick's Day, Sunday's 
Mass will be said in Gaelic -- complete with a locally based Gaelic choir -- 
and a celebration will follow. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the biggest social centers for local Irish remain the pubs -- 
especially the Harp Inn. The Costa Mesa pub offers live Irish entertainment 
three nights a week, along with lessons in Irish dancing and Gaelic, and 
sponsors several sports teams: Irish and English soccer, hurling and Gaelic 
football. 
</P>
<P>
Videos of soccer games from back home are played on the pub's televisions, as 
are Irish newscasts broadcast weekly by a Los Angeles television station. Some 
American sports are popular too -- especially Notre Dame football. The Harp has 
darts and Guiness beer on tap -- it doesn't have pool tables, video games or a 
jukebox. 
</P>
<P>
And though the conversation flows, two topics stay largely off-limits: 
"Politics and religion are things that we don't discuss," says Mackey. While 
people keep informed on the situation in Northern Ireland, they keep their 
opinions on the matter -- and any affiliations to the combatants -- to 
themselves, according to Mackey. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a unique place in Orange County. It's not a yuppie bar," says 
Greg Kelley, an Irish-American who convenes local meetings of a Notre Dame 
alumni club at the Harp. "It's just a friendly Irish pub." 
</P>
<P>
Denis Murray and Terry McCarten are the Mulligans, an Irish music duo that has 
played pubs throughout Southern California for 10 years. The Mulligans also 
have some rock songs in their repertory, but can leave those aside when they 
play the Harp every Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"You know you have a real crowd when they just want the Irish stuff," McCarten 
said. "We get a great response from the crowd here." 
</P>
<P>
Set next to an industrial park behind Newport Boulevard, the Harp is easy to 
miss. But its reputation hasn't suffered -- it has even been written up in a 
small-town Irish newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason or another, they're pretty quick to find it," owner Mackey 
said of his customers. Though the Harp is just 2 years old, a number of 
marriages have already come of meetings there. 
</P>
<P>
Mackey, who first toured California as part of an Irish soccer team and fell in 
love with the weather, moved here from County Armagh in Ireland 10 years ago. 
"It's a big culture shock coming to the U.S. for the first time," he said. The 
Harp, he said, "gives them a little bit of the old sod."

'ITCHY FEET' LED DANCER TO AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARESA ARCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jackie O'Leary has one goal before she moves from Southern California: to have 
one of her dancing students compete in the national dance championships in 
Ireland. Then she can return triumphantly home there. 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary came to the United States nearly five years ago, looking for a chance 
to establish herself as a teacher of traditional Irish dancing, a national 
pastime back home. She had been dancing since she was 3 years old and scored 
very well in the national championships in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I got what my mother calls 'itchy feet,' and I don't know why but I've always 
had a dream to teach Irish dancing in America," she said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary, 24, was just 18 when she left her small town of Stranorlar in County 
Donegal for New York to be a nanny. After three months she had paid back the 
family for her plane ticket and a few months later left New York for home. But 
her wanderlust again got the best of her, and she landed a job as a nanny for a 
Florida family. At the same time, she applied for a visa. 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary worked for the Florida family for 1 1/2 years. By then her tourist visa 
had nearly expired and rather than ask for an extension, she went for a 24-hour 
cruise to the Bahamas, thus leaving the country and automatically extending her 
visa for another six months. 
</P>
<P>
Although the family she was with only paid her $80 a week, O'Leary said, she 
didn't mind. "They were a wealthy family and took me all over the United States 
on family holidays," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she eventually got itchy feet again and headed for Los Angeles. She said 
she never thought twice about leaving the safety of being a nanny. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a go-getter. All my brothers and my mother are like that," O'Leary said. 
"My father isn't, so I guess I got it from my mother. She calls me a tinker, 
like the Gypsies back home." 
</P>
<P>
Landing a job in Palm Springs, she took a job as a nurse's aide and lived with 
an Irish family she met there. She also started teaching Irish dancing through 
the city's Parks and Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
She moved again last November, this time to Huntington Beach to get training as 
an optician. Again she started teaching dance, and shortly afterward got her 
Donnelly visa and her green card, allowing her to work legally. 
</P>
<P>
"I got one, but I was doing fine without it," she said matter-of-factly. "Not 
having it didn't stop me from doing what I wanted to do, let's put it that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
She now teaches 35 students in Orange County but still occasionally travels to 
Palm Springs to teach her first dancing pupils. She teaches three days a week, 
at the Harp Inn in Costa Mesa on Tuesday nights and at Our Lady Queen of Angels 
Catholic Church in Newport Beach. Most of her students are Irish-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"They have their Irish heritage but they don't know the culture," she said. "At 
home, it's No. 1 with us. In some schools, especially where they teach the 
Irish language, it's mandatory." 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary, the only girl in a family with three boys, said she is very close to 
her mother and periodically brings her out for visits. Her mother made the 
costume that she wore for the national championships. 
</P>
<P>
"She took the design from the Book of Kells and did all the work by hand. It 
took her six weeks," she said with admiration. 
</P>
<P>
The ties with her family and the love of her culture have convinced her that 
she will someday return home to Ireland.

FINDING NEW HOME IN OLD COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1956, Frank O'Kelly and his future wife, Agnes, left Ireland for a new life 
in North America. But in a twist on their immigrant success story, their 
youngest son is hoping to make a permanent home in the country they left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll probably reverse the trend that I started," Frank said. "He's thinking 
of staying." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Jr. was one of the medical students "rescued" by the U.S. invasion of 
Grenada in October, 1983. Not wanting to return there, he was at a loss; Frank 
Sr. suggested his own alma mater in Galway, on the west coast of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
In the six years since moving there, Frank Jr. has gained an Irish bride, a 
baby daughter and a love of the country to which he displayed only a "weak 
attachment" as a youth, according to his father. "As a matter of fact, he's 
even picked up an Irish brogue," Frank Sr. said. 
</P>
<P>
But while Frank Jr. has been able to take advantage of one of Ireland's 
excellent universities, the chances that he will be able to put his education 
to work there are slim. "It's a completely closed shop there as far as the 
medical profession is concerned," Agnes O'Kelly said. "If he could make a 
living there, he would." 
</P>
<P>
The medical "closed shop" is the same dilemma that led Frank Sr., a urologist, 
and Agnes to leave Ireland. The republic, with its stagnant economy, has little 
hospital construction or expansion, and thus little job opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Out of 45 graduates in Frank's class, 40 left the country. He went to Toronto 
for his training, thinking that he might return in a few years, but he stayed. 
He married Agnes, a nurse, and together they had three sons. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to like the life," Frank said. In addition to the economic 
opportunities, he found that he enjoyed the less restrictive social structure: 
"That's probably the classic immigrant discovery -- that there's more freedom 
on the other side of the world." 
</P>
<P>
The O'Kellys moved to South Carolina in 1975, and to their home in Corona del 
Mar in 1979. Their hillside house commands a sweeping view of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Though Frank, 58, and Agnes, 55, have now spent more than half their lives in 
North America, they still maintain a hint of their accents and strong 
attachments to the old country. Their social circle includes Irish friends, and 
every week they listen to a local radio program broadcasting news from Ireland. 
Orange County even has its very own branch of the Galway Medical Graduates, to 
which they belong. 
</P>
<P>
They travel to Ireland frequently -- twice a year since their son moved there 
-- and now they have a piece of land on the island's west coast, where they 
hope to build a vacation home. While California is home now, "it's still nice 
to go back," Frank said.

ASK THE JUDGE: BANKRUPTCY WON'T ERASE STUDENT LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By B. TAM NOMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q I have made a mess of my life and am facing financial ruin. I am thinking of 
filing bankruptcy in order to try to start over again. One of my creditors is 
the government, for student loans. Since the government makes the laws, would I 
be too crazy to think that I won't be able to get out of my student loans? I 
just don't know how I can pay -- I don't even have enough to live on. 
</P>
<P>
BW, 
</P>
<P>
Orange 
</P>
<P>
A The law generally provides that student loans are not discharged by 
bankruptcy except under certain conditions. One of them is if payment would 
impose an undue hardship on a debtor and dependents. 
</P>
<P>
The court must determine what is undue hardship. Undue hardship is normally 
shown when a debtor's financial resources in the foreseeable future will not be 
sufficient for support at subsistence or poverty level standard of living while 
making payments. The debtor must show that he is, in good faith, minimizing 
expenses while maximizing resources through education and employment efforts. 
</P>
<P>
As with everything dealing with the law, every case may have its own set of 
unique circumstances that a general statement of the law may not address. You 
should always consult an attorney for advice in your situation. 
</P>
<P>
Q I just received my driver's license renewal form. As usual, it came with one 
of those organ donor cards. 
</P>
<P>
I would be interested in filling out the card and donating my organs, but it's 
a little scary to think about dying and being cut up. Can you tell me about the 
law? 
</P>
<P>
TI, 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
A The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act provides that any individual of "sound mind 
and 18 years or older" may give all or part of his or her body upon death. 
Other persons, normally certain relatives such as a spouse, adult child or 
parent, may also authorize the gift as long as the descendant has not indicated 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
You may revoke the gift at any time by a signed statement; an oral statement 
made in the presence of two people; any form of communication during a terminal 
illness to a physician; or, in cases where you have specified the donee, a 
signed statement to that donee. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Motor Vehicles is required to provide the necessary forms for 
making a gift and must make available pamphlets providing detailed information 
on this subject. You must sign the form for the gift to be valid. If you are 
unable to sign, the form may be signed by another individual and two witnesses. 
All three people must sign at your direction and in your and each other's 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
If this form is attached to your driver's license, revocation, expiration or 
cancellation of your license does not invalidate your gift. 
</P>
<P>
Please contact your local DMV for more information. 
</P>
<P>
Q I am the owner of a storage facility where people can rent space to store 
their things. I have had a couple of spaces where the rent has been long past 
due. I'd like to clean out the spaces and get rid of the stuff inside. Am I 
asking for trouble? 
</P>
<P>
CD, 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 
</P>
<P>
A The law generally provides that owners of facilities who rent individual 
storage space for personal property may have a lien on such property if the 
rent has not been paid for 14 consecutive days. Rental of a garage or other 
storage area in a private residence is not covered by this law. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain this lien, you must follow certain procedures that include notice to 
the renter that the lien will occur unless rental payment has been made. If the 
rent is not paid, you may sell the property and apply it to the rent, but only 
after again notifying the owner of the date and details of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
All of this can be quite complex, and you should consult an attorney before 
attempting to collect your rent in this fashion.

ON THE WATERFRONT: BOAT SHOWS TO MAKE A SPLASH AT TWO HARBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEARLEAN DUKE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Have the desire to peek inside a million-dollar yacht? There is no better place 
to fulfill it than a boat show, which is part carnival, part sales pitch and 
part seduction. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County will have three back-to-back, in-the-water boat shows in March 
and April that are expected to draw thousands of starry-eyed dreamers. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Point Harbor will hold its first show March 21 to 25 at the Dana Point 
Harbor Youth and Group Facility, 34451 Ensenada Place. 
</P>
<P>
You will barely have time to catch your breath before the next show begins 
March 29 at Lido Marina Village in Newport Beach. That show runs through April 
1 and is followed a few days later by the third and final show April 4 to 8, 
also in Lido Marina Village. 
</P>
<P>
All three shows will feature exhibits of marine accessories and nautical gear. 
The Dana Point show will also offer food, entertainment and a seafaring fashion 
show. 
</P>
<P>
The Dana Point show is the first in the harbor's 18-year history. It will 
feature about 65 boats in the water and another 70 on land, which will be 
overshadowed by the 300-boat fleet on view during the twin shows in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Ours is a fairly small show," says Dee Bower of the Dana Point Harbor Assn., 
sponsor of the event. "This is not as large as most of the boat shows and is 
not as commercial. This is more family fun." 
</P>
<P>
Included in the fun will be a 10:30 a.m. program March 24 that includes a Sabot 
race, fashion show, windsurfing exhibitions and a performance of sea chanteys. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, along with the harbor's three yacht clubs, will 
show videos about water safety and yacht club activities. The Nautical Heritage 
Society will conduct tours of its 77-year-old classic sailboat, the Virginia, 
which will be on display at the Youth and Group Facility. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to land exhibits and entertainment is free, but a $3 ticket is needed 
to go aboard the boats. Show hours are noon to 8 p.m. Wednesday, Thursday and 
Friday; 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday. Free shuttle 
service will be available at most area shops and restaurants on Saturday and 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach shows, now entering their 17th year, have become a spring 
tradition that draws about 10,000 visitors each. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 motor yachts, sport fishers, weekend cruisers and motor sailors will 
be on exhibit in the joint shows which open with a display of used boats. The 
following show on April 4 will feature new boats from top manufacturers around 
the world, according to Duncan McIntosh, show producer. 
</P>
<P>
Chief attraction, McIntosh admits, is the scenic harbor setting. "It's outdoors 
and it's a nice outing," he says. "And it presents a chance to look at big 
boats. Otherwise you would have to go from harbor to harbor to see this many 
boats." 
</P>
<P>
Show-goers can step aboard a variety of luxury yachts. 
</P>
<P>
"This year we have the opportunity to show an especially large selection of the 
kind of boats geared for Western boating," says McIntosh, who also serves as 
editor and publisher of Sea magazine. 
</P>
<P>
There's free parking and a free shuttle that runs every 20 minutes from a 
central parking lot off Tustin and Avon avenues in Newport Beach to and from 
Lido Village. 
</P>
<P>
Show hours are 11 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. weekdays, 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Saturdays 
and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sundays. Admission is $5 for adults and $2 for children 
ages 6 to 12. Children under 6 are admitted free. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paddy's parade: Boats will depart at 11:30 a.m. today in front of the 
Harbor Club, 3333 W. Coast Highway in Newport Beach, and return to the private 
club at 2 p.m.

EVEN AS A YOUTH, CHAVEZ WAS THE NATURAL

<P>
He has been the Natural since the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
He was 12 when he walked into Gymnasio Morelos in Culiacan, Mexico, and put on 
gloves for the first time. By several accounts, all the talent that Julio Cesar 
Chavez exhibits today -- many call him the world's greatest fighter, pound for 
pound -- was visible that day in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Antonio Lopez was there that day, which almost makes him a hero in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"You could see it that first day, the greatness," Lopez said as Chavez sparred. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just a little kid, but he could hit hard. He knew instinctively how to 
move his body and he had no fear. He even had that short left hook to the body, 
that first day." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, one of Chavez's trainers, pointed to a sparring partner, who kept elbows 
tucked low and close, protecting his rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
"All his sparring partners do that," Lopez said. "And no one ever taught him 
that punch. He did that when he was 12. That first day we saw him in the gym, I 
took him home to talk to his father. He was working, but I told his mother that 
Julio would be a world champion one day." 
</P>
<P>
Chavez seems too handsome, too pleasant when he flashes a toothy smile to fit 
the role of Mexico's mightiest warrior. 
</P>
<P>
But he fights almost dispassionately, seemingly giving his great talent free 
rein, his body following an almost programmed, inexorable path to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-eight fights have produced 68 victories, with 55 knockouts. One victory 
early in his career, was awarded him by the Culiacan Boxing Commission the day 
after a referee had disqualified him for hitting after the bell. 
</P>
<P>
Since the summer of 1984, when he won one of boxing's super-featherweight 
championships, he has been a champion in three weight classes and is 16-0 in 
championship fights, a record matched by few. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at the Las Vegas Hilton, Chavez will face his strongest challenge yet 
in Meldrick Taylor. At stake will be two junior-welterweight (140 pounds) 
championships, Taylor's International Boxing Federation title and Chavez's 
World Boxing Council title. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez is favored, but most boxing people see this as his toughest assignment. 
Taylor, 24-0-1, is the hardest hitter Chavez will have faced and, of at least 
equal importance, Chavez is coming up in weight to meet a naturally bigger 
fighter. 
</P>
<P>
In the last six years, Chavez has happily met and beaten everyone put in front 
of him. As a champion, he has beaten Roger Mayweather, Rocky Lockridge, Juan 
LaPorte, Edwin Rosario, Rodolfo Aguilar, Jose Luis Ramirez and Mayweather 
again. 
</P>
<P>
He stopped 11 of those 16 championship opponents, most of them in the late 
rounds, after his body punching had taken foes to levels of pain not previously 
experienced. 
</P>
<P>
"Other guys hit harder, but Chavez is so accurate and so tough inside," said 
Mayweather, who was stopped in the second round by Chavez in 1985 and in the 
10th last year. "He takes a lot out of you with those body shots because they 
add up. They start to hurt more as every round goes by." 
</P>
<P>
Chavez himself sees tonight's challenge as Taylor's, not his. 
</P>
<P>
"I've demonstrated that I'm a great fighter by winning three titles," he said, 
through Alberto Gonzales of San Diego, his financial adviser-interpreter. 
"Taylor is the one who must prove he is a great fighter by beating me." 
</P>
<P>
He is proud of his record and was irked by a Times boxing column this week in 
which it was pointed out that three boxing record-keepers list Chavez as 67-1, 
not 68-0. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to clarify I have not lost any fights," he said. "The only fights I 
have lost have been to my wife and my son." 
</P>
<P>
It's a mystery to many why Chavez isn't seen on billboards, and magazine and TV 
ads. One reason is he speaks no English, despite several attempts to learn 
through teachers. Now, he'll try the total immersion method, moving to the San 
Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
"Julio has a house in the Chula Vista area in escrow, five minutes away from 
where the U.S. Olympic Committee Training Center will be," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
"Julio trains so hard and fights so often, that he hasn't had time to really 
study English, or to fully exploit his name in Southern California. I convinced 
him he should live and train in the States, for at least part of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, 27, has lived in Culiacan since his father, Rodolfo Chavez, a railroad 
engineer for 30 years, moved his big family there from Ciudad Obregon when 
Julio was a child. Chavez is one of 10 children and the third-youngest of four 
brothers, all of whom have boxed. The youngest, Roberto, 18, is 19-1 as a 
professional. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez expressed some frustration at trying to manage Chavez's finances from 
another country. The Chavez entourage in Las Vegas is sizable, perhaps 12 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a very generous man to his friends . . . too generous," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who will make $1.4 million -- not counting Mexican television income -- 
on this fight, has invested heavily in Culiacan real estate, his adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
A victory over Taylor would probably enable Chavez to reach boxing's 
upper-income bracket, where Buster Douglas, Mike Tyson, Sugar Ray Leonard and 
Tommy Hearns dwell. This fight is Chavez's last under his contract with 
promoter Don King, and he is expected to become a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Wynn, the Mirage Hotel owner who has offered Douglas $25 million to fight 
Evander Holyfield, also has offered $4 million to Chavez for a fight with 
Hector Camacho. There would probably also be a junior-welterweight unification 
showdown with Juan Coggi of Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
But first, Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
The Chavez camp seems to expect this one to go to a decision. At a gathering of 
writers Tuesday, Chavez seemed to make a plea for a fair verdict. 
</P>
<P>
"This could be a long fight," Chavez said. "I would hope that the best fighter 
will get a fair judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez is picking his man by a decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Julio will win a decision, I think," he said. "Meldrick Taylor has only hand 
speed. Julio will wear him down because he is stronger, much stronger than 
Taylor." 
</P>
<P>
In sparring sessions here, Chavez has stepped in on sparring partners, thrown 
quick combinations and departed to move laterally. It suggests he may be 
planning not to challenge Taylor's strength, at least in the early rounds. 
</P>
<P>
He is The Natural, at the crossroads, a man who would be loved in America, as 
well as Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
He was asked the other day about $10-million-plus purses Tyson and Leonard have 
earned. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was an American, I would have already made that kind of money," he said, 
with a shrug. "But I am a Mexican. It will take time. Roberto Duran (a 
Panamanian) did it and he speaks no English. I will do it, too."
